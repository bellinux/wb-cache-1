5|$|Language contact {{may also}} lead {{to a variety of}} other {{linguistic}} phenomena, including language convergence, borrowing, and relexification (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). In situations of extreme and sustained language contact, it may lead to the formation of new mixed languages that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called pidgins occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case, they will often construct a <b>communication</b> <b>form</b> that has traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure. The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation of child learners grow up, the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called a creole language. An example of such mixed languages is Tok Pisin, the official language of Papua New-Guinea, which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and Austronesian languages; others are Kreyòl ayisyen, the French-based creole language spoken in Haiti, and Michif, a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American language Cree and French.|$|E

METHOD: We analysed inter-physician information exchange data derived from <b>communication</b> <b>forms.</b> The <b>communication</b> <b>forms</b> were, during a two-year prospective intervention trial, exchanged between 15 social insurance and 40 occupational physicians for 505 sick-listed patients.

Communication was implemented particularly for patients that had mental disorders, poor decision latitude, high physical work demands at their workplace, pronounced pain perceptions, bad work resumption prognosis, or work-related health disorders. CONCLUSION: A simple information exchange system already has the benefit to enhance inter-physician communication in disability management. status: publishe...|$|R

Although the benefits of information and communication technology are obvious in several cases, there still exists a lack of convincing measures {{for the value of}} using computers in education. This reflects the general difficulty in evaluating investments on information systems, known as the "IT investment paradox" that has not been solved so far. In this paper we approach the problem by estimating the amount of teaching and learning material in a target organisation, a university faculty. As expected, the volume of learning material dominates the communication of the faculty forming about 95 % of all communication volume and 78 % to 82 % of communication when measured with other metrics.

40|$|In {{the years}} 2004 - 2006 the Education Office and the Social Polices and Integration Office at the City Council of Modena {{designed}} three projects addressed to sustain social participation of Children of International Migrants (CIM) empowering their active citizenship. The premise of these interventions was that social integration depends on social participation. Social participation describes social {{actions that are}} both autonomous and visible in society. This projects looked at citizenship not {{as a sort of}} cognitive status to be reached but as the outcome of the experience of everyday participation to social processes. The activities proposed to CIM wanted to stimulate a reflection about everyday experience of participation to host social processes, with the help of adult social operators. Our research highlights that once they materialised in concrete interactions all of these three projects produced paradoxical results: it was possible to observe that social operators systematically violated CIM spaces of communication, that is to say CIM opportunities to experience, {{in the context of the}} social interventions, an active and autonomous social participation. Social operators interfered with CIM autonomous participation to interactions as soon as it brought about meanings inconsistent with the ideological and theoretical premises of the interventions; this brought CIM to mistrust their opportunity of an autonomous social participation. A social intervention aiming to offer an opportunity to experience social participation needs a <b>communication</b> <b>form</b> specialised in promoting self-expression of communicators, a <b>communication</b> <b>form</b> that creates mutual trust, that is able explore common ground and continuity of views between interlocutors.
