50|$|In 1762, he was {{appointed}} by Governor Robert Monckton to the New York Court <b>of</b> <b>Vice-Admiralty.</b> At {{the outbreak of the}} American Revolutionary War he sided with the Patriots, and resigned from the bench in 1775.|$|R
50|$|He was in Halifax in 1752, {{where he}} practised law and {{also was a}} {{merchant}} in partnership with William Nesbitt. In 1759, Suckling married Frances Duport, his second wife. In Quebec, he also served as advocate general for the Court <b>of</b> <b>Vice-Admiralty.</b> He left the province in 1771.|$|R
25|$|Joseph Underwood, a local merchant, {{acted as}} the crew's agent in {{claiming}} salvage from the Court <b>of</b> <b>Vice-Admiralty</b> at Sydney, {{but the court}} referred the matter to London. On 16 October, at Governor Lachlan Macquarie's request, Captain Eber Bunker sailed Seringapatam to England, where she was returned to her owner.|$|R
50|$|The {{jurisdiction}} of the High Court of Admiralty of England {{was transferred to the}} High Court by section 1(1) of the Administration of Justice Act 1956. The {{jurisdiction of}} the Courts <b>of</b> <b>Vice-Admiralty</b> in Her Majesty's possessions abroad was transferred to Colonial Courts of Admiralty by sections 2(3) and 17 of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act 1890.|$|R
50|$|The courts became quickly unpopular. This was {{not only}} because of the express {{prohibition}} of jury trials or the fact that vice-admiralty judges tended to believe that common law courts did not have superior status. It was also because a whole range of technical issues confused the legal system. It was often not clear whether vice-admiralty courts had jurisdiction over creeks or bays, or whether the governor could create vice-admiralty courts through vice-regal powers, or whether or not there was a clear method of separating the jurisdictions and procedures <b>of</b> <b>vice-admiralty</b> and common law jurisdiction. As a consequence <b>of</b> this, <b>vice-admiralty</b> courts became ineffective and, as many colonists perceived, unjust.|$|R
50|$|The first sitting of {{the court}} purported to be in 1798 when Governor Hunter convened the latter court to deal with charges of mutiny and {{attempted}} piracy. As Bennett has shown, whilst the court was convened as a vice-admiralty court, {{it was in fact}} the Court <b>of</b> <b>Vice-Admiralty.</b> No harm was done as the defendant was acquitted on the basis of insufficient evidence.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Belville, County Westmeath, Ireland on 21 May 1806, the eldest son of Charles Baggs and Eleanor Kyan. His father was a Protestant {{barrister}} of Dublin (Ireland), who afterwards was judge of the court <b>of</b> <b>vice-admiralty</b> in Demerara, British Guyana (South America). His mother was the fourth daughter of John Howard Kyan of County Wicklow. Through his mother's family he is directly descended from the O'Cahans, a significant Irish clan in Ulster.|$|R

50|$|He {{was born}} in Quebec City in 1798, studied there and was {{admitted}} to the bar in 1820. He joined the law practice of Andrew Stuart at Quebec City.

In 1840, he was named to the Special Council that governed Lower Canada after the Lower Canada Rebellion.

5000|$|Mr. Pinckney {{had studied}} law in England, {{and had become}} a {{politically}} active leader in the colony.

He was elected {{as a member of}} the Commons House of Assembly and Speaker of that body intermittently from 1736-1740, and he w{{as a member of the}} Royal Provincial Council. Eliza was unlike many women of her time, as she was [...] "educated, independent, and accomplished." [...] When the Pinckneys lived in Charleston, Eliza was soon planting oaks and magnolias at their mansion overlooking the bay, and corresponding regularly with major British botanists.|$|R
50|$|Previous {{attacks by}} the colonists on British naval vessels had gone unpunished. In one case, a customs yacht was {{actually}} destroyed by fire with no administrative response. But in 1772, the Admiralty would {{not ignore the}} destruction {{of one of its}} military vessels on station. The American Department consulted the Solicitor and Attorneys General, who investigated and advised the Privy Council on the legal and constitutional options available. The Crown turned to a centuries-old institution of investigation, the Royal <b>Commission</b> <b>of</b> Inquiry. This <b>commission</b> would be made up of the chiefs of the supreme courts of Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey, the judge <b>of</b> the <b>vice-admiralty</b> <b>of</b> Boston, and the Governor Joseph Wanton of Rhode Island. The Dockyard Act, passed three months earlier in April, allowed those suspected of burning His Majesty's vessels to be tried in England, but this was not the law that was used against the Gaspee raiders; they were charged with treason. The task <b>of</b> the <b>commission</b> was to determine against which colonists there was sufficient evidence for their trial in England. The Commission was unable to obtain sufficient evidence and declared their inability to deal with the case.|$|R
500|$|Nonetheless, Villiers {{continued}} to press his claims to office on Perceval, {{in a letter}} of 18 October 1809. He had, he said, turned down a pension of £1,200 p.a. for [...] "reasons...which can never be publicly alluded to" [...] and had received a promise from Portland to replace Fordyce as Surveyor General of the Land Revenues (a post worth £2,000 p.a.); Villiers would, however, {{be satisfied with the}} commissionership and £1,000 p.a. in addition, provided that he might retain his office of paymaster. In fact, that office was about to become the engine of Villiers' political destruction. He appears to have received the sinecure offices of registrar <b>of</b> the <b>Vice-Admiralty</b> Court <b>of</b> Gibraltar and marshal <b>of</b> the <b>Vice-Admiralty</b> Court <b>of</b> Antigua around this time.|$|R
2500|$|The British {{authorities}} foresaw {{the need}} for a civil judicial system to be established when the colony was first established. [...] A court styled the “Court of Civil Jurisdiction” was established by the First Charter of Justice as well as a Court <b>of</b> <b>Vice-Admiralty</b> pursuant to letters patent from the High Admiralty in Great Britain. [...] The Governor of New South Wales would also in time authorise magistrates (the common name for justices of the peace in the colony at the time) to determine smaller debt claims that were taking up the time of these original civil courts. [...] Hilary Golder points to research that magistrates were in fact dealing with small debt claims as early 1789, one year after the commencement of the colony.|$|R

50|$|Owing to bad health, he was induced {{to seek an}} {{appointment}} in Australia. Through the influence of his cousin Sir William Webb Follett, the then Attorney-General of England, he was appointed Master in Equity of New South Wales, and left London in September 1842 for Sydney. He landed on 1 January 1843, and held the post of Master in Equity, together with that of Chief Commissioner of Insolvent Estates, until his appointment as Resident Judge {{in the district of}} Moreton Bay (now Queensland) in January 1856. Then he returned to Sydney in February 1859, and was a Supreme Court Judge till his death on 26 May 1865 in Maitland, New South Wales. He held also during this period the offices of Judge of the Court <b>of</b> <b>Vice-Admiralty</b> and Primary Judge in Equity.|$|R

50|$|Moving into seal hunting, {{despite the}} decline of the industry, Underwood {{purchased}} a 186-ton hunting vessel and partook in whaling and acquiring seal oil. He expanded his fleet, importing pork from Tahiti and cedar and coal from Hunter River, sold seal skin in China, and imported tea from Bengal. On the return journey from Bengal he came across a derelict, the Seringapatam. The United States Navy had captured Seringapatam during the War of 1812, but mutineers and prisoners of war had recaptured her. Underwood acted as the crew's agent in claiming salvage from the Court <b>of</b> <b>Vice-Admiralty</b> at Sydney, but the court referred the matter to London. Macquarie eventually requested Captain Eber Bunker to sail Seringapatam to England, where she was returned to her owner. Underwood's other vessels continued to range across vast trading routes, reaching Batavia and Mauritius by the early 1820s.|$|R
50|$|Hopkinson held {{a number}} of legal and {{judicial}} positions, including judge <b>of</b> the <b>vice-admiralty</b> for the province of Pennsylvania. He was {{also a member of}} the Governor's Council. As a merchant, Hopkinson acted as agent for several London firms, and in partnership with William Coleman, imported and sold a wide variety of goods, including fabrics, spices, gunpowder and iron.|$|R
50|$|In 1808, Thorpe was {{appointed}} the first chief justice in Sierra Leone (chief justice and judge <b>of</b> the <b>Vice-Admiralty</b> Court). He {{presided over the}} cases of Samuel Samo (7-10 April 1812), Joseph Peters (11 June 1812) and William Tufft (12 June 1812). While Thorpe left Sierra Leone in 1813, he continued to serve until 1815, when he was dismissed from colonial service.|$|R
50|$|He {{decided to}} stay on in England to improve his {{credentials}} and reputation. In 1773 a gift of elk horns to the Royal Society got him elected as a Fellow. He entered the Middle Temple to study law and was called to the bar in 1775, also receiving an honorary DCL from Oxford University. He then managed to secure the position of judge of the Court of Common Pleas and judge of the Court <b>of</b> <b>Vice-Admiralty</b> in Montreal. He arrived in Quebec {{just prior to the}} American siege of the town in 1775 and was rewarded for his defensive activities in August 1776 with the post of Chief Justice of Quebec and an ex-officio place on the Council. However, a secret letter from Livius to the enemy commander was intercepted and resulted in Livius being deprived of his estates. After further clashes with Governor Guy Carleton he was dismissed from his post by the Governor in 1778.|$|R
50|$|The British {{government}} {{established the}} colony of New South Wales {{primarily as a}} penal colony {{with the intention of}} encouraging later settlement. Notwithstanding this, the colony’s principal purpose was to house prisoners from Great Britain. Captain Arthur Phillip was appointed as the colony’s first governor. The British authorities foresaw the need for a judicial system to be established in the colony to deal with civil matters. This was to be the present court, styled as the “Court of Civil Jurisdiction”, and established by a charter, as well a Court <b>of</b> <b>Vice-Admiralty</b> pursuant to letters from the High Admiralty in Great Britain. In time, the colony would take to authorising justices of the peace to determine smaller debt claims that were taking up the time of these original civil courts established.The institution of these first courts in the then fledgling colony were important first steps in establishment {{of the rule of law}} in Australia.|$|R
50|$|Obtaining a high {{reputation}} for business capacity and mastery of legal details, he rendered valuable service on several important commissions. He {{served on the}} commission appointed in 1811 to regulate the practice <b>of</b> the <b>vice-admiralty</b> courts abroad, and on that which was occupied from 1815 till 1824 in inquiring into the duties, offices, and salaries of the courts of justice and the ecclesiastical courts of England.|$|R
50|$|From 1736 to {{his death}} in 1741, Hamilton was the mentor of young Benjamin Chew, who later became Attorney General and Chief Justice of Pennsylvania. Hamilton was for many years a trustee of the general loan-office, the province's agency for issuing paper money. In 1737 he was {{appointed}} judge <b>of</b> the <b>vice-admiralty</b> court by Governor George Thomas, the only office he held {{at the time of}} his death.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Amherst, Nova Scotia, son of the Rev.
