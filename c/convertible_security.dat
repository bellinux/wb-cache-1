5000|$|A reverse <b>convertible</b> <b>security</b> or <b>convertible</b> <b>security</b> is a {{short-term}} note {{linked to an}} underlying stock.

50|$|A <b>convertible</b> <b>{{security}}</b> is {{a security}} {{that can be}} converted into another security. Convertible securities may be convertible bonds or preferred stocks that pay regular interest and can be converted into shares of common stock (sometimes conditioned on the stock price appreciating to a predetermined level). Warrants are equity convertible securities. They give the owner the option to buy newly issued shares at a determined exercise price and date. Equity capital notes are similar to warrants, except {{that there is no}} exercise price.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper offers}} a new {{explanation}} for the prevalent use of <b>convertible</b> <b>securities</b> in venture capital finance. <b>Convertible</b> <b>securities</b> {{can be used to}} endogenously allocate cash flow rights {{as a function of the}} state of the world and the entrepreneur’s effort. This property can be used to induce the entrepreneur and the venture capitalist to invest efficiently into the project. The result is robust to renegotiation and to changes in the timing of investments and information flows. The model is consistent with the observations that conversion is often automatic and that <b>convertible</b> <b>securities</b> are rarely used by outside investors...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the role of}} <b>convertible</b> <b>securities</b> in the {{financing}} of start-up enterprises when the entrepreneurs are better informed than the venture capitalists (VCs). We demonstrate that for a well-designed contract the conversion ratio of the securities {{can be used as}} a signaling device to overcome the problem of information asymmetry. If the variability of the return is sufficiently large, the entrepreneurs will find it desirable to rely on <b>convertible</b> <b>securities</b> with the conversion ratio revealing part of his information, that is, a ”separating equilibrium” will arise. Such an equilibrium has the advantage of avoiding the incentive constraints that appear in the other ”pooling equilibrium”, in which the privately held information is not revealed. We show that the time-lag of decisions between investment and conversion will also benefit the VCs, with the extra return as the ”time value”. In addition, we study the impact of introducing ”technical shares” with which the entrepreneurs are awarded equity shares without investment outlays. We compare the different financing devices with <b>convertible</b> <b>securities</b> and explain why <b>convertible</b> <b>securities</b> have become the most commonly used financial instrument for start-up enterprises.

50|$|Capital {{notes are}} {{a form of}} <b>convertible</b> <b>security</b> exercisable into shares. They are equity vehicles. Capital notes are similar to warrants, except that they often {{do not have an}} {{expiration}} date or an exercise price (hence, the entire consideration the company expects to receive, for its future issue of shares, is paid when the capital note is issued). Capital notes may be issued in connection with a debt-for-equity swap restructuring: instead of promptly issuing the debt-replacing shares, the company issues convertible securities, in order to postpone the event of share dilution.|$|E

5000|$|Value {{conversion}} is the act {{of converting}} one type of value or financial instrument into another type of negotiable value. In the securities profession the definition of conversion value is very narrowly defined as the positive difference between the market price of a <b>convertible</b> <b>security</b> and the price at which it is convertible. The larger topic of :Value conversion" [...] is relevant to the managing of intangible assets or intellectual capital. It refers to {{the act of}} transforming financial to non-financial value or an intangible asset into a financial asset. Intangible asset management has largely focused on valuation of intangible assets like trying to assign a financial value to an asset such as reputation. The theme of value conversion also runs through social exchange theory and more classical views of exchange value.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a new {{explanation for the}} use of convertible preferred equity in venture capital. It explains that the key feature of the <b>convertible</b> <b>security</b> is to create different cash flow rights for acquisitions and IPOs. It shows how the <b>convertible</b> <b>security</b> implements an optimal trade-off between the need to allocate cash flows to the venture capitalist and the desire to make efficient exit decisions. This approach also explains some puzzling contract features, such as automatic conversion in case of an IPO, or the use of participating preferred equity, where conversion never benefits the investors...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{cross-sectional}} {{analysis of the}} relationship between common stock price reactions to announcements of <b>convertible</b> <b>security</b> calls and variables that represent possible determinants of changes in common stockholders' wealth. The variables are measures of the following effects of <b>convertible</b> <b>security</b> calls: (1) the change in interest expense tax shields, (2) the potential redistribution of wealth from common stockholders to preferred stockholders and debt holders,(3) the decrease in the value of conversion privileges heldby <b>convertible</b> <b>security</b> holders, (4) the relative increase in shares outstanding and (5) the change in earnings per share. A significant relationshipis found only between the measure of the reduction in interest expense tax shields and the stock price response to call announcements. The apparent corporate tax effect is consistent with some combination of effects due to (1) a reduction in interest expense tax shields and (2) unfavorable information about the calling firm's value of earnings prospects that is conveyed by a call of convertible securities. The evidence is consistent with theories of capital structure that imply optimal financial leverage depends on earnings prospects and with theories that imply reductions in leverage convey unfavorable information about firm value. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{security}} {{design in}} a dynamic {{economy in the}} presence of status con-cerns. Our setting involves an entrepreneur with status concerns who has an idea for a project requiring an initial investment, which she raises by issuing a security to a financier. We characterize analytically the optimal security and find that its payoff profile is consid-erably similar to that of a <b>convertible</b> <b>security.</b> In contrast to existing explanations for convertible securities, ours does not rely on agency problems or asymmetric information. The more volatile the project is, the more similar the optimal security is to a <b>convertible</b> <b>security</b> [...] This is consistent with the observation that convertible securities are primarily used to finance relatively volatile projects. Our analysis uncovers the entrepreneur’s and financier’s risk attitudes as factors that can explain why convertible securities have different conversion ratios. While the paper focuses on convertible securities for expositional purposes, our analysis is potentially relevant for understanding a broader class of hybrid securities as well as executive compensation contracts...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} four empirical studies on firms’ financing decisions. In the first two studies, we investigate the debt-equity choice for {{a large number of}} U. S. firms. We find that firms prefer debt financing over equity financing in case a debt issue allows the firm to keep its investment grade rating. When the financing requirement becomes sufficiently large, firms are more likely to choose equity financing. We find that most firms repurchase debt instead of equity in case they have excess funds. The last two studies of this dissertation deal with <b>convertible</b> <b>security</b> design. Since convertible securities combine debt and equity characteristics, the specific structure of these instruments can provide further insight into the relevant costs and benefits of debt and equity. We find that taxes, the costs of refinancing, and the costs of managerial discretion are important drivers of <b>convertible</b> <b>security</b> design. We further find that the desire to manage earnings has been responsible for recent innovations in the convertible market. Convertible arbitrage drives the innovation of combining a convertible issue with a stock repurchase: the stock repurchase serves to mitigate the negative price impact that results from the short sales of arbitrageurs...|$|E

40|$|We posit {{that the}} effects of R&D {{investment}} on financing choices depend on the degree of intervention barriers and appropriation discrepancy between capital providers and the firm. Based on these two contingencies, we categorize financing instruments into four types: common equity (common stock), <b>convertible</b> <b>securities</b> (preferred stock and convertible debt), transactional debt (corporate bonds), and relational debt (bank and commercial loans). From the experiences of 39 petroleum firms during the period 1976 - 2005, we found R&D investment has a positive effect on the use of common equity, a U-shaped effect on the use of <b>convertible</b> <b>securities,</b> and an inverted U-shaped effect on the use of relational debt to raise capital. These effects are sustained over several years. Financing choice R&D investment Intervention barriers Appropriation discrepancy...|$|R
40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that security design reflects the interplay of capital supplier and security issuer preferences. While call provisions have historically been the default option in <b>convertible</b> <b>security</b> design, {{only a minority of}} post- 2005 issues are callable. Because hedge funds dominate the market for new convertibles today and because convertible arbitrage is less risky without callability, the recent diminution in the frequency of call provisions in new convertible bond issues illustrates the importance of the preferences of the suppliers of capital in security design...|$|E

The paper also derives the optimality of demand registration rights. ...|$|E
