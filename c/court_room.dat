5|$|In late October 2010, the Dutch court {{approved}} {{a request from}} Geert Wilders to have new judges appointed forcing the court to retry the case. On 7 February 2011, Wilders returned to the <b>court</b> <b>room</b> in order that his legal team could present evidence from Islamic experts which the court rejected in 2010, including Mohammed Bouyeri, who murdered film-maker Theo van Gogh, and Dutch academic Hans Jansen.|$|E
5|$|Brooks was {{assigned}} three prominent Minstrel attorneys, {{and after a}} year of sitting on the docket, at about 11 AM on April 15, 1874, Baxter's demurrer to Brook's complaint was suddenly called up. Neither of Baxter's lawyers were present in the <b>court</b> <b>room,</b> and the demurrer had been submitted without their knowledge. Without giving Baxter any time to testify, Judge Whytock overruled the demurrer and awarded Brooks $2,000 in damages and the office of Governor of Arkansas. Neither Brooks nor the court notified the legislature or Governor Baxter. Judge Wytock then swore in Joseph Brooks as the new governor of Arkansas, despite having no authority to do so.|$|E
5|$|In Gilroy and Hollister, sixteen {{people were}} injured, and damage totaled $500,000. Chimneys fell (especially on older {{homes in the}} {{downtown}} area of Gilroy) and glass was broken, but in Gilroy structural damage afflicted five buildings. A wall was cracked at city hall, and a <b>court</b> <b>room</b> ceiling collapsed. Damaged structural components at a Ford's Department Store forced its closure. In Hollister, a J. C. Penney had a hole and cracks in its ceiling and a parapet collapsed at a law office. At Casa de Fruta, a service station sustained structural damage, as did a fire station at Pacheco Pass.|$|E

5|$|In 1934, Lazzell {{was one of}} two West Virginians who {{received}} Federal Art Project grants through the Works Progress Administration. That same year she created a mural for a <b>court</b> <b>room</b> in the Monongalia County Courthouse entitled, Justice. The mural took fourteen weeks to complete. The mural is currently displayed at the Art Museum of West Virginia University in Morgantown, WV. She continued experimenting with woodprints and, in 1935, studied with the renowned German abstract expressionist Hans Hofmann in Provincetown. Hofmann's push/pull spatial theory is evident in the asymmetry of her later works. Lazzell's studies of flowers were inspired by her lavish potted gardens, such as Star Phlox (1931). Her 1948 floral print, Red and White Petunia, won first prize at the American Color Print Society exhibition. A collection of her prints are housed at the Art Museum of West Virginia University.|$|E
5|$|Southampton City Council {{appointed}} the design team in July 2009, naming Wilkinson Eyre as lead. A year later, Kier Southern were named as main contractor. Despite reservations over {{the appearance of}} the new pavilion, English Heritage gave their approval for the designs, and final planning permission was granted in September 2010. Work began in October. There were some obstacles to the build, contractors discovered significant corrosion to the original building's steel frame which had to be repaired. Adding the necessary security elements to cover museum exhibits in a listed building also proved challenging. Features from the original building were preserved in the design, the former prison cells were kept intact and used as toilet facilities, and a <b>court</b> <b>room</b> was preserved as an exhibition space.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to move city and county {{government}} functions {{out of the state}} capitol, the city purchased a plot of land to build on in 1832. They chose a spot on the edge of De Witt's public square, along Eagle Street at the eastern terminus of Lion Street (later renamed Washington Avenue); the land was bought from St. Peter's Church for $10,295.95 ($ in modern dollars). The design of the new city hall was done by Albany architect Philip Hooker. The cornerstone was laid by Mayor John Townsend amid a Masonic ceremony, however the date of this event is in dispute. The building was completed in 1832 {{at a cost of about}} $92,000 ($ in modern dollars). The new city hall was a Greek Revival structure, built of white marble with an entrance porch supported by four Doric columns. On the roof was a gilded dome. The interior was simple, with little ornamentation, though a full-length statue of Alexander Hamilton stood in the center of the upper hall, between the <b>Court</b> <b>room</b> and the Common Council Chamber. Upon one side of this hall was a bas-relief of DeWitt Clinton, with a view of a primitive canal-boat in the distance, and on the opposite wall was a similar figure of Sir Walter Scott. The building was destroyed by fire on February 10, 1880. Plans for a replacement city hall quickly developed.|$|E
50|$|The plan is {{symmetrical}} and identical on both two floors, {{which are}} {{connected by a}} round staircase. The connecting hallways follow the courtyard {{side of the building}} whereas the offices face the street. The <b>court</b> <b>rooms</b> are located in the south wing. There are four <b>court</b> <b>rooms,</b> located opposite each other, two on each floor. The two <b>court</b> <b>rooms</b> on the ground floor which were originally used for criminal cases are connected to the police station by an underground passageway. All four courtrooms have semi-circular reliefs by Utzon-Frank. Smaller ones designed by two students at the Royal Academy of Arts are found above the doors in the hallway on both floors.|$|R

25|$|On {{the evening}} of 18 April 2012, the website of The Scotsman {{newspaper}} made available an extended 6 minute 23 second video of the proceedings. The extended video comprises visual footage from the standardised 4 minute 40 second video but a different audio track. The extended version is of note, because the audio track comprises 66 seconds of Jack Davidson QC's plea in mitigation. It was previously stated in the press that this specifically would not be filmed. Also included in the extended version is 4 seconds of heckling {{from members of the}} public gallery as David Gilroy is being led away.

25|$|Located {{on lower}} Fifth Avenue {{at the corner}} of 12th Street in New York City’s Greenwich Village, Cardozo's urban campus is in a large building, known as the Brookdale Center. A multimillion-dollar capital {{improvement}} plan in 2006 included the acquisition of a residence hall one block away. The addition of more space at the Brookdale Center also allowed for a larger and significantly enhanced library, new offices and clinic spaces, as well as a new and larger lobby, moot <b>court</b> <b>room,</b> and ground-floor seminar room. In addition, older classrooms were renovated. In fall 2006, the Greenberg Center for Student Life, given in honor of former Dean David Rudenstine, opened. This addition to Cardozo included a new student lounge and a cafe on the third floor. Also completed were several new seminar rooms, internal stairways between floors, and windows on every floor.|$|E
25|$|Since Roshan's {{character}} was a paraplegic, Bhansali {{wanted to give}} him a natural look. Hence he was instructed by the director not to indulge in his regular workouts since he cannot look fit and trim in the film. He was also asked by the director to spot an original beard unlike the artificial one in his previous film, Kites, so as to give touches of authenticity to his character. The movie is set in Goa, and hence, Bhansali wanted to give a Portuguese touch to his frames. Sumit Basu, the Art Director, created Ethan's House in Mehboob Studio with a very Spanish/Portuguese flavour and the auditorium for magic acts, the <b>court</b> <b>room,</b> Martin's Bar in Yash Raj Studio. Also keeping in mind the costumes Bhansali hired Sabhyasachi Mukerjee as the costume designer, who had worked Bhansali in Black. Mukherjee had earlier worked in the film Raavan with Aishwarya Rai the same year.|$|E
25|$|Saul Bass {{designed}} emblematic movie posters {{that transformed}} the visuals of film advertising. Before Bass’s seminal poster for The Man with the Golden Arm (1955), movie posters {{were dominated by}} depictions of key scenes or characters from the film, often both juxtaposed with each other. Bass’s posters, however, typically developed simplified, symbolic designs that visually communicated key essential elements of the film. For example, his poster for The Man with the Golden Arm, with a jagged arm and off-kilter typography, starkly communicates the protagonist's struggle with heroin addiction. Bass's iconic Vertigo (1958) poster, with its stylized figures sucked down into the nucleus of a spiral vortex, captures the anxiety and disorientation central to the film. His poster for Anatomy of a Murder (1959), featuring {{the silhouette of a}} corpse jarringly dissected into seven pieces, makes both a pun on the film’s title and captures the moral ambiguities within which this <b>court</b> <b>room</b> drama is immersed.|$|E
