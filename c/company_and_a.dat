5|$|As in {{the first}} attempt, a Sa'iqa company from the 103rd Battalion would occupy {{positions}} four kilometers east of Budapest to isolate the fort. It would be supported by an AT-3 Sagger ATGM platoon. The main attack would be launched from the east by a Sa'iqa <b>company</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> company from al-Mezahi's battalion as the first echelon. Other units of al-Mezahi's battalion would conduct a secondary attack from the west, while one company remained in reserve near Port Fouad along with a Sa'iqa company. A reinforced company (less one platoon) of al-Mezahi's battalion would land by sea directly upon the Israeli fort. The attack would be preceded by a 30-minute-long fire preparation.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} Gulf Coast's {{cultural}} centers, Mobile {{has several}} art museums, a symphony orchestra, a professional opera, a professional ballet <b>company,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> large concentration of historic architecture. Mobile is known for having the oldest organized Carnival celebrations in the United States. The festival began to be celebrated {{in the first decade}} of the 18th century by its first French Catholic colonial settlers. Mobile was host to the first formally organized Carnival mystic society, known elsewhere as a krewe, to celebrate with a parade in the United States, beginning in 1830.|$|E

5|$|As the {{original}} expressway {{through the center}} of Detroit was being planned in the 1940s, it was unofficially named the Harper–McGraw Expressway after the streets along which it was to run. There was some initial support to name it after Roy Chapin, the late president of the Hudson Motor Car <b>Company</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> former United States Secretary of Commerce under President Herbert Hoover. On April 23, 1946, the Detroit Common Council voted instead to name the highway after Edsel Ford, the son of Henry Ford and president of the Ford Motor Company from 1918 until his death in 1943.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 20/21 September, the 16th and the 19th Divisions marched {{to the west of}} Nablus, under Liman von Sanders orders, where they linked up with von Oppen's Asia Corps. The next morning, von Oppen reorganised the Asia Corps by amalgamating the {{remnants}} of the 702nd and 703rd Battalions into one, with a rifle company, a machine gun <b>company</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> trench mortar detachment, while the 701st Battalion with its machine gun company, six guns, a troop of cavalry, an infantry-artillery platoon with two mountain guns or howitzers and a trench mortar section with four mortars and a cavalry squadron, remained intact.|$|E
5|$|During the night, the Asia Corps {{lost touch}} with the 16th and 19th Divisions, but {{following}} the direct orders of Liman von Sanders, these divisions withdrew {{to the west of}} Nablus. Here von Oppen got in contact with them during the morning of 21 September. At that time the remains of the 702nd and 703rd Battalions were reformed into one battalion, supported by a rifle company, a machine gun <b>company</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> trench mortar detachment. The 701st Battalion with its machine gun company of six guns, a troop of cavalry, an infantry-artillery platoon with two mountain guns or howitzers and a trench mortar section with four mortars and a cavalry squadron, remained intact.|$|E

5|$|In 1902, the First Roumanian-American congregation/Congregation Shaarey Shamoyim {{purchased}} the Rivington Street building from the Church Extension and Missionary Society {{to satisfy a}} need for a larger building to serve the Lower East Side's rapidly growing Romanian-Jewish population. At the time, the property was valued at $95,000 (today $). The funds for the purchase were raised from the members of the congregation, and to honor those contributing $10 or more, names were engraved on one of four marble slabs in the stairway to the main sanctuary. The most generous gift was $500, at a time when $10 was two weeks' pay. The congregation also took out two mortgages; one for $50,000 (today $) with the Title Insurance <b>Company,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> second for $30,000 (today $) with the Church Extension and Missionary Society.|$|E
5|$|In early 2010 Estianty {{established}} {{the recording studio}} Le Moesiek; several established artists, including Krisdayanti and Julia Perez, signed on quickly. At the time she owned five other business ventures, including a steakhouse, an outsourcing <b>company,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> cafe. Estianty was reported in October 2010 {{to be working on}} a cover album which featured works originally sung by Nike Ardilla, Hetty Koes Endang, and AtiekCB. Later that year she was chosen as Ambassador on Domestic Violence by the Indonesian Ministry for Women's Issues. Dhani objected to the appointment and threatened to sue the ministry, as he took offence to suggestions that he had abused Estianty.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} structure, {{the early months}} of the battalion's {{existence}} was a period of flux. The early 2nd AIF infantry battalions were established with a structure that was unique to the Australian Army; however, shortly after formation it was decided that they would adopt the British Army battalion structure. Thus, by December 1940, the 2/9th had an authorised strength of around 900 personnel and consisted of four rifle companies (each consisting of three platoons with three sections), a battalion headquarters, a support <b>company,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> headquarters company consisting of six platoons performing specialist roles including signals, mortar, and anti-tank. The four rifle companies were designated 'A' through to 'D'. The colours chosen for the battalion's Unit Colour Patch (UCP) were the same as those of the 9th Battalion, a unit which had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were black over light blue, in a horizontal rectangular shape, although a border of gray was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart.|$|E

5|$|Lord Selkirk was {{involved}} with the first permanent settlement (known as the Red River Colony), the purchase of land from the Hudson's Bay <b>Company,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> survey of river lots in the early 19th century. The North West Company built Fort Gibraltar in 1809, and the Hudson's Bay Company built Fort Douglas in 1812, both {{in the area of}} present-day Winnipeg. The two companies competed fiercely over trade. The Métis and Lord Selkirk's settlers fought at the Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816. In 1821, the Hudson's Bay and North West Companies merged, ending their long rivalry. Fort Gibraltar was renamed Fort Garry in 1822 and became the leading post in the region for the Hudson's Bay Company. A flood destroyed the fort in 1826 and it was not rebuilt until 1835. A rebuilt section of the fort, consisting of the front gate and a section of the wall, is near the modern-day corner of Main Street and Broadway Avenue in downtown Winnipeg.|$|E
5|$|McCauley {{established}} a livery business, {{the first of}} the kind in Fort Garry (later Winnipeg). He married Matilda Benson of Sarnia, Ontario in 1875, and resided in Fort Garry with her for the next four years, where he continued to operate his livery business. After growing restless in Winnipeg in 1879, McCauley sold his business and traveled west, this time to Edmonton. McCauley arrived in Edmonton in the fall of 1879 after 21 days of travelling by ox cart. He purchased a farm in Fort Saskatchewan the following spring, and farmed for two years before moving to Edmonton in 1882. In Edmonton, he opened the town's first livery and cartage business, the Edmonton Cartage <b>Company,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> butcher shop in 1883.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in August 2005 an Australian Special Forces Task Group (SFTG) was {{deployed}} to Afghanistan {{as part of}} Operation Slipper, operating in the southern province of Uruzgan. The SFTG, based on similar structure deployed during Operation Falconer, {{was made up of}} elements from the SASR, a commando <b>company</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> troop from the Incident Response Regiment. Two CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the 5th Aviation Regiment were {{deployed to}} Afghanistan in March 2006 to support the SFTG. A forward operating base was subsequently established at Tarin Kowt. During this deployment the Commandos were involved in Operation Perth which resulted in the death of over 150 Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters in nine days of fierce fighting in the Chora district of Uruzgan Province. The SFTG was withdrawn from Afghanistan in September 2006 and replaced by a Reconstruction Taskforce made up of engineers and conventional infantry. During this period the task group was on patrol for 306 days and involved in 139 contacts and sustained 11 soldiers wounded.|$|E

5|$|North Korean troops {{continued}} {{attacking the}} 24th Infantry all across its line, probing for weaknesses. On August 25 and 26, C Company beat off several more North Korean attacks on Battle Mountain coming along the long ridge extending from Tundok. At {{one point in}} these fights, a flight of US Air Force aircraft caught about 100 North Korean soldiers in the open and immediately napalmed, bombed, and strafed them. The North Korean force was destroyed with few survivors. Task Force Baker, comprising C <b>Company</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> platoon of E Company, 24th Infantry with an ROK police company, defended Battle Mountain at this time. The special command was established because of the isolated Battle Mountain area and the extended regimental battle front. For the next two days, air strikes continued to rack North Korean counterattacks and {{to prevent them from}} forming into any serious attack on Battle Mountain.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April, the JNA {{established}} a buffer zone {{to separate the}} belligerents at Plitvice Lakes, deploying elements of the 1st and the 5th Military Districts. Those were an armoured battalion of the 329th Armoured Brigade based in Banja Luka, a battalion of the 6th Mountain Brigade based in Delnice, a reconnaissance <b>company</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> mechanised battalion of the 4th Armoured Brigade based in Jastrebarsko and Karlovac, a battalion of the 306th Light Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment based in Zagreb, a signals company of the 367th Signals Regiment based in Samobor, a company of the 13th Military Police Battalion based in Rijeka and an anti-aircraft artillery battery drawn from the 13th Proletarian Motorised Brigade based in Rijeka. Finally, the 5th Military District set up a forward command post at the Plitvice Lakes. The JNA force at the Plitvice Lakes was commanded by Colonel Ivan Štimac.|$|E
5|$|On July 29 the 1st Battalion {{suffered}} {{about 60}} casualties from North Korean mortar fire. As {{the men were}} preparing their perimeter defense for the night, a general panic arose, {{for reasons that are}} still unclear. Most of them deserted their positions in a state of alarm. Colonel White found himself, the 77th Combat Engineer <b>Company,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> battery of the 159th Field Artillery Battalion all that was left in the front line. He had to personally reorganize the battalion as many of his officers were unable to get the men to listen to them. As White tried to rally his men, the field artillery maintained a sustained barrage of fire to slow the North Koreans advance. That night alone the artillery fired 3,000 rounds in holding back the North Koreans.|$|E
