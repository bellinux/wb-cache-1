25|$|Methanol (also {{known as}} methyl alcohol, <b>carbinol,</b> wood alcohol, wood naphtha or wood spirits) is a {{chemical}} compound with chemical formula CH3OH. It is the simplest alcohol, {{and is a}} light, volatile, colorless, flammable, poisonous liquid with a distinctive odor that is somewhat milder and sweeter than ethanol (ethyl alcohol). At room temperature, it is a polar solvent and is used as an antifreeze, solvent, fuel, and as a denaturant for ethyl alcohol. It is not popular for machinery, but {{may be found in}} automotive windshield washer fluid, de-icers, and gasoline additives.|$|E
500|$|This {{prompted}} {{further exploration}} of the chemical behavior of complexes of dubnium. Thousands of repetitive chromatographic experiments were performed jointly in various labs between 1988 and 1993. All group 5 elements and protactinium were extracted from concentrated hydrochloric acid; at lower concentrations of hydrogen chloride, small amounts of hydrogen fluoride were added to start selective re-extraction. Dubnium showed a behavior {{different from that of}} tantalum at concentrations of hydrogen chloride below 12 moles, following the behavior of niobium and the pseudohomolog protactinium. Because of this similarity to these two elements, the research suggested that the formed complex was either [...] or [...] After extraction experiments of dubnium from hydrogen bromide into diisobutyl <b>carbinol</b> (2,6-dimethylheptan-4-ol), a specific extractant for protactinium, with subsequent elutions with the hydrogen chloride/hydrogen fluoride mix as well as hydrogen chloride, dubnium was found to be less prone to extraction than both protactinium and niobium. It was explained as an increasing tendency to form non‐extractable complexes of multiple negative charges. Further experiments in 1992 confirmed the stability of the +5 state: Db(V) was shown to be extractable from cation‐exchange columns with α‐hydroxyisobutyrate, similarly to other group 5 elements and protactinium; Db(III) and Db(IV) were not. In 1998 and 1999, new predictions suggested dubnium would extract nearly as well as niobium and better than tantalum from halide solutions, which was later confirmed.|$|E

50|$|Some spiro {{compounds}} can be synthesized {{using the}} Pinacol-pinacolone rearrangement; for example, spiro5.4decane (final compound in following two line scheme) can be synthesized from symmetric 1,2-diols {{of the sort}} shown below this route's starting material, (1,1′-bicyclopentyl)-1,1′-diol. Initially, one of the <b>carbinol</b> moieties is protonated, allowing water to leave, and yielding the corresponding carbocation (second structure, first row); this intermediate then undergoes a bond migration, resulting in ring expansion of the adjacent ring, with deprotionation unmasking the ketone functional group to complete {{the first line of}} the mechanism. This first product, a spirobicyclic ketone, is a spiro compound in its own right, and yields the further spiro <b>carbinol</b> and the alicyclic spiro hydrocarbon after two further reduction reactions. First, reduction of the carbonyl that ends the mechanism's first line provides the spiro <b>carbinol</b> starting material of the second line, which is needed for reduction to the alkane (shown). This latter reduction is accomplished using lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4), via the alcohol tosylate (formed using tosyl chloride). Hence this three reaction sequence provides three spiro compounds (ketone, alcohol, and alkane), of possible research or practical use.|$|E
40|$|The {{enantioselective}} allylation of ketones represents both {{a problem}} of fundamental importance in asymmetric reaction design and {{one of only a}} very small number of available methods to access valuable tertiary <b>carbinols.</b> Despite the vast amount of attention from chemists that this problem has elicited, 1 - 8 however, success has generally been limited to just a few simple ketone types thus limiting the utility of these methods. A method for the selective allylation of functionally complex ketones would be expected to increase the utility of ketone allylation methods in the chemical synthesis of important targets. Here we describe the operationally simple, direct, regioselective, and enantioselective allylation of β-diketones. The strong tendency of β-diketones to act as nucleophilic species was overcome by the co-optation of their enol form to provide the necessary Brønsted acid activation. This unprecedented reaction thus not only significantly expands the pool of enantiomerically enriched and functionally complex tertiary <b>carbinols</b> that may be easily accessed, but also overturns more than a century of received wisdom regarding the reactivity of β-diketones.
