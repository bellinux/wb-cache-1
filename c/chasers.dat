5|$|The ensuing {{confusion}} allowed Belvidera to fire her stern <b>chasers,</b> killing {{six more}} men aboard President. Rodgers {{kept up the}} pursuit, using his bow <b>chasers</b> to severely damage Belvideras rigging, but his two broadsides had little effect. The crew of Belvidera quickly made repairs to the rigging. They cut loose her anchors and boats and pumped drinking water overboard to lighten her load, thereby increasing her speed. Belvidera soon gained enough speed to distance herself from President, and Rodgers abandoned the pursuit. Belvidera sailed to Halifax to deliver the news that war had been declared.|$|E

5000|$|Today Tonight ran {{segments}} demonstrating contrivances in <b>Chaser's</b> stunts and criticising their breakthrough of APEC's security. However, when Today Tonight {{asked if}} they could follow The <b>Chaser</b> team on one of their stunts, The <b>Chaser</b> agreed. The <b>Chaser</b> chose a stunt that would embarrass the Channel 7 television program. They did so by having a [...] "Meakin Booze Bus"; in reference to Channel 7 boss Peter Meakin, who had recently been convicted of driving whilst under the influence of alcohol. In the shoot, The <b>Chaser</b> members repeatedly raised the topic of Peter Meakin to reporter James Thomas. It was revealed later that The <b>Chaser</b> did eventually answer enough of Thomas’ questions so that Today Tonight received what they wanted, but Today Tonight did not end up running that footage. Channel 7 broadcast scenes that they judged made the <b>Chaser</b> crew look arrogant, although it was stated in The <b>Chaser's</b> season 2 DVD commentary that James Thomas later called The <b>Chaser</b> team and apologised for the way Today Tonight depicted them in the report.Channel 7 began airing repeats of The <b>Chaser</b> in September 2011.|$|R
5|$|On June2, {{dozens of}} members of the storm chasing and {{spotting}} communities coordinated a tribute to Tim Samaras, Paul Samaras, and Carl Young. Using GPS transponders over Spotter Network, they aligned themselves to spell out the initials of the three men in North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska for many hours. The Discovery Channel scheduled a special tribute episode of Storm <b>Chasers</b> titled Mile Wide Tornado: Oklahoma Disaster on June5, both honoring the three <b>chasers</b> and covering the events of the EF5-rated tornado that struck Moore and portions of southern Oklahoma City eleven days earlier on May20. The November 2013 issue of National Geographic, for its featured cover story, paid tribute to Tim Samaras, a National Geographic Explorer funded in part by the Society, and featured a detailed scientific analysis of the tornado itself.|$|E

5|$|Oscar Finley and Wally Figg are the bickering {{partners}} {{of a small}} law firm in the South Side of Chicago; in fact, {{for much of the}} time they are just a pair of ambulance <b>chasers.</b> Oscar's character holds the firm together despite the childish and unethical behavior of Wally, his junior partner. Their bickering is often mediated by Rochelle, the highly competent African American secretary, who had learned a lot of law in her eight years in the office. Meanwhile, David Zinc, a graduate of the Harvard Law School, is completely fed up with the grinding and dehumanizing – though well-paid – life of an associate in the law firm of Rogan Rothberg, where in five years of work he had never seen the inside of a courtroom, in fact, David's expertise was in long-term bonds a job he hated. David suddenly breaks away, goes on a drinking binge and by chance finds himself at the Finley & Figg office. Feeling an elevating sense of freedom and vowing never to go back, Zinc willingly relegates himself to working for the two disreputable street lawyers and ambulance <b>chasers.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Typhoon Pamela {{were from a}} {{tropical}} disturbance that persisted in {{the eastern end of}} the equatorial trough on May13. At the time, it was located about 425km (265mi) north of Chuuk in the Federated States of Micronesia. The disturbance was initially difficult to locate as it tracked generally to the south and southwest, a motion caused by a southward-moving tropical upper tropospheric trough. On May14, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) indicated that the system developed into a tropical cyclone. That same day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) followed suit and classified it as Tropical Depression 06W. The next day, data from the Typhoon <b>Chasers</b> indicated that the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Pamela. It was able to intensify after the trough receded northward, developing outflow. The storm turned to the south and east, gradually executing a counterclockwise loop through the FSM. This was due to a building ridge between Pamela and Typhoon Olga to its west. On May16, observations from Satawan in the Caroline Islands indicated that Pamela attained typhoon status, which is a tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of at least 118km/h (74mph). This was confirmed the next day by the Typhoon <b>Chasers.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{wings of}} dragonflies are {{generally}} clear, {{apart from the}} dark veins and pterostigmata. In the <b>chasers</b> (Libellulidae), however, many genera have areas of colour on the wings: for example, groundlings (Brachythemis) have brown bands on all four wings, while some scarlets (Crocothemis) and dropwings (Trithemis) have bright orange patches at the wing bases. Some aeshnids such as the brown hawker (Aeshna grandis) have translucent, pale yellow wings.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1918, {{with the}} war going against the Austrians, Radetzky was {{prepared}} {{to be transferred to}} the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. On 10 November 1918 — six days after the Austrian armistice — Yugoslav navy officers sailed the battleship out of Pola and surrendered it to a squadron of American submarine <b>chasers.</b> Under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the transfer was not recognized; instead, Radetzky was given to Italy and broken up for scrap.|$|E

In the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the transfer was not recognized; instead, Zrínyi was given to Italy and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|An SOS was broadcast, {{which was}} {{answered}} by the Brazilian Navy, which sent three submarine <b>chasers</b> and three destroyers to the scene. The passengers {{were ordered to}} take to the lifeboats. Tenders and tugs also assisted in the rescue of all passengers from Magdalena without loss of life. The sea conditions at the time were smooth. At 19:00, the steam turbines had to be shut down, and power was then provided by her auxiliary diesel engines. At about 20:00, the submarine chaser Guaporé arrived and started to rescue the passengers. Other ships which assisted in the rescue were the tugs Comandante Triunfo, Dorat, Saturno and Trovão, and also the cargo ship Goiaz.|$|E
5|$|By 12:00, Woodriff had {{realised}} {{that the}} approaching ships {{did not know}} the recognition signals and therefore must be enemies. With his first priority to protect his convoy, Woodriff sent an urgent message to Indus, the largest and strongest of the merchant ships, to lead {{the main body of the}} convoy ahead eastwards at all speed. With his most valuable charges now making distance away from the French, Woodriff persuaded the captain of Brothers to sail northwards while he intended to engage the French directly and draw them southwards, away from the Saint Helena convoy and also away from the projected track of the Illustrious convoy. Once the merchant ships were gone beyond the horizon, Woodriff turned Calcutta about and sailed directly for the nearest French ship, the frigate Armide, which was gaining on his vessel. Armide was far more nimble than the lumbering Calcutta, and rapidly passed her out of range of her broadside, the frigate turning about and opening fire with her stern <b>chasers,</b> cannon mounted in the rear of the ship, at 15:00. Calcutta replied ineffectually with her bow <b>chasers,</b> until Armide allowed the British ship to draw alongside. The two ships then opened a heavy fire on one another which continued for an hour until Armide, with her rigging badly damaged, drew back towards the rapidly approaching French squadron.|$|E

50|$|When {{the second}} phase of the round begins, the <b>chaser</b> has two minutes to catch the contestants. To do so, the <b>chaser</b> must match the number of the steps that the contestants earned in the first phase, by {{correctly}} answering as many questions as possible within the time limit. However, should the <b>chaser</b> either give an incorrect answer or pass on a question, the clock is briefly stopped and the question is thrown over to the contestants, who can push the <b>chaser</b> back a step if they can give a correct answer. From series 3 onwards, a new rule was added in which if the contestants answer the <b>chaser's</b> question correctly whilst the <b>chaser</b> is at the starting line, an additional step is added to the requirement for the <b>chaser.</b>|$|R
5|$|Early {{in the wet}} stage, a {{group of}} nine riders broke away, only to be pulled back the peloton, with a second group of {{nineteen}} also failing. An unsuccessful move from Tony Martin was followed by an attack by Vincenzo Nibali over the Col de Grimone {{and the formation of}} an elite five-strong group on descent with Rui Costa, Alejandro Valverde, and Tony Gallopin. This attack reduced the main group of <b>chasers</b> and caused the abandonment of several riders. The advantage of the break was over three minutes as they climbed the Col de Rousset, with Nibali briefly escaping on the subsequent descent.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1970s, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) {{increased}} {{its efforts to}} train storm spotters to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and flash flooding. The program was called Skywarn, and the spotters were local sheriff's deputies, state troopers, firefighters, ambulance drivers, amateur radio operators, civil defense (now emergency management) spotters, storm <b>chasers,</b> and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can warn of the hazard.|$|E
5|$|Later, Millennium Group {{offender}} profilers Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) {{investigate the}} disappearance of a bus full of schoolchildren. They believe the driver was also a victim, and not responsible; they meet with the local sheriff, John Cayce (Steven Rankin), who has dredged the bus from a lake. It is empty, but inside, Black experiences the same vision as Prine. He also finds paint transfer on the exterior, indicating the perpetrator was driving a white van. A false positive results as police apprehend storm <b>chasers</b> in a different van, who warn that a violent tornado is approaching.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Chaser</b> {{election}} specials are {{a number}} of Australian political satire based comedy programs produced by The <b>Chaser.</b> The shows, which have run under various titles, provide commentary on Australian federal election and has been produced since 2001 for ABC TV. The first show, The Election <b>Chaser</b> in 2001 was the first ever television production of the The <b>Chaser</b> team. In 2004 and 2007 they produced The <b>Chaser</b> Decides which won the Logie Award for [...] "Most Outstanding Comedy Program" [...] for the 2004 series.

50|$|After the {{two minutes}} are up (and {{following}} a short {{preview of the}} 6:00 pm news) the <b>chaser</b> is also given two minutes of quick-fire questions to attempt to catch the team.

If the contestants answer the <b>chaser's</b> question correctly whilst the <b>chaser</b> is at the starting line, an additional space is added to the requirement for the <b>chaser.</b> If the <b>chaser</b> succeeds in catching the contestants before the clock runs out, the contestants lose the prize pot and leave with nothing. If the contestants are not caught by the <b>chaser,</b> the prize pot is split equally between those contestants participating in the Final Chase.
