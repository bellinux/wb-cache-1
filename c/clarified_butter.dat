It is a {{producer}} of agricultural produce such as millets, ghee (<b>clarified</b> <b>butter),</b> oilseeds, and salt, which are transported from its port. A long term development plan was proposed in 2011 with investment of ₹830 million to refurbish the city of Dwarka and to build a bridge connecting the city with Okha and Bet Dwarka.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, lard {{is used to}} fry the chicken, but corn oil, peanut oil, canola oil, or {{vegetable}} oil are also frequently used (although <b>clarified</b> <b>butter</b> {{may be used as}} well like in colonial times). The flavor of olive oil is generally considered too strong to be used for traditional fried chicken, and its low smoke point makes it unsuitable for use. There are three main techniques for frying chickens: pan frying, deep frying and broasting.|$|E

5|$|Dwarka's economy {{relies heavily}} on pilgrims and tourism but is {{supplemented}} by the production of millets, ghee (<b>clarified</b> <b>butter),</b> oilseeds, and salt, which are transported from its port. A long-term development plan was proposed in 2011 by the Government of Gujarat, with investment of ₹830 million to refurbish the city of Dwarka and build a bridge connecting the city with Okha and Bet Dwarka. Janmashtami is the main festival that is celebrated during August and September. Sharda Peeth Vidya Sabha is an educational society sponsored by the Sharda Peeth, Dwarka which runs an arts college in Dwarka.

5|$|The Upanishad {{suggests}} {{breathing exercises}} {{in a variety}} of ways, such as breathing with one nostril and exhaling with another, asserting that a regular practice multiple times a day cleans up the Nadis (blood vessels), improves digestive powers, stamina, leanness and causes the skin to glow. The text recommends restraining oneself from salt, mustard, acidic foods, spicy astringent pungent foods. The text also states that the yoga student should avoid fasting, early morning baths, sexual intercourse, and sitting near fire. Milk and ghee (<b>clarified</b> <b>butter),</b> cooked wheat, green gram and rice are foods the text approves of, in verses 46–49. The Upanishad also recommends massage, particularly areas of body that tremor or profusely perspire during the practice of yoga.|$|E
5|$|Land {{ownership}} was important. Most of {{the growers}} were tenant farmers and {{were given the}} right of part ownership of the land over time. Tax policies encouraging needed produce made distinctions between land use to determine tax levies. For example, the daily market availability of rose petals was important for perfumers, so cultivation of roses received a lower tax assessment. Salt production and the manufacture of salt pans were controlled by similar means. The making of ghee (<b>clarified</b> <b>butter),</b> which was sold as an oil for human consumption and as a fuel for lighting lamps, was profitable. Exports to China intensified and included cotton, spices, jewels, semi-precious stones, ivory, rhino horn, ebony, amber, coral, and aromatic products such as perfumes. Large vessels from China made frequent visits, some captained by the Chinese Admiral Zheng He, and brought Chinese products to the empire's 300 ports, large and small, on the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. The ports of Mangalore, Honavar, Bhatkal, Barkur, Cochin, Cannanore, Machilipatnam, and Dharmadam were the most important.|$|E

25|$|<b>Clarified</b> <b>butter</b> is {{butter with}} {{almost all of}} its water and milk solids removed, leaving almost-pure butterfat. <b>Clarified</b> <b>butter</b> is made by heating butter to its melting point and then {{allowing}} it to cool; after settling, the remaining components separate by density. At the top, whey proteins form a skin, which is removed. The resulting butterfat is then poured off from the mixture of water and casein proteins that settle to the bottom.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{had to be}} {{processed}} to preserve it. This was done by first churning it, using a goatskin or clay container to separate the butterfat from the whey. The butterfat was processed by boiling and then cooling it to make <b>clarified</b> <b>butter,</b> which could then be stored for a long time. <b>Clarified</b> <b>butter</b> was used principally for cooking and frying. Butter churns have been excavated at Beersheba, dating from the 4th century BCE, and other ancient Israelite sites.|$|E

Food is served on big brass thali (plates) and drinks - water, lassi, milk (of several varieties), or tea, as well as shorbas (soups) - are served in a 12-inch-long brass glass. Two types of food are served in the Punjabi Dhabas - the Non Vegetarian cuisine, {{which is the most}} popular, and the Vegetarian fare, which is termed Vaishno Dhabas where only vegetarian food is cooked in pure ghee or <b>clarified</b> white <b>butter.</b> Dal makhni, a shining blackish lentil named Urad or Mah is a popular dish in the vegetarian type of dhaba.|$|R
50|$|Preparation of {{homemade}} kajal begins with dipping a clean, white, thin muslin cloth, about {{four by four}} inches square, in sandalwood paste or the juice of Alstonia scholaris (Manjal karisilanganni), which is then dried in the shade. This dip and dry process is done all day long. After sunset, a wick {{is made out of}} the cloth, which is then used to light a mud lamp filled with castor oil. A brass vessel is kept over the lamp, leaving a little gap, just enough for the oxygen to aid the burning of the lamp. This is left burning overnight. In the morning, one or two drops of pure ghee (<b>clarified</b> cow's <b>butter)</b> or castor oil are added to the soot which now lines the brass vessel. It is then stored in a clean dry box.|$|R

40|$|Ghee (<b>clarified</b> butter; butterfat; <b>butter</b> oil, etc,) {{has been}} {{manufactured}} {{and used in}} India {{and some of the}} countries in the Middle East, from time immemorial. Vedic hymns of Indians written about 2000 to 3000 B. C. give frequent references to ghee as "Ghrat" used for diet and religious ceremonies. At present it is the most important dairy product of India from several aspects. Out of total estimated milk production of 690 million Mds. in India (a Maund being 80 lbs.) nearly 52 % is converted into ghee, which works out to be 76 % of the total manufactured milk products. In the monetary value of 293. 4 million pounds for milk and milk products; ghee contributes 100 million pounds, that is about one third of the total value and half {{of the value of the}} manufactured milk products.

The traditional 'Wiener Schnitzel' though is a cutlet of veal. Other examples of Viennese cuisine include Tafelspitz (very lean boiled beef), which is traditionally served with Geröstete Erdäpfel (boiled potatoes mashed with a fork and subsequently fried) and horseradish sauce, Apfelkren (a mixture of horseradish, cream and apple) and Schnittlauchsauce (a chives sauce made with mayonnaise and stale bread).|$|E
25|$|To make hollandaise sauce, {{the eggs}} yolks are {{separated}} {{and added to}} a butter base with small amounts of water, vinegar or lemon juice with pepper, heated together slowly over a double boiler. A stainless steel bowl over a sauce pan {{with a small amount}} of water may also be used. The water should not touch the bowl or boil, just simmer. The key to the recipe is to heat the ingredients without curdling the egg. Add the egg and liquid ingredients first and whisk together with a wire whisk until frothy. Add the egg and liquid froth to the double boiler of the simmering water and whisk quickly and continuously. The mixture will expand a few times. Remove from the heat source and begin adding warm, melted, <b>clarified</b> <b>butter</b> to the mixture. If the sauce cools too much the butter will begin to thicken. If this or separation begins to occur, a few drops of hot water can solve this issue.|$|E
25|$|Emperor Nripatunga Amoghavarsha I of 850 CE {{recognised}} {{that the}} Sanskrit style of Kannada literature was Margi (formal or written form of language) and Desi (folk or spoken form of language) style was popular {{and made his}} people aware of the strength and beauty of their native language Kannada. In 1112 CE, Jain poet Nayasena of Mulugunda, Dharwad district, in his Champu work Dharmamrita, a book on morals, warns writers from mixing Kannada with Sanskrit by comparing it with mixing of <b>clarified</b> <b>butter</b> and oil. He has written it using very limited Sanskrit words which fit with idiomatic Kannada. In 1235 CE, Jain poet Andayya, wrote Kabbigara Kava (Poet's Defender), also called Sobagina Suggi (Harvest of Beauty) or Madana-Vijaya and Kavana-Gella (Cupid's Conquest), a Champu work in pure Kannada using only indigenous (desya) Kannada words and the derived form of Sanskrit words – tadbhavas, without the admixture of Sanskrit words. He succeeded in his challenge and proved wrong those who had advocated {{that it was impossible}} to write a work in Kannada without using Sanskrit words. Andayya may be considered as a protector of Kannada poets who were ridiculed by Sanskrit advocates. Thus Kannada is the only Dravidian language which is not only capable of using only native Kannada words and grammar in its literature (like Tamil), but also use Sanskrit grammar and vocabulary (like Telugu, Malayalam, Tulu, etc.) The Champu style of literature of mixing poetry with prose owes its origins to the Kannada language which was later incorporated by poets into Sanskrit and other Indian languages.|$|E
25|$|This temple is {{one among}} the 51 Shakti peethas {{located on the}} Indian subcontinent and is a {{location}} where one of Sati's limbs, her right arm is considered to have fallen when grief-stricken and agitated Shiva was carrying her dead body round the world on his shoulders, and Vishnu had cut her body into pieces with his Sudarshana Chakra. The story behind this event is that King Prajapati Daksha, father of Sati (the first wife of Lord Shiva), was performing a yagna (yagna {{is defined as a}} Hindu fire ritual sacrifice when deities of the Vedic times like Agni, the fire god, and others were invoked by offering oblations such as ghee (<b>clarified</b> <b>butter),</b> milk, grains and so forth) called as Brihaspatirao. Sati (also called Shakti) who was Lord Shiva's wife, attended the function without invitation. Daksha who was not fond of his son-in-law, as he considered him a mendicant, purposely did not invite him for the yagna, while he invited all other gods. Sati felt deeply insulted by the slight shown by her father towards her husband whom she had married out of deep love. Even then she decided to attend the yagna uninvited by her own father. When she went there, her father compounded the insult by totally ignoring her presence and vilifying Shiva. Sati felt deeply humiliated and hurt, and then in frustration she jumped into the yagna fire and committed suicide. When this news was conveyed to Shiva, first he sent his assistant to the site to enquire and take revenge. Shiva also came to the yagna site and created a furor. In a state of grief and anger he put Sati's dead body on his shoulders and started wandering round the universe. Looking at this grave situation, Brahma and Vishnu decided to intervene and bring back Shiva to his normal self. It was then decided that Vishnu will follow behind Shiva, and with his Sudarsha Chakra cut Sati's dead body into pieces. Thus Vishnu cut her into 51 pieces (108 pieces are also mentioned in many Puranic texts) as Shiva traveled around the world and these fifty one body parts of Sati fell at different locations in the subcontinent, and all these places {{came to be known as}} Shakthi Peethas (abode of goddess Shakthi or Durga). Her right arm fell on the Saptashrungi hills and the place became holy, and a Shakthi Peeth came to be established here.|$|E

Cow's milk and its derivatives such as ghee (<b>clarified</b> <b>butter)</b> are integral parts of Vedic fire sacrifices, which are conducted by Brahmin priests; thus the ancient Kamadhenu is sometimes also referred to the Homadhenu—the cow from whom oblations are drawn. Moreover, the cow also offers the Brahmin—who is prohibited to fight—protection against abusive kings who try to harm them. As a goddess, she becomes a warrior, creating armies to protect her master and herself.|$|E
