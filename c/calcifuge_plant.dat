40|$|Preliminary {{results are}} {{presented}} of sampling the leafhopper assemblages on a field experiment designed to examine the differential effects of rabbits and livestock (mainly sheep) on the vegetation of chalk heath in southern England. Experimental plots that excluded livestock either allowed entry by rabbits or excluded them. Results were compared with those from plots grazed by both livestock and rabbits. After 7 years, exclusion of grazing herbivores had resulted in predictable increases in vegetation height, but no major changes were detected in the species composition of the vegetation. As expected, ungrazed plots had higher species richness and greater abundances of several individual leafhopper species. However, plots grazed only by rabbits had a leafhopper assemblage that was distinct from either ungrazed or mixed grazing plots. It is suggested that rabbit grazing may have subtle effects on grassland invertebrate assemblages that are not necessarily predictable from {{an examination of the}} species composition of the vegetation. Chalk heath vegetation contains an unusual mixture of calcicole and <b>calcifuge</b> <b>plant</b> species, but the leafhopper assemblage included a restricted number of calcareous grassland specialist species and only one species strongly associated with acidic grasslands; most leafhoppers recorded were generalist grassland species...|$|E
40|$|Chlorosis in crops {{grown on}} {{calcareous}} soil is mainly due to iron (Fe) deficiency {{and can be}} alleviated by leaf application of soluble Fe 2 + or diluted acids. Whether chlorosis in indigenous plants forced to grow on a calcareous soil is also caused by Fe deficiency has, however, not been demonstrated. Veronica officinalis, a widespread <b>calcifuge</b> <b>plant</b> in Central and Northern Europe, was cultivated in two experiments on acid and calcareous soils. As phosphorus (P) deficiency {{is one of the}} major causes of the inability of many calcifuges to grow on calcareous soil we added phosphate to half of the soils. Leaves in pots with the unfertilized and the P-fertilized soil, respectively, were either sprayed with FeSO 4 solution or left unsprayed. Total Fe, P, and manganese (Mn) in leaves and roots and N remaining in the soil after the experiment were determined. In a second experiment, no P was added. Leaves were either sprayed with FeSO 4 or with H 2 SO 4 of the same pH as the FeSO 4 solution. Degree of chlorosis and Fe content in leaves were determined...|$|E
50|$|Observation of {{predominant}} flora. <b>Calcifuge</b> <b>plants</b> (those that prefer an acidic soil) include Erica, Rhododendron {{and nearly}} all other Ericaceae species, many birch (Betula), foxglove (Digitalis), gorse (Ulex spp.), and Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris). Calcicole (lime loving) plants include ash trees (Fraxinus spp.), honeysuckle (Lonicera), Buddleja, dogwoods (Cornus spp.), lilac (Syringa) and Clematis species.|$|R
50|$|However, a plant may be {{intolerant}} {{of a particular}} pH in some soils {{as a result of}} a particular mechanism, and that mechanism may not apply in other soils. For example, a soil low in molybdenum may not be suitable for soybean plants at pH 5.5, but soils with sufficient molybdenum allow optimal growth at that pH. Similarly, some <b>calcifuges</b> (<b>plants</b> {{intolerant of}} high-pH soils) can tolerate calcareous soils if sufficient phosphorus is supplied. Another confounding factor is that different varieties of the same species often have different suitable soil pH ranges. Plant breeders can use this to breed varieties that can tolerate conditions that are otherwise considered unsuitable for that species - examples are projects to breed aluminium-tolerant and manganese-tolerant varieties of cereal crops for food production in strongly acidic soils.|$|R

40|$|Background {{and aims}} Natural and semi-natural, non-fertilized {{calcareous}} soils are consistently low in soluble and easily exchangeable phosphate. An over-utilization, or possibly an immobilization, of inorganic P in the tissues of <b>calcifuge</b> <b>plants</b> may take place, if such plants {{are forced to}} grow on a calcareous soil, though {{this has not been}} experimentally demonstrated. The objectives of this study are, therefore, to elucidate if <b>calcifuge</b> <b>plants,</b> when forced to develop on a calcareous soil, not only have lower total P (Ptot) concentrations in their leaves than calcicole plants grown on such soil, but also a lower proportion of Not as water-soluble, inorganic phosphate. Such differences may be of importance in understanding the calcicole-calcifuge behaviour of plants. Materials and methods Plants of five calcicole and five calcifuge herbs and three calcicole and three calcifuge grasses were cultivated in a glasshouse on a moderately acid Cambisol and a calcareous Rendzic Leptosol using seeds of wild populations from southern Sweden. The calcifuges were: Corynephorus canescens, Deschampsia flexuosa, Holcus mollis, Digitalis purpurea, Lychnis viscaria, Rumex acetosella, Scleranthus annus and Silene rupestris. The calcicoles were: Melica ciliata, Phleum phleoides, Sesleria caerulea, Arabis hirsuta, Sanguisorba minor, Scabiosa columbaria, Silene uniflora ssp. petraea and Veronica spicata. Key results At harvest, calcifuges had much lower leaf tissue concentrations of Ptot and Pi than calcicoles when grown on the calcareous soil, and biomass production of the calcifuges was poor on this soil. Moreover, the calcifuge herbs had, on average, a lower proportion of their Ptot as Pi than had the calcicole herbs. The calcifuge herbs were also unable to avoid excessive uptake of Ca from the calcareous soil. The calcifuge grasses maintained a similar proportion of Ptot as Pi as the calcicole grasses, but their growth was still poor on the calcareous soil. Conclusions On calcareous soil, very little Pi in the tissues of calcifuge herbs is, at any time, available for use in various physiological functions. This is of importance to their photosynthesis, growth, competition and final survival on such soils...|$|R
40|$|Many {{vascular}} plant species {{are unable to}} colonize calcareous sites. Thus, the floristic composition of adjacent limestone and acid silicate soils differs greatly. The inability of <b>calcifuge</b> <b>plants</b> to establish in limestone sites seems related to a low capacity of such plants to solubilize and absorb Fe or phosphate from these soils. Until now, mechanisms regulating this differing ability of plants to colonize limestone sites have not been elucidated. We propose that contrasting exudation of low-molecular organic acids is a major mechanism involved and show that germinating seeds and young seedlings of limestone plants exude considerably more di- and tricarboxylic acids than calcifuges, which mainly exude monocarboxylic acids. The tricarboxylic citric acid is a powerful extractor of Fe, and the dicarboxylic oxalic acid a very effective extractor of phosphate from limestone soils. Monocarboxylic acids are very weak in these respects. The study is based on ten species from limestone soils and ten species from acid silicate soils...|$|R
40|$|One {{third of}} the earthÂ´s soils is calcareous. <b>Calcifuge</b> <b>plants</b> are {{excluded}} from these soils, {{and one of the}} main causes is Fe deficiency, as Fe solubility in calcareous soil is very low. A lack of Fe lowers chlorophyll content, visible as yellowing of leaves, called chlorosis. It is demonstrated that the main cause of chlorosis in calcifuges is that {{a large part of the}} Fe in their leaf tissues is immobilized in a form that is not metabolically 'active', which is not the case in calcicole plants adapted to growth on such soils. The Fe fraction in leaves responsible for chlorophyll synthesis may be Fe 2 + and can be extracted by synthetical chelators. 1, 10 -phenanthroline extractable Fe correlates well with degree of chlorosis. An additional cause of chlorosis in some calcifuges is a decreased Fe uptake by the root. Phosphorus concentration in the leaf tissue does not seem to have an influence on metabolically 'active' Fe, though phosphate addition to the soil may aggravate chlorosis. Studied were also other conditions of possible importance to calcicole-calcifuge behaviour, such as differences among plants in compartmentation of Fe between shoots, roots and the soil/root interface, as well as allocation of Fe and other plants nutrients to plant seeds. Iron immobilization in the tissue is ecologically important to the calcicole-calcifuge behaviour of plants, as it might decrease vitality in calcifuges and exclude them from calcareous soil...|$|R
40|$|Deficiency of P and {{sometimes}} of micronutrients; especially Fe, is {{of importance to}} the calcicole-calcifuge behaviour of <b>plants.</b> <b>Calcifuge</b> species are unable to solubilize these elements or keep them metabolically active in sufficient amounts on calcareous soils. To demonstrate if calcicole, calcifuge and 'soil indifferent' species differ in Fe nutrition dynamics, samples of such species were transplanted on a slightly acid silicate soil (pH BaCl 2 ca 4. 0) and on a calcareous soil (pH BaCl 2 ca 7. 2). Plants were grown in a computer-controlled greenhouse at a soil moisture content of 50 - 60 % water holding capacity and with additional light (ca 160 mu E s(- 1) m(- 2), 12 h d(- 1)) if ambient light was < 120 mu E s(- 1) m(- 2). The calcifuge species developed chlorosis when grown on the calcareous soil, whereas the other species did not. Calcareous-soil grown plants had less 1, 10 -phenanthroline extractable Fe in their leaf tissues than the silicate-grown plants whereas total leaf Fe showed more species specific properties. The ratio of 1; 10 -phenanthroline extractable to total Fe in the leaves was significantly lower in the calcifuges than in the calcicoles when grown on the calcareous soil. 'Soil indifferent' species did not differ much from the calcicoles. Root Fe, fractioned as DCB extractable 'plaque' on the root surface and Fe remaining in the root after DCB extraction, showed no distinct pattern of DCB-Fe related to the different categories, but remaining root Fe tended to be lower in the calcifuges compared to the two other categories. Leaf colour estimated by a colour scale correlated well with chlorophyll a + b content measured in the leaves of two calcifuges. Leaf P concentrations did not differ between the different categories but were more species dependent. We conclude that chlorosis in calcifuge species is related to an immobilization of Fe in physiologically less active forms in the tissue, if plants are forced to grow on a calcareous soil, whereas calcicole and 'soil indifferent' species are able to retain a much higher share of their leaf Fe in metabolically active form. This probably decreases the vitality and may exclude <b>calcifuge</b> <b>plants</b> from calcareous soil. We consider this property, previously almost unconsidered in an ecological context, {{as important to the}} calcifuge-calcicole behaviour of plants...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>calcifuge</b> is a <b>plant</b> {{that does}} not {{tolerate}} alkaline (basic) soil. [...] The word {{is derived from the}} Latin 'to flee from chalk'. These plants are also described as ericaceous, as the prototypical calcifuge is the genus Erica (heaths). It is not the presence of carbonate or hydroxide ions per se that these plants cannot tolerate, but the fact that under alkaline conditions, iron becomes less soluble. Consequently, calcifuges grown on alkaline soils often develop the symptoms of iron deficiency, i.e. interveinal chlorosis of new growth. There are many horticultural <b>plants</b> which are <b>calcifuges,</b> most of which require an 'ericaceous' compost with a low pH, composed principally of Sphagnum moss peat.|$|R

Em cada tipo de mata foram coletadas todas as folhas de 15 indivÃ­duos jovens, sendo cinco por classe de altura (5 - 50, 50 - 100, e 100 - 150 cm). As folhas foram separadas em trÃªs categorias: novas, maduras e senescentes e depois foram secas e analisados para os seguintes elementos: P, K, Ca, Mg e Al. A concentraÃ§Ã£o dos nutrientes nas folhas nÃ£o diferiu em relaÃ§Ã£o ao tamanho dos indivÃ­duos. Apenas o alumÃ­nio apresentou menores teores nos indivÃ­duos de 5 - 50 cm.

Metrodorea pubescens is an {{abundant}} {{tree in the}} forests of the Distrito Federal, occurring in mesophytic forests (on calcareous soils) and in gallery forests (acidic soils). In both forest types all leaves from 15 small individuals from five individuals in each of three height classes (5 - 50, 50 - 100, 100 - 150 cm) were collected. The leaves were separated in three categories; new, mature and senescent, and then dried and analyzed for the following elements: P, K, Ca, Mg and Al. The concetration of nutrientes in the leaves was similar in all height classes, except for al which showed lower concentration in the smallest individuals (5 - 50 cm). New leaves showed higher concentration of P and K. On the other hand Ca, Mg and Al {{were higher in the}} mature leaves. The concentration of P decreased from mature leaves to senescent leaves. The plants from calcareous soil showed higher concentration of Ca and lower concentration of K than plants of acidic soil. The values of P, Mg and Al were similar in both forests. The differences between populations could possibly be explained by soil type, but other factors such as the physiological behavior of plants should also be considered.

40|$|Many {{vascular}} plant species {{are unable to}} colonise calcareous sites, the floristic composition of adjacent limestone and acid silicate soils differing markedly. The inability of these 'calcifuge' species to establish themselves and grow on limestone soil appears to mainly be related to their low capacity for solubilising and absorbing phosphate and/or iron from such soils. Differences between calcifuge and calcicole species (the latter normally growing on calcareous soil) in their root exudation of low-molecular organic acids (LOAs) can lead {{to their ability to}} solubilise mineral nutrients from the soil differing. In the studies presented in this thesis I examined exudation by many calcicole and calcifuge species. Exudation was studied for plants grown hydroponically, for germinating seeds and seedlings and for plants grown in a pH intermediate soil. I found that calcicole species generally have a higher, often much higher, exudation rate of dicarboxylic oxalate and tricarboxylic citrate than calcifuge species do. These two LOAs were also shown to have a strong solubilising effect on soil phosphate and iron, both in calcareous and silicate soil. I also studied the calcifuge behaviour of Rumex acetosella in greater detail. R. acetosella was found to be a highly phosphate-limited species, its growth being closely correlated to the amount of easily exchangeable phosphate in the soil. This species, which contain large amounts of oxalate in its leaves, appears in any case to lack the ability to increase the exudation rate of LOAs in response to phosphate limitation. In my thesis I propose that high exudation rates of dicarboxylic and tricarboxylic organic acids is one of the mechanisms explaining <b>calcifuge</b> behaviour in <b>plants.</b> I also propose that high root exudation rates of LOAs from plants can be an adaptation to nutrient limiting conditions in soils...|$|R
40|$|Similarity and {{difference}} between Phyteuma nigrum and P. spicatum in the Netherlands {{have been investigated}} from morphological, geographical and ecological viewpoints. Data have been collected in lowland areas only (less than 50 m above sea-level). As to the morphology, 96 basal leaves from 10 populations of P. nigrum and 85 basal leaves from 9 populations of P. spicatum were sampled. (The term âleavesâ in the next sentences refers to these basal leaves only.) On the average, leaves of P. nigrum have a lower breadth/length quotient than those of P. nigrum, {{but there is a}} considerable overlap. Also, the leaf base of P. nigrum tends to be slightly less deeply cordate than that of P. spicatum, and truncate leaves were more frequent in the first-named taxon. But the average âcordatenessâ ratios only show a small difference and a paramount overlap. Even if both features together are plotted for the investigated populations, 4 P. nigrum and 3 P. spicatum populations appear to be within the overlap range (fig. 2 - 5). Leaves of P. nigrum are normally crenate, those of P. spicatum are more often serrate than crenate. Incision is most often unequal â neither wholly simple nor distinctly double â in P. nigrum, while in P. spicatum doubly-serrate leaves are most common. However, none of these characteristics allows a sharp delimitation either (table 1). The corolla colour {{turns out to be the}} only feature completely distinctive between P. nigrum and P. spicatum. From their geographical distribution it may be concluded that P. nigrum has arrived in the Netherlands later than P. spicatum (but certainly long enough ago to call it a native species). Although reaching here its NW distribution limit, the former is less rare than the latter, which extends further to the N and W. Often P. nigrum is considered a <b>calcifuge</b> mountain <b>plant,</b> but in the NW of its area neither qualification is correct. The few scattered localities of P. spicatum are situated in gaps in the distribution pattern of P. nigrum, with the exception of one station in Drenthe (fig. 6). In the investigated area, both P. nigrum and P. spicatum are most often found in woodland, especially along brooks. Their ecological (dis) similarity has been investigated by means of vegetation analysis. The majority of accompanying species occur together with both P. nigrum and P. spicatum, and none of the differences in presence degree appeared to be significant (table 2). An ordination diagram (fig. 10) revealed one point of difference, however. While P. nigrum is repeatedly met within predominantly grassy vegetation types, only two such stations of P. spicatum exist. It is concluded that of the two taxa, P. nigrum is better adapted to human interference. Where both species occur together, they hybridize readily. In the Netherlands, P. spicatum may have 'eclipsed' after the arrival of P. nigrum, surviving only in some areas where the latter taxon did not penetrate. As to the exceptional locality in Drenthe, where both taxa occur together, it is argued that at the beginning of the 20 th century it was a piece of woodland containing only P. spicatum, and that after its conversion into grassland P. nigrum immigrated. In course of time P. spicatum might vanish by introgressive hybridization. Because the corolla colour is the only consistently distinctive feature, it is suggested that the rank of subspecies is more appropriate to P. nigrum and P. spicatum than that of separate species. Therefore, for P. nigrum a new combination is introduced: Phyteuma spicatum L. subsp. nigrum (F. W. Schmidt) Weeda, comb. nov...|$|R
