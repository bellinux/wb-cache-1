500|$|Rowe's {{illness and}} Blanchflower's arrival {{together}} signalled {{the end of}} Ramsey's playing career. Ramsey missed matches during the 1954–55 season through injury, and in April 1955 suffered what he called [...] "a terrible roasting" [...] {{at the hands of}} the Leicester City winger Derek Hogg. After Tottenham ended the season in 16th place, Rowe retired permanently; his deputy Jimmy Anderson took over and appointed Nicholson to his coaching staff. When Ramsey was omitted from a post-season tour of Hungary, despite still being club captain, he realised that his time at Tottenham had come to an end. He had played a total of 250 competitive games for Tottenham in all competitions, across six seasons. [...] "I was 35 years old and obviously <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> future," [...] he later wrote. [...] "I really didn't know what was going to happen to me. I knew my days as a player were numbered, and there was only one way things could go for me in this respect—downhill." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Marc Cherry {{was in a}} {{precarious}} financial situation and was having trouble finding a job. He commented, [...] "I was broke, unable to get even an interview for a writing job, and seriously <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> future. I had just turned forty and was starting to wonder if I {{was one of those}} deluded writers that wander around Hollywood, convincing themselves they're talented when all the evidence points to the contrary." [...] While watching television coverage of the Andrea Yates trials with his mother, Cherry turned to her and asked, [...] "Can you imagine being so desperate that you would do that to your children?" [...] to which his mother replied, [...] "I've been there." [...] Cherry was intrigued by the idea that a [...] "perfectly sane, rational woman could have the life she wanted, being a wife and mother... and still have moments of insanity;" [...] he began writing the pilot episode soon after. Cherry originally developed the concept as a half-hour comedy. However, after his agent was arrested for embezzlement, Cherry signed with Paradigm Talent Agency, where he was advised to rewrite the script as a soap opera. Cherry completed the first draft of the pilot in April 2002 and pitched the script to CBS, NBC, Fox, HBO, Showtime, and Lifetime, all of which turned it down.|$|E
2500|$|Soros {{has been}} accused of saying that both Jews and Israel are {{partially}} responsible for antisemitism, in response to his statement that the administrations of G.W. Bush in the U.S. and Ariel Sharon in Israel were stoking antisemitism. He has also said that Jews can't overcome antisemitism without [...] "giv up on the tribalness." [...] On November 5, 2003, at a Jewish forum in New York City, Soros partially attributed a recent resurgence of antisemitism to the policies of Israel and the United States, and the role of wealthy and influential individuals:There is a resurgence of anti-Semitism in Europe. The policies of the Bush administration and the Sharon administration contribute to that. It's not specifically anti-Semitism, but it does manifest itself in anti-Semitism as well. I'm critical of those policies... If we change that direction, then anti-Semitism also will diminish. I can't see how one could confront it directly... I'm also very <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own role because the new anti-Semitism holds that the Jews rule the world... As an unintended consequence of my actions... I also contribute to that image.|$|E

2500|$|Kasparov {{spoke out}} several times about Putin's antigay {{laws and the}} {{proposed}} Sochi Olympics boycott. He explained in August 2013 that he had opposed Russia’s bid from the outset, since hosting the Olympics would [...] "allow Vladimir Putin’s cronies to embezzle {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars" [...] and [...] "lend prestige to Putin’s authoritarian regime." [...] Kasparov added that Putin's anti-gay law was [...] "only the most recent encroachment on the freedom of speech and association of Russia’s citizens," [...] which the international community had largely ignored. Instead of supporting a games boycott, which would [...] "unfairly punish athletes," [...] Kasparov called for athletes and others to [...] "transform Putin’s self-congratulatory pet project into a spotlight that exposes his authoritarian rule for the entire world to see." [...] In September, Kasparov expanded on his remarks, saying that [...] "forcing athletes to play a political role against their will is not fair" [...] and that politicians should not [...] "hide behind athletes." [...] Instead of boycotting Sochi, he suggested, politicians should refuse to attend the games and the public should [...] "put pressure on the sponsors and the media." [...] Coca-Cola, for example, could put [...] "a rainbow flag on each Coca-Cola can" [...] and NBC could [...] "do interviews with Russian gay activists or with Russian political activists." [...] Kasparov also emphasized that although he was [...] "still a Russian citizen," [...] he had [...] "good reason to be <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> ability to leave Russia if I returned to Moscow." ...|$|E

6000|$|But if this {{publication}} {{be only a}} more solemn funeral of my remains, I desire it may be known that I die in charity, and in my senses, without any murmurs against the justice of this age, or any mad appeals to posterity. I declare I shall think {{the world in the}} right, and quietly submit to every truth which time shall discover to the prejudice of these writings; not so much as wishing so irrational a thing as that every body should be deceived merely for my credit. However, I desire it may then be considered, that there are very few things in this collection which were not written under the age of five-and-twenty, so that my youth may be made, as it never fails to be in executions, a case of compassion; that I was never so <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> works as to vindicate them in print, believing if any thing was good it would defend itself, and what was bad could never be defended; that I used no artifice to raise or continue a reputation, depreciated no dead author I was obliged to, bribed no living one with unjust praise, insulted no adversary with ill language,[22] or, when I could not attack a rival's works, encouraged reports against his morals. To conclude, if this volume perish, let it serve as a warning to the critics not to take too much pains for the future to destroy such things as will die of themselves; and a memento mori to some of my vain contemporaries the poets, to teach them that when real merit is wanting, it avails nothing to have been encouraged by the great, commended by the eminent, and favoured by the public in general.[23] ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: My {{response}} to Witmer comes in three sections: In the first I address <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> book's blindsight thought-experiment, remarking {{specifically on the}} role imagination plays in it, and my grounds for thinking (in the face of Witmer's doubts) that a first-person approach is valuable here. In Section Two I consider {{the relation of the}} thought-experiment to theses regarding possibility and necessity, and Witmer's discussion of ways of arguing for the impossibility of "Belinda-style " blindsight, despite its apparent conceivability. Finally, in Section Three, I consider Witmer's suggestion that we build on my discussion of blindsight to support the thesis that consciousness is a hidden physical feature. 1. Why a First-Person Approach? I am grateful to Gene Witmer for his detailed and scrupulous remarks on The Significance of Consciousness (Siewert, 1998). (All pages references will be to this book.)

6000|$|A {{matter of}} missionaries {{commonly}} {{is to the}} fore {{as a cause of}} quarrel among nations which have the hardihood to prefer their own religions to ours. Missionaries constitute, in truth, a perpetual menace to the national peace. I dare say the most of them are conscientious men and women of a certain order of intellect. They believe, and from the way that they interpret their sacred book have some reason to believe, that in meddling uninvited with the spiritual affairs of others they perform a work acceptable to God--their God. They think they discern a moral difference between [...] "approaching" [...] a man of another religion about the state of his soul and approaching him on the condition of his linen or the character of his wife. I think there is no difference. I have observed that the person who volunteers an interest in my spiritual welfare is the same person from whom I must expect an impudent <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> temporal affairs. The missionary is one who goes about throwing open the shutters of other men's bosoms in order to project upon the blank walls a shadow of himself.|$|R
