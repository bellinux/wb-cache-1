5|$|Benign conditions, {{sometimes}} {{also referred}} to as <b>confined</b> <b>water,</b> are environments of low risk, where it is extremely unlikely or impossible for the diver to get lost or entrapped, or be exposed to hazards other than the basic underwater environment. These conditions are suitable for initial training in the critical survival skills, and include swimming pools, training tanks, aquarium tanks and some shallow and protected shoreline areas.|$|E
25|$|Recreational diver {{training}} courses range from minor specialties which require one classroom session {{and an open}} water dive, and which may be completed in a day, to complex specialties which may take several days to weeks, and require several classroom sessions, <b>confined</b> <b>water</b> skills training and practice, and {{a substantial number of}} open-water dives, followed by rigorous assessment of knowledge and skills. Details on the approximate duration of training {{can be found on the}} websites of most certification agencies, but accurate schedules are generally only available from the specific school or instructor who will present that course, as this will depend on the local conditions and other constraints.|$|E

6000|$|For {{some time}} {{previous}} {{the men had}} been {{at work on a}} lode which was very promising, but they were compelled to cease following it, because it approached the workings of an old part of the mine which was known to be full of water. To tap this old part, or as the miners expressed it, to [...] "hole into this house of water," [...] was, they were well aware, an exceedingly dangerous operation. The part of the mine to which we allude was not under the sea, but back a little from the shore, and was not very deep at that time. The [...] "adit"--or water-conducting--level by which the spot was reached commenced at the cliffs, on a level with the seashore, and ran into the interior until it reached the old mine, {{about a quarter of a}} mile inland. Here was situated the [...] "house," [...] which was neither more nor less than a number of old shafts and levels filled with water. As they had approached the old mine its near proximity was made disagreeably evident by the quantity of moisture that oozed through the crevices in the rocks--moisture which ere long took the form of a number of tiny rills--and at last began to spirt out from roof and sides in such a way that the miners became alarmed, and hesitated to continue to work in a place where they ran the most imminent risk of being suddenly drowned and swept into the sea, by the bursting of the rocks that still withstood the immense pressure of the <b>confined</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
