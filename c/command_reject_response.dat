Although the preference orders derived from the two response modes were identical, the pick data contained a greater number of inconsistencies than the reject data.

An experiment performed as a test of these predictions supported the unfolding model suggesting that differences in inconsistency between response modes could be attributed to the fineness of the grid of working midpoints imposed upon the choice process by the response mode...|$|R

40|$|Building on {{self-determination}} theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000), {{the current}} study addressed the role of maternal empathy in predicting adolescents’ depressive symptoms, through maternal psychological control. Less empathic mothers may be less sensitive to adolescents’ need for psychological autonomy, and thus prone to violating this need using psychological control, which may in turn predict adolescents’ depressive symptoms. Moreover, according to interpersonal theory of depression (Coyne, 1976), adolescents’ depressive symptoms may elicit <b>rejecting</b> <b>responses,</b> such as mothers’ psychological control. For six waves, 497 adolescents (57 % boys, Mage T 1 = 13. 03) annually completed questionnaires on depressive symptoms and maternal psychological control, while mothers reported on their empathy. Cross-lagged path analyses showed that throughout adolescence, mothers’ empathy indirectly predicted boys’ and girls’ depressive symptoms, through psychological control. Additionally, depressive symptoms predicted psychological control for boys, and early adolescent girls. These results highlight the importance of (1) mothers’ empathy in predicting adolescents’ depressive symptoms, and (2) taking gender into account when examining adolescent-effects...|$|R

The paper assesses and rejects claims that income is satisfactorily correlated with well-being, and addresses {{the implications of}} discrepancies between income measures and measures of subjective well-being (SWB) and objective well-being (OWB) and also between subjective and objective well-being measures themselves. It discusses a range of possible responses to the discrepancies: for example, examination of the specifications used for income, SWB and OWB, and looking for other causal factors and at their possible competitive relations with economic inputs to well-being. It <b>rejects</b> <b>responses</b> that ignore the discrepancies or drastically downgrade their significance by adopting a well-being conception that ignores both SWB and OWB arguments (e. g. : by a claim that all that matters is choice or being active).

An additional offer of some Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar transports which had previously seen service with the VNAF was equally turned down by the Cambodians.
