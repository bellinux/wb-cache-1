5|$|Women {{may have}} acute {{low back pain}} from medical {{conditions}} affecting the female reproductive system, including endometriosis, ovarian cysts, ovarian <b>cancer,</b> <b>or</b> uterine fibroids. Nearly half of all pregnant women report pain in the lower back or sacral area during pregnancy, due to changes in their posture and center of gravity causing muscle and ligament strain.|$|E
5|$|Cervical {{stenosis}} {{refers to}} an abnormally narrow cervical canal, typically associated with trauma caused by removal of tissue for investigation or treatment of <b>cancer,</b> <b>or</b> cervical cancer itself. Diethylstilbestrol, used from 1938 to 1971 to prevent preterm labour and miscarriage, is also strongly associated {{with the development of}} cervical stenosis and other abnormalities in the daughters of the exposed women. Other abnormalities include: vaginal adenosis, in which the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix becomes columnar; cancers such as clear cell adenocarcinomas; cervical ridges and hoods; and development of a cockscomb cervix appearance.|$|E
5|$|Hepatitis C is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver <b>cancer,</b> <b>or</b> dilated {{blood vessels in the}} esophagus and stomach.|$|E
50|$|Several {{factors are}} {{important}} when reviewing reports for individual breast <b>cancers</b> <b>or</b> when reading the medical literature, and applying staging data.|$|R
5000|$|Cystic lymphangiomas or {{lymph nodes}} with hypodense centers, which mimic necrotizing lymphomas, ovarian <b>or</b> renal <b>cancers,</b> <b>or</b> other {{malignancies}} {{can occur in}} the retroperitoneum, pelvis or mediastinum.|$|R
50|$|Genes {{related to}} cytokines, which {{influence}} inflammation and immune responses. These genes could influence successful aging by regulating cellular senescence, determining susceptibility to age-related <b>cancers,</b> <b>or</b> other mechanisms.|$|R
5|$|In {{those who}} are {{otherwise}} healthy, {{there is little evidence}} that supplements have any benefits with respect to <b>cancer</b> <b>or</b> heart disease. Vitamin A and E supplements not only provide no health benefits for generally healthy individuals, but they may increase mortality, though the two large studies that support this conclusion included smokers for whom it was already known that beta-carotene supplements can be harmful. While other findings suggest that vitamin E toxicity is limited to only a specific form when taken in excess.|$|E
5|$|The high {{incidence}} of breast lumps among Adivasi women of Adilabad in Telangana has created apprehension of more serious health impacts for this remote population.“Leave alone breast <b>cancer</b> <b>or</b> {{any other type of}} carcinoma, even routine mammarian infections were unknown among indigenous people belonging to the Gond, Pardhan, Kolam and Thotti,” points out Dr. Thodsam Chandu, the District Immunisation Officer, himself a Gond.|$|E
5|$|The {{tumor marker}} CA-125 is {{frequently}} elevated in endometrial cancer {{and can be}} used to monitor response to treatment, particularly in serous cell <b>cancer</b> <b>or</b> advanced disease. Periodic MRIs or CT scans may be recommended in advanced disease and women with a history of endometrial cancer should receive more frequent pelvic examinations for the five years following treatment. Examinations conducted every three to four months are recommended for the first two years following treatment, and every six months for the next three years.|$|E
40|$|Polycythaemia vera (PV) {{and primary}} myelofibrosis (MF) show {{concordant}} familial clustering but limited population level {{data are available}} on the aggregation of other discordant neoplasms in these families. We used the Swedish Family-Cancer Database to assess risks for VP and MF in families of cancer patients. A total of 3530 first PV and 1606 MF patients were identified, with high concordant familial risks. Several discordant familial associations were found for PV (acute myeloid leukaemia, Hodgkin disease, prostate and bladder <b>cancers)</b> <b>or</b> for MF (chronic lymphatic leukaemia, colorectal, kidney and cervical <b>cancers)</b> <b>or</b> for both (nervous system, eye and endocrine tumours) ...|$|R
30|$|In {{discussing}} {{biology of}} age-associated chronic diseases {{it is helpful}} to keep in mind the hypothesis that chronic inflammation differentially influences the tissues that are immune-responsive (e.g., epithelium, endothelium, vasculature, mucus secreting goblet cells, stroma) or immune-privileged (e.g., BBB, CNS, neuroretina, uterus, testis) in initiating multistep disease processes such as site-specific <b>cancers</b> <b>or</b> neurodegenerative or autoimmune diseases [8].|$|R
50|$|Scientific {{studies suggest}} that certain types of {{lactalbumin}} (whey protein) can significantly improve immune responsiveness and increase levels of glutathione systemically in animals and possesses antiviral (against viruses), anti-apoptotic (impede cell death) and anti-tumor (against <b>cancers</b> <b>or</b> tumors) activities in humans.|$|R
5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is {{uncommon in}} Salukis, with the breed ranking joint lowest {{in a survey}} by the British Veterinary Association in 2003. The breed scored an average of 5 points, with a score of 0 being low, while 106 is high. In a 2006 breed specific survey conducted by The Kennel Club and the British Small Animal Veterinary Association Scientific Committee, responses highlighted several health issues. The primary cause of death identified was that of cancer, being responsible for 35.6% of deaths, with the most common forms being that of liver <b>cancer</b> <b>or</b> lymphoma. The secondary cause of death was cardiac related, with forms such as heart failure, or unspecified heart defects. Old age is listed as the third most frequent cause of death.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} may be {{classified}} {{based on the}} signs and symptoms. Diffuse pain that does not change in response to particular movements, and is localized to the lower back without radiating beyond the buttocks, is classified as nonspecific, the most common classification. Pain that radiates down the leg below the knee, is located on one side (in the case of disc herniation), or is on both sides (in spinal stenosis), and changes in severity in response to certain positions or maneuvers is radicular, making up 7% of cases. Pain that is accompanied by red flags such as trauma, fever, a history of <b>cancer</b> <b>or</b> significant muscle weakness may indicate a more serious underlying problem and is classified as needing urgent or specialized attention.|$|E
25|$|Retroviruses are {{established}} pathogens of veterinary importance. They are generally {{a cause of}} <b>cancer</b> <b>or</b> immune deficiency.|$|E
50|$|Voriconazole is used {{to treat}} {{invasive}} aspergillosis and candidiasis and fungal infections caused by Scedosporium and Fusarium species, which may occur in immunocompromised patients, including people undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT), who have hematologic <b>cancers</b> <b>or</b> who undergo organ transplants.|$|R
25|$|If {{the patient}} {{does not respond}} to (or does not receive) HIV {{treatment}} they will succumb usually to either <b>cancers</b> <b>or</b> infections; the immune system finally reaches {{a point where it}} is no longer coordinated or stimulated enough to deal with the disease.|$|R

50|$|Screening {{either for}} {{specific}} <b>cancers</b> <b>or</b> generally for malignant growth. Broad screening for {{all or most}} types of cancer was early suggested but has since been shown {{not to be a}} realistic goal. Screening for specific <b>cancer</b> types <b>or</b> locations requires a level of specificity and sensitivity that for tumor markers has so far only been reached by PSA. Thymidine kinase neither reaches the clinical sensitivity nor the clinical specificity to be useful for screening purposes, see however Huang et al., Xiang et al. and Cao et al.|$|R
40|$|Electroporation allows {{efficient}} {{delivery of}} DNA into cells and tissues, thereby improving {{the expression of}} therapeutic or immunogenic proteins that are encoded by plasmid DNA. This simple and versatile method holds a great potential and could address unmet medical needs such as the prevention or treatment of many <b>cancers</b> <b>or</b> infectious diseases...|$|R
25|$|Treatment, {{typically}} surgery of some kind, {{is involved}} if polyposis {{has led to}} a large number of polyps, or a significant risk of <b>cancer,</b> <b>or</b> actual cancer.|$|E
25|$|Testicular {{cancer and}} other {{neoplasms}} To improve the chances of catching possible cases of testicular <b>cancer</b> <b>or</b> other health issues early, regular testicular self-examination is recommended.|$|E

2500|$|Samantha King {{says that}} {{prevention}} research is minimized by {{the breast cancer}} industry {{because there is no}} way to make money off of cases of breast cancer that do not happen, whereas a mammography imaging system that finds more possible <b>cancers,</b> <b>or</b> a [...] "magic bullet" [...] that kills confirmed cancers, would be highly profitable.|$|R
30|$|It is {{well known}} that {{surgical}} resection is the only curative treatment for DPC. No evidence-based chemotherapy regimens exist either for the treatment of unresectable <b>cancers</b> <b>or</b> for postoperative adjuvant therapy; therefore, we simply followed up the patient. Fortunately, the patient is doing well, without any signs of tumor recurrence since the last 5  years.|$|R

25|$|The {{risks are}} highest for {{children}} and teens, who have a longer lifetime for cells to develop <b>cancers</b> <b>or</b> errors due to exposure. Children have higher estimates of the lifetime risk for cancer incidence and mortality per unit dose of ionizing radiation. It is recommended that children or adolescents have no more exposure than medically necessary.|$|R
2500|$|Radiation {{may be used}} {{to treat}} stage II seminoma <b>cancers,</b> <b>or</b> as {{adjuvant}} (preventative) therapy in the case of stage I seminomas, to minimize the likelihood that tiny, non-detectable tumors exist and will spread (in the inguinal and para-aortic lymph nodes). [...] Radiation is ineffective against and is therefore never used as a primary therapy for nonseminoma.|$|R
