40|$|Achieving {{microbial}} compliance {{levels in}} biosolids storage {{is complicated by}} the unpredictable increase of Escherichia coli (E. coli), which serves as an important indicator for pathogen presence risk. Meeting required microbial specifications validates sludge treatment processes and ensures that a safe product is applied to agricultural land. Controlled indicator monitoring provides confidence for farmers, retailers and the food industry, safeguarding the sludge-to-land application route. Following mechanical dewatering biosolids products are stored before microbial compliance testing permits agricultural application. During storage, concentrations of E. coli bacteria can become elevated and prevent the product from meeting the conventional or enhanced levels of treatment outlined in The Safe Sludge Matrix guidelines. Literature research identified innate characteristics of sludge and ambient environmental parameters of storage which are factors likely to influence E. coli behaviour in stored biosolids. The research hypothesis tested whether E. coli growth and death in dewatered sewage sludge can be controlled by the modification of physical-chemical factors in the cake <b>storage</b> <b>environment.</b> Parameters including nutrient availability, temperature, moisture content and atmospheric influences were investigated through a series of laboratory-scale experiments. Controlled dewatering and the assessment of modified <b>storage</b> <b>environments</b> using traditional microbial plating and novel flow cytometry analysis have been performed. At an operational scale, pilot trials and up-scaled monitoring of the sludge <b>storage</b> <b>environment</b> have been conducted enabling verification of laboratory results. Understanding the dynamics of cell health within the sludge matrix in relation to nutrient availability has provided a valuable understanding of the mechanisms that may be affecting bacterial growth post-dewatering. The importance of elevated storage temperatures on E. coli death rates and results showing the benefits of a <b>controlled</b> atmosphere <b>storage</b> <b>environment</b> provide important considerations for utilities...|$|R

Syntometrine {{is an effective}} and commonly used oxytocic in preventing postpartum haemorrhage, but it requires a <b>controlled</b> <b>storage</b> <b>environment</b> and i. m. administration. Misoprostol is an orally active uterotonic agent. A total of 2058 patients having a singleton pregnancy, low risk for postpartum haemorrhage and vaginal delivery were randomized to receive either 1 ml syntometrine or 600 Î¼g misoprostol {{for the management of}} the third stage of labour. There {{were no significant differences between}} the two groups in the mean blood loss, the incidence of postpartum haemorrhage and the fall in haemoglobin concentration. The need for additional oxytocic injection was significantly higher in the misoprostol group [relative risk (RR) 1. 62, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 34 - 1. 96], but that of manual removal of placenta was reduced (RR 0. 29, 95 % CI 0. 09 - 0. 87). Shivering and transient pyrexia were more common in the misoprostol group. Oral misoprostol might be used in the management of the third stage, especially in situations where the use of syntometrine is contraindicated and facilities for storage and parenteral administration of oxytocics are limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This invited {{review and}} opinion piece, assesses {{the impact of}} climate change on mycotoxins in food: only one paper and an {{abstract}} referred directly from a substantial literature search and then only in relation to Europe. Climate change is an accepted probability by most scientists. Favourable temperature and water activity are crucial for mycotoxigenic fungi and mycotoxin production. Fungal diseases of crops provide relevant information for pre-harvest mycotoxin contamination. However, the mycotoxin issue also involves post-harvest scenarios. There are no data on how mycotoxins affect competing organisms in crop ecosystems. In general, if the temperature increases in cool or temperate climates, the relevant countries may become more liable to aflatoxins. Tropical countries may become too inhospitable for conventional fungal growth and mycotoxin production. Could this lead to the extinction of thermotolerant Aspergillus flavus? Currently cold regions may become liable to temperate problems concerning ochratoxin A, patulin and Fusarium toxins (e. g. deoxynivalenol). Regions which can afford to <b>control</b> the <b>environment</b> of <b>storage</b> facilities {{may be able to}} avoid post-harvest problems but at high additional cost. There appears to be a lack of awareness of the issue in some non-European countries. The era will provide numerous challenges for mycotoxicologists.
