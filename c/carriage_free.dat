When Nicholas began to describe Madeline, he sat with his mouth wide open, nudging Mrs Browdie from time to time, and exclaiming under his breath that she must be 'raa'ther a tidy sart,' and when he heard at last that his young friend had come down purposely to communicate his good fortune, and to convey to him all those assurances of friendship which he could not state with sufficient warmth in writing--that the only object of his journey was to share his happiness with them, and to tell them that when he was married they must come up to see him, and that Madeline insisted on it as well as he--John could hold out no longer, but after looking indignantly at his wife, and demanding to know what she was whimpering for, drew his coat sleeve over his eyes and blubbered outright.|$|E
40|$|Computing {{the loads}} for a train passing a tunnel {{requires}} to predict both the external {{and the internal}} pressure variations in time, {{both of which are}} strong and quick for a non-pressure tight train. The key achievement of this work has been the development of 3 D CFD Star-CCM+ overset mesh simulations capable of simulating the single train tunnel entry and tunnel passage as well as the two trains crossing inside the tunnel. Unfortunately it is not affordable to execute a 3 D CFD study for the tunnel passage of each new train model, so 1 D CFD codes have been employed, simplified predictive models have been developed and both have been compared to the 3 D CFD results. An important result has been identifying the influence of several parameters on the loads caused both by the travelling pressure waves generated when the train enters the tunnel and by the pressure disturbances due to train crossing inside the tunnel, using Star-CCM+ parameters sweeps simulations over train speed and train and tunnel geometrical parameters. The main conclusion is that the internal pressure variation is particularly important to compute the loads, especially for non-tight trains. For this reason it is necessary to take into account both the <b>carriage</b> <b>free</b> length and the position along the carriage on which the loads are needed...|$|E

40|$|Physical {{experiments}} were conducted using 3 D printed wheels and a sand testing bed {{to explore the}} applications and predictive power of the Resistive Force Theory (RFT), an empirical model based on linear superposition designed to predict the interactive forces between solid bodies and granular media. Four-spoke wheel designs, made of four treads with a hinge halfway down each tread set to a prescribed angle 0, and cylindrical wheels were used to validate a scaling law determined from RFT. The 3 D printed wheels were attached to an experimental test rig that consisted of a motor fixed to a <b>carriage</b> <b>free</b> to move horizontally and vertically. Data was gathered {{through a series of}} horizontal, vertical, and angular position sensors and a set of force and torque sensors, then processed with a MATLAB script and determined to validate the RFT scaling law. Next, the design of an actuated wheel capable of altering its shaped while in motion was explored. RFT predicts that as motion conditions of the wheel change, a corresponding change {{in the shape of the}} wheel would lead to an improvement in the wheel's performance. In order to properly analyze the effect of the change of shape of the wheel, the actuated wheel was designed to first only change shape in the in-plane dimension, and second be sufficiently rigid such that it does not exhibit excessive deformation in the new shape while under load. Several designs were explored, and the final form of the "FrankenWheel" is designed with a series of five flaps that rotate to fixed angles using a system of gears, hinges, and a secondary motor. This version of the "FrankenWheel" has been assembled for testing. by David Carrington Motley. Thesis: S. B., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, 2016.

40|$|This is a substudy of {{a larger}} {{randomized}} controlled trial on HIV-infected Zambian children, which revealed that cotrimoxazole prophylaxis reduced morbidity and mortality despite a background of high cotrimoxazole resistance. The impact of cotrimoxazole on the carriage and antibiotic resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae as major causes of childhood mortality in HIV-infected children was investigated since these are unclear. Representative nasopharyngeal swabs were taken prior to randomization for 181 of 534 children (92 on cotrimoxazole and 89 on placebo). Bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility were performed by routine methods. Due to reduced mortality, prophylactic cotrimoxazole increased the median time from randomization to the last specimen from 48 to 56 months (P = 0. 001). The carriage of H. influenzae was unaltered by cotrimoxazole. Carriage of S. pneumoniae increased slightly in both arms but {{was not statistically significant}} in the placebo arm. In S. pneumoniae switching between carriage and no carriage in consecutive pairs of samples was unaffected by cotrimoxazole (P = 0. 18) with a suggestion that the probability of remaining <b>carriage</b> <b>free</b> was lower (P = 0. 10). In H. influenzae cotrimoxazole decreased switching from carriage to no carriage (P = 0. 02). Cotrimoxazole resistance levels were higher in postbaseline samples in the cotrimoxazole arm than in the placebo arm (S. pneumoniae, P < 0. 0001; H. influenzae, P = 0. 005). Cotrimoxazole decreased switching from cotrimoxazole resistance to cotrimoxazole sensitivity in S. pneumoniae (P = 0. 002) and reduced the chance of H. influenzae remaining cotrimoxazole sensitive (P = 0. 05).

(We should be sitting on a seat on the Gutsch and looking down on the Lucerne of Utopia, a Lucerne that would, I insist, quite arbitrarily, still keep the Wasserthurm and the Kapellbrucke.)

We know that order and justice do not come by Nature--"if only the policeman would go away." [...] These things mean intention, will, carried to a scale that our poor vacillating, hot and cold earth has never known. What I am really seeing more and more clearly is the will beneath this visible Utopia. Convenient houses, admirable engineering that is no offence amidst natural beauties, beautiful bodies, and a universally gracious carriage, these are only the outward and visible signs of an inward and spiritual grace. Such an order means discipline. It means triumph over the petty egotisms and vanities that keep men on our earth apart; it means devotion and a nobler hope; it cannot exist without a gigantic process of inquiry, trial, forethought and patience in an atmosphere of mutual trust and concession. Such a world as this Utopia is not made by the chance occasional co-operations of self-indulgent men, by autocratic rulers or by the bawling wisdom of the democratic leader. And an unrestricted competition for gain, an enlightened selfishness, that too fails us....|$|R
40|$|Muscular {{explosive}} {{power of}} the lower extremities is a critical performance factor in many types of sports. The most widely used test to measure explosive power is the jump test, which is considered the gold standard owing to its validity and reproducibility. However, the jump test involves complex movement that creates problems of repeatability and spinal overload. In contrast, the leg press test appears easier to perform and less problematic as regards repeatability and overloading. Use of the push test has been reported elsewhere, but to our knowledge no published data are available that correlate the jump and the push tests. To fill this gap, the aim of our study was to verify correlations between the two tests in order to validate the push test as a method for measuring explosive power of human leg extensor muscles and to identify the optimal load to be applied with this method for obtaining maximum mechanical power. The study population comprised a group of 16 physically active males randomly assigned to two different testing sessions: one with the push test {{and the other with}} the jump test. In both tests muscular power without countermovement was measured. The push test was performed on a horizontal press (Technogym Italia) with the subject in a sitting position and the knees and hips bent to 90 °. The subject was asked to push as hard as possible against the carriage using both legs while the <b>carriage</b> was <b>free</b> to move backward along two tracks. A series of tests were performed using progressively heavier loads (100 - 120 - 140 - 160 - 180 - 200 % of body weight). The test was repeated 3 times with each load. The jump test was performed with the subject starting in a semisquat position with the knees bent to 90 °. Tests were carried out using natural weight (body weight) and progressively increased loads (10 - 20 - 30 - 40 - 50 % of body weight) on a force platform. The test was performed in triplicate for each load. For both the jump and push tests, parameters were measured using an encoder (ErgoPace Italia) fixed to the floor (jump test) or to the press stand (push test). Measurement of translational load shifting was processed using dedicated software in order to obtain data on strength, speed and power. For each test method and subject, the power output values for each load were then interpolated to determine peak power output and amount of load expressed as per cent of body weight to which they corresponded. Data on strength, speed and power obtained for the load corresponding to the power peak were analyzed to compare the two tests. The results showed a statistically significant correlation between the two test methods as regarded strength and power (r= 0. 723; P< 0. 001 and r= 0. 486; P< 0. 05, respectively), while speed emerged as an r coefficient of positive correlation but not statistically significant (r= 0. 297; P= 0. 264). The measurements obtained with the two test methods and compared using t-tests differed significantly for all parameters: strength resulted higher on the push test, while power and speed were higher on the jump test. Peak power was obtained with an overload of 78 % more than body weight on the push test and an overload of 7 % more than body weight on the jump test. The study results demonstrate the validity of the push test for measuring explosive muscular power of leg extensors. Therefore, this test can be used for comparing performance between subjects and long-term monitoring of training. The method also offers several advantages: ease of use, less involvement of coordination ability, better standardization of the method and less spinal overload. Furthermore, the different power outputs of the subject and the different loads with which peak power is achieved indicate that the two apparently similar methods used for the same purposes differ in motor action. While on the one hand the greater loads used in the push test are partly related to the presence of cams that facilitate application of strength in the initial phase of movement, the higher output values obtained in the jump test (greater power), related to the interaction of accessory muscle groups, especially the erector muscles of the spine and the buttocks, suggest greater specificity of the push test for estimating only the capability of muscular explosive {{power of the}} leg extensors, specifically of the extensors of the knee (quadriceps). Hence, the push test appears better indicted for evaluating this performance factor for longitudinal and/or transversal control. Moreover, these difference suggest the need for future studies to compare biomechanical characteristics of the two exercises, with evaluation of gesture cinematics, joint dynamics, electromyographic activity, and different muscle lengths. This would help to better define which muscular mechanics are specifically involved in the two different movements...|$|R

On 10 October 1922, a senior Free State army officer, Commandant Peter Doyle, of Ballinakill, Marshalstown, was shot in the grounds of St. Aidan's Cathedral, Enniscorthy, by anti-Treaty I.R.A. after mass. Five girls were injured in the process, two of them seriously. In November 1922, members of the South Wexford Brigade I.R.A. (anti-Treaty) ambushed a Lorry near Begerin, Old Ross, carrying Free State soldiers, killing one and wounding seven others. On 13 March 1923, three anti-Treaty I.R.A. prisoners held in Wexford Jail were executed by the Free State side. They were James Parle (of Clovervalley, Taghmon), John Creane (of Clonerane, Taghmon), and Patrick Hogan (of William Street, Wexford). They had been arrested 15 February 1923 for possession of firearms. Significantly, James Parle was second in command of Robert (or 'Bob') Lambert's Flying column - an anti-Treaty I.R.A. unit that operated in the Wexford town area, led by Bob Lambert. Bob Lambert was from Kyle, Crossabeg - hence this unit was referred to as the Kyle Flying Column. On 23 March 1923 three Free State soldiers were taken by anti-Treaty I.R.A. from a Public House at Ballagh, parish of Adamstown. They were taken to the village of Adamstown where they were shot dead later that night or early next morning, on 24 March 1923. The 3 men were Parick Horan (of Co. Kilkenny), Edward O'Gorman (of Co. Kilkenny), and Thomas Jones (of Dublin). A fourth Free State soldier, John Croke, was badly wounded when he was shot in the leg when he resisted the anti-Treaty I.R.A. as they initially entered the Pub. It is unclear what happened to a fifth soldier mentioned in the Army Reports, referred to as 'Vol. Keane'. This was a reprisal killing for the recent execution of Parle, Creane and Hogan. The next day, 25 March 1923, Free State soldiers shot dead Michael Furlong (of Ballagh) at Oldcourt, in the same parish, as they suspected that he was an anti-Treaty I.R.A. member (as he had fought in the recent Irish War of Independence in the I.R.A. - referred to, after the start of the Civil War, as the 'Old I.R.A.'). On 22 June 1923, Michael Radford of the South Wexford Brigade I.R.A. (anti-Treaty) was shot dead by Free State soldiers at Ballybuick, Tomhaggard. There were a number of other killings also. Some of these were stated to be 'accidental' - of which some genuinely were accidents and of which some were not. During all of this time the Railways were being attacked - many locations on numerous occasions, such as Palace East Station and Killurin Railway Station. A number of large houses were burnt down by anti-Treaty I.R.A. units, as alluded to previously - allegedly because they were used to billet Free State troops. This was certainly true in some cases, but some were victims of the bitterness of war. Free State soldiers also imprisoned many suspects.|$|R
5000|$|From its {{establishment}} in 1898, McWhirter & Son expanded rapidly. In 1899 McWhirter purchased the allotments at {{the northeast corner}} of the busy intersection of Wickham and Brunswick Streets, although these were not occupied by McWhirters for another three decades. In 1902 the firm also acquired land at 48 Warner Street, at the rear of their Brunswick Street shop, and extended the Brunswick Street building the depth of the block between Brunswick and Warner Streets. In 1905 they secured an adjoining allotment in Warner Street, on which they erected another warehouse, which appears to be an extension of the [...] building. In 1905 the firm was registered as a private company, McWhirter & Son Ltd, and by 1907 was listed at 292-298 Brunswick Street, having expanded into several adjacent shops east of the original building. By 1909 the firm employed 270 staff, had established a London office, directly imported many lines, and had developed an extensive mail-order department servicing all parts of rural Queensland, as well as clients in New South Wales, South Australia and British New Guinea. The firm pioneered the <b>free</b> <b>carriage</b> of mail-orders, and attracted a wide custom. The majority of their clientele were women, so besides drapery and a particularly fine millinery department, the firm stocked medicines, perfumes, silks, and home furnishings. The facade of the Brunswick Street building had been remodelled by 1909 with the first arcade front in Brisbane, and the firm's colourful window displays were a great attraction.In 1910 McWhirter acquired title to four more allotments in Warner Street, and between 1910 and 1914 to the two allotments in Brunswick Street occupied by his first store and adjacent premises to the west. The Warner Street land was situated between McWhirter's existing 48 Warner Street warehouse and Wickham Street, with long frontages to both streets. Reportedly purchased for £8,000, McWhirter intended to erect on this site, thoroughly modern and well-equipped buildings, such as will meet the requirements of the ever-increasing trade.McWhirter commissioned Brisbane architects Atkinson and McLay to design a substantial, five-storeyed building for this corner, and when completed in 1912, the new building became an immediate Valley landmark, seen for miles around, and dominated the Valley Corner area. Described as a vast emporium on its opening in October 1912 - and subsequently marketed as such by McWhirter - the store was well-appointed in fine materials. Every effort had been made to design the most modern and progressive of department stores, with new devices for the comfort, convenience and prompt attention to customers. On the ground level the extensive street frontages had the latest in island windows with narrow copper mouldings. There were five street entrances, and mosaic tiling and leadlights in the main vestibule. The interior was well-ventilated and well-lighted; fittings were of silky oak throughout; and the ceilings were lined with Wunderlich pressed metal. A sprinkler system was installed for fire prevention, there were three electric elevators for the convenience of customers, and the pneumatic cash tube system was the largest in the state. In an innovative move, hundreds of silky oak display tables permitted customers to browse and inspect goods without being dependent on sales assistants. Other goods were displayed in glass cabinets under glass counters, and there were sliding glass doors to the shelves behind the counters.|$|R
