5|$|TumbleSeed is an indie action video game, {{created by}} {{developer}} Benedict Fritz and designer Greg Wohlwend, {{in which the}} player balances a rolling seed on an ascending, horizontally slanted vine past procedurally generated obstacles {{to reach the top}} of a mountain. It is based on the mechanical arcade game Ice <b>Cold</b> <b>Beer</b> and built partially through the Cards Against Humanity game incubation program. TumbleSeed was released in May 2017 to generally favorable reviews on macOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows platforms. Critics, in particular, appreciated their haptic sense of the rolling seed from the Nintendo Switch's sensitive HD Rumble. Many reviewers noted TumbleSeed intense and sometimes uneven difficulty, which the developers hoped to address in a post-release update. They credited this stigma and a tepid critical reception for the game's slow sales, but were proud of their work.|$|E

500|$|The game {{received}} [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews, {{according to}} video game review aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers recommended the game, in particular, for short bursts of {{play with the}} portable Nintendo Switch. Reviewers considered the Nintendo Switch's HD Rumble {{a good fit for}} the game's core rolling mechanic and aesthetics. Nintendo Life said HD Rumble made the Switch's portable mode [...] "the definitive way to play" [...] TumbleSeed. Its haptic sensation approximated how it felt to play the mechanical Ice <b>Cold</b> <b>Beer.</b> Reviewers additionally compared the Ice <b>Cold</b> <b>Beer</b> conceit to the core mechanic of Shrek n' Roll (2007) and portable, plastic maze puzzles.|$|E

500|$|The game {{is based}} on Ice <b>Cold</b> <b>Beer,</b> a {{mechanical}} arcade game in which the player controls the ends of a metal rod to raise a rolling, metal ball vertically in a wooden cabinet while avoiding holes cut into the wood. The Chicago-based indie development team found the machine at an arcade where they competitively played the 2013 video game Killer Queen. Developer Benedict Fritz later prototyped a version of Ice <b>Cold</b> <b>Beer</b> in the Unity game engine with a simple white background and black, circular holes. His friend, designer Greg Wohlwend, who had previously worked on Threes and Ridiculous Fishing, saw a short, online video of Fritz's prototype and the two began {{to work together on}} the project by adding enemies, an in-game world, and procedurally generated levels. Their prototypes included dungeon crawl and open world, action-adventure genre explorations. They spent two years designing the title and wanted to honor and contribute to the legacy of Ice <b>Cold</b> <b>Beer.</b> They also worked through a Cards Against Humanity game incubation program in 2015, and several other indie developers based in Chicago joined the production: David Laskey, Jenna Blazevich, and composer Joel Corelitz. Based on the project's loose, collaboratory nature, Metro called the game's pedigree [...] "as indie as indie gaming gets". The team released a promotional trailer in August 2016 ahead of a demo at the PAX West game show.|$|E
500|$|The rest of {{the month}} proved to be {{difficult}} for the group. Oasis were due to record an episode of MTV Unplugged at the Royal Festival Hall but Liam pulled out, citing a sore throat. He watched the performance from a balcony with <b>cold</b> <b>beer</b> and cigarettes, heckling Noel's singing between songs. [...] Four days later the group left for a tour of American arenas but Liam refused to go; the band decided to continue the tour with Noel on vocals. Liam rejoined the tour on 30 August, and on 4 September 1996, Oasis performed [...] "Champagne Supernova" [...] at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Liam made gestures at Noel during his guitar solo, then spat beer all over the stage before storming off. A few weeks later Noel flew home without the band, who followed on another flight. This event prompted media speculation that the group were splitting up. The brothers soon reconciled and decided to complete the tour.|$|E
500|$|With Lisa {{now facing}} a long jail sentence, Marge decides {{to help her}} out. She starts reading Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species and becomes {{addicted}} to it. When the trial resumes, Marge tells Lisa that she now knows a way that she can help her. While Ned is being cross-examined by Clarice, Marge gives Homer a <b>cold</b> <b>beer.</b> Homer, ecstatic at getting a beer, tries to open it unsuccessfully. The more he tries, the more primitive he gets, hooting and banging the bottle on the bench, disrupting the trial. Finally, Ned loses his cool and refers to Homer as a [...] "big monkey-faced gorilla." [...] Clarice then asks Ned to compare {{the picture of the}} [...] "missing link" [...] and Homer shaking the beer over his head, and asks if he truthfully believes Homer cannot be related to apes. Ned cannot and concedes victory to Lisa. Lisa kindly tells Ned that she fully respects religious beliefs, but she just does not think it is proper for the church to dominate the school, the same way that Mr. Flanders and Reverend Lovejoy do not want scientists taking over the church. Ned agrees and offers to take Lisa and his kids out for ice cream.|$|E

Originally, Eskimo Joe's was only a bar, but when the drinking age was raised from 18 to 21 in 1984, the business became a restaurant as well. The name came from the desire to express that Eskimo Joe's had the <b>coldest</b> <b>beer</b> in town.|$|R

500|$|Wohlwend's friend Benedict Fritz {{developed}} {{a prototype of}} a mechanical arcade game from a bar that they frequented in Chicago. When Wohlwend saw the video of Ice <b>Cold</b> <b>Beer</b> online, they began work on an open world, dungeon crawl version of the game, which became TumbleSeed. They also worked through a Cards Against Humanity game incubation program in 2015, and several other indie developers based in Chicago joined the production. Based on the project's loose, collaboratory nature, Metro called the game's pedigree [...] "as indie as indie gaming gets". With {{the announcement of the}} Nintendo Switch, the development team sought to become a [...] "flagship" [...] demonstration of the console's HD Rumble feature, in which the player proprioceptively [...] "feels" [...] in-game textures through the controller's fine-tuned vibrations. They cold-called Nintendo and began work together in June 2016, prior to the Switch's announcement. TumbleSeed was released on May 2, 2017, on Nintendo Switch, macOS, PlayStation 4, and Windows platforms. The developers credited the game's tepid critical reception and associated stigma of intense difficulty for the game's slow sales. While Wohlwend hoped that a post-release patch would resolve some of these issues, he did not expect the game to recoup its costs, though the team was proud of their product.|$|E

2500|$|Researching the case, {{he learns}} {{that on the}} day of the murder at the Crale's home, there were five others, each a {{possible}} suspect, and whom Poirot labels as [...] "the five little pigs" [...] - Meredith Blake, an amateur chemist; Phillip Blake, Meredith's brother; Angela Warren, Caroline's younger half-sister; Cecilia Williams, the Crale's governess; and Elsa Greer (now Lady Dittisham), a young model posing for Amyas' latest painting. The investigation into the murder by the police found that Amyas was poisoned by coniine, which had been put in a glass that he had drunk a <b>cold</b> <b>beer</b> from. The poison had been extracted by Meredith from poison hemlock and was subsequently stolen from his lab by Caroline, who confessed to its theft but claimed she did so with the intention of using it to commit suicide. Upon learning that Caroline had provided the glass and a bottle of <b>cold</b> <b>beer,</b> the police determined that she killed her husband over his relationship to his latest mistress, Elsa, who claimed that he planned to divorce his wife and marry her; this was a new development--although he frequently had mistresses, he had never shown signs of wanting to leave Caroline.|$|E

Customers write their orders on slips of paper, which are picked up by black-clad waiters. Soon after opening, the original downtown theater began offering occasional unique programming such as silent movies scored by local bands playing live accompaniment, food-themed films such as Like Water for Chocolate served with a dinner matching the meals shown on screen, and retrospectives of various directors and stars.|$|R

2500|$|Poirot {{reveals that}} the true murderer had been Elsa, who had become disillusioned and betrayed when she overheard Amyas reassure his wife {{that he had no}} {{intention}} of leaving her; he had made the promise to Elsa of doing so, merely to keep her from leaving so that he could complete his portrait of her, unaware that his model had taken his promise quite seriously. Although she falsely recalled the gist of this conversation, the mention of Caroline saying to Amyas, [...] "you and your women", showed to Poirot that Elsa was in the same category as all of Amyas' other, discarded mistresses, despite having been too young to realise this at the time, while he further notes that the remark made by Amyas of [...] "see to her packing" [...] was in regards to his intention to send Elsa packing once he was finished with his painting, and not about Angela; Caroline was distressed by his cruelty to Elsa despite his reassurances, and remonstrated with him on a second occasion about this. After overhearing their conversation, Elsa recalled seeing Caroline help herself to the coniine the day before, and stole some under the pretence of fetching a cardigan, which she then used on a glass of warm beer she provided Amyas; Poirot noted that his exclamation of [...] "everything tastes foul today," [...] meant that he must have drunk something already, before the <b>cold</b> <b>beer</b> that Caroline had provided, that had tasted foul as well. Amyas did not know he was poisoned until he began to become gradually weaker while Elsa was posing for his artwork, and that he knew by who by the [...] "malevolent glare" [...] he gave to the painting that Meredith had seen. Poirot notes the unusual vitality in the face of the portrait and says, [...] "It is a very remarkable picture. It is the picture of a murderess painted by her victim – it is the picture of a girl watching her lover die." ...|$|E
