The amplitudes of all three split EPR signals are linearly correlated to the concentration of the respective <b>S</b> <b>state.</b> We also show that the S 1 → S 2 transition proceeds without misses following a saturating flash at 1  °C, whilst substantial misses occur in the S 2 → S 3 transition following the second flash...|$|R

40|$|Based on Martin like potential, the S-wave {{masses of}} quarkonia have been reviewed. Resultant wave {{functions}} at zero inter quark separation are employed {{to compute the}} hyperfine splitting of the nS states and the leptonic and digamma decay widths of n^ 3 S_ 1 and n^ 1 S_ 0 states of quarkonia respectively. Analysis on the level differences of S-wave excited states of quantum mechanical bound systems show a systematic behaviour as n-increases. In view of such systematic behaviour expected for quarkonia, we observe that Y(4263) and X(4630) 1 ^ [...] states are closer to the 4 S and 6 <b>S</b> <b>states</b> while ψ(4415) and Z(4430) are closer to the 5 <b>S</b> <b>state</b> of cc̅ systems. Similarly we find Υ (10865) is not fit to be the 5 <b>S</b> <b>state</b> of bb̅ system. while Y_b (10880) observed by Belle or (10996) observed by Babar fit to be the 6 <b>S</b> <b>state</b> of bottonia. Our predicted leptonic width, 0. 242 keV of Υ (10579, 4 S) is in good agreement with the experimental value of 0. 272 ± 0. 029 keV. We predict the leptonic widths of the pure 5 S and 6 <b>S</b> <b>states</b> of upsilon states as 0. 191 keV and 0. 157 keV respectively. In the case of charmonia, we predict the leptonic widths of the 4 S, 5 S and 6 <b>S</b> <b>states</b> as 0. 654 keV, 0. 489 keV and 0. 387 keV respectively. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{have solved}} the {{time-dependent}} Schrödinger equation {{to analyze the}} time evolution of a hydrogen atom, initially in its ground 1 <b>s</b> <b>state,</b> interacting with a one- or two-color linearly polarized laser pulse which is tuned close to a two-photon resonance with the 2 <b>s</b> metastable <b>state.</b> The two-photon transition therefore does not involve an intermediate resonance state. Using a suitable combination of two laser pulses of different frequencies, population can be transferred from the 1 <b>s</b> <b>state</b> to the 2 <b>s</b> <b>state</b> via the continuum. In both the single-color and the two-color cases, a maximum amount of 17 % of population {{can be found in}} the 2 <b>s</b> <b>state</b> at the end of the pulse. We compare and interpret our results in terms of the time-independent Floquet eigenvalues. The system can also be modeled by an "essential states" two-level atom with decay. Both the Flooquet and the time-dependent solutions are compared with the model predictions. The model allows systematic optimization studies for population transfer under a wide range of laser pulse parameters. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

Economies are shown to converge if, and only if, technology is stationary around a common trend.

Examining data on the level of technology, capital's share, and the rental rate provides strong evidence that the continuous U. <b>S.</b> <b>states</b> converge rapidly to levels that are far apart.
