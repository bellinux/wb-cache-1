Other processes that use shielding gases have also replaced <b>carbon-arc</b> <b>welding</b> such as tungsten-arc welding (GTAW, or TIG), plasma-arc welding (PAW), and atomic-hydrogen welding (AHAW). Each of these processes, including <b>carbon-arc</b> <b>welding,</b> use a nonconsumable electrode. A filler metal is generally used to aid the bond in the workpieces.|$|E

50|$|Carbon {{arc welding}} (CAW) {{is a process}} which {{produces}} coalescence of metals by heating them with an arc between a non-consumable carbon (graphite) electrode and the work-piece. It was the first arc-welding process developed but is not used for many applications today, having been replaced by twin-carbon-arc welding and other variations. The purpose of arc welding is to form a bond between separate metals. In <b>carbon-arc</b> <b>welding</b> a carbon electrode is used to produce an electric arc between the electrode and the materials being bonded. This arc produces temperatures in excess of 3,000 °C. At this temperature the separate metals form a bond and become welded together.|$|E
