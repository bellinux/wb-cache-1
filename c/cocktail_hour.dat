5|$|Each {{year the}} event has a theme, and {{includes}} a <b>cocktail</b> <b>hour</b> and a formal dinner. During the <b>cocktail</b> <b>hour,</b> guests arrive {{to walk on the}} red carpet, tour the year's special themed exhibition, and be seated before the dinner party that includes entertainment from the preeminent entertainers of the day. The theme not only sets the tone for the annual exhibit, but also for the guests who attempt to dress to uphold the theme of the year, oftentimes causing runs on certain fashion themes among the world's leading fashion retailers. Sometimes, such as in 2013, the theme is a bit befuddling because it does not provide a clear stylistic directive, while at other times, such as 2014 the theme may be far more challenging to one gender than the other.|$|E

500|$|MacPhisto {{was created}} to parody the devil and was named after Mephistopheles of the Faust legend. Initially called [...] "Mr. Gold", MacPhisto wore a gold lamé suit with gold {{platform}} shoes, pale makeup, lipstick, and devil's horns atop his head. As MacPhisto, Bono spoke with an exaggerated upper-class English accent, {{similar to that of}} a down-on-his-luck character actor. The character was created as a European replacement for the American-influenced Mirror Ball Man. The initial inspiration for MacPhisto came from the stage musical The Black Rider. Realisation of the character did not come about until rehearsal the night before the first of the 1993 shows. According to Bono, [...] "We came up with a sort of old English Devil, a pop star long past his prime returning regularly from sessions on The Strip in Vegas and regaling anyone who would listen to him at <b>cocktail</b> <b>hour</b> with stories from the good old, bad old days." [...] MacPhisto sang the closing [...] "Can't Help Falling in Love" [...] with an oddly childlike manner that many reviewers found one of the most poignant moments of the show.|$|E
50|$|Because {{they are}} often served during <b>cocktail</b> <b>hours,</b> it is often desired that a canapé be either salty or spicy, in order to {{encourage}} guests to drink more. A canapé may also be referred to as finger food, although not all finger foods are canapés. Crackers or small slices of bread or toast or puff pastry, cut into various shapes, serve as the base for savory butters or pastes, often topped with a “canopy” of savory foods as meat, cheese, fish, caviar, foie gras, purées or relish.|$|R

At Woolley’s Classic Suites, each guest room is a suite with a separate living room and bedroom. For leisure travelers, the extra space afforded by the living room allows for the room to be easily converted into a bedroom for sleeping up to two additional guests. The space also allows business travelers the opportunity for separate working and sleeping areas. Each location will welcome guests through a lush, oasis-style atrium and provide complimentary breakfasts and <b>cocktail</b> <b>hours,</b> hallmarks of the Woolley tradition.|$|R

2500|$|The Tender Trap {{operated}} on Sunday nights, in the theatre-restaurant {{room of the}} legendary Les Girls building in Sydney's infamous Kings Cross, New South Wales. [...] The Les Girls Building stood prominently {{on the corner of}} Darlinghurst Road and Roslyn Street, {{in the heart of the}} Cross, an area popularly known as [...] "the Golden Mile". The original Les Girls review, featuring gorgeous [...] "drag queens" [...] including the leading lady Carlotta, had performed in the building since 1963, but in the early 1990s the review decided to go on the road inspired by the film Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, leaving the building unused. The Les Girls building carried some intense history; it was owned by Sydney identity Abe Saffron; Kings Cross activist Juanita Nielsen was last seen here; various ghosts were rumoured to call it home. But in 1994 the building was still remarkably intact, a piece of living history. Seeing an opportunity, Sydney filmmaker and DJ Sean O'Brien approached the management, and procured the use of the cabaret room for Sunday nights. Sean named the Sunday night cabaret club after the Frank Sinatra song, and the Tender Trap first opened its doors on 11 December 1994, at the <b>cocktail</b> <b>hour</b> of 7pm. The performer on the opening night was singer Stuart Grant with his jazz combo. Stuart had previously been in the infamous 1980s post punk band the Primitive Calculators.|$|E

60|$|But {{the same}} {{stimulus}} {{to the human}} organism will not continue to produce the same response. By and by I discovered there was no kick at all in one cocktail. One cocktail left me dead. There was no glow, no laughter tickle. Two or three cocktails were required to produce the original effect of one. And I wanted that effect. I drank my first cocktail at eleven-thirty when I took the morning's mail into the hammock, and I drank my second <b>cocktail</b> an <b>hour</b> later just before I ate. I got {{into the habit of}} crawling out of the hammock ten minutes earlier so as to find time and decency for two more cocktails ere I ate. This became schedule--three <b>cocktails</b> in the <b>hour</b> that intervened between my desk and dinner. And these are two of the deadliest drinking habits: regular drinking and solitary drinking.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{dorsal root}} ganglia (DRG) neuron is an {{invaluable}} tool in axon growth, growth factor regulation, myelin formation and myelin-relevant researches. The purification of DRG neurons is a key step in these studies. Traditionally, purified DRG neurons were obtained in two weeks after exposure to several rounds of anti-mitotic reagent. Methods and Results: In this report, a novel, simple and efficient method for DRG purification is presented. DRG cultures were treated once with a high-dose anti-mitotic reagent <b>cocktail</b> for 72 <b>hours.</b> Using this new method, DRG neurons were obtained with 99 % purification within 1 week. We confirmed that the neurite growth and {{the viability of the}} purified DRG neurons have no difference from the DRG neurons purified by traditional method. Furthermore, P 0 and MBP expression was observed in myelin by immunocytochemistry in the DRG/SC co-culture system. The formation of mature node of Ranvier in DRG-Schwann cell co-culture system was observed using anti-Nav 1. 6 and anti-caspr antibody. Conclusion and Significance: The results indicate that this high dose single treatment did not compromise the capacity of DRG neurons for myelin formation in the DRG/SC co-culture system. In conclusion, a convenient approach for purifying DRG neurons was developed which is time-saving and high-efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Aortic, mitral and {{pulmonary}} {{valve replacement}} is routinely performed with reasonable clinical results. But the optimal {{substitute for the}} tricuspid valve remains controversial. Contemporary prostheses either mechanical or bioprosthetic {{are associated with a}} high risk of thrombosis and/or structural failure. Mitral allografts could have advantages over existing prostheses, especially in patients with infectious endocarditis. We describe our first experience with cryopreserved mitral allograft processing and implantation into the tricuspid position in a sheep experimental model. Material and Methods: We subjected 20 sheep (age 1 year, weight 23 - 36 kilograms) to general anesthesia and a left thoracotomy. An epicardial echocardiographic study was performed and the mitral valve was harvested. Donor animals were put to death by intravenous anesthetics injection. Allografts were immersed into cultivation medium E 199 with an antibiotic <b>cocktail.</b> After 24 <b>hours</b> storage at the temperature of 37. 0 oC the valves were kept at + 5 to + 7 oC over a period of 3 - 5 days.

40|$|Successful genetic {{treatment}} of most primary immunodeficiencies or hematological disorders {{will require the}} transduction of pluripotent, self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) rather than their progeny {{in order to achieve}} enduring production of genetically corrected cells and durable immune reconstitution. Current ex vivo transduction protocols require manipulation of HSC by culture in cytokines for various lengths of time depending upon the retroviral vector that may force HSC to enter pathways of proliferation, and possibly differentiation, that could limit their engraftment potential, pluripotentiality and long-term repopulating capacity. We have compared the ability of normal CD 34 + cells cultured in a standard cytokine <b>cocktail</b> for 18 <b>hours</b> or 4. 5 days to reconstitute XSCID dogs following bone marrow transplantation {{in the absence of any}} pre-transplant conditioning with that of freshly isolated CD 34 + cells. CD 34 + cells cultured under standard γ-retroviral transduction conditions (4. 5 days) showed decreased engraftment potential and ability to sustain long-term thymopoiesis. In contrast, XSCID dogs transplanted with CD 34 + cells cultured for 18 hours showed a robust T cell immune reconstitution similar to dogs transplanted with freshly isolated CD 34 + cells, however, the ability to sustain long-term thymopoiesis was impaired. These results emphasize the need to determine ex vivo culture conditions that maintain both the engraftment potential and “stem cell ” potential of the cultured cells...|$|R
