25|$|From {{a man in}} Iowa, Walker heard {{good things}} about Minneapolis, Minnesota, and moved there in 1862. He arrived at Saint Paul where he met and sold grindstones, once to James Jerome Hill, then {{employed}} as a clerk who carefully sorted them for the buyer. Within one hour of his arrival in Minneapolis, he {{was hired as a}} <b>chainman</b> to George B. Wright, who was surveying federal pine lands in the north of the state. He became a deputy surveyor within a few days. His application to become assistant professor in mathematics at the University of Wisconsin had been accepted but he loved his new career and turned it down. Walker worked for twelve years on government surveys and on surveys for the St. Paul and Duluth Railroad. His work took him away from home for long periods, and it gave him intricate knowledge of what property to buy in northern Minnesota. He began to acquire pine land in 1867, but without capital of his own, he partnered at first with Dr. Levi Butler and Howard W. Mills and later with others.|$|E

50|$|Survey assistants or <b>chainmen</b> {{are usually}} unskilled workers who help the surveyor. They place target reflectors, find old {{reference}} marks, and mark {{points on the}} ground. The term 'chainman' derives from past use of measuring chains. An assistant would move {{the far end of}} the chain under the surveyor's direction.|$|R

50|$|Roy {{was without}} any {{military}} rank {{at this time}} but Watson appointed him {{as an assistant to}} the quartermaster to provide him some seniority over the group of (typically) 6 soldiers who travelled with him: an NCO, two end markers, two <b>chainmen</b> and a batman.From 1749 he was joined by another five junior surveyors for various periods of time: notable among these young assistants were Paul Sandby (born 1731), later renowned for his watercolour landscapes, and a seventeen-year-old David Dundas (born 1735), later Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.|$|R
2500|$|Distances {{were always}} {{measured}} in chains and links, based on Edmund Gunter’s 66 foot measuring chain. [...] The chain--an actual metal chain--was {{made up of}} 100 links, each being [...] long. Eighty chains constitute one U.S. Survey Mile (which differs from the International Mile by a few millimeters). [...] There were two chainmen, one at each end, who physically made the measurements, one of them typically also acting as [...] "compassman" [...] to establish the correct bearing at each chain placement. [...] In forested areas, it was essential for rapid progress and accuracy that the lead <b>chainman</b> follow the correct bearing at all times, since no straightening of the chain was possible without backtracking around trees and re-measuring. [...] It was also necessary to keep the chain level, since all surveying distances {{are based on the}} horizontal, not slope, distance. [...] In steep terrain, this meant either shortening the chain, or raising one end of the chain relative to the other, or both. In areas where measuring by chain was not possible, such as extremely steep terrain or that with water obstructions, distances were calculated by triangulation.|$|E
6000|$|Secretary Wilson became {{interested}} in gunpowder through an event that occurred on the Government experimental farm in the District of Columbia. One day, several years ago, a rogue imperfectly reverent of the Secretary's profound attainments and personal character presented him with a sack of gunpowder, representing it as the sed of the Flashawful flabbergastor, a Patagonian cereal of great commercial value, admirably adapted to this climate. The good Secretary was instructed to spill it along in a furrow and afterward inhume it with soil. This he at once proceeded to do, and had made a continuous line of {{it all the way}} across a ten-acre field, when he was made to look backward by a shout from the generous donor, who at once dropped a lighted match into the furrow at the starting-point. Contact with the earth had somewhat dampened the powder, but the startled functionary saw himself pursued by a tall moving pillar of fire and smoke and fierce evolution. He stood for a moment paralyzed and speechless, then he recollected an engagement and, dropping all, absented himself thence with such surprising celerity that to the eyes of spectators along the route selected he appeared like a long, dim streak prolonging itself with inconceivable rapidity through seven villages, and audibly refusing to be comforted. [...] "Great Scott! what is that?" [...] cried a surveyor's <b>chainman,</b> shading his eyes and gazing at the fading line of agriculturist which bisected his visible horizon. [...] "That," [...] said the surveyor, carelessly glancing at the phenomenon and again centering his attention upon his instrument, [...] "is the Meridian of Washington." ...|$|E

50|$|In April James and Alexander Mackay {{set out for}} the West Coast. They {{joined up}} with the Nelson {{surveyor}} John Rochfort and his <b>chainmen</b> before reaching the Alps, and caught out in snow, spent three weeks making the crossing. James and Alexander then waited on the West Coast for all the Maori of importance to assemble at Arahura, the centre of their greenstone (pounamu) industry. When negotiations at last began towards the end of July, Mackay again found the Maori demanding more money and reserves than he was permitted to allocate. They wanted £2,500 and an estimated area of 200,000 acres, and this time they were unmoved by his threats of dealing with Ngati Toa instead. When negotiations broke down, he was forced to go to Auckland to receive new instructions.|$|R
50|$|The main {{criminal}} {{organization in}} the country is the Tsui Tong (analog for the Triad), which has a certain degree of freedom to operate within the semi-independent port city of Kai Shan due to the aid and support they gave the Emperor during the Black Cycle, which brought Shou Lung back from the brink of ruin. There are no Imperial troops stationed in Kai Shan, nor are there any magistrates or town guard. The city's reputation is its greatest defense, though the Shou fleet could certainly counter any attempts by outsiders to invade the city, as it is technically still a part of Shou Lung, and surrounded by other Imperial territories. It is rumored that the Tsui have contacts with the <b>Chainmen</b> (though selling Shou citizens to slavers would surely bring the wrath of the Emperor down on the city, if discovered), the Tenth Pit, and even the Zhentarim of Faerûn.|$|R
50|$|The Town of Washington was {{formerly}} {{the location of}} a trading post utilized by frontier families and members of the resident Manahoac tribe. All of the territory in and around the current town was under the ownership of Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron. In 1748, Lord Fairfax met a 16-year-old George Washington, a distant relative of his. Being impressed by his character, Fairfax employed Washington to survey his lands west of the Blue Ridge Mountains. On July 24, 1749, the town layout as it appears today was surveyed and platted by Washington with the assistance of his <b>chainmen</b> John Lonem and Edward Corder as part of his service to Fairfax. The village was officially established as a Town by the Virginia General Assembly on December 14, 1795 when it gained the requisite population of 200. Records from an 1835 gazetteer state that the town contained one academy, fifty-five dwellings, four mercantile stores, two taverns, one house of worship, twenty-seven trade shops, and two large flour mills.|$|R

50|$|The {{following}} year, 1872, Roberts was {{not able}} to start recruiting for the 1872 Western survey until June. Haydon had just completed the construction of the Frederick and Pennsylvania Line Railroad and was hired by Roberts. In July 23, 1872, Haydon led the railroad survey party from Fort Ellis, a United States Army fort, east of present-day Bozeman, Montana, consisting of Haydon, chief of party, two principal assistants, in charge of the compass and level, together with rodmen, <b>chainmen,</b> and others (altogether 20 men). Haydon supply train consisted of almost seventy wagons with rations for 105 days and a small herd of beef cattle. Haydon's military escort, commanded by Major Eugene Baker, Second Cavalry, consisting of four companies, 187 men, of the Second Cavalry, and four companies, 189 men, of the Seventh Infantry.Haydon's mission was to follow the Yellowstone River down stream to the mouth of Powder River a distance of 310 miles. Haydon to meet up with another survey party coming in from Fort Rice in North Dakota on the Missouri river, a distance of over 240 miles to Powder river.Haydon was to return from the Powder via the Musselshell River following this river to its source. The survey party and military escort proceeded without the benefit of Crow Indian scouts, largely due to rumors of a Sioux-Cheyenne attack or preparations for multiple river crossings with ferry boats. Given these difficulties, Haydon had progressed only 155 miles from Fort Ellis, he was still short 125 miles of his destination of the Powder and had not yet gone beyond where Muhlenberg had finished the year before.|$|R

50|$|The {{method of}} {{surveying}} a field or other {{parcel of land}} with Gunter's chain is to first determine corners and other significant locations, and then to measure the distance between them, taking two points at a time. The surveyor is assisted by a <b>chainman.</b> A ranging rod (usually a prominently coloured wooden pole) {{is placed in the}} ground at the destination point. Starting at the originating point the chain is laid out towards the ranging rod, and the surveyor then directs the <b>chainman</b> to make the chain perfectly straight and pointing directly at the ranging rod. A pin is put in the ground at the forward end of the chain, and the chain is moved forward so that its hind end is at that point, and the chain is extended again towards the destination point. This process is called ranging, or in the US, chaining; it is repeated until the destination rod is reached, when the surveyor notes how many full lengths (chains) have been laid, and he can then directly read how many links (one-hundredth parts of the chain) are in the distance being measured.|$|E
