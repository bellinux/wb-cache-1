A dish originating from Taiyuan, the provincial capital, is Taiyuan Tounao (太原头脑, literally [...] "Taiyuan Head"). It is a breakfast dish; a porridge-like stew made with mutton, <b>Chinese</b> <b>yam</b> (山药), lotus roots, astragalus membranaceus (黄芪, membranous milk vetch), tuber onions, and yellow cooking wine for additional aroma. It can be enjoyed by dipping pieces of unleavened flatbread into the soup, and is reputed to have medicinal properties. Pingyao is famous for its unique salt beef, while the areas around Wutai Shan are known for wild mushrooms. The most popular local spirit is fenjiu, a [...] "light fragrance" [...] variety of baijiu that is generally sweeter than other northern Chinese spirits.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} was to evaluate the effects of extrusion on antioxidant abilities of the extrudates of corn fortified with various (<b>Chinese)</b> <b>yams.</b> The flours from three yam varieties were used, including Dioscorea alata L. var. Tai-nung No. 1 (TN 1), D. alata L. var. Ta-shan (TS), and Dioscorea doryophora var. Hang-chun (HC). One commercial yam flour (TJ) was also used. Six antioxidant assays were conducted, such as 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 - picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging effect, oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay, ferrous ion chelating (FIC) ability, 2, 2 -azino-bis-(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid) (ABTS) free radical scavenging activity, superoxide radical scavenging (SORS) assay, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay. The influences of extrusion on the antioxidant activities of corn were determinedly different in different assays, showing a dramatic increase of ABTS value but significant reductions of SORS and TBARS values. The effects of extrusion on antioxidant activities of corn–yam mixtures varied with yams in different assays. Overall, extrusion processing increased the TBARS inhibition ability for all yams and generally had no negative impact on DPPH, ORAC, FIC, and ABTS antioxidant abilities for most yams in corn–yam extrudates. The involvement of the addition of yam to the antioxidant activities of corn–yam extrudates during extrusion could be suggested through two different possible approaches, the effects of extrusion on the antioxidant activities of yams (susceptible, resistant, or improved), {{and the effects of}} added yams on the antioxidant activities of corn during extrusion...|$|R

The tableting properties of the binary and ternary mixtures of the drug/starch/excpients were assessed using the 3 -D modeling parameters. The crushing force (CF) of the tablets and the drug release properties were evaluated. The effect of dicalcium phosphate dihydrate on the compaction and drug release properties of the matrices was also investigated. The results obtained indicate that the tablet formation properties of the starches depend on the Dioscorea starch used and on the concentration of drug present in the matrix tablets. There {{appears to be a}} decrease in the CF of the tablets as the concentration of drug in the matrix is increased. Inclusion of dicalcium phosphate dihydrate in the tablet matrix increased the bonding in the matrix tablets leading to an increase in CF of the tablets. The drug release from the matrices, and the release rates and mechanism were also dependent on the Dioscorea starch used and the drug concentration. Modified Bitter Yam starch matrices provided a controlled release of diclofenac for up to 5 hours while modified <b>Chinese</b> <b>Yam</b> starches provided controlled release for over 24 hours. The release mechanism from modified <b>Chinese</b> <b>Yam</b> starch matrices was found to be Super Case-II transport or time-independent release kinetics. Furthermore, the release rates were dependent on the concentration of the drug present in the matrix. Thus, the modified starch matrices could be used to achieve different drug release profiles depending on the intended use of the tablets. The addition of dicalcium phosphate dihydrate not only improved themechanical properties of the tablets but also altered the release rates and kinetics.
