40|$|Background and Purpose: Several {{different}} {{methods of teaching}} laparoscopic skills have been advocated, with virtual reality surgical simulation (VRSS) being the most popular. Its effectiveness in improving surgical performance is not a consensus yet, however. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether practicing surgical skills in a virtual reality simulator results in improved surgical performance. Materials and Methods: Fifteen medical students recruited for the study were divided into three groups. Group I (control) did not receive any VRSS training. For 10 weeks, group II trained basic laparoscopic skills (camera handling, cutting skill, peg transfer skill, and clipping skill) in a VRSS laparoscopic skills simulator. Group III practiced the same skills and, in addition, performed a simulated cholecystectomy. All students then performed a cholecystectomy in a swine model. Their performance was reviewed by two experienced surgeons. The following parameters were evaluated: Gallbladder pedicle dissection time, <b>clipping</b> <b>time,</b> time for cutting the pedicle, gallbladder removal time, total procedure time, and blood loss. Results: With practice, there was improvement in most of the evaluated parameters by each of the individuals. There were no statistical differences in any of evaluated parameters between those who did and did not undergo VRSS training, however. Conclusion: VRSS training is assumed to be an effective tool for learning and practicing laparoscopic skills. In this study, we could not demonstrate that VRSS training resulted in improved surgical performance. It may be useful, however, in familiarizing surgeons with laparoscopic surgery. More effective methods of teaching laparoscopic skills should be evaluated to help in improving surgical performance. University of Sao Paulo (USP) Medical Schoo...|$|E

O recorte de tempo foi delimitado de maio de 2012 a agosto de 2013, em decorrência do Manifesto TPM, descrito como um movimento contra os estereótipos e clichês contra as mulheres. Para alcançar esse objetivo, escolhermos desenvolver uma pesquisa exploratória, bibliográfica e documental, com análise de imagens. O caminho de estudo das capas foi apoiado sobre a análise iconográfica e interpretação iconológica, propostas por Panofsky (2009). O trabalho se sustenta sobre os preceitos de Estudos Culturais e visualidade, com Hall e Eagleton e Belting, Català Domènech e Baitello Jr.; no imaginário e imaginário midiático, propostos por Durand, Morin e Contrera; e, por fim, nos entendimentos de consumo de Haug, Baudrillard e Barbosa e Campbell. Assim, pudemos identificar que a revista TPM e seu Manifesto TPM se entendem como grandiosos e feministas, no entanto, as imagens (e mesmo alguns textos) das capas não são coerentes com esse discurso, o que nos levou a inferir que embora louvável pela proposta, o Manifesto TPM não se desvencilhou dos imaginários e ideologias vigente acerca de corpo e beleza femininos.

This resulted in two identical video clips for each situation, 60 video <b>clips</b> in real <b>time</b> (mean duration 3.08  s) and the same 60 video clips in slow motion (mean duration 12.32  s). The same information was present in both video speed conditions, only the temporal dynamics were modulated. The video clips are MP 4 files (720 × 406 pixels), with good quality and with the background sound removed. Two independent and experienced ex-international referees, still involved as referee match observers for UEFA, determined the reference decisions based on the rules established by Law 12 : Foul and Misconduct (FIFA, 2016). Both modes (real time and slow motion) were available to determine the reference decisions. These two referees were able to view the <b>clips</b> multiple <b>times</b> and they knew the decisions that had been made by the original referees during the game. As an expert panel, both referees made independent evaluations first and then discussed the video clips with the UEFA chief refereeing officer to resolve any disagreement.

We present {{a case of a}} live completely retroperitoneal ectopic pregnancy in the right obturator fossa.

The postoperative course was uneventful and s-betahCG normalized in five weeks. Histopathology of the intact specimen showed trophoblast surrounded by lymphatic tissue.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{reliability}} of the evaluation of Audio Melody Extraction algorithms. We focus on the procedures and collections currently used as part of the annual Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX), which has become the de-facto benchmark for evaluating and comparing melody extraction algorithms. We study several factors: the duration of the audio <b>clips,</b> <b>time</b> offsets in the ground truth annotations, and the size and musical content of the collection. The results show that the clips currently used are too short to predict performance on full songs, highlighting the paramount need to use complete musical pieces. Concerning the ground truth, we show how a minor error, specifically a time offset between the annotation and the audio, can have a dramatic effect on the results, emphasizing the importance of establishing a common protocol for ground truth annotation and system output. We also show that results based on the small ADC 04, MIREX 05 and INDIAN 08 collections are unreliable, while the MIREX 09 collections are larger than necessary. This evidences the need for new and larger collections containing realistic music material, for reliable and meaningful evaluation of Audio Melody Extraction. 1...|$|R
