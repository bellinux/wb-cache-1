Albion's first professionals earned 10 shillings (50 pence) per week, with no training allowance provided.|$|E

40|$|Purpose- The aim of {{this study}} is to examine whether {{frequency}} of audit <b>committee</b> <b>meetings</b> and attendance in audit committee are associated with accrual earnings management. Design/methodology/approach- The sample of the study is 14 companies under the Industrial Goods sub-sector listed under the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) for the years 2012 - 2014. Modified Jones Model (1995) was used to measure earnings management proxied by discretionary accruals. Findings- The findings show that frequency of audit <b>committee</b> <b>meetings</b> and attendance during the meetings negatively and significantly associated with discretionary accruals. Theoretical implications- This study extends the previous related literature by examining the association between audit <b>committee</b> <b>meetings</b> and attendance and earnings management. Practical implications- Regulators might use the findings of the study to regulate and further control the attendance of audit committee members during audit <b>committee</b> <b>meetings.</b> Originality/value- This paper uses agency theory to provide empirical evidence on the importance of frequent audit <b>committee</b> <b>meetings</b> and higher attendance in audit <b>committee</b> <b>meetings...</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} how {{the frequency of}} board <b>committee</b> <b>meetings</b> impacts on Australian firms’ financial performance. Data were collected from 118 Australian listed companies – including 26 financial firms and 92 nonfinancial firms – for the period 1999 – 2007. Analysis of that data shows that the frequencies of audit <b>committee</b> <b>meetings</b> and remuneration <b>committee</b> <b>meetings</b> are positively and significantly associated with return on equity and return on assets. The frequencies of risk <b>committee</b> <b>meetings</b> do not show any significant effects on the financial performance of Australian firms. Estimated results {{are found to be}} robust after controlling for internal as well as external governance mechanisms that might affect Australian firm performance...|$|R
5|$|At the State Defense <b>Committee</b> <b>meeting</b> on September 13 (the {{time of the}} Soviet Exercise Zapad-81 {{maneuvers}} and {{of renewed}} pressure on the Polish leadership), Kania was warned by the uniformed cadres that the progressing counterrevolution must be terminated by an imposition of martial law. The PZPR regional secretaries soon issued the same demands. Under the circumstances, in October First Secretary Kania stepped down and Prime Minister Jaruzelski became also the party chief.|$|E
5|$|Delegates, as {{they waited}} for the {{committees}} to complete their work, spent much of the first two days listening to various orators. Of these, only Senator Blackburn, a silver supporter, sparked much reaction, and that only momentary. Delegates called for better-known speakers, such as Altgeld or Bryan, but were granted neither then; the Illinois governor declined, and the Nebraskan, once seated, spent much of his time away from the convention floor at the platform <b>committee</b> <b>meeting</b> at the Palmer House.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Khrushchev {{opened a}} Central <b>Committee</b> <b>meeting</b> to {{hundreds}} of Soviet officials; some were even allowed to address the meeting. For the first time, {{the proceedings of the}} Committee were made public in book form, a practice which was continued at subsequent meetings. This openness, however, actually allowed Khrushchev greater control over the Committee, since any dissenters would have to make their case in front of a large, disapproving crowd.|$|E
40|$|This study {{contributes}} to the policy debate about independent audit committees by examining the occurrence and consequences of CEO attendance-by-invitation at audit <b>committee</b> <b>meetings.</b> We investigate {{whether this is a}} way for powerful CEOs to exert their influence over audit committee matters or an informal channel for information sharing between management and audit committees. We find that CEO attendance-by-invitation at audit <b>committee</b> <b>meetings</b> is positively related to firm complexity and firm governance practices, and is associated with lower earnings opacity. These results are consistent with CEO attendance-by-invitation at audit <b>committee</b> <b>meetings</b> enhancing information sharing between firm management and audit committees. Thus, this study identifies significant benefits from allowing CEOs to act as informal advisors at audit <b>committee</b> <b>meetings...</b>|$|R

5|$|On 2 April 1962, around 300 {{writers of}} various Indian {{languages}} {{were invited to}} Delhi for the two sessions conducted by Dharamvir Bharati in which the draft was finalised and later presented to Prasad. The first award selection <b>committee</b> <b>meeting</b> was scheduled on 16 March 1963 and Prasad was appointed as its president. However, Prasad died on 28 February 1963 and thus the scheduled meeting was chaired by Kalelkar and Sampurnanand acted {{as president of the}} committee.|$|E
5|$|The Union {{achieved}} much in {{its first}} few years: renting a building in the CBD {{to serve as a}} club and <b>committee</b> <b>meeting</b> place, making garments for hospitals, visiting kindergartens, the YWCA, Home of Peace, Infants' Home and the Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children. An Ex-Students' Orchestra and Dramatic Club were formed, and tennis and croquet matches were held between current and former pupils.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of King's College Hospital Dental School was proposed by Viscount Hambleden at a Hospital Management <b>Committee</b> <b>meeting</b> on 12 April 1923. The dental school was opened on 12 November 1923 in King’s College Hospital. Under the 1948 National Health Act, King's Medical and Dental School split from King's {{and became an}} independent school, but the school remerged with King's in 1983. The school further merged with the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals in 1998.|$|E

5|$|When a {{tropical}} depression intensifies into {{a tropical}} storm {{to the north of}} the Equator between 140°W and 180°, it is named by the CPHC. Four lists of Hawaiian names are maintained by the World Meteorological Organization's hurricane committee, rotating without regard to year, with the first name for a new year being the next name in sequence that was not used the previous year. Significant tropical cyclones have their names retired from the lists, with a replacement name selected at the next Hurricane <b>Committee</b> <b>meeting.</b>|$|E
5|$|At a 29 March 1965 Southeast Asia Coordinating <b>Committee</b> <b>meeting</b> at Udon Thani, Thailand {{attended}} by Ambassador Sullivan, {{representatives from the}} 2nd Air Division, MACV, and Air America, responsibilities within the Barrel Roll operational area were ironed out. Command {{and control of the}} air program would remain in the ambassador's hands. Operational control of U.S. air assets devolved from the commander-in-chief, Pacific Forces (CINCPAC) in Honolulu through his air deputy at Pacific Air Forces or PACAF, to the 2nd Air Division (after 1 April 1966, the Seventh Air Force). Targets could be requested by the Royal Lao government, the CIA, or by MACV.|$|E
5|$|Cooperation did {{not long}} survive the war. Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and the Hyde Park Agreement was not binding on {{subsequent}} administrations. In fact, it was physically lost. When Wilson raised {{the matter in}} a Combined Policy <b>Committee</b> <b>meeting</b> in June, the American copy could not be found. The British sent Stimson a photocopy on 18 July 1945. Even then, Groves questioned the document's authenticity until the American copy was located years later in the papers of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, Jr., Roosevelt's naval aide, apparently misfiled by someone unaware of what Tube Alloys was, who thought {{it had something to}} do with naval guns.|$|E

5|$|During {{their early}} years, West Bromwich Albion {{had played in}} {{whatever}} coloured kit was available locally. However, at a <b>committee</b> <b>meeting</b> held in September 1885, the club decreed that blue and white striped jerseys should be adopted on a permanent basis. With {{the exception of a}} brief trial of scarlet and blue broad stripes early in the 1889–90 season, the team have worn these colours ever since, although initially the blue was of a lighter shade; the navy blue stripes were not introduced until after the First World War.|$|E
5|$|He {{was chosen}} to chair a {{committee}} set up in 1951 to revise {{the rules of the}} Assembly. During a session on March 21, 1952, Dawson was pushed to name Arthur Wray, MLA for Banff-Cochrane, after Wray made remarks towards a provincial official at a <b>committee</b> <b>meeting.</b> When asked by Dawson to withdraw the remarks, Wray refused, prompting Dawson to name him and order his removal from the chamber. A unanimous motion was later passed to suspend Wray for two sitting days, or until he withdrew his remarks and delivered an apology to the chamber. Wray returned four days later, issuing an apology and retracting his remarks.|$|E
5|$|Karmal was {{appointed}} Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, synonymous with vice head of state, in the communist government. The Parchamite faction found itself under significant pressure by the Khalqists soon after taking power. In June 1978, a PDPA Central <b>Committee</b> <b>meeting</b> {{voted in favor}} of giving the Khalqist faction exclusive control over PDPA policy. This decision was followed by a failed Parchamite coup, after which Hafizullah Amin, a Khalqist, initiated a purge against the Parchamites. Karmal survived this purge but was exiled to Prague. Karmal remained in exile until December 1979, when the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan (with the consent of the Afghan government) to stabilize the country.|$|E

5|$|After the {{demotion}} of Malenkov, Khrushchev and Molotov initially {{worked together}} well, and the longtime foreign minister even proposed that Khrushchev, not Bulganin, replace Malenkov as premier. However, Khrushchev and Molotov increasingly differed on policy. Molotov opposed the Virgin Lands policy, instead proposing heavy investment to increase yields in developed agricultural areas, which Khrushchev felt was not feasible {{due to a}} lack of resources and a lack of a sophisticated farm labor force. The two differed on foreign policy as well; soon after Khrushchev took power, he sought a peace treaty with Austria, which would allow Soviet troops then in occupation of part of the country to leave. Molotov was resistant, but Khrushchev arranged for an Austrian delegation to come to Moscow and negotiate the treaty. Although Khrushchev and other Presidium members attacked Molotov at a Central <b>Committee</b> <b>meeting</b> in mid-1955, accusing him of conducting a foreign policy which turned the world against the USSR, Molotov remained in his position.|$|E
5|$|Even before Bradford City were {{guaranteed}} {{a place in}} the Football League, the club made its first acquisitions by signing Jack Forrest and Ben Prosser from Stoke on 1 May. These were followed by four more players joining the club; Sam Bright, George Robinson, Peter O'Rourke and Jimmy Millar. Despite not having enough players to field a full side, four club representatives travelled to London by the end of May for a league management <b>committee</b> <b>meeting,</b> when the club was elected into the Second Division. Money was raised to fund the club, including at least £2,000 from sponsors, a balance of £500 from Manningham FC and proceeds from a summer archery tournament. Bradford City also took over Manningham's Valley Parade ground for their home fixtures.|$|E
5|$|Hans von Halban {{had proved}} to be an unfortunate choice as he was a poor administrator, and did not work well with Mackenzie or the NRC. The Americans saw him as a {{security}} risk, and objected to the French atomic patents claimed by the Paris Group (in association with ICI). In April 1944 a Combined Policy <b>Committee</b> <b>meeting</b> at Washington agreed that Canada would build a heavy water reactor. Scientists who were not British subjects would leave, and Cockcroft became the new director of the Montreal Laboratory in May 1944. E. W. R. Steacie became assistant director and head of the Chemistry division when Paneth left. Volkoff eventually succeeded Placzek as head of the Theoretical Physics division. Halban remained as head of the nuclear physics division.|$|E
