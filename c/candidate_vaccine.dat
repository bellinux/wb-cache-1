40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The {{scope of}} this review is to provide {{the current status of}} HIV vaccine {{clinical}} development. A series of issues regarding the type of immune response stimulated by the <b>candidate</b> <b>vaccines</b> in the pipeline, the advances in the immune correlates of protection, the need for an effective decision-making process for selection of <b>candidate</b> <b>vaccines</b> into further clinical development and the rationale for clinical trials will also be discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: Efforts in the development of HIV vaccines inducing broad neutralizing antibodies have failed so far. The current pipeline is predominantly composed of <b>candidate</b> <b>vaccines</b> designed to induce cellular immunity and particularly T-cell response. For these reasons, these <b>candidate</b> <b>vaccines</b> have been termed 'T-cell vaccines'. A large number of <b>candidate</b> <b>vaccines</b> or vaccine combinations have entered phase I-II clinical trials in 2005. Furthermore, an adenovirus vector-based vaccine has entered proof-of-concept efficacy trial and a canarypox vector in combination with a protein-based vaccine is currently being evaluated in phase III clinical trials. T-cell vaccines {{have been shown to be}} safe and the most recent generation of these vaccines also has substantial immunogenicity.

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} {{the results of}} initial safety testing of 10 live-attenuated dengue virus (DENV) vaccine can-didates modified by serial passage in primary dog kidney (PDK) cells at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. The Phase 1 studies, conducted in 65 volunteers, were designed to select an attenuated <b>vaccine</b> <b>candidate</b> for each DENV serotype. No recipient of the DENV <b>candidate</b> <b>vaccines</b> sustained serious injury or required treatment. Three <b>vaccine</b> <b>candidates</b> were associated with transient idiosyncratic reactions in one volunteer each, resulting in their withdrawal from further clinical development. Increasing PDK cell passage of DENV- 1, DENV- 2, and DENV- 3 <b>candidate</b> <b>vaccines</b> increased attenuation for volunteers, yet also decreased infectivity and immunogenicity. This effect was less clear for DENV- 4 <b>candidate</b> <b>vaccines</b> following 15 and 20 PDK cell passages. Only one passage level each of the tested DENV- 2,- 3, and- 4 <b>vaccine</b> <b>candidates</b> was judged acceptably reactogenic and suitable for expanded clinical study.

50|$|The {{availability}} of several recombinant canarypox vectors has provided interesting results that {{may prove to}} be generalizable to other viral vectors. Increasing the complexity of the canarypox vectors by inclusion of more genes/epitopes has increased the percent of volunteers that have detectable CTL {{to a greater extent than}} did increasing the dose of the viral vector. Importantly, CTLs from volunteers were able to kill peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with primary isolates of HIV, suggesting that induced CTLs could have biological significance. In addition, cells from at least some volunteers were able to kill cells infected with HIV from other clades, though the pattern of recognition was not uniform among volunteers. Canarypox is the first candidate HIV vaccine that has induced cross-clade functional CTL responses.

50|$|Human {{monoclonal}} antibodies and vaccine design: Taking {{advantage of}} his studies on human memory B cells (16), Lanazvecchia developed novel and robust methods to immortalize human memory B cells and to preserve single plasma cells in culture (17, 18). He used these methods to interrogate the memory repertoire of selected individuals to isolate monoclonal antibodies with unique specificities. Several examples illustrate the power and utility of this approach. Neutralizing antibodies were isolated against SARS, cytomegalovirus, avian influenza and dengue virus. Unusually potent antibodies that neutralize human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) were isolated and their epitopes mapped to a pentameric glycoprotein complex, which is currently tested as a <b>candidate</b> <b>vaccine.</b> The most striking examples are antibodies with exceptional breadth, being able to neutralize all influenza A viruses and even four different paramyxoviruses (18,19). The methods to isolate human monoclonal antibodies developed by Lanzavecchia have realized a long-sought goal: the full exploitation of the human immune response for serotherapy and vaccine design. These fully human monoclonal antibodies can be used not only as drugs for prophylaxis and therapy of infectious diseases, but also as tools to identify vaccine candidates, a process defined as “analytic vaccinology” (20). The present work in Lanzavecchia’s laboratory addresses fundamental issues {{on the role of}} somatic mutations and the pathways leading to the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies and explores the relationship between infection and autoimmunity (21).|$|E

40|$|Rotavirus {{infection}} is among {{leading causes of}} severe diarrhea which often leads to severe dehydration, especially, in children under 5 years old. In Russia, the incidence of rotavirus {{infection is}} constantly increased, due to higher rates of actual rotavirus infection cases and improved diagnostics of the disease. Immunity to rotavirus is unstable, thus causing repeated infections intra vitam. Anti-infectious resistance in reconvalescents is explained by induction of specific IgM, IgG, and, notably, IgA antibodies. Due to absence of market drugs with direct action against rotavirus, a rational vaccination is considered {{the most effective way}} to control the disease. Currently available vaccines for prevention of rotavirus infection are based on live attenuated rotavirus strains, human and/or animal origin, which replicate in human gut. Their implementation may result into different complications. Meanwhile, usage of vaccines based on recombinant proteins is aimed to avoid risks associated with introduction of a complete virus into humans. In this paper, we studied protective activity of candidate vaccines against rotavirus. In this work we studied protective activity of a <b>candidate</b> <b>vaccine</b> against rotavirus infection based on recombinant FliCVP 6 VP 8 protein which includes VP 6 and VP 8, as well as components of Salmonella typhimurium flagellin (FliC) as an adjuvant. Different components are joined by flexible bridges. Efficiency of the <b>candidate</b> <b>vaccine</b> was studied in animal model using Balb/c mice. We have shown high level of protection which occurs when the <b>candidate</b> <b>vaccine</b> is administered twice intramuscularly. Complete protection of animals against mouse rotavirus EDC after intramuscular immunization with a <b>candidate</b> <b>vaccine</b> was associated with arising rotavirus-specific IgA and IgG antibodies in serum and intestine of immunized animals. The efficacy of <b>candidate</b> <b>vaccine</b> based on recombinant protein FliCVP 6 VP 8 against rotavirus infection was comparable to that of commercial Rotarix® vaccine (Glaxo Smith Kline), however, with higher safety of the <b>candidate</b> <b>vaccine,</b> due to absence of live virus in its composition.

MethodsWe did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, phase 1, dose-escalation study at one centre in Vienna, Austria. Healthy men and women aged 18 – 45 years with no comorbidities were randomly assigned, by computer-generated block randomisation (block size of 14), to receive either one of three escalating doses of the measles-virus-based <b>candidate</b> <b>vaccine</b> (low dose [1 · 5  ×  104 median tissue culture infection doses (TCID 50) per 0 · 05 mL], medium dose [7 · 5  ×  104 TCID 50 per 0 · 25 mL], or high dose [3 · 0  ×  105 TCID 50 per 1 · 0 mL]), or the active comparator—Priorix. Participants were additionally block-randomised to receive a booster injection on either day 28 or day 90 after the first vaccination. Participants and study investigators were masked to group allocation. The primary endpoint was the presence of neutralising anti-chikungunya antibodies on day 28, as assessed by 50 % plaque reduction neutralisation test. Analysis was by intention to treat and per protocol. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2013 - 001084 - 23. FindingsBetween Nov 22, 2013, and Feb 25, 2014, we randomly assigned 42 participants to receive the low dose (n= 12), the medium dose (n= 12), or the high dose (n= 12) of the measles-virus-based <b>candidate</b> <b>vaccine,</b> or Priorix (n= 6), of whom 36 participants (86 %; n= 9, n= 12, n= 10, n= 5, respectively) {{were included in the}} per-protocol population. The <b>candidate</b> <b>vaccine</b> raised neutralising antibodies in all dose cohorts after one immunisation, with seroconversion rates of 44 % (n= 4) in the low-dose group, 92 % (n= 11) in the medium-dose group, and 90 % (n= 10) in the high-dose group. The immunogenicity of the <b>candidate</b> <b>vaccine</b> was not affected by pre-existing anti-measles immunity.
