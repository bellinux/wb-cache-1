5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but {{it may have been}} Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The only known cast credit is for Marie Eline having been in the film as the young <b>child</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> pawned. The other cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the teachers’ opinions about inclusion of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind; the factors which may influence their opinions and what they think {{can be done to}} include <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind in primary schools. It was a qualitative study which purposely involved five teachers from two primary schools. Data was collected through interviews. The centre of interest in the study was on the acceptance of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind by the teachers; participation of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind in classroom and outdoor activities, benefits of placing <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind in mainstream primary schools, the challenges of including <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind in the mainstream and what teachers think ca be done to overcome such challenges. The study findings revealed that the nature of attitudes the teachers had towards <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind, additional disability and class size determined the teachers’ acceptance of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind. The teachers also believed that <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind can be helped to participate in school activities through classroom and physical environmental modifications; curriculum modifications and provision of specialised equipment. Teachers felt that placement of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind in the mainstream can make them achieve social benefits; academic benefits and acquire special skills. The study findings also revealed that for successful inclusion of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind, teachers needed support in the provision of special specialised equipment; collaboration with other professionals; construction and equipping the resource rooms where remedial support for <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind can be exercised. The following challenges were expressed by the teachers: Lack of skills and competence, large class sizes and lack of specialised equipment. In order to overcome these challenges, teachers used various methods of teaching for example peer teaching, cooperative learning and team teaching. It is suggested that training and re-training of teachers in the filed of Special Needs Education, provision of specialised equipment, recruitment of more teachers and awareness seminars may help in the inclusion of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> blind...|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{investigate}} {{the presence of}} hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) at first cardiac evaluation and during follow-up and cardiac events in predictively tested <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> mutation positive. Study design The study included 119 predictively tested <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> mutation positive, {{with a mean age}} of 12. 1 years. A family history and clinical variables from all cardiac evaluations after predictive genetic testing were recorded. Outcome measures were a clinical diagnosis of HCM, death, and cardiac events. Results No child died during a mean follow-up of 6. 9 +/- 3. 8 years: 95 children were evaluated more than once. Eight (6. 7 %) <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> mutation positive were diagnosed with HCM at one or more cardiac evaluation(s), some with severe hypertrophy. In one patient who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for HCM a cardiac event occurred during follow-up. She received an appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock 4 years after a prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted. Conclusion The risk for predictively tested <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> mutation positive to develop HCM during childhood and the risk of cardiac events in <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> phenotype negative <b>are</b> low. In <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> phenotype positive, however, severe hypertrophy and cardiac events can develop.
