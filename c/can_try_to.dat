5|$|The {{sideline}} 4...g5!? was {{not well}} regarded {{at the end of}} the 20th century. It weakens several squares—particularly f5 and h5—as they cannot be covered by the g-pawn any more. White <b>can</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> exploit these weaknesses with the manoeuvres Bf4–d2–c3 (pressure along the diagonal a1–h8), Ng1–e2–g3–h5 (pressure against the squares f6 and g7) and h2–h4 (to open the h-file). Nonetheless, the 4...g5 line has found new supporters in recent years thanks to black wins against both 5.Bg3 and 5.Bd2.|$|E
5|$|There are {{alternative}} uses of {{food power}} as well. An importer can refuse to continue import unless political concessions are made. This {{would have the}} same effects that an exporter refusing to export would have. An example of this would be American reduction of the Cuban sugar quota. In simple terms, the demand concentration (one importer being the dominant buyer) and supply dispersion (several exporters competing to sell the same product) an importer <b>can</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> use this exchange politically to their favor; this is especially effective if the exporter has little else so export (low action independence).|$|E
5|$|Kinstones {{are special}} {{artifacts}} which Link can find throughout his quest. Kinstone pieces are fragments of a medallion {{that are found}} {{throughout the course of}} the game. If the player can find a character or object with a Kinstone piece (indicated by a thought bubble above their heads), the player <b>can</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> fuse their Kinstone piece with one of their own to make a match. If a successful fusion is made, something will occur somewhere within the game's world, including the placement of treasure chests, access to secret areas and certain events which occur among certain characters. Whilst many Kinstone fusions are optional, some fusions, such as those which use Golden Kinstones, are necessary to advance the story.|$|E

5|$|Battles are turn-based, with random {{encounters}} {{taking place}} while exploring dungeons. At {{the end of}} a successful battle, experience points, money, and items are obtained. Experience points are shared by Nakajima and Yumiko; by gaining enough experience points, their levels raise, and they are given one ability point each, which can be given to one of five character attributes: strength, intelligence, attack, dexterity, and luck. During battles, the player <b>can</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> persuade enemy demons to join them, in exchange for magnetite, money, or items. The player can keep seven demons at a time, of which up to four can be summoned at the same time; summoned demons aid the player in battles with physical and magic attacks, but cost money to summon, and consume magnetite as the player walks around. The demons' attitude towards the player is governed by the moon phase, which cycles through eight phases from new to full. Demons do not level up; instead, the player can create stronger demons by visiting a special location and fusing two of their allied demons together into a new one.|$|E
5|$|In naval battles, players {{control a}} fleet of up to twenty varied ships, and use 18th-century tactics to {{overcome}} enemy fleets. As with army units, each ship's crew has a set amount of morale that changes as a battle progresses; a crew may attempt to withdraw their vessel from the battle if their morale is broken, or in extreme cases may surrender. A battle is won when all hostile ships have been sunk, captured, or have left the map. Individual ships can be maneuvered, or remain in formation with other ships from the fleet. Players can designate which parts of a hostile ship they want a crew to target, making ships prone to sustaining authentic damage during a battle: masts can be toppled, sails and gun ports can be destroyed and damage can entirely disable a ship's ability to manoeuvre or eventually sink it. The types of ammunition can be used during a battle are grapeshot, chain-shot and round shot, which have different uses, from killing enemy crew to disabling enemy movement. As battles progress, crews <b>can</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> board enemy vessels and fight hand-to-hand {{in an attempt to}} capture the ship. The weather in a naval battle is also important; bad weather can create poor visibility. Ships cannot be repaired in mid-battle unlike its successor, , but fires on board ships can be put out automatically.|$|E

25|$|Upselling {{and cross}} selling are {{sometimes}} known as suggestive selling. When the consumer has selected their main purchase, sales assistants <b>can</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> sell the customer on a premium brand or higher quality item (up-selling) or can suggest complementary purchases (cross-selling). For instance, if a customer purchases a non-stick frypan, the sales assistant might suggest plastic slicers {{that do not}} damage the non-stick surface.|$|E

25|$|So, {{instead of}} proving that all {{positive}} integers {{eventually lead to}} 1, we <b>can</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> prove that 1 leads to all positive integers. For any integer n, n ≡ 1 (mod 2) iff 3n+1≡4(mod6). Equivalently, (n−1)/3≡1(mod2) iff n≡4(mod6). Conjecturally, this inverse relation forms a tree except for the 1–2–4 loop (the inverse of the 1–4–2 loop of the unaltered function f defined in the Statement of the problem section of this article).|$|E

25|$|Given {{the proper}} {{environment}} and care, a Komondor is a responsible, loving dog. They are devoted and calm without being sluggish. As in any breed, there {{is quite a}} range of personalities, so your needs should be outlined clearly to your breeder. An experienced breeder <b>can</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> identify that personality which would be happier as an independent livestock dog, or that which wants more to please and would make a good obedience dog or family pet. Adolescence can be marked by changes in a Komondor's temperament, eating habits, trainability and general attitude.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of the Lord's Taverners and the involvement of early members can be broadly summarised by the following:"We've all got professional and sporting interests in common. So why not start a club, based at the beloved old tavern here. We can talk about our work and watch the cricket. And we <b>can</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> put a few bob back into the game at the same time."Since its inception, the Lord's Taverners has developed into a membership charity. For the first fifteen years, the NPFA was the sole beneficiary of the Lord's Taverners, with the money all going to cricket projects, mostly for the installation of artificial pitches.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, the U.S. {{government}} uncovered {{an attempt}} to form a cartel in the heavy electric equipment industry. It charged 13 companies, including {{the largest in the}} industry (Westinghouse, General Electric, and Allis-Chalmers), with price fixing and bid rigging. Most feigned innocence, but Allis-Chalmers pleaded guilty. Although one motive for the forming of cartels is so that amply profitable firms <b>can</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> become obscenely profitable, it did not apply in this instance, according to Buescher; rather, his view of the attempt at a heavy-electrical cartel was that it was a desperate (and foolish) attempt to turn red ink to black ink among fierce competition.|$|E

25|$|Financial {{services}} such as banking and insurance use applications of predictive analytics for churn modeling, because customer retention {{is an essential part}} of most financial services' business models. Other sectors have also discovered the power of predictive analytics, including retailing, telecommunications and pay-TV operators. One of the main objectives of modeling customer churn is to determine the causal factors, so that the company <b>can</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> prevent the attrition from happening in the future. Some companies want to prevent their good customers from deteriorating (e.g., by falling behind in their payments) and becoming less profitable customers, so they introduced the notion of partial customer churn.|$|E
25|$|After the bug is reproduced, {{the input}} of the program {{may need to be}} {{simplified}} {{to make it easier to}} debug. For example, a bug in a compiler can make it crash when parsing some large source file. However, after simplification of the test case, only few lines from the original source file can be sufficient to reproduce the same crash. Such simplification can be made manually, using a divide-and-conquer approach. The programmer will try to remove some parts of original test case and check if the problem still exists. When debugging the problem in a GUI, the programmer <b>can</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> skip some user interaction from the original problem description and check if remaining actions are sufficient for bugs to appear.|$|E
25|$|Rank {{and status}} are fixed from birth. There {{is no way}} in Tongan society to climb up in rank. A low ranking chief will always remain the lesser of a high ranking chief, even though his lands may be bigger and richer and so forth. But he <b>can</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> marry a high ranking woman, for {{instance}} if she is interested in his rich lands, and so increase the rank of his children. Status on the other hand, although usually fixed too, can have some vertical movement. The second son of a noble, normally not in line for his father's title, may get it after all if his older brother dies prematurely. In addition to this sometimes, but very rarely, the king may elevate some person to high status.|$|E

25|$|A {{growing concern}} {{regarding}} plastic {{pollution in the}} marine ecosystem {{is the use of}} microplastics. Microplastics are little beads of plastic less than 5 millimeters wide, and they are commonly found in hand soaps, face cleansers, and other exfoliators. When these products are used, the microplastics go through the water filtration system and into the ocean, but because of their small size they are likely to escape capture by the preliminary treatment screens on wastewater plants. These beads are harmful to the organisms in the ocean, especially filter feeders, because they can easily ingest the plastic and become sick. The microplastics are such a concern because it is difficult to clean them up due to their size, so humans <b>can</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> avoid using these harmful plastics by purchasing products that use natural, environmentally safe exfoliates.|$|E
25|$|The 4–1–3–2 is a {{variation}} of the 4–1–2–1–2 and features a strong and talented defensive centre midfielder. This allows the remaining three midfielders to play farther forward and more aggressively, and also allows them to pass back to their defensive mid when setting up a play or recovering from a counterattack. The 4–1–3–2 gives a strong presence in the forward middle of the pitch and is considered to be an attacking formation. Opposing teams with fast wingers and strong passing abilities <b>can</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> overwhelm the 4–1–3–2 with fast attacks on the wings of the pitch before the three offensive midfielders can fall back to help their defensive line. Valeriy Lobanovskiy {{is one of the most}} famous exponents of the formation, using it with Dynamo Kyiv, winning three European trophies in the process. Another example of the 4–1–3–2 in use was the England national team at the 1966 World Cup, managed by Alf Ramsey.|$|E

Yet he doesn't make good records because what he plays is totally lost {{in the context of this}} band's music. Then there are guitar players like Chet Atkins, who weren't out there trying to show themselves off as guitarists per se, but were using the guitar as a tool to make good records. I remember loving Chet's work when I was a kid, but it was only later, when I really listened to his guitar parts, that I realized how much they were a part of the song's fabric, and how much you'd be going 'Oh, that song just isn't working' if they weren't there.|$|E
