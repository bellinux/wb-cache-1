50|$|Homocitrulline is one {{methylene}} group {{longer than}} citrulline, but similar in structure. The metabolite is generated from a lysine residue after lysine reacts with cyanate. Cyanate {{is present in}} the human body in equilibrium with urea. Under physiological conditions the urea concentration may be too low to allow extensive <b>carbamylation.</b> However, the conversion process leading to the formation of homocitrulline from lysine in proteins is known to occur in vivo. During renal failure conditions, the urea concentration increases and <b>carbamylation</b> of many proteins can occur, which can be detected. It is believed that most <b>carbamylation</b> takes place during inflammation when the enzyme myeloperoxidase is released from neutrophils. This enzyme converts thiocyanate to cyanate. Increased levels of cyanate can now carbamylate lysine residues.|$|E

50|$|Myeloperoxidase {{released}} from neutrophils converts thiocyanate to cyanate which carbamylates lysine residues to form homocitrulline. Thiocyanate (SCN−) is a naturally occurring pseudohalide found in dietary sources. Myeloperoxidase can use SCN− as a cosubstrate together with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to form cyanate. In patients with kidney dysfunction urea is elevated. Urea is in equilibrium with cyanate and isocyanate. <b>Carbamylation</b> of nucleophilic amino groups, for example lysine residues, can modify protein structures and ultimately cause metabolic dysfunctions.|$|E

50|$|The enzyme RuBisCo {{has its own}} {{activation}} process, {{which involves}} a more complex process. It is necessary that a specific lysine amino acid be carbamylated in order to activate the enzyme. This lysine binds to RuBP and leads to a non-functional state if left uncarbamylated. A specific activase enzyme, called RuBisCo activase, helps this <b>carbamylation</b> process by removing one proton from the lysine and making the binding of the carbon dioxide molecule possible. Even then the RuBisCo enzyme is not yet functional, as it needs a magnesium ion to be bound to the lysine in order to function. This magnesium ion is released from the thylakoid lumen when the inner pH drops due to the active pumping of protons from the electron flow. RuBisCo activase itself is activated by increased concentrations of ATP in the stroma caused by its phosphorylation.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinctive}} quality of dibucaine {{is that its}} enzyme inhibition of the wild type butyrylcholinesterase (Typical) is substantially {{greater than that of}} the mutant butyrylcholinesterase (Atypical). Thus, the atypical enzyme is said to be resistant to dibucaine inhibition. This can be used to distinguish individuals in the aforementioned genetic classes. Lockridge and La Du measured atypical and usual human serum cholinesterases with the fluorescent probe, N-methyl-(7-dimethylcarbamoxy)quinolinium iodide. Four active sites per tetramer were found in each enzyme. The turnover numbers of usual and atypical cholinesterases were the same: 15,000 mumol of benzoylcholine hydrolyzed/min/mumol of active site; 48,000 min-1 for o-nitrophenylbutyrate; and 0.0025 min-1 for N-methyl-(7-dimethylcarbamoxy)quinolinium iodide. They had identical rate constants for <b>carbamylation,</b> (5.0 min-1) and for decarbamylation (0.15 h-1). The major difference between the two genetically determined forms of the enzyme was substrate affinity, KD being 0.16 mM for usual and 5.4 mM for atypical cholinesterase, for the fluorescent probe substrate. Km for the uncharged ester, o-nitrophenylbutyrate, was 0.14 mM for both enzymes, whereas Km for benzoylcholine was 0.005 mM for usual and 0.024 mM for atypical cholinesterase. We interpret these data to mean that the two enzymes differ only in the structure of their anionic site.|$|E

[...] Residual syndrome is a non-life-threatening disease which is displayed as toxic effects causing many of the same signs and symptoms that uremia displays. There are several hypotheses why residual syndrome is present. They are: (1) the accumulation of large molecular weight solutes that are poorly dialyzed (e.g. β2-Microglobulin), (2) the accumulation of protein-bound small molecular weight solutes that are poorly dialyzed (e.g. ρ-cresol sulfate and indoxyl sulfate), (3) accumulation of dialyzable solutes that are incompletely removed (e.g. sequestered solutes like phosphate in cells or insufficient elimination of other more toxic solutes), (4) indirect phenomena such as <b>carbamylation</b> of proteins, tissue calcification, or a toxic effect of hormone imbalance (e.g. Parathyroid hormone) and (5) the toxic effect by dialysis itself (e.g. removal of unknown important vitamins or minerals). Dialysis increases life span but patients may have more limited function. They gain physical limitations which include impairment of balance, walking speed and sensory functions. They also retain cognitive impairment such as impairment in attention, memory and performance of higher-order tasks. Patients have been maintained longer than three decades on dialysis, but unfortunately average mortality rates and hospitalizations are high. Also patient rehabilitation and quality of life is poor.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Smoking {{has been}} {{connected}} to citrullination of antigens and formation of anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Since smoking can modify proteins by <b>carbamylation</b> (formation of homocitrulline), {{this study was}} conducted to investigate these effects on vimentin in animal models and RA. METHODS: The efficiency of enzymatic <b>carbamylation</b> of vimentin was characterised. B-cell response was investigated after immunisation of rabbits with different vimentin isoforms. Effects of tobacco smoke exposure on <b>carbamylation</b> of vimentin and formation of autoantibodies were analysed in mice. The antibody responses against isoforms of vimentin were characterised with respect to disease duration and smoking status of patients with RA. RESULTS: Enzymatic <b>carbamylation</b> of vimentin was efficiently achieved. Subsequent citrullination of vimentin was not disturbed by homocitrullination. Sera from rabbits immunised with carbamylated vimentin (carbVim), in addition to carbVim also recognised human IgG-Fc showing rheumatoid factor-like reactivity. Smoke-exposed mice contained detectable amounts of carbVim and developed a broad immune response against carbamylated antigens. Although the prevalence of anti-carbamylated antibodies in smokers and non-smokers was similar, the titres of carbamylated antibodies were significantly increased in sera of smoking compared with non-smoking RA. CarbVim antibodies were observed independently of ACPAs in early phases of disease and double-positive patients for anti-mutated citrullinated vimentin (MCV) and anti-carbVim antibodies showed an extended epitope recognition pattern towards MCV. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Carbamylation</b> of vimentin is inducible by cigarette smoke exposure. The polyclonal immune response against modified antigens in patients with RA is not exclusively citrulline-specific and <b>carbamylation</b> of antigens could be involved in the pathogenesis of disease.

The present study focused upon an in vitro/in vivo investigation of the <b>carbamylation</b> of erythrocyte membrane cytoskeletal and phospholipid components. The time course binding pattern of 14 C cyanate to the individual cytoskeletal membrane proteins demonstrated that spectrin and ankyrin were the most extensively carbamylated proteins, incorporating 18. 3 ± 1. 6 and 10. 7 ± 3 mol cyanate/mol protein, respectively, following a 10 -h incubation.

The level of <b>carbamylation</b> was compared with catalytic activity during assay conditions in which activity was both increasing and decreasing. <b>Carbamylation</b> level was measured using the reaction-intermediate analogue 2 ′ -carboxy-D-arabinitol- 1, 5 -bisphosphate (carboxyarabinitol-P 2). A dual isotope procedure was used in which [3 H]carboxyarabinitol-P 2 measured total active sites and 14 CO 2 reported the level of <b>carbamylation.</b> The efficacy of the procedure was verified both in the presence {{and in the absence of}} the substrate d-ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate (ribulose-P 2). These measurements showed that changes in activity during assays were not correlated with <b>carbamylation</b> status. Inactivation during assays initiated with both fully and partially carbamylated enzyme was not associated with any change in <b>carbamylation</b> level. This implies that the loss of activity during assays is not due to ribulose-P 2 binding and sequestering the E form of the enzyme. Ribulose-P 2 did not appear to alter the equilibrium between carbamylated and uncarbamylated enzyme, but it did slow the rate at which enzyme was both decarbamylated and carbamylated.

40|$|<b>Carbamylation</b> (carbamoylation) is a post-translational {{modification}} {{resulting from the}} nonenzymatic reaction between isocyanic acid and free functional groups of proteins, in particular with the free amino groups. This reaction alters structural and functional properties of proteins and results in faster aging of proteins. Urea present in the body can be transformed into cyanate and its more reactive form, isocyanic acid. High concentration of urea is associated with some diseases, especially with chronic renal failure and atherosclerosis. In human tissues, urea and cyanate are in equilibrium in aqueous solutions. Surprisingly, concentration of isocyanate in the body is much lower than it would appear from the kinetic parameters of urea decomposition.

40|$|<b>Carbamylation</b> and citrullination {{are both}} post-translational {{modifications}} against which (auto) antibodies {{can be detected}} in sera of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. <b>Carbamylation</b> is the chemical modification of a lysine into a homocitrulline, whereas citrullination is an enzymatic conversion of an arginine into a citrulline. It is difficult {{to distinguish between the}} two resulting amino acids due to similarities in structure. However, differentiation between citrulline and homocitrulline is important to understand the antigens that induce antibody production and to determine which modified antigens are present in target tissues. We have observed in literature that conclusions are frequently drawn regarding the citrullination or <b>carbamylation</b> of proteins based on reagents that are not able to distinguish between these two modifications. Therefore, we have analyzed a wide spectrum of methods and describe here which method we consider most optimal to distinguish between citrulline and homocitrulline. We have produced several carbamylated and citrullinated proteins and investigated the specificity of (commercial) antibodies by both ELISA and western blot. Furthermore, detection methods based on chemical modifications, such as the anti-modified citrulline-"Senshu" method and also mass spectrometry were investigated for their capacity to distinguish between <b>carbamylation</b> and citrullination. We observed that some antibodies are able to distinguish between <b>carbamylation</b> and citrullination, but an overlap in reactivity is often present in the commercially available anti-citrulline antibodies.

In vitro experiments and clinical studies have suggested the potential involvement of carbamylated proteins (CPs) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) complications like atherosclerosis, but their metabolic fate in vivo is still unknown. To address this issue, we evaluated protein <b>carbamylation</b> in the plasma and tissues of control and 75 % nephrectomised C 57 BL/ 6 J mice by LC-MS/MS assay of homocitrulline, the major carbamylation-derived product (CDP). A basal level of <b>carbamylation</b> was evidenced under all conditions, showing that <b>carbamylation</b> is a physiological process of protein modification in vivo. CP plasma concentrations increased in nephrectomized vs. control mice over the 20 weeks of the experiment (e. g. 335 ± 43 vs. 167 ± 19 μmol homocitrulline/mol lysine (p< 0. 001) 20 weeks after nephrectomy). Simultaneously, CP content increased roughly by two-fold in all tissues throughout the experiment. The progressive accumulation of CPs was specifically noted in long-lived extracellular matrix proteins, especially collagen (e. g. 1264 ± 123 vs. 726 ± 99 μmol homocitrulline/mol lysine (p< 0. 01) in the skin of nephrectomized vs. control mice after 20 weeks of evolution).

Sensing of pH has been proposed as a sufficient proxy for determination of PCO 2 and direct CO 2 -sensing largely discounted. Here we show that connexin 26 (Cx 26) hemichannels, causally linked to respiratory chemosensitivity, are directly modulated by CO 2. A ‘carbamylation motif’, present in CO 2 -sensitive connexins (Cx 26, Cx 30, Cx 32) but absent from a CO 2 -insensitive connexin (Cx 31), comprises Lys 125 and four further amino acids that orient Lys 125 towards Arg 104 of the adjacent subunit of the connexin hexamer. Introducing the <b>carbamylation</b> motif into Cx 31 created a mutant hemichannel (mCx 31) that was opened by increases in PCO 2. Mutation of the <b>carbamylation</b> motif in Cx 26 and mCx 31 destroyed CO 2 sensitivity. Course-grained computational modelling of Cx 26 demonstrated that the proposed carbamate bridge between Lys 125 and Arg 104 biases the hemichannel to the open state. <b>Carbamylation</b> of Cx 26 introduces a new transduction principle for physiological sensing of CO 2...|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Histones {{are highly}} basic {{proteins}} which when digested by trypsin {{are hard to}} analyze using mass spectrometry. Because histones are basic nuclear proteins, a nuclei prep followed by acid extraction is the best purification strategy to increase overall abundance of purified histones. Blocking the lysine residues and cleaving with trypsin is a useful technique to increase detection of histone peptides using MudPIT. In particular, <b>carbamylation</b> and propionylation are the best two methods to block lysine residues. Using both propionylation and <b>carbamylation</b> along with no treatment {{has been shown to}} increase the identification of unmodified and modified histone peptides when coupled with MudPIT analysis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Carbamylation</b> {{is widely}} quoted {{as being a}} problem in 2 -D gel {{analysis}} and the associated sample preparation steps. This modification occurs when iso-cyanate, a urea break-down product, covalently modifies lysine residues, thus inducing a change in isoelectric point. Urea is used at up to 9 M concentrations in sample preparation and 2 -D gels because {{of its ability to}} disrupt protein structure and effect denaturation without the need for ionic surfactants such as SDS. We have studied <b>carbamylation</b> using 7 M urea and 2 M thiourea, under a range of experimental temperatures to establish when, and if, it occurs {{and what can be done}} to minimize the modification. The actual time required for protein extraction from a tissue is usually short compared to the time required for procedures such as reduction and alkylation and IPG rehydration and focusing. Therefore, it is the temperature during these post-extraction procedures that is the most critical factor. Our experiments have shown that <b>carbamylation</b> does not occur during electrophoresis in the presence of urea, even with prolonged run-times. However, under poorly controlled sample preparation and storage conditions, it can become a major event...|$|E
40|$|DNA Alkylation {{is thought}} to be the reason for the {{efficacy}} of lomustine while <b>carbamylation</b> has been implicated as the cause for the side effects seen with lomustine treatment such as hepatotoxicity. In the alkylation study we show that lomustine and its metabolites form similar levels of the DNA adducts N 7 hydroxyethylguanine and O 6 hydroxyethyldeoxyguanosine. In terms of <b>carbamylation,</b> lomustine showed greater extent of <b>carbamylation</b> in the canine hepatocytes and lymphoma cell lines. The DNA repair enzyme O 6 methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) causes resistance of tumor cells to bifunctional nitrosourea, like lomustine. There is no data available regarding MGMT expression/activity in canine cells or tissues. Our study shows that there is low MGMT activity in the canine lymphoid cell line 17 – 71 while the GL- 1 cells did not show any detectable enzyme activity or mRNA expression. The MGMT enzyme activity measured in canine hepatocytes is about 250 – 350 fmol/mg protein as compared to about 90 fmol/mg protein in 17 – 71 cells. We also show that MGMT mRNA expression in 17 – 71 cells and canine hepatocytes positively correlates with its enzyme activity in these cells...|$|E
40|$|To function, the {{catalytic}} {{sites of}} Rubisco (EC 4. 1. 1. 39) {{need to be}} activated by the reversible <b>carbamylation</b> of a lysine residue within the sites followed by rapid binding of magnesium. The activation of Rubisco in vivo requires {{the presence of the}} regulatory protein Rubisco activase. This enzyme is thought to aid the release of sugar phosphate inhibitors from Rubisco's catalytic sites, thereby influencing <b>carbamylation.</b> In C 3 species, Rubisco operates in a low CO 2 environment, which is suboptimal for both catalysis and <b>carbamylation.</b> In C 4 plants, Rubisco is located in the bundle sheath cells and operates in a high CO 2 atmosphere close to saturation. To explore the role of Rubisco activase in C 4 photosynthesis, activase levels were reduced in Flaveria bidentis, a C 4 dicot, by transformation with an antisense gene directed against the mRNA for Rubisco activase. Four primary transformants with very low activase levels were recovered. These plants and several of their segregating T 1 progeny required high CO 2 (> 1 kPa) for growth. They had very low CO 2 assimilation rates at high light and ambient CO 2, and only 10 % to 15 % of Rubisco sites were carbamylated at both ambient and very high CO 2. The amount of Rubisco was similar to that of wild-type plants. Experiments with the T 1 progeny of these four primary transformants showed that CO 2 assimilation rate and Rubisco <b>carbamylation</b> were severely reduced in plants with less than 30 % of wild-type levels of activase. We conclude that activase activity is essential for the operation of the C 4 photosynthetic pathway...|$|E
40|$|Carbamylated low-density {{lipoprotein}} induces death of endothelial cells: A link to atherosclerosis {{in patients with}} kidney disease. BackgroundThe presence of accelerated atherosclerosis in patients with kidney disease cannot be entirely explained by traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Exposure to urea, which is normally present in human blood plasma and elevated in patients with kidney disease, leads to the <b>carbamylation</b> of proteins. We postulated that {{low-density lipoprotein}} (LDL) carbamylated by urea has biologic effects relevant to atherosclerosis. MethodsTo produce carbamylated LDL (cLDL), human native LDL (nLDL) was chemically modified in vitro by exposure to potassium cyanate. Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) and human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CASMCs) were treated in vitro with cLDL or nLDL. Irreversible cell death was measured using the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, apoptosis was assessed by annexin V binding, and proliferation was determined using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. Total plasma protein <b>carbamylation</b> and plasma cLDL were measured in hemodialysis patients using the homocitrulline assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ResultsOur studies demonstrated that cLDL but not nLDL induced dose-dependent vascular cell injuries relevant to atherosclerosis, which included the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cell death. Under light microscopy, endothelial cells treated with cLDL showed signs of morphologic alterations. The injury to endothelial cells measured by LDH release was time-dependent and correlated with the degree of LDL <b>carbamylation.</b> At least {{a part of the}} endothelial cell population treated with cLDL died by apoptosis. In patients with advanced renal disease on hemodialysis, total plasma protein <b>carbamylation</b> and plasma cLDL were several times higher than in control healthy individuals. ConclusionCollectively these data suggest the potential role of carbamylated LDL in accelerated atherosclerosis in patients with chronic renal disease and, possibly, in healthy individuals...|$|E
40|$|Cyanate, {{which is}} in {{equilibrium}} with urea, combines with the α-amino group of the aminoterminal valine of hemoglobin in an irreversible, specific <b>carbamylation</b> reaction. Partial <b>carbamylation</b> (0. 72 residues/hemoglobin tetramer) as determined by cyanate- 14 C incorporation or hydantoin analysis diminishes the in vitro sickling phenomenon. Since cyanate may react not only with hemoglobin but also with functional groups of other red blood cell proteins, the in vitro effect of cyanate was studied on sickle cells. Cells were incubated with 10 mM KCl (control) or 10 mM KNCO (carbamylated) for 1 hr, washed, and resuspended in autologous plasma. Glycolysis, ATP and 2, 3 -diphosphoglyceric acid (DPG) stability, autohemolysis, and osmotic fragility were not affected by <b>carbamylation.</b> Potassium loss in carbamylated cells (2. 8 mmol/liter) was less than in control cells (9. 0 mmol/liter). Pyruvate kinase activity of carbamylated cells was decreased (∼ 25 %) but the activities of other glycolytic enzymes {{were similar to those}} of control cells. Oxygen affinity of carbamylated sickle, normal, and DPG-depleted normal cells increased, and was a sensitive index of the degree and duration of reaction with cyanate. The reactivity of carbamylated cells to DPG was similar to control cells. DPG-depleted carbamylated cells regenerated DPG and increased the P 50 when incubated with pyruvate, inosine, and phosphate. The Bohr effect of normal and of sickle cells was not affected (Δlog P 50 /Δ pH=- 0. 48 and - 0. 53, respectively) after <b>carbamylation.</b> The reserve buffering capacity of plasma offset the slightly diminished (∼ 15 %) CO 2 capacity of carbamylated cells so that whole blood CO 2 capacity, pH, and PCO 2 were normal. These studies provide further support for the potential clinical use of cyanate in treating and preventing the anemia and painful crises of sickle cell disease...|$|E
