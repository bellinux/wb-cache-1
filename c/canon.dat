The historian Mark Philpott, however, argues that St-Calais was knowledgeable in <b>canon</b> law, since he owned a copy of one of the basis of <b>canon</b> law, the False Decretals.

5000|$|When, in {{and after}} the 11th century, the various congregations of <b>Canons</b> Regular were formed, and adopted the Rule of St. Augustine, they were usually called Canonici Regulares Ordinis S.

50|$|Also {{known as}} <b>canons</b> of construction, <b>canons</b> give common sense {{guidance}} to courts {{in interpreting the}} meaning of statutes. Most <b>canons</b> emerge from the common law process through the choices of judges. Proponents {{of the use of}} <b>canons</b> argue that the <b>canons</b> constrain judges and limit the ability of the courts to legislate from the bench. Critics argue that a judge always has a choice between competing <b>canons</b> that lead to different results, so judicial discretion is only hidden through the use of <b>canons,</b> not reduced.|$|R

5|$|The <b>canon</b> {{itself is}} a mix of {{previous}} Daoist traditions, combining features from the Shangqing School and the Celestial Masters, along with other ancient texts and even some Buddhist ideas. The two most important texts of the <b>canon</b> besides the Wufujing are the Red Book of Five Writings (Chi shu wupian) and the Scripture of Upper Chapters on Limitless Salvation (Wuliang Duren Shangpin). According to Lu Xiujing, who edited the Lingbao <b>Canon,</b> there were a total of 34 texts in the <b>canon,</b> of which three have been lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{unity of}} the Gospels is further {{emphasised}} by the decoration of the Eusebian <b>canon</b> tables. The <b>canon</b> tables themselves inherently illustrate the {{unity of the}} Gospels by organising corresponding passages from the Gospels. The Eusebian <b>canon</b> tables normally require twelve pages. In the Book of Kells, the makers of the manuscript planned for twelve pages (folios 1v through 7r) but for unknown reasons, condensed them into ten, leaving folios 6v and 7r blank. This condensation rendered the <b>canon</b> tables unusable. The decoration of the first eight pages of the <b>canon</b> tables is heavily influenced by early Gospel Books from the Mediterranean, where it was traditional to enclose the tables within an arcade (as seen in the London <b>Canon</b> Tables). The Kells manuscript presents this motif in an Insular spirit, where the arcades are not seen as architectural elements but rather become stylised geometric patterns with Insular ornamentation. The four evangelist symbols occupy the spaces under and above the arches. The last two <b>canon</b> tables are presented within a grid. This presentation is limited to Insular manuscripts and was first seen in the Book of Durrow.|$|E
5|$|Almost all of Josquin's motets {{use some}} kind of {{compositional}} constraint on the process; they are not freely composed. Some of them use a cantus firmus as a unifying device; some are canonic; some use a motto which repeats throughout; some use several of these methods. The motets that use <b>canon</b> can be roughly divided into two groups: those in which the <b>canon</b> is plainly designed to be heard and appreciated as such, and another group in which a <b>canon</b> is present, but almost impossible to hear, and seemingly written to be appreciated by the eye, and by connoisseurs.|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} part the <b>canons</b> also speedily became non-resident, and this led to the {{distinction}} of residentiary and non-residentiary <b>canons,</b> till in most churches the number of resident <b>canons</b> became definitely limited in number, and the non-residentiary <b>canons,</b> who no longer shared in the common funds, became generally known as prebendaries only, although by their non-residence they did not forfeit their position as <b>canons,</b> and retained their votes in chapter like the others.|$|R

Due to political instability and social unrest, the <b>canons</b> and their houses declined. The heart of the congregation had been Fregionaia, where the first reform <b>canons</b> lived.

Currently, the 1983 Code of <b>Canon</b> Law is in effect primarily for the Latin Church. The distinct 1990 Code of Canons for the Eastern Churches (CCEO, after the Latin initials) applies to the autonomous Eastern Catholic Churches.|$|E

This ancient order is made up of nine independent congregations confederated internationally in 1959, and the Confederation of <b>Canons</b> Regular of St Augustine elects an Abbot Primate. They have houses in Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, the Dominican Republic, England, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Peru, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tanzania, and Uruguay. The different congregation include: The <b>Canons</b> Regular of St. John Lateran, the Austrian Congregation of <b>Canons</b> Regular, based in the ancient abbeys of Herzogenburg, Klosterneuburg, Neustift, Reichersberg, Sankt Florian, Vorau and Neustift that look after over 100 parishes in Austria and South Tyrol (Italy), the <b>Canons</b> Regular of the Immaculate Conception, The <b>Canons</b> Regular of St. Victor, The <b>Canons</b> Regular of Great St. Bernard, The <b>Canons</b> Regular of St. Maurice, the <b>Canons</b> Regular of Windesheim, The Brothers of the Common Life, The <b>Canons</b> Regular of Our Lady, Mother of the Redeemer.|$|R
50|$|The Institutio canonicorum Aquisgranensis (the Instruction of <b>canons</b> of Aachen) was a text disseminated in 816 at {{a church}} council {{gathered}} at Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle) by Emperor Louis the Pious, which sought to distinguish <b>canons</b> from monks and to provide <b>canons</b> with a rule, called the Regula canonicorum (Rule of <b>Canons)</b> or Rule of Aix. The Institutio consists of a prologue, a collection of texts from church fathers, and the rule itself. Similar to Chrodegang's Rule (itself at times called the Regula canonicorum), it differed on certain points. It was, for instance, more insistent on <b>canons</b> living a common life, eating and sleeping together (though it still allowed for <b>canons</b> {{to have their own}} houses with their bishop's permission).

This led to the recording and standardisation of legal codes throughout Western Europe. <b>Canon</b> law was also studied, and around 1140 a monk named Gratian (fl. 12th century), a teacher at Bologna, wrote what became the standard text of <b>canon</b> law—the Decretum.|$|E
5|$|Lichton {{was born}} in the diocese of Brechin (probably Angus) somewhere between 1369 and 1379 to Henry and Janet Lichton.

Lichton followed an ecclesiastical career simultaneously with his studies. The first notice of this career comes in 1392, when he was vicar of Markinch in Fife, a vicariate of St Andrews Cathedral Priory. He was a <b>canon</b> of the diocese of Moray by 1394, and Archdeacon of Aberdeen by 1395, holding this position into the following year, 1396.|$|E

Another <b>canon</b> dealt with clandestine marriages and regulated child marriages. He was also heavily involved with trying judicial cases, both in the actual judgment {{as well as in}} the execution of judgments made by others.

Following Alan Gardiner's 1959 study of the <b>canon,</b> scholars such as Nigel Strudwick credited Nyuserre with 11 years of reign. Gardiner's reading of the <b>canon</b> was then reevaluated from facsimiles, yielding a 24 to 25 years figure for Nyuserre's reign. This duration is accepted by some scholars including Nicolas Grimal. More recent analyses of the original papyrus conducted by Kim Ryholt have shown that Nyuserre's reign length as reported on the document could equally be 11–14, 21–24, or 31–34 years. The later figure is now favoured by Egyptologists including Strudwick and Verner.|$|E
