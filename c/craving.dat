The one-mile county road bearing the site's name ("Craver Road") stretches across the original historic site to connect two more recently developed roadways. Historians agree that <b>Craver</b> Road was at first simply a horse trail leading to the then-new farmhouse during the mid-to-late 18th century. Soon afterward, <b>Craver</b> Road became a personal carriageway for the <b>Craver</b> Family as one may think of the modern driveway. The barn located at <b>Craver</b> Farmstead originally served as a private draft horse stable and carriage house for the exclusive use of the <b>Craver</b> family far prior to the advent of the horseless carriage.|$|R

5|$|Topiramate, a {{derivative}} of the naturally occurring sugar monosaccharide D-fructose, {{has been found}} effective in helping alcoholics quit or {{cut back on the}} amount they drink. Evidence suggests that topiramate antagonizes excitatory glutamate receptors, inhibits dopamine release, and enhances inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid function. A 2008 review of the effectiveness of topiramate concluded that the results of published trials are promising, however, as of 2008, data was insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent for alcohol dependence. A 2010 review found that topiramate may be superior to existing alcohol pharmacotherapeutic options. Topiramate effectively reduces <b>craving</b> and alcohol withdrawal severity as well as improving quality-of-life-ratings.|$|E

5|$|The Varaha, in the 83 {{verses of}} Chapter 2, {{explains}} to Ribhu {{how to achieve}} the most exalted knowledge of Brahmavidya, and then what it is. He tells Ribhu that the four means of this knowledge are to practice conduct of one's Varna (caste) and one's Ashrama (stage in life), from ascetic austerity {{and with the help}} of a Guru (spiritual teacher). The Varaha then states that the path to Brahmavidya is through the capacity to distinguish between the ephemeral and the eternal, detachment from the material world unto the spiritual world. A sincere longing for spiritual liberation and six virtuous qualities (shama) are essential in order to achieve Brahmavidya, asserts the Upanishad, these being tranquility, self-restraint, doing work without <b>craving</b> for rewards, endurance, faith, and meditation. Varaha states in verse 2.4 that the truly blessed are those who know Brahman and Atman and have thus become one with them.|$|E

25|$|Dukkha {{arises when}} we crave (Pali: tanha) and cling to these {{changing}} phenomena.
