40|$|The typical leaf-type isosceles-trapezoidal {{flexural}} (LITF) pivot {{consists of}} two flexural beams and two rigid-bodies. The single LITF pivot has the small range of motion and rel-atively large center shift. However, the vacancy in the pivot point makes LITF pivots much easier to be cascaded than other commonly used flexure joints. The performances of LITF pivots will be greatly improved by connecting them together in series. This paper presents an innovative design of LITF pivots. The single LITF pivot {{is regarded as a}} basic <b>configurable</b> <b>module,</b> and four of them can be used to construct new types of flexure joint, which are referred to here as quadri-LITF (Q-LITF) pivot. Ten types of Q-LITF pivots are synthesized in this paper. Compared with a single LIFT pivot, the stroke of a Q-LITF pivot is larger, and stiffness of the mechanism becomes smaller. The center-shift of the Q-LIFT pivot can be optimized by tuning geometric parameters of its single LITF mod-ules. Based on the pseudorigid-body (PRB) model of the single LITF pivot, the method for analyzing the Q-LITF pivots is proposed. One type of the Q-LITF pivots is selected as an example to demonstrate the proposed method for the Q-LITF pivot analysis. The com-parison between the results of PRB model analysis and the finite element analysis (FEA) shows the feasibility and efficiency of the analysis procedure. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4007917]...|$|E
40|$|Changing {{environmental}} conditions often impose stressful growing conditions in plant communities. Until now, morphological plasticity, i. e. polymorphic growth physiognomies of plants, {{has not been}} sufficiently studied as a pivotal strategy for the whole ecosystem adaptation to environmental stress. We consider mangrove ecosystems as suitable models to provide insights on this subject. In the thesis, I investigate the ecological significance of tree morphological plasticity in the structural development and the dynamics of mangrove forests. I conducted field experiments in two regions located {{on both sides of}} the Amazon River mouths i. e. in French Guiana and North Brazil. Forest inventories were carried out in contrasting mangrove stands in both regions. The thesis combines empirical analysis of field data, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and mechanistic, individual-based computer simulations. We published results that proved the TLS-based analysis of individual tree structure useful for a better knowledge on biomass allocation between trunk and branches in tall and large Avicennia germinans mangrove trees reaching 45 m high and 125 cm of trunk diameter. Combining structural descriptions of A. germinans trees found in both sites, I highlighted the site-specific differences in tree allometries. The study suggests that regional differences in mangrove tree structure and function could be captured through better description of crown metrics, and that selected indicators of local morphological plasticity and consequent stand structure could generate a plus-value in the understanding of mangrove stand dynamics across contrasting coastal environments. Beyond the extension of allometric models to large Avicennia trees, we proposed new biomass equations with improved predictive power when crown metrics is taken into account. Additionally, we developed a novel software tool, named Lollymangrove, based on the AMAPStudio suite of software, with the objective of maximizing the potential of further field descriptions and modeling works. Lollymangrove allows standardized forest data capture, 3 D visualization of structural data, aboveground biomass computations from a <b>configurable</b> <b>module</b> and export formats for forest dynamics and remote sensing models. Simulation experiments were conducted by means of the spatially explicit, individual-based stand model BETTINA_IBM. This model describes the important mechanism of water uptake limited by salt stress, and revealed insights into the relation between {{environmental conditions}}, allometric variations and biomass partitioning of mangrove trees, and stand characteristics. The simulation results suggest close matches with observed ecological patterns (e. g., tree allometries, mortality distributions, and self-thinning trajectories) under higher salinity. In low salinity conditions, however, the current parameterization underestimates the maximum tree height and diameter, and consequently, aboveground biomass and self-thinning trajectories of forest stands. This suggests that the morphology of trees under low levels of salinity are explained by further regulation mechanism(s) that still need to be addressed in a subsequent model improvement. Overall, this work has essentially pointed out the need to elucidate how morphological plasticity relates with structural development of forest stands. It establishes that TLS measurements and structural data analysis associated to efforts for integrative software and mechanistic modelling works could link mangrove dynamics to fast-changing coastal processes...|$|E

It is a modular system using a commercially available time-triggered protocol, ?Tp/C, that supports hard real-time distributed control systems independent of the data transmission medium. The protocol is implemented in hardware and provides guaranteed low-latency messaging with inherent fault-tolerance and fault-containment.

Although embedded real-time systems have long been prevailing in our society, no firm scientific base has been established yet to handle timing requirements in a systematic manner in real-time embedded computing. Because of this lack of the scientific base, many embedded systems have been designed in an ad hoc manner and most of them have been customized to specific applications, showing inflexibility for the other type of applications. This paper proposes a dynamically reconfigurable embedded architecture which bridges the gap between the embedded system and ASICs. This architecture combines a reconfigurable hardware processing unit with a software programmable processor. The main goal is {{to take advantage of the}} capabilities of both resources. While the processor takes care of all sequential computations the reconfigurable hardware takes specialized vector operations. With such integrated system architecture, specific properties of applications, such as parallelism, regularity of computation and data granularity can be exploited by creating custom operators, pipelines and interconnection pathways.
