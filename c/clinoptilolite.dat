The experiment indicated that <b>clinoptilolite</b> had a characteristic of “rapid adsorption, slow equilibrium”, it took 3 hours to reach adsorption equilibrium, clinoptilolite's particle size, moisture content and dosage had important effects on saturation adsorption time and ammonia adsorption capacity. With decreasing the particle size, <b>clinoptilolite</b> adsorption capacity increased, and the higher ammonia concentration, the better adsorption effect in the “rapid adsorption” phase. Different clinoptilolite's moistures also {{played an important role}} for adsorption effect, in the “rapid adsorption” phase, the effect was the best when moisture content of <b>clinoptilolite</b> was 40 %; in the phase of “slow equilibrium”, wet <b>clinoptilolite</b> adsorption would be better than the natural, the rank was: 40 %> 50 %> 30 %> 20 %> 60 %>the natural.

The adsorption isotherms of these surfactants are {{correlated with the}} z potential curves of <b>clinoptilolite.</b> Accordingly, {{the applicability of the}} hemimicelle hypothesis to the adsorption of cationic surfactants at the clinoptilolite/water interface considering in the electrical double layer (EDL) of <b>clinoptilolite</b> is discussed. Even though the adsorption occurs in the EDL of <b>clinoptilolite,</b> the adsorption of HDTMA, TDTMA and DDTMA onto <b>clinoptilolite</b> is not conveniently described by the hemimicelle hypothesis. The absence of all expected marked increase in the z potential curves at the hemimicelle concentration is ascribed to the large external cation exchange capacity of <b>clinoptilolite.</b> The hydrocarbon chain length of surfactant molecules is found to {{have a significant effect on}} the ion exchange as well as hydrophobic interaction mechanisms.

The hypothesis was that <b>clinoptilolite</b> had the facility to preferentially and internally sorb NH₄⁺, {{where it would be}} physically protected from microbial nitrification. Hence nitrification rates would be decreased and plant N-fertilizer use efficiency increased. Exchange capacities of <b>clinoptilolite</b> determined at 30 °C by saturation/desorption for NH₄⁺, K⁺ and Na⁺ were approximately 2. 00 moles of charge kg⁻¹, while capacities for Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ were 1. 53 and 0. 97 respectively. On this basis three site groups were identified: those accessible to all cations studied, sites accessible to all cations but Mg²⁺ and sites only accessible to NH₄⁺, K⁺ and Na⁺. Equilibrium isotherms were used to determine selectivity of site groups at 30 °C. Consideration of site accessibilities and selectivities indicate an overall preference of <b>clinoptilolite</b> of: K⁺ > NH₄⁺ > Na⁺ = Ca²⁺ > Mg²⁺. Notably, the plant macronutrient cations, K⁺ and NH₄⁺, are preferentially sorbed. Nitrification of NH₄⁺ on <b>clinoptilolite</b> amended sands incubated at 20 % volumetric moisture capacities, was studied in the laboratory. Treatments were washed mortar sand amended with 0, 5 and 10 % <b>clinoptilolite</b> by volume and 2. 38 and 3. 57 moles of NH₄⁺ m⁻³ of sand-clinoptilolite mix. Nitrification was evaluated by monitoring NH₄⁺ loss. Rates of nitrification decreased with increasing <b>clinoptilolite</b> amendment and decreased with N-fertilizer initially applied. The effect of <b>clinoptilolite</b> in slowing nitrification was more pronounced at higher initial NH₄⁺-fertilizer application. The hypothesis that internally sorbed NH₄⁺ in <b>clinoptilolite</b> is physically protected from microbes resulting in decreased nitrification rates was confirmed.

Overall, the increase in the concentration of nutrients on the <b>clinoptilolite</b> was relatively low, however, nutrients could be removed from the liquid fraction of digestate with high removal efficiencies. This indicated that the use of <b>clinoptilolite</b> could be a solution for improved management and utilization of the liquid fractions of digestate...|$|E
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScThere {{are huge}} amount of natural <b>clinoptilolite</b> {{available}} in South Africa which can be utilised for wastewater treatment of ammonia and chromium if their characteristics are properly known. However, these deposits have not been well characterised but in this study, the untreated <b>clinoptilolite</b> materials were fully characterised using techniques such as SEM-EDS, HRTEM-SAED, XRD, XRF, FTIR and BET. After acid pretreatment with several extractions, the pretreated samples were again characterised using the above mentioned techniques. These pretreated materials were used for NH₄⁺ and Cr³⁺ adsorption of wastewater. The three natural South African <b>clinoptilolite</b> samples {{used in this study}} were from ECCA Holdings (ESC and EHC samples) and Pratley (PC sample) deposits obtained from Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal Province respectively. This study revealed that the chemical composition and mineral phases of South African clinoptilolites vary considerably from site to site, even <b>clinoptilolite</b> mined from the same deposit sites. The XRD analyses showed that Pratley <b>clinoptilolite</b> (PC) was the most pure <b>clinoptilolite</b> sample (81. 41 %) compared to the purity of EHC (67. 88 %) and ESC (44. 0 %) sample. The ECCA Holdings untreated <b>clinoptilolite</b> samples contained dense phases such as quartz which was not found in Pratley sample. Quartz was found to be the most dominant impurity in both ECCA Holding sample. The cation exchange capacity (CEC) of ESC, EHC and PC samples were found to be 1. 23, 1. 81 and 2. 90 meq/g respectively and these results were compared to that of XRF analyses. The acid solutions of 0. 02 and 1. 0 M HCl were used to pretreat natural <b>clinoptilolite</b> to determine the optimum acid concentration and number of extractions required to fully replace the exchangeable cations. The pretreatment results showed that 0. 02 M HCl was the optimum acid concentration for acid pretreatment of <b>clinoptilolite</b> samples. Between 7 and 22 extractions were required to remove Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ without causing much dealumination of the framework. Sodium ion was found to be weakly bound cation in the <b>clinoptilolite</b> framework, since it could be completely exchanged by H⁺ after 7 extractions with 0. 02 M HCl acid solution. Potassium ion was found to be strongly bound in the <b>clinoptilolite</b> framework since it could not be completely exchanged during the acid pretreatment process even after 22 extractions. The HRTEM-SAED and BET results showed that ESC, EHC and PC were all polycrystalline and microporous materials respectively. It was found that the adsorption capacity of the treated Pratley <b>clinoptilolite</b> sample was increased by 36 % for NH₄⁺ removal, compared to that of the untreated PC sample. The adsorption study results showed that the pretreatment of <b>clinoptilolite</b> samples using 150 mL volumes of 0. 02 M HCl with 7 acid extractions at 25 °C for ESC pretreated and EHC pretreated. The pretreatment of PC sample at 22 extractions could remove high percentage of NH₄⁺ (98. 11 %) within a short contact time of 10 min. The pretreated Pratley <b>clinoptilolite</b> sample was found to be the best NH₄⁺ adsorbent (98. 11 % NH₄⁺ removal) compared to EHC treated (93. 89 % NH₄⁺ removal) and ESC treated (75. 00 % NH₄⁺ removal) <b>clinoptilolite</b> samples. However, acid-pretreated Pratley <b>clinoptilolite</b> did not sufficiently remove Cr³⁺ (16. 10 %) from synthetic wastewater showing {{that it is not a}} good adsorbent for this particular metal ion removal. Despite several studies that have been conducted on <b>clinoptilolite,</b> no study has been carried out on the pretreatment and comparison of sorption capacity of different South African clinoptilolites for the removal of NH₄⁺ from wastewater. This study has been able improve on the acid-pretreatment procedure for <b>clinoptilolite.</b> This study demonstrated that it is not only the acid concentration that is important but also the number of extractions needed to remove all the exchangeable cations from the <b>clinoptilolite</b> framework. This study has also been able to prove that South African <b>clinoptilolite</b> can treated ammonia from wastewater...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} ammonium exchange capacity of natural and activated <b>clinoptilolite</b> from Kwazulu-Natal Province, South Africa. X – ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis showed that the <b>clinoptilolite</b> contained exchangeable ions of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. This analysis also confirmed that the zeolite sample had a high silicon composition compared to aluminium. Batch equilibrium studies were performed in an orbital shaker and the data fitted the Langmuir isotherm very well. The ammonium exchange capacity was found to increase with pH and temperature. <b>Clinoptilolite</b> functionalization with hydrochloric acid increased its ammonia uptake ability. Keywords—Activated <b>clinoptilolite,</b> Ammonium exchange...|$|E
