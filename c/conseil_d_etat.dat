It is defined on one side by the restoration ofthe party {{and on the other}} side by the parliamentary election in 1946. The parliamentary election in 1946 ended the first phase of the party' s tactics, whose aim was to infiltrate the state mechanism and, at the same time, the election built optimal conditions for the party to finally eliminate its political enemies and seize absolute power. I have deliberately chosen this demarcation because it takes a key place in the development of the party' s political tactics, and not a period ending in astate coup <b>ď</b> <b>etat</b> in 1948. This approach would have been possible but it might have ended up growing into a simple description in which all the important and relevant matters of the party' s programme and political strategy were left out. The very core ofthis work is made of a post-war policy analysis of The Czechoslovak Communist Party, its historical development in an overall domestic and intemational context. It particularly focuses on the following crucial issues: 1. a post-war restoration of the party; 2. The party's policy in a period ofThe Provisional National Assembly (TPNA); 3.

In the past decade there were huge changes in the media landscape of Pakistan. General Pervez Musharraf who came to power through a military coup <b>d</b> <b>état</b> in 1999 initiated an unprecedented liberalisation process for media in Pakistan. Media has {{played an important role in}} the Pakistani society for good and for worse in the past decade. I have narrowed down my study to the power struggle that unfolded in Pakistan in 2007 that eventually led to Musharraf stepping down. The main research questions of my thesis are how certain parts of the Pakistani media covered the power struggle between Musharraf and judiciary that ultimately led to the resignation of Musharraf as the head of the powerful Pakistani army and what impact media had on the downfall of Musharraf from power. My analysis shows that the Pakistani media was negative to Musharraf s actions. The media openly pointed out and showed Musharraf s mistakes to the public. By doing so media took the role of an accelerator, in which media s coverage led to more unpopularity for Musharraf and thereby removing his political base. Through media, Musharraf was able to see the massive sentiment in the society against him, and he understood that he had to resign as Chief of Army Staff...|$|R
40|$|How does {{regime change}} affect non-state conflicts? Within the broader {{literature}} coup <b>d</b> <b>états,</b> riots and armed conflict {{is linked to}} transition between political regimes. For non-state conflicts {{there is a lack}} of systemic inquire about this topic. To investigate this topic I start by examining how states internal conditions put the contexts where violence becomes more or less likely. I argue that states with non-representative institutions and low state capacity put forth conditions where non-state conflicts are likely to erupt. Further, I investigate how regime change alters this institutional set up. The interplay of a state occupied reorganizing and the potential of a different future provide motivation and opportunity for actors dissatisfied with their current situation. If groups fail to display their importance and leverage in the transition period, stakes might be lost when the emerging regime enters office and politics start to consolidate. Using data on non-state conflicts from 1989 - 2008, I apply a negative binomial regression to test the effect of institutional set up and regime change on non-state conflicts. My analyses suggest a relationship between weak state capacity and non-state conflicts. Depending on choice of indicators, and the sample exposed, representative institutions might be an explanation of non-state conflicts. While I fail to find a general relationship between non-state conflicts and regime change, I find a strong relationship when allowing the indicator of regime change to include cases of state collapse. Year to year changes between political regimes cannot explain non-state conflicts, but long periods without a governing body does...|$|R
40|$|Ghana s {{attainment}} of political independence from British rule on 6 th March, 1957, has experienced four successful military coups <b>d</b> <b>état</b> and numerous attempted coups. All these events occasioned extensive {{human rights violations}} and abuses. The military regimes (and occasionally civilian regimes) provided a platform for heinous and sustained violations of the fundamental human rights and freedoms of many citizens and foreigners resident in Ghana. The security agencies, especially, {{the police and the}} military were mainly responsible for these violations. However, most of these violations and abuses of human rights had not been investigated, officially acknowledged and redressed. As a result, considerable pain, anguish, bitterness and divisions existed in the Ghanaian society. At the heart of this thesis are two fundamental questions: (1) How do we effectively seek and promote national reconciliation, devoid of trials, in a country like Ghana whose past is characterized by politically motivated violent denial of constitutional rule, resulting in gross human rights abuses and violations? (2) What can be done to avoid a relapse into any and all of its retrogressive past? This study argues that, given the troubled past in Ghana s history, the National Reconciliation Commission (NRC) was essentially imperative even after a long democratic dispensation, during which period it all seems over and forgotten but not forgiven. The NRC has played a pivotal role by laying the foundation necessary for reconciling the nation. It also provides a holistic way of re-instituting {{the rule of law and}} reforming institutions to prevent any future relapse into rights violations and abuses. Although imperfect and subject to criticisms, the work of the Ghanaian NRC broaches an important stage in Ghana s process of attempting to understand its past and to make possible reconciliation for the purposes of healing wounds, consolidating its democracy and paving the way for socio-economic development...|$|R

This Article traces and critiques this developing “fair trial” jurisprudence, which has also resulted in the condemnation of the supreme courts of Belgium, Portugal, and the Netherlands, whose decisionmaking procedures were all patterned on the French civil law model. Finally, the Article examines the dramatic and schismatic French responses that have ensued. This Article offers a case study at the intersection of European law, comparative law and judicial theory. It begins by describing—and distinguishing between—the interpretive practices and judicial theories that characterize the legal systems of France, the United States, and the European Union. It then analyzes the complex, multifaceted, and ongoing negotiation between these systems 2 ̆ 7 divergent understandings of proper judicial practice. Professor Lasser concludes that the largely misguided interchange between the French supreme courts and the ECHR may well have resulted in pasteurizing the French civil law procedural model into bland nonexistence. The traditionally republican and institutional modes of French judicial decisionmaking have been forced to take on some of the more democratic and argumentative features that characterize ECHR and, especially, American judicial decisionmaking. Unfortunately, these reforms may grant a new argumentative prominence—and thus normative dominance—to the French judiciary (precisely what the traditional French system was designed to avoid), without, however, counterbalancing this new judicial power with sufficiently effective individual, public, and argumentative judicial accountability. Whether these reforms mark {{the beginning of the end}} or the beginning of a creative new beginning of the French civil law model of judicial decisionmaking remains to be determined...|$|R

The political activities between 1965 und 1978 were mainly focussed on basic reformative goals toward a republican and democratic system in which basic human rights of all inhabitants of the country, independent of their ethnic or economic background, would be respected. A special regard was concentrated on the obvious and objective antagonism of ethnic disparity and inequality in favour of Pashtuns and, in evident disfavor of other ethnic groups as they are uzbeks, hazaras {{and to some extent}} even tajiiks. Activities were directed against the Pashtun ethnic-dominance and elitism in relevant fields of politics, finance, military, police; asking for equal rights of all other ethnicities in Afghanistan. The political organization he led was labeled as Setami Milli (National Oppression) by the royal family and, at the same time, by the [...] "leftist" [...] functionaries, interestingly mainly by Pashtun activists of the [...] "Peoples Democratic Party of Afghanistan". He came because of his opposition to the system into political detention many times in his life, for days, weeks or multiple months: during the times of King Zahir, during the first republic of President Daoud. In the meantime he worked in the Ministry of Education, where he kept working during the regime of Nur Muhammad Taraki after the leftist coup <b>d</b> <b>état</b> in April 1978 too. His cultural work and productivity in terms of writing multiple newspapers, journals and magazines on poetry, prose, philosophy and theology had been documented well, but mostly got lost in the years of the war that came after 1980.

40|$|License Withdrawn A Moral Evaluation of Norwegian Arms Export to Turkey On March 13, 1992, the Norwegian Foreign Ministry granted Raufoss A/S {{a license}} to export {{ammunition}} to Turkey. Two weeks later the Foreign Ministry withdrew the license, and Raufoss A/S was consequently denied the possibility to export. The aim of this thesis is to give a moral evaluation {{of the decision to}} withdraw the license for ammunition. This evaluation is partly based on the question whether it was right to grant the license in the first place. To evaluate the decision to withdraw the license is therefore a way to discuss some of the moral issues involved in arms export. The decision to withdraw the license was made in a situation where the conflict between the banned Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) and Turkish government forces was intense and violent. At the end of 1992, it was announced that over 2, 300 people had been killed on Turkish territory that year. On the basis of a pluralist view of morality, I will evaluate the policy decision on arms export from three different moral perspectives. The three perspectives are utilitarianism, Kantianism, and raison <b>d</b> <b>etat.</b> These theories have different views of what morality consi sts of and which considerations are morally relevant. The first moral perspective, utilitarianism, is a consequentialist theory which accords moral importance to the consequences of decisions on individual well-being. The second theory, Kantianism, is deontological and claims that there are certain restrictions on what we might legitimately do, regardless of the consequences: the morally right action is that which conforms {{to the demands of the}} categorical imperative. The third moral perspective, raison d 'etat, is based on moral partiality and claims that national leaders have a special responsibility toward their own citizens: they should promote the national interest. The discussion will point to and illustrate some of the problems connected with making moral judgments - problems which in some cases may lead to unclear or indeterminate answers. Despite the complexity of reaching moral judgements, however, the conclusion in the case I discuss is quite clear: There were few good reasons for the Norwegian government to grant the license in the first place, and even after the government had made that decision, it was not wrong to withdraw the license...|$|R
40|$|Côte d Ivoire was {{traditionally}} {{perceived as}} one of West Africa s most stable countries. Once admired for its successful combination of economic growth and social development, the country faced a political and economic crisis, culminating on September 19, 2002 with a failed coup <b>d</b> <b>état</b> which turned into a civil war. The country was consequently split in two: the North controlled by the insurrectional forces (Forces Nouvelles) and the South controlled by the government. These two parts were separated by a buffer zone controlled by French forces, the UN (MINUCI) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Due to Côte d Ivoire s central position in West Africa the repercussions were not only limited to Côte d Ivoire, but {{had a significant impact}} on economy and politics throughout the region. Other states, or more correctly networks around and through the states, became involved in the Ivorian crisis, mainly Burkina Faso and Liberia. Many have failed to see the interest of the Burkinabe president Blaise Compaoré in this crisis, arguing that the three million Burkinabe citizens living in Côte d Ivoire and the Burkinabe economy would pay the highest price. The aim of this thesis was to explain the Burkinabe involvement in the Ivorian war. The findings in this thesis show that the nature of the (West) African state enables transnational relations which can constitute a threat to political regimes. Regime security is hence important. Further that these transnational networks make the security of Burkina and Côte d Ivoire are so interlinked that their security problems cannot reasonably be analysed or resolved apart from one another. These states are hence a part of a Regional Security Complex. One of the reasons behind the Burkinabe involvement is hence that both states were a par of a security complex and that the collapsing Ivorian state was a threat to Burkina. The weak economic basis of Burkina might also have led its regime to seek to transnational networks in order to sustain its patrimonial practises. In addition, personal friendship, political leaders personal interest and patron-client relations were important in shaping foreign policies and international politics, and to explain why conflicts in the West Africa become regionalised. This study underlines the importance of the interplay between the national and the regional levels when assessing security dynamics in the region, and calls hence for a regional approach to peace-building which takes into account transnational relations...|$|R
40|$|Dans les systèmes de {{transmission}} multiporteuses et impliquant plusieurs utilisateurs, deux phénomènes viennent perturber la réception et la détection de symboles : le canal de propagation et le décalage des fréquences porteuses (DFP). Cette thèse traite de techniques d égalisation et de synchronisation en fréquence reposant sur des techniques de type Kalman telles que le filtrage de Kalman étendu (EKF) du 1 er ou du 2 nd ordre, le filtrage de Kalman étendu itératif ou le filtrage de Kalman par sigma point (SPKF). Pour relaxer les hypothèses de Gaussianité sur les bruits de mesure et de modèle dans la représentation dans l espace <b>d</b> <b>état,</b> des approches de type H[infini] sont aussi étudiées. Ces méthodes sont ensuite exploitées dans des systèmes de type OFDMA ou OFDM-IDMA et sont combinées avec d autres approches (MMSE-SD, tests statistiques, etc.) pour mettre en œuvre des récepteurs pouvant être notamment robustes à des interférences large bande, comme c est le cas dans des applications de radio intelligence. Multicarrier modulation is {{the common}} feature of high-data rate mobile wirelesssystems. In that case, two phenomena disturb the symbol detection. Firstly,due to the relative transmitter-receiver motion and {{a difference between the}} localoscillator (LO) frequency at the transmitter and the receiver, a carrier frequencyoffset (CFO) affects the received signal. This leads to an intercarrier interference(ICI). Secondly, several versions of the transmitted signal are received due to thewireless propagation channel. These unwanted phenomena must be taken intoaccount when designing a receiver. As estimating the multipath channel and theCFO is essential, this PhD deals with several CFO and channel estimation methodsbased on optimal filtering. Firstly, as the estimation issue is nonlinear, we suggest using the extended Kalmanfilter (EKF). It is based on a local linearization of the equations around the laststate estimate. However, this approach requires a linearization based on calculationsof Jacobians and Hessians matrices and may not be a sufficient descriptionof the nonlinearity. For these reasons, we can consider the sigma-point Kalmanfilter (SPKF), namely the unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and the central differenceKalman filter (CDKF). The UKF is based on the unscented transformationwhereas the CDKF is based on the second order Sterling polynomial interpolationformula. Nevertheless, the above methods require an exact and accurate apriori system model as well as perfect knowledge of the additive measurementnoisestatistics. Therefore, we propose to use the H filtering, which is known tobe more robust to uncertainties than Kalman filtering. As the state-space representationof the system is non-linear, we first evaluate the extended H filter,which is based on a linearization of the state-space equations like the EKF. As analternative, the unscented H filter, which has been recently proposed in theliterature, is implemented by embedding the unscented transformation into the extended H filter and carrying out the filtering by using the statistical linearerror propagation approach. The above techniques have been implemented in different multicarrier contexts:Firstly, we address the estimation of the multiple CFOs and channels by meansof a control data in an uplink orthogonal frequency division multiple access(OFDMA) system. To reduce the amount of control data, the optimal filteringtechniques are combined in an iterative way with the so-called minimum meansquare error successive detector (MMSE-SD) to obtain an estimator that doesnot require pilot subcarriers.

40|$|Thyroxine-immunofluorescence {{quantitative}} disruption test (TIQDT) {{was designed}} to provide a simple, rapid, alternative bioassay for assessing the potential of chemical pollutants and drugs to disrupt thyroid gland function. This study demonstrated that zebrafish eleutheroembryos provided a suitable vertebrate model, not only for screening the potential thyroid disrupting effect of molecules, but also for estimating the potential hazards associated with exposure to chemicals directly impairing thyroxine (T 4) synthesis. Amitrole, potassium perchlorate, potassium thiocyanate, methimazole (MMI), phloroglucinol, 6 -propyl- 2 -thiouracil, ethylenethiourea, benzophenone- 2, resorcinol, pyrazole, sulfamethoxazole, sodium bromide, mancozeb, and genistein were classified as thyroid gland function disruptors. Concordance between TIQDT on zebrafish and mammalian published data was very high and the physiological relevance of T 4 -intrafollicular content was clearly higher than regulation at the transcriptional level of tg or slc 5 a 5. Moreover, concentration-response analysis provided information about the thyroid disrupting potency and hazard of selected positive compounds. Finally, the effect of perchlorate, but not MMI, was completely rescued by low-micromolar amounts of iodide. TIQDT performed on zebrafish eleutheroembryos is an alternative whole-organism screening assay that provides relevant information for environmental and human risk assessments. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

Participants included Douglas Laycock (University of Virginia), who offered the Conference Introduction; Nathalie Caron (Université Paris-Est Créteil); Blandine Chelini-Pont (Université Paul Cézanne Aix-Marseille); Nina Crimm (St. John 2 ̆ 7 s University); Marc DeGirolami (St. John 2 ̆ 7 s University); Javier Martínez-Torrón Universidad Complutense); Mark Movsesian (St. John 2 ̆ 7 s University); Rosemary Salomone (St. John 2 ̆ 7 s University); Brett Scharffs (Brigham Young University); Michael Simons (St. John 2 ̆ 7 s University); Emmanuel Tawil (Université Panthéon-Assas (Paris II)), and Elisabeth Zoller (Université Panthéon-Assas (Paris II)). The Center chose laïcité as the subject of its inaugural event for two reasons. First, studying laïcité allows the Center to contribute to an emerging and fruitful dialogue between American and European scholars. No longer content to focus solely on the domestic context, law-and-religion scholars increasingly consider foreign legal systems as well. This is a very positive development. Comparative work can illuminate aspects of one 2 ̆ 7 s own legal system—its history, aspirations, failures, and unstated assumptions—that one might otherwise fail to perceive. Because it is both so close to and so remote from American ideas about church-and-state—so familiar and so unfamiliar—laïcité offers a particularly good vehicle for comparison. American scholars can learn much about our conceptions of religion and religious freedom by considering the different versions {{that exist in the}} other Enlightenment Republic. And, in turn, French and European scholars can learn much about their own traditions by considering them in light of their American analogues. Second, a conference on laïcité addresses issues that greatly concern the public at large. At this writing, both France and the United States are embroiled in controversies over the place of religion in national life. In France, the National Assembly is considering a proposal to ban the burqa—le voile integral—in public places. Although the <b>Conseil</b> <b>d</b> 2 ̆ 7 Etat, France 2 ̆ 7 s highest administrative court, has expressed serious doubts about the legality of such a ban, the Sarkozy government is pushing ahead with the proposal, with widespread public support. In the United States, the plan to build a mosque near Ground Zero has caused a heated debate between those who see the mosque as an admirable symbol of religious tolerance and those who perceive it as a triumphalist gesture calculated to cause offense. Although these particular controversies concern Islam, the place of religion in public life transcends any one creed. Both French and American society must determine how best to address the fact that religious commitments remain vital for millions of their citizens—a fact that would have confounded the secularization theorists of the last century, to say nothing of philosophes like Diderot and Voltaire. The conference had three sessions: Laycock 2 ̆ 7 s Conference Introduction, titled 2 ̆ 2 American Religious Liberty, French Laïcité, and the Veil, 2 ̆ 2 and two consecutive panels, 2 ̆ 2 Laïcité in France—Contemporary Issues 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Laïcité in Comparative Perspective. 2 ̆ 2 We present here an edited transcript of the day 2 ̆ 7 s proceedings.

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to study {{constitutional}} developments in Swaziland from 1960 to 2005. Such a study {{has not yet been}} subjected to scholarly enquiry by historians. This thesis therefore {{sets out to}} fill this yawning gap in the historiography of Swaziland. In doing this longitudinal study of Swaziland s constitutional developments in the colonial and post-colonial periods, the author took into consideration the historical context, actors and processes involved. She relied heavily on primary sources including parliamentary and senatorial debates, official gazettes of the Swazi Government, Reports of the European Advisory Council and the Swazi National Council, newspapers, and oral interviews. Interviews with selected politicians and a host of legal experts were useful in illuminating cloudy constitutional issues. This thesis revealed that Swaziland s constitutional developments under British tutelage was shaped by a concatenation of factors including the African political environment in the aftermath of World War II, Swaziland s monarchical structures, its Black-White racial composition, and its geo-political location within the sphere of influence of South Africa. These factors underscored the uniqueness of Swaziland s constitutional history. The modern political leaders including John June Nquku, Dr. Ambrose Zwane, Sishayi Nxumalo, Clifford Nkosi and Dr. George Msibi formed political parties to capture power in the Kingdom of Swaziland from the departing British colonial authorities. They subscribed to Kwame Nkrumah s radical brand of nationalism which clamoured for immediate independence and Africa for Africans meaning the Africanisation of all sectors and services. While recognising the importance of the monarchy in Swazi society, they felt the Swazi King, as a traditional ruler, was ill-fitted for the business of modern governance and should restrict himself to traditional matters. The White Swazis operating under the European Advisory Council with Carl Todd as their leader, supported the conservative monarchy {{at the expense of the}} radical nationalists whose ideology threatened their investments in Swaziland. The Swazi monarch and the White minority, therefore, constituted an alliance to check the rising tide of radical nationalism in Swaziland. The various stakeholders could not come to a compromise from 1960 to 1963 over several constitutional issues, especially the future of the Swazi monarchy in a modern state and the issue of the exercise of popular suffrage on the basis of one-man-one vote; Britain therefore decided to impose a Constitution on Swaziland in 1963. The imposed Constitution failed to satisfy any of the stakeholders. The conservative traditional monarchists cried foul because King Sobhuza was provided a token ceremonial role in the constitution since Britain did not expect a traditional ruler to be engaged in modern politics. The White community under Todd rejected the constitution because equal European representation was not included in it and the traditional monarchy, which they preferred to the radical political parties, was marginalised. The radical political leaders rejected the constitution on grounds that it did not provide for one-man-one vote under universal adult suffrage and also because it introduced the federation of races which favoured the White minority who were disproportionately overrepresented in the Legislature. Britain ignored the rejection of the imposed constitution and went ahead to announce elections for June 1964. The White United Swaziland Association (USA) party and the Imbokodvo (INM) formed a coalition to contest the elections and received logistical and financial support from apartheid South Africa, while opposition parties contested the elections in dispersed ranks. Not surprisingly, the USA-INM alliance won all the seats. The initiative for the revision of the 1963 imposed constitution, therefore, fell on the two political parties in the legislature, namely the INM and the USA. The exchanges between the two allies during the constitutional debates were heated and bitter over the issue of separate electoral roll for Whites. At the end of the debates, the majority INM had its way with the establishment of a single electoral roll for all. It submitted the 1967 constitutional proposals which the British endorsed. The 1967 constitution was the penultimate constitution enacted in Swaziland which, for the first time, granted the territory full internal self-government based on a bicameral Legislature and which recognised Sobhuza as Head of State and King of Swaziland. Swaziland became independent in September 1968 under the British-tailored Westminster Constitution but the Constitution had a short life span of just five years. Two principal reasons explain the collapse of the Independence Constitution. First, Swaziland was not spared of constitutional developments in other parts of the continent where a common tendency among Anglophone independent African states was to amend, revise or alter the British-tailored Westminster Constitution and introduce a single party rule. These developments appealed to the conservative instincts of the Swazi monarchy who was no lover of the Westminster liberal democratic constitution. Second domestic developments in Swaziland led to the collapse of 1968 constitution. A dispute between the government and B. T. Ngwenya of the opposition Ngwane National Libaratory Congress after the May 1972 multiparty elections ended in court with the victory of the opposition. Sobhuza responded to this judicial decision by staging an auto-coup <b>d</b> <b>état</b> on 12 April 1973 followed by the declaration of a state of emergency. The Kingdom remained without a constitution for the next 32 years, an unprecedented constitutional void that is unrecorded in Africa s recent history. King Sobhuza ruled by the proclamation of decrees and orders-in-council. After his demise in 1982 his son, King Mswati III, continued to rule by decree until a new constitution was promulgated for Swaziland in 2005.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} analyses {{the political}} culture of Sweden {{during the reign of}} King Gustav III (1771 - 1792). This period commonly referred to as the Gustavian era followed the so-called Age of Liberty ending half a century of strong parliamentary rule in Sweden. The question {{at the heart of this}} study engages with the practice of monarchical rule under Gustav III, its ideological origins and power-political objectives as well as its symbolic expression. The study thereby addresses the very nature of kingship. In concrete terms, why did Gustav III, his court, and his civil service vigorously pursue projects that contemporaneous political opponents and, in particular, subsequent historiography have variously pictured as irrelevant, superficial, or as products of pure vanity? The answer, the study argues, is to be found in patterns of political practice as developed and exercised by Gustav III and his administration, which formed a significant part of {{the political culture}} of Gustavian Sweden. The dissertation is divided into three parts. The first traces the use and development of royal graces chivalric orders, medals, titles, privileges, and other gifts issued by the king. The practice of royal reward is illustrated through two case studies: the 1772 coup <b>d</b> <b>état</b> that established Gustav III s rule, and the birth and baptism of the crown prince, Gustav Adolf, in 1778. The second part deals with the establishment of the Court of Appeal in Vasa in 1776. The formation of the Appeals Court was accompanied by a host of ceremonial, rhetorical, emblematic, and architectural features solidifying its importance as one of Gustav III s most symbolic administrative reform projects and hence portraying the king as an enlightened monarch par excellence. The third and final part of the thesis engages with war as a cultural phenomenon and focuses on the Russo-Swedish War of 1788 - 1790. In this study, the war against Russia is primarily seen as an arena for the king and other players to stage, create and re-create as well as articulate themselves through scenes and roles adhering to a particular cultural idiom. Its codes and symbolic forms, then, were communicated by means of theatre, literature, art, history, and classical mythology. The dissertation makes use of a host of sources: protocols, speeches, letters, diaries, newspapers, poetry, art, medals, architecture, inscriptions and registers. Traditional political source material and literary and art sources are studied as totalities, not as separate entities. Also it is argued that political and non-fictional sources cannot be understood properly without acknowledging the context of genre, literary conventions, and artistic modes. The study critically views the futile, but nonetheless almost habitual juxtaposition of the reality of images, ideas, and metaphors, and the reality of supposedly factual historical events. Significantly, the thesis presumes the symbolic dimension to be a constitutive element of reality, not its cooked up misrepresentation. This presumption is reflected in a discussion of the concept of role, which should not be anachronistically understood as roles in which the king cast himself at different times and in different situations. Neither Gustav III nor other European sovereigns of this period played the roles as rulers or majesties. Rather, they were monarchs both in their own eyes and in the eyes of their contemporaries as well as in all relations and contexts. Key words: Eighteenth-Century, Gustav III, Cultural History, Monarchs, Royal Graces, the Vasa Court of Appeal, the Russo-Swedish War 1788 – 1790. Avhandlingen undersöker den gustavianska politiska kulturen utgående från frågan vad konungaskap egentligen var under 1700 -talets andra hälft. Arbetet söker svar på frågan varför Gustaf III, hans ämbetsmän, kavaljerer och andra samtida ägnade så stor möda på företeelser som av andra samtida och framför allt många senare tiders forskare inte har uppfattats som relevanta. Teatrala tornerspel, heroisk opera, högtidliga ceremonier, detaljerade etikettsregler, extravaganta uttryck för kungens nåd, målningar, medaljer och arkitektur kunde få kungens odelade uppmärksamhet. Kungens kritiker ansåg tidvis att dessa förehavanden var onödigt dyra och tidskrävande. Senare historiker, författare, regissörer och andra som har skildrat Gustaf III har inte sällan sett detta ruling by semiotics som tecken på fåfänga, ytlighet eller okunnighet. Varför sysslade Gustaf III inte med allvarliga statsangelägenheter? Var han bara en teaterkung ? Arbetet bygger på ett brett källmaterial bestående av protokoll, tal, brev, dagböcker, tidningspress, diktning, dramatik, målningar, medaljer, ritningar och inskriptioner. En första del behandlar de kungliga nådevedermälena: ordnar, medaljer, nobilisering, titlar, tjänster och gåvor. En andra del undersöker ceremonier, retorik och ikonografi i samband med grundandet av Vasa hovrätt 1776. Den tredje och sista delen betraktar det ryska kriget 1788 1790 som en scen där kungens och andra aktörers agerande kan studeras i relation till litterära och konstnärliga konventioner. Avhandlingen kritiserar ett slentrianmässigt jämförande av föreställningarnas, idéernas och metaforernas verklighet med faktahistoriens händelsehistoriska verklighet som ett slags facit. Kritiken utmynnar i en diskussion om begreppet roll och det om Gustaf III myntade begreppet den stora rollen, som i sig ofta implicerar en för 1700 -talet och Gustaf III främmande förklaringsmodell om en individ som iklär sig påklistrade roller. Gustaf III och hans gelikar på de europeiska kejserliga och kungliga tronerna spelade inte rollen av en härskare eller ett majestät, utan de var Majestätet i alla sammanhang, både i egna och i omvärldens ögon...|$|R
