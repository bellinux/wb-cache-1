40|$|Purpose: Nonpassive fit {{frameworks}} {{are believed}} to lead to implant overload and consequently loss of osseointegration. This {{is one of the}} most commonly reported failures of implant prostheses. In an ideal situation of passive fit, when torque is applied to bring the abutment-cylinder interface together some amount of deformation can be expected, and it should be homogeneous along the periphery of the abutment. The aim of this study was to verify the amount of abutment deformation that can be expected when a free-standing cylinder is screwed into place. This could give insight into what should be accepted as passive fit. Materials and Methods: Strain gauges were bonded to the sides of five standard abutments that had machined palladium-silver cylinders or cobalt-chromium cast cylinders screwed into place. Measurements were taken to verify the deformation at each site. Results: Values of abutment deformation after abutment screw tightening ranged from - 127. 70 to - 590. 27 mu epsilon. The deformation recorded for palladium-silver prosthetic cylinder tightening ranged from 56. 905 to - 381. 50 mu epsilon (mean: 173. 298 mu epsilon) and from - 5. 62638 to - 383. 86 mu epsilon (mean: 200. 474 mu epsilon) for cobalt-chromium cylinders. There was no statistically significant difference among the two groups. Conclusion: Both abutment screw tightening and prosthetic <b>cylinder</b> <b>screw</b> tightening result in abutment deformation, which is compressive most of the time.

The CNTs were dispersed into the host HDPE matrix by shearing action only of a pair of <b>cylinder</b> <b>screws</b> and then hot-pressed. HRTEM observations indicate that the N-MWNT product exhibits a bamboo shape with 97 % purity and a high selectivity. The presence of N-MWNT in polymer matrix HDPE is clearly observed even at low loadings of N-MWNTs. The fraction of the crystalline phase was determined from the normalized integrated intensity of the 1, 418  cm- 1 Raman band, which represents the orthorhombic crystalline phase in polyethylene. The XRD analysis demonstrated that the crystalline structure of HDPE matrix was not affected by the incorporation of the N-MWNTs.|$|R

5000|$|Lead [...] {{and pitch}} {{are closely related}} concepts. They can be {{confused}} {{because they are the}} same for most screws. Lead is the distance along the screw's axis that is covered by one complete rotation of the screw (360°). Pitch is the distance from the crest of one thread to the next. Because the vast majority of screw threadforms are single-start threadforms, their lead and pitch are the same. Single-start means {{that there is only one}} [...] "ridge" [...] wrapped around the <b>cylinder</b> of the <b>screw's</b> body. Each time that the screw's body rotates one turn (360°), it has advanced axially by the width of one ridge. [...] "Double-start" [...] means that there are two [...] "ridges" [...] wrapped around the <b>cylinder</b> of the <b>screw's</b> body. Each time that the screw's body rotates one turn (360°), it has advanced axially by the width of two ridges. Another way to express this is that lead and pitch are parametrically related, and the parameter that relates them, the number of starts, very often has a value of 1, in which case their relationship becomes equality. In general, lead is equal to pitch times the number of starts.|$|R

The models were digitized with an industrial scanner (IScan D 104 I®) used as a reference, and with four intraoral scanners (Trios®; CS 3500 ®; Zfx Intrascan®; Planscan®). Five scans were taken for each model, using each different intraoral scanner. All datasets were loaded into reverse-engineering software (Geomagics 2012 ®), where intraoral scans were superimposed on the reference model, to evaluate general trueness, and superimposed on each other within groups, to evaluate general precision. General trueness and precision of any scanner were compared by model type, through an ANOVA model including scanner, model and their interaction. Finally, the distance and angles between simulated implants were measured in each group, and compared to those of the reference model, to evaluate local trueness. In the partially edentulous maxilla, CS 3500 ® had the best general trueness (47. 8 μm) and precision (40. 8 μm), followed by Trios® (trueness 71. 2 μm, precision 51. 0 μm), Zfx Intrascan® (trueness 117. 0 μm, precision 126. 2 μm), and Planscan® (trueness 233. 4 μm, precision 219. 8 μm). With regard to general trueness, Trios® was significantly better than Planscan®, CS 3500 ® was significantly better than Zfx Intrascan® and Planscan®, and Zfx Intrascan® was significantly better than Planscan®; with regard to general precision, Trios® was significantly better than Zfx Intrascan® and Planscan®, CS 3500 ® was significantly better than Zfx Intrascan® and Planscan®, and Zfx Intrascan® was significantly better than Planscan®.

Methods: Two gypsum models were prepared with respectively three and six implant analogues, and polyether-ether-ketone <b>cylinders</b> <b>screwed</b> on. These models were scanned with a reference scanner (ScanRiderÂ®), and with four IOS (CS 3600 Â®, Trios 3 Â®, OmnicamÂ®, TrueDefinitionÂ®); five scans were taken for each model, using each IOS. All IOS datasets were loaded into reverse-engineering software, where they were superimposed on the reference model, to evaluate trueness, and superimposed on each other within groups, to determine precision.
