25|$|However, {{there are}} still 23 million {{children}} in the region {{between the ages of}} 4 and 17 outside of the formal education system.

Among primary school age children (ages 6 to 12), coverage is almost universal; however there is still a need to incorporate 5 million children in the primary education system. These <b>children</b> <b>live</b> mostly in remote areas, are indigenous or Afro-descendants and live in extreme poverty.|$|E

25|$|Members of the fathers' rights {{movement}} {{campaign for the}} reform of child support guidelines, which in most Western countries are based on maintaining the children's standard of living after separation, and {{on the assumption that}} the <b>children</b> <b>live</b> with one parent and never with the other. Activists state that the current guidelines are arbitrary, provide mothers with financial incentives to divorce, and leave fathers with little discretionary income to enjoy with the children during their parenting time. In the US, fathers' rights activists propose guidelines based on a Cost Shares model, in which child support would be based on the average income of the parents and the estimated child costs incurred by both parents. Laura W. Morgan has stated that it focuses on the relative living standards of divorcing parents rather than the best interests of the children and financially supporting them at the same level after divorce.|$|E
25|$|For {{the scene}} where Aaron tricks Titus into cutting off one of his hands, the primary source was {{probably}} an unnamed popular tale about a Moor's vengeance, published in various languages throughout the sixteenth century (an English version entered into the Stationers' Register in 1569 has not survived). In the story, a married noble man with two children chastises his Moorish servant, who vows revenge. The servant goes to the moated tower where the man's wife and <b>children</b> <b>live,</b> and rapes the wife. Her screams bring her husband, but the Moor pulls up the drawbridge before the nobleman can gain entry. The Moor then kills both children on the battlements {{in full view of}} the man. The nobleman pleads with the Moor that he will do anything to save his wife, and the Moor demands he cut off his nose. The man does so, but the Moor kills the wife anyway, and the nobleman dies of shock. The Moor then flings himself from the battlements to avoid punishment.|$|E
