40|$|The {{patterning}} of sol-gel-derived {{thin films}} by micromolding in capillaries can produce unintended topographical {{deviations from the}} shape of the original mold that may limit the utility of the technique in potential applications. During drying and heat treatment, nonuniform shrinkage across the film due to the densification of the gel matrix results in “double-peak ” film topographies whereby the film thickness is greater at the lateral edges than in the middle. Using the same framework used to understand the imbibition and wetting of the sol-gel in the capillary channels, we developed a mechanism to explain the formation of the double-peak profile.

Each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried.

After assembly, BacChips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. To use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased PDMS draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. After the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air is drawn into the BacChip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. A pH indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. Importantly, BacChips operate without external equipment or instruments.

EGaIn is well-suited for this application because of its rheological properties at room temperature: it behaves like an elastic material until it experiences a critical surface stress, at which point it yields and flows readily. These properties allow EGaIn to fill microchannels rapidly when sufficient pressure {{is applied to the}} inlet of the channels, yet maintain structural stability within the channels once ambient pressure is restored. Experiments conducted in microfluidic channels, and in a parallel-plate rheometer, suggest that EGaIn’s behavior is dictated by the properties of its surface (predominantly gallium oxide, as determined by Auger measurements); these two experiments both yield approximately the same number for the critical surface stress required to induce EGaIn to flow (~ 0. 5 N/m).

40|$|An {{arrangement}} of cooling <b>channels</b> in a <b>mold</b> {{should be designed}} properly to improve productivity and formability for a molded product in injection molding, because temperature distribution on the mold {{is dependent on the}} arrangement and has some influence on molded defects. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop a methodology for automatically designing {{arrangement of}} cooling channels so as to obtain the suitable temperature distribution to reduce molded defects and to realize high productivity. A cooling channel is modeled by a set of autonomous elements which is arranged as a line and has performance for extracting heat in the mold. The arrangement of cooling channels are automatically obtained by autonomous action of these elements, according to information sent from sources which are located on the mold cavity surface and evaluate temperature on its location. For estimating the temperature distribution, a steady-state heat conduction is assumed for heattransfer in the mold and calculated by numerical analysis. Several numerical experiments have been conducted for estimating the proposed method, and the effectiveness and feasibility have beeit confirmed for automatic design of cooling channels...|$|R
