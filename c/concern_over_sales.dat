"Succeeded Without Being a [...] "Catalog Dealer,'", by Bert Aaron Rose (1866-1940), Vol. 64, No. 26, December 23, 1922, pg. 32: The author, {{owner of}} the Metropolitan Music Co. in Minneapolis and {{director}} of bands at the University of Minnesota, illuminates the threat of catalog sales, similar to early 21st-century <b>concerns</b> <b>over</b> online <b>sales</b> vs. physical stores ...|$|R
50|$|Sinatra and Jobim {{followed}} up this album with sessions {{for a second}} collaboration, titled Sinatra-Jobim. That album was briefly released on 8-track tape in 1970 before being taken out of print at Sinatra's behest, due to <b>concerns</b> <b>over</b> its <b>sales</b> potential. Several of the Sinatra-Jobim tracks were subsequently incorporated in the Sinatra & Company album (1971) and the Sinatra-Jobim Sessions compilation (1979). In 2010 the Concord Records label issued a new, comprehensive compilation titled Sinatra/Jobim: The Complete Reprise Recordings.|$|R
5000|$|From 1963 to 1973, 128 nations {{received}} $2.5 {{trillion in}} weapons and services, the majority from the United States. Law only {{required that the}} Secretary of State report “significant” arms sales to Congress, semi-annually. In the early 1970s, legislators moved {{to become involved in}} deciding to whom arm sales could be made and under what circumstances. [...] <b>Concern</b> <b>over</b> arms <b>sales</b> increased significantly in the summer of 1973, when news surfaced of a potential Nixon Administration sale of F-4 fighter-bombers to Saudi Arabia.|$|R
50|$|The {{project was}} {{initiated}} {{at the end}} of 1997. The original purpose had been to create an electronic version of the massive dictionary known as Plena Ilustrita Vortaro de Esperanto (1970 and 2002 editions), but {{due to a lack of}} interest on the part of the PIV editors, at least partly due to <b>concerns</b> <b>over</b> harming <b>sales</b> of the printed volume, the project changed its focus to creating a separate Internet-use dictionary. One of its major sources is the Plena Vortaro de Esperanto (1930, with the 1953 supplement of Gaston Waringhien).|$|R
5|$|Roughly 49% of {{diamonds}} originate from Central and Southern Africa, although significant {{sources of the}} mineral have been discovered in Canada, India, Russia, Brazil, and Australia. They are mined from kimberlite and lamproite volcanic pipes, which can bring diamond crystals, originating from deep within the Earth where high pressures and temperatures enable them to form, to the surface. The mining and distribution of natural diamonds are subjects of frequent controversy such as <b>concerns</b> <b>over</b> the <b>sale</b> of blood diamonds or conflict diamonds by African paramilitary groups. The diamond supply chain is controlled by {{a limited number of}} powerful businesses, and is also highly concentrated in a small number of locations around the world.|$|R
5000|$|Ray DeMarini {{founded the}} company in Oregon in 1989, {{introducing}} a [...] "high-tech" [...] softball bat. The company's 1995 introduction of double wall bats, and the increased power they provided, drew praise and propelled the company's success, but also prompted <b>concern</b> <b>over</b> bat safety. <b>Sales</b> surpassed 10,000 bats annually in the mid-1990s. Acquired by Wilson Sporting Goods in 2000, DeMarini continues to research, design and build bats in its Hillsboro, Oregon facility. In 2012, the company expanded the business by adding softball and baseball apparel.|$|R
500|$|In the U.S., Class A breeders are {{licensed}} by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to sell animals for research purposes, while Class B dealers are licensed to buy animals from [...] "random sources" [...] such as auctions, pound seizure, and newspaper ads. Some Class B dealers {{have been accused of}} kidnapping pets and illegally trapping strays, a practice known as bunching. It was in part out of public <b>concern</b> <b>over</b> the <b>sale</b> of pets to research facilities that the 1966 Laboratory Animal Welfare Act was ushered in—the Senate Committee on Commerce reported in 1966 that stolen pets had been retrieved from Veterans Administration facilities, the Mayo Institute, the University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, and Harvard and Yale Medical Schools. The USDA recovered at least a dozen stolen pets during a raid on a Class B dealer in Arkansas in 2003.|$|R
50|$|In recent years, Saligão, {{which is}} just outside the North Goa beach-belt, has seen {{significant}} <b>concerns</b> <b>over</b> the large-scale <b>sale</b> of ground-water {{from a number of}} wells in the village, particularly at Donvaddo. There has also been concern raised by villagers over the dumping of garbage from the coastal belt on the hillock atop the village, partly on village lands and partly on land belonging to the Calangute comunidade but very close (and overlooking) the village. On December 12, 2002, a writ petition was filed over this issue in the Goa bench of the High Court of Bombay.|$|R
50|$|On November 25, 2012, O'Brien {{received}} notice from NC State that he {{had been}} dismissed effective immediately despite navigating the team to a 7-5 regular-season record. Athletic director Debbie Yow cited several reasons. She was <b>concerned</b> <b>over</b> lagging season-ticket <b>sales,</b> as well as his approach to recruiting. O'Brien's recruiting classes were frequently in {{the bottom half of the}} nation, and Yow wanted a coach who could bring top 25-type talent to Raleigh. NCSU was obligated to pay $1.2 million of non-state funds to O'Brien, as his contract ran through the 2015 season. However, NCSU ended up only having to pay O'Brien $200,000 after the buyout was renegotiated so he could become an assistant at Virginia.|$|R

50|$|Historically Quail Valley was {{centered}} the Quail Valley Country Club, owned by Renaissance Golf Group LLC of Dublin, Ohio, {{which included a}} group of golf courses: a nine-hole executive course, a nine-hole par-3 course, and two championship golf courses with 18 holes each. The golf courses took up 400 acre of land. In 2007 Renaissance Golf Group indicated it was considering selling the golf courses. By then the country club property had fallen {{into a state of}} disrepair. Area residents had <b>concerns</b> <b>over</b> how the <b>sale</b> would affect their property values. The Quail Valley Fund initially had plans to buy the property, but the City of Missouri City government indicated it wished to purchase the golf courses, and on April 2, 2007 a consultant received money from city officials to do a feasibility study over converting the properties into a municipal park.|$|R
25|$|The Ingrim–Pabst–Pauley group {{attempted}} to sell KTVU to NBC in 1960, as the network sought {{to acquire a}} television station in the Bay Area to operate alongside KNBC radio (now KNBR). The sale was eventually cancelled in October 1961, due to pre-existing <b>concerns</b> <b>over</b> the <b>sale</b> cited by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that were related to NBC's ownership of radio and television stations in Philadelphia. Eighteen months after the sale to NBC was aborted, in July 1963 channel 2 was sold to the Miami Valley Broadcasting Company, a subsidiary of Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises, for $12.3 million; the sale was finalized in mid-October of that year. Over the station's history as an independent, KTVU's programming schedule consisted mainly of syndicated off-network series, movies, talk shows and religious programs, {{as well as a}} sizeable amount of locally produced news, sports, talk and public affairs programming. In 1960, after acquiring camera, projection and slide equipment to transmit programming available in the format, the station began broadcasting its programming in color; much of the programs that it broadcast in color consisted of movies and certain series acquired from the syndication market that were produced in the format, as well as locally produced specials.|$|R

2500|$|The J-11/J-11B's {{legitimacy}} remains unproven, {{despite a}} wealth of information coming to light since 2007. In the course of a press conference at the 2009 Farnborough Airshow, Alexander Fomin, Deputy Director of Russia's Federal Service for Military-Technical Co-operation, reported that Russia had not so far tabled any questions to China with regard to [...] "copying" [...] military equipment. Fomin reported that Russia handed China the licences to manufacture the aircraft and its components, including an agreement on the production of intellectual property rights. Details of intellectual property rights, however have not been disclosed, fuelling speculation about a [...] "secret" [...] contract or parts of the original contract. The licence, at least officially, did not include an aircraft carrier version- Sukhoi Su-33 nor any variant of it, such as the Shenyang J-15. At the MAKS 2009, Rosoboronexport's General Manager Anatoli Isaykin was quoted saying: [...] "Russia is going to investigate the J-11B, as a Chinese copy of the Su-27 and Sukhoi Company is partaking in the process." [...] In 2010, Rosoboronexport announced via their official website that it was in talks with the Chinese side, regarding the ongoing production of weapons that Russia considers as un-licensed. In light of the ongoing investigations, Rosoboronexport expressed its <b>concern</b> <b>over</b> future <b>sales</b> of advanced Russian systems and components to China.|$|R
5|$|Castlevania was rebooted {{due to the}} team's <b>concern</b> <b>over</b> {{the poor}} <b>sales</b> in their latest Castlevania games. The team wished to expand the franchise's fanbase with this game. A number of prototypes in {{parallel}} development competed {{to become the next}} Castlevania title. Konami told MercurySteam the game would be an original intellectual property (IP) when it was first greenlit as a Castlevania title. Konami eventually asked them to cease work on Lords of Shadow while it was still in its early stages, until David Cox showed the Japanese senior management the game and was offered help by video game designer Hideo Kojima. Konami then chose the pitch for it as the next Castlevania entry. The original concept for the game was to remake the first Castlevania starring Simon Belmont, but it was later decided to make a reboot of the franchise. Lords of Shadow still drew inspiration from earlier titles in the series, most notably Castlevania for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and Super Castlevania IV.|$|R
50|$|The Hedgcoxe War of 1852, {{also known}} as the Peters colony rebellion, was an armed {{uprising}} of Texas colonists protesting what they viewed as an attempt by the Peters Colony land company to invalidate their land claims. From its inception the colony had been embroiled in controversy regarding the terms of agreement between the land company and the settlers. On February 10, 1852, the state legislature, in an attempt to satisfy both the colonists and the land company, passed a compromise law. According to its terms all lawsuits between the land company and the state were to be withdrawn, the colonists were to be given new guidelines and extended time for filing their claims, and the state was to give the land company 1088000 acre of land. But the colonists, <b>concerned</b> <b>over</b> the possible <b>sale</b> of some claims and angered over the legislature's generosity towards the land company, continued their protest and demanded that the law be repealed.|$|R
5000|$|While the Japanese {{release of}} Shadow Tower Abyss {{continued}} as planned, the English version was cancelled during the localisation stage. Mark Johnson, Agetec's producer, announced the cancellation on the SCEA website {{and stated that}} [...] "for {{the most part the}} localization was completed, aside from package and manual." [...] According to Johnson, the publisher had expressed <b>concerns</b> <b>over</b> its projected <b>sales</b> outside of its home market. Although Shadow Tower Abyss was ranked 14th overall and had been released mid-week, only 12,908 units were sold in Japan in the period from 20 to 26 October 2003. SCEA was also worried at the game's visual quality in comparison with its contemporary rivals within the role-playing and first-person genres. Johnson {{went on to say that}} the cancellation was [...] "by far the hardest thing for me to accept and I did everything possible to fight for its release." [...] A petition to SCEA was unsuccessful. Instead, Agetec went on to publish one of From Software's other games, Echo Night: Beyond, in the United States in 2004.|$|R

5000|$|Animals used by {{laboratories}} {{are largely}} supplied by specialist dealers. Sources differ for vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Most laboratories breed and raise flies and worms themselves, using strains and mutants supplied {{from a few}} main stock centers. For vertebrates, sources include breeders and dealers like Covance and Charles River Laboratories who supply purpose-bred and wild-caught animals; businesses that trade in wild animals such as Nafovanny; and dealers who supply animals sourced from pounds, auctions, and newspaper ads. Animal shelters also supply the laboratories directly. Large centers also exist to distribute strains of genetically modified animals; the International Knockout Mouse Consortium, for example, aims to provide knockout mice for every gene in the mouse genome.In the U.S., Class A breeders are licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to sell animals for research purposes, while Class B dealers are licensed to buy animals from [...] "random sources" [...] such as auctions, pound seizure, and newspaper ads.

5000|$|On October 29, 2013 National Action Network {{along with}} other civil rights groups formed a shop-and-frisk task force and convened their first meeting with Barneys CEO Mark Lee. The meeting was brought about when a young African American man claimed that after making a {{purchase}} of a designer belt Barneys, after leaving the store he was confronted by undercover New York Police Department officers, who said a Barneys employee raised <b>concerns</b> <b>over</b> the <b>sale.</b> In court documents, Christian says he showed officers his receipt, debit card and identification but was told “he {{could not afford to}} make such an expensive purchase” before being placed in a cell for more than two hours. Ultimately, no charges were filed. At this initial meeting Barneys CEO Mark Lee promised a thorough review of Barneys’ practices and procedures to ensure they reflect the company’s “continued commitment to fairness and equality.” Following this meeting the task force met with Macy's Inc Chairman Terry Lundgren to address similar concerns. One of the outcomes from these meetings was the creation of a 'Customers' Bill of Rights' that was then posted in 2013 during the holiday shopping season. Among those rights outlined in the document is a requirement for store security personnel — some of whom roam the aisles in plainclothes — to identify themselves when interacting with customers. Prohibited is [...] "the use of excessive force" [...] or [...] "threatening, vulgar language" [...] when detaining people suspected of theft. People suspected of engaging in a crime can be detained [...] "only in a reasonable manner and not for more than a reasonable time." ...|$|R

Empirical analysis first establishes the critical and distinct roles played by economic and cultural <b>concerns</b> <b>over</b> immigration in determining citizen 2 ̆ 019 s rightward ideology and voting for right-wing parties. Second, we investigate the determinants of economic and cultural <b>concerns</b> <b>over</b> immigration, finding strong and consistent evidence for the salience hypothesis, which suggests that immigrant share of a country 2 ̆ 019 s population shapes citizen <b>concerns</b> <b>over</b> immigration. Thereafter, we document the roles of macro-level economic and cultural channels in determining the strength of salience effects.
