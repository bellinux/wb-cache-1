50|$|Cryogenic {{deflashing}} is a deflashing {{process that}} uses cryogenic temperatures {{to aid in}} the removal of flash on <b>cast</b> <b>or</b> <b>molded</b> workpieces.

50|$|Many {{beautiful}} replicas {{are made}} of animalier sculpture, which may be <b>cast</b> <b>or</b> <b>molded</b> in any size and of any material. The most desirable of these are exact in detail and made from the same material, such as cast iron, spelter, or cast bronze, as used in the artist's original sculpture. Most of the original animalier sculptors used the traditional lost wax process of casting prevalent at the time. Alexandre Guionnet was exceptional in that he worked in wood. Modern reproductions of the original sculptures frequently use patinated verdigris cast bronze or iron, or bonded marble resin (pulverized reconstituted marble combined with resin glue), as well as various other materials and techniques, such as a composite of Capiz placuna placenta oyster shells, also known as window oyster shells, which come primarily from the Philippines (where they are known as kapiz).|$|E

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{electromagnetic}} soft magnetic material (SMM) is introduced, based on spherical iron powder particles and a suitable polymer binder. A key feature of this material {{is that it can}} be <b>cast</b> <b>or</b> <b>molded</b> into almost any 3 D shape, hence the denotation soft magnetic moldable composite ((SMC) -C- 2). The SM 2 C is compared with a set of reference materials, such as ferrites, laminated steels, and soft magnetic composites, in terms of primary properties such as permeability and loss, and other properties, such as thermal conductivity and manufacturability. The SM 2 C has the obvious disadvantage of relatively low permeability, but offers benefits such as relatively low losses and high potential for close integration into electromagnetic circuits. Some recent SM 2 C applications are illustrated, and design and manufacturing aspects are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} common ways of adding {{stiffness}} to localized areas of a structure is through the use of rib stiffeners. Figure 1 shows a rib stiffener attached to a plate structure. Rib stiffeners are usually attached to the surface of an existing structure by welding, gluing or bolting. Alternatively, they can be <b>cast</b> <b>or</b> <b>molded</b> onto the surface of the structure if the structure is formed by a casting or molding process. Rib stiffeners are a common means of increasing structural stiffness and can be modeled quickly and simply with the Structural Dynamics Modification (SDM) technique. The main advantage of SDM over Finite Element Analysis (FEA), or prototype fabrication and testing, is its speed. Hence, SDM allows a designer to explore a larger number of design modifications without having to fabricate and retest each one, or without having to build and analyze a variety of different finite element models. The most effective use of SDM, however, is with the combined use of modal testing and FEA. A finite element analysis and a modal test should be performed on the unmodified structure first. This is done to confirm the validity of the finite element model using the modal test data. SDM can then be more effectively applied to the larger data base of finite element modes. In this paper, the validity and accuracy of the SDM approach to modeling rib stiffeners is investigated by comparing SDM-generated results with those of an FEA and with modal test results. First, the modal parameters of a plate structure are generated from a finite element model and are compared to the parameters obtained from a modal test. Then, the modes of the structure are compared after a rib stiffener modification has been modeled using SDM and FEA, and these results are compared with test results taken from the real structur with the rib stiffener attached to it...|$|E

50|$|A sprue is {{the passage}} through which liquid {{material}} is introduced into a mold.

60|$|The obnoxious objects stood some {{hundred yards}} away from the speaker, who waved toward them with his ax; and there was {{something}} suggestive in the comparison. That coast, to begin with, stretching toward the sunset, was itself almost as fantastic as a sunset cloud. It was cut out against the emerald or indigo of the sea in graven horns and crescents that might be the <b>cast</b> <b>or</b> <b>mold</b> of some such crested serpents; and, beneath, was pierced and fretted by caves and crevices, as if by the boring of some such titanic worms. Over and above this draconian architecture of the earth a veil of gray woods hung thinner like a vapor; woods which the witchcraft of the sea had, as usual, both blighted and blown out of shape. To the right the trees trailed along the sea front in a single line, each drawn out in thin wild lines like a caricature. At the other end of their extent they multiplied into a huddle of hunchbacked trees, a wood spreading toward a projecting part of the high coast. It was here that the sight appeared to which so many eyes and minds seemed to be almost automatically turning.|$|R

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways insects can be fossilized and preserved including compressions and impressions, concretions, mineral replication, charcoalified (fusainized) remains, and their trace remains. Compressions and Impressions are the most extensive types of insect fossils, occurring in rocks from the Carboniferous to Recent. Impressions are like a <b>cast</b> <b>or</b> <b>mold</b> of a fossil insect, showing its form and even some relief, like pleating in the wings, but usually little or no color from the cuticle. Compressions preserve remains of the cuticle, so color distinguishes structure. In exceptional situations, microscopic features such as microtrichia on sclerites and wing membranes are even visible, but preservation of this scale also requires a matrix of exceptionally fine grain, such as in micritic muds and volcanic tuffs. Because arthropod sclerites are held together by membranes, which readily decompose, many fossil arthropods are known only by isolated sclerites. Far more desirable are complete fossils. Concretions are stones with a fossil at the core whose chemical composition {{differs from that of}} the surrounding matrix, usually formed as a result of mineral precipitation from decaying organisms. The most significant deposit consists of various localities of the Late Carboniferous Francis Creek Shale of the Carbondale Formation at Mazon Creek, Illinois, which are composed of shales and coal seams yielding oblong concretions. Within most concretions is a mold of an animal and sometimes a plant that is usually marine in origin.|$|R

In this work, laser micromachining of D 2 tool steel with a ns-pulsed fiber laser is investigated.

25|$|The common {{denominator}} among most deposits of fossil insects and terrestrial plants is the lake environment. Those insects that became preserved were either {{living in the}} fossil lake (autochthonous) or carried into it from surrounding habitats by winds, stream currents, or their own flight (allochthonous). Drowning and dying insects not eaten by fish and other predators settle to the bottom, where they may be preserved in the lakeâs sediments, called lacustrine, under appropriate conditions. Even amber, or fossil resin from trees, requires a watery environment that is lacustrine or brackish {{in order to be}} preserved. Without protection in anoxic sediments, amber would gradually disintegrate; it is never found buried in fossil soils. Various factors contribute greatly to what kinds of insects become preserved and how well, if indeed at all, including lake depth, temperature, and alkalinity; type of sediments; whether the lake was surrounded by forest or vast and featureless salt pans; and if it was choked in anoxia or highly oxygenated. There are some major exceptions to the lacustrine theme of fossil insects, the most famous being the Late Jurassic limestones from Solnhofen and EichstÃ¤tt, Germany, which are marine. These deposits are famous for pterosaurs and the earliest bird, Archaeopteryx. The limestones were formed by a very fine mud of calcite that settled within stagnant, hypersaline bays isolated from inland seas. Most organisms in these limestones, including rare insects, were preserved intact, sometimes with feathers and outlines of soft wing membranes, indicating that there was very little decay. The insects, however, are like <b>casts</b> <b>or</b> <b>molds,</b> having relief but little detail. In some cases iron oxides precipitated around wing veins, revealing better detail.|$|R
40|$|Between 1986 and 1990, we treated 68 {{patients}} with diabetes and neuroarthropathy of the midfoot, 21 {{of whom had}} bilateral involvement. Patients were managed accord-ing to a strict protocol defined by activity of the neuroar-thropathy, instability, ulceration, infection, and ischemia. Initial management of acute neuroarthropathy (18 feet) was open reduction and arthrodesis (8), a total-contact <b>cast</b> <b>or</b> brace (9), and amputation (1). All {{patients with}} subacute neuroarthropathy (30 feet) were initially treated in a total contact cast. Four of these feet subsequently required amputation, two required arthrodesis, and one required exostectomy. For chronic neuroarthropathy (41 feet), a total-contact <b>cast</b> <b>or</b> a <b>molded</b> orthotic insert with or without bracing was used initially in all feet. Subsequent surgical salvage for this group included arthrodesis (9), plantar exostectomy (6), amputation (2), and abscess drainage (2).

Incidentally, Bengal artisans are more accustomed to piece mold process unlike tribal artisans who practiced investment casting process. This piece mold casting process has been reconstructed to get the idea of metal characteristics in order to investigate ancient casting process of Bengal and Bangladesh. The characterization of ancient archaeo-metal products come to a type of cast Cu-Sn-Zn-Pb type quaternary alloy produced by a slow freezing process. Though these alloys physically differ from the traditional cast alloy of binary Cu-Zn type brass, the physical characteristics are similar to the binary cast alloy character.

50|$|The {{most common}} form of {{manufacture}} for kits is injection molded polystyrene plastic, using carbon steel molds. Today, this takes place mostly in China, Taiwan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Eastern Europe. Injection molding allows a high degree of precision and automation not available in the other manufacturing processes used for models but the molds are expensive and require large production runs {{to cover the cost of}} making them. Smaller and cheaper runs can be done with cast copper molds, and some companies do even smaller runs using <b>cast</b> resin <b>or</b> rubber <b>molds,</b> but the durability is of a lower standard than carbon steel and labour costs are higher.|$|R

40|$|Synthetic fibers {{within a}} {{flowable}} fibrous concrete (FFC) mixture {{were characterized by}} relating their spatial distribution and orientations, determined from x-ray computed tomography (CT), with the measured toughness or fracture energy response of a FFC specimen. This new type of concrete, FFC, was developed to provide a workable, flowable mixture that could be utilized to rapidly construct thin concrete pavement inlays. A full-scale demonstration project verified the feasibility of constructing the FFC as a 5 cm thick inlay bonded to an existing asphalt pavement. In order to quantify this new FFC material, flexural beam properties were measured to determine the material???s toughness and fracture properties. Unnotched beams of the FFC material verified that the measured nominal strength and measured toughness increased as the specimen size was reduced. A high energy x-ray CT and image processing technique were utilized to identify the synthetic fibers in the hardened FFC through contrast and shape-based filtering from the 3 D images. The filtered images showed the number of fibers across any given vertical plane in a FFC specimen was directly correlated with the measured total fracture energy. Fibers located near a surface (<b>cast</b> <b>or</b> <b>mold)</b> within a boundary zone size estimated at ?? to ?? of the fiber length, {{were found to have}} a higher alignment parallel to the surface with a lower number of fibers in this boundary zone, than the interior of the specimen. Fiber alignment in the FFC fracture beams had a less significant contribution, relative to the number of fibers, on the measured total fracture energy. For the FFC mixture, volumetric segregation of fibers occurred within a 15 cm cast beam, based on the analysis of the CT images. A finite element analysis using a tri-linear softening model successfully simulated the behavior of FFC for larger (15 cm) notched beam specimens and for some smaller (5 cm) beam specimens. However, a deflection hardening response occurred in some of these other 5 cm beam FFC specimens due to the higher local fiber content, for which the tri-linear softening modeling approach could not accurately simulate this post-cracking response...|$|R
40|$|Shell <b>mold</b> <b>casting</b> <b>or</b> shell <b>molding</b> is a {{metal casting}} process in {{manufacturing}} industry {{in which the}} mold is a thin hardened shell of sand and thermosetting resin binder backed up by some other material. The internal surface of the shell mold is very smooth and rigid. This allows for an easy flow of the liquid metal through the mold cavity during the pouring of the casting, giving castings a very good surface finish. Shell mold casting enables the manufacture of complex parts with thin sections and smaller projections than green sand mold casting. Manufacturing with the shell mold process also imparts high dimensional accuracy. Tolerances of. 010 inches (. 25 mm) are possible. Further machining is usually unnecessary when casting by this process. Shell mold casting is particularly suitable for steel castings under 20 lbs; however almost any metal that can be cast in sand can be cast with shell molding process. Also much larger parts have been manufactured with shell molding. Typical parts manufactured in industry using the shell mold casting process include cylinder heads, gears, bushings, connecting rods, camshafts and valve bodies...|$|R
40|$|Soldering is {{a unique}} casting defect {{associated}} with die <b>casting</b> <b>or</b> metal <b>mold</b> <b>casting</b> of aluminum alloys. It occurs when molten aluminum sticks or solders {{the surface of the}} die steel and remains there after the ejection of the casting, causing a surface defect and dimensional inaccuracy of the castings and increased machine downtime. Soldering occurs easily when a bare die steel mold is used for die casting of aluminum alloys. When molten aluminum comes in contact with the die steel at a temperature higher than a critical temperature, the iron and aluminum atoms diffuse into each other, forming a series of intermetallic phases and a liquid aluminum-rich fcc phase. This liquid phase exists between intermetallic phases. On cooling, the liquid fcc phase solidifies on the intermetallic phases and grows into the casting, resulting in soldering. The critical temperature is the eutectic temperature near the aluminum corner of the phase diagram. If the die is protected using a nonreactive ceramic coating, soldering starts at locations where local coating failure occurs. Molten aluminum comes into contact with die steel through the coating failure locations and eats into the steel matrix, forming small pits. As these small pits grow, the coating is gradually removed and soldering becomes more severe. Details of die soldering step on a bare steel die and on a coated die material are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{technology}} of Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM) {{is not very}} new. For hundreds of years wooden parts are built by stacking layers together. Nowadays also paper, plastic, ceramic composite and metal sheets are treated in layers. For the manufacture of prototypes and especially technical tools, e. g. moulds for gravity <b>casting,</b> die <b>casting</b> <b>or</b> injection <b>molding,</b> out of metallic foil however the low self stiffness of this material is a great challenge. In this case {{it is useful to}} produce the parts in a two step process. The first sub-process is the stacking of the layers, which can be realised by laser beam spot welding to determine the position of the layer in combination with generating the defined contour by a laser beam cutting process. This procedure is done in a fully automated machine where the CAD-file of the desired part and the building parameters like the laser parameters and the cutting velocity are needed as input. However the stability of the produced green part is insufficient for most kind of application. Hence, a second sub-process to enhance the mechanical properties of the part is necessary. This can for example be realised by high temperature soldering or by diffusion welding in a furnace with inert gas or vacuum. During these kinds of joining processes the green part is homogeneously pressed {{with the help of a}} powder bed and at the same time it is tempered for a defined term...|$|R
