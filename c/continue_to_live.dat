5|$|On 22 January 2010, {{the last}} album, L'OuvreTemps (The Time Opener), was published. With this album the authors {{concluded}} the entire comic {{series with the}} intention to prevent the series from becoming weak, or staggering behind newer comics. However, Christin has written a 270-page Valérian and Laureline novel, Valérian et Laureline: Lininil a disparu (Valérian and Laureline: Lininil Has Disappeared), and indicated that Valérian and Laureline will <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> on in a yet unspecified form.|$|E
5|$|The Body Burner– Granted Kratos passage into Pandora's Temple. The Body Burner was {{the first}} warrior to die while seeking Pandora's Box. He was cursed by the gods to <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> as a rotting corpse and act as {{custodian}} of the Temple, where he burned the dead bodies that the harpies brought to him. The character was voiced by Christopher Corey Smith in God of War.|$|E
5|$|The Chimariko also {{suffered}} heavily when European prospectors entered {{the region in}} the 19th century searching for gold. After clashing with the Europeans, many members of the tribe were dispersed to Shasta territory or killed. Some returned to the Trinity River in the late 19th century, after the gold seekers had left. People of Chimariko ancestry <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in the region, although the tribe functionally no longer exists.|$|E

5|$|The eggs hatch {{in about}} 7 days. The mother may assist the nymphs in hatching. When the nymphs hatch, they eat the egg casing and <b>{{continue}}</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with the mother. The nymphs look {{similar to their}} parents, only smaller, and will nest under their mother and she will continue to protect them until their second molt. The nymphs feed on food regurgitated by the mother, and on their own molts. If the mother dies before the nymphs are ready to leave, the nymphs may eat her.|$|E
5|$|Marcus Schouler brings Trina Sieppe, {{his cousin}} and {{intended}} fiancée, into McTeague's office for dental work. Schouler and McTeague are friends and McTeague gladly agrees to examine her. As {{they wait for}} an opening, Trina buys a lottery ticket. McTeague becomes enamored with Trina and begs Schouler for permission to court Trina. After seeing McTeague's conviction, Schouler agrees. Trina eventually agrees to marry McTeague and shortly afterwards her lottery ticket wins her $5,000. Schouler bitterly claims that the money should have been his, causing a rift between McTeague and Schouler. After McTeague and Trina wed, they <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in their small apartment with Trina refusing to spend her $5,000.|$|E
5|$|Vrba's {{marriage}} ended {{around this}} time. In 1958 {{he received an}} invitation to an international conference in Israel, and while there he defected. He worked {{for the next two}} years at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot. He said later that he could not <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in Israel because the same men who had, in his view, betrayed the Jewish community in Hungary were now in positions of power there. In 1960 he moved instead to England, where he worked for two years in the Neuropsychiatric Research Unit in Carshalton, Surrey, and seven years for the Medical Research Council. He became a British subject by naturalization on 4 August 1966.|$|E

5|$|After metamorphosis, {{young adults}} may {{disperse}} into terrestrial habitats or <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in water. Almost all frog species are carnivorous as adults, preying on invertebrates, including arthropods, worms, snails, and slugs. A {{few of the}} larger ones may eat other frogs, small mammals, and fish. Some frogs use their sticky tongues to catch fast-moving prey, while others push food into their mouths with their hands. A few species also eat plant matter; the tree frog Xenohyla truncata is partly herbivorous, its diet including {{a large proportion of}} fruit, Leptodactylus mystaceus has been found to eat plants, and folivory occurs in Euphlyctis hexadactylus, with plants constituting 79.5% of its diet by volume. Adult frogs are themselves attacked by many predators. The northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) is eaten by herons, hawks, fish, large salamanders, snakes, raccoons, skunks, mink, bullfrogs, and other animals.|$|E
5|$|After {{more than}} 210years of {{relations}} with the Spanish, both indigenous societies lost cohesiveness. Official records indicate that survivors of war and disease were transported to Havana in the late 18th century. Isolated groups may have been assimilated into the Seminole nation, which formed in northern Florida when a band of Creeks consolidated surviving members of pre-Columbian societies in Florida into their own to become a distinct tribe. Seminoles were forced into the Everglades by the U.S. military during the Seminole Wars from 1835 to 1842. The U.S. military pursued the Seminoles into the region, which resulted {{in some of the}} first recorded explorations of much of the area. Seminoles <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in the Everglades region, and support themselves with casino gambling on six reservations located throughout the state.|$|E
5|$|After the {{formation}} of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic in July 1940, Gens was fired from his job. He was unable to secure a work permit nor was he allowed to <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in Kaunas. He went to live with his brother, Solomon, in Vilnius, and although Gens was on a list to be sent to Soviet labor camps, he managed to secure an unregistered job at the Vilnius health department through an old military colleague, Colonel Juozas Ūsas. Gens was not on the official payroll, which meant that the political officer attached to the hospital {{did not need to be}} informed of his employment. During June 1941, when thousands of the Lithuanian elites were exiled to Siberia, Gens remained in hiding and was not deported.|$|E

5|$|Documents {{indicate}} the Gurdons or Gordons occupied the village {{from at least}} the 13th century when Sir Adam de Gurdon held property. In 1472 the Gurdon holding was purchased by Winchester College who would increasingly grow to dominate the parish over the next 500 years. The Sandals holding later merged with the Gurdons and documents exist indicating {{the existence of the}} Sandals in 1255 and another in 1329, witnessed by a John de Sandale. For centuries, village life centred on the old farm holdings of the Manor; the Shelleys, Freres, Sandals and Gurdons (now merged into Old House Farm), and the Heathers, Clays, Porters, Park, Smiths and some descendants of these families <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in the village today and many old farm buildings still exist. The naturalist and ornithologist Gilbert White immortalised the localities of the region, including East Worldham, in his The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789).|$|E
5|$|However much it was believed, the king's divine {{status was}} the {{rationale}} {{for his role as}} Egypt's representative to the gods, as he formed a link between the divine and human realms. The Egyptians believed the gods needed temples to dwell in, as well as the periodic performance of rituals and presentation of offerings to nourish them. These things were provided by the cults that the king oversaw, with their priests and laborers. Yet, according to royal ideology, temple-building was exclusively the pharaoh's work, as were the rituals that priests usually performed in his stead. These acts were a part of the king's fundamental role: maintaining maat. The king and the nation he represented provided the gods with maat so they could continue to perform their functions, which maintained maat in the cosmos so humans could <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>live.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{successfully}} rendezvous in time {{to bring}} aboard the new host, a female (Nicole Orth-Pallavicini), much to Dr. Crusher's surprise. She helps with the other Trill to transplant Odan into the new host, and both Riker and Odan fully recover. When Odan attempts to continue their relationship, Dr. Crusher is uncomfortable, knowing both that the Trill appear to have no preferences on gender orientation, and that Odan will <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> on {{in any number of}} hosts' bodies. Odan admits he still loves Dr. Crusher, but understands her confusion and discomfort, and promises to never forget her or their short time together. And Dr. Crusher replies that she loves Odan too; in Odan's new, female host body, Odan then kisses the inner wrist of her hand.|$|E

5|$|In England {{he met the}} King {{on several}} {{occasions}} and dined {{with a number of}} influential British politicians, including William Pitt, Charles James Fox and Edmund Burke. Metternich was nominated the new Minister Plenipotentiary to the Austrian Netherlands and left England in September 1794. Unfortunately, he found an exiled and powerless government in headlong retreat from the latest French advance. In October a revitalised French army swept into Germany and annexed all of the Metternich estates except Königswart. Disappointed, and affected by strong criticism of his father's policies, he joined his parents in Vienna in November. On 27 September 1795 he married Countess Eleonore von Kaunitz, a granddaughter of former Austrian chancellor Wenzel Kaunitz. The marriage was arranged by Metternich's mother and introduced him to Viennese society. This was undoubtedly part of the motivation for Metternich, who demonstrated less affection for her than she for him. Two conditions were imposed by the father of the bride, Prince Kaunitz: first, the still youthful Eleonore was to <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> at home; and second, Metternich was forbidden from serving as a diplomat as long as the Prince was still alive. Their daughter Maria was born in January 1797.|$|E
5|$|The Mikea are hunter-gatherers (also called foragers) who {{practice}} limited farming. The Mikea label {{is applied to}} those who live this subsistence lifestyle rather than being tied to a specific ethnicity. There are numerous groups termed Mikea along the west and southwest coast of Madagascar, with the majority living {{in and around the}} spiny Mikea Forest on the southwestern coast between Morombe and Toliara, an area extending 2500 square kilometers. Historically this main concentration of Mikea may have extended as far south as the Fiherenana River and as far north as the Mangoky River; another main cluster of Mikea live to the west and southwest of Lake Ihotry. They are typically considered a subset of the Sakalava ethnic group, although there are Mikea individuals who trace their origins to other ethnic groups. Their adherence to a way of life perceived by villagers and city dwellers as ancestral has contributed to a mystique and various myths and legends about them, and many Malagasy believe they are the descendents of Vazimba, the original inhabitants of the island, although {{there is no evidence to}} support this view. The majority of Malagasy believe the existence of the Mikea to be a myth and are unaware that any Malagasy <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> the Mikea lifestyle to the present day. The term Mikea is principally used by outsiders to label this group and is not often used by members of this community themselves. Most Mikea prefer to call themselves either Vezo-Mikea or Masikoro-Mikea, depending on their specific family lineages.|$|E
