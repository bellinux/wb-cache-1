Home's premiership was the second briefest of the twentieth century, lasting two days short of a year. Among the legislation passed under his government was the abolition of resale price maintenance, bringing <b>costs</b> <b>down</b> for the consumer against the interests of producers of food and other commodities.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, {{sequestration}} {{budget cuts}} {{cast doubt on}} the USAF's ability to complete the Combat Avionics Programmed Extension Suite (CAPES), a part of secondary programs such as Taiwan's F-16 upgrade. ACC's General Mike Hostage stated that if he only had money for SLEP (service life extension program) or CAPES, he would fund SLEP to keep the aircraft flying. Lockheed Martin responded to talk of CAPES cancellation with a fixed-price upgrade package for foreign users. CAPES {{was not included in the}} Pentagon's 2015 budget request. The USAF said that the upgrade package will still be offered to Taiwan, and Lockheed said that some common elements with the F-35 will keep the radar's unit <b>costs</b> <b>down.</b> In 2014 the USAF issued a RFI to SLEP 300 F-16 C/Ds.|$|E
5|$|The first president, Joseph R. Williams, {{designed}} {{a curriculum that}} required more scientific study than practically any undergraduate institution of the era. It balanced science, liberal arts, and practical training. The curriculum excluded Latin and Greek studies since most applicants did not study any classical languages in their rural high schools. However, it did require three hours of daily manual labor, which kept <b>costs</b> <b>down</b> for both {{the students and the}} College. Despite Williams' innovations and his defense of education for the masses, the State Board of Education saw Williams' curriculum as elitist. They forced him to resign in 1859 and reduced the curriculum to a two-year vocational program.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, pre-production {{began again}} {{on a film}} with a treatment called Planet of the Titans and subsequent script produced by British writers Chris Bryant and Allan Scott {{with the intention of}} keeping <b>costs</b> <b>down</b> by filming in the United Kingdom. There were difficulties in ensuring that both William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy were signed to the film as Shatner's deal with Paramount had expired and Nimoy was concerned with unauthorized merchandising. Philip Kaufman was signed up to direct, after several others were asked first. The plot would have seen the crew investigating the homeworld of the mythical Titans, and in escaping through a black hole are hurled into the prehistoric past where they teach early man how to make fire.|$|E

5|$|The scenes set in Cyprus were filmed on {{location}} in Deià, a coastal village in the island of Majorca. Previously working on a film using the same location, producer Chris Fry chose the village because {{he felt it was}} the closest to the UK the crew can get to mimic the hot, Mediterranean feel of Cyprus. Because filming abroad tend to be costly for a BBC budget, the producers kept <b>costs</b> <b>down</b> as much as possible by using a limited crew with some local help. Much of the original script was to take place inside a house, but because there were no gaffers responsible for lighting, and that the weather was decent, filming took place primarily outside because of the natural sunlight. The filming crew spent four days at the end of April shooting in Majorca.|$|E
