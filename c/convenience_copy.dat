Sixteen Web bibliographies were analyzed for uses of two different recommended sources: (1) the tagged title; (2) the title as it would appear to be from viewing the beginning of the page in the browser (apparent title). In all sixteen, the proportion of tagged titles was much less than that of apparent titles, and only rarely did the bibliography title match the tagged title and not the apparent title. <b>Convenience</b> of <b>copying</b> may partly explain the preference for the apparent title.

40|$|We have {{reviewed}} the draft Market Regulation ACA Provisions document exposed for comments due September 5, 2013 {{and would like}} to offer the following comments and suggestions. First, a general comment that we appreciate that the Market Conduct Exam Standards Working Group is beginning its work on exam standards related to the Affordable Care Act now. This is important work and will take some time to develop, so we applaud the working group for starting the process {{and we will continue to}} provide comments and information along the way. We support the list of provisions as they exist in the draft exposed for comments due today. We would encourage the working group to add a provision to the list so that exam standards can be developed regarding the nondiscrimination provisions outlined in section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act. These provisions became effective on March 23, 2010. This provision applies existing civil rights protections to private health insurance and prohibits discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability. In July, the Georgetown Center on Health Insurance Reforms published a paper regarding this provision.

40|$|Abstract: Emotional {{intelligence}} (EI) {{is concerned}} with personal and behavioural attributes that enable individuals or organisations to performup to an acceptable standard. Construction industry is composed of stakeholders of individuals and organisations working towards a common purpose of providing value for clients' money. This study is designed to evaluate the benefit of EI {{to the performance of}} construction projects. Using survey approach, primary data was collected by the use of a well-structured questionnaire. Adopting <b>convenience</b> sampling method, <b>copies</b> of questionnaire were distributed to construction project managers (CPM), architects, quantity surveyors (QS), construction managers (CM), facility managers (FM) and engineers in the South African construction industry and the retrieved copies were analysed. From the findings, it can be concluded that EI does not only hold the key to overall improvement of the project, but will also improve communication among construction clients and the entire team members;this will result in improved relationships among construction professionals and other stakeholders for the achievement of better performance of construction projects. It is therefore necessary for professionals and other stakeholders in the construction industry to improve on their intelligence quota by taking intelligence test at various time. Materials such as books, articles andso on on EI shouldalso be consultedfor individual improvement...|$|R
40|$|Oracle Auto Service Request (ASR) is a secure, scalable, customer-installable {{software}} feature of warranty and Oracle Support Services that provides auto-case generation when common hardware component faults occur. ASR {{is designed to}} enable faster problem resolution by eliminating the need to initiate contact with Oracle Support Services for common hardware component failures, reducing both the number of phone calls needed and overall phone time required. ASR also simplifies support operations by using electronic diagnostic data. Easily installed and deployed, ASR is completely controlled by you, the customer, to ensure security. ASR is applicable only for component faults. Not all component failures are covered, though the most common components (such as disk, fan, and power supplies) are covered. Note: ASR is not a system management or monitoring tool; {{it is designed to}} automatically open Oracle Service Requests when specific faults are detected on Oracle products that are qualified for ASR.

40|$|The {{role of the}} Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCO) in England was {{established}} in the 1994 Special Educational Needs (SEN) Code of Practice (DfE, 1994) which stated that all mainstream schools must have a SENCO responsible for coordinating services around children with SEN and helping teachers develop and implement appropriate provision for these children. A similar role exists in other European countries such as Sweden and Ireland. Since 1994, the SENCO role in the UK has changed as various policies continually redefined SEN provisions (DfES, 2001 a; DfES, 2001 b; DCSF, 2004). This paper focuses on the data gathered through questionnaires and interviews relating to the impact that SENCOs have on teachers’ capacity to address SEN in their classrooms. The issue is timely now that the intended legislation, ‘Support and Aspiration: a New Approach to Special Educational Needs and Disability’ (DfE, 2011) plans to end “the bias towards the inclusion” of children with special needs in mainstream schools. This particular statement has caused much furore within the Special Needs community, particularly amongst SENCOs, whose principal guidance, the Revised SEN Code of Practice (2001) promotes the inclusion for children with SEN in mainstream schools. Since SENCOs are central to supporting children’s inclusion and achievement, the research centres around three specific The aims of my research thus can be detailed as follows: •	To investigate the degree to which SENCOs are able to successfully motivate the teachers who have children with SEN in their classrooms to confidently manage the needs of these students. •	To consider the various factors through which SENCOs contribute to the teachers’ skills of dealing with the students who have SEN and the perceived success of such skills. •	To identify which elements (interventions, resources, training, etc) most positively impact the success of the SENCO–teacher interactions This study investigates how SENCOs enable teachers to take ownership of SEN teaching in their classroom, and to what degree teachers feel that SENCO’s support enables them to ‘successfully’ and independently meet the needs of children with SEN. Moreover, the study also explores whether the teachers’ views are shared with the views of the SENCO in question in each setting. The Study: The overall design of the study revolves around an interpretative mixed-methods approach (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2007; Robson, 2011). Creswell (1998, pp. 51 - 52) illustrates this particular kind of study, as a one in which individuals will be asked to “describe their everyday lived experiences” as related to the phenomenon under investigation. In the specific case of this project, the phenomenon pertains to the SENCO-teacher interaction {{and its impact on the}} teachers’ abilities to address and manage the needs of children with SEN, including those with behavioural issues, in English Primary Schools. Research Population: This research project engages with a purposive sample of SENCOs from the UK ‘National Award for SEN Coordination’ Course. This course is mandatory professional development for all new to role SENCOs and those who had been working in their respective schools in the SENCO role for less than 12 months prior to September 2009 (DCSF, 2009 a). The selection criteria for this sample, was accessed through the researcher’s academic contacts involved in course delivery, was based primarily on the fact that all participants are currently actively in post as SENCOs. Furthermore, a secondary basis for selection involved the convenience of access to such a sample based upon limitations and time constraints. Research Instruments: The main instruments used for data collection were a self-completion questionnaire with closed and open-ended questions (Robson, 2011), which was then used as the basis for semi-structured in-depth interviews. Data was sought via the survey instrument that was divided into the following sections: demographic information; employment status and responsibilities, SENCO-teacher interactions; and classroom interventions. The questionnaire was developed and based on the researcher’s previous work around the challenges faced by SENCOs in English Primary schools, as well as previous studies (Cole, 2003; Garner and Davies, 2001; Pearson and Ralph, 2007; Szwed, 2007 b) in this area. The questionnaire essentially sought data about SENCOs perceptions of their own role, in terms of the support they provide to teachers. These then informed the semi-structured interviews which were carried out for a research sample of 18 SENCOs and 18 Teachers. Triangulation of data (Creswell, 1994; Bell, 2005), so as to try to ensure the verification and validity of data (Silverman, 2010) was ensured through a three-pronged methodological approach including questionnaire and interview data, document scrutiny and a critical review and evaluation of past and current research in the area. Data Collection: A pre-questionnaire preparatory phase was undertaken. This involved preparation of a draft questionnaire built upon an initial analysis of previously published research which was then reviewed in a peer support group, gaining feedback from other researchers, and further, piloting the survey with three SENCOs. This pilot phase ensured increased reliability, validity and practicability of the questionnaire (Cohen, Manion and Morrison, 2007). Additionally, the pilot informed the researcher’s ability to ensure manageability of data collected at the point of final dissemination, through a process of refining and rephrasing questions as per the peer group and pilot participant SENCOs’ feedback. The questionnaire (see Appendix 1) was then distributed to the Primary School SENCOs on the UK ‘National Award for SEN Coordination’ Course with the consent and support of the course leaders. The researcher spoke in person, briefly about the project, and the intended informational benefits of the research outcomes to those SENCOs who participate. Questionnaires were then distributed by the researcher to participants at the end of a course session, for them to post back in prepaid envelopes at their <b>convenience.</b> Altogether 221 <b>copies</b> of the questionnaire survey for primary school SENCOs were distributed across six UK ‘National Award for SEN Coordination’ Course cohorts, involving five Local Authorities.
