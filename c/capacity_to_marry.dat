40|$|In my {{dissertation}} thesis I {{tried to}} explicate the fundamental institutes of Islamic family law, according to modern and contemporary legislation {{in a number}} of Arab states. The family law is fairly exhaustively treated in the sacred book of Muslims, in Koran, albeit {{in a number of}} scattered passages, mostly in suras from Medinese period. These passages are defined with more precision by the prestigeous method of the interpretation of Koran, with so called taj<;ir and thanks to collected statements of the Prophet Muhammad and his companions, constituting the tradition, so called swma. And the modern and contemporary legislation is based rigid on it with some westernized elements. After a brief acquaintance comprehension of the personal statute in contemporary Near Eastern countries is described in detail. The next chapter contains the description of the sense of marriage in Islamic law in three aspects- legal, social and religious. It is a contract of civil law concluded by the bridegroom with the legal guardian of the bride, so called wali. After this I continue through the short characterization of conditions of the conclusion of the marriage, for example form and <b>capacity,</b> limitations <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> any person of the opposite sex, special time period cidda [...] .

30|$|Among Chinese youth, {{attitudes and}} {{expectations}} concerning dating and intimate relationships will also likely vary between females and males. In terms of dating and partner preferences, researchers have noted a considerable {{difference between the}} sexes, with a substantial double standard still prevailing (Piotrowski et al. 2016). For men, the ideal quality in a woman is beauty, while for women, the ideal quality in a man is intelligence (Xia and Zhou 2003). Generally, Chinese women are expected <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> at an earlier age, while they are still {{at the peak of}} their physical appearance and <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> bear children, whereas men are expected <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> at a later age, after they have achieved financial success (Piotrowski et al. 2016). Recent studies suggest that stereotyped perceptions of young men and women exist (Jankowiak and Li 2014). Men are more often regarded as serious, ambitious, stubborn, deceitful, independent, and powerful, while women are viewed as quiet, anxious, excitable, gentle, depressed, shy, and jealous (Jankowiak and Li 2014).|$|R
2500|$|While the act {{could not}} have been {{challenged}} under the Charter, the definition of marriage is outside the power of the Provincial Government, or ultra vires, and therefore invalid. The Constitution Act, 1867, is universally interpreted as giving provinces jurisdiction over only the solemnization of marriage, while all other aspects, including <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry,</b> are under federal jurisdiction. At the time Bill 202 was passed, Justice Minister David Hancock did not support it, saying: [...] "In terms of legal effect, I'm convinced it doesn't have any." [...] Hancock subsequently stated that he believes the act to be constitutionally valid and that Alberta will attempt to uphold it. Following the December 9, 2004 Supreme Court response to the federal reference of same-sex marriage, Hancock's successor, Ron Stevens, conceded that the Bill 202 amendments to the Marriage Act would likely be struck down as unconstitutional on account of its encroachment into what had by then been explicitly ruled a matter of federal jurisdiction.|$|E
