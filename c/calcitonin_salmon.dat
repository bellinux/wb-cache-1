Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the absorption enhancing potential of Pheroid technology and TMC (N-trimethyl chitosan chloride), a chitosan derivative, on the peroral administration of <b>salmon</b> <b>calcitonin.</b> Methods: The research strategy was to administer <b>salmon</b> <b>calcitonin,</b> a large polar peptide drug with a known stability profile and quantitive therapeutic effect, alone and in combinations with two different Pheroid formulations and two derivatives of chitosan namely TMC and TMO to the jejunum mucosal surface of laboratory rats. Entrapment of calcitonin in Pheroids were confirmed and analyzed with CLSM. In vivo studies were conducted on Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were fasted for 24 hours. The carotis communis was cannulated for the collection of blood samples after 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes. An incision was made to the abdomen of the rats to ligate the jejunum were the different formulations of Pheroid microsponges and vesicles and TMC and TMO with <b>salmon</b> <b>calcitonin</b> (500 IU/kg) were injected. Blood samples were collected immediately and centrifuged. Serum was stored at - 40 OC until analysis. Analyses were done with a Radio Immuno Assay. Results: With both Pheroid technology and TMC greater concentrations of <b>salmon</b> <b>calcitonin</b> were observed as with <b>salmon</b> <b>calcitonin</b> in saline.

We investigated the effects of oral <b>salmon</b> <b>calcitonin</b> treatment and ovariectomy on cartilage and bone pathology in a traumatic OA model. MethodsSix groups with 10 7 -month-old female Sprague Dawley rats each were subjected to bilateral meniscectomy (MNX), ovariectomy (OVX) or Sham surgery and treated for 8 weeks with oral <b>salmon</b> <b>calcitonin</b> (CT) or vehicle (V) in the following way: (1) Sham+V; (2) MNX+V; (3) MNX+CT; (4)  OVX+V; (5) MNX/OVX+V; (6) MNX/OVX+CT. Weights were recorded weekly and CTX-II was measured in serum. At termination 56 days post-surgery, the right tibia was analyzed for changes in articular cartilage thickness, extent of cartilage damage and subchondral bone changes in predefined zones, as recommended in the novel OARSI histopathology score. ResultsThe combined MNX/OVX model produced a significantly reduced cartilage thickness (P= 0. 033) in the outer zone (Z 1) of the tibial plateau and increased calcified cartilage damage (P= 0. 0004) and serum CTX-II (P= 0. 003).

40|$|The {{attractive}} {{properties of}} peptides and proteins as therapeutic agents {{and the challenges}} faced by the oral delivery of such agents have been the primary motivation for the design and development of novel oral delivery systems that could circumvent biological barriers. In this work, <b>salmon</b> <b>calcitonin,</b> a 32 amino acid polypeptide hormone used {{in the treatment of}} bone diseases, such as Paget 2 ̆ 7 s disease, hypercalcemia and osteoporosis, was employed as the model protein. ^ The main goal of this work was the creation of pH-sensititive hydrogel microspheres composed of Poly(methacrylic acid-grafted-polyethylene glycol)) (PMAA-g-EG), their primary characterization, and the examination of their performance as a transport enhancer for <b>salmon</b> <b>calcitonin.</b> For this purpose, a gastrointestinal cell culture model, the Caco- 2 cell line, was employed to investigate the cytotoxic effects of the polymeric carrier, its effects on the cell monolayer integrity, and its ability to enhance the transport of <b>salmon</b> <b>calcitonin.</b> ^ Microsphere carriers composed of P(MAA-g-EG) hydrogels were successfully created by dispersion polymerization utilizing deionize water as the solvent. The characterization of these systems was performed by FTIR revealed that microspheres created by dispersion polymerization possessed similar infrared spectral characteristics to hydrogel films prepared with the same monomer ratio. These hydrogels also possessed narrow particle size distribution and spherical shape as evidenced by PCS and SEM analysis. ^ The examination of the physicochemical interactions of the P(MAA-g-EG) microsphere system with Caco- 2 cell monolayers revealed that these systems possessed low cytotoxicity and were capable of opening the tight junctions between epithelial cells by significantly reducing the transepithelial electrical resistance. The presence of P(MAA-g-EG) microspheres significantly increased the transport of paracellularly transported molecules such as 14 C-mannitol and fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran when compared to controls. Fluorescein sodium salt solutions were also investigated as an actively transported molecule. The transport of fluorescein was highly affected by PEG chains. <b>Salmon</b> <b>calcitonin</b> transport was significantly enhanced {{in the presence of the}} microspheres. The main transport mechanism for <b>salmon</b> <b>calcitonin</b> through epithelial cell monolayers was found to be mainly paracellular. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{effect of}} intermittent low-dose nasal <b>salmon</b> <b>calcitonin</b> on trabecular early postmenopausal bone loss was assessed as follow-up to a previously published study. Randomized controlled group comparison {{was made of}} 287 healthy women with 6 - 36 months of natural menopause and no treatment interfering with calcium metabolism at an outpatient clinic for research in bone and cartilage metabolism. The 287 women were randomly allocated to 3 years of treatment with either 500 mg/day, 5 days/week of calcium or {{the same amount of}} calcium plus 50 IU/day, 5 days per week of nasal <b>salmon</b> <b>calcitonin.</b> A total of 186 women complied with the study protocol throughout. The main outcome measures were bone mineral density of the lumbar spine (DPA) and biochemical parameters reflecting bone turnover (serum alkaline phosphatases, urinary calcium/creatinine, and hydroxyproline/creatinine ratio). The average changes in bone mineral density after 36 months showed a positive (p < 0. 05) outcome (1. 8 +/- 5. 7 %; mean +/- SD) in the group treated with <b>salmon</b> <b>calcitonin</b> and calcium and a significant (p < 0. 01) loss (- 5. 8 +/- 4. 8 %) in patients receiving calcium alone. The difference between the evolution of the two groups was significantly (p < 0. 01) different after 6 months of treatment and remained so {{until the end of the}} study. No significant changes were recorded in biochemical parameters reflecting bone turnover. As previously shown during a 1 year follow-up, nasal <b>salmon</b> <b>calcitonin</b> given at low dose and intermittently, in association with calcium, can counteract trabecular postmenopausal bone loss.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{investigate}} both {{prophylactic and}} therapeutic roles of <b>salmon</b> <b>calcitonin</b> on the articular cartilage of rabbit's knees. MethodsRight knee instability {{was produced in}} 30 New Zealand white rabbits by sectioning the cranial cruciate ligament (CCL). Animals were separated into four groups: placebo prophylactic-stage group (n= 6), killed 8 weeks post surgery, calcitonin prophylactic-stage group (n= 6), treated immediately after surgery with <b>salmon</b> <b>calcitonin</b> and killed at 8 weeks, placebo therapeutic-stage group (n= 9) killed at 16 weeks post surgery and calcitonin therapeutic-stage group (n= 9), treated with <b>salmon</b> <b>calcitonin</b> from 8 th to 16 th week and killed at 16 weeks post surgery. A histomorphometric study {{was based on the}} morphological changes of the articular cartilage and subchondral bone (degeneration indexes), as well as the articular cartilage thickness, chondrocytes' arrangement and their metabolic activity (regeneration indexes). ResultsCalcitonin groups showed smoother articular surface, no or minimal signs of ulceration, smaller osteophytes, and less subchondral cystic formation than placebo groups. Normal distribution of chondrocytes or hypercellularity was noticed in areas of mild osteoarthritic (OA) changes in the calcitonin groups indicating regeneration activity. Periodic Acid Schiff's and Alcian blue staining were negative in the placebo groups while increased absorption in the calcitonin groups revealed high anabolic activity. ConclusionsIn prophylactic stages <b>salmon</b> <b>calcitonin</b> seemed to inhibit the progression of osteoarthritis by increasing the layers of hyaline cartilage, restoring the cellular metabolism, and decreasing the volume of osteophytes. In therapeutic stages, the hormone had a healing effect by decreasing the subchondral cysts, regenerating the hyaline cartilage and restoring cellular metabolism. Both macroscopic and histological findings of this study supported the biochemical results of previous studies showing the therapeutic effect of calcitonin on osteoarthritis...|$|R
