50|$|Another {{technique}} used to increase isolation {{is to use}} an isolated subframe. This splits the system with an additional mass/spring/damper system. This doubles the high frequency attenuation rolloff, {{at the cost of}} introducing additional low frequency modes which may cause the low frequency behaviour to deteriorate. This is commonly used in the rear suspensions of cars with Independent Rear Suspension (IRS), and in the front subframes of some cars. The graph (see illustration) shows the force into the body for a subframe that is rigidly bolted to the body compared with the red curve that shows a <b>compliantly</b> mounted subframe. Above 42 Hz the <b>compliantly</b> mounted subframe is superior, but below that frequency the bolted in subframe is better.|$|E
50|$|Some {{companies}} still offer {{variations on}} these schemes {{so it can}} be confusing to a contractor to know what is legal and what is not.

50|$|Another {{arrangement}} uses a radiating dome {{in place}} of the usual dust-cap; it is acoustically active. In most speaker drivers such dust-caps are constructed so as to be relatively acoustically inert. Sometimes the dust-cap {{takes the form of a}} small conical shape, claimed to improve dispersion at higher frequencies. Yet other designs simply modify the diaphragm and dome/whizzer materials instead of <b>compliantly</b> coupling the diaphragm to achieve full-range operation.|$|E
50|$|In some designs, {{the main}} {{diaphragm}} may be coupled {{to the voice}} coil using a compliant bond such that high frequency vibrations are not transmitted into it, but instead move the whizzer cone. The technique of using a <b>compliantly</b> coupled (or modified) diaphragm for the low frequencies and auxiliary whizzer or modified dust-cap (dome) for the high frequency response of a speaker is a mechanical implementation of an audio crossover.|$|E

5000|$|The systems-centered methods which {{developed}} from the theory of living human systems offers a map of predictable phases {{for the development of}} human systems. [...] In the first phase of development, a system comes to terms with the issues of giving and taking authority and with the authority that resides in the members. Successful management of this phase leads to cooperation between members and between members and leaders. Unsuccessful management of this phase results in members behaving defiantly or <b>compliantly</b> which inevitably undermines the group's development.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the patron}} of Martin Luther, Johann {{maintained}} a very close, almost friendly {{relationship with the}} leading theologian of the Protestants. Luther also often expressed a positive opinion about John. Especially for his behavior at the Augsburg Diet in 1530, he praised him very much: [...] "I am sure that the Elector Johann of Saxony had the Holy Spirit. In Augsburg he proved this admirably by his confession. John said, [...] "Tell my scholars {{that they are doing}} what is right, praise and honor God, and take no regard for me or my country." [...] By his insistence on the Protestant profession of faith, he is even to dismiss the Protestant theologians that behave too <b>compliantly</b> to the emperor.|$|E

However the Instruction of Any is distinguished from earlier works, as its intended audience was the ordinary person rather than the aristocracy. The themes covered by the instructions include respect for religion, motherhood, honesty, restraint and the avoidance of relations with unfaithful women. Unlike other works of instruction, the endings of which tend towards acquiescence and gratitude for the wisdom imparted, this text contains an epilogue in which a son first responds to his father's maxims critically rather than <b>compliantly.</b> The father refutes the son's objections by force of argument.|$|E
5000|$|Texas Monthly found Harris more {{interested}} in social parties than his own Republican Party. Texas Monthly said that Harris [...] "has {{a long history of}} talking like a Republican back home but voting <b>compliantly</b> with the Democratic Senate leadership.". Harris referred most GOP matters to his Tarrant County colleague, Betty Andujar of Fort Worth. In 1976, Harris joined U.S. Senator John G. Tower of Texas in supporting President Gerald R. Ford, Jr., for nomination to a full term in the first ever Texas primary in which presidential convention delegates were chosen by voters. Ford, however, was defeated 2-1 in the primary by a coalition supporting Ronald W. Reagan, headed by cochairmen Ernest Angelo of Midland, Ray Barnhart of Pasadena, and Barbara Staff of Dallas, as well as Betty Andujar. Ford ultimately still defeated Reagan at the 1976 Republican National Convention in Kansas City, Missouri.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{standard}} humanoid robots {{mimic the}} human form, but the mechanisms used in {{them are very}} different from those that are in humans. The characteristics of these robots consequently reflect this difference. This places severe limitations on the kinds of interactions standard robots can engage in, the knowledge they can acquire of their environment, and thus on the nature of their cognitive engagement with the environment. Therefore, in 2011, a robotic project was launched in the European Union and it resulted {{in the development of the}} ECCE robot. Led by Professor Owen Holland of the University of Sussex, the ECCE project developed a new kind of robot that was modeled after the human anatomy. ECCE stands for Embodied Cognition in a <b>Compliantly</b> Engineered Robot, and the goal of the project was to develop an anthropomimetic robot whose body moves and interacts with the physical world in the same way flesh human bodies do. As athropomimetic, the robot copies not only the outward shape or form of a human body, but also copies the inner structures and mechanisms, such as bones, joints, muscles, and tendons. With these humanlike mechanisms the robot has the potential for human-like action and interaction in the world.|$|E
5000|$|An {{important}} {{application for}} compliant bonding {{arose in the}} early 1960s, when techniques were developed for fabricating a “beam leaded silicon integrated circuit “chip” consisting of pre-attached electroformed 0.005-inch thick gold leads or “beams” extending from the silicon chip (Figure 5). Thus the beam leaded “chip” eliminated the need to thermosonically bond wires directly onto metallized pads of the fragile silicon chip (as shown in Figure 6) The extended ends of the electroformed beams could then be permanently solid-state bonded to a matching metallized sunburst circuit which has been pre-deposted on a ceramic substrate appropriately packaged in a computer in the making. Figure 7. shows a preshaped hard faced tool thermocompression bonding all of the beam leads of a chip in one bonding cycle. In order to avoid excessively deforming the fine beam leads with the hard bonding tool and putting them at risk of mechanical failure, the applied bonding forces have to be carefully monitored.The invention of compliant bonding eliminated {{the problems associated with}} a hard faced bonding tool and therefore was ideally suited to simultaneously bond all of the extended electroplated gold beam leads to a matching gold metallized sunburst patterned ceramic substrate packaged in a computer (Figure 8). For example, compliant bonding eliminated the problems of using a hard faced bonding tool such as: attempting to uniformly deform the nominally 0.005-inch thick beams leads having slight variations in their thickness; excessive lead deformation that could cause mechanical damage and an ultimate [...] "costly" [...] failure of these fine beam leaded silicon chips which are the [...] "brains" [...] of our computers. The compliant bonding tape media offered the additional advantage of carrying the [...] "beam leaded silicon chip" [...] to the bonding site thus facilitating production. Figures 9. and 10 show that the compliant tape offers the advantage of carrying the beam leaded chip to the bonding site as discussed above. Figure 11 shows a beam leaded silicon integrated circuit <b>compliantly</b> bonded to a gold metallized sunburst pattern deposited on an alumina ceramic substrate which will be encapsulated and packaged in a computer-type device. Figure 12 shows the spent compliant member used to bond the chip in Figure 11 which clearly shows a mirror image of the uniformly bonded beam leads.|$|E

5000|$|In most respects, Climacus did {{not have}} {{problems}} with science or the scientific endeavor. He would not disregard the importance of objective knowledge. Where the scientist or historian finds certainty, however, Climacus noted very accurately that results in science change as the tools of observation change. But Climacus's special interest was in history. His most vehement attacks came against those who believed that they had understood history and its laws—and by doing so could ascertain what a human’s true self is. That is, {{the assumption is that}} by studying history someone can come to know who he really is as a person. Kierkegaard especially accused Hegel's philosophy of falling prey to this assumption. He explained this in, Concluding Unscientific Postscript: [...] It is the existing spirit who asks about truth, presumably because he wants to exist in it, but in any case the questioner is conscious of being an existing individual human being. In this way I believe I am able to make myself understandable to every Greek and to every rational human being. If a German philosopher follows his inclination to put on an act and first transforms himself into a superrational something, just as alchemists and sorcerers bedizen themselves fantastically, in order to answer the question about truth in an extremely satisfying way, this is of no more concern to me than his satisfying answer, which no doubt is extremely satisfying-if one is fantastically dressed up. But whether a German philosopher is or is not doing this can easily be ascertained by anyone who with enthusiasm concentrates his soul on willing to allow himself to be guided by a sage of that kind, and uncritically just uses his guidance <b>compliantly</b> by willing to form his existence according to it. When a person as a learner enthusiastically relates in this way to such a German professor, he accomplishes the most superb epigram upon him, because a speculator of that sort is anything but served by a learner’s honest and enthusiastic zeal for expressing and accomplishing, for existentially appropriating his wisdom, since this wisdom is something that the Herr Professor himself has imagined and has written books about but has never attempted himself. It has not even occurred to him that it should be done. Like the customers clerk who, in the belief that his business was merely to write, wrote what he himself could not read, so there are speculative thinkers who merely write, and write that which, {{if it is to be}} read with the aid of action, if I may put it that way, proves to be nonsense, unless it is perhaps intended only for fantastical beings.

40|$|A {{feedback}} control to generate jumping motions for <b>compliantly</b> actuated multilegged robots is proposed. The method allows {{to specify the}} direction of the jumping motion. This is achieved by a constraint that deﬁnes a one-dimensional submanifold and a bang-bang control which generates a limit cycle on this submanifold. The approach is based on classical impedance control with the difference that the stiffness on the submanifold and the force to preserve a predeﬁned nominal body conﬁguration result from the intrinsic mechanical springs in the joints. Furthermore, we propose two controller implementations: the ﬁrst implementation does not require to detect the contact state, while the second implementation requires contact state detection, but accounts in addition for Coulomb friction constraints.

Thus, the approach achieves the control goal while changing the original plant dynamics only to a minimum extent. Passivity, stability, and convergence properties of the closed-loop dynamics are proven. The performance of the control approach has been experimentally evaluated on the variable stiffness robot arm DLR Hand Arm System, where the stiffness in each of the joints is highly nonlinear. To our best knowledge, this is the first experimentally validated tracking controller for <b>compliantly</b> actuated robots with nonlinear elastic elements...|$|E

30|$|Different {{transgression}} patterns {{across the}} three LCs were identified depending {{on the characteristics of}} the larger area, the LC and station environment, as well as according to rail traffic characteristics. The largest number of pedestrians crossing <b>compliantly</b> and transgressions were counted at Wynnum Central, the second most populated suburb, giving access to the train station through a middle island where crossing is prohibited along the pedestrian corridors for each train passage independently of its direction. In contrast, the largest proportion of transgressions accounting for the total number of people crossing during closures was observed at Coorparoo, the most populated suburb where the total number of people crossing <b>compliantly</b> and transgressing was lower compared to Wynnum Central. Having a similar design comprising the train station at a middle island, the main difference between Coorparoo and Wynnum Central is the presence of a third track and the separately operated pedestrian corridors on {{the two sides of the}} middle island at Coorparoo. On the contrary, Cannon Hill was the least populated suburb with the lowest number of pedestrians observed to cross <b>compliantly</b> and transgressing at this LC not giving access to the train station but to a middle platform separating the three tracks. Contrary to previous findings, the location of the platforms outside of the rail tracks was not associated with a larger number of transgressions. However, a more in depth analysis of the results revealed that at Cannon Hill pedestrians were observed to take the most risk by crossing the largest number of rail tracks where a train could have passed (unoccupied tracks).|$|E
