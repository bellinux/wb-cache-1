5|$|The {{discovery}} of insulin at the University of Toronto in 1921 is {{considered among the}} most significant events {{in the history of}} medicine. The stem cell was discovered at the university in 1963, forming the basis for bone marrow transplantation and all subsequent research on adult and embryonic stem cells. This was the first of many findings at Toronto relating to stem cells, including the identification of pancreatic and retinal stem cells. The <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> was first identified in 1997 by Toronto researchers, who have since found stem cell associations in leukemia, brain tumors and colorectal cancer. Medical inventions developed at Toronto include the glycaemic index, the infant cereal Pablum, the use of protective hypothermia in open heart surgery and the first artificial cardiac pacemaker. The first successful single-lung transplant was performed at Toronto in 1981, followed by the first nerve transplant in 1988, and the first double-lung transplant in 1989. Researchers identified the maturation promoting factor that regulates cell division, and discovered the T cell receptor, which triggers responses of the immune system. The university is credited with isolating the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases. Between 1914 and 1972, the university operated the Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, now part of the pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis. Among the research conducted at the laboratory was the development of gel electrophoresis.|$|E
25|$|A new way {{of looking}} at {{carcinogenesis}} comes from integrating the ideas of developmental biology into oncology. The <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> hypothesis proposes that the different kinds of cells in a heterogeneous tumor arise from a single cell, termed <b>Cancer</b> <b>Stem</b> <b>Cell.</b> Cancer stem cells may arise from transformation of adult stem cells or differentiated cells within a body. These cells persist as a subcomponent of the tumor and retain key stem cell properties. They give rise to a variety of cells, are capable of self-renewal and homeostatic control. Furthermore, the relapse of cancer and the emergence of metastasis are also attributed to these cells. The <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> hypothesis does not contradict earlier concepts of carcinogenesis. The <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> hypothesis has been a proposed mechanism that contributes to tumour heterogeneity.|$|E
25|$|In {{different}} tumor subtypes, cells {{within the}} tumor population exhibit functional heterogeneity and tumors are formed from cells with various proliferative and differentiation capacities.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{summarize}} the {{advances in the}} researches about <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in last 5 years. METHODS: With the keywords "neoplasms, <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> and <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> cells", 2 760 papers published from Jan 1979 to Dec 2008 were searched in the Pubmed databases. Adoptive standards: 1) the surface markers, drug-resistance mechanism and signal transduction pathways of <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> 2) the origin of <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> 3) <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and clinical oncology. According to the adoptive standards, 33 top-quality papers were chosen for reviewing. RESULTS: <b>Cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> have the properties of self-renewal and differentiation, with special cell surface markers and drug-resistance. The signal transduction pathways of <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> including Wnt, Notch, Hedgehog and Bmi- 1 were abnormal. <b>Cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are the origin of malignant tumor's growth, recurrence and metastasis, having {{been the target of}} anti-cancer research. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid {{progress has been made in}} the research about <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> The thorough study on <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> is significant for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis evaluation of malignant tumor.

The university consistently ranks among the top 40 colleges and universities nationwide in federally financed science, engineering, medical, and other research, with a total research budget of around $395 million spread across many departments and research centers, including the Laboratory for Laser Energetics, a laser-based nuclear fusion facility, and the extensive research facilities at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Recently, the university has also engaged {{in a series of}} new initiatives to expand its programs in biomedical engineering and optics, including the construction of the new $37 million Robert B. Goergen Hall for Biomedical Engineering and Optics on the River Campus. Other new research initiatives include a <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> program and a Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute. UR also has the ninth highest technology revenue among U.S. higher education institutions, with $46 million being paid for commercial rights to university technology and research in 2009. Notable patents include Zoloft and Gardasil. WeBWorK, a web-based system for checking homework and providing immediate feedback for students, was developed by University of Rochester professors Gage and Pizer. The system is now in use at over 800 universities and colleges, as well as several secondary and primary schools. Rochester scientists work in diverse areas; for example, physicists developed a technique for etching metal surfaces, such as platinum, titanium and brass, with powerful lasers, enabling self-cleaning surfaces that repel water droplets and will not rust if tilted at a 4 degree angle; and medical researchers are exploring how brains rid themselves of toxic waste during sleep.|$|E

30|$|<b>Cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> {{are a small}} {{population}} of cells in solid tumors or leukaemia [4, 5]. They are characterized as stem cell-like phenotype, capable of self-renewal and differentiation [6, 7]. Many {{studies have shown that}} the role of <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> can not be ignored in many processes such as tumorigenesis, tumor growth, metastasis and tumor progression [4, 8 – 13]. In the course of chemotherapy for breast cancer patients, common chemotherapeutic drugs target non-cancer <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> but the <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> can survive and further cause recurrence or even metastasis due to their own characteristics. Therefore, breast <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are considered to be the key population leading to drug resistance of breast cancer [14, 15]. With the development of molecular markers of breast <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> researchers have found that a small {{population of}} cells, selected by markers, can lead to the initiation of tumors, which further confirms the vital role of <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in tumor initiation [16, 17].|$|R

40|$|<b>Stem</b> <b>cell</b> {{research}} has greatly {{contributed to the}} field of oncology with the identification and isolation of <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> from a variety of tumors. The discovery of rare subpopulations of <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> has indeed entirely changed the focus of cancer research. Normal adult <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> can both self-renew and undergo a differentiation program that, in turn, gives rise to a high number of differentiated <b>cells.</b> Adult <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and their malignant counterparts share almost all of the same intrinsic and extrinsic factors to regulate self-renewal, differentiation and proliferation pathways.

Overall, these observations lead to the conclusion that adult <b>stem</b> or progenitor <b>cells</b> can eventually become malignant by generating <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> which are responsible for the development and maintenance of the tumor mass. In addition, chemo-resistant <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> may cause the relapse of the disease following an apparent beneficial treatment.

2500|$|The <b>cancer</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> model, {{also known}} as the Hierarchical Model proposes that tumors are hierarchically {{organized}} (CSCs lying at the apex (Fig. 3).)

[...] This model suggests that only certain subpopulations of cancer stem cells have the ability to drive the progression of cancer, meaning that there are specific (intrinsic) characteristics that can be identified and then targeted to destroy a tumor long-term without the need to battle the whole tumor.|$|E
