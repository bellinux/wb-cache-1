A NavierStokes/Free wake hybrid method {{was used for}} a physics-based investigation of the Gurney flap effect. A previously trimmed prescribed motion was used for a quick examination of this concept. The 4 -perrevolution normal force at the hub was compared with the loads for a higher harmonic <b>controlled</b> <b>rotor</b> and the baseline rotor. The simulation showed that the proper Gurney flap deployment reduced 80 % of the 4 P normal force vibration, whereas the higher harmonic <b>controlled</b> <b>rotor</b> reduced 53 %. With proper on-board controller, further reduction of the vibration is expected with the Gurney flap. However, the Gurney flap caused blade sectional nose-down pitching moment and altered the trim condition. Thus, additional CFDCSD coupling analysis for aeroelastic deformation and rotor trim is required.

5000|$|A {{number of}} engineers, among them Arthur M. Young in the U.S. and {{radio-control}} aeromodeler Dieter Schlüter in Germany, found that flight stability for helicopters {{could be achieved}} with a stabilizer bar, or flybar. The flybar has a weight or paddle (or both for added stability on smaller helicopters) at each end to maintain a constant plane of rotation. Through mechanical linkages, the stable rotation of the bar mixes with the swashplate movement to damp internal (steering) as well as external (wind) forces on the rotor. This {{makes it easier for}} the pilot to maintain control of the aircraft. Stanley Hiller arrived at a similar method to improve stability by adding short stubby airfoils, or paddles, at each end. However, Hiller's [...] "Rotormatic" [...] system also delivered cyclic control inputs to the main rotor as a sort of <b>control</b> <b>rotor,</b> and the paddles provided the added stability by damping the effects of external forces on the rotor.|$|E
