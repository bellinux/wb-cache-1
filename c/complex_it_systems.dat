40|$|Abstract—Advanced IT {{solutions}} allow {{users to}} create, organize and share user services and computing resources {{across a wide}} range of heterogeneous platforms. This makes managing (updating and deploying) the <b>IT</b> <b>systems</b> considerably more <b>complex.</b> Management tasks are so entangled within the existing components that it requires a IT professional with advanced training and intimate knowledge of the existing configuration to complete them. In this chapter, we will present the deployment solution for a live <b>complex</b> <b>IT</b> <b>system,</b> the Emergency Services Directory (ESD). Many different technologies exist that attempt automate the application deployment process by allowing a user to describe the dependencies, provide the configuration parameters, and specify the application’s required technologies, such as the operating system, database or Web server technology. ESD’s deployment solution takes advantage of the benefits provided by virtualization, and virtual appliances in particular. Each of ESD’s components are wrapped and contained with in a virtual appliance image. To automatically distribute and deploy the virtual appliance image on-demand, we utilize the Cyberaide Creative tool, which is a tool being developed in the on-going Cyberaide project. I...|$|R

5000|$|At {{a similar}} {{time to the}} {{publication}} of the report by Northrop and others, a research and training initiative was being initiated in the UK on Large-scale <b>Complex</b> <b>IT</b> <b>Systems.</b> Many of the challenges recognized in this initiative were the same as, or were similar to those recognized as the challenges of ultra-large-scale systems. [...] Greg Goth quotes Dave Cliff, director of the UK initiative as saying [...] "The ULSS proposal and the LSCITS proposal were written entirely independently, yet we came to very similar conclusions about {{what needs to be done}} and about how to do it". A difference pointed out by Ian Sommerville is that the UK initiative began with a 5 to 10 year vision, while that of Northrop and her co-authors was much longer term. This seems to have led to there being two slightly different perspectives on ultra-large-scale systems. For example, Richard Gabriel's perspective is that ultra-large-scale systems are desirable but currently impossible to build due to limitations in the fields of software design and systems engineering. [...] On the other hand, Ian Sommerville's perspective is that ultra-large-scale systems are already emerging (for example in air traffic control), the key problem being not how to achieve them but how to ensure they are adequately engineered.|$|E
40|$|Large-scale <b>complex</b> <b>IT</b> <b>systems</b> are {{ubiquitous}} {{and many}} organizations, {{for example in}} the financial or healthcare sector, dependent on them. Coordination and control of systems that involve {{a vast number of}} heterogeneous elements requires sophisticated socio-technical approaches that are beyond the established discipline boundaries of computer science. Much of the existing literature is fragmented; thus this review provides an overview of how coordination and control, in relation to large-scale <b>complex</b> <b>IT</b> <b>systems,</b> is comprehended across a range of academic disciplines. Computer science and systems engineering have developed various abstract modelling techniques that are suited to simulate complex behaviour of agents. However, the increase in complexity that these super systems inevitably entail has highlighted a need for different models that can deal with non-deterministic interactions of agents to adequately represent behaviour or responsibilities. While recent applications of probability theory and game theory may provide some answers, advancements in the social sciences have opened up new ways of thinking. System complexity, network scale, and socio-material transformation are well-established angles of inquiry in branches of sociology, politics, and economics that promise to shed light onto issues of uncertainty, standardization, space conceptualization, megaproject initiatives, and cost factors, which are all highly relevant to such systems. Accordingly these interdisciplinary contributions may not only provide new methodologies, but also radically different ways of dealing with material heterogeneity and the implication of network growth, to those concerned with coordination and control in large-scale <b>complex</b> <b>IT</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|E
