50|$|Cholecalciferol, {{also known}} as vitamin D3 and <b>colecalciferol,</b> {{is a type of}} vitamin D found in food and used as a dietary {{supplement}}. As a supplement it is used to treat and prevent vitamin D deficiency including rickets. It is also used for familial hypophosphatemia, hypoparathyroidism that is causing low blood calcium, and Fanconi syndrome. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|Cholecalciferol is {{produced}} industrially {{for use in}} vitamin supplements and to fortify foods. As a pharmaceutical drug it is called cholecalciferol (USAN) or <b>colecalciferol</b> (INN, BAN). It {{is produced}} by the ultraviolet irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol extracted from lanolin found in sheep's wool. Cholesterol is extracted from wool grease and wool wax alcohols obtained from the cleaning of wool after shearing. The cholesterol undergoes a four-step process to make 7-dehydrocholesterol, the same compound that is produced in the skin of animals. The 7-dehydrocholesterol is then irradiated with ultraviolet light. Some unwanted isomers are formed during irradiation: these are removed by various techniques, leaving a resin which melts at about room temperature and usually has a potency of 25,000,000 to 30,000,000 International Units per gram.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Tenofovir-containing {{antiviral}} therapy {{might result}} in acute renal failure {{and is able to}} induce tubular dysfunction with hypocalcemia. On the other hand, hypercalcemia induced by intoxication with <b>colecalciferol</b> has been described to induce renal failure in HIV-positive individuals as well. Here, the authors describe the unusual case of reversible renal failure due to hypercalcemia in a patient with low-dose <b>colecalciferol</b> substitution treated with tenofovir. CASE REPORT: A 31 -year-old HIV-positive female, CDC stage C 3, was admitted to the authors' hospital with progressive renal failure and hypercalcemia. Antiretroviral therapy consisted of tenofovir and emtricitabine in combination with efavirenz. Additionally, she was on low-dose vitamin D(3) substitution (25 microg/d) and calcium supplementation (500 mg/d) due to systemic steroid treatment. CONCLUSION: Additionally to regular control of renal function, serologic level of calcium should be supervised in patients concomitantly treated with tenofovir and <b>colecalciferol...</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Vitamin D is a {{relatively}} inexpensive drug yet an important hormone in terms of calcium and bone homeostasis. Treatment with vitamin D is associated with reduced fracture risk particularly in an elderly population. Therefore, we assessed the budgetary impact of routine prescription of 800 IU daily <b>colecalciferol</b> on hip fracture among older adults in the United Kingdom. Methods: Using meta-analysis findings for treatment effect and UK-estimates of incidence, we performed a health economic evaluation of treating the UK population aged 65 and over with 800 IU of vitamin D daily, assessing the impact upon hip fracture costs using incremental attributable costs and excess mortality {{for a range of}} age- gender-based treatment strategies. Results: Using only a 1 -year horizon, considering only reduction in hip fracture, prescribing <b>colecalciferol</b> 800 IU daily to all adults aged 65 and over, could reduce the number of incident hip fractures from 65, 400 to 45, 700, saving almost 1, 700 associated deaths, whilst saving the UK taxpayer £ 22 million. Conclusions: As the UK government seeks to reduce public expenditure in all sectors, investment in prescribed prophylactic <b>colecalciferol</b> 800 IU therapy for adults aged 65 and over is likely to yield cost savings through reduction hip fracture alone in the first year...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Adults {{with low}} {{concentrations}} of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 [OH]D) in blood {{have an increased}} risk of falls and fractures, but randomised trials of vitamin D supplementation have had inconsistent results. We aimed to assess the effect of high-dose vitamin D supplementation on fractures and falls. METHODS: The Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) Study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of healthy volunteers aged 50 - 84 years conducted at one centre in Auckland, New Zealand. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either an initial oral dose of 200   000 IU (5 · 0 mg) <b>colecalciferol</b> (vitamin D 3) followed by monthly 100   000 IU (2 · 5 mg) <b>colecalciferol</b> or equivalent placebo dosing. The prespecified primary outcome was cardiovascular disease and secondary outcomes were respiratory illness and fractures. Here, we report secondary outcome data for fractures and post-hoc outcome data for falls. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for time to first fracture or time to first fall in individuals allocated vitamin D compared with placebo. The analysis of fractures included all participants who gave consent and was by intention-to-treat; the analysis of falls included all individuals who returned one or more questionnaires. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN 12611000402943. FINDINGS: Between April 5, 2011, and Nov 6, 2012, 5110 participants were recruited and randomly assigned either <b>colecalciferol</b> (n= 2558) or placebo (n= 2552).

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the health outcomes and economics {{associated with the}} current guidance relating to the prevention of falls in the elderly through vitamin D supplementation. Setting: UK. Participants: UK population aged 60  years and above. Interventions: A Markov health state transition model simulated patient transitions between key fall-related outcomes using a 5 -year horizon and annual cycles to assess {{the costs and benefits}} of empirical treatment with <b>colecalciferol</b> 800  iu daily. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Costs and health outcomes attributable to fall prevention following vitamin D supplementation. Results: Our model shows that treating the UK population aged 60  years and above with 800  iu <b>colecalciferol</b> would, over a 5 -year period: (1) prevent in excess of 430   000 minor falls; (2) avoid 190   000 major falls; (3) prevent 1579 acute deaths; (4) avoid 84   000 person-years of long-term care and (5) prevent 8300 deaths associated with increased mortality in long-term care. The greatest gains are seen among those 75  years and older. Based on reduction in falls alone, the intervention in all adults aged 65 + is cost-saving and leads to increased quality adjusted life years. Treating all adults aged 60 + incurs an intervention cost of £ 2. 70 bn over 5  years, yet produces a −£ 3. 12 bn reduction in fall-related costs; a net saving of £ 420 M. Increasing the lower bound age limit by 5 -year increments increases budget impact to −£ 1. 17 bn, −£ 1. 75 bn, and −£ 2. 06 bn for adults 65 +, 70 + and 75 +, respectively. Conclusions: This study shows that treatment of the elderly UK population with <b>colecalciferol</b> 800  iu daily would be associated with reductions in mortality and substantial cost-savings through fall prevention...|$|E

Serum 25 (OH) D concentrations were evaluated using LIAISON 25 -OH (Diasorin, Italy). Medsger disease severity scale (DSS), nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) and all instrumental exam contemplated by international guidelines were performed. Drug assumption, including oral <b>colecalciferol,</b> was evaluated. Non-parametric tests were used for statistical analysis. Average 25 (OH) D serum concentration was 18. 7 ± 9 ng/ml (< 20 classified as deficiency). A significant correlation was found with presence/absence of lung bi-basal fibrotic changes (16. 1 ± 8 ng/ml and 20 ± 10 ng/ml, respectively; p = 0. 04). Peripheral vascular (p = 0. 03), kidney (p = 0. 02), gastrointestinal (p = 0. 05) Medsger's DSS parameters were found to correlate with 25 (OH) D serum concentrations. No significant correlations were observed with digital ulcers incidence, strictly correlated to patterns of microangiopathy, defined at NVC analysis (p< 0. 0001). Interestingly, no effects of treatment with oral <b>colecalciferol</b> (Dibase 1, 000 IU daily for at least 6 months) were found on 25 (OH) D serum concentrations in treated (18. 8 ± 10 ng/ml) or untreated (18. 7 ± 9 ng/ml) SSc patients (p = 0. 81). A significant difference was observed among seasonal 25 (OH) D serum concentrations (winter: 14. 6 ± 7. 8 ng/ml, spring: 17. 2 ± 7. 9 ng/ml, summer: 21. 43 ± 10 ng/ml, autumn: 20. 2 ± 10 ng/ml; p = 0. 032) in all patients. Serum 25 (OH) D deficiency was found to correlate with lung involvement, peripheral vascular, kidney and gastrointestinal Medsger's DSS parameters and with seasonality In SSc patients. Supplementation with oral <b>colecalciferol</b> was found not effective in increasing 25 (OH) D serum concentrations.

40|$|The {{association}} of acanthosis nigricans, skin tags, diabetes mellitus due to insulin resistance, and obesity in {{adolescents and young}} adults represents a well defined syndrome. Hyperandrogenism may also be present. The endocrine origin of this condition is beyond doubt. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor- 1, and their receptors on keratinocytes are obviously involved in the complex regulations leading to the peculiar epidermal hyperplasia. This condition is unrelated to other types of acanthosis nigricans, including the congenital and the paraneoplastic types. Control of obesity contributes largely to reverse the whole process, essentially by reducing both insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia.

40|$|In the {{submitted}} {{work was}} examined {{to what extent}} the vitamin D status has an influence on the regulation of blood pressure or on reducing an increased blood pressure and whether there are differences between serial UV irradiation and oral substitution of <b>colecalciferol.</b> In a prospective, randomized, single-blind clinical study 64 participants with mild essential hypertension were irradiated either with a sun-similar (3. 5 % UV (B) -fraction) or nearly pure UV (A) -containing (99, 5 % UV (A) -fraction) UV-spectrum twice weekly for a total of 10 weeks. The UV (B) irradiated group additionally received placebo tablets, the UV (A) irradiated group tablets containing 10, 000 IU of <b>colecalciferol</b> twice weekly. Before the start, after 10 weeks of intervention and 5 weeks later without further intervention a 24 -hour blood pressure measurement was performed, also the blood levels of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3, calcitriol, parathyroid hormone and calcium were measured. In both groups there was a highly significant increase of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3, and a (temporary) suppression of parathyroid hormone while calcitriol and serum calcium remained constant. Since 10, 000 I. E. <b>colecalciferol</b> approximately equal one MEDII, the dosages were equivalent in both groups. Nevertheless, only in the UV(B) -group a decrease of blood pressure was shown {{at the end of the}} intervention period after ten weeks and five weeks after the end of the intervention, which was significant for diastolic blood pressure. For systolic blood pressure a trend in favor of the UV (B) -group was shown. Despite the evidence that several organs (such as vascular smooth muscle or the parathyroid) and cells (as in the juxtaglomerular apparatus (renin)) contain local vitamin d receptors, when considering blood pressure reduction UV exposure appears to have even more benefits. Physiologically, vitamin D activation occurs in the skin. The skin also expresses vitamin D receptors as well as the complete enzyme equipment and conversion capacity to produce calcitriol, the hormonally effective metabolite. Blood pressure regulation may already be affected in the resistance vessels in the subcutaneous layer. In addition, UV radiation may provide a vitamin D-independent vasorelaxing effect, for example, via the antioxidant system. This may support other vitamin D-mediated anti-hypertensive mechanisms such as reduction of the secretion of renin or PTH. Studies by other authors, who described a reduction in blood pressure by vitamin D substitution used active vitamin D preparations, such as calcitriol or 1 -alpha-hydroxylase. The conclusion of this investigation is that the vitamin D-mediated anti-hypertensive effects of UV (B) -exposure are superior to those of basal vitamin D substitution. A comparable effect only seems to occur when using active vitamin D derivatives. However, their application is limited by the (physiological) side effects such as risk of hypercalcaemia and calciuria...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin D {{deficiency}} is endemic worldwide. The Health Council of the Netherlands advises a <b>colecalciferol</b> {{intake of}} 800 IU/day and an intended serum level of calcidiol {{of at least}} 50 nmol/l for people aged 50 years and older and for osteoporosis patients. In 64 % of 626 fracture patients, we found a reduced serum calcidiol level according to this definition. According to calculations based on meta-analyses, a substantial proportion of fracture patients would not achieve the target calcidiol level of 50 nmol/l with a vitamin D supplement of 800 IU/day. For example, {{this would be the}} case in 37 % of elderly patients with osteoporosis. Until the results of a prospective study on this are published, we propose that fracture patients are either systematically given doses of vitamin D supplements higher than 800 IU/day, or that their serum calcidiol is measured and the dose of vitamin D supplements is adjusted according to this initial value and the desired serum concentrations, and that the measurement is repeated after 3 months so that the dosage can be adjusted if necessary...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: People with {{intellectual}} disabilities have a {{high risk}} of osteoporosis and fractures, which could partly be as a result of vitamin D deficiency. AIMS: To compare the serum vitamin D (25 (OH) D) levels of 155 patients with intellectual disabilities under psychiatric care and 192 controls, investigate potential risk factors for vitamin D deficiency in people with intellectual disabilities and assess available treatments. METHOD: Cross-sectional observational study followed by treatment evaluation. Results Almost twice as many patients with intellectual disabilities had vitamin D deficiency (25 (OH) D < 50 nmol/l) compared with controls (77. 3 % v. 39. 6 %, P< 0. 0001). In the intellectual disabilities group, winter season (P< 0. 0001), dark skin pigmentation (P< 0. 0001), impaired mobility (P = 0. 002) and obesity (P = 0. 001) were independently associated with lower serum 25 (OH) D. In most patients, 800 IU <b>colecalciferol</b> daily normalised 25 (OH) D levels. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in people with intellectual disabilities, partly because of insufficient exposure to sunlight. Screening and treatment strategies, aiming to reduce these patients' high fracture risk, should be introduced. Similar strategies may be required in other psychiatric populations at risk for fractures and with a tendency to spend excessive time indoors...|$|E

This is a case report is about a thalassaemic young female with multiple spine fractures (D 11, D 12 e L 2) and lumbar spine DEXA - Tscore = - 3, 1 and femoral = - 3, 4. This was in spite of therapy with alendronate 70 mg/week from January 2006 to September 2007. The patient was subsequentently treated for 18 months with 1 - 34 recombinant human parathyroid hormone and <b>colecalciferol</b> (100. 000 U/monthly). After 4 months of therapy, the patient showed a decrease in spinal pain (Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire) and an improvement of quality of life (Qualeffo) with normalization of osteocalcin and 25 -OHcolecalciferol haematic levels after 6 months. Lumbar spine and femoral DEXA - Tscore, at 18 months, rose respectively to - 2, 5 and - 2, 4. Thalassaemia-induced osteoporosis is multifactorial and its management is very difficult.

40|$|The {{available}} {{literature on}} cost benefit, cost effectiveness and cost utility of different drug and non-drug regimens in preventing hip fractures was reviewed. The {{cost of a}} hip fracture and of the different treatment regimens varied considerably {{from one country to}} another. In primary prevention, potential savings only exceeded costs in women over the age of 70 years treated with hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). In the case of HRT, treating those with low bone mineral density levels (secondary prevention) seems to be more cost effective than general treatment (primary prevention). There are few studies that have compared several different preventive regimens. Cost effectiveness {{is directly related to the}} cost of the regimen used because there is no significant difference in their effectiveness. That is, a high cost regimen such as bisphosphonates would be less cost effective than a low cost regimen such as HRT, judged from existing literature. High risk groups can be identified (nursing home residents) and treated with low cost interventions (calcium plus vitamin D or hip protectors). Considerable differences in the estimates used for the efficacy of different regimens in studies exist.

40|$|Background and objective: Osteoporosis is a {{major health}} threat nowadays. Aging of the {{population}} and changes in peoples’ lifestyle result in a constant {{increase in the number of}} fractures all over the world. Our study aimed at describing the drug utilization pattern and choice of active substances of antiosteoporotic medicines in the Baltic countries. Materials and methods: Sales data of the antiosteoporotic medicines was obtained from the internet. These are available on the website of medicines regulatory agencies. The World Health Organization (WHO) methodology of Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification and defined daily dose (DDD) was used to compare the data among countries. Results: During the study period the consumption of antiosteoporotic medicines was rather stable in all the countries. The overall choice of active substances used to treat osteoporosis is similar in all the Baltic countries but the market shares of substances were different. Estonia stands out with high use of combination product of alendronic acid and <b>colecalciferol.</b> In Latvia the highest consumption was of risedronic acid. In Lithuania the most used active substance in 2014 was ibandronic acid and second was denosumab with 0. 8 daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day (DID) and 25 % of the total share. Conclusions: The differences in consumption of drugs against osteoporosis in the Baltic countries are not very big. The consumption of antiosteoporotic drugs is not to be regarded as sufficient though. The generally low consumption of osteoporotic medicines in the Baltic countries can be attributed to the overall less than EU average wealth of the countries and less than optimal expenditure on healthcare out of the GDP...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{most common}} cause of {{hypoparathyroidism}} is iatrogenic in the context of surgical procedures to the neck and commonly the thyroid gland. Hypoparathyroidism is characterized by hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphatemia and low or inappropriately normal levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and may be associated with multiorgan complications and variable clinical presentation. Seizures may be the only presenting symptom and may result in antiepileptic therapy. Knowledge of all possible consequences of hypoparathyroidism is essential for correct patient management. Case Description: A 76 -year-old woman was admitted due to loss of consciousness, seizures and hypocalcemia. She had had total thyroidectomy over 60 years ago for toxic goiter, complicated by permanent hypoparathyroidism. Her calcium levels were erratic, treated with calcium, <b>colecalciferol</b> and calcitriol. She developed progressive confusion, and had convulsive episode before hospitalization. Clinical investigation revealed widespread cerebral calcifications, EEG abnormalities and diffuse skeletal abnormalities. Later, during hip replacement surgery, bone histopathology showed bone marrow substitution by fibrous tissue undergoing ossification. All clinical problems occurring to the patient can be referred to hypoparathyroidism and consequent hypocalcemia not adequately corrected, including early bilateral cataracts. In the absence of consolidated hormone replacement therapy, treatment of hypoparathyroidism is represented by vitamin D and calcium supplementation. In our case, the total absence of PTH and its role on vitamin D activation did not allow optimal control of serum calcium, despite normal levels of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D being observed. The achievement of target values in serum calcium was obtained only with calcitriol. Treatment with levetiracetam was thus suspended and no more seizures occurred at two year follow-up. Conclusion: Awareness that convulsions can only be caused by hypocalcemia, even in the presence of organic brain injuries, can help patients avoid using unnecessary medications and their potentially harmful side effects...|$|E

O nível basal de <b>colecalciferol</b> foi de 2. 756 UI/kg, correspondendo a 5, 51 g do produto comercial Hy. D®/t de ração, como fonte de 25 (OH) D 3. Os fatores estudados não influenciaram o consumo de ração, a produção, o peso e a massa de ovos. Observou-se efeito da interação de fontes de vitamina sobre a conversão alimentar, que foi melhor quando utilizado metabólito 25 (OH) D 3 na ausência de vitamina C. Interações foram observadas para porcentagem de albúmen e porcentagem de gema, que aumentaram na presença de 200 ppm de vitamina C. O peso específico dos ovos, as concentrações de cálcio sérico, cinzas ósseas e a resistência à quebra não foram influenciadas pelas fontes de vitamina D e C. Houve interação para porcentagem e espessura de casca, cujos maiores valores foram obtidos com a suplementação de vitamina C na presença de 25 (OH) D 3. Em poedeiras na fase inicial de produção, a conversão alimentar é melhor com a utilização do 25 (OH) D 3 e a espessura e porcentagem de casca também melhoram com a utilização de 25 (OH) D 3 e a suplementação de vitamina C nas dietas (100 ou 200 ppm, respectivamente). An {{experiment was}} conducted to evaluate the influence of two vitamin D sources and three vitamin C levels on performance, internal and external egg quality, and bone strength characteristics. In addition, the total and ionic blood calcium concentrations, bone ash and calcium were determined. Two hundred and eighty eight 23 -week-old ISA Babcock B- 300 ® laying hens were used during the 12 -week study in a 2 &# 215; 3 factorial arrangement: vitamin D sources (cholecalciferol and 25 -hydroxycholecalciferol - 25 (OH) D 3) and vitamin C levels (0, 100 and 200 ppm) resulting in six treatments with eight replicates of six hens each. The basal cholecalciferol level was 2, 756 IU/kg, corresponding to 5. 51 g Hy. D®/t, as source of 25 (OH) D 3. Feed intake, egg production, egg weight and egg mass were not influenced by the treatments. An interaction was observed for feed conversion, which was improved when 25 (OH) D 3 was added without vitamin C. Haugh unit and yolk index were not influenced, however, interactions were observed for albumen percent and yolk percent, which were improved when 200 ppm of vitamin C was supplemented. Egg specific gravity, serum calcium, bone ash and bone strength resistance were not influenced by the treatments. There was an interaction for shell percent and shell thickness, which were improved when vitamin C was added in association with 25 (OH) D 3. It was concluded, for laying hens at initial phase of egg production, that feed conversion is improved when 25 (OH) D 3 was the vitamin D source, and that shell thickness and shell percent are improved when the vitamin D source was 25 (OH) D 3 with diets supplemented with vitamin C (100 or 200 ppm, respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|Antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) and {{medicinal}} herbs {{as well as}} vitamin D are metabolized by the cytochrome P 450 enzyme system in the liver. This thesis focuses on the interaction between these compounds. We also explored the hypothesis that HIV-patients might develop insufficiënt vitamin D levels {{as a result of}} CYP 450 interactions. Many HIV infected patients use herbal medicines. Usage of herbal medicines concomitant to ARVs might lead to toxic or subtherapeutic drug concentrations. We provided an overview of the potential herb-ARV interactions of Western and African herbal medicines. St John's wort, garlic, Echinacea, ginkgo and milk thistle might cause significant interactions. More research on interaction risks of Western and especially African herbal medicines is urgently required. Therefore, the interaction potential and toxicity of twelve potent antifungal active Tanzanian herbal medicines was investigated. All herbs showed high cytotoxic effects and potent competition with CYP enzymes was found for 75 %. Also in Europe the intake of herbs and dietary supplements is common. We described a case of a Dutch HIV patient taking herbal medicines concomitant to lopinavir, which resulted in a toxic lopinavir level. This illustrates that physicians should be aware of herb-ARV interactions. Beside herbs many HIV patients use vitamin D supplements. Insufficient vitamin D levels might be the result of dark skin color, insufficient intake or HIV itself. We found a prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among HIV- 1 patients in the Netherlands (n= 252) of 29 %. Beside skin color, also specific antiretroviral agents (NNRTIs) may add more risk for low vitamin D levels.

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the effectiveness of daily supplementation with 800 IU of D 2 (drops) and D 3 (pills) on 25 -hydroxivitamin D (25 OHD) levels (= 30 ng/ml). Twenty-one ambulatory postmenopausal women from Buenos Aires City with a mean (± SD) age of 77. 1 ± 6. 8 years were included. The participants were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: GD 2 (n = 13) : 800 IU (drops) and GD 3 (n = 8) : 800 IU (pills). Serum 25 OHD levels were measured (RIA-DIASORIN) at baseline, and at 7, 28 and 45 days. Nineteen out of twenty one women showed deficient levels of 25 OHD at baseline (< 20 ng/ml) : GD 2 : 14. 0 ± 4. 8 ng/ml and GD 3 : 13. 2 ± 4. 9 ng/ml (NS). Whereas only GD 3 exhibited an increase (~ 25 %) at 7 days, both groups showed a significant increase at the end of the study. However, neither attained adequate 25 OHD levels (GD 2 : 17. 4 ± 5. 5 vs. GD 3 : 22. 9 ± 4. 6 ng/ml; p < 0. 001). Administration of 800 IU of vitamin D 3 during 45 days was more effective than D 2 in increasing 25 OHD, but both failed to achieve adequate levels of 25 OHD (= 30 ng/ml). but neither succeeded in achieving adequate levels of 25 OHD (= 30 ng/ml) ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients {{with chronic}} obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) often have vitamin D deficiency, which {{is associated with}} increased susceptibility to upper respiratory infection-a major precipitant of exacerbation. Multicentre trials of vitamin D supplementation for prevention of exacerbation and upper respiratory infection in patients with COPD are lacking. We therefore investigated whether vitamin D 3 (<b>colecalciferol)</b> supplementation would reduce the incidence of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations and upper respiratory infections. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D 3 supplementation in adults with COPD in 60 general practices and four Acute National Health Service Trust clinics in London, UK. Patients were allocated to receive six 2 -monthly oral doses of 3 mg vitamin D 3 or placebo over 1 year in a 1 : 1 ratio using computer-generated permuted block randomisation. Participants and study staff were masked to treatment assignment. Coprimary outcomes were time to first moderate or severe exacerbation and first upper respiratory infection. Analysis was by intention to treat. A prespecified subgroup analysis was done to assess whether effects of the intervention on the coprimary outcomes were modified by baseline vitamin D status. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00977873. FINDINGS: 240 patients were randomly allocated to the vitamin D 3 group (n= 122) and placebo group (n= 118). Vitamin D 3 compared with placebo did not affect time to first moderate or severe exacerbation (adjusted hazard ratio 0 Â· 86, 95 % CI 0 Â· 60 - 1 Â· 24, p= 0 Â· 42) or time to first upper respiratory infection (0 Â· 95, 0 Â· 69 - 1 Â· 31, p= 0 Â· 75). Prespecified subgroup analysis showed that vitamin D 3 was protective against moderate or severe exacerbation in participants with baseline serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of less than 50 nmol/L (0 Â· 57, 0 Â· 35 - 0 Â· 92, p= 0 Â· 021), but not in those with baseline 25 -hydroxyvitamin D levels of at least 50 nmol/L (1 Â· 45, 0 Â· 81 - 2 Â· 62, p= 0 Â· 21; p= 0 Â· 021 for interaction between allocation and baseline serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D status). Baseline vitamin D status did not modify the effect of the intervention on risk of upper respiratory infection (pinteraction= 0 Â· 41). INTERPRETATION: Vitamin D 3 supplementation protected against moderate or severe exacerbation, but not upper respiratory infection, in patients with COPD with baseline 25 -hydroxyvitamin D levels of less than 50 nmol/L. Our findings suggest that correction of vitamin D deficiency in patients with COPD reduces the risk of moderate or severe exacerbation. FUNDING: UK National Institute for Health Research...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} {{with the objective of}} evaluating the addition of 25 -hydroxycholecalciferol (25 (OH) D 3) in diets of broiler breeder hens. The experiment used Cobb 500 broiler breeder hens and was allotted to a complete randomized design with four treatments and eight replications of twenty females and two males each. The treatments consisted of vitamin premixes with 2, 000 and 3, 400 IU/kg diet vitamin D 3 as the only source of vitamin or 2, 000 IU D 3 plus 35 or 69 mg/t of 25 (OH) D 3. Results of this experiment indicated that 25 (OH) D 3 had no significant effect on egg production parameters from 32 to 67 weeks. The supplementation of 25 (OH) D 3 resulted in better quality egg shells evaluated by the specific gravity at 60 weeks of age, regardless of the dosage. No significant differences were observed for hatchability of broiler breeder fertile eggs at 54 and 64 weeks. At 64 weeks, the hatch residue breakout showed less embryo mortality at the third week for treatments receiving 2, 000 UI D 3 in the diet and less embryo mortality at the second week of development from hens aged 67 weeks and supplemented with 2, 000 IU D 3 and 2, 000 IU D 3 + 69 mg 25 (OH) D 3. It was concluded that the supplementation with 25 -hydroxycholecalciferol with cholecalciferol had similar effects as the diets with vitamin D 3 as the only source on the productive performance of broiler breeder hens. Foi realizado um experimento com o objetivo de avaliar a suplementação de 25 -hidroxicolecalciferol (25 (OH) D 3) associado à vitamina D 3 em dietas para reprodutoras de frangos de corte. Foram alojadas matrizes Cobb 500 em delineamento completamente casualizado, composto de quatro tratamentos e oito repetições de 20 fêmeas e 2 machos. Os tratamentos experimentais foram constituídos de premixes vitamínicos contendo 2. 000 e 3. 400 UI/kg ração de vitamina D 3 como única fonte ou 2. 000 UI D 3 associado a 35 ou 69 mg/t de 25 (OH) D 3. Não houve efeito da suplementação de 25 (OH) D 3 sobre a produção de ovos durante o período de 32 a 67 semanas. A qualidade da casca dos ovos, mensurada por meio da gravidade específica, melhorou com a suplementação de 25 (OH) D 3 em reprodutoras com 60 semanas de idade, independentemente da dose. Não foi observada diferença significativa na taxa de eclosão de ovos férteis incubados nas 54 e 64 semanas de idade das aves. Às 64 semanas, houve menor mortalidade de embriões na terceira semana entre as aves recebendo a dieta com 2. 000 UI D 3, enquanto, às 67 semanas, houve menor mortalidade na primeira semana de embriões provenientes de reprodutoras sob suplementação com 2. 000 UI D 3 e 2. 000 UI D 3 + 69 mg 25 (OH) D 3. A combinação de 25 -hidroxicolecalciferol e <b>colecalciferol</b> teve efeito similar ao das dietas com vitamina D 3 como fonte exclusiva sobre o desempenho produtivo de reprodutoras pesadas...|$|E

40|$|Esta revisão tem como objetivo {{principal}} mostrar, baseado em dezenas de pesquisas realizadas, os efeitos tóxicos das micotoxinas aflatoxinas, tricotecenos, zealenona e fumonisinas sobre o desempenho das aves. O descobrimento das propriedades hepatotóxicas e hepatocarcinogênicas de algumas linhagens de Aspergillus flavus e A. parasiticus em perus, na Inglaterra, no início da década de 1960, seguida pela elucidação da estrutura de seus metabólitos tóxicos, as aflatoxinas, deu novo enfoque e prioridade para a pesquisa sobre micotoxinas. Análises de aflatoxinas realizadas no Laboratório de Análises Micotoxicológicas (LAMIC) da Universidade Fedaral de Santa Maria, entre os anos de 1986 e janeiro de 2000, em 15. 600 amostras de alimentos destinados principalmente ao consumo animal, demonstram que no milho analisado, 41, 9 % das amostras estavam contaminadas por aflatoxinas. Em surtos de aflatoxicose no campo, uma das características mais marcantes é a má absorção que se manifesta como partículas de ração mal digeridas na excreta das aves. Também observa-se, em frangos e poedeiras que recebem AFL, extrema palidez das mucosas e pernas. Dietas deficientes em riboflavina ou <b>colecalciferol</b> (vit. D) tornaram frangos sensíveis, nos índices de desenvolvimento corporal, a concentrações muito baixas de AFL. O efeito aflatoxina nos frangos é maior na fase inicial de crescimento, ou seja, quando as aves ingeriram aflatoxina nos primeiros 21 dias de vida, e quanto maior o nível de stress do lote, menor a quantidade de AFL para afetar negativamente seu desempenho, seja na produção de carne ou de ovos. As principais micotoxinas do grupo dos tricotecenos são: toxina T- 2; deoxynivalenol (DON); diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS), todas produzidas através de diversas espécies de fungos do gênero Fusarium. Além dos tricotecenos, o fusarium também pode produzir zearalenona e fumonisinas. Dessas fusarium-toxinas, somente toxina T- 2 gera patologias sérias nas aves, como lesões orais e imunodepressão. As fumonisinas afetam o desempenho de frangos de corte a partir de uma ingestão de 75 ppm. Já zearalenona e DON são inócuas quando ingeridas por aves. Para o controle de contaminação de micotoxinas nos alimentos, o melhor método é prevenir o crescimento de fungos, apertando-se no controle de qualidade da matéria prima. Métodos alternativos podem ser usados, utilizando-se antifúngicos ou adsorventes na ração. O monitoramento dos grãos recebidos ou a receber é o ponto fundamental num programa de controle de micotoxinas. Isso deve ser feito através de um programa amostral consistente da massa de grãos recebida ou a ser adquirida, com análises periódicas das micotoxinas. This {{article is}} aimed at briefly reviewing the toxic effects of mycotoxins aflatoxins, trichothecenes, zearalenone and fumonisins in the growth performance of poultry. The discovery of hepatotoxic and carcinogenic properties of some lineages of Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus for turkey in England in the 60 ’s, followed by {{the determination of the}} chemical structure of their toxic components - the aflatoxins (AFL) - brought a new focus and {{paved the way for the}} modern mycotoxicologic research. From 1986 to January of 2000, 15, 600 food samples, mostly for animal consumption, were submitted to aflatoxin analysis at the Laboratory for Mycotoxicologic Analysis (LAMIC-UFSM, Brazil). Among the corn samples tested, 41. 9 % were positive for aflatoxins. In field outbreaks o aflatoxicosis, the most prominent feature is the low absorption of nutrients, leading to the appearance of particles of feed in the feaces. Paleness of the legs and mucosas is also often observed in broilers and laying hens. Diets deficient in riboflavin and colecarciferol (vitamin D) may significantly increase the susceptibility of broilers to AFLs, resulting in a poor growth performance. The adverse effects of AFLs are more intense during the initial periods of growth, i. e. when the animals are fed AFL-contaminated food during the first 21 days of life. The level of stress has also been shown to enhance the toxic effects of AFLs, by reducing the toxic threshold and leading to a reduction in growth and egg production. The main mycotoxins belonging to the trichothecenes group are toxin T- 2, deoxynivalenol (DON) and diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS), produced by several fungi species of the genera Fusarium. Fungi belonging to the Fusarium genus also produce zearalenona and fumonisin. Among the Fusarium mycotoxins, only toxin T- 2 is a severe pathogen for poultry, causing oral lesions and immunodepression. The fumonisins can affect the growth performance of broilers at doses as low as 75 ppm. In contrast, no toxic effects of zearalenona and DON have been demonstrated for poultry. The method of choice to prevent food contamination with mycotoxins is to avoid fungal growth, narrowing the quality control of the grains in the farm or during storage/transportation. Alternative methods such as antifungic drugs or adsorbents may also be used with success. Monitoring grains before or as they enter the food industry is the key point in a mycotoxin control program. This can be accomplished through a systematic and consistent mycotoxicologic analysis of grain samples already received at the plant or to be purchased...|$|E
