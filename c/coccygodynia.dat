5000|$|Two {{more highly}} common causes of {{functional}} anorectal pain are levator ani syndrome (LAS) and proctalgia fugax. Both {{of these conditions}} {{are thought to be}} caused by muscle spasms of the either the levator ani muscle or the anal sphincter muscle respectively, and may overlap symptomatically with a third less-common condition called <b>coccygodynia</b> which is the result of previous trauma to the coccyx bone. Stress, prolonged sitting, and constipation all seem to be associated with LAS. The majority (90%) of those reporting chronic episodes of such pain are women. Some researchers group these conditions under the medical category of [...] "tension myalgia of the pelvic floor". Less than a third of those experiencing these conditions seek medical treatment for them. Treatment can involve the use of antispasmotic medications as well as the down-training (conscious involvement and relaxation of previously unconscious muscle movements) so that spasms occur less frequently or not at all.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{report the}} middle term results of partial {{coccygectomy}} in a consecutive series of 15 {{patients with chronic}} <b>coccygodynia.</b> METHODS: Fifteen patients with chronic <b>coccygodynia</b> were referred to our outpatient clinics. The patients were investigated with dynamic lateral radiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We diagnosed a posttraumatic <b>coccygodynia</b> with instability of the coccygeal segment and performed a partial coccygectomy after failure of the conservative treatment. RESULTS: All patients underwent subjective and objective assessment after a mean time of 2. 8 years from surgery. There were 11 excellent, 3 good, and 1 fair results. The mean time of improvement was 15 weeks, and no further improvement was observed after 6 months. CONCLUSION: Partial coccygectomy is a good therapeutic option for posttraumatic <b>coccygodynia.</b> Dynamic radiography is a useful tool to differentiate posttraumatic from idiopathic <b>coccygodynia.</b> MRI may be useful for further evaluation of the patients after inconclusive dynamic radiography...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the fluoroscopic guided injection, local injection, conservative treatment and surgery in managing <b>coccygodynia.</b> Methods: Fifty chronic <b>coccygodynia</b> patients were evaluated. All patients complained of pain while sitting and had tenderness localized to the coccyx. All patients were offered conservative management initially, {{then they were}} assigned into four groups: 5 patients underwent coccygectomy, 22 patients had fluoroscopic guided injection, 11 patients had local injection, and 12 patients were treated only conservatively. Patients’ satisfaction with treatment was assessed by a visual analog scale (VAS). The follow-up period ranged from 7 to 32  months (mean 17. 3  months). Results: The initial conservative therapy had the lowest improvement rate (7 / 50, 14 %). All patients subjected to coccygectomy or fluoroscopic guided injections improved and were satisfied. Nine patients of the local injection group (9 / 11, 82 %) improved and 2 patients (18 %) were stationary. Fourteen of the 16 patients with hypermobility (88 %) required fluoroscopic guided injection, while 60 % (12 / 20) of patients with normal mobility were treated conservatively. All patients with spicule required surgery. Conclusions: Fluoroscopic guided injection and surgery have the highest efficacy and satisfaction rates in managing chronic <b>coccygodynia.</b> Hypermobility and spicules are predictors of failure of conservative therapy...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Glomus coccygeum is a glomus body {{which is}} found in the pericoccygeal soft tissue. This {{specialised}} arteriovenous anastomosis is a non-pathological vestigial structure usually larger than its equivalent in the distal extremities. Its prevalence is uncertain. Glomus coccygeum has been associated with <b>coccygodynia</b> and can cause diagnostic problems to pathologists unfamiliar with this entity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The presence of a glomus coccygeum was sought in 40 coccygectomy specimens and correlated with clinical, radiological and histological findings. RESULTS: A glomus coccygeum was identified in 13 samples (35 %). Glomus cells expressed smooth muscle actin (SMA) and were negative for desmin, S 100, cytokeratin and a wide range of vascular markers. Proliferative activity was low. Pre-operative MRI did not identify these tiny lesions, and most patients with <b>coccygodynia</b> did not have a glomus coccygeum. CONCLUSION: Glomus coccygeum is a common microanatomical structure which can be distinguished from glomus and other tumours by its small size, SMA expression and low proliferative activity...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{present the}} results of {{dextrose}} prolotherapy undertaken for chronic non-responding <b>coccygodynia</b> in 37 patients. Methods. 14 men and 23 women (mean age, 36 years) with chronic <b>coccygodynia</b> not responding to conservative treatment for more than 6 months were included. 27 of them had received local steroid injections.

Literature retrieval was performed by the use of the PubMed searching engine utilising the terms ‘coccygodynia–coccygectomy’ in the English language from January 1980 to January 2010. Case reports and tumour related case series were excluded as well as articles published in other languages. In total 24 manuscripts were analyzed. Only 2 of them were prospective studies whereas 22 were retrospective case series; five were classified as Level III studies and the remaining as Level IV studies. In total, 671 patients with <b>coccygodynia</b> underwent coccygectomy following failed conservative management. The sex ratio, male/female was 1 : 4. 4. The most popular aetiology for <b>coccygodynia</b> was direct trauma in 270 patients. 504 of the patients reported an excellent/good outcome following the procedure. There were 9 deep and 47 superficial infections. Other complications included two haematomas, six delayed wound healings and nine wound dehiscence. The overall complication rate was 11 %.

40|$|Abstract Background There are {{no reports}} {{describing}} complications with posterior spinal fusion (PSF) with segmental spinal instrumentation (SSI) using pedicle screw fixation {{in patients with}} neuromuscular scoliosis. Methods Fifty neuromuscular patients (18 cerebral palsy, 18 Duchenne muscular dystrophy, 8 spinal muscular atrophy and 6 others) were divided in two groups according to severity of curves; group I (90 °). All underwent PSF and SSI with pedicle screw fixation. There were no anterior procedures. Perioperative (within three months of surgery) and postoperative (after three months of surgery) complications were retrospectively reviewed. Results There were fifty (37 perioperative, 13 postoperative) complications. Hemo/pneumothorax, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema requiring ICU care, complete spinal cord injury, deep wound infection and death were major complications; while atelectesis, pneumonia, mild pleural effusion, UTI, ileus, vomiting, gastritis, tingling sensation or radiating pain in lower limb, superficial infection and wound dehiscence were minor complications. Regarding perioperative complications, 34 (68 %) patients {{had at least one}} major or one minor complication. There were 16 patients with pulmonary, 14 with abdominal, 3 with wound related, 2 with neurological and 1 cardiovascular complications, respectively. There were two deaths, one due to cardiac arrest and other due to hypovolemic shock. Regarding postoperative complications 7 patients had <b>coccygodynia,</b> 3 had screw head prominence, 2 had bed sore and 1 had implant loosening, respectively. There was a significant relationship between age and increased intraoperative blood loss (p = 0. 024). However it did not increased complications or need for ICU care. Similarly intraoperative blood loss > 3500 ml, severity of curve or need of pelvic fixation did not increase the complication rate or need for ICU. DMD patients had higher chances of <b>coccygodynia</b> postoperatively. Conclusion Although posterior-only approach using pedicle screw fixation had good correction rate, complications were similar to previous reports.

30|$|A painful coccyx is {{a common}} {{complaint}} in women due to the posterior prominence of the coccyx anatomically in the female pelvis, meaning that it is exposed to multiple traumas. However, physicians should also consider atypical conditions such as tuberculosis in patients presenting with <b>coccygodynia,</b> especially those who are refractory to treatment with conservative measures, and in association with HIV. Most sacral and sacrococcygeal lesions heal with adequate local support and antitubercular therapy, but coccygectomy may be essential in refractory cases.|$|E
40|$|Objective: A {{review of}} the {{literature}} on coccygectomy and our patients was performed to assess the effectiveness of coccy-gectomy for chronic refractory <b>coccygodynia.</b> Methods: An English language PubMed search was conducted with the terms ‘‘coccygodynia’ ’ and ‘ ‘ coccygectomy’ ’ from January 1980 to January 2012. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and performed telephone questionnaire on 61 patients who underwent coccygectomy at UCDMC between 1997 and 2009. Results: There were 28 case series from 1980 to 2012 for a total of 742 patients who underwent coccygectomy following failed conservative management. The mean age ranged from 26. 4 to 52. 8 years. The most common cause was direct trauma (58. 5 %) with a male:female ratio of 1 : 5. 2. Most patients (84 %) had a good to excellent outcome after coccygectomy. The most common complication is wound infection (10. 0 %). The overall complication rate was 13. 3 %. Similarly, 84. 6 % of patients from our own surgical case series reported good to excellent outcomes with 11. 5 % wound infection. Conclusion: Coccygectomy is an effective treatment for chronic refractory <b>coccygodynia.</b> The surgery isrelatively simple to perform but precaution must be taken to avoid wound infection...|$|E

Massive lesions of the sacral nerve roots (plexopathy) {{are characterized}} by a loss of strength in hip extension, knee flexion, and dorsal plantar flexion of the foot. Because the vesical parasympathetic neurons (pelvic splanchnic nerves) are contained in sacral nerve roots S 3 - 5, vesical symptoms are virtually constant. In extrinsic nerve irritation, bladder hypersensitivity is quasi systematic; true bladder overactivity may even be observed. Axonal nerve damage is characterized by loss of sensitivity or even numbness in the corresponding dermatomes, and ultrasound usually reveals postvoid residual urine; urodynamic testing confirms detrusor hypotonia or atonia as well as bladder hyposensitivity and increased bladder capacity.|$|E

40|$|This {{systematic}} review addresses the pathophysiology, diagnostic evaluation, {{and treatment of}} several chronic pain syndromes affecting the pelvic organs: chronic proctalgia, <b>coccygodynia,</b> pudendal neuralgia, and chronic pelvic pain. Chronic or recurrent pain in the anal canal, rectum, or other pelvic organs occurs in 7 % to 24 % {{of the population and}} is associated with impaired quality of life and high health care costs. However, these pain syndromes are poorly understood, with little research evidence available to guide their diagnosis and treatment. This situation appears to be changing: A recently published large randomized, controlled trial by our group comparing biofeedback, electrogalvanic stimulation, and massage for the treatment of chronic proctalgia has shown success rates of 85 % for biofeedback when patients are selected based on physical examination evidence of tenderness in response to traction on the levator ani muscle-a physical sign suggestive of striated muscle tension. Excessive tension (spasm) in the striated muscles of the pelvic floor appears to be common to most of the pelvic pain syndromes. This suggests the possibility that similar approaches to diagnostic assessment and treatment may improve outcomes in other pelvic pain disorders...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{sciatic nerve}} {{is the large}} stand {{thickest}} branch of lumbosacral plexus. It has a long course in the pelvic cavity and in the lower extremity. It separates into its two branches, the tibial and common peroneal nerves outside the pelvis. But the division can occur at any level from the sacral plexus to the inferior part of the popliteal fossa. These anatomical variations in division may cause nerve compression resulting in sciatica, piriformis syndrome, and <b>coccygodynia.</b> Aim: The {{aim of this study}} is to observe the variations in division of sciatic nerve as compared to known facts. Methods: The study was performed on cadavers. The inferior extremities of 45 cadavers were examined and variations of division of sciatic nerve were noted and classified. Results: The highest incidence of sciatic nerve variation was observed in its termination. In 11. 11 % of cases the sciatic nerve was found to be divided in the gluteal region. In 11. 11 %specimens, the common peroneal nerve pierced the piriformis muscle. Conclusion: The higher division of sciatic nerve can result in the involvement of only one out of the two divisions for the sciatic neuropathy. It is important to consider the higher divisions while performing opliteal block anaesthesia...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Sciatic nerve {{variations}} {{are relatively}} common. These variations are often very significant in several fields of Medicine. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to present two such variants and discuss their clinical implications. Material and Methods: Three Caucasian cadavers with no prior history of lower limb trauma or surgery were dissected and found to present anatomical variants of the sciatic nerve. Results: In all cases the sciatic nerve divided above the popliteal fossa. In two cases (cadavers 1 and 2) it divided on both sides in the inferior portion of the gluteal region in its two terminal branches: the common fibular and the tibial nerves. In another case (cadaver 3) the sciatic nerve was found to divide inside the pelvis just before coursing the greater sciatic notch. The common fibular nerve exited the pelvis above the pyriformis muscle and then passed along its posterior aspect, while the tibial nerve coursed deep to the pyriformis muscle. Discussion: According to the literature, the anatomical variant described in cadaver 3 is considered relatively rare. This variant can predispose to nerve entrapment and thus to the pyriformis syndrome, sciatica and <b>coccygodynia.</b> The high division of the sciatic nerve, as presented in cadavers 1 and 2, can make popliteal nerve blocks partially ineffective. Conclusion: The anatomical variants associated with a high division of the sciatic nerve, must always be born in mind, as they are relatively prevalent, and have important clinical implications, namely in Anesthesiology, Neurology, Sports Medicine and Surgery...|$|E
40|$|Literature has {{described}} treatment of flaccid neuromuscular scoliosis using different instrumentation; however, only one {{article has been}} published using posterior-only pedicle screw fixation. Complications using pedicle screws in paralytic neuromuscular scoliosis has not been described before. To present results and complications with posterior-only pedicle screws, a retrospective study {{was carried out in}} 27 consecutive patients with flaccid neuromuscular scoliosis (Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy), who were operated between 2002 and 2006 using posterior-only pedicle screw instrumentation. Immediate postoperative and final follow-up results were compared using t test for Cobb angle, pelvic obliquity, thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis. Perioperative and postoperative complications were noted from the hospital records of each patient. Complications, not described in literature, were discussed in detail. Average follow-up was 32. 2  months. Preoperative, immediate postoperative and final follow-up Cobb angle were 79. 8 °, 30. 2 ° (63. 3 % correction, p <  0. 0001) and 31. 9 °, respectively; and pelvic obliquity was 18. 3 °, 8. 9 ° (52 % correction, p <  0. 0001) and 8. 9 °. Postoperative thoracic kyphosis remained unchanged from 27. 6 ° to 19. 9 ° (p =  0. 376); while lumbar lordosis improved significantly from + 15. 6 ° to − 22. 4 ° lordosis (p =  0. 0002). Most patients had major to moderate improvement in postoperative functional and ambulatory status compared to the preoperative status. Thirteen (48. 1 %) perioperative complications were noted with five major complications (four respiratory in the form of hemothorax or respiratory failure that required ventilator support and one death) and eight minor complications (three UTI, two atelectasis, two neurological and one ileus). Postoperatively, we noted complications, such as <b>coccygodynia</b> with subluxation in 7, back sore on the convex side in 4 and dislodging of rod distally in 1 patient making a total of 12 (44. 4 %) postoperative complications. Of 12 postoperative complications, 6 (50 %) required secondary procedure.
