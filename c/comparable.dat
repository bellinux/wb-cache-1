Its major application limits are all in situations in which {{the real estate market}} doesn’t offer a sufficient number of <b>comparables</b> to implement statistical tools. In low-transaction real estate markets, the most effective appraisal method is the market comparison approach (MCA). The application limits of MCA depend on the degree of similarity between the properties’ characteristics and the reliability of the prices of <b>comparables.</b> In this paper, we introduce some rational measurements in order to guarantee a scientific approach to MCA is associated with the correct prices. Our method is able to restore appraisals of the market value of any type of property, even in situations in which the <b>comparables</b> are limited or when the reliability of the buying and selling prices could be better...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We refine {{existing}} general network optimization techniques, {{give new}} characterizations {{for the class}} of problems to which they can be applied, and show that {{they can also be}} used to solve various twoplayer games in almost linear time. Among these is a new variant of the network interdiction problem, where the interdictor wants to destroy high-capacity paths from the source to the destination using a vertexwise limited budget of arc removals. We also show that replacing the limit average in mean payoff games by the maximum weight results in a class of games amenable to these techniques. 1 Min-Max Problems We consider problems whose instances have two parts: a finite discrete part (e. g., a graph), the structure, and a list of n objects from some totally ordered set K (e. g., real numbers), the <b>comparables.</b> We adopt the standard random access machine model augmented with the capability of comparing any two of the given <b>comparables</b> in constant time. We will only consider problems where the solution is always one of the <b>comparables</b> in the problem instance (in our machine model, this is output in the form of an index between 1 and n). A min-max problem is such a problem where for any fixed structure A and number of <b>comparables</b> n, the resulting function fA,n: K n → K can be computed by a min-max circuit. The ordered version of a min-max problem is obtained by always supplying as additional input a permutation that non-decreasingly orders the list of <b>comparables.</b> Clearly, if the ordered version can be solved in time ξ(A,n), then by completely sorting the <b>comparables,</b> the original problem can be solved in O(n log n+ξ(A,n)) time and O(n log n) comparisons. However, it turns out that when n log n dominates over ξ(A,n), it is possible to improve both of these bounds simultaneously. In particular, we have the following results...|$|R

5|$|A white dwarf, {{also called}} a {{degenerate}} dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A white dwarf is very dense: its mass is <b>comparable</b> {{to that of}} the Sun, while its volume is <b>comparable</b> to that of Earth. A white dwarf's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion takes place in a white dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy. The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{valuation}} of accounting variables, growth opportunities, and insider retention for {{a sample of}} 1, 625 IPOs from three time-periods: 1986 - 1990, January 1997 through March 2000 (designated as the boom period), and April 2000 through December 2001 (designated as the crash period). Specifically, we test for valuation differences in the boom and crash relative to the more stable 1980 s. Additionally, we investigate whether accounting variables, growth, and insider retention of technology IPOs and internet IPOs are valued differently. Our major findings are as follows. For profitable non-tech firms in the 1980 s, income, sales, R&D, industry price-to-sales <b>comparables,</b> and insider retention are positively related to offer values. In the boom period, relative to the 1980 s, income, industry <b>comparables,</b> and insider retention are valued more. Sales, book value of equity, and R&D are valued less. The finding on income is surprising and contrary to claims made in the financial press. In the crash period, relative to the 1980 s, income is valued more, but R&D and industry <b>comparables</b> are valued less. We also document that, relative to the boom period, crash period sales were valued more, whereas insider retention and industry <b>comparables</b> were valued less. Relative to non-tec...|$|R

40|$|Comparability is {{the heart}} of {{transfer}} pricing. The OECD, U. K., Canadian, Australian, and U. S. transfer pricing rules all echo one another on how critically important the comparability analysis is. Performing this analysis and proving comparability, however, is a demanding exercise. What makes proving comparability so difficult is that the analysis is two sided. Both controlled and uncontrolled transactions must be thoroughly analyzed. Just as much effort needs to be applied to determine the functions, contract terms, risks and the economic conditions for the unrelated party <b>comparables</b> as is spent on analyzing the related parties (taxpayers). But there is more to this equation. On the “comparables side”, there are not one but two steps. First a <b>comparables</b> search is needed. Then the differences must be carefully scrutinized and adjust for differences if they are material. Case law has always demanded balanced or dual comparability analysis. The OECD however, has recently become critical of database dumps - the extensive automated financial database searches for potential <b>comparables</b> that are then dumped on (or presented to) tax authorities as-they-are. This is problematical. The search is being substituted for meaningful analysis. A database dump, no matter how well the screens are fit or how carefully crafted are the filters, never provides solid proof of <b>comparables.</b> This paper considers a sequence in US and Australian cases where arguments based heavily on database searches are involved. Observations are extended to Canada and the UK. The paper concludes that if searches for <b>comparables</b> in commercial databases are becoming the norm in transfer pricing {{and if there is a}} growing tendency to substitute the search itself for sound comparability analysis (the database dump), then what is the likely result on audit or through litigation is a profit split...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{reliability}} of using <b>comparables</b> in Italy-based companies to comply with acceptable transfer pricing methods. We adopt an indirect method, based on the comparison of the performances between foreign controlled companies (FCCs) and domestically-controlled companies (DCCs), to show that FCCs outperform their DCCs counterparts in terms of Return on Assets (ROA), {{especially in the case}} of small and medium enterprises. This result holds after controlling for differences in size, indus­try sector, regional location, capital structure and investment policies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the search for <b>comparables,</b> as prescribed by the OECD guidelines with the purpose to apply arm‟s length profit based methods, may need further refinements in the case of Italy-based companies. A large proportion of FCCs are outside the inter­quartile range of the ROA distribution of DCCs but not in the expected direction. Our findings contrast with previous empirical evidence on international transfer pricing (ITP) practice in that FCCs perform better or as well as DCCs indicating that the comparability method suggested by the OECD may be defective if pan-regional or local <b>comparables</b> are used...|$|R

The empirical results suggest that valuation with a selection of <b>comparables</b> firms on the basis of sector and ROA or sector and size is more accurate; moreover, valuation improves when multiples are averaged using median relative to arithmetic and harmonic mean. Secondly, to test the effectiveness of the main multiples (price/earnings, price/book value, price/sales, enterprise value/sales, enterprise value/book value, enterprise value/EBIT, enterprise value/EBITDA, enterprise value/free cash flow) in determining company value. We also analyze how factors such as sector, size and year bias these outcomes. The results show that the multiples based on cash flows are almost always significant; the multiples based on earnings are more significant in industrial sectors and in particular for small firms and with many intangible assets; the multiples on book value appear more effective for non-industrial firms.
