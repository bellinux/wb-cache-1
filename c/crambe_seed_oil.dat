A newly developed transgenic <b>Crambe</b> line produces <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> with 68 % erucic acid compared to 53 % in the wild type oil. ResultsFurther enrichment of erucic acid from Crambe (wild type and transgenic) oil was achieved by selective enzymatic hydrolysis.

The highest content of erucic acid achieved in that fraction was 95 %.

However, {{there have been no}} effective methodologies for evaluating the physiological quality of <b>crambe</b> <b>seeds.</b> Seed lots have not been compared, especially by vigor tests, such as the accelerated aging. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of high temperature and exposure periods on the physiological quality and enzymatic activity of <b>crambe</b> <b>seeds</b> during the accelerated aging test. Two lots of <b>crambe</b> <b>seeds</b> of the Brilhante cultivar were analyzed by tests of moisture content, weight of 1, 000 seeds, germination, first count, electrical conductivity, enzymatic activity (peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) and seedling length. All tests were carried out before and after the accelerated aging, which evaluated different temperatures (38, 40 and 42 ºC) and exposure periods (24, 48 and 72 hours). The experimental design was completely randomized with four replications. Variance analysis and mean comparison through the Tukey and Dunnet tests (p < 0. 05) were applied for statistical analysis and means were also submitted to the linear correlation test.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Crambe</b> <b>seed</b> (<b>Crambe</b> abyssinica) is an excellent, {{recently}} established {{source of}} high-erucic acid oil. Erucic acid {{has a number}} of important and potential applications. To de-velop this potential, a rapid bench-scale method was desired whereby purified erucic acid in up to several 100 -g quantities could be produced from <b>crambe</b> <b>seed.</b> Using the method devel-oped, oil was expressed from dried, intact seed; clarified, degummed, and bleached; and saponified and acidified to ob-tain the free fatty acids. Analysis by inductively coupled plasma of the free fatty acids showed negligible levels of phosphorus and most minerals. Erucic acid was twice crystallized from 95 % ethanol at − 14 °C, resulting in a purity of 87. 1 %. This process yielded 365 g erucic acid crystals per kg bleached oil. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis showed that the prepared erucic acid had an excellent pattern of correlation with a commercial standard. The time needed to convert 1 kg of <b>crambe</b> <b>seed</b> to erucic acid is about 48 h. Crystal filtration and drying stages under the current process conditions require 30 % of the overall time. The method is suitable for producing adequate quantities of erucic acid for use in studies of its bench-scale conversion. There is obviously, still, a fruitful field of work to be explored in the formalization of refining procedures for crambe oil.

However, <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content as an adaptive trait in plants is poorly understood. Here, we examine the adaptive nature of <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content in 168 angiosperm families occurring in different biomes across the world. We also explore the role of multiple seed traits like <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition in plant adaptation in a phylogenetic and nonphylogenetic context. Result: It was observed that the <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content in tropical plants (28. 4 %) {{was significantly higher than}} the temperate plants (24. 6 %). A significant relationship between oil content and latitude was observed in three families Papaveraceae, Sapindaceae and Sapotaceae indicating that selective forces correlated with latitude influence <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content. Evaluation of the response of <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition to latitude and the correlation between <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition showed that multiple <b>seed</b> traits, <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition contribute towards plant adaptation. Investigation of {{the presence or absence of}} phylogenetic signals across 168 angiosperm families in 62 clades revealed that members of seven clades evolved to have high or low <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content independently as they did not share a common evolutionary path. Conclusion: The study provides us an insight into the biogeographical distribution and the adaptive role of <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content in plants.

Among them, aldehydes presented the highest proportion of the overall volatiles in rapeseed oil (76. 8 % of the total volatiles), followed by sesame <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> (25 % of the total volatiles), pumpkin seed (5. 45 % of the total volatiles), flax <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> (2. 5 % of the total volatiles) and sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> (0. 95 % of the total volatiles). Terpenes (41 detected) were the dominant compounds in sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> and pumpkin <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> (93. 9 and 87. 8 % of the total terpenes, respectively), followed by flax <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> (47. 6 % of the total terpenes), sesame <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> (21. 5 % of the total terpenes) and rapeseed oil (10 % of total the terpenes). Sunflower seed and pumpkin <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> showed {{the highest number of}} volatile compounds identified, with the highest number of terpenes and esters within the investigated products...|$|R
50|$|The {{volumes of}} Allanblackia seeds, and hence <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> {{produced}} until now very low. The volume of allanblackia <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> {{is in the}} range of 100 metric tonnes per annum only.|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} Western Australian sandalwood (Santalum spicatum) <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> and {{chemically defined}} it for cosmetic and pharmaceutical use. Parameters for {{the selection of}} suitable raw material sources were established. A novel supercritical carbon dioxide extraction method was developed to isolate the <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> and its stability established. Isolated triximenynin and its pharmacological activities were studied. Sandalwood <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> was non-toxic and non-irritant from in-vitro studies...|$|R
40|$|<b>Seed</b> <b>oil</b> from species viz.,Khaya senegalensis plant {{belonging}} to Meliaceae {{family has been}} analyzed for physico-chemical properties by IR, NMR, TLC, and GLC techniques. The <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> resembled the simple ‘linoleic-oleic-palmitic’ type. The chief components among unsaturated acids are oleic and linoleic together forming 18. 20 - 72. 50 % of total components of acids. Among saturated acids, palmitic acid {{is present in the}} range of 10. 90 - 40. 90 %. Khaya senegalensis <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> containing 72. 50 % of oleic acid is very unusual. The <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> is screened for LD 50 studies, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities...|$|R
50|$|Meadowfoam <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> is an edible <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> {{extracted}} from the seeds of Limnanthes alba (meadowfoam). The <b>seeds</b> contain 20-30% <b>oil.</b> Meadowfoam <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> is extraordinarily stable, primarily because it contains over 98% long chain fatty acids. Meadowfoam oil is most similar to rapeseed oil, with which it competes directly for the high-volume industrial oilseed applications. Meadowfoam oil is widely used in cosmetic and hair-care applications due to its stability, lubricity and ability {{to stay on the}} skin.|$|R
40|$|Detection of {{adulteration}} in camellia <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> {{and sesame}} oil using an electronic nose An electronic nose {{was used for}} the detection of maize oil adulteration in camellia <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> and sesame oil. The results of multivariate analysis of variance showed that the sensor signals of different kinds of oil are significantly different from each other. Prin-cipal component analysis (PCA) cannot be used to discriminate the adulteration of camellia <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> but can be used in the discrimination of adulteration in sesame oil. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is more effective than PCA and can be used in adulteration discrimination for both camellia <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> and sesame oil. In order to check the discriminative power of LDA, canonical discriminant analysis was performed as well. Acceptable results were also obtained: The accuracy of prediction was 83. 6 % for camellia <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> and 94. 5 % for sesame oil. The artificial neural network (ANN) model was used to detect the percentage of adulteration in camellia <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> and sesame oil. The results showed that, based on ANN as its pattern recognition technique, the elec-tronic nose cannot predict the percentage of adulteration in camellia <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> but can be used in the quantitative determination of adulteration in sesame oil...|$|R
