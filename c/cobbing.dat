5|$|While 18thcentury metal mines {{had worked}} on the {{principle}} of adult men digging the ore and women and children picking and <b>cobbing</b> the ore ready for smelting, in the new large-scale mines of the early 19thcentury working practices changed. The strenuous underground work was still carried out by male workers, as was breaking large rocks with heavy hammers ('ragging'). In copper mines, very young girls, and sick and injured older women, carried out the simple work of picking. Girls in their late teens forced the broken ore through a broad mesh to sort the ore ('riddling'), and used hammers to break the large chunks of ore left by the riddling process into smaller chunks. Girls in their mid-teens cobbed the resulting chunks, separating the valuable ore from waste rock. Grown women would carry out the heavy manual labour of breaking rocks with hammers ('spalling'), of crushing sorted ore to small grains ready for smelting ('bucking') and of transporting ore between various pieces of apparatus. An experienced bal maiden working as a spaller would produce approximately one ton (2240lb; 1016kg) of broken ore per day, {{depending on the type of}} stone. In the tin mines, in which ore could be crushed far more finely than copper before smelting, <b>cobbing</b> and bucking did not take place. Instead, the chunks of spalled ore were mechanically stamped to fine grains, and washed into a series of collecting pits to separate the coarse 'rough' from the fine 'slimes'. The resulting rough and slimes were separated out on large wooden frames ('buddling' and 'framing' respectively), to extract the tin ore from the surrounding dust and grit.|$|E
5|$|From the 1840s onwards more mines {{provided}} crude shelters {{to protect}} surface {{workers from the}} worst of the weather, but at many others work at surface-level took place in the open air. Workers were generally expected to remain at their posts except in the most extreme weather conditions. Bal maidens wore gooks, a specialised bonnet which covered the shoulders and extended over the face to protect from rain, bright sunlight, flying debris and loud noise. In the winter the gook was made of felt, and in summer of cotton. Working in close proximity to heavy industrial machinery, they wore shorter dresses or skirts than the ankle-length clothing typical of the period, and their exposed lower legs were wrapped in protective coverings. Their arms were sometimes protected by hessian sleeves worn over their clothes. Some bal maidens working in <b>cobbing</b> and bucking wore rubber tubing on the fingers of one hand as protection from their hammer. While working bal maidens wore a waist-length hessian apron ('towser') over their clothes, and those who could afford it would have a white herden (flax and hemp) apron for wearing to and from work. These working clothes were accessorised with flowers, bows, ribbons, jewellery and other decoration. Until the end of the 19thcentury the working clothing of a bal maiden changed very little.|$|E
25|$|As the Beats {{and other}} American poets began to find readers in the UK and Ireland, a new {{generation}} of British poets with an interest in modernist experimentation began to appear. These poets, who included Tom Raworth, Bob <b>Cobbing,</b> Gael Turnbull and others formed the nucleus of the British Poetry Revival.

40|$|We {{previously}} generated separate {{lines of}} transgenic mice that specifically overexpress either the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF- 2) {{low molecular weight}} isoform (TgLMW) or the high molecular weight isoforms (TgHMW) in the osteoblast lineage. Vector/control (TgVector) mice were also made. Here we report use of isolated calvarial osteoblasts (<b>COBs)</b> from those mice to investigate whether the FGF- 2 protein isoforms differentially modulate bone formation in vitro. Our hypothesis states that FGF- 2 isoforms specifically modulate bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP- 2) function and subsequently, bone differentiation genes and their related signaling pathways. We found {{a significant increase in}} alkaline phosphatase (ALP) positive colonies in TgLMW <b>COBs</b> compared with TgVector controls. BMP- 2 treatment significantly increased mineralized colonies in TgVector and TgLMW <b>COBs.</b> BMP- 2 caused a further significant increase in mineralized colonies in TgLMW <b>COBs</b> compared with TgVector <b>COBs</b> but did not increase ALP positive colonies in TgHMW <b>COBs.</b> Time course studies showed that BMP- 2 caused a sustained increase in SMAD 1 / 5 / 8, Runx- 2, and Osterix protein in TgLMW <b>COBs.</b> BMP- 2 caused a sustained increase in phospho-p 38 MAP kinase in TgVector but only a transient increase in TgLMW and TgHMW <b>COBs.</b> BMP- 2 caused a transient increase in phospho-p 44 / 42 MAP kinase in TgVector <b>COBs,</b> no increase in TgLMW <b>COBs</b> but a sustained increase was found in TgHMW <b>COBs.</b> Basal expression of FGF receptor 1 (FGFR 1) protein was significantly increased in TgLMW <b>COBs</b> relative to TgVector <b>COBs</b> and, while BMP- 2 caused a transient increase in FGFR 1 expression in TgVector <b>COBs</b> and TgHMW <b>COBs,</b> there was no further increase TgLMW <b>COBs.</b> Interestingly, while basal expression of FGF receptor 2 (FGFR 2) was similar in <b>COBs</b> from all genotypes, BMP- 2 treatment caused a sustained increase in TgLMW <b>COBs</b> but decreased FGFR 2 in TgVector COBS and TgHMW <b>COBs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Accurate trace-metal and strontium-isotope {{analyses}} of archaeological corn <b>cobs</b> require that metal contaminants be removed prior to chemical analysis. Archaeological <b>cobs</b> are often coated with construction debris, dust, or soilwhich contains mineral particles. In addition, most archaeological <b>cobs</b> are partially or completely burned and the burned parts incorporate mineral debris in their hardened residual structures. Unburned <b>cobs</b> are weak ion exchangers and most metals within a <b>cob</b> are not firmly bound to <b>cob</b> organic matter; therefore, immersing <b>cobs</b> in acids and rinsing them in deionized water to remove mineral contaminants {{may result in}} the undesirable loss of metals, including strontium, from the <b>cob.</b> In this paper we show that some <b>cob</b> metal-pair ratios are not substantially changed when the <b>cob</b> is ‘‘cleaned’’ with deionized water, if the water-cob contact time does not exceed five minutes. Additionally, we introduce a method for eliminating mineral contaminants in both burned and unburned <b>cobs,</b> thus rendering them acceptable for strontium-isotope analysis. However, the decontamination procedure results in the rapid non-stoichiometric leaching of trace metals from the unburned <b>cobs</b> {{and it is possible}} that most metals will be extracted from the <b>cobs</b> during the lengthy decontamination process.

60|$|We got our scous after this, but {{the negro}} logged the whole transaction, as one may suppose. He was {{particularly}} set against me, as I had been ringleader in the <b>cobbing.</b> The weather continued bad, the watches were much fagged, {{and the ship}} gave no grog. At length I could stand it no longer, or thought I could not; and I led down betwixt decks, tapped a cask of gin, introduced the stem of a clean pipe and took a nip at the bowl. All my watch smoked this pipe pretty regularly, first at one cask and then at another, until we got into port. The larboard watch did the same, and I do think the strong liquor helped us along that time. As bad luck would have it, the cook's wood was stowed among the casks, and, one morning, just {{as the last of}} us had knocked off smoking, we saw the wool of this gentleman heaving in sight, through the hatch by which we went down. Still, nothing was said until we came to be paid off, when the darky came out with his yarn. I owned it all, and insisted we never could have brought the ship in, unless we had got the gin. I do believe both captain and owner were sorry we had been complained of, but they could not overlook the matter. I was mulcted five-and-twenty dollars, and left the ship. I know I did wrong, and I know that the owners did what was right; but I cannot help thinking, bad as gin is on a long pull, that this did us good. I was not driven from the ship; on the contrary, both master and Owners wished me to remain; but I felt a little savage, and quitted their employment.|$|E

40|$|Present {{study was}} aimed to {{investigate}} the genotypic and phenotypic association among grain yield components and their direct and indirect effects on yield. Correlation studies revealed significant positive genotypic and phenotypic relationship of grain yield with <b>cob</b> position, rows per <b>cob</b> and grains per row. <b>Cob</b> height, number of grains per row, stem diameter and <b>cob</b> girth had high positive direct effects on grain yield. <b>Cob</b> position had high negative direct effect on yield. These result depicted that <b>cob</b> position, no. of rows per <b>cob</b> and no. of grains per <b>cob</b> {{may be used as}} reliable criteria for improving grain yield. Heritability and genetic advance estimates described the genetic attributes of the traits under study. All the traits except no. of rows per <b>cob</b> and no. of grains per row had non additive type of gene action with high heritability and low genetic advance. The exploitation of these traits would be effective in hybrid maize breeding. No. of rows per <b>cob</b> and no. of grains per row showed both additive and non additive type of gene action with environmental influence due to high environmental variance. These traits can be utilized effectively through selection in varietal development...|$|R

40|$|Presentation given during thesis defense {{regarding}} {{an evaluation}} of shear resistance of reinforced <b>cob.</b> Four specimens were created: two with the plastic silt <b>cob</b> mixture (one specimen containing chicken wire reinforcement) and two with the pure kaolinite <b>cob</b> mixture (one specimen containing chicken wire reinforcement). The samples were tested in a simple shear box. Load, deformation, and image analysis data were collected. Analysis shows {{that there is a}} trend that reinforcement has an effect on the ductility of the <b>cob</b> material. <b>Cob,</b> similar to adobe, is an earthen building material made of soil, sand, and straw. Although <b>cob</b> was used to build homes in England centuries ago, it has reemerged as a sustainable and relatively inexpensive, alternative building material. A possible solution for housing in impoverished nations, <b>cob</b> needs to be studied more in order to provide reliable strength data so that the material can be codified. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if the use of chicken wire as reinforcement in a <b>cob</b> wall had an effect on the shear strength of the <b>cob</b> wall. Using two types of soil (a plastic silt and a pure kaolinite), four <b>cob</b> wall panels were created, with one of each soil type being reinforced with chicken wire. The wall panels were tested in a shear box to simulate earthquake loading. The results of this study indicated that the kaolinite specimens showed a trend that the reinforced <b>cob</b> wall panel required a greater load than the unreinforced <b>cob</b> panel in order to deform the same amount.

40|$|The {{advantages}} of maize <b>cobs</b> as cellulosic feedstock {{are based on}} their compact architecture and high fraction of cellulose and hemicellulose. <b>Cobs</b> are low in ash content, nutrients, and minerals and their harvest will likely not deplete the soil. Dual-purpose maize, with larger <b>cob</b> biomass and high tissue density, could reduce transport costs providing more farmers with additional income from <b>cob</b> sales. The objective {{of this study was}} to lay the foundation for developing dual-purpose maize, combining high <b>cob</b> biomass and grain yield. This included a morphological and genetic analysis of <b>cob</b> characters under varying environments, as well as their relationships to grain yield. In addition, as starting point for further research of <b>cob</b> biomass traits, novel germplasm was developed including a biparental doubled haploid population. Overall, grain yield was positively correlated with all <b>cob</b> architecture traits but independent from <b>cob</b> density. Gene mapping experiments were performed in two different two intermated B 73 x Mo 17 (IBM) populations under varying nitrogen managements. For <b>cob</b> tissue density, two of the largest QTL were identified in both IBM populations on chromosomes 5 and 7 each explaining 7. 7 - 10. 7 % of the phenotypic variation. These regions are known to contain candidate genes ra 1 and ba 2, involved in branching and branch elongation. Available maize accessions with extreme <b>cob</b> architecture likely carry novel alleles or genes for <b>cob</b> size and tissue density. Using this potential from new resources in combination with the findings and summarized information for <b>cob</b> biomass genetics from this research further progress with developing dual purpose maize varieties can be accomplished...|$|R
