The typical configuration of such GISs is double bar with two transmission line bays, two transformer bays and a <b>coupling</b> <b>bay.</b> Overhead transmission lines and power transformers are connected to the GIS using either insulated cables or Gas Insulated Lines (GILs) of different length. The protection of the power transformers against lightning overvoltages is performed with surge arresters at the connection point of the overhead lines with either the insulated cables or the GILs. This paper reports an exhaustive study conducted by Iberdrola aimed at assessing the performance of the protective scheme in three configurations in both 132 kV and 220 kV stations: 1. Power transformers are connected to the GIS using GILSs. Overhead lines are connected to the GIS also using GILs. 2. Power transformers are connected to the GIS using insulated cables. Overhead lines are connected to the GIS also using insulated cables. 3. Power transformers are connected to the GIS using insulated cables. Overhead lines are connected to the GIS using GILs. Very detailed models of the stations for electromagnetic transient simulation have been developed using manufacturer data of the GISs, insulated cables, GILs, power transformers and surge arresters. The study has comprised simulation of a reference case of each configuration and several sensitivity studies with respect to the length of the insulated cables and the GILs. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

50|$|Container ships sailing for {{the company}} under the OCL banner were characterised by their green hulls with white topping, white {{superstructure}} and green funnels bearing the initials OCL in white letters. All OCL ships' names ended in Bay, such as Encounter Bay, Tokyo Bay, Liverpool Bay, Resolution Bay and Mairangi Bay. Subsidiary operations such as the Australia- Japan Container Line did not follow this trend, instead having names such as Arafura and Aotea. When OCL became P&OCL, {{there was a slight}} modification to the ships' colour scheme, the hulls becoming completely green and the OCL logo on the funnels being replaced with the P&O logo. The naming convention was retained, and in June 2006 there were still a <b>couple</b> of <b>Bay</b> ships in the Maersk Line fleet.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical investigation {{of an active}} structural acoustic control strategy for <b>coupled</b> aircraft-style <b>bays.</b> While structural <b>coupling</b> can destabilize or limit the performance of some model-based decentralized control systems, fullycoupled centralized control strategies are impractical for typical aircraft containing several hundred bays. An alternative is to use classical rate feedback with matched, collocated transducer pairs to achieve active damping. Unfortunately, due to the conservative nature of this strategy, stability is guaranteed {{at the expense of}} achievable noise reduction. Therefore, this paper describes the development of a combined control strategy using robust active damping in addition to a high-authority controller based on linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) theory. The combined control system is evaluated on a tensioned, two-bay model using piezoceramic actuators and ideal point velocity sensors. Transducer placement on the two-bay structure is discussed, and the advantages of a combined control strategy are presented...|$|R

5000|$|The {{rerouting}} of {{the flow}} of freshwater to the <b>Bay</b> <b>coupled</b> with periods of drought have caused massive seagrass die-offs. The first major die-off occurred from 1987 to 1991 as thousands of hectares of turtlegrass beds (Thalassia testudinum) were devastated by high levels of toxic dissolved sulfide. 10,000 acres died in the central and western bay, and almost 60,000 additional acres suffered reduced productivity and biomass as a result. Then, following the 2015 drought, extreme temperatures and heightened salinity reduced the amount of oxygen that could remain dissolved in the water, causing periods of anoxia during nighttime and thereby damaging the health of the turtlegrass in the bay. During the summer and fall of 2015, approximately 40,000 areas of seagrass died.|$|R

Madison was declared permanent capital in November, 1836, and construction at the new city began in 1837.|$|R
40|$|Natural {{geography}} and causeways have divided the Great Salt Lake into four bays with limited, but important connections. Most pollutants from cities in Utah flow into Farmington Bay, {{and to a}} lesser extent, into Bear River Bay before entering Gilbert Bay. Routine monitoring at the outflows of Farmington and Bear River Bays and synoptic sampling at 34 stations was done in 2006 to understand how these bays may control nutrient loading and the trophic state in Gilbert Bay. Optical brighteners (wastewater treatment plant tracers) were very high in Farmington and sometimes in Bear River Bay, but were low in Gilbert Bay. Nitrogen and phosphorus loadings to Gilbert Bay were dominated by Bear River inflows during spring runoff, but during summer, loading from hypereutrophic Farmington Bay predominated. MODIS satellite imagery documented plumes of phytoplankton-rich water flowing out of Farmington Bay and extending up to 20 km across Gilbert Bay. Isotopic analyses of 13 C and 15 N indicated, however, that the high algal production in Farmington Bay did not contribute substantially to the diets of brine shrimp in Gilbert Bay, at least during the May, June and November synoptic analyses. The management of nutrient loading and other pollutants in the Great Salt Lake will need {{to take into account the}} close <b>coupling</b> of the <b>bays...</b>|$|R

40|$|In Part I Florida Bay {{is used as}} a {{model to}} {{describe}} some influences of environment on chemical variations of shell material. Geographic isolation and high evaporation in the <b>Bay</b> <b>coupled</b> with the influx of fresh water enriched in O 18 produce a gradient of increasing H 2 O 18 going into the Bay. Dilution of Bay water by Ca rich fresh water lowers the Sr/Ca ratio in the Bay. The gradient of H 2 O 18 in the water is clearly reflected in a similar gradient in the carbonate oxygen of mollusk shells. The effect of temperature on the carbonate isotopic composition is shown to be inadequate to explain the variations. Sr/Ca ratios of the shells vary but show no simple relationship to environment. A gradient of decreasing C 13 in shells going into the Bay is attributed to the equilibration of CO 2 derived by oxidation of organic debris with the carbonate of the water. Analyses of mollusks from sediment cores show that the present environmental framework of Florida Bay has existed for the last 3700 years. Analysis of the fine-grained sediment of the Bay suggests that part of it is washed in from the mainland. In Part II fossil mollusks from the Pleistocene Caloosahatchee formation are analyzed. The O 18 /O 16 ratios coupled with geological and faunal data indicate an environmental framework strikingly similar to the Florida Bay model. A land mass immediately west of the outcrop area is postulated for most of Caloosahatchee time. The carbon isotope and strontium data reveal little environmental information...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{high degree}} of {{physical}} factors in intertidal estuarine ecosystem increases material processing between benthic and pelagic compartments. In these ecosystems, microphytobenthos resuspension is a major phenomenon since its contribution to higher trophic levels can be highly significant. Understanding the sediment and associated microphytobenthos resuspension and its fate {{in the water column}} is indispensable for measuring the food available to benthic and pelagic food webs. To identify and hierarchize the physical/biological factors potentially involved in MPB resuspension, the entire intertidal area and surrounding water column of an estuarine ecosystem, the Bay des Veys, was sampled during ebb tide. A wide range of physical parameters (hydrodynamic regime, grain size of the sediment, and suspended matter) and biological parameters (flora and fauna assemblages, chlorophyll) were analyzed to characterize benthic-pelagic <b>coupling</b> at the <b>bay</b> scale. Samples were collected in two contrasted periods, spring and late summer, {{to assess the impact of}} forcing variables on benthic-pelagic coupling. A mapping approach using kriging interpolation enabled us to overlay benthic and pelagic maps of physical and biological variables, for both hydrological conditions and trophic indicators. Pelagic Chl a concentration was the best predictor explaining the suspension-feeders spatial distribution. Our results also suggest a perennial spatio-temporal structure of both benthic and pelagic compartments in the ecosystem, at least when the system is not imposed to intense wind, with MPB distribution controlled by both grain size and bathymetry. The benthic component appeared to control the pelagic one via resuspension phenomena at the scale of the bay. Co-inertia analysis showed closer benthic-pelagic coupling between the variables in spring. The higher MPB biomass observed in summer suggests a higher contribution to filter-feeders diets, indicating a higher resuspension effect in summer than in spring, in turn suggesting an important role of macrofauna bioturbation and filter feeding (Cerastoderma edule) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{breeding}} {{biology of}} shelduck at Aberlady Bay in 1976 {{is described in}} detail and possible factors affecting breeding success are discussed. Factors affecting nest site selection were determined. Both parliament site and nest site tended to be {{as close as possible}} to a pair's feeding area within the bay, which was chosen in early spring. Artificial nest boxes were used to study individual birds during the breeding season. The rhythm of egg production was irregular for all birds studied. The mean rate of egg production was O. 63 eggs day(^- 1), and clutch size 9. 3 + 2. 4 eggs. Laying occurred between 15 th April and 2 nd July, the mean incubation period being 32. 2 + 1. 2 days. Hatching success varied between 80 - 100 %. There was little evidence of predation although there was some evidence of intraspecific disturbance and mechanisms by which it may occur are described. Ducklings appeared on the bay from the end of May until the first week in July. Thirty-six broods were brought onto the bay and most ducklings were taken to a main nursery area. Mechanisms leading to creching of ducklings are described. Creching v/as extensive, although mainly between ducklings of similar ages (and usually younger ducklings were involved). The largest creche observed contained 38 ducklings. Ducklings could be separated in the field into different age classes (I-IV). Mortality of Class I ducklings was found to be 8 l%. The first fledged duckling was seen on 16 th July. The distribution within the bay of invertebrate food items taken by shelduck was determined. The abundance of Hydrobia ulvae within the feeding ranges of breeding birds varied between 1 - 100 + dm(^- 3). Evidence suggested that sediment type may be important in affecting food availability in different parts of the bay. The feeding areas of individual ducks during the breeding season moved each year, either into, out of, or within the bay. Movement of feeding areas into the bay, particularly onto muddy or wet areas, usually resulted in successful breeding (duck seen with ducklings). Pairs feeding further into the bay or on muddy areas bred earlier than other pairs. Early breeding was thought to be beneficial for the maintenance of the parent/duckling bond, and survival of ducklings. Forty-two pairs were known to have bred between Musselburgh and North Berwick. The number of breeding pairs at Aberlady was thought to be restricted by competition for good feeding sites in the muddy or wetter areas of the <b>bay,</b> <b>coupled</b> with increased individual distance during the breeding season. Production of offspring at Aberlady Bay was found to be inadequate for maintenance of its population of shelduck (mainly due to high duckling mortality) and immigration from other areas was thought to occur, especially from areas with low densities of shelduck where production per pair appeared to be higher...|$|R
