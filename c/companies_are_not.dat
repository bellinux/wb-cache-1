5|$|New {{regulations}} {{in response to}} the scandals include the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 2004 in Australia as well as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, developed by the United States. Sarbanes-Oxley limits the level of work which can be carried out by accounting firms. In addition, the Act put a limit on the fee which a firm can receive from one client as a percentage of their total fees. This ensures that <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> wholly reliant on one firm for its income, in the hope that they do not need to act unethically to keep a steady income. The act also protects whistleblowers and requires senior management in public companies to sign off on the accuracy of its company's accounting records. In 2002, the five members of the Public Oversight Board (POB), which oversaw ethics within the accounting profession, resigned after critics deemed the board ineffective and the SEC proposed developing a new panel, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The PCAOB was developed through the Act, and replaced the POB.|$|E

2500|$|Air {{ambulance}} {{services in the}} United States can be operated {{by a variety of}} sources. Some services are hospital-operated, while others may be operated by Federal, State or local government; or through a variety of departments, including local or State police, the United States Park Service, or Fire Departments. [...] Such services may be operated directly by any of these EMS systems, or they may be contracted to a third-party provider, such as an aircraft charter company. [...] In addition, {{it is not uncommon for}} U.S. military helicopters to be pressed into service providing air ambulance support. [...] The vast distances covered by the U.S. mean that while helicopters may be the preferred form of service delivery for 'on-scene' emergencies, fixed wing aircraft, including small jets, are often used for transfers from rural hospitals to tertiary care sites. [...] These aircraft are typically staffed by a mix of personnel including physicians, nurses, and paramedics, and in some cases, by all three. [...] Publicly operated air ambulance service is supplemented by emergency and non-emergency air transport service, which may be provided by dedicated air ambulance companies, or by aircraft charter companies as a 'sideline' business operation. Air Ambulance <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> all considered the same. Some are brokers that farm-out the air medical transports other are highly accredited by accrediting organizations like CAMTS.|$|E
2500|$|Music producer, Steve Morales, took T Lopez to Miami, Florida {{to begin}} {{recording}} her own music. Later Lopez {{would join the}} cast of a TV cable network that caters to the bicultural Latino population called Sí TV, where she would co-hosts a Latin American music show, The Drop. Lopez continued acting, hosting, and recording music. After putting a few movies, multiple TV appearances, and an album's worth of songs under her belt, T Lopez met brothers and co-CEO's of Cash Money Records, Ronald [...] "Slim" [...] Williams and Bryan [...] "Baby" [...] Williams, and they invited her to visit their New Orleans, Louisiana home base. T Lopez was very impressed by their loyalty to each other, but she asked the guys if {{they really wanted to}} work with her and her music because it was so different. Slim is great, he takes great care of me and he is really involved in my project T Lopez said. T Lopez said that heads of <b>companies</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> always like that. Then T Lopez officially joined the Cash Money family and has not looked back since. T Lopez is currently recording on her as-yet-untitled solo debut album in Miami, Florida, with features from T-Pain, Daddy Yankee, Lil Wayne, Flo Rida, Glasses Malone, Colby O'Donis and Birdman.

There are certain faults, it may be, and weak points, which all of us deplore, and which are being remedied as fast as experience and the progress of human knowledge will admit, but I hold, gentlemen, that the management of railway companies is above the average management of many other companies. We have much more work--more dangerous work--to do than other companies, and we do it with much less proportional loss to life, limb, and property." ...|$|E
