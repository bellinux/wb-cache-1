5|$|On 13 December 1981, {{claiming}} {{that the country was}} on the verge of economic and civil breakdown, and alleging a danger of Soviet intervention, General Wojciech Jaruzelski began a <b>crack-down</b> on Solidarity. Martial law was declared, the free labor union was suspended and most of its leaders detained. Several thousand citizens were interned or imprisoned and much larger numbers were subjected to various forms of harassment. Polish state militia (Milicja Obywatelska, the police) and paramilitary riot police ZOMO suppressed the strike action and demonstrations. Military forces entered industrial enterprises to clamp down on the independent union movement. A series of violent attacks included the pacification of Wujek Coal Mine during which 9 people were killed. The martial law offensive was directed primarily against workers and their Union; they, rather than intelligentsia activists, were the object of the most brutal treatment. The authorities succeeded in imposing on members of Solidarity an individual and collective trauma, from which the broken mass movement would not be able to recover. The Catholic Church strove to exert on Solidarity a moderating influence both before and after the martial law.|$|E
5|$|Another {{source of}} crown income was {{represented}} by England's Jews. The Jews were the king's personal property, and {{he was free to}} tax them at will. By 1280, the Jews had been exploited to a level at which they were no longer of much financial use to the crown, but they could still be used in political bargaining. Their usury businessa practice forbidden to Christianshad made many people indebted to them and caused general popular resentment. In 1275, Edward had issued the Statute of the Jewry, which outlawed usury and encouraged the Jews to take up other professions; in 1279, {{in the context of a}} <b>crack-down</b> on coin-clippers, he arrested all the heads of Jewish households in England and had around 300 of them executed. In 1280, he ordered all Jews to attend special sermons, preached by Dominican friars, with the hope of persuading them to convert, but these exhortations were not followed. The final attack on the Jews in England came in the Edict of Expulsion in 1290, whereby Edward formally expelled all Jews from England. This not only generated revenues through royal appropriation of Jewish loans and property, but it also gave Edward the political capital to negotiate a substantial lay subsidy in the 1290 Parliament. The expulsion, which was reversed in 1656, followed a precedent set by other European territorial princes: Philip II of France had expelled all Jews from his own lands in 1182; John I, Duke of Brittany, drove them out of his duchy in 1239; and in the late 1240s Louis IX of France had expelled the Jews from the royal demesne before his first passage to the East.|$|E

25|$|Scarfo's {{imprisonment}} {{eventually led}} to another internal mob war. With {{the backing of the}} Gambino crime family in New York, John Stanfa was named boss of the Philadelphia crime family in 1991. However, a faction of young mobsters led by Joey Merlino disputed Stanfa's ascension, and by 1992 another war for control of the family was underway. The war ended in 1994 when Stanfa and most of his supporters were arrested by the FBI. Merlino subsequently took control of the family and has allegedly been running the family to varying degrees ever since. Unlike most of his Mafia contemporaries, Merlino was extremely prolific and never camera-shy, and was frequently seen partying or participating in local charity events. Inevitably, the Philadelphia crime family has been weakened over the past 30 years due to violence, internal warfare, government turncoats, and the general widespread <b>crack-down</b> by law enforcement on organized crime following the passage of the RICO Act. Despite this, the Philadelphia family still {{remains one of the most}} active Mafia families in the country.|$|E

500|$|On December 13, 1981, Jaruzelski began a <b>crack-down</b> on Solidarity, declaring {{martial law}} and {{creating}} a Military Council of National Salvation (Wojskowa Rada Ocalenia Narodowego, or WRON). Solidarity's leaders, gathered at Gdańsk, were arrested and isolated in facilities guarded by the Security Service (Służba Bezpieczeństwa or SB), and some 5,000 Solidarity supporters were arrested {{in the middle of}} the night. Censorship was expanded, and military forces appeared on the streets. A couple of hundred strikes and occupations occurred, chiefly at the largest plants and at several Silesian coal mines, but were broken by ZOMO paramilitary riot police. One of the largest demonstrations, on December 16, 1981, took place at the Wujek Coal Mine, where government forces opened fire on demonstrators, killing 9 and seriously injuring 22. [...] The next day, during protests at Gdańsk, government forces again fired at demonstrators, killing 1 and injuring 2. By December 28, 1981, strikes had ceased, and Solidarity appeared crippled. The last strike in the 1981 Poland, which ended on December 28, took place in the Piast Coal Mine in the Upper Silesian town of Bieruń. It was the longest underground strike in the history of Poland, lasting 14 days. Some 2000 miners began it on December 14, going 650 meters underground. Out of the initial 2000, half remained until the last day. Starving, they gave up after military authorities promised they would not be prosecuted. On October 8, 1982, Solidarity was banned.|$|E

It also found that Ireland sends more people of Asian origin to jail for cannabis growing than Irish people. Courts and criminal authorities are not taking into account that the people may be modern-day slaves, the report found. “People have been found malnourished and terrified in houses locked from the outside, yet they were still treated as criminals and given heavy prison sentences,” said Virginija Petrauskaite of the Migrant Rights Centre, which carried out the study. There has been a major increase in the amount of cannabis grown in Ireland in recent years, with a subsequent rise in garda <b>crack-downs</b> on the operations.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a detailed analysis}} of patterns of income genera-tion among 202 active heroin users in South West Sydney. We explore both sources of income and the relative contribution of different types of income generating activities, including drug sales and related activities, property crime, prostitution, legitimate income and avoided expenditures. Despite claims that heroin use leads inevitably to property crime, drug market activities accounted for a greater proportion of drug user income in this sample. Results indicate that law enforcement <b>crack-downs</b> that reduce opportunities for generating income from the drug market may increase property crime by heroin users. Acquisitive property crime has significant social and economic costs. A recent estimate suggests that between two and three billion dollars worth of property is stolen from homes, shops, cars, factories and warehouses in Australia each year (Freiberg, 1997, p. 237). Very little of this property is recovered and a large amount presumably finds its way onto the stolen property market in various ways (Allen, 2000). Four groups of offenders can be identified as major contributors to the property crime market: burglars (Jochelson, 1995) : large-scale shoplifter...|$|R
40|$|With minimal {{information}} on sexual health provision during mass-gathering events, our {{aim was to}} describe the use of sexual health, contraceptive, sex worker and sexual assault services during the London 2012 Olympics. We analysed data from five sources. One contraceptive service provider reported a 10 % increase in attendance during the main Games, while emergency contraception prescriptions rose during the main Olympics, compared to the week before, but were similar or lower than {{at the beginning and end}} of the summer period. A health telephone advice line reported a 16 % fall in sexual health-related calls during the main Olympics, but a 33 % increase subsequently. London sexual assault referral centres reported that 1. 8 % of sexual assaults were Olympics-linked. A service for sex workers reported that 16 % started working in the sex industry and 7 % moved to London to work during the Olympics. Fifty-eight per cent and 45 % of sex workers reported fewer clients and an increase in police <b>crack-downs,</b> respectively. Our results show a change in activity across these services during the 2012 summer, which may be associated with the Olympics. Our data are a guide to other services when anticipating changes in service activity and planning staffing for mass-gathering events...|$|R

2500|$|Critics {{have charged}} that ASEAN is too soft in its {{approach}} to promoting human rights and democracy, particularly in junta-led Burma. Some scholars think that non-interference has hindered ASEAN efforts to handle the problems of Myanmar, human rights abuse, and haze pollution in the area. Despite global outrage at the military <b>crack-down</b> on unarmed protesters in Yangon, ASEAN has refused to suspend Burma as a member, and also rejects proposals for economic sanctions. This has caused concern as the European Union has refused to conduct free trade negotiations at a regional level for these political reasons. Some international observers view ASEAN as a [...] "talk shop", stating that the organisation is: [...] "big on words, but small on action". [...] "ASEAN policies {{have proven to be}} mostly rhetoric, rather than actual implementation", according to Pokpong Lawansiri, a Bangkok-based independent analyst of ASEAN. [...] "It has been noted that less than 50% of ASEAN agreements are actually implemented, while ASEAN holds more than six hundred meetings annually".|$|E
40|$|In a Bangkok mall a {{fibreglass}} policeman {{warning against}} intellectual property (IP) piracy stands just metres away from vendors selling fake DVDs; a scene indicative of incomplete and unsuccessful attempts by foreign governments (the US and EU in particular) and corporate actors at enrolment towards ever-higher IP standards – the ‘IP ratchet’ that Drahos (2004 Intellectual property and pharmaceutical markets: a nodal governance approach Temple Law Review 77 401 – 24) describes. But the scene also reflects cultural resistance {{at the local}} level. Both readings exemplify the range of historical, cultural, and politico-legal factors at play {{that can only be}} understood through engagement with vendors and consumers in the markets and malls of Bangkok. IP laws may achieve partial ‘closure’ but are regularly changing, contested, variably enforced, and subject to existing social norms such as the ‘cult of imitation’, cultures of legal informality, and a lack of social contract. We found that this lack of legal closure was most pronounced in the day-to-day operation of the Pratunam Market. Whilst other sites host regular <b>crack-downs</b> by police, the IP-specific DSI force, and the Thai courts, markets like Pratunam are mostly immune despite being a transnational trade node for the production and export of counterfeit garments with other developing countries, and a non-conforming node in the IP enforcement context. In the face of persistent efforts to transpose Euro-American IP laws in countries like Thailand, alternative and resistant nodes representing ‘spaces of interlegalities’ are likely to persevere because of the historical context, and the socio-cultural norms of these places...|$|R
5000|$|Signorile wrote {{columns and}} feature stories for The Advocate for several years, {{including}} the groundbreaking two-part cover story [...] "Out at The New York Times"—in which the paper's {{gay and lesbian}} staffers, its top editors and its then-new publisher, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr., spoke for the first time, to Signorile, about years of homophobia at the paper of record {{and how they were}} charting a new course. In 1994, Signorile left the Advocate for the then new glossy, Out magazine, which was founded by his friend and OutWeek colleague Michael Goff and former OutWeek editor Sarah Pettit. In 1995 Signorile published his second book, Outing Yourself, a 14-step program for coming out as gay or lesbian.At that time, as an Out magazine columnist and editor-at-large, Signorile soon {{was at the center of}} often-heated debates among gay activists, sexual liberationists and HIV prevention experts about gay male sexual culture and the prevalence of unsafe sex and HIV transmission. Signorile wrote a column for Out that sparked much discussion, titled [...] "Unsafe Like Me," [...] in which he addressed the issue by admitting to have slipped up himself, having had an incident of unprotected sex, and discussed what may have led someone like him—a prominent AIDS activist, immersed in the issues of prevention—to have such a lapse. The column was adapted to the op-ed page of The New York Times and inspired a CBS [...] "60 Minutes" [...] treatment of the issue in which Signorile was profiled. Signorile followed up that column with several others that focused on what he saw as some unhealthy aspects of gay culture that contributed to low self-esteem and risk-taking. This eventually grew into his 1997 bestseller Life Outside: The Signorile Report on Gay Men: Sex, Drugs, Muscles and the Passages of Life, which was a finalist for the New York Public Library Book Award for Excellence in Journalism. The columns and the book created controversy among some activists; Signorile was criticized by the group Sex Panic! which believed that he and other writers had inspired government <b>crack-downs</b> on gay sex through their writings. Many other commentators and activists disagreed with Signorile's critics, and fierce debates broke out in both gay and mainstream media. Signorile also inspired much discussion and debate with pieces in Out on pro-life gays, animals rights vs. medical research, gay marriage and high-profile antigay hate crimes.|$|R
