40|$|Introduction In {{this short}} note, we point out some {{undesirable}} characteristics {{appearing in the}} streamcipher Edon 80. We refer readers to the original paper [1] for all notation and terms. Our discussion will center mostly on the key determining the quasigroup operations i (i = 0,... 79) and the initial state (a 0,..., a 79) obtained right after the IVSetup operation. These two will {{be referred to as}} key-state pair from now on. This note presents many key-state pairs that would lead to a keystream of period 2. We also argue the existence of key-IV pairs that produce keystreams of period extremely smaller than 2, the value designers had projected as <b>cipher</b> <b>period.</b> 2 Undesirable key-state pairs We wish to instantiate Table 4 of [1] {{in such a way that}} the bottom row is a sequence of period 4. This would produce a keystream of period 2. 2. 1 Partial key-state pairs Consider the following series of quasigroup string e-transformations. i 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0.... ...|$|E
