Triplicate plates of 10μL of recovered cultures as well as dilutions of 10−1, 10−2, and 10−3 were then spotted and incubated overnight at 30°C and CFU, or colony forming unit, assessments were then made to identify successful mutants using the miniaturized plating method described previously. Once the mutation of interest was screened using overnight growth on M9 minimal medium plates supplemented with glycerol, chloroacetate and SOC (super optimal broth with <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression),</b> colonies were patched onto selective plates using a toothpick and incubated at 30°C for two nights. After sufficient colony growth, cells were transfected with the pKDsg-XXX plasmid containing the aada gene, {{and as a result}} were resistant to the aminoglycosides spectinomycin and streptomycin. To ensure that the pKDsg-XXX plasmid was successfully admitted to the cells, the cells were grown on a plate containing both chloramphenicol and spectinomycin to select for cells containing both the pCas9cr4 and pKDsg-XXX plasmids.|$|E
5000|$|Carbon <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression,</b> {{or simply}} <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression,</b> is an {{important}} part of global control system of various bacteria and other micro-organisms. <b>Catabolite</b> <b>repression</b> allows micro-organisms to adapt quickly to a preferred (rapidly metabolisable) carbon and energy source first. This is usually achieved through inhibition of synthesis of enzymes involved in catabolism of carbon sources other than the preferred one. The <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression</b> was first shown to be initiated by glucose and therefore sometimes referred to as the glucose effect. However, the term [...] "glucose effect" [...] is actually a misnomer since other carbon sources are known to induce <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Catabolite</b> <b>repression</b> was {{extensively}} {{studied in}} Escherichia coli. E. coli grows faster on glucose than {{on any other}} carbon source. For example, if E. coli is placed on an agar plate containing only glucose and lactose, the bacteria will use glucose first and lactose second. When glucose {{is available in the}} environment, the synthesis of β-galactosidase is under repression due to the effect of <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression</b> caused by glucose. The <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression</b> in this case is achieved through the utilization of phosphotransferase system.|$|E

5000|$|This {{requirement}} {{reflects the}} greater simplicity with which glucose may be metabolized {{in comparison to}} lactose. The cell [...] "prefers" [...] glucose, and, if it is available, the lac operon is not activated, even when lactose is present. This is an effective way of integrating the two different signals. This phenomenon is known as <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression.</b> CAP {{plays an important role}} in <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression,</b> a well-known example of a modulon and also plays a role in the Mal regulon.|$|E
50|$|Gram {{positive}} bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis have a cAMP-independent <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression</b> mechanism {{controlled by}} catabolite control protein A (CcpA). In this alternative pathway CcpA negatively represses other sugar operons {{so they are}} off {{in the presence of}} glucose. It works by the fact that Hpr is phosphorylated by a specific mechanism, when glucose enters through the cell membrane protein EIIC, and when Hpr is phosphoralated it can then allow CcpA to block transcription of the alternative sugar pathway operons at their respective cre sequence binding sites. Note that E. coli has a similar cAMP-independent <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression</b> mechanism that utilizes a protein called catabolite repressor activator (Cra).|$|E
50|$|The Escherichia coli DcuA and DcuB {{proteins}} {{have very}} different expression patterns. DcuA is constitutively expressed; DcuB is strongly induced anaerobically by FNR and C4-dicarboxylates, while it is repressed by nitrate and subject to CRP-mediated <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression.</b>|$|E
50|$|When a {{microorganism}} {{is provided}} with a rapidly metabolizable carbon-energy source such as glucose, the resulting increase in the intracellular concentration of ATP leads to the repression of enzyme(s) biosynthesis, thus causing a slower metabolization of the energy source. This phenomenon is known as <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression.</b> Many enzymes, especially those involved in catabolic pathways, are subject to this repressive regulation. A powerful method of overcoming the <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression</b> in the enzyme biosynthesis is a fed-batch culture in which glucose concentration in the culture liquid is kept low, where growth is restricted, and the enzyme biosynthesis is derepressed. Slow feeding of glucose in penicillin fermentation by Penicillium chrysogenum is a classical example in the category.|$|E
50|$|Substrate {{limitation}} {{offers the}} possibility to control the reaction rates to avoid technological limitations connected to the cooling of the reactor and oxygen transfer. Substrate limitation also allows the metabolic control, to avoid osmotic effects, <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression</b> and overflow metabolism of side products.|$|E
50|$|CrcZ {{is a small}} RNA {{found in}} Pseudomonas bacteria, which acts as a global {{regulator}} of carbon <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression.</b> In P. aeruginosa, CrcZ is responsible for sequestering the protein Crc. Crc is an RNA-binding global regulator, which acts by inhibiting the translation of the transcriptional regulator AlkS.|$|E
50|$|In P. aeruginosa, CrcZ is a 407-nt long RNA which {{contains}} 5 CA-rich motifs. CrcZ expression is {{regulated by the}} two-component system CbrA/CbrB, {{in response to the}} availability of different carbon sources. As the Crc protein inhibits translation of transcriptional regulators by binding to and occluding the translational initiation site, sequestration of Crc by CrcZ binding means that Crc is unable to inhibit translation and transcriptional regulators, such as AlkS, are freely translated. Expression of CrcZ is dependent on the carbon sources available to the bacteria; in the presence of preferred carbon sources (such as succinate), CrcZ expression is low, and <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression</b> is high. In the presence of poor sources of carbon, such as mannitol, CrcZ expression is high, allowing the inhibition of Crc and a subsequent decrease in <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression</b> occurs.|$|E
50|$|Early in his {{research}} career, Dobrogosz studied metabolic regulation in such species as Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. In particular, {{his research}} focused on the phenomenon of <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression,</b> a regulatory system involving interactions of cyclic AMP, the catabolite repressor protein (CRP) complex, and the lac operon and other inducible systems in bacteria.|$|E
50|$|In {{synthetic}} biology, arabinose {{is often}} used as a one-way or reversible switch for protein expression under the Pbad promoter in E. coli. This on-switch can be negated {{by the presence of}} glucose or reversed off by the addition of glucose in the culture medium which is a form of <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression.</b>|$|E
50|$|The gene {{contains}} an {{open reading frame}} (ORF) of 8,133 nucleotides, coding for 2,710 amino acids. TcdA and TcdB share 63% homology in their amino acid sequences. These genes are expressed during late log phase and stationary phase in response to environmental factors. Environmental stresses such as antibiotics and <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression</b> can influence toxin expression.|$|E
50|$|Aspergillus versicolor {{is able to}} grow on {{a variety}} of surfaces, {{including}} those that are nutrient-deficient, because it is autotrophic for most growth substances and the macronutrient riboflavin. Additionally, A. versicolor has high activity levels of xylanase, an enzyme that breaks down hemicellulose in plant cell walls. Xylanase is a secondary metabolite controlled through gene-specific induction and carbon <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{family also}} {{includes}} several bacterial Myo-inositol catabolism proteins, such as IolB, which is encoded by the inositol operon (iolABCDEFGHIJ) in Bacillus subtilis. IolB {{is involved in}} myo-inositol catabolism. Glucose repression of the iol operon induced by inositol is exerted through <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression</b> mediated by CcpA and the iol induction system mediated by IolR. Members of this family possess a Cupin like structure.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Catabolite</b> <b>repression</b> control (Crc) protein {{participates in}} suppressing {{expression}} of several genes involved in utilization of carbon sources in Pseudomonas bacteria. Presence of organic acids triggers activation of Crc and {{in conjunction with}} the Hfq protein genes that metabolize a given carbon source are downregulated until another more favorable carbon source is depleted. Crc-mediated regulation impact processes such as biofilm formation, virulence [...] and antibiotic susceptibility.|$|E
5000|$|Once the glucose is {{all used}} up, the second {{preferred}} carbon source (i.e. lactose) {{has to be}} used by bacteria. Absence of glucose will [...] "turn off" [...] <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression.</b> When glucose levels are low the phosphorylated form of EIIA accumulates and consequently activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, which will produce high levels of cAMP. cAMP binds to catabolite activator protein (CAP) and together they will bind to a promoter sequence on the lac operon. However, this is not enough for the lactose genes to be transcribed. Lactose must be present inside the cell to remove the lactose repressor from the operator sequence (transcriptional regulation). When these two conditions are satisfied, it means for the bacteria that glucose is absent and lactose is available. Next, bacteria start to transcribe the lac operon and produce β-galactosidase enzymes for lactose metabolism. The example above is a simplification of a complex process. <b>Catabolite</b> <b>repression</b> {{is considered to be a}} part of global control system and therefore it affects more genes rather than just lactose gene transcription.|$|E
50|$|Global {{regulation}} of DNA molecules containing {{the gene for}} sucrose phosphorylase is performed by <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression.</b> First discovered in Gram-negative bacteria, both Cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cAMP Receptor Protein (CRP) function in sucrose phosphorylase regulation (Reid and Abratt 2005). The cAMP-CRP complex formed when both molecules combine acts as a positive regulator for transcription of the sucrose phosphorylase gene. The complex binds to the promoter region to activate transcription, enhancing the creation of sucrose phosphorylase (Nelson and Cox 2005).|$|E

After {{moving from}} Harvard Medical School in 1960, Magasanik {{spent the rest of}} his research career at MIT, including an influential decade {{as the head of the}} Department of Biology from 1967-77. Magasanik's research interests focused on gene regulation, including study of nitrogen metabolic regulation in bacteria, <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression,</b> and intracellular signaling via two-component systems. Magasanik retired in 1990 and died in 2013.|$|E
50|$|With the glucose {{phosphotransferase}} system, the phosphorylation {{status of}} EIIA can have regulatory functions. For example, at low glucose concentrations phosphorylated EIIA accumulates and this activates membrane-bound adenylate cyclase. Intracellular cyclic AMP levels rise and this then activates CAP (catabolite activator protein), which {{is involved in}} the <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression</b> system, also known as glucose effect. When the glucose concentration is high, EIIA is mostly dephosphorylated and this allows it to inhibit adenylate cyclase, glycerol kinase, lactose permease, and maltose permease. Thus, as well as the PEP group translocation system being an efficient way to import substrates into the bacterium, it also links this transport to regulation of other relevant proteins.|$|E
50|$|By adding antimicrobial, e.g. clindamycin, {{into the}} culture growth medium, {{studies have shown}} that the {{cytotoxic}} activity in C. difficile cultures increases by 4-8 fold. Moreover, knowing the role of antibiotics on the causes of PMC, many earlier studies focused on the effects of antimicrobials production of toxins. As a result, studies were able to conclude that the subinhibitory nature of vancomycin and penicillin levels were increasing the toxin production in cultures of C. difficile. The amounts of toxin production were correlated with the usage of growth medium for the organisms. Another study illustrated that the high levels of toxin production of TcdB were observed in complex mediums such as brain and heart infusion broth. High levels of toxins were produced with isolation of highly virulent. Conversely, low levels of toxins were produced with isolation of weakly virulent. Thus, it shows that the productions of toxins were co-regulated. Although the mechanism behind the environment's involvement in modulating the signals expressing the toxins is not understood, in vitro {{studies have shown that}} expression of toxin is strengthened by <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression</b> and stress, e.g. antibiotics. Another study has shown that limiting biotin in well-characterized medium increases the production of TcdB by 64-fold and TcdA by 35-fold. This was done with C. difficile and doses of biotin as small as 0.05nM. Several other early studies have argued against the theory that the production of toxin has anything to deal with stress or <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression</b> of either toxin TcdA or TcdB. Also, many studies say the main reason for the differences among other studies is due to toxin production not occurring with all isolates of C. difficile.|$|E
50|$|The {{promoters}} {{used for}} these vector are usually {{based on the}} promoter of the lac operon or the T7 promoter, and they are normally regulated by the lac operator. These promoters may also be hybrids of different promoters, for example, the Tac-Promoter is a hybrid of trp and lac promoters. Note that most commonly used lac or lac-derived promoters {{are based on the}} lacUV5 mutant which is insensitive to <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression.</b> This mutant allows for expression of protein {{under the control of the}} lac promoter when the growth medium contains glucose since glucose would inhibit gene expression if wild-type lac promoter is used. Presence of glucose nevertheless may still be used to reduce background expression through residual inhibition in some systems.|$|E
50|$|In the Gram-negative {{bacterium}} Escherichia coli (E. coli), {{cell division}} may be partially regulated by AI-2-mediated quorum sensing. This species uses AI-2, which is produced and processed by the lsr operon. Part of it encodes an ABC transporter, which imports AI-2 into the cells {{during the early}} stationary (latent) phase of growth. AI-2 is then phosphorylated by the LsrK kinase, and the newly produced phospho-AI-2 can be either internalized or used to suppress LsrR, a repressor of the lsr operon (thereby activating the operon). Transcription of the lsr operon is also thought to be inhibited by dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) through its competitive binding to LsrR. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate {{has also been shown}} to inhibit the lsr operon through cAMP-CAPK-mediated inhibition. This explains why, when grown with glucose, E. coli will lose the ability to internalize AI-2 (because of <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression).</b> When grown normally, AI-2 presence is transient.|$|E
50|$|Two puzzles of <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression</b> {{relate to}} how cAMP levels are coupled to the {{presence}} of glucose, and secondly, why the cells should even bother. After lactose is cleaved it actually forms glucose and galactose (easily converted to glucose). In metabolic terms, lactose is just as good a carbon and energy source as glucose. The cAMP level is related not to intracellular glucose concentration but to the rate of glucose transport, which influences the activity of adenylate cyclase. (In addition, glucose transport also leads to direct inhibition of the lactose permease.) As to why E. coli works this way, one can only speculate. All enteric bacteria ferment glucose, which suggests they encounter it frequently. It is possible that a small difference in efficiency of transport or metabolism of glucose v. lactose makes it advantageous for cells to regulate the lac operon in this way.|$|E

5000|$|The GalP/H+ symporter is the {{galactose}} permease {{from the}} galP gene of the Eschericha coli genome. Galactose is an alternate carbon source to the preferable glucose [...] The cAMP/CRP <b>catabolite</b> <b>repression</b> regulator {{is most likely}} involved in the regulation of GalP expression (Figure 2) (9). The two proteins responsible for inhibiting transcription from the gal regulon are GalR and GalS (Figure 4) (11). GalR and GalS have very similar primary structure sequences, and have the same binding sites on the operator (11). In the presence of D-galactose, GalR and GalS are inhibited since they are repressors (5, 11). However, when GalP is not required (i.e. when glucose is available), GalR/GalS will bind the promoter operator site thus blocking transcription and preventing cAMP-CRP activation (11). GalS is seen to bind only {{in the presence of}} GalR, so both of these proteins are required for repression (11). cAMP is what modulates CRP at the promoter. The cAMP-CRP complex activates the gal regulon and is responsible for upregulation of GalP (Figure 2) (9,11). GalP is also repressed in the presence of glucose since the cell will prefer glucose over galactose (7).|$|E
