Channel estimation algorithms based on parametric channel modeling require the multipath delays to be estimated at the receiver. The use of a fixed pilot pattern leads to longer training overhead in multipath delay estimation for slow fading <b>channels.</b> However, if <b>hopping</b> pilot patterns are available, then we show that the normalized mean-squared error (NMSE) convergence rate of the channel estimates can be significantly improved. We also show that hopping pilot patterns in OFDM systems effectively allow the eigenvectors of the delay subspace (of the autocorrelation matrix) to be estimated faster. Simulation results are provided to show the faster convergence rate of the NMSE for the hopping pilot pattern over the fixed pilot pattern.

50|$|TSMP, {{an acronym}} for Time Synchronized Mesh Protocol, was {{developed}} by Dust Networks as a communications protocol for self-organizing networks of wireless devices called motes. TSMP devices stay synchronized {{to each other and}} communicate in timeslots, similar to other TDM (time-division multiplexing) systems. Such deterministic communication allows the devices to stay extremely low power, as the radios only turn on for the periods of scheduled communication. The protocol is designed to operate very reliably in a noisy environment. It uses <b>channel</b> <b>hopping</b> to avoid interference -- the packets between TSMP devices get sent on different radio channels depending on time of transmission. Digi International has also developed a time synchronized mesh protocol called DigiMesh.|$|E

The conventional non-regenerative approach is the amplify and forward (A&F) approach, where the signal received at the relay is simply amplified and retransmitted. In this paper, we propose an alternative linear transceiver design for non-regenerative relaying (including pure relaying and the cooperative transmission cases), making proper use of CSI at the relay station. Specifically, we design the optimum linear filtering performed on the data to be forwarded at the relay. As optimization criteria, we have considered the maximization of mutual information (that provides an information rate for which reliable communication is possible) for a given available transmission power at the relay station. Three different levels of CSI can be considered at the relay station: only first <b>hop</b> <b>channel</b> information (between the source and relay); first <b>hop</b> <b>channel</b> and second <b>hop</b> <b>channel</b> (between relay and destination) information, or a third situation where the relay may have complete cooperative channel information including all the links: first and second <b>hop</b> <b>channels</b> and also the direct channel between source and destination.

A vertex in the auxiliary graph is a four-parameter tuple {{of the form}} (node, slot, <b>channel,</b> <b>hop).</b> An edge is formed between two vertices if {{a set of rules}} is satisfied. The rules model the interference and delay constraints. In the second phase, Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm is run to output the delay-constrained schedule while finding a routing path, assigning a channel, and scheduling links in the process. In the third phase, an unfavorable schedule is filtered to incorporate an arbitrary interference graph. The authors compare this algorithm with an offline optimal solution and show that it accepts around 90 % of the calls with respect to the optimal solution.|$|R
