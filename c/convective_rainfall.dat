5000|$|MCCs {{commonly}} develop {{from the}} merging of thunderstorms into a squall line which eventually meet the MCC criteria. Furthermore, some MCC formation can be tracked from the plains in Colorado back to the Rocky Mountains. These are called [...] "orogenic" [...] complexes. The characteristics of the meteorological environment that MCCs form in are strong warm air advection into the formation environment by a southerly low-level jet stream (wind maximum), strong moisture advection which increases the relative humidity of the formation environment, convergence of air near the surface, and divergence of air aloft. These conditions are most prominent in the region ahead of an upper level trough. The systems begin in the afternoon as scattered thunderstorms which organize overnight {{in the presence of}} wind shear (wind speed and direction changes with height). The probability for severe weather is highest {{in the early stages of}} formation, during the afternoon. The MCC persists at its mature and strongest stage overnight and into the early morning in which the rainfall is characterized as stratiform rainfall (rather than <b>convective</b> <b>rainfall</b> which occurs with thunderstorms). Dissipation of the MCC commonly occurs during the morning hours. After dissipation, a remnant mid-level circulation known as a mesoscale convective vortex can initiate another round of thunderstorms later in the day.|$|E

Their efficiency strongly depends on the capacity to predict the structure and frequency of forthcoming rainfall events that under climate change could become particularly local and intensive. For instance, the automated management of sewer systems in Paris region requires robust rainfall information on the timescale of 5 minutes or less. Due to the associated differences in storm water management protocols the discussion of <b>convective</b> vs. stratiform <b>rainfall,</b> which was initially triggered by climatological studies, is widely enlarged by enhanced radar rainfall measurements and hydrologic modeling.

40|$|Convective {{precipitation}} {{associated with}} tropical depression (TD) is one primary type of post-flooding season rainfall in South China (SC). Observations of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite have shown specific diurnal features of <b>convective</b> <b>rainfall</b> in South China, which is somewhat {{different from that}} in other seasons or regions of China. Convective precipitation is usually organized into a rainfall band along the southeastern coast of South China {{in the early morning}} hours. The rainfall band develops and intensifies quickly in the morning, then moves inland in the afternoon and, finally, diminishes at night. The daily <b>convective</b> <b>rainfall</b> along the coast is much more than that in the inland region, and heavy rainfall is often found along the coast. A long-duration heavy rainfall event associated with tropical depression “Fitow” during the period from 28 August to 6 September 2001, is selected in this study to explore the diurnal feature of <b>convective</b> <b>rainfall</b> and its formation mechanism. Modeling results of the 10 -day heavy rainfall event are compared with both rain-gauge observation and satellite-retrieved rainfall. Total precipitation and its spatial distribution, as well as diurnal variations are reasonably simulated and agree well with observations. Further analysis reveals that the development and movement of convective precipitation is mainly related to the land and sea breezes. The anomalous height-latitudinal circulation in the morning-to-noon hours is completely reversed in the afternoon-to-late-evening hours, with the <b>convective</b> <b>rainfall</b> swinging back and forth, following its updraft branch. Sensitivity experiments show that the afternoon <b>convective</b> <b>rainfall</b> in the inland region of SC is caused by the diurnal variation of solar radiation forcing. The mountain range along the coast and the complex topography in the inland region of SC plays a critical role in the enhancement of diurnal <b>convective</b> <b>rainfall</b> everywhere. The formation of a heavy rainfall band along the southeastern coast of SC and the diurnal variation of the rainfall pattern are mainly the results of the land-sea thermal contrast...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} several newly available sources of meteorological data on mesoscale model forecasts of precipitation produced by the extra-tropical cyclone that struck Florida on February 2, 1998. Precipitation distributions of <b>convective</b> <b>rainfall</b> events were derived from Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) and Multi-Channel Passive Microwave Sensor (TMI) microwave radiometric data {{by means of the}} Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) algorithm. Continuous lightning distributions were obtained from sferics measurements obtained from a network of VLF radio receivers. Histograms of coincident sferics frequency distributions were matched to those of precipitation to derive bogus <b>convective</b> <b>rainfall</b> rates from the continuously available sferics measurements. SSM/I and TMI microwave data were used to derive Integrated Precipitable Water (IPW) distributions. The TMI also provided sea surface temperatures (SSTS) of the Loop Current and Gulf Stream with improved structural detail. A series of experiments assimilated IPW and latent heating from the bogus <b>convective</b> <b>rainfall</b> for six-hours in the MM 5 mesoscale forecast model to produce nine-hour forecasts of all rainfall as well as other weather parameters. Although continuously assimilating latent heating only slightly improved the surface pressure distribution forecast, it significantly improved the precipitation forecasts. Correctly locating <b>convective</b> <b>rainfall</b> was found critical for assimilating latent heating in the forecast model, but measurement of the rainfall intensity proved to be less important. The improved SSTs also had a positive impact on rainfall forecasts for this case.

40|$|This study {{describes}} the vertical structure of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) {{that characterized the}} 2004 North American monsoon utilizing observations from a 2875 -MHz (S band) profiler and a dualpolarimetric scanning Doppler radar. Both instrument platforms operated nearly continuously during the North American Monsoon Experiment (NAME). A technique was developed to identify dominant hydrometeor type using S-band (profiler) reflectivity along with temperature. The simplified hydrometeor identification (HID) algorithm matched polarimetric scanning radar fuzzy logic–based HID results quite well. However, the simplified algorithm lacked the ability to identify ice hydrometeors below the melting layer and on occasion, underestimated the vertical extent of graupel because of a profiler reflectivity bias. Three of the strongest NAME <b>convective</b> <b>rainfall</b> events recorded by the profiler are assessed in this study. Stratiform rain exhibited a reflectivity bright band and strong Doppler velocity gradient within the melting layer. <b>Convective</b> <b>rainfall</b> exhibited high reflectivity and Doppler velocities exceeding 3 (210) m s 21 in updrafts (downdrafts). Low-density graupel persisted above the melting layer, often extending to 10 km, with high-density graupel observed near 08 C. Doppler velocity signatures suggested that updrafts and downdrafts were often tilted, though estimating the degree of tilt would have required a more three-dimensional view of the passing storms.

40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{for assessing the}} impact of surface heat fluxes on precipitation is applied to data from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) and to output from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory’s Atmospheric Model 2. 1 (AM 2. 1). The method assesses the sensitivity of afternoon <b>convective</b> <b>rainfall</b> frequency and intensity to the late-morning partitioning of latent and sensible heating, quantified in terms of evaporative fraction (EF). Over North America, both NARR and AM 2. 1 indicate sensitivity of <b>convective</b> <b>rainfall</b> triggering to EF but no appreciable influence of EF on <b>convective</b> <b>rainfall</b> amounts. Functional relationships between the triggering feedback strength (TFS) metric and mean EF demonstrate the occurrence of stronger coupling for mean EF {{in the range of}} 0. 6 to 0. 8. To leading order, AM 2. 1 exhibits spatial distributions and seasonality of the EF impact on triggering resembling those seen in NARR: rainfall probability increases with higher EF over the eastern United States and Mexico and peaks in Northern Hemisphere summer. Over those regions, the impact of EF variability on afternoon rainfall triggering in summer can explain up to 50 % of seasonal rainfall variability. However, the AM 2. 1 metrics also exhibit some features not present in NARR, for example, strong coupling extending northwestward from the central Great Plains into Canada. Sources of disagreement may include model hydroclimatic biases that affect the mean patterns and variability of surface flux partitioning, with EF variability typically much lower in NARR. Finally, the authors also discuss the consistency of their results with other assessments of land–precipitation coupling obtained from different methodologies...|$|E

Water column measurements for this study were collected using airborne expendable probes deployed from NOAA’s WP- 3 D Orion aircraft operated as a part of Dynamics of MJO field experiment conducted during November–December 2011. Purpose of the study is twofold; (1) to provide a statistical analysis of the upper ocean properties observed during different phases of MJO and, (2) to investigate how the upper ocean thermohaline structure evolved in the study region in response to the MJO induced perturbation. During the active phase of MJO, mixed layer depth (MLD) had a characteristic bimodal distribution. Primary and secondary modes were at 34 m and 65 m, respectively. Spatial heterogeneity of the upper ocean response to the MJO forcing was the plausible reason for bimodal distribution. Thermocline and isothermal layer depth deepened, respectively, by 13 and 19 m from the suppressed through the restoring phase of MJO.

In this study we have used the WRF model as a research-practical one with many valuable characteristics and flexibilities. In this research, the effects of heat and moisture fluxes of Caspian Sea on the synoptic and dynamical structure of 20 selective systems associated with heavy rainfall in the southern shores of Caspian Sea are investigated. These systems are selected based on the rainfall data gathered by three local stations named: Rasht, Babolsar and Gorgan in different seasons during a five-year period (2005 - 2010) with maximum amount of rainfall through the 24 hours of a day. In addition to synoptic analyses of these systems, the WRF model with and without surface flues was run using the two nested grids with the horizontal resolutions of 12 and 36 km. The results show that there are good consistencies between the predicted distribution of rainfall field, time of beginning and end of rainfall by the model and the observations. But the model underestimates the amounts of rainfall and the maximum difference with the observation is about 69 %. Also, no significant changes in the results are seen when the domain and the resolution of computations are changed.

Gulf convection also contained reduced precipitationsized ice water mass but proportionally more liquid water mass compared to convection over land.

However, a range of different initial conditions also failed to lead to a well-simulated event, suggesting that some events are unlikely to be predictable with the current observational network, and ensemble guidance for such cases may provide limited additional information useful to a forecaster...|$|R
