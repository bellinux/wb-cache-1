More generally, processes <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away; this effect is known as gravitational time dilation.|$|E

A similar explosive had detonated 50 minutes earlier at King's Cross. The Metropolitan Police had received a three-minute warning and were unable to evacuate the station completely, but British Transport Police evacuated much of the area just before the explosion. In 1974, the mentally ill Judith Ward confessed to the bombing and was convicted of this and other crimes despite the evidence against her being highly suspect and Ward retracting her confessions. She was acquitted in 1992, and the culprit has not been found.|$|E

5|$|In {{quantum field}} theory, one {{typically}} computes the probabilities of various physical events using {{the techniques of}} perturbation theory. Developed by Richard Feynman {{and others in the}} first half of the twentieth century, perturbative quantum field theory uses special diagrams called Feynman diagrams to organize computations. One imagines that these diagrams depict the paths of point-like particles and their interactions. Although this formalism is extremely useful for making predictions, these predictions are only possible when the strength of the interactions, the coupling constant, is small enough to reliably describe the theory as being <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> theory without interactions.|$|E
