Data quality and coverage requirements for definition of oceanographic heat and momentum fluxes, scales of inter- and intra-annual variability, and land-ocean-atmosphere exchange processes were examined. Advantages and disadvantages of earth-based and spaceborne monitoring systems were considered, as were the structures for future monitoring networks, research programs, and modeling studies...|$|E

Some of the LFC's vital statistics and its mounting within the Orbiter payload are described. LFC characteristics and mounting dictate certain mission parameters. The controlling parameters are orbit inclinations, launch time of year, launch time of day, orbital altitude, mission duration, overlap selection, film capacity, and <b>climatological</b> <b>prediction.</b> A mission case is evaluated relative to controlling parameters and geographical area(s) of interest...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. Acoustic propagation in the Somali Basin {{region of the}} Indian Ocean was evaluated using the ICAPS program. Direct path range predictions were made for a towed array (100 Kz) at 100 m and a hull mounted sonar (2000 Hz) at 10 m sensing a signal generated by a source at 100 m. Predictions were based on climatological and recent observed data. These predictions were compared in order to ascertain {{the accuracy of the}} ICAPS <b>climatological</b> <b>prediction.</b> In general, the ICAPS performed marginally well during the summer monsoon season with an average difference of 9 % in predicted ranges at 100 Hz" and 19 % at 2000 Hz for a FOM of 100 or greater. However, predictions based on the winter season climatology were significantly in error with range predictions being over and under predicted by a factor of two. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the Southern Oscillation (SO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is studied by means of forced and secondary forecast models of the PDO. These models are constructed with the same indices frequently associated to {{different aspects of the}} climate of northwestern Baja California, namely the Southern Oscillation Index and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation Index (SOI and PDOI). The secondary forecast model explains about 40 % of the interannual variability of the PDO while the forced model explains about 60 % of PDO interannual plus decadal variability. These results confirm that El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forces the PDO. Thus interannual and decadal variabilities in the Pacific Ocean, and related climatological impacts in northwestern Baja California, may be mainly ENSO-generated. As ENSO forecasts improve, PDO forecast and <b>climatological</b> <b>predictions</b> in this region should also improve...|$|R
40|$|Mean {{net surface}} heating of the Pacific Ocean shows areas of high heat {{gain in the}} eastern tropics and heat loss in the western midlatitudes. For steady state conditions, westward and poleward {{transport}} of heat is implied. Mean geostrophic and Ekman fluxes of heat and freshwater through the sides of a western tropical Pacific box bounded by World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) high-resolution expendable bathythermograph (XBT) transects are presented. Water mass properties of currents transporting heat and freshwater through the enclosed region are seen to be modified in transit. Net transport convergences within the volume of water extending to 800 m in the vertical show a shallow ocean circulation cell (sigma(theta) 3 ̆c 26) with relatively dense subtropical gyre water entering the volume and lighter water leaving in western boundary currents, eastward flowing tropical currents, Ekman flow, and outflow to the Indian ocean. Surface buoyancy fluxes are dominated by freshwater rather than heat fluxes. Freshwater gain through the surface allows warm, salty water to enter in the same density range as cool, fresh water leaving the volume. For steady state conditions the XBT-derived oceanic heat convergence of 0 +/- 0. 3 PW implies negligible heat loss to the atmosphere. Traditional surface heat flux climatologies predict too much heat gain. Part of the discrepancy {{may be due to}} anomolous meteorological conditions during the XBT experiment (1987 - 1995). Oceanic freshwater divergence of 0. 70 +/- 0. 08 Sv falls in the range of <b>climatological</b> <b>predictions</b> from surface freshwater gain...|$|R
40|$|Assimilation Ionosphere Model (AIM) is a physics-based, global, ionospheric {{specification}} {{model that}} is currently under development. It assimilates a diverse set of real-time (or near-real-time) measurements, such as ionograms, GPS slant total electron content (TEC), and in situ plasma measurements. This study focuses on a middle latitude ionosonde assimilation capability in both local and regional forms. The models described are capable of using theƒ 0 F 2 and h m F 2 from ionograms to generate either a local or a regional distribution of the induced plasma drift. This induced drift is usually caused by the meridional neutral wind. Results from a local model (AIM 1. 03 L) and a regional model (AIM 1. 03 R) are presented and compared with the international reference ionosphere (IRI) <b>climatological</b> <b>predictions</b> as well as GPS slant TEC measurements. Results from year-long studies during solar maximum show that {{the accuracy of the}} AIM 1. 03 L model is about a factor of 2 better than that of IRI. An initial month-long regional study is also presented, and the results are almost as good. A study is also carried out using observations taken during the Combined Ionospheric Campaign (CIC) held in November, 1997, in the Caribbean. The digisonde located at Ramey Solar Observatory is used to drive the AIM 1. 03 L model, and the predicted GPS slant TECs are compared to those observed by a GPS receiver located at St. Croix. This study confirms that this first step in preparing a weather-sensitive ionospheric representation is superior to a climatological representation. This sets the stage for the development of full assimilation of GPS TEC, in situ density measurements, etc., and it is anticipated that the AIM 1. 03 L-R ionospheric representation will provide an accurate ionospheric specification...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study evaluates {{performance}} of Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) prediction in the Beijing Climate Center Atmospheric General Circulation Model (BCC_AGCM 2. 2). By using the real-time multivariate MJO (RMM) indices, it is {{shown that the}} MJO prediction skill of BCC_AGCM 2. 2 extends to about 16 – 17 days before the bivariate anomaly correlation coefficient drops to 0. 5 and the root-mean-square error increases {{to the level of}} the <b>climatological</b> <b>prediction.</b> The prediction skill showed a seasonal dependence, with the highest skill occurring in boreal autumn, and a phase dependence with higher skill for predictions initiated from phases 2 – 4. The results of the MJO predictability analysis showed that the upper bounds of the prediction skill can be extended to 26 days by using a single-member estimate, and to 42 days by using the ensemble-mean estimate, which also exhibited an initial amplitude and phase dependence. The observed relationship between the MJO and the North Atlantic Oscillation was accurately reproduced by BCC_AGCM 2. 2 for most initial phases of the MJO, accompanied with the Rossby wave trains in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics driven by MJO convection forcing. Overall, BCC_AGCM 2. 2 displayed a significant ability to predict the MJO and its teleconnections without interacting with the ocean, which provided a useful tool for fully extracting the predictability source of subseasonal prediction...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{important aspects}} in model development {{and evaluation of}} nonlinear non-parametric data-driven hydrological and <b>climatological</b> <b>prediction</b> models. Limitations and caveats of data-driven algorithms are discussed using two test cases. A static neural network is developed to forecast the runoff of a meso-scale, partly glaciated, alpine catchment area in the southernmost Andes in Patagonia. With an example of snowcover prediction in the Black Forest mountain range issues of stability and error propagation of dynamical neural networks are discussed. Results are evaluated and compared to simple linear methods. Such algorithms are extremely efficient even if knowledge of underlying processes is missing. Since no phenomenological meaning can be assigned to internal model parameters {{it is difficult to}} make causal inferences on the predictors. To overcome this issue we propose to estimate different sources of uncertainty in the model input by a global sensitivity analysis. This approach captures the interaction effects in the predictor set which is in particular an important characteristic of nonlinear systems. Based on this knowledge irrelevant predictors can be pruned, thus effectively reducing the number of predictors for more parsimonious models. Further a novel predictor optimization algorithm for precipitation downscaling which allows for nonlinearities in the screening process is presented. The algorithm optimizes both, the predictors and their corresponding domains by self-organizing maps and a simulated annealing algorithm. Due to the nonlinear screening data-driven algorithms significantly improve the ability to capture complex spatio-temporal structures...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} {{cluster is}} a group of interconnected computers. They work as a single supercomputer that can run simulations and operations that require big computational calculations. A computer cluster has several applications from <b>climatological</b> <b>predictions</b> and astrological applications to molecular simulations. On the other hand, the Raspberry Pi 2 is a computer with the size of a credit card but with a high performance. At the Escola Tècnica i Superior d’Enginyeria Industrial de Barcelona (Spain) was born the idea of building a small computer cluster for small research centres and universities by using a hundred Raspberry Pi 2 boards: The E-Nanocluster. The E-Nanocluster requires a series of projects that delve into different branches of the engineering science. This particular project is the first one and it focus on the heat extraction and the structure design of the cluster. The structure of this document follows all the steps that bring the cluster from a simple idea to a real solution. First there is a presentation of the main characteristics of the computer clusters and the Raspberry Pi 2 boards and then is analysed {{the state of the art}} of the actual heat extraction systems in computers. Once the best system is chosen, it is provided a basic design for the cluster. From that design is developed an adaptable thermal and fluidic model made with Microsoft Office Spreadsheet. This model calculates in just a few seconds which is the fan power required for the correct heat extraction. All the parameters such as the air temperature, heat sink characteristics or the power generated can be modified. With this model it is done a sensibility analysis for optimizing the solution by minimizing the cost and the space of the machine. After that, it has been done a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulation to verify the model. The CFD program used has been SolidWorks Flow Simulation. Finally, there is an analysis of the environmental impact, the budget of the project and a plan for the next projects that should be done for bringing the E-Nanocluster to life...|$|R
40|$|Urbanization {{produces}} higher air {{temperatures in}} cities {{than in the}} undeveloped rural surroundings. This phenomenon {{is known as the}} Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect and has been measured in different cities around the world. Conventional building energy programs use standard meteorological databases obtained from measurements at operational weather stations, which are usually located in open areas outside of the city, typically at the airport. Therefore, air temperature measurements may not include the UHI effect. The UHI effect can {{have an impact on the}} energy consumption of buildings, especially residential and naturally ventilated buildings. At the same time, the energy performance of buildings can affect outdoor air temperatures, mainly through the waste heat emissions from outdoor air-conditioning equipment. Consequently, there are situations in which the interactions between the indoor and outdoor environments are reciprocal and thus both domains have to be solved simultaneously. This thesis presents a study of the energy interactions between buildings and the urban climate through the development and evaluation of a set of models. Based on first principles, these models include three different Urban Canopy and Building Energy Models (UC-BEMs), with different levels of detail and applications, and a novel urban climate prediction tool, the Urban Weather Generator (UWG). Developed at the intersection of building energy and urban climate studies, the research builds on fundamental knowledge in both domains. The UC-BEMs account for building thermal effects on <b>climatological</b> <b>predictions</b> and have the potential to predict building energy consumption at urban scale. The UC-BEMs can be coupled with mesoscale atmospheric simulations, establishing a multi-scale model approach from the atmosphere down to buildings that can be used to analyze the impact of future climate change scenarios on the urban climate and the energy consumption of buildings. The UWG calculates site-specific urban climate conditions from measurements at an operational weather station. The model can be used alone or integrated into existing programs in order to account for the UHI effect in building energy simulations. The UWG is evaluated with field data from Toulouse, France, and Basel, Switzerland. by Bruno Bueno Unzeta. Thesis (Ph.

40|$|Abstract. Regional {{phenology}} {{is important}} in ecosystem simulation models and coupled biosphere/atmosphere models. In the continental United States, {{the timing of the}} onset of greenness in the spring (leaf expansion, grass green-up) and offset of greenness in the fall (leaf abscission, cessation of height growth, grass brown-oft) are strongly influenced by meteorological and climatological conditions. We developed predictive phenology models based on traditional phenology research using commonly available meteorological and <b>climatological</b> data. <b>Predictions</b> were compared with satellite phenology observations at numerous 20 km x 20 km contiguous landcover sites. Onset mean absolute error was 7. 2 days in the deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF) biome and 6. 1 days in the grassland biome. Offset mean absolute error was 5. 3 days in the DBF biome and 6. 3 days in the grassland biome. Maximum expected errors at a 95 % probability level ranged from 10 to 14 days. Onset was strongly associated with temperature summations in both grassland and DBF biomes; DBF offset was best predicted with a photoperiod function, while grassland offset required a combination of precipitation and temperature controls. A long-term regional test of the DBF onset model captured field-measured interannual variability trends in lila...|$|R
40|$|An {{assessment}} {{is made of}} the ability of current theory to explain the phenomenology of upper atmospheric ozone as revealed by the sizeable body of measurements presently available. The chemical processes affecting the vertical distribution of ozone are reviewed, and simple analytical expressions for the ozone concentrations at different altitudes are derived which approximate the key elements of the ozone chemistry. These equations provide simple explanations of the sensitivity of model computations to the choice of rate constants and climatological patterns. Model calculations are compared with a detailed measurement of an ozone profile, and the model is modified to assess the variation in ozone expected to result from perturbations in key <b>climatological</b> processes. These <b>predictions</b> are then compared with the variability observed in midlatitude measurements in order to verify the model description of ozone processes in the upper atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|A {{conceptual}} framework is presented for a unified treatment of issues arising {{in a variety}} of predictability studies. The predictive power (PP), a predictability measure based on information–theoretical principles, lies {{at the center of this}} framework. The PP is invariant under linear coordinate transformations and applies to multivariate predictions irrespective of assumptions about the probability distribution of prediction errors. For univariate Gaussian predictions, the PP reduces to conventional predictability measures that are based upon the ratio of the rms error of a model prediction over the rms error of the <b>climatological</b> mean <b>prediction.</b> Since climatic variability on intraseasonal to interdecadal timescales follows an approximately Gaussian distribution, the emphasis of this paper is on multivariate Gaussian random variables. Predictable and unpredictable components of multivariate Gaussian systems can be distinguished by predictable component analysis, a procedure derived from discriminant analysis: seeking components with large PP leads to an eigenvalue problem, whose solution yields uncorrelated components that are ordered by PP from largest to smallest. In a discussion of the application of the PP and the predictable component analysis in different types of predictability studies, studies are considered that use either ensemble integrations of numerical models or autoregressive models fitted to observed or simulated data. An investigation of simulated multidecadal variability of the North Atlantic illustrates the proposed methodology. Reanalyzing an ensemble of integrations of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory coupled general circulation model confirms and refines earlier findings. With an autoregressive model fitted to a single integration of the same model, it is demonstrated that similar conclusions can be reached without resorting to computationally costly ensemble integrations. 1...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{relationships}} between yield and soil properties and topographic characteristics is of critical importance in precision agriculture. A necessary {{first step is to}} identify techniques to reliably quantify {{the relationships}} between soil and topographic characteristics and crop yield. Stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), projection pursuit regression (PPR), and several types of supervised feed–forward neural networks were investigated in an attempt to identify methods able to relate soil properties and grain yields on a point–by–point basis within ten individual site–years. To avoid overfitting, evaluations were based on predictive ability using a 5 –fold cross–validation technique. The neural techniques consistently outperformed both SMLR and PPR and provided minimal prediction errors in every site–year. However, in site–years with relatively fewer observations and in site–years where a single, overriding factor was not apparent, the improvements achieved by neural networks over both SMLR and PPR were small. A second phase of the experiment involved estimation of crop yield across multiple site–years by including climatological data. The ten site–years of data were appended with <b>climatological</b> variables, and <b>prediction</b> errors were computed. The results showed that significant overfitting had occurred and indicated that a much larger number of climatologically unique site–years would be required in this type of analysis...|$|R
40|$|The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), jointly {{sponsored}} by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of United States and the National Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan, provides visible, infrared, and microwave observations of tropical and subtropical rain system. The satellite observations are complemented by ground radar and rain gauge measurements to validate satellite rain estimation techniques. TRMM satellite was launched on November 27, 1997 (EST). Data from TRMM are being archived, processed, and disseminated by DAAC at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) of NASA. The Goddard DAAC has been archiving Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) data since the launch. The TRMM level 1 and level 2 products first have been released to public on June 15, 1998. Now, most of TRMM products, including some ground validation products are released to public.

40|$|The Galerkin {{truncated}} inviscid Burgers equation {{has recently}} been shown by the authors to be a simple model with many degrees of freedom, with many statistical properties similar to those occurring in dynamical systems relevant to the atmosphere. These properties include long time-correlated, large-scale modes of low frequency variability and short time-correlated “weather modes” at smaller scales. The correlation scaling in the model extends over several decades and {{may be explained by}} a simple theory. Here a thorough analysis of the nature of predictability in the idealized system is developed by using a theoretical framework developed by R. K. This analysis is based on a relative entropy functional that has been shown elsewhere by one of the authors to measure the utility of statistical predictions precisely. The analysis is facilitated by the fact that most relevant probability distributions are approximately Gaussian if the initial conditions are assumed to be so. Rather surprisingly this holds for both the equilibrium (<b>climatological)</b> and nonequilibrium (<b>prediction)</b> distributions. We find that in most cases the absolute difference in the first moments of these two distributions (the “signal” component) is the main determinant of predictive utility variations. Contrary to conventional belief in the ensemble prediction area, the dispersion of prediction ensembles is generally of secondary importance in accounting for variations in utility associated with different initial conditions. This conclusion has potentially important implications for practical weather prediction, where traditionally most attention has focused on dispersion and its variability...|$|R
