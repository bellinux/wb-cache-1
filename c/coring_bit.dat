50|$|The Heart-Shaped Tub: The Trap - The contestants must {{install a}} trap {{as part of}} the tub installation. Two drains must be {{installed}} for the tub: one for the main drain and another for the overflow, and both must connect to only one trap, which must be installed in the hotel's basement and connected to the hotel's existing system. Due to there only being two drills available for all the contestants, only Dan and Charlene have first access to the drills; Ajay, denied a drill by Natasha, instead grabs a jackhammer and uses the <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> to cut a hole through the concrete floor, damaging both the floor and the bit, and cutting a hole too big for his drain pipe. Furthermore, he attaches his pipes to the tub before installing his drains in the basement, and he places his trap too far away from his drains (by Ontario's codes, the trap may only be at most 60 cm from his drain). On top of all that, his pipes leak when tested. Needless to say, he fails. Matt originally misinterprets his notes from the lesson taught by Geoff (who will also test the traps by pouring a bucket of water into the drain pipes), but he eventually finishes his connection. However, beyond the trap his connection to the hotel's existing system runs uphill, so he fails. Neither Dan nor Rob encounter any issues in installing their drains to an acceptable quality, and both pass. Charlene runs out of time, and fails.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Impregnated diamond <b>core</b> <b>bits</b> {{are often}} used in core {{drilling}} for geological surveys. A tri-state theory is proposed to describe the three states in drilling processes for a diamond particle or a bit. These states are contacting state, cutting state, and ploughing state. Furthermore, the relations among thrust and other mechanical parameters are also summarized. The optimal value of the specific energy is in the cutting state. Several experiment results verified the proposed model. This mechanism is useful for selecting operation parameters in core drilling using impregnated diamond <b>core</b> <b>bits...</b>|$|R
40|$|High-frequency/low-frequency {{drilling}} is {{an attractive}} technology for planetary exploration tools, and one which has seen considerable innovation in the techniques used to ensure rotation of the front-end cutting bit. This rotation is essential to prevent tooth imprintation in hard materials, and extracting the rotation from the high-frequency or ultrasonic system has obvious benefits in terms of simplicity and robustness. However, extracting the rotation from an ultrasonic horn raises the possibility of bit-walk if {{it is used to}} operate a coring device and the authors therefore propose an ultrasonic horn which uses an excitation applied to a single input surface to yield torsional and longitudinal vibration on two physically separated output surfaces. By engaging with the two output surfaces, longitudinal vibration can be extracted to achieve initial percussive drilling, even where a <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> is applied, and the torsional output can subsequently be added to prevent tooth imprintation once the <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> has settled into the site in question. In this manner, the horn provides a mechanism whereby high-frequency/low-frequency drilling technique can be applied to coring operations without the need for an exceptionally robust drill structure capable of resisting bit-walk forces...|$|E
40|$|This device takes {{advantage}} of the centrifugal forces that are generated when a <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> is rotated, and a granular sample is entered into the bit while it is spinning, making it adhere to the internal wall of the bit, where it compacts itself into the wall of the bit. The bit can be specially designed to increase the effectiveness of regolith capturing while turning and penetrating the subsurface. The bit teeth can be oriented such that they direct the regolith toward the bit axis during the rotation of the bit. The bit can be designed with an internal flute that directs the regolith upward inside the bit. The use of both the teeth and flute can be implemented in the same bit. The bit can also be designed with an internal spiral into which the various particles wedge. In another implementation, the bit can be designed to collect regolith primarily from a specific depth. For that implementation, the bit can be designed such that when turning one way, the teeth guide the regolith outward of the bit and when turning in the opposite direction, the teeth will guide the regolith inward into the bit internal section. This mechanism can be implemented with or without an internal flute. The device is based on the use of a spinning <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> (hollow interior) as a means of retaining granular sample, and the acquisition is done by inserting the bit into the subsurface of a regolith, soil, or powder. To demonstrate the concept, a commercial drill and a <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> were used. The bit was turned and inserted into the soil that was contained in a bucket. While spinning the bit (at speeds of 600 to 700 RPM), the drill was lifted and the soil was retained inside the bit. To prove this point, the drill was turned horizontally, and the acquired soil was still inside the bit. The basic theory behind the process of retaining unconsolidated mass that can be acquired by the centrifugal forces of the bit is determined by noting that in order to stay inside the interior of the bit, the frictional force must be greater than the weight of the sample. The bit can be designed with an internal sleeve to serve as a container for granular samples. This tube-shaped component can be extracted upon completion of the sampling, and the bottom can be capped by placing the bit onto a corklike component. Then, upon removal of the internal tube, the top section can be sealed. The novel features of this device are: center dot A mechanism of acquiring and retaining granular samples using a <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> without a closed door. center dot An acquisition bit that has internal structure such as a waffle pattern for compartmentalizing or helical internal flute to propel the sample inside the bit and help in acquiring and retaining granular samples. center dot A bit with an internal spiral into which the various particles wedge. center dot A design that provides a method of testing frictional properties of the granular samples and potentially segregating particles based on size and density. A controlled acceleration or deceleration may be used to drop the least-frictional particles or to eventually shear the unconsolidated material near the bit center...|$|E

40|$|Based on an {{optimized}} lunar regolith <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> (LRCB) configuration, {{the load}} characteristics of rotary-percussive drilling of lunar rock simulant {{in a laboratory}} environment are analyzed {{to determine the effects}} of the drilling parameters (the rotational velocity, the penetration rate, and the percussion frequency) on the drilling load. The process of rotary drilling into lunar rock using an LRCB is modeled as an interaction between an elemental blade and the rock. The rock’s fracture mechanism during different stages of the percussive mechanism is analyzed to create a load forecasting model for the cutting and percussive fracturing of rock using an elemental blade. Finally, a model of the load on the LRCB is obtained from the analytic equation for the bit’s cutting blade distribution; experimental verification of the rotary-impact load characteristics for lunar rock simulant with different parameters is performed. The results show that the penetrations per revolution (PPR) are the primary parameter influencing the drilling load. When the PPR are fixed, increasing the percussion frequency reduces the drilling load on the rock. Additionally, the variation pattern of the drilling load of the bit is in agreement with that predicted by the theoretical model. This provides a research basis for subsequent optimization of the drilling procedure and online recognition of the drilling process...|$|E

Three earlier cruises to Hole 1256 D (ODP 206, IODP 309 / 312) have drilled through the sediments, lavas, and dikes and 100 m into a complex dike-gabbro transition zone. Operations on IODP Expedition 335 proved challenging throughout, with almost three weeks spent re-opening and securing unstable sections of the hole.

Proven techniques to sample Mars subsurface will be critical for future NASA astrobiology missions that will search for records of past and present life on the planet, as well as, the search for water and other resources. A deep corer, called Auto-Gopher, is currently being developed as a joint effort of the JPL's NDEAA laboratory and Honeybee Robotics Corp. The Auto-Gopher is a wire-line rotary-hammer drill that combines rock breaking by hammering using an ultrasonic actuator and cuttings removal by rotating a fluted bit. The hammering mechanism is based on the Ultrasonic/Sonic Drill/Corer (USDC) that has been developed as an adaptable tool for many of drilling and coring applications. The USDC uses an intermediate free-flying mass to transform the high frequency vibrations of the horn tip into a sonic hammering of a drill bit. The USDC concept was used in a previous task to develop an Ultrasonic/Sonic Ice Gopher. The lessons learned from testing the ice gopher were implemented into the design of the Auto-Gopher by inducing a rotary motion onto the fluted <b>coring</b> <b>bit.</b> A wire-line version of such a system would allow penetration of significant depth without a large increase in mass.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} current questions in space science is whether life has ever arisen {{anywhere else in the}} universe. Water is a critical prerequisite for all life-as-we-know-it, thus the possible exploration targets for extraterrestrial life are bodies that have or had copious liquid: Mars, Europa, and Enceladus. Due to the oxidizing nature of Mars' surface, as well as subsurface liquid water reservoirs present on Europa and Enceladus, the search for evidence of existing life must likely focus on subsurface locations, at depths sufficient to support liquid water or retain biologic signatures. To address these questions, an Auto-Gopher sampler has been developed that is a wireline type drill. This drill is suspended on a tether and its motors and mechanisms are built into a tube that ends with a <b>coring</b> <b>bit.</b> The tether provides the mechanical connection to a rover/lander on a surface as well as power and data communication. Upon penetrating to a target depth, the drill is retracted from the borehole, the core is deposited into a sample transfer system, and the drill is lowered back into the hole. Wireline operation sidesteps one of the major drawbacks of traditional continuous drill string systems by obviating the need for multiple drill sections, which add significantly to the mass and the complexity of the system (i. e. penetration rate was 40 cm per hour). Drilling to 2 meter depth and recovering of cores every 10 cm took a total time of 15 hours (a single step of drilling 10 cm and retrieving the core was 45 minutes). Total energy to reach the 2 m depth was 500 Whr. The Weight on Bit was limited to less than 70 Newton. The core recovery was 100 %...|$|E

Robert Longyear (E.J.’s son) became president of the firm in 1924, preserving the chain of family ownership and management that would continue for another 40 years. In 1929, Longyear sold almost US$1.5 million worth of drilling equipment to other drillers. The following year the company formed its first foreign subsidiary in Canada. The company also signed its first contract for work in Africa, sending equipment and a crew to provide drilling for copper ores. However, the stock market crash of October 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression reduced earnings to $79,000 in 1933. During the 1930s, Longyear took on a project drilling for core samples for the proposed Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. In spite of the financial crisis, the 1930s saw improvements in diamond drilling technology, including the use of industrial-quality diamonds mined in Africa that were called “boarts.” In 1936, South Africa’s Anglo American Corporation formed Boart Products South Africa (Pty) Limited, which was later named Boart International.

The Atromos probe was designed with the intent of investigating this polar region for evidence of life and to take atmospheric data in the harsh environment. The overall project was done as an example model and proof of concept for a small and affordable planetary probe capable of collecting scientific data used in life detection. Several key instruments were included such as a mass spectrometer, methane detector, gas chromatograph, and atmospheric characterization equipment. Some important components of the design were the ultra sonic drill, mechanical airbag system and deployable mast. The ultra sonic drill consists of a piezoelectric vibrator attached to a <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> and a free mass. This drill can operate without external force applied and can bring back ice cores on the polar surface. The mechanical airbag system is an alternative method for touchdown in the EDL sequence. It minimizes the complexity and increases reliability of the probe surviving impact by utilizing spokes to absorb the impact. The deployable mast is used to enhance the atmospheric data collection by extending a series of temperature, pressure and anemometers to various distances above the surface. Notable subsystem work includes the power system and thermal regulation for operation on the planet. The power system consists of a radioisotope thermoelectric generator as well as solar panels that surround the probe. Power is stored in ultra capacitors and the probe operates on duty cycles when enough power is stored. The thermal regulation system consists of a sealed insulated box concealed within the probe. Inside the box are several radioisotope heating units to provide the warmth necessary for polar survival.

Some data from these experiments have been reported (Cozzi and Duncan 2010). In this study, leaching experiments were conducted with a single core sample under conditions that are representative of saltstone performance. In separate experiments, reducing and oxidizing environments were targeted to obtain solubility and Kd values from the measurable species identified in the solid and aqueous leachate. This {{study was designed to}} provide insight into how readily species immobilized in saltstone will leach from the saltstone under oxidizing conditions simulating the edge of a saltstone monolith and under reducing conditions, targeting conditions within the saltstone monolith. Core samples were taken from saltstone poured in December of 2007 giving a cure time of nine months in the cell and a total of thirty months before leaching experiments began in June 2010. The saltstone from Vault 4, Cell E is comprised of blast furnace slag, class F fly ash, portland cement, and Deliquification, Dissolution, and Adjustment (DDA) Batch 2 salt solution. The salt solution was previously analyzed from a sample of Tank 50 salt solution and characterized in the 4 QCY 07 Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC) report (Zeigler and Bibler 2009). Subsequent to Tank 50 analysis, additional solution was added to the tank solution from the Effluent Treatment Project as well as from inleakage from Tank 50 pump bearings (Cozzi and Duncan 2010).

40|$|IODP Expedition 335 "Superfast Spreading Rate Crust 4 " {{returned}} to ODP Hole 1256 D {{with the intent}} of deepening this reference penetration of intact ocean crust several hundred meters into cumulate gabbros. This was the fourth cruise of the superfast campaign to understand the formation of oceanic crust accreted at fast spreading ridges, by exploiting the inverse relationship between spreading rate and the depth to low velocity zones seismically imaged at active mid-ocean zones, thought to be magma chambers. Site 1256 is located on 15 -million-year-old crust formed at the East Pacific Rise during an episode of superfast ocean spreading (> 200 mm/yr full rate). Three earlier cruises to Hole 1256 D have drilled through the sediments, lavas and dikes and 100 m into a complex dike-gabbro transition zone. The specific objectives of IODP Expedition 335 were to: (1) test models of magmatic accretion at fast spreading ocean ridges; (2) quantify the vigor of hydrothermal cooling of the lower crust; (3) establish the geological meaning of the seismic Layer 2 - 3 boundary at Site 1256; and (4) estimate the contribution of lower crustal gabbros to marine magnetic anomalies. It was anticipated that even a shortened IODP Expedition could deepen Hole 1256 D a significant distance (300 m) into cumulate gabbros. Operations on IODP Expedition 335 proved challenging from the outset with almost three weeks spent re-opening and securing unstable sections of the Hole. When coring commenced, the destruction of a hard-formation C 9 rotary <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> {{at the bottom of the}} hole required further remedial operations to remove junk and huge volumes of accumulated drill cuttings. Hole-cleaning operations using junk baskets returned large samples of a contact-metamorphic aureole between the sheeted dikes and a major heat source below. These large (up to 3. 5 kg) irregular samples preserve magmatic, hydrothermal and structural relationships hitherto unseen because of the narrow diameter of drill core and previous poor core recovery. Including the ~ 60 m-thick zone of granoblastic dikes overlying the uppermost gabbro, the dike-gabbro transition zone at Site 1256 is over 170 m thick, of which more than 100 m are recrystallized granoblastic basalts. This zone records a dynamically evolving thermal boundary layer between the principally hydrothermal domain of the upper crust and a deeper zone of intrusive magmatism. The recovered samples document a sequence of evolving geological conditions and the intimate coupling between temporally and spatially intercalated intrusive, hydrothermal, contact-metamorphic, partial melting and retrogressive processes. Despite the operational challenges, we achieved a minor depth advance to 1522 m, but this was insufficient penetration to complete any of the primary objectives. However, Hole 1256 D has been thoroughly cleared of junk and drill cuttings that have hampered operations during this and previous Expeditions.

The expedition aimed to deepen this basement reference site several hundred meters into the gabbroic rocks of intact lower oceanic crust to address the following fundamental scientific questions: Does the lower crust form by subsidence of a crystal mush from a high-level magma chamber (gabbro glacier), by intrusion of sills throughout the lower crust, or by some other mechanism? How does melt percolate through the lower crust, and what are the reactions and chemical evolution of magmas during migration? Is the plutonic crust cooled by conduction or hydrothermal circulation? What are the role and extent of deeply penetrating seawater-derived hydrothermal fluids in cooling the lower crust and the chemical exchanges between the ocean crust and the oceans? What are the relationships among the geological, geochemical, and geophysical structure of the crust and, in particular, the nature of the seismic Layer 2 – 3 transition? What is the magnetic contribution of the lower crust to marine magnetic anomalies? Hole 1256 D is located on 15 Ma crust in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean (6 ° 44. 163 ?N, 91 ° 56. 061 ?W). Oceanic crust that formed at a superfast spreading rate (> 200 mm/y) was specifically targeted to exploit the observed relationship between spreading rate and depth to axial low-velocity zones, thought to be magma chambers, seismically imaged at active mid-ocean ridges. This was a deliberate strategy to reduce the drilling distance to gabbroic rocks because thick sequences of lavas and dikes have proved difficult to penetrate in the past. Previous cruises to ODP Site 1256 (ODP Leg 206; IODP Expedition 309 / 312) have achieved their leg- and expedition-specific objectives but not the overarching strategic goals of the Superfast Spreading Crust campaign to understand magmatic accretion at fast-spreading ocean ridges. However, the three previous cruises achieved the first complete sampling of intact upper oceanic crust and successfully drilled through ~ 800 m of erupted lavas and thin (~ 345 m) sheeted dike complex and sampled gabbros at ~ 1157 meters subbasement. The lowermost 100 m of the hole is a complex dike–plutonic transition zone and comprises two gabbro lenses intruded into very strongly contact metamorphosed, granoblastically recrystallized sheeted dikes. During Expedition 335, we reentered Hole 1256 D more than 5 years after our last visit and encountered and overcame a number of significant engineering challenges, each unique but of natures not unexpected in a deep, uncased marine borehole into igneous rocks. The patient, persistent efforts of the rig floor teams cleared a major obstruction at 920 meters below seafloor (mbsf) that initially prevented reentry into the hole to its full depth (1507 mbsf). The 920 – 960 mbsf interval was then cemented to stabilize the borehole wall. A short phase of coring deepened Hole 1256 D ~ 13 m before the C- 9 hard formation <b>coring</b> <b>bit</b> failed and was ground to a smooth stump. A progressive, logical course of action was then undertaken to clear the bottom of the hole of metal junk from the failed <b>coring</b> <b>bit,</b> open up a short interval of undergauge hole, and remove a very large amount of drilling cuttings from the hole. This was successfully completed, and the hole is open to its full depth (1521. 6 mbsf). The hole-cleaning phase was followed by wireline caliper and temperature measurements of the complete hole to assist with cementing operations to stabilize the lowermost 10 m of the hole and the problematic interval at 910 – 940 mbsf. These remedial efforts should facilitate reentry and coring on a future return to Hole 1256 D. In addition to the few cores drilled, the junk baskets deployed during the successive fishing runs {{to the bottom of the}} hole recovered a unique collection of samples, including large cobbles (as large as 5 kg), angular rubble, and fine cuttings of principally strongly to completely recrystallized granoblastic basalt with minor gabbroic rocks and evolved plutonic rocks. The large blocks exhibit intrusive, structural, and textural relationships, along with overprinting and crosscutting hydrothermal alteration and metamorphic paragenetic sequences that hitherto have not been observed because of the small diameter of drill cores and the very low recovery of the granoblastic dikes cored so far. The high extent of metamorphic recrystallization exhibited by the granoblastic basalt, combined with operational factors, provides strong evidence that most of this material comes from the lowermost reaches of Hole 1256 D (~ 1495 to ~ 1522 mbsf). Including the ~ 60 m thick zone of granoblastic dikes that reside above the uppermost gabbros, the dike–gabbro transition zone at Site 1256 is > 170 m thick, of which > 100 m is recrystallized granoblastic basalt. When the textural and contact relationships exhibited by these samples are placed in the geological context of the Hole 1256 D stratigraphy, a vision emerges of a complex, dynamic thermal boundary layer zone. This region of the crust between the principally hydrothermal domain of the upper crust and the intrusive magmatic domain of the lower crust is one of evolving geological conditions. An intimate coupling among temporally and spatially intercalated magmatic, hydrothermal, partial melting, intrusive, metamorphic, and retrograde processes is recorded in the recovered samples. Expedition 335 left Hole 1256 D after making only a very modest advance, and we have yet to recover the samples of cumulate gabbros required to test models of ocean ridge magmatic accretion and the intensity of hydrothermal cooling at depth. However, a remarkable sample suite of granoblastic basalt with minor gabbros, some of which intrude previously recrystallized dikes, was recovered and provides a detailed picture of a rarely sampled critical interval of the oceanic crust. Most importantly, the hole has been stabilized, cleared to its full depth, and is ready for deepening in the near future...|$|E
40|$|This work is {{a method}} to drill into a rock surface {{regardless}} of the gravitational field or orientation. The required weight-on-bit (WOB) is supplied by a self-contained anchoring mechanism. The system includes a rotary percussive coring drill, forming a complete sampling instrument usable by robot or human. This method of in situ sample acquisition using micro - spine anchoring technology enables several NASA mission concepts not currently possible with existing technology, including sampling from consolidated rock on asteroids, providing a bolt network for astronauts visiting a near-Earth asteroid, and sampling from the ceilings or vertical walls of lava tubes and cliff faces on Mars. One {{of the most fundamental}} parameters of drilling is the WOB; essentially, the load applied to the bit that allows it to cut, creating a reaction force normal to the surface. In every drilling application, there is a minimum WOB that must be maintained for the system to function properly. In microgravity (asteroids and comets), even a small WOB could not be supported conventionally by the weight of the robot or astronaut. An anchoring mechanism would be needed to resist the reactions, or the robot or astronaut would push themselves off the surface and into space. The ability of the system to anchor itself to a surface creates potential applications that reach beyond use in low gravity. The use of these anchoring mechanisms as end effectors on climbing robots has the potential of vastly expanding the scope of what is considered accessible terrain. Further, because the drill is supported by its own anchor rather than by a robotic arm, the workspace is not constrained by the reach of such an arm. Yet, if the drill is on a robotic arm, it has the benefit of not reflecting the forces of drilling back to the arm s joints. Combining the drill with the anchoring feet will create a highly mobile, highly stable, and highly reliable system. The drilling system s anchor uses hundreds of microspine toes that independently find holes and ledges on a rock to create an anchor. Once the system is anchored, a linear translation mechanism moves the drill axially into the surface while maintaining the proper WOB. The linear translation mechanism is composed of a ball screw and stepper motor that can translate a carriage with high precision and applied load. The carriage slides along rails using self-aligning linear bearings that correct any axial misalignment caused by bending and torsion. The carriage then compresses a series of springs that simultaneously transmit the load to the drill along the bit axis and act as a suspension that compensates for the vibration caused by percussive drilling. The drill is a compacted, modified version of an off-the-shelf rotary percussive drill, which uses a custom carbide-tipped <b>coring</b> <b>bit.</b> By using rotary percussive drilling, the drill time is greatly reduced. The percussive action fractures the rock debris, which is removed during rotation. The final result is a 0. 75 -in. (. 1. 9 - cm) diameter hole and a preserved 0. 5 - in. (. 1. 3 -cm) diameter rock core. This work extends microspine technology, making it applicable to astronaut missions to asteroids and a host of robotic sampling concepts. At the time of this reporting, it is the first instrument to be demonstrated using microspine anchors, and is the first self-contained drill/anchor system to be demonstrated that is capable of drilling in inverted configurations and would be capable of drilling in microgravity...|$|E
