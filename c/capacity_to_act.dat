5|$|Undeterred, Bruce {{was elected}} Chairman {{of the newly}} formed FAO Council in November 1947, working once more with John Boyd Orr, now Secretary-General of the FAO. Acute {{shortages}} of cereals and livestock were rampant following severe droughts in Europe, and the international food supply system was under serious strain after the devastation of the war. Bruce and the council worked in these years to distribute fertiliser and agricultural machinery, as well as improve nutrition, especially in less developed nations. More {{than two-thirds of the}} world was undernourished in 1949 and Bruce felt it imperative for the Council to bring these stark facts to the developed nations. A landmark agreement on technical aid between the FAO and the United Nations was reached in November 1949, and the FAO received the funding and logistical <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> on the food shortage crisis and the problems of poor nutrition in the developing world. Bruce and the FAO were successful in these years in supporting the recovery of world agricultural output. By 1951 this had exceeded pre-war levels, and general levels of nutrition were rising internationally, but by the time Bruce stepped down in that year neither had improved fast enough {{to keep pace with the}} post-war population boom. The Council faced major obstacles in supporting the improvement of conditions in the developing world as governments there began diverting resources to arms programs as independence, post-colonial and Cold War conflicts multiplied. Frustrated by continuing world conflict and the lack of commitment from the developed world to support the lofty but very difficult aims of the FAO, both Bruce and Orr resigned from the FAO disappointed by its modest gains and insufficient powers to alleviate world food problems.|$|E

In administering the armed forces, the Ministry for National Defence is organized into four principal sections and the inspectorate general: Section I deals with legal and legislative matters; Section II handles personnel and recruitment matters, including discipline and grievances; Section III is concerned with troop command, schools, and other facilities, and it also comprises departments G-1 through G-5 as well as a separate department for air operations; and Section IV deals with procurement and supply, quartermaster matters, armaments, and ordnance (see fig. 12).|$|E

60|$|At some period, however, {{of their}} history, almost every people, now civilized, have consisted, in majority, of slaves. A {{people in that}} {{condition}} require to raise them out of it a very different polity from a nation of savages. If they are energetic by nature, and especially if there be associated with them in. the same community an industrious class who are neither slaves nor slave-owners (as {{was the case in}} Greece), they need, probably, no more to insure their improvement than to make them free: when freed, they may often be fit, like Roman freedmen, to be admitted at once to the full rights of citizenship. This, however, is not the normal condition of slavery, and is generally a sign that it is becoming obsolete. A slave, properly so called, is a being who has not learned to help himself. He is, no doubt, one step in advance of a savage. He has not the first lesson of political society still to acquire. He has learned to obey. But what he obeys is only a direct command. It is the characteristic of born slaves to be incapable of conforming their conduct to a rule or law. They can only do what they are ordered, and only when they are ordered to do it. If a man whom they fear is standing over them and threatening them with punishment, they obey; but when his back is turned, the work remains undone. The motive determining them must appeal, not to their interests, but to their instincts; immediate hope or immediate terror. A despotism, which may tame the savage, will, in so far as it is a despotism, only confirm the slaves in their incapacities. Yet a government under their own control would be entirely unmanageable by them. Their improvement can not come from themselves, but must be superinduced from without. The step which they have to take, and their only path to improvement, is to be raised from a government of will to one of law. They have to be taught self-government, and this, in its initial stage, means the <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> on general instructions. What they require is not a government of force, but one of guidance. Being, however, in too low a state to yield to the guidance of any but those to whom they look up as the possessors of force, the sort of government fittest for them is one which possesses force, but seldom uses it; a parental despotism or aristocracy, resembling the St. Simonian form of Socialism; maintaining a general superintendence over all the operations of society, so as to keep before each the sense of a present force sufficient to compel his obedience to the rule laid down, but which, owing to the impossibility of descending to regulate all the minutiæ of industry and life, necessarily leaves and induces individuals to do much of themselves. This, which may be termed the government of leading-strings, seems to be the one required to carry such a people the most rapidly through the next necessary step in social progress. Such appears to have been the idea of the government of the Incas of Peru, and such was that of the Jesuits of Paraguay. I need scarcely remark that leading-strings are only admissible as a means of gradually training the people to walk alone.|$|E
40|$|Among the {{competency}} standards stipulated by the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Council for graduating {{students are}} competencies in {{moral and ethical}} decision making and ethics education within professions such as nursing has traditionally focussed on these competencies, on raising ethical awareness and developing skills of analysis and reasoning. However, ethics education in tertiary settings places less emphasis on developing students’ <b>capacities</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> on their values. This paper explains and explores the adoption of Dr. Mary Gentile 2 ̆ 7 s curriculum (the Giving Voice to Values curriculum) which specifically focuses on developing students’ <b>capacities</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> on their values. The curriculum (Gentile, 2010) assists students and professionals to explore, script and rehearse responses which build upon their <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> respond {{in accordance with their}} own values in complex workplace settings in which they face conflicts of value and belief. The paper firstly examines the theoretical underpinnings of the Giving Voice to Values (GVV) curriculum. It then presents the integration and evaluation phase of a Project inspired by the GVV methodology, using a case study approach within two areas of an undergraduate nursing curriculum. As a pilot project, this initiative has provided signposts to further curriculum development and to research pathways within the UNDA School of Nursing, by highlighting students’ uncertainties regarding their own professional values, and their intense struggles to voice their values within health care contexts...|$|R

40|$|Deontic Doxastic Constitutivism is {{the view}} that beliefs are constitutively governed by deontic norms.

My aim in this article is to provide an objection to such a conception of the normativity of belief. I argue that if some deontic norm is constitutive of belief, then the addressees of such a norm are committed to a potentially infinite number of norms. Furthermore, if addressees are in the position to fulfill all such norms, they must also be able to hold a potentially infinite number of logically independent beliefs.

40|$|We {{argue that}} hope {{is not an}} {{expectancy}} based on beliefs about pathways to desired goals and personal <b>capacities</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> on them, but an experience of the mere possibility of a desired outcome. We propose that in the latter sense, hope has unique motivational consequences for goal striving. Specifically, we predicted that hope buffers against the detrimental impact of negative feedback on goal-progress. The results of the two studies confirmed this prediction. In Study 1, we measured participants’ hopes of attaining a weight-loss goal. In Study 2, we induced hope at solving an unsolvable mathematical puzzle. In both studies, receiving negative feedback on goal-progress resulted in lower levels of success (Study 1) and persistence (Study 2) in goal-striving, but not for participants who experienced hope. We discuss the role of hope as an affective mechanism that functions to regulate energy expenditure in goal-striving...|$|R

40|$|Wisdom is not {{an innate}} {{character}} trait; no one automatically is wise; wisdom is learned and acquired. More importantly, one can learn and acquire wisdom intentionally and skillfully — one can practice it. And, if the practice is structured in particular ways, the practice will improve one’s <b>capacities</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> with wisdom. This article clarifies theoretical muddiness and pedagogical imprecision by bringing together two important and robust strands of legal ethics literature. The first strand focuses on what the appropriate role of a lawyer is in a just society, while the second focuses on how a lawyer learns to be, or is formed into, a professional. Neither strand regularly considers the other. By putting the two strands into conversation, we demonstrate that a lawyer can learn to be wise, but that such wisdom must be situated within a normative end goal. The idea of practical wisdom {{has its roots in}} Aristotelian traditions. Much of the discourse about practical wisdom has focused on it as a desired end state. While that is an important inquiry, it misses a key question — how does one become practically wise. Our article offers a new answer. It describes a set of processes and <b>capacities</b> <b>to</b> develop practical wisdom — what the authors call “practicing practical wisdom. ...|$|R

This compendium of papers delivered at the Involving Children and Young People in Research Think Tank seeks to do just that. The Think Tank, co-hosted by the Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth (ARACY) and the New South Wales (NSW) Commission for Children and Young People was held on 11 November 2008. It was organised to bring together researchers and policy makers from many disciplines and sectors to discuss the nature of the experience of participatory research with children and young people. The dual focus of the day was to discuss considerations and issues — both positive and negative — that have featured in this research, and to identify ways of moving forward with these issues in the future. This compendium is supported by a literature review (Appendix 2) which examines the ethical and methodological contexts in which research conversations have begun around the world in relation <b>to</b> children’s <b>capacities</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as protagonists in their own lives...|$|R

Building upon the critical, creative hacker ethos of technological engagement, and the collective practice of the hackathon, the techno-cultural workshops is directed at humanities researchers and social and cultural theorists. We conceptually frame this method via Simondon as a practice-led opportunity to rethink the contested relationship between the human, nature and technology, with a view to challenging social and cultural theory that ignores the human reality of the technical object. We outline an exemplar techno-cultural workshop which explored mobile apps as i) an opportunity to use new digital tools for empirical research, and ii) as technical objects and elements for better understanding their social and cultural dimensions. We see political efficacy in the techno-cultural method not only in augmenting critical and creative agency, but as a practical exploration of the concept of data technicity, an inexhaustible relationality that exceeds the normative and regulatory utility of the data we generate and can be linked anew into collective <b>capacities</b> <b>to</b> <b>act...</b>|$|R

However, this development is accompanied by a process of growing institutional and procedural differentiation and complexity of the EU system.
