He served as the backup quarterback behind Steve Spurrier his rookie season, and saw playing time in eight games, including one start against the Miami Dolphins. His season ended after suffering an injury {{in a game against}} the Cleveland Browns. He recovered from the injury and tried to make the team in 1977, but was cut, ending his career. After retiring, he became a high school offensive <b>coordinator</b> <b>in</b> Tampa.|$|E
5|$|Bud Carson was Tech's {{defensive}} <b>coordinator</b> <b>in</b> 1966. His job was {{to appease}} the massive Tech fan base Bobby Dodd had accumulated. Carson was not the charismatic leader like Dodd but rather a strategy man that enjoyed intense game planning. Carson's most notable achievements included recruiting Tech's first ever African American scholarship athlete and being the first Tech head coach to be fired.|$|E

5|$|Broccoli and Hunt {{eventually}} chose Lazenby {{after seeing}} {{him in a}} Fry's Chocolate Cream advertisement. Lazenby dressed the part by sporting several sartorial Bond elements such as a Rolex Submariner wristwatch and a Savile Row suit (ordered for, but uncollected, by Connery), and going to Connery's barber at the Dorchester Hotel. Broccoli noticed Lazenby as a Bond-type man based on his physique and character elements, and offered him an audition. The position was consolidated when Lazenby accidentally punched a professional wrestler, who was acting as stunt <b>coordinator,</b> <b>in</b> the face, impressing Broccoli with his ability to display aggression. Lazenby was offered a contract for seven films; however, he was convinced by his agent Ronan O'Rahilly that the secret agent would be archaic in the liberated 1970s, {{and as a result}} he left the series after the release of On Her Majesty's Secret Service in 1969.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} year, {{the defense was}} ranked second overall in the NFL and second in rushing yards allowed. By his second year, in 2000, the Ravens' defense set NFL records for fewest points allowed and fewest rushing yards allowed. The defense allowed a {{combined}} 23 points in four playoff games {{en route to a}} Super Bowl XXXV victory, Ryan's only Super Bowl ring, over the New York Giants. The defense consistently performed well in the following years. As a result, Ryan was promoted to defensive <b>coordinator</b> <b>in</b> 2005 following the departure of Mike Nolan, who became the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers. In 2006, Ryan received Assistant Coach of the Year awards from Pro Football Weekly and the Pro Football Writers Association.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of their achievements {{during the regular season}} and during the 2000 Sugar Bowl, multiple players and coaches from each team earned awards and recognition after the conclusion of the game. Tech quarterback Michael Vick, despite leading the losing team in the Sugar Bowl, won an ESPY for college football player of the year on February 14, more than a month after the Sugar Bowl. In addition, Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer won multiple coach of the year awards, most notably the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award, which was presented to Beamer on March 6. One of Beamer's assistant coaches, Bud Foster, was named the top defensive <b>coordinator</b> <b>in</b> Division I-A football by American Football Coach Magazine in its annual award. Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke won the 2000 Heisman Trophy after the conclusion of the 2000 college football season.|$|E
40|$|The role {{of cancer}} <b>coordinators</b> <b>in</b> cancer care {{collaboration}} in Norwegian municipalities Uncoordinated services represent a pronounced challenge in Norwegian health care. To enhance local cancer care, a trial project implementing cancer <b>coordinator</b> positions <b>in</b> several Norwegian municipalities {{was launched in}} 2012. We aim to assess the role cancer <b>coordinators</b> play <b>in</b> the local coordination of cancer care. In 2014, 52 % of cancer <b>coordinators</b> <b>in</b> Norwegian municipalities answered a quantitative web survey concerning their role. Cancer coordinators work directly with patients and their families, but are also a resource for other service providers. Collaboration with involved parties is generally adequate, although interactions with general practitioners, NAV, schools and kindergartens could be improved. Cancer prevalence will increase due to population aging, and thus pressure municipal health services. Cancer coordinators report that they contribute positively in local cancer care. Future research should include perspectives also from patients, next-of-kin and collaborating partners, and potential differences in municipalities with and without cancer coordinators should be explored...|$|R

5|$|Plagued by hearing problems, the 64-year-old coach {{announced}} his retirement {{before the end of}} the 1970 season, which the Browns finished with a 7–7 record. Collier told Modell that he could no longer hear his players, and it was difficult to read their lips through new face masks that obscured their mouths. Modell tried to help by getting Collier to try new hearing aids and even sent him for acupuncture treatment, but none of it worked. Collier struggled during press conferences because he often could not hear what reporters were asking and answered the wrong questions. In eight years as coach, Collier led Cleveland to a championship and a 76–34–2 record. Nick Skorich, who came to the Browns as offensive <b>coordinator</b> <b>in</b> 1964, was named as his replacement in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Vitarelli's {{personal}} views often {{put him at}} odds with the US government. He personally wanted to help the Palauans become self-sufficient, but the TTPI wanted to focus on improving Micronesia–United States relations. Nevertheless, he established community schools that replaced the Japanese three Rs educational model with Deweyism. In 1962, the TTPI assigned Vitarelli as an architect and project <b>coordinator</b> <b>in</b> the Accelerated Elementary School Program (AESP), a project costing over one million dollars. He wanted to have local Palauans to build schools and houses under this program. The TTPI rejected these plans, insisting that the locals could not meet the project's physical specifications. As a result of this conflict, the TTPI transferred Vitarelli to its headquarters in Saipan. While on Saipan, Vitarelli used local bayogo seeds to create the Bo Jo Bo Wishing Doll for an upcoming arts festival. These traditional-style dolls are still sold on Saipan today.|$|E
5|$|Plagued by hearing problems, the 64-year-old Collier {{announced}} his retirement {{before the end of}} the 1970 season. In eight years as coach, Collier led Cleveland to a championship and a 74–33–2 record. Nick Skorich was named as his replacement the following year. Skorich came to the Browns as offensive <b>coordinator</b> <b>in</b> 1964, when the team won the championship. In Cleveland's first year under Skorich, the team improved to 9–5 but lost to the Colts in a divisional playoff. Mike Phipps was promoted to starting quarterback over Nelsen before the 1972 season. After a sluggish start, the Browns went on tear and finished with a 10–4 record. That put Cleveland in a playoff against the undefeated Miami Dolphins. The Browns took a lead in the fourth quarter on a touchdown catch by wide receiver Fair Hooker, but the Dolphins responded with a long drive of their own, aided by a pair of Paul Warfield receptions. Running back Jim Kiick ran for a touchdown, sealing a 20–14 win and preserving the Dolphins' perfect season. The following year, Phipps threw 20 interceptions and completed less than half of his passes. After winning four of the first six games, the Browns slumped and placed third in the division with a 7–5–2 record.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 1990s, Daisy Jugadai was {{a regular}} {{exhibitor}} at the Araluen Art Centre in Alice Springs, and well as other major exhibitions such as the Australian Heritage Art Awards in Canberra in 1994. Recognition came in 1993, in two forms: an award of a Northern Territory Women's Fellowship; and the purchase by the Araluen Arts Centre of a work exhibited in its annual art award. Within her community she was an administrator {{as well as an}} artist. A member of the Ikuntji Women's Centre and a representative on Ikuntji Community Council, Daisy {{was one of those who}} successfully lobbied to have artist Marina Strocchi appointed as an art centre <b>coordinator</b> <b>in</b> the early 1990s. The respect between the two women was mutual: Daisy was one of a group of artists whose work was selected for an exhibition that toured regional Australian public galleries in 1999–2000, Ikuntji tjuta – touring, which was curated by Marina Strocchi, the art centre coordinator who had first helped develop the Ikuntji centre in Haasts Bluff some years earlier.|$|E
5|$|With the {{departure}} of Connery after You Only Live Twice, Broccoli and director Peter R. Hunt chose Australian George Lazenby {{to play the role}} of Bond. He first came to their attention after seeing him in a Fry's Chocolate Cream advertisement. Lazenby dressed the part by sporting several sartorial Bond elements such as a Rolex Submariner wristwatch and a Savile Row suit (ordered, but uncollected, by Connery), and going to Connery's barber at the Dorchester Hotel. Lazenby consolidated his claim during a screen test, when he accidentally punched a professional wrestler, who was acting as stunt <b>coordinator,</b> <b>in</b> the face, impressing Broccoli with his ability to display aggression. Lazenby never signed a contract, with negotiations dragging on during production, and he was subsequently convinced by his agent Ronan O'Rahilly that the secret agent would be archaic in the liberated 1970s; as a result he left the role before the release of On Her Majesty's Secret Service in 1969. For his performance as Bond, Lazenby was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor at the 27th Golden Globe Awards.|$|E
