40|$|Background and Aim: Chlorhexidine is a {{mouthwash}} {{with known}} antibacterial effect but its antifungal effect is not clear. The {{aim of this}} study was to compare the antimicrobial effects of nystatin and chlorhexidine mouthwashes (one Iranian product and the other, commercial) on Candida albicans under in vitro condition. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, the strains of Candida albicans used consisted of one standard strain (PTCC 5027) and ten local isolates. The latter were obtained from patients referred to different dental clinics in Kerman city. The specimens were taken from the gum and palate area by sterile swabs and dipped into Stewards transport medium, transferred to the laboratory within one hour, and cultured on Sabauraud dextrose Agar. Colonies showing the characteristic appearance of Candida were further cultured and routine differential tests including germ tube formation were performed to confirm the diagnosis of C. albicans. These were used to prepare a microbial cell suspension of 0. 5 Mc Farland concentration. Each cell suspension was inoculated over duplicate plates of SDA and 4 wells of 5 mm diameter were made using sterile <b>cork</b> <b>borers.</b> Each previously coded mouthwash was placed in corresponding well and incubated for 24 - 48 hours and the diameter of inhibition zone was measured with ruler. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each mouthwash for each isolate of Candida albicans was determined using dilution tube technique. Data were analyzed by SPSS package using proper statistical tests with P< 0. 05 as the limit of significance. Results: There was a significant difference between the antimicrobial effects of the four tested mouthwashes. The results indicated that Iranian nystatin mouthwash had the greatest effect and the average inhibition zone from the highest to the lowest was associated with Iranian nystatin, foreign nystatin, Iranian chlorhexidine and foreign chlorhexidine respectively. The MIC determination revealed that generally nystatin was more effective than chlorhexidine. No statistical difference was seen between the Iranian and foreign samples. Conclusions: Despite the antifungal effects of chlorhexidine, more investigations on different strains of C. albicans is required before recommending its cilinical application...|$|R

50|$|In 1988, Robert Paterek and Paul Smith {{were searching}} for methanogenic {{bacteria}} in the Great Salt Lake in Utah when they first discovered the archaeon Methanohalophilus mahii in its anoxic sediments. Sediment samples were collected and stored in plexiglas tubes, and sub-core samples taken with a brass <b>cork</b> <b>borer</b> and transferred to fifty milliliter serum bottles. All samples were processed within forty-eight hours of collection. The media used for isolation of Methanohalophilus mahii colonies was prepared using the Hungate technique for proper isolation of anaerobic microbes. Serial dilutions were prepared in a 1:10 ratio, and agar roll tubes were inoculated and incubated at 30oC for eight weeks. Isolated methanogenic colonies were chosen by identifying those with a foamy texture, denoting gas release, and repeatedly diluted and inoculated on agar roll tubes until only one type of colony morphology remained. These colonies appeared as cream to pale yellow-colored circular-shaped colonies with an overall foamy texture due to gas release.|$|E
30|$|Agar well {{diffusion}} {{was done}} by using the modified agar well diffusion method described by Nair and Chando (2005). A sterile 8 -mm <b>cork</b> <b>borer</b> was used. The prepared nutrient agar plates were rubbed with the test organisms using sterile swab sticks. The sterile 8 -mm <b>cork</b> <b>borer</b> was used to bore a hole on the agar film in the Petri dish and filled {{with each of the}} different extract prepared. This was then transferred to the incubator at 37 [*]°C for 24 [*]h. Antibiotics (norfloxacin (NOR), ciprofloxacin (CIP), levofloxacin (LEV), gentamicin (CN), vancomycin (VA), and nitrofurantoin (F)) were used as control. In the case of A. flavus, a spore suspension (106 spores/ml) was prepared and 100 [*]μl of it was spread on potato dextrose agar (PDA) dishes. After absorption, the <b>cork</b> <b>borer</b> was used to bore. The dishes were incubated for 5 days at 25 [*]°C. Visible inhibition zone around bore was used (Freire et al. 2011).|$|E
30|$|The {{isolation}} technique used by Onyike and Maduewesi [15] was employed in this study. A small {{section of the}} yam or cocoyam tissue showing advancing margin of rot and adjoining healthy tissue were cut using sterilized scalpel and <b>cork</b> <b>borer</b> whose surface was sterilized with 70 % ethanol. The peeled portions of the yam or cocoyam obtained with the <b>cork</b> <b>borer</b> {{were placed on the}} solidified agar. Three peeled portions were placed per plate with equal distance between them. Three replicate plates for each of the rotten portion of site were made for each yam or cocoyam variety. The plates were incubated at 27 [*]±[*] 2  °C for 7  days. Fungi associated with the yam or cocoyam rot affected tissues were observed and the frequency of isolation determined using method of Okigbo and Ikediugwu [16]. Subculturing was done to obtain pure cultures of the isolates.|$|E
30|$|All glass wares used in {{this study}} were washed with detergent, rinsed and sterilized in a dry, {{ventilated}} oven at 160  °C for 2  h.

The scalpel, <b>cork</b> <b>borer</b> and inoculating needle were sterilized by dipping them into 70 % ethanol and passing them over a Bunsen burner flame until red hot.|$|E
30|$|The {{lengths of}} the tagged leaves were {{measured}} thrice by inserting the stick abaxially. Six weeks later, leaves were harvested. To estimate SLA, six leaf discs (3.4  cm 2) per individual condition were collected with a <b>cork</b> <b>borer.</b> The leaf’s midveins were avoided to reduce variations. The discs were dried to constant mass at 80  °C, and then weighed. Dry weight (DW) {{was used to}} calculate the SLA, the ratio of leaf area to DW. The measurements were carried out from February to March 2013.|$|E

The organisms were grown in a freshly prepared potato dextrose agar plate. After {{the growth of the}} organisms, mycelia plugs were obtained with <b>cork</b> <b>borer</b> under ultraviolet lamp under the wavelength of 300  nm at about 0.3  m. Five mycelia plugs were withdrawn during a 30 -min interval (Adetunji and Oloke 2013).|$|E
30|$|The {{antibacterial}} {{activity of the}} nanocomposite was analyzed against Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae using agar well diffusion method (Malibari 1991; Zhou et al. 2006; Gong and Guo 2009; Zhang et al. 2009). The nanocomposite was taken at different concentrations (50  µg, 100  µg, 200  µg and 500  µg/well). Bacillus subtilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae are inoculated in nutrient agar plates. The wells were made in plates with a <b>cork</b> <b>borer.</b> The plates were incubated for 24  h at 37  °C. The formation of inhibition zone around the well was measured.|$|E
30|$|Antimicrobial {{activity}} assays {{were carried}} out using an agar well diffusion method [16]. A sterile swab was moistened with fresh bacterial suspension and spread on a solid, sterile Muller-Hinton agar plate. Wells {{were made in the}} agar plate using a <b>cork</b> <b>borer.</b> Different concentrations (25, 50, 75, and 100  μL) of synthesized nanoparticle suspension were poured into each consecutive well. All plates were incubated at 37  °C for 24  h. A zone of inhibition was measured (mm) around each well in every incubated plate. For each experiment, three replicates were performed [17].|$|E
30|$|CPHE-AgNPs’ {{antibacterial}} properties against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia obtained from LAUTECH Teaching Hospital, Ogbomoso were investigated using agar diffusion method as previously described [5, 10, 23, 24]. The culture broth was obtained through overnight growth in peptone water {{and this was}} used to seed the freshly prepared plates of Mueller–Hinton Agar (Lab M Ltd., UK). Thereafter, plates were bored {{with the aid of}} <b>cork</b> <b>borer,</b> and 100  μl of the graded concentrations of CPHE-AgNPs was introduced into the wells. This was subsequently followed by incubation at 37  °C for 24  h, after which zones of inhibition were measured.|$|E
30|$|The fungal {{toxicity}} of untreated and treated dye {{was determined by}} agar-well diffusion method. Potato dextrose agar (PDA) (Himedia, Mumbai, India) plates were swabbed (sterile cotton swabs) with 0.1 OD fungal cultures. Using the sterile <b>cork</b> <b>borer,</b> wells (6  mm) were made into each petriplate. 10  µl of untreated dye and treated dye were introduced into separate wells and distilled water served as control. Then, the plates were incubated {{at room temperature for}} 48 – 72  h (Rani et al. 2014). After the incubation period, the diameter of the inhibition zones of each well was measured and the values were tabulated.|$|E
30|$|Agar well {{diffusion}} method {{described by}} Cheesbrough (2000) and was adopted {{for assessing the}} inhibitory zone displayed by the formulated toothpastes. Briefly, the indicator microorganisms were sub cultured into nutrient broth and malt extract broth. The test tubes containing bacteria were incubated at 37  °C for 24  h, while tube with yeast was incubated at 28  °C for 48  h. Thereafter, inoculum size was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland turbidity standards. A sterile cotton swab was aseptically used to transfer organism on the dried surface of sterile Mueller Hinton Agar plate. Sterile <b>cork</b> <b>borer</b> was used to make well of 7  mm.|$|E
30|$|In the turgor {{pressure}} measurement, the coarse bark firstly was slightly scraped with a blunt knife. Then, using a special micro <b>cork</b> <b>borer,</b> {{a small hole}} of approximately 2 - 3  mm in depth was punctured down to the hard wood of the bark to ensure the whole phloem was penetrated and measured. The <b>cork</b> <b>borer</b> was made from a hypodermic injection needle (14 #) with the tip removed and modified (Hammel 1968). The borer can bring bark debris out when it removes out to {{lower the risk of}} system blockage without damaging the xylem. Following the withdrawing of the borer, the micropipette tip of the PTPP was immediately inserted tightly into the hole. The latex will flow out rapidly from many severed laticifers into the PTPP system and pressurize the silicon oil inside it. The pressure inside the PTPP was recorded with a pressure transducer (26 PCFA 6 D, Honeywell, Germany) and a data logger (92101 Sensor-interface, Burster, Germany) to monitor the pressure change. During the measurement, the pressure inside the system can be changed while the latex exudation from the wounded laticifers was slowed, stopped or reversed by adjusting the micrometer screw {{at the end of the}} probe. The reliability of the measured {{turgor pressure}} could also be confirmed by a relaxation (suction) drop and a subsequently quick recovery of the pressure by adjusting the micrometer screw because the H. brasiliensis laticifer is a big reservoir of latex.|$|E
30|$|The {{pathogenicity}} {{test was}} carried out to establish which of the fungal isolates caused the rot and {{to determine whether they}} could induce similar symptoms on inoculation and be re-isolated, thus fulfilling Koch’s postulates. The method of Okafor [22], Okigbo and Ikediugwu [16] were adopted for the pathogenicity study. The pure fungal isolates obtained from infected yam tubers of Discorea rotundata and Cocoyam corm of Colocasia esculenta variety, respectively, for the period of the collection were used for inoculation. Healthy yam tubers (D. rotundata variety) and Cocoyam corm (C. esculenta variety) were surface-sterilized with 70 % ethanol. Each healthy tuber was bored into about 1  cm deep, with a sterile 6  mm diameter <b>cork</b> <b>borer</b> at three different points on the yam and cocoyam surface (proximal, middle and distal regions). Another 6  mm sterile <b>cork</b> <b>borer</b> was used to cut about 5  mm of mycelia disc from edge of a 5  days old culture of each fungus isolate. The mycelia discs were used to inoculate the holes created by scooping out the plant tissue. The scooped out tissue of the yam and cocoyam were replaced after 5  mm pieces had been cut off to compensate for the thickness of the fungal culture. Two whole tubers of yam and two whole corm of cocoyam were inoculated per fungus. The control set-up consists of tubers that were similarly bored into and inoculated with sterilized PDA agar discs.|$|E
30|$|The {{bacterial}} {{toxicity of}} untreated and treated dye {{was determined by}} agar-well diffusion method. Mueller-Hinton agar (MH) (Himedia, Mumbai, India) plates were swabbed (sterile cotton swabs) with 0.1 OD cultures of gram-positive (three cultures) and gram-negative (seven cultures) bacteria. Using the sterile <b>cork</b> <b>borer,</b> wells (6  mm) were made into each petriplate. 10  µl of untreated dye and treated dye were introduced into separate wells and distilled water served as control. Then, the plates were incubated at 37  °C for 24  h (Kahraman and Yalcin 2005). After the incubation period, {{the diameter of the}} inhibition zones of each well was measured and the values were tabulated.|$|E
30|$|In this assay, 2  % (w/v) CMC was {{dissolved}} in citrate buffers (pH 7) and supplemented with 1.5  % agar for solidification. After sterilization, {{equal amounts of}} assay medium (20  mL) were poured in sterilized petri dishes (12  cm in diameter). Cups (10  mm in diameter) were made in each plate using a sterile <b>cork</b> <b>borer.</b> Equal amounts of the enzyme solution (cultural supernatant) were put into each cup. Plates with cups containing enzyme solutions were incubated at 37  °C for 24  h, then {{the surface of the}} plates was floated with iodine ZnCl 2 solution. Diameters of blue zones were measured. The mean values of three readings were calculated.|$|E
30|$|The gel {{diffusion}} {{method was}} used for anti-fungal and bacterial studies. Nutrient broth and potato dextrose broth were affixed with actively growing 100  ml of culture and then allowed it to solidify. Afterwards that, making a well {{with the help of}} <b>cork</b> <b>borer.</b> 100  ml of aliquots of 5  mg/ml dispersed doped and undoped ZnO was inoculated into the well and allowed it to incubate for 48  h incubation period at 300  °C. A zone of clearance around the well was observed for further studies. The diameter against the microbes was determined for all microbes in a similar manner. Average values ensure the reliability of the result.|$|E
30|$|The {{antibacterial}} {{activity of the}} extracts was determined by agar well diffusion technique. 20  ml of nutrient agar media was transferred into petriplates and they were left undisturbed for 1 - 2  h. Bacterial culture (0.5  μl) was transferred into petriplates using cotton stick and evenly spread {{with the help of}} sterile bent glass rod. Cups was made in Petri plates using sterile <b>cork</b> <b>borer</b> having diameter of 6  mm and each formulation was added into well. Then bacterial plates were incubated at 37  °C 24  h [13]. Antibacterial activity was determined by measuring the zone of inhibition around each well using zone reader [14]. Measured inhibition zones were recorded as mean diameter in mm.|$|E
30|$|Fungal strains (Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were inoculated {{into the}} broth under aseptic {{condition}} and incubated at 35  °C for 18  h. After the incubation period, the fungi were swabbed on the agar plate using a sterile cotton swab. Each fungus was swabbed separately and each plate {{was divided into}} six parts. Wells (6  mm) were made on Muller Hinton Agar plate using a sterile <b>cork</b> <b>borer</b> under aseptic condition. The AgNPs (600  µg/ 20  µl) biosynthesized using 6 different plant extracts (AKG, SKG, PGKG, PAKG, PGG, and KFG) and Fluconazole (control) were loaded onto the marked wells using a micropipette and incubated at 37  °C for 24  h. The zones of inhibition produced were recorded in millimeter.|$|E
30|$|Actively growing fungal plant Sclerotinia sp. {{pathogens}} were aseptically transformed on to {{midpoint of}} sterile standard potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates and incubated at 25  °C for 2  days.

After 2 -month incubation at 23  °C, each colony was removed from the cellophane membrane, weighed, wrapped in dry weight-known aluminum foil, and dried at 70  °C for 3  days in an electric oven. Dried foil-wrapped colonies were cooled in a desiccator and weighed. Colony dry weight was calculated by subtracting dry weight of aluminum foil from that of foil-wrapped colony.|$|E
30|$|The {{bacterial}} suspension with the turbidity comparable to 0.5 McFarland was transferred {{onto the surface}} of Lowenstein-Jensen plate using sterile cotton swab. RIF-loaded SLNs and aqueous solutions of RIF with concentration of 220 μg/ml were prepared, then serial dilutions were made from the stock. Diameter wells (8 mm) were bored on the medium with a <b>cork</b> <b>borer,</b> and 100 μl aliquots of each diluted sample were introduced into each well. As control group, 100 μl of drug-free SLNs were delivered into 3 wells. After 48 -h incubation at 37 °C, the growth of bacteria around the wells was evaluated, and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of RIF-SLNs and RIF aqueous solution were determined as the lowest concentration that could inhibit bacterial growth around the well.|$|E
30|$|From the {{periphery}} of 7  day old cultures of thermotolerant isolates, mycelial discs were taken out by a <b>cork</b> <b>borer</b> (5  mm diameter) and placed {{at the center of}} the PDA plates in two replicates.
