25|$|In 1963 Novak {{teamed up}} with Rowland Evans, a former <b>Congressional</b> <b>correspondent</b> for the New York Herald Tribune, to create the Inside Report, a {{newspaper}} column published four times a week. It was also known as Inside Washington. Evans did not know Novak at all except through his reputation when they started. They each had a contrasting public image, with Novak dressing sloppy and Evans' appearing like a diplomat with a refined manner. Their column mixed standard reporting with their own editorial opinions. It began with muted, mostly centrist views, but their words drifted rightward over time. Novak's experience covering the Six-Day War in the field influenced his beliefs towards Evans' pro-Palestinian sympathies.|$|E
25|$|During the Korean War, Novak {{served in}} the U.S. Army, and he reached the rank of lieutenant. He later stated that he had fully {{expected}} {{to die in the}} service. After serving from 1952 to 1954, he joined the Associated Press (AP) and became a political correspondent in Omaha, Nebraska. He was transferred to Lincoln, Nebraska, and then to Indianapolis, Indiana, covering the two state legislatures in his reporting. In 1957, Novak was transferred to Washington, D.C. where he reported on Congress. He left the AP to join the D.C. bureau of The Wall Street Journal in 1958, covering the Senate. He rose to the rank of chief <b>congressional</b> <b>correspondent</b> in 1961. He generally did his work without using a tape recordings or paper notes, relying just on his detailed memory. Novak's colleagues at The Wall Street Journal later said that he absorbed himself in his work so completely that he often forgot to shave, left his shoes untied, and even started accidentally placing burning cigarettes into his pockets.|$|E
2500|$|Magnifying the {{controversy}} {{of the race}} was {{a decision by the}} Washington Post to delay until after the election coverage of its year-long investigation into detailed claims of sexual abuse and assault made by 10 women against Packwood. The paper published the story two months after election day. Oregon's largest daily newspaper, The Oregonian, did not break the story either, despite its own investigation and its <b>congressional</b> <b>correspondent</b> being subjected to Packwood's advances. This led to a joke, [...] "If it matters to Oregonians, it's in the Washington Post (a twist on the Oregonian's slogan, [...] "If it matters to Oregonians, it's in the Oregonian.") The paper's editor would later admit to having been less than aggressive in pursuing the story due to concerns about [...] "…ruining a man's career." ...|$|E

5000|$|For {{the most}} part, each block {{of the program}} {{maintains}} an element of autonomy and different segments depending on who is hosting. For example, Stephanie Ruhle's edition {{of the show is}} formatted similarly to a morning news show, while Steve Kornacki and Nicolle Wallace's edition of the program is focused almost singularly on political interviews and campaign data analysis. Hallie Jackson's edition usually originates from the White House, where she is based, or an on-site location of the President's travels. However, all editions of the program focus on, breaking news events notwithstanding, live political news and developments. This portion of the news is primarily reported through daytime Washington, D.C.-based staffers such as NBC <b>congressional</b> <b>correspondents</b> Kasie Hunt and Mike Viqueira, judicial correspondent Pete Williams, Pentagon correspondent Hans Nichols, White House correspondents Hallie Jackson and Kristen Welker and national correspondents Peter Alexander and Chris Jansing ...|$|R
