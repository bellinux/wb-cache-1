25|$|A strong {{association}} {{has been identified}} between miR-569 and 3q26.2, a <b>chromosomal</b> <b>locus</b> that is amplified in some breast cancers. Altered expression of the miR-569 gene has been demonstrated to affect growth and proliferation of breast epithelial cells. Ectopic expression of miR-569 resulted in tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. This occurs through miR-569 inhibition of TP53INP1, a tumor suppressor gene. In comparison to normal tissues and less malignant tumors, TP53INP1 occurs at lower levels in more invasive cancers, presumably {{in part due to}} the role played by miR-569.|$|E

We have analyzed tumor DNA and normal DNA from eight patients with malignant melanomas using 24 polymorphic DNA probes and detected loss of heterozygosity in three patients at five loci on four different chromosomes. These results indicate that the frequency of loss of heterozygosity at <b>chromosomal</b> <b>loci</b> is relatively high in malignant melanomas, but that the regions lost are not restricted to specific chromosomes.

40|$|Studies of the {{transmission}} of nmrine leukemia virus (MLV) 1 to hybrids between the high-virus AKR strain and low-virus mouse strains selected for being sensitive to infection with the AKR MLV showed that transmission of virus followed mendelian segregation patterns (1). The AKR strain appeared to be contributing two unlinked <b>chromosomal</b> <b>loci,</b> each of which was capable of inducing detectable levels of MLV by 2 - 6 wk of age. To approach {{the question of whether}} these AKR loci are genetic elements of the virus itself or are genes which promote the expression of virus located elsewhere, it is necessary to use viral genetic markers. If the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>loci</b> are viral genomes, in crosses between AKR and low-virus mice carrying a genetically distinct endogenous MLV (which is not expressed in early life), the virus in the progeny should be AKR type. If the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>loci</b> are expression genes, then the virus-positive hybrids should show virus of both parental types.

40|$|AbstractThe {{number of}} {{indispensable}} <b>chromosomal</b> <b>loci</b> for a bacterium, Bacillus subtilis was estimated. Seventy-nine randomly selected <b>chromosomal</b> <b>loci</b> were investigated by mutagenesis. Mutation at only six loci rendered B. subtilis unable to form colonies. In contrast, mutants {{for the rest}} of the 73 loci retained the ability to form colonies. Mutant B. subtilis with multiple-fold mutations of those dispensable loci (7 -, 12 - or 33 -fold) were not impaired in their ability to form colonies on nutritionally adequate medium, indicating that up to 33 dispensable loci were simultaneously abolished. Given the statistical analyses for the frequency of indispensable loci (6 out of 79), total indispensable genetic material would be included within about 562 kbp.

40|$|AbstractFluorescence in situ {{hybridization}} {{combined with}} three-dimensional microscopy has shown that chromosomes are not randomly strewn throughout the nucleus but are in fact fairly well organized, with different loci reproducibly found in {{different regions of the}} nucleus. At the same time, increasingly sophisticated methods to track and analyze the movements of specific <b>chromosomal</b> <b>loci</b> in vivo using four-dimensional microscopy have revealed that chromatin undergoes extensive Brownian motion. However, the diffusion of interphase chromatin is constrained, implying that chromosomes are physically anchored within the nucleus. This constraint on diffusion is the result of interactions between chromatin and structural elements within the nucleus, such as nuclear pores or the nuclear lamina. The combination of defined positioning with constrained diffusion has a strong impact on interactions between <b>chromosomal</b> <b>loci,</b> and appears to explain the tendency of certain chromosome rearrangements to occur during the development of cancer...|$|R
40|$|Ecdysterone {{has been}} {{crosslinked}} in situ to polytene chromosomes of salivary glands of Drosophila melanogaster by photoactivation. The crosslinked hormone has been localized on the chromosomes by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. At different developmental stages the hormone was detected at different <b>chromosomal</b> <b>loci.</b> These <b>chromosomal</b> sites correspond to ecdysterone-inducible puff sites. Thus, the hormone binds directly to <b>chromosomal</b> <b>loci,</b> whose transcription {{depends on the}} presence of the hormone. Ecdysterone was also crosslinked to one puff site that regresses during larval development. This indicates that (i) hormone binding to polytene chromosomes activates transcription at specific loci, and (ii) hormone-dependent regression of intermolt puff 68 C is mediated by direct binding of ecdysterone. Ecdysterone was not detected on puff sites that are independent of hormone action or in chromosomal interbands. After heat shock, no ecdysterone became crosslinked to polytene chromosomes...|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional {{organization}} of the genome is important for regulation of gene expression and maintenance of genomic stability. It also defines, and is defined by, contacts between different <b>chromosomal</b> <b>loci.</b> Interactions between loci positioned on different chromosomes, i. e. "trans" interactions are one type of such contacts. Here, we describe a case of inducible trans interaction in chromosomes of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. Special DNA sequences, inserted in two ectopic <b>chromosomal</b> <b>loci</b> positioned in trans, pair {{with one another in}} an inducible manner. The spatial proximity diagnostic of pairing is observable by both chromosome capture analysis (3 C) and epifluorescence microscopy in whole cells. Protein synthesis de novo appears to be required for this process. The three-dimensional {{organization of}} the yeast nucleus imposes a constraint on such pairing, presumably by dictating the probability with which the two sequences collide with one another...|$|R
50|$|Many {{people in}} the past were misdiagnosed with a second type of IP, {{formerly}} known as IP1. This has now been given its own name - ''''Hypomelanosis of Ito'''' (incontinentia pigmenti achromians). This has a slightly different presentation: swirls or streaks of hypopigmentation and depigmentation. It is not inherited and does not involve skin stages 1 or 2. Some 33-50% of patients have multisystem involvement — eye, skeletal, and neurological abnormalities. Its <b>chromosomal</b> <b>locus</b> is at Xp11, rather than Xq28.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn bacteria, {{chromosomal}} architecture shows strong {{spatial and}} temporal organization, and regulates key cellular functions, such as transcription. Tracking the motion of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>loci</b> at short timescales provides information related to both the physical state of the nucleo-protein complex and its local environment, independent of large-scale motions related to genome segregation. Here we investigate the short-time (0. 1 - 10 s) dynamics of fluorescently labelled <b>chromosomal</b> <b>loci</b> in Escherichia coli at different growth rates. At these timescales, we observe {{for the first time}} a dependence of the loci's apparent diffusion on both their subcellular localization and chromosomal coordinate, and we provide evidence that the properties of the chromosome are similar in the tested growth conditions. Our results indicate that either non-equilibrium fluctuations due to enzyme activity or the organization of the genome as a polymer-protein complex vary as a function of the distance from the origin of replication...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWhile {{the action}} of many {{antimicrobial}} drugs is well understood at the molecular level, a systems-level physiological response to antibiotics remains largely unexplored. This work considers fluctuation dynamics of both the chromosome and cytosol in Escherichia coli, and their response to sublethal treatments of a clinically important antibiotic, rifampicin. We precisely quantify the changes in dynamics of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>loci</b> and cytosolic aggregates (a rheovirus nonstructural protein known as μNS-GFP), measuring short time-scale displacements across several hours of drug exposure. To achieve this we develop an empirical method correcting for photo-bleaching and loci size effects. This procedure allows us to characterize the dynamic response to rifampicin in different growth conditions, including a customised microfluidic device. We find that sub-lethal doses of rifampicin cause a small but consistent increase in motility of both the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>loci</b> and cytosolic aggregates. Chromosomal and cytosolic responses are consistent {{with each other and}} between different growth conditions...|$|R
