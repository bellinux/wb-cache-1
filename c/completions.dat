5|$|Durant {{signed a}} letter of intent to play college {{football}} at the University of North Carolina in 2000.

His freshman records for passing yards and <b>completions</b> were broken in 2007 by T. J. Yates. During his freshman season, Durant was named Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) Rookie of the Week five times. He finished second overall in ACC Rookie of the Year voting to Florida State quarterback Chris Rix.

5|$|During the Syracuse game, Kafka set {{a school}} record for {{consecutive}} <b>completions</b> in a game with 16, breaking the 47-year-old record set by Tom Myers in 1962. He set a new career-high in passingyards in a game by passing for 390yards, breaking his previous career-high in the season opener. Kafka also ran for a three-yard touchdown and threw three touchdown passes along with an interception. He caught a receiving touchdown when he tossed a lateral to Andrew Brewer who threw it back to Kafka for a 24-yard touchdown. Kafka became the first Big Ten Conference player to score at least one passing, receiving and rushing touchdown in a game since Zack Mills from Penn State accomplished it on September 4, 2004, against Akron. Kafka finished the game with 35 <b>completions</b> on 42 attempts. However, despite his record-breaking performance, the Wildcats lost 37–34. He was named Big Ten Co-Offensive Player of the Week on September 20 for his performance.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} a few algorithmic problems regarding the hairpin <b>completion.</b> The first problem we consider is the membership {{problem of the}} hairpin and iterated hairpin <b>completion</b> of a language.
