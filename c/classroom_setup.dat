50|$|At {{the time}} of the school's construction, trends in K-12 {{schooling}} were moving towards more non-traditional <b>classroom</b> <b>setups.</b> This manifested itself in the architecture and design of the building. When the school opened, there were no walls between almost all of the classrooms (save for the art, music, and science rooms). Rather, movable dividers were employed in a setup similar to what might be found in an office with cubicles. Additionally, both floors of the building were laid out with wings centered around a common area, rather than long and straight corridors. All of these elements were designed to increase interaction between classrooms and promote learning. Additionally, the lockers were formerly painted a bright orange color, which was thought to have a positive psychological effect for learning.In 1997, the school was threatened with closure, as it was stated by the Columbus school board that the building was operating far below capacity with approximately 550 students. This provoked a large public outcry, and it was later discovered that the capacity of 900 students as originally assumed was overstated. It was revised downward to approximately 750 pupils, but in recent years the school has had approximately 850 students attending due to its good reputation.|$|R

40|$|For {{many years}} {{engineering}} educators {{have been trying}} out new ways of teaching in their classrooms and seeking {{to go beyond the}} traditional lecture. It has been shown that students benefit from instruction that includes active, cooperative and inductive approaches. However, most of the time when we build a computer laboratory classroom it is set up to be optimum for the traditional lecture approach, with all the desks facing the front of the classroom. We recently renovated one of our computer classrooms focusing on alternative forms of instruction. We took a <b>classroom</b> previously <b>setup</b> with all the desks parallel {{to the front of the}} classroom and modified it to a “workshop ” format where all the desks were perpendicular to the front of the classroom. In addition the room is equipped with a range of technological aids including a classroom network. This set up: 1. allows the instructor to easily scan three quarters of the monitors in the classroom from one position and to scan all monitors by moving around the front of the classroom 2. allows for the instructor to easily circulate among the students 3. allows for cooperative learning exercises 4. removes student anonymity and therefore discourages improper use of the computers 5. improves instruction through additional technological aids. The overall classroom environment was also upgraded by making simple changes to the aesthetics of this room. A side benefit of this change was to increase the capacity of the room by 20 %. In this paper I review the design changes made to this classroom, describe the technology aids included, summarize our experience to date using this room and discuss additional improvements that are planned.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{focus in}} engineering syllabi on technical abilities {{has been well}} substantiated by the types {{of knowledge and skills}} required in industrial processes. However, the emerging requirements in industrial operating environments necessitate a more personal configuration of competencies facilitating both intrapersonal and interpersonal processes at workplace. The concomitant reform of engineering education to incorporate social competence into the technical education calls for a revision of pedagogy, as the traditional instruments applied in the dissemination of substance knowledge and technical skills provide little support for leveraging students’ social skills. This article discusses the learnability of socio-emotional abilities and reviews their most fundamental and pertinent skills. The results from a quantitative, empirical research conducted in engineering industries to identify predictors of social competence are reported and the implications on engineering pedagogy examined.

5000|$|The rapid {{spread of}} {{film in the}} 1920s and radio in the 1930s led to {{proposals}} {{to use it for}} distance education. By 1938, at least 200 city school systems, 25 state boards of education, and many colleges and universities broadcast educational programs for the public schools. One line of thought was to use radio as a master teacher. Experts in given fields broadcast lessons for pupils within the many schoolrooms of the public school system, asking questions, suggesting readings, making assignments, and conducting tests. This mechanizes education and leaves the local teacher only the tasks of preparing for the broadcast and keeping order in the <b>classroom.</b> A typical <b>setup</b> came in Kentucky in 1948 when John Wilkinson Taylor, president of the University of Louisville, teamed up with NBC to use radio as a medium for distance education, The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission endorsed the project and predicted that the [...] "college-by-radio" [...] would put [...] "American education 25 years ahead". The University was owned by the city, and local residents would pay the low tuition rates, receive their study materials in the mail, and listen by radio to live classroom discussions that were held on campus.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 In {{the current}} {{education}} environment, many instructors {{make use of}} some type of software, such as Visual Studio or a software library like OpenGL, in the <b>classroom.</b> Incorrect <b>setup</b> and configuration on an individual’s own system is a common problem when using these software tools. This thesis explores the difficulty that these setup and configuration problems create for the student learning experience {{as well as the}} instructor teaching experience. We interviewed ten instructors and four students as part of a qualitative study to gather data about the severity of this problem in preventing student learning and effective delivery of material. The participants were chosen from Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Statistics, and Robotics classes. The main criterion for the class selection was whether that class’ usage of software came with the potential of running into configuration issues. The study shows that almost all classes did suffer from configuration issues in software tools; these issues distracted the students from actual coursework, forcing them to expend their time and energy on resolving these issues instead. It was also found that instructors and students often resorted to a “use whatever works” or a “trial and error” strategy for dealing with the issues encountered, which did not guarantee the issues’ resolution. To help instructors and students resolve a substantial portion of these setup and configuration issues with software tools, we propose the design of a virtualized system which leverages an existing cloud tool OpenStack. This system modifies the services provided by OpenStack to enable easy access to preconfigured Virtual Machines which help to resolve these issues with setup and configuration. This thesis, along with presenting the result of the study, outlines this system framework. Furthermore, it discusses the system {{in the context of the}} data gathered and the types of problems that framework could effectively handle. The lessons learned from the study and from our system design can also help inform future solutions and systems...|$|R

In the meantime, due to the success of developments in processor fabrication, the computing power of Personal Computer (PC) is not to be ignored as well. Lots of high throughput type of applications can be satisfied by using the current desktop PCs, especially for those in computerized classrooms, and leave the supercomputers for the demands from large scale high performance parallel computations. The goal of this work is to develop an automated mechanism for cluster computing to utilize the computing power such as resides in computerized classroom. The PCs in computerized <b>classroom</b> are usually <b>setup</b> for education and training purpose during the daytime, and shut down at night. After well deployment, these PCs can be transformed into a pre-configured cluster computing resource immediately without touching the existing education/training environment installed on these PCs. Thus, the training activities will not be affected by this additional activity to harvest idle computing cycles. To echo today's energy saving issues, a dynamic power management is also developed to minimize energy cost. This development not only greatly reduces the management efforts and time to build a cluster, but also implies the reduction of the power consumption by such a mechanism...|$|R

40|$|During my 12 {{years of}} {{teaching}} career, I always prefer an Incremental and Interactive setup in the classroom teaching. For me learning {{should be done in}} small and manageable chunks with clear objectives and learning outcomes. Practical orientation meshed with theoretical basis is inevitable for the persistence of the earned knowledge. Furthermore, each learning chunk should be placed as a staircase where the next is built upon the previous ones and the progress is clearly visible. In addition to this, learning should be interactive as knowledge propagates mostly through discussion and exchange of views and ideas. Thus a teaching session must offer interaction among the participants. In my <b>classroom</b> <b>setup</b> I always encourage to through questions as well as critique to any raised issue. These elements to me are auspicious for teaching Software Engineering, where the relationship between learned knowledge and its practical perspectives are not explicitly visible, and often such connection never drawn during teaching.

40|$|Classroom {{environment}} influences each student's educational experience. The {{aim of this}} classroom evaluation was to gain {{a better}} understanding of how each gender functions in an introductory robotics class, where LEGOs and ROBOLAB were used as a tool to teach engineering principles and basic robotics concepts. A better understanding of how each gender performs in reaction to the <b>classroom</b> <b>setup</b> will hopefully lead to the development of a learning environment that is mutually beneficial to each gender. The course, a general freshman introduction to engineering, targeted for this evaluation required students to complete robotic challenges while working within groups and participating in design competitions. The present evaluation explored gender differences in self-confidence levels related to robotic tasks, feelings toward competitions as a component of the course, and differences in the way males and females interact within groups. Assessment was conducted through interviews, observations, and written questionnaires. Competency in robotics activities was found to be similar although males were found to be more confident of their own abilities. Both genders felt the competitions were enjoyable and integral to the atmosphere of the class. Males in the class took the competitions more seriously than did the females. Building and programming robots were thought to be their greatest areas of learning by the women. Males, on the other hand, cited working in groups and learning to compromise as the areas where they made the greatest improvements...|$|E
40|$|Context: Mindfulness {{forms an}} {{important}} component of meditation practice and has been increasingly popular around the world. There has been growing interest in studying the mindful component of various meditation techniques. One of the various forms of mindfulness is the practice of a unique technique called cyclic mediation (CM). We aimed at ascertaining the level of mindfulness in experienced practitioners of CM using a Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS). Materials and Methods: MAAS was administered anonymously in a <b>classroom</b> <b>setup</b> and two of the project coordinators were present to supervise the administration and to assist the participants where necessary. We executed a cross sectional design. One hundred and thirty-three (n = 133) healthy male volunteers (66 meditators and 67 non-meditators) with ages ranging from 25 to 35 years participated in the study. Meditators had a minimum 3 years experience of meditation. Results: Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 20. The data were checked for normality and an independent samples t-test was employed to compare the means of both the groups. MAAS scores were significantly higher in meditators as compared with the non-meditators (P < 0. 001). We found a positive correlation (r = 0. 620) between the years of meditation practice and the levels of trait mindfulness. Conclusions: CM can lead to development of higher levels of mindfulness and may have the ability to positively impact mental states and attention, thereby offering the potential for prevention of clinical levels of psychopathology and improving overall psychological well-being in healthy individuals...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of classrooms in schools today. With more and more children entering schools, the need for different types of classrooms has changed. There are people who feel as though separating students based on educational need is not beneficial. They believe that every child should have an equal chance of success. This can either be accomplished by separating students with special needs or keeping them included in the general education classroom. In an inclusive setting, students are educated in the general education classroom. There are usually less students with more teacher assistance. People are either for or against the notion of inclusive education. The research in my proposal is {{going to look at the}} views of different parties involved with this educational <b>classroom</b> <b>setup.</b> The reason for this research and literature review is to conclude whether or not inclusion is beneficial in the general educational classroom. The literature review section of this paper will look at the research in which has already been analyzed. It will take an in-depth look at the opinions of the school personnel, parents and students involved in this educational setup. Within all of these parts, the researcher will pick apart exactly what people do and do not like about inclusive education. It will find out if there are situations in which inclusion is more useful than others. This will allow the researcher to decide if any specific type of student with special needs is more likely to succeed when being placed in the general education classroom. The literature will state what people are concerned with and what they feel confident about when it comes to inclusion in the general education classroom...|$|E
40|$|The University of the South Pacific, one of {{only two}} regionally-owned {{institutions}} in the world encompasses twelve nations in the South Pacific Ocean. The institution provides education delivery through a total of seventeen campuses, with at least one in each country. To be able to overcome the physical divide and distance, while ensuring the quality of learning and teaching, the University utilizes internet bandwidth with student/staff interfacing applications such as Moodle, together with satellite and mobile phone technology to provide virtual classroom experience to students irrespective of location. The university has been a successful in these endeavors since the 1990 s. This paper outlines the approaches adopted in offering a first year chemistry course (CH 101) in dual mode; through face-to-face teaching as well as distance and flexible learning. The course enrolls 393 students, of which 25 % are registered in distance learning mode hundreds of kilometers away from the lecturer, who they will certainly never see during the delivery of the course. Yet, the course ensures delivery of course content, while students are able to share and access materials irrespective of location and mode, and have participative interactions with the teaching team and each other. The virtual <b>classroom</b> <b>setup</b> is aided by an educational support tool developed in Australia – Moodle. Moodle not only delivers their content, but allows assessment, real-time grade information, communication, performance analysis and intervention and upload of content for sharing with the class.

40|$|With the {{emergence}} of the use of the traditional (non-touch screen) notebook computer in the classroom, different teaching styles and equipment have been introduced. Teachers have started to use the Notebook PC to support their teaching. They now have the ability to gather and use a far greater range of materials in the classroom with little distraction. The introduction of the touch screen Tablet PC has brought another dimension to the way technology can be used in the classroom. This study seeks to investigate the ways in which Tablet PC technology has been used to enhance the learning of students within the classroom and how that differs from that of the traditional notebook. The {{purpose of this study was}} to look at ways in which the Tablet PC technology was being used in a specific school setting. It looked at how teachers used the Tablet PC in a classroom environment; investigated what unique features of the Tablet PC were being utilised; and for what purposes specific features were being used. It looked at how classroom dynamics changed; the physical look and feel of the classroom; as well as the changes in pedagogies around the use of the Tablet PC. Additionally, the study looked at teacher/student and student/student interactions as a result of the use of the Tablet PC. The study concluded that the Tablet PC was implemented with some success, within the selected school, and a number of unique features were used. The results suggested that in particular circumstances the dynamics of the classroom changed for the better as did <b>classroom</b> <b>setup,</b> pedagogies and interactions between students and teachers. The study found that there were a number of key indicators that needed to be improved before a Tablet PC program could become successful. These included: increased Professional Development for teachers around the use of the Tablet PC in the classroom; increased time allocation for teachers to investigate and create learning activities; improvements in the school’s infrastructure and quality of the students’ Tablet PCs. The study also recommended that once the key indicators have been met, another study into the use of the Tablet PC in a school setting should be conducted. This should be able to give a far greater indication of the role the Tablet PC has in education...|$|E
