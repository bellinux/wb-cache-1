Natasha also decides {{to drop out}} of her {{university}} course, upon realising that it is not right for her. Natasha meets Ed Lee (Sebastian Gregory) at Charlie's and offers to help him solve a maths equation, but he dismisses her. When she solves the problem, he invites her to a maths club. Natasha later transfers to his calculus course and Ed helps her with <b>conditional</b> <b>probability,</b> which they use to predict the outcome of a game of cards. They decide to play a game of Blackjack with a group of guys at Charlie's, but are forced to stop when a couple of police officers walks in. Natasha convinces Ed to hold a game at the Men's Shed, so they can continue to test the theory and make some money. Andrew comes up with an idea to use the theory to make an odds calculator mobile app. When Natasha goes to asks Ed about the idea, he introduces her to the hobby of LARPing, before agreeing to sign Andrew's contract.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an efficient computational method for performing sensitivity analysis in discrete Bayesian networks. The method exploits {{the structure of}} <b>conditional</b> <b>probabilities</b> of a target node given the evidence. First, the set of parameters which {{are relevant to the}} calculation of the <b>conditional</b> <b>probabilities</b> of the target node is identified. Next, this set is reduced by removing those combinations of the parameters which either contradict the available evidence or are incompatible. Finally, using the canonical components associated with the resulting subset of parameters, the desired <b>conditional</b> <b>probabilities</b> are obtained. In this way, an important saving in the calculations is achieved. The proposed method {{can also be used to}} compute exact upper and lower bounds for the <b>conditional</b> <b>probabilities,</b> hence a sensitivity analysis can be easily performed.

As a result, a number of well-known facts have special 'conditional' counterparts. For example: linearity of the expectation; Jensen's inequality (see conditional expectation); HÃ¶lder's inequality; the monotone convergence theorem, etc.|$|E
25|$|To {{develop a}} Bayesian network, we often first develop a DAG G such {{that we believe}} X {{satisfies}} the local Markov property with respect to G. Sometimes this is done by creating a causal DAG. We then ascertain the <b>conditional</b> <b>probability</b> distributions of each variable given its parents in G. In many cases, in particular in the case where the variables are discrete, if we define the joint distribution of X to be the product of these conditional distributions, then X is a Bayesian network with respect to G.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} classes of method for ancestral reconstruction. In chronological order of discovery, these are maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian Inference.

Maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood yield a single most probable outcome, whereas Bayesian inference accounts for uncertainties in the data and yields a sample of possible trees.|$|E

25|$|In linear regression, the {{relationships}} are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data. Such models are called linear models. Most commonly, the conditional mean of y given {{the value of}} X {{is assumed to be}} an affine function of X; less commonly, the median or some other quantile of the conditional distribution of y given X is expressed as a linear function of X. Like all forms of regression analysis, linear regression focuses on the <b>conditional</b> <b>probability</b> distribution of y given X, rather than on the joint probability distribution of y and X, which is the domain of multivariate analysis.|$|E
25|$|A discrete-time {{random process}} {{involves}} {{a system which}} is in a certain state at each step, with the state changing randomly between steps. The steps are often thought of as moments in time, but they can equally well refer to physical distance or any other discrete measurement. Formally, the steps are the integers or natural numbers, and the random process is a mapping of these to states. The Markov property states that the <b>conditional</b> <b>probability</b> distribution for the system at the next step (and in fact at all future steps) depends only on {{the current state of}} the system, and not additionally on the state of the system at previous steps.|$|E

Restricting to a finite universe of discourse, multivalued interpretations of basic probability assignments and of commonality functions are also obtained, in terms of <b>conditional</b> <b>probabilities</b> of pure inverse and subinverse images, or equivalently, in terms of <b>conditional</b> <b>probabilities</b> of truth sets of particular logical expressions involving possibilitations and necessitations...|$|R
