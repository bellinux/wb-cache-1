40|$|Mobile {{phones are}} seen as a means for social and {{economic}} progress in rural and remote areas of developing countries. In Bangladesh the availability and use of information and communication technology (ICT), particularly mobile phones, is thought to have accelerated the development of women in the rural population by creating the possibility of a wider connection. Using qualitative and quantitative methods for data collection, this research has investigated the impact of mobile phone use by women with particular emphasis on opportunities in health, education and livelihood. A sample of 99 women from three rural villages in Bangladesh showed that mobile phones provide easy access to health related services. Although impact on facilitating girls’ education appears to be limited, mobile phones have an indirect effect in ensuring security for girls. Respondents <b>confirmed</b> that <b>their</b> <b>overall</b> living standards have improved due to access to information on economic and income earning opportunities. These rural women also feel independent and empowered by access to a mobile phone. It can be argued that mobile phone technology can facilitate improvements in the living standards of rural women, which contribute to their personal development. Finally, the paper suggests that wide and innovative utilization of ICT is needed to accelerate development of women in the rural population with the help of low-cost mobile phone technology...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic grafts {{have been}} widely used in cardiac and {{vascular}} surgery since the mid 1970 s. Considering the relative lack of randomized clinical trials or systematic analyses in the field of prosthetic large vessel diameter replacement, we reviewed the literature on the longterm performance and surgical management of complications of Dacron® grafts in both thoracic and abdominal aorta reconstruction and in the pediatric population. MedLine, Embase and Cochrane Library databases were searched for metaanalyses, reviews, clinical trials, and case reports pertinent to the study object. Aortic replacement with Dacron® prostheses is widely performed with acceptable outcome and a relatively low rate of graftrelated and postimplantation complications, such as rupture, infection and fistulization. However, progressive dilation and mechanical failure of the grafts represent the most worrisome complication in all the districts analyzed. The emerging concept of the mismatch in the biomechanical properties between the prosthetic material and native aorta is thought to be at the root of these complications leading to even more daunting consequences when the ascending aorta is involved. Indeed introduction of a noncompliant prosthesis in place of the native ascending aorta can exert detrimental effects not only {{at the level of the}} anastomosis, leading to pseudoaneurysm, but also can influence the optimal performance of the aortic root complex with consequent valve dysfunction and ventricular hypertrophy. Albeit <b>confirming</b> <b>their</b> <b>overall</b> successful performance, this review launches a warning on the current liberal use of noncompliant grafts in aortic position, remarking the need for alternative vascular conduits mimicking the native artery compliance. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. While Bayesian network models {{may contain}} {{a handful of}} {{numerical}} parameters that are important for their quality, several em-pirical studies have <b>confirmed</b> that <b>overall</b> precision of <b>their</b> probabilities is not crucial. In this paper, we study {{the impact of the}} structure of a Bayesian network on the precision of medical diagnostic systems. We show that also the structure is not that important – diagnostic accuracy of several medical diagnostic models changes minimally when we subject their structures to such transformations as arc removal and arc reversal...|$|R
40|$|Most {{modelling}} studies {{addressed the}} effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPA) for fisheries sustainability through single species approach. Only a few models analysed {{the potential benefits of}} MPAs at the ecosystem level, estimating the potential export of fish biomass from the reserve or analysing the trophic relationships between organisms inside and outside the MPA. Here, we propose to use food web models to assess the contribution of a MPA to the trophic functioning of a larger ecosystem. This approach is applied to the Banc d'Arguin National Park, a large MPA located on the Mauritanian shelf. The ecosystem was modeled using Ecopath with Ecosim, a model that accounts for fisheries, food web structure, and some aspects of the spatial distribution of species, for the period 1991 - 2006. Gaps in knowledge and uncertainty were taken into account by building three different models. Results showed that the Banc d'Arguin contributes about 9 to 13 % to the total consumption, is supporting about 23 % of the total production and 18 % of the total catch of the Mauritanian shelf ecosystem, and up to 50 % for coastal fish. Of the 29 exploited groups, 15 depend on the Banc for more than 30 % of their direct or indirect consumptions. Between 1991 and 2006, the fishing pressure increased leading to a decrease in biomass and the catch of high trophic levels, <b>confirming</b> <b>their</b> <b>overall</b> overexploitation. Ecosim simulations showed that adding a new fleet in the Banc d'Arguin would have large impacts on the species with a high reliance on the Banc for food, resulting in a 23 % decrease in the current outside MPA catches. We conclude on the usefulness of food web models to assess MPAs contribution to larger ecosystem functioning...|$|R
