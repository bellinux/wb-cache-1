50|$|Single-factor {{productivity}} {{refers to}} the measurement of productivity that is a ratio of output and one input factor. A most well-known measure of single-factor productivity is the measure of output per work input, describing work productivity. Sometimes it is practical to employ the value added as output. Productivity measured {{in this way is}} called Value-added productivity. Also, productivity can be examined in cost accounting using Unit costs. Then it is mostly a question of exploiting data from standard cost accounting for productivity measurements. Efficiency ratios, which tell something about the ratio between the value produced and the sacrifices made for it, are available in large numbers. Managerial <b>control</b> <b>ratio</b> systems are composed of single measures which are interpreted in parallel with other measures related to the subject. Ratios may be related to any success factor of the area of responsibility, such as profitability, quality, position on the market, etc. Ratios may be combined to form one whole using simple rules, hence, creating a key figure system.|$|E
50|$|Ever since Pearl {{proposed}} {{the rate of}} living theory of aging, numerous studies have demonstrated its validity in poikilotherms. In mammals, however, satisfactory experimental demonstration is still lacking because an externally imposed increase of basal metabolic rate of these animals (e.g. by placement in the cold) is usually accompanied by general homeostatic disturbance and stress. The present study {{was based on the}} finding that rats exposed to slightly increased gravity are able to adapt with little chronic stress but at a higher level of basal metabolic expenditure (increased 'rate of living'). The rate of aging of 17-month-old rats that had been exposed to 3.14 g in an animal centrifuge for 8 months was larger than of controls as shown by apparently elevated lipofuscin content in heart and kidney, reduced numbers and increased size of mitochondria of heart tissue, and inferior liver mitochondria respiration (reduced 'efficiency': 20% larger ADP: 0 ratio, P less than 0.01; reduced 'speed': 8% lower respiratory <b>control</b> <b>ratio,</b> P less than 0.05). Steady-state food intake per day per kg body weight, which is presumably proportional to 'rate of living' or specific basal metabolic expenditure, was about 18% higher than in controls (P less than 0.01) after an initial 2-month adaptation period. Finally, though half of the centrifuged animals lived only a little shorter than controls (average about 343 vs. 364 days on the centrifuge, difference statistically nonsignificant), the remaining half (longest survivors) lived on the centrifuge an average of 520 days (range 483-572) compared to an average of 574 days (range 502-615) for controls, computed from onset of centrifugation, or 11% shorter (P less than 0.01). Therefore, these results show that a moderate increase of the level of basal metabolism of young adult rats adapted to hypergravity compared to controls in normal gravity is accompanied by a roughly similar increase in the rate of organ aging and reduction of survival, in agreement with Pearl's rate of living theory of aging, previously experimentally demonstrated only in poikilotherms.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} antimycin A and funiculosin, two inhibitors which block {{electron}} transfer in the b-c 1 complex, on electron flow and electrochemical potential difference of H+ ions in mitochondria at static head (state 4) is investigated. In addition, the respiratory <b>control</b> <b>ratio</b> is determined as the ratio between uncoupler stimulated and static-head electron flow. Malonate, a competitive inhibitor or succinic dehydrogenase, {{is used for}} comparison. All three inhibitors cause an extensive depression of static-head electron flow but only a limited decrease in the electrochemical potential difference of H+ ions. With the antimycin-type of inhibitors, the respiratory <b>control</b> <b>ratio</b> slightly increases up to about 50 % inhibition of electron flow and then steeply declines. With malonate, a strong decrease of the respiratory <b>control</b> <b>ratio</b> is observed in a concentration range where the electron flow is inhibited less than 10 %. It is shown than the data do not comply with the generally accepted hypothesis of a leak conductance being regulated by the electrochemical potential difference of H+ ions. They can be interpreted in terms of not tightly coupled redox-driven H+-pumps. A non-vanishing electron flow at static head then arises predominantly from molecular slipping in the pumps, and the (constant) leak conductance yields only a minor contribution...|$|E
40|$|Amyloid-beta (Aβ) {{pathology}} {{is related}} to mitochondrial dysfunction accompanied by energy reduction and an elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Monomers and oligomers of Aβ have been found inside mitochondria where they accumulate in a time-dependent manner as demonstrated in transgenic mice and in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain. We hypothesize that the internalization of extracellular Aβ aggregates is the major cause of mitochondrial damage and here we report that following the injection of fibrillar Aβ into the hippocampus, there is severe axonal damage which is accompanied by the entrance of Aβ into the cell. Thereafter, Aβ appears in mitochondria where it is linked to alterations in the ionic gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This effect is accompanied by disruption of subcellular structure, oxidative stress, and {{a significant reduction in}} both the respiratory <b>control</b> <b>ratio</b> and in the hydrolytic activity of ATPase.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the action of}} tamoxifen and estradiol on the function of isolated liver mitochondria. We observed that although tamoxifen and estradiol per se did not affect mitochondrial complexes II, III, or IV, complex I is affected, this effect being more drastic (except for state 4 of respiration) when mitochondria were coincubated with both drugs. Furthermore, using two respiratory chain inhibitors, rotenone and diphenyliodonium chloride, we identified the flavin mononucleotide site of complex I as the target of tamoxifen and/or estradiol action(s). Tamoxifen (25 microm) per se induced {{a significant increase in}} hydrogen peroxide production and state 4 of respiration. Additionally, a significant decrease in respiratory <b>control</b> <b>ratio,</b> transmembrane, and depolarization potentials were observed. Estradiol per se decreased carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) -stimulated respiration, state 3 of respiration, and respiratory <b>control</b> <b>ratio</b> and increased lag phase of repolarization. With the exception of state 4 of respiration whose increase induced by tamoxifen was reversed by the presence of estradiol, the effects of tamoxifen were highly exacerbated when estradiol was present. We observed that 10 microm tamoxifen in the presence of estradiol affected mitochondria significantly by decreasing FCCP-stimulated respiration, state 3 of respiration, respiratory <b>control</b> <b>ratio,</b> and ADP depolarization and increasing the lag phase of repolarization. All of the deleterious effects induced by 25 microm tamoxifen were highly exacerbated in the presence of estradiol. Furthermore, we observed that the effects of both compounds were independent of estrogen receptors because the pure estrogen antagonist ICI 182, 780 did not interfere with tamoxifen and/or estradiol detrimental effects. Altogether, our data provide a mechanistic explanation for the multiple cytotoxic effects of tamoxifen including its capacity to destroy tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells in the presence of estradiol.

Cisplatin (100 μM), although significantly reduced the growth of wild- type cells, only slightly altered {{the growth rate of}} Rho 0 cells.

Prolamellar body dispersal, primary thylakoid production, and the development of photosynthetic control were stimulated equally by 48 minutes of low irradiance, in cycles of 2 minutes every 2 hours, or by 9 hours of continuous light of moderate irradiance. Wheat plastids that greened for 6 hours in continuous light of moderate intensity did not exhibit photosynthetic control or much differentiation beyond the etioplast stage.
