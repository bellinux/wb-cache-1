2500|$|Tumult got {{underway}} from Peleliu on 19 September {{and set her}} {{course for}} yet another island strike — the assault on Ulithi. [...] She arrived off the atoll on 21 September and, through the following days, swept for mines to prepare this prize anchorage for use by American vessels. [...] On 23 September, {{the day of the}} unopposed landings, she swept 21 mines before a <b>contact</b> <b>mine</b> fouled her gear and forced her to retire to the disposal area to rid herself of both her port sweeping gear and the otherwise inextricable, offending mine. Tumult departed Ulithi on 25 September with a convoy of transports bound for Dutch New Guinea.|$|E
2500|$|As the Americans {{proceeded}} slowly, {{a lookout}} on Marblehead {{reported that the}} starboard propeller was foul of a buoy. The engine was stopped, and the propeller was cleared of the [...] "buoy", {{which turned out to}} be a <b>contact</b> <b>mine.</b> The mine was successfully disarmed. Afterward, it was learned that the ships had passed through a field of 18 such mines, or torpedoes, on the trip up the bay and through the same field on the return trip, without injury of any kind. A few days after the attack on Cayo del Toro, the mine field was thoroughly explored, and 14 mines were recovered. Their failure to explode on contact was attributed to mechanical faults, plus a healthy growth of barnacles on the contact levers.|$|E
5000|$|In 1938, the IJN {{was troubled}} by {{drifting}} <b>contact</b> <b>mines</b> from the National Revolutionary Army at Yangtze River. The IJN dispatched a lot of minesweepers and paravane equipment vessels (minelayers, torpedo boats and more) to Yangtze River, but they were damaged by a drifting <b>contact</b> <b>mines</b> too.|$|R

60|$|I {{bought a}} paper, {{went on to}} the railway station reading such details as were given of this triumph of the old civilization, of the blowing up of this great iron ship, full of guns and {{explosives}} and the most costly and beautiful machinery of which that time was capable, together with nine hundred able-bodied men, all of them above the average, by a <b>contact</b> <b>mine</b> towed by a German submarine. I read myself into a fever of warlike emotions. Not only did I forget the meteor, but for a time I forgot even the purpose that took me on to the railway station, bought my ticket, and was now carrying me onward to Shaphambury.|$|E

5000|$|Usually only {{created by}} contact mines, direct damage is a hole blown in the ship. Among the crew, {{fragmentation}} wounds {{are the most}} common form of damage. Flooding typically occurs in one or two main watertight compartments which can sink smaller ships or disable larger ones. <b>Contact</b> <b>mine</b> damage often occurs at or close to the waterline near the bow, but depending on circumstances a ship could be hit anywhere on its outer hull surface (the [...] mine attack being a good example of a <b>contact</b> <b>mine</b> detonating amidships and underneath the ship).|$|E

On completion of repairs, Abercrombie was sent for service in the Pacific, although the war ended before her arrival. She {{was used as a}} gunnery training and accommodation ship at Chatham after the war.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} mines {{were usually}} of this type. They are still used today, {{as they are}} extremely low cost compared to any other anti-ship weapon and are effective, both as a terror weapon and to sink enemy ships. <b>Contact</b> <b>mines</b> need to be touched by the target before they detonate, limiting {{the damage to the}} direct effects of the explosion and usually affecting only the vessel that triggers them.|$|R
5000|$|Although the Motor Minesweepers {{lacked the}} power to tow sweeps for <b>contact</b> <b>mines</b> they were {{suitable}} for handling equipment for combating magnetic mines and some later models were fitted with an acoustic hammer on a retractable [...] "A" [...] frame over the bows for countering acoustic mines. The Motor Minesweepers had limited use post-war so they were quickly disposed of.Three were transferred by Lend-Lease to the Soviet Navy.|$|R

25|$|After repairs, she {{departed}} Manus on 10 October 1944 with {{a sweeping}} unit of task group TG 77.5 {{bound for the}} Philippines. On the 17th, Tumult began sweeping Surigao Strait in gale-force winds; and on the 19th — the day before General MacArthur's landing on Leyte— she swept 26 <b>contact</b> <b>mines</b> which attested to the thoroughness of the Japanese defenses. On the 23rd, she anchored in the transport area of Leyte Gulf.|$|R
50|$|Pukkio (1939) and Porkkala (1940) were {{completed}} {{in time for}} them to participate in the war, but Pansio (1947) was completed only after the war when the resources needed for ship construction were again available. The ships had been designed primarily to operate as coastal liaison or transport vessels, but they had full minelaying as well as minesweeping equipment installed. However, the only mines the class ever laid were 37 <b>contact</b> <b>mines</b> that Porkkala laid northwest of Tuppura on 30 August 1941.|$|R

50|$|After World War I the {{drifting}} <b>contact</b> <b>mine</b> was banned, but was occasionally {{used during}} World War II. The drifting mines were {{much harder to}} remove than tethered mines after the war, and they caused about the same damage to both sides.|$|E

In addition, NEVZ manufactures mining equipment for open-pit mining, metallurgical enterprises - industrial locomotives DC {{new generation of}} induction motor drive, for coal mines - <b>contact</b> <b>mine</b> locomotives, mine cargo trucks.|$|E
5000|$|Naval mines were {{deployed}} {{in hundreds of}} thousands, or far greater numbers than in previous wars. Submarines proved surprisingly effective for this purpose. Influence mines were a new development but moored <b>contact</b> <b>mines</b> were the most numerous. They resembled those of the late 19th century, improved so they less often exploded while being laid. The Allies produced enough mines to build the North Sea Mine Barrage to help bottle the Germans into the North Sea, {{but it was too}} late to make much difference.|$|R
25|$|There {{was also}} present a French naval officer who, at the {{invitation}} of the Mediterranean Zone Board, acted as an observer. An aircraft carrier, HMS Ocean (Captain, later Admiral of the Fleet, Sir Caspar John), cruisers and other warships provided cover. Twenty-two <b>contact</b> <b>mines</b> were discovered and cut from their undersea moorings. The placement of the mines was such that the minefield was deemed to have been deliberately designed and not simply a random aggregation of isolated mines. Two of the cut mines were sent to Malta for further examination.|$|R
500|$|These torpedoes were improvised <b>contact</b> <b>mines.</b> [...] The {{first was}} devised by [...] "a Yankee, Mr. Krüger". [...] They {{consisted}} of a zinc cylinder containing a charge of gunpowder. The largest ever made used a charge of 1,500 lbs (680 kilos) and the explosion shook {{the ground at the}} town of Corrientes, Argentina twenty miles off. [...] The fuses were designed and made by George Frederick Masterman, chief apothecary to the Paraguayan Army: they were glass capsules of sulphuric acid which, when broken by striking a heavy object, ignited a potassium chlorate/sugar mixture.|$|R
50|$|On 16 April 1916 {{while on}} G Patrol off {{the mouth of}} the Dardanelles, she struck a <b>contact</b> <b>mine</b> off Gallipoli.

She took aboard stores at Roseneath and worked {{up off the}} Clyde during September. She sailed for the Far East independently.|$|E
5000|$|The LUGM-145 was an Iraqi {{produced}} naval moored <b>contact</b> <b>mine.</b> The mine had a 145 kilogram explosive warhead, and {{was basically}} a modern version of the old the Soviet M-08 mine. In February 1991, during the Gulf War, [...] struck a LUGM-145 mine, losing {{a third of its}} fuel, and sustaining damage that would cost 3.5 million US dollars to repair.|$|E
50|$|Initially, contact mines—requiring a ship {{physically}} {{strike a}} mine to detonate it—were employed, usually tethered {{at the end}} of a cable just below the surface of the water. <b>Contact</b> <b>mines</b> usually blew a hole in ships' hulls. By the beginning of World War II, most nations had developed mines that could be dropped from aircraft and floated on the surface, making it possible to lay them in enemy harbours. The use of dredging and nets was effective against this type of mine, but this consumed valuable time and resources, and required harbours to be closed.|$|R
