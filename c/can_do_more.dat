Regarding this change in her career path, Fields told Peary in 1980 that [...] "All these young filmmakers are possessive.

Disney agreed and Peet created an original treatment, with little supervision, as he had done with One Hundred and One Dalmatians and The Sword in the Stone. However, after the disappointing reaction to The Sword in the Stone, Walt Disney decided to become more involved in the story than he had been with the past two films, with his nephew Roy E.

A Hindu, as {{mentioned in the}} original series episode [...] "Riddle Of The Gold," [...] and a yogi, he held a fatalistic attitude towards the show's drama, reacting to situations [...] "from the philosophical {{point of view that}} everything is as it's supposed to be". Hadji often used wise aphorisms, taken from diverse cultures and sources and sometimes baffling Jonny. Lawrence cut Hadji's classic telekinesis to align his abilities with realistic yogi practices. [...] "He doesn't say things like 'Sim, Sim Sala Bim' anymore," [...] season one voice actor Michael Benyaer explained. [...] "The writers and producers actually researched the actual yogic powers.

[...] Steinhauer regarded Lody's ability to carry out his mission as [...] "practically nil" [...] and warned the Chief of Naval Intelligence not to send him to the UK, but the warning went unheeded. He recalled that [...] "as he had specially volunteered for the task– and I must admit there were very few people in Berlin just then anxious to accompany him– they allowed him to go." ...|$|E

500|$|In the 1962 U.S. Senate special {{election}} in Massachusetts, Kennedy initially faced a Democratic Party primary challenge from Edward J. McCormack, Jr., the state Attorney General. Kennedy's slogan was [...] "He <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> for Massachusetts", {{the same one}} John had used in his first campaign for the seat ten years earlier. McCormack {{had the support of}} many liberals and intellectuals, who thought Kennedy inexperienced and knew of his suspension from Harvard, a fact which later became public during the race. Kennedy also faced the notion that with one brother President and another U.S. Attorney General, [...] "Don't you think that Teddy is one Kennedy too many?" [...] But Kennedy proved to be an effective street-level campaigner. In a televised debate, McCormack said [...] "The office of United States Senator should be merited, and not inherited," [...] and said that if his opponent's name was Edward Moore, not Edward Moore Kennedy, his candidacy [...] "would be a joke". Voters thought McCormack's performance overbearing, and with the family political machine's finally getting fully behind him, Kennedy won the September 1962 primary by a two-to-one margin. In the November {{special election}}, Kennedy defeated Republican George Cabot Lodge II, product of another noted Massachusetts political family, gaining 55percent of the vote.|$|E
500|$|Programming was {{assigned}} to Tod Frye, who was not provided with any arcade design specifications to work from, and {{had to figure out}} how the game worked by playing it. The game uses a 4KB ROM cartridge, chosen for its lower manufacturing costs compared to 8KB cartridges, which had just become available at the time. After Atari acquired the rights to produce the game, Frye began work on a prototype version. The company wanted to release the prototype to capitalize on the 1981 holiday season. As with any contemporary arcade port, the simple Atari 2600 hardware was a considerable limitation. [...] The arcade PAC-MAN system board contained 2KB of main RAM (random-access memory) in which to run the program, 2KB of video RAM to store the screen state, and 16KB of ROM (read-only memory) to store the game code, whereas the Atari 2600 featured only 128 bytes of RAM memory and none dedicated to video: effectively 32 times less RAM. The Zilog Z80 CPU microprocessor used by the Namco Pac-Man arcade system is clocked at three times the speed of the MOS 6507 CPU in the Atari 2600, but the instruction sets and architecture for each processor are very different, and a 6507 <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> operations per clock cycle (effectively 2 to 1), making 1 to 1 comparisons more difficult than simply comparing clock speed.|$|E
500|$|Modal jazz of {{this type}} was not unique to this album. Davis himself had {{previously}} used the same method on his 1958 Milestones album, the 58 Sessions, and Porgy and Bess (1958), on which he used modal influences for collaborator Gil Evans's third stream compositions. Also, the original concept and method had been developed in 1953 by pianist and writer George Russell. Davis saw Russell's methods of composition {{as a means of}} getting away from the dense chord-laden compositions of his time, which Davis had labeled [...] "thick." [...] Modal composition, with its reliance on scales and modes, represented, as Davis called it, [...] "a return to melody." [...] In a 1958 interview with Nat Hentoff of The Jazz Review, Davis elaborated on this form of composition in contrast to the chord progression predominant in bebop, stating [...] "No chords ... gives you a lot more freedom and space to hear things. When you go this way, you can go on forever. You don't have to worry about changes and you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> with the [...] line. It becomes a challenge to see how melodically innovative you can be. When you're based on chords, you know at the end of 32 bars that the chords have run out and there's nothing to do but repeat what you've just done—with variations. I think a movement in jazz is beginning away from the conventional string of chords... there will be fewer chords but infinite possibilities as to what to do with them." ...|$|E

500|$|Sakura {{is a young}} ninja who is part of Team 7 {{alongside}} Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha {{under the}} leadership of their sensei Kakashi Hatake. Within Sakura resides [...] "Inner Sakura," [...] a manifestation of her inner emotions. In addition to comic relief, Inner Sakura represents Sakura's actual opinion on things when she outwardly displays something opposite. As Sakura has a deep infatuation for Sasuke many of her earlier appearances are dedicated to her continuing effort to win his affection. She accompanies the rest of Team 7 during all of its early missions, though she does little to contribute to the battles that take place. Sakura lacks any unique traits that set her apart from the rest of Team 7 although Kakashi notes that she has an excellent control over her chakra early in Part I. As a result, Sakura sits on the sidelines, content in allowing her teammates to protect her and defeat their opponents. During the Chunin Exams, when the rest of Team 7 is left in need of her protection, Sakura realizes that relying on others to fight her battles has been unwise. She resolves to better her ninja abilities from that point further, and {{throughout the rest of the}} series takes a more active role in Team 7's battles. After Sasuke's defection from Konoha at the end of Part I, Naruto's failure to bring him back, and Sakura's inability to help either of them, she becomes Tsunade's apprentice so that she <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> for her teammates in the future. Since then, Sakura makes it her personal goal to bring Sasuke home.|$|E
500|$|Reception towards Mulan's {{personality}} and characterization have been generally positive. Time Out hailed Mulan as [...] "A feisty young go-getter [...] {{rises above the}} male-dominated world in which she lives." [...] Ken Fox of TV Guide wrote, [...] "Intelligent and fiercely independent, Mulan... runs afoul of social expectations that a woman will be always obedient and duty-bound to her husband." [...] Bridget Byrne of Boxoffice wrote that [...] "Mulan... has pride, charm, spirit and aesthetic appeal which prevents her from being upstaged by the vigorous and exciting action in which she participates." [...] Varietys Todd McCarthy praised the character for inspiring [...] "a turn of the circle from such age-old Disney classics... in which passive heroines were rescued by blandly noble princes." [...] McCarthy continued, [...] "Here, it's the girl who does the rescuing, saving not only the prince but the emperor himself from oblivion, and this in a distant culture where women were expected to obey strictly prescribed rules." [...] Similarly, Margaret A. McGurk of The Cincinnati Inquirer lauded Mulan for [...] "solv her G.I. Jane dilemma by proving that brains <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> than brawn." [...] Hailing the character as [...] "Among the strongest heroines in Walt's cartoon canon," [...] Ian Freer of Empire enthused, [...] "Mulan's engaging mixture of vulnerability and derring-do becomes incredibly easy to root for." [...] Hollis Chacona of The Austin Chronicle dubbed Mulan a [...] "winning protagonist." [...] Likewise, the Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan wrote, [...] "As a vivacious rebel who has {{to be true to}} herself no matter what, Mulan is an excellent heroine, perfect for the young female demographic the studio is most anxious to attract", additionally calling her a [...] "more likable and resourceful role model than Pocahontas".|$|E
500|$|Following {{his injury}} in 1924, Gilligan {{could no longer}} bowl fast and, as a player, had little {{influence}} on the 1924–25 tour of Australia; his performances were hampered by further injuries. His best bowling figures of four for 12 came in the opening match and his only century came in the second game; he passed fifty just once more on the tour. His leadership proved influential in one main respect. In previous series, Australia had been superior to England in the field, but according to Gibson, Gilligan [...] "revolutionized the English fielding, a department in which they began to compare with Australia, {{for the first time}} since the war and possibly since the early 1900s. This had much effect on the England sides of the next few years". However an Australian newspaper estimated that England dropped 21 catches in the five Tests, which may have impacted on the series result; Australia won 4–1. Other aspects of Gilligan's leadership were less successful; his captaincy lacked tactical sophistication, and the Australian captain Herbie Collins proved superior in this respect. According to Gibson, critics claimed that Gilligan [...] "was too easygoing on the finer points of law". In addition, his inexperience led to defeat in one warm-up match that the MCC could have drawn, and commentators dismissed him as naive and easy-going on the field. However, he was immensely popular with the Australian public and well-liked by his team. Gibson, writing in 1979, noted that Gilligan [...] "was, and is, one of the most popular captains England have sent to Australia". During the tour, Gilligan was the focus of a great deal of publicity. The periodical Cricket described him as [...] "'one of the most jovial personalities imaginable", while former Australian Test captain Monty Noble wrote that Gilligan was the [...] "type of man who, in the most unostentatious way, <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> than all the politicians and statesmen to cement the relations between the Homeland and the Dominions". His sportsmanship, including his grace and cheerfulness in defeat, made him, according to Noble, a perfect English gentleman and an [...] "Empire builder".|$|E
