40|$|Banking law and {{bankruptcy}} law clash. This is most evident when a {{bank holding company}} (parent company) becomes insolvent after it has made an asset transfer to its financially troubled bank subsidiary. The Bankruptcy Code (Code) governs the insolvency proceedings of the bank holding company. Predictably, the parent company 2 ̆ 7 s trustee, appointed {{for the protection of}} all the creditors of the bankrupt entity, uses the fraudulent conveyance provision of the Code to have any asset transfers that were made to the bank subsidiary returned to the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s estate. The good faith exception to that provision will protect the asset transfer only if the parent company made the transfer for “good and fair consideration. ” The banking laws govern the regulation of the entire banking industry, including the insolvency of a financial institution. The banking laws, arguably, provide preferential treatment for the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund as a failed financial institution 2 ̆ 7 s potentially largest unsecured creditor. Banking law allows the parent company to make an asset transfer to avoid the threat of mandated restrictions. It also gives an unfulfilled payment a priority status in bankruptcy. The rules do not state, however, under what circumstances an unfunded <b>capital</b> <b>obligation</b> ought to be allowed. The legality of the asset transfer when a parent company seeks bankruptcy protection is a crucial question for the banking industry. Part II of the article identifies the statutory basis for the dormant conflict between Titles 11 and 12. Specifically, this section lists the broad array of somewhat identical discretionary powers that both the bankruptcy court and the banking regulatory agencies have as trustee and receiver for insolvent corporations and financial institutions, respectively. Part II concludes with an analysis of the cases in which these discretionary powers of the trustee and the receiver have come into conflict. Part III discusses the bankruptcy of the Bank of New England Corporation (BNEC). The factual history of this case provides an example of the types of legal issues that an insolvent holding company faces under the banking laws when it files for protection under the Bankruptcy Code. The section ends by specifying post-BNE legislative reforms designed to address issues raised during the liquidation of that failed enterprise. Part IV identifies the statutory rights that creditors have under the fraudulent conveyance law, including the good faith exception. Finally, Part V proposes an amendment to the current regulatory scheme that would require asset transfers from an insolvent holding company. It posits that the policies supporting the good faith exception are not compromised by the concomitant goal of protecting the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund. The banking enterprise exception establishes a procedure for regulatory assets transfers that is reviewable by the bankruptcy court, and operates as a credit against cross-guarantee liability. The proposed change will more closely merge the policies and purposes of the two schemes that converge when a bank holding company becomes insolvent...|$|E

The remaining 6 per cent included holdings of Latin American dollar bonds, other longterm loans, and shares in enterprises whose controlling interest is retained abroad. United States investment in the <b>capital</b> and <b>obligations</b> of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development also contributed indirectly to additional dollar investment in the area.

We perform the Forbes and Rigobon (2002) spillover test using daily bond yield data over the period 2005 to 2011. Results are twofold. First, we find that between most markets for individual U.

Second, we find no substantial spillover effect between shocks originating from state securities and from federal markets, {{except for a few}} large issuers. Using causality tests in the frequency domain, we find that the Treasury bond market directly causes changes in the markets for municipal bonds in both the short and long run. There is also some evidence of causality from the municipal to the Treasury bond market, but only of a long-run nature. Our results shed some light on the policy debate on the nature of spillover effects within fiscal unions.

40|$|Policy-makers have {{attributed}} {{the scale of}} the credit crisis and its profound impact on money markets (as well as financial sector stability) to the fast rise of securitization and the way it has arguably complicated both the conduct of monetary policy and the effect of interest rate transmission to the real economy. In our study, we examine whether financial innovation, specifically through securitization, has altered the nature of some macro-financial linkages, often with considerable policy implications. We find that securitization activity in the United States (mature market) and South Africa (emerging market) has indeed dampened the interest rate elasticity of real output via the balance sheet channel (while decreasing the interest rate pass-through from policy rates to market rates). That being said, current reservations about securitization do not invalidate the fact that securitization activity helps cushion the immediate impact of interest rate shocks to loan origination, which might be particularly effective in EM countries where poorly developed capital markets provide few alternatives to bank lending.

40|$|While {{the freedom}} to move capital is {{necessary}} for foreign investors, {{the power of the}} state to regulate capital transfers is necessary to prevent volatile capital from causing financial crises as well as to mitigate such crises when they occur. Thus, in regulating international capital movement, a balance should be made between the right to transfer funds and the state’s right to protect the stability of its economy. It is in relation to achieving this balance that this thesis argues that bilateral investment treaties’ (BITs) regulation of capital transfers is deficient, both substantively and procedurally. On substance, this thesis identifies three substantive defects that affect obligations under BITs: absoluteness, immediacy, and breadth. First, many BITs adopt an absolute approach in liberalizing capital that does not permit any restrictions or exceptions, nor does it distinguish between different kinds of capital, or between the right to import capital and the right to repatriate <b>capital.</b> Second, the <b>obligation</b> to permit transfers is immediate and does not allow for a gradual liberalization of capital. Third, many BITs’ terms and obligations are broad and therefore vague, such as the broad definition of investment, or the obligation to grant fair and equitable treatment, which is also broad and interpreted in a manner that restricts the regulatory powers of the host state. Such results could have been partly mitigated if there were a dispute settlement mechanism with the power to create precedent and with it a clearer and more coherent body of rules. But BITs’ investor-state arbitration is also deficient since it consists of ad hoc tribunals, which are not bound by precedent; and their decisions are not generally subject to substantive review. This leads to an inconsistent and incoherent body of law that protects neither the state’s regulatory powers nor the legitimate expectation of investorsEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

First, many BITs adopt an absolute approach in liberalizing capital that does not permit any restrictions or exceptions, nor does it distinguish between different kinds of capital, or between the right to import capital and the right to repatriate <b>capital.</b> Second, the <b>obligation</b> to permit transfers is immediate and does not allow for a gradual liberalization of capital. Third, many BITsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 terms and obligations are broad and therefore vague, such as the broad definition of investment, or the obligation to grant fair and equitable treatment, which is also broad and interpreted in a manner that restricts the regulatory powers of the host state. Such results could have been partly mitigated if there were a dispute settlement mechanism with the power to create precedent and with it a clearer and more coherent body of rules. But BITsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 investor-state arbitration is also deficient since it consists of ad hoc tribunals, which are not bound by precedent; and their decisions are not generally subject to substantive review. This leads to an inconsistent and incoherent body of law that protects neither the stateâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s regulatory powers nor the legitimate expectation of investor...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of {{socio-economic}} change and local electoral politics in a Central Thai district {{and is based on}} ethnographic research carried out between 1989 and 1990. Local electoral politics has received little attention in Thai studies in recent years. This thesis aims to fill this gap with detailed case studies of instances of elections for subdistrict head and provincial councillor positions. The cases reveal the practical and ideological strategies pursued by candidates and the means by which they mobilise the rural electorate and enlist the support of political patrons. The study describes candidates' use of local 'vote brokers', 'vote-buying' and political patronage. The parts played by members of a district-wide manufacturers' association, by national politicians and by religious leaders are also examined. The case studies serve to expose the contradictions between the rhetoric and practice of Thai local-level democracy. The strategies and structures of local politics are set {{within the context of a}} rapidly changing rural political economy. Two aspects of this, household economic differentiation and rural industry, are examined in detail. Economic differences between households are extreme and new relations of production are emerging. After surveying economic and social differences between households, the study focuses on a recently established brickmaking industry in 'Banglen' district. The industry is highly differentiated and relations of production are correspondingly complex. It is argued that owners of larger enterprises use patronage in their efforts to solve their problems with labour. The study describes an industry association that larger manufacturers have set up. The association promotes the interests of producers in several ways, not least by supporting members' attempts to win local office. Comparison of politicians' electoral strategies and employers' strategies with regard to labour reveals that there exists between them an underlying similarity. Both politicians and employers attempt to achieve their ends by drawing on the ideology of patronage and obligating the other in the relationship. Both use <b>capital</b> to construct <b>obligations</b> with moral connotations...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the two {{important}} issues {{of the law of}} capital market. Namely, the period of time in which the prospectus is valid (validity) and obligation to asupplement (to correct and update) the prospectus. The Law on the Capital Market of Serbia regulates validity of the prospectus, i. e. the time period in which the prospectus is valid. The prospectus shall be valid for 12 months after its publication {{for the purposes of the}} offers of securities to the public or the admission to a regulated market, under the condition that the information in the prospectus, where appropriate, updated by a supplement to the prospectus, containing the latest information on the issuer and securities which shall be offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market or MTF. The paper is particularly focused on the difference between the time of the validity of the prospectus and the period of the validity of public offering of securities. The time for which the prospectus is valid (validity) is an issue which is connected to the obligation to update and supplement the prospectus as well as to the ad hoc obligation to inform the public in the <b>capital</b> market. An <b>obligation</b> to supplement (to update and/or to correct). i. e. to create a supplement to the prospectus exists from the moment the prospectus is approved until the end of the public offering or until the securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market or MTF. An obligation to update and correct the prospectus indicates and obligation to include completely new relevant information in the supplement of the prospectus or to correct the relevant irregularities or incompleteness of information contained in the prospectus with regard the issuer and securities which are to be offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market or MTF, as long as those facts might be of relevance for the investment decision...|$|R

40|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1960 s, {{the credit}} financed {{purchase}} was well established in Sweden. The Swedish households were able to purchase goods, which had been considered unnecessary, or even luxurious, in the past. On the other hand, effective means to handle the increasing amount of debt and potential debtors were introduced; credit rating was registered, trade with insecure claims increased and if debtors could not fulfil their obligations, the creditors often used harsh or undue methods. By introducing Inkassolagen (1974 : 182), the legislator hoped to regulate the debt recovery process and ensure the fair treatment of debtors. The legislator also introduced liability for damages caused by a creditor in the collection process. Thus the debtor may claim damages when he or she has been exposed to an undue collection method, which has violated the debtor’s integrity or personal life. Compensation comprises economic and/or non-pecuniary loss that the debtor has suffered. From the beginning, it was noted that the liability rule was vague and imprecise, but the legislator was convinced that the rule would be clarified by the courts and regulations decided by datainspektionen, the supervising authority. Collection methods are methods used to force the debtor to fulfil his or her obligation. Normally, the creditor puts pressure on, or threats, the debtor. This procedure can be regarded as an exception to the state’s monopoly on use of force, and therefore {{it is not hard to}} see the necessity of the regulation. It should be noted that certain collection methods can be made subject to criminal prosecution, e. g. fraud, slander or libel. From an economical point of view, a well-functioning collection process is vital to an effective <b>capital</b> market. The <b>obligation</b> to repay a loan must not be forgotten; if debtors where not obliged to fulfil theirobligations, no one would be interested in making capital available for finance. But does this mean that creditors should be able to use any means available in the collection process? Based upon the prerequisites mentioned above, this thesis comprises a traditional legal and an economical analysis of the liability rule in inkassolagen. It has been the author’s intention to separate the two different views as far as possible...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores {{subjective}} and objective understandings of civic duty, obligation and good citizenship. Despite {{the importance of}} these drivers of behaviour, a lack of empirical understanding about what these drivers are and how they are understood has left a significant gap in our understanding of voting behaviour. My research contributes to the field by examining three central themes; Are duty, obligation and good citizenship understood the same? Are {{one or more of these}} traits suitable for cross-national research? Can a new conceptual model of civic duty help further the use of civic duty in studies of voting behaviour? In order to do this, this thesis analyses the following issues: (1) objectively exploring duty, obligation and good citizenship (2) analysing subjective understandings of these concepts (3) demonstrating individual level drivers of these concepts (4) demonstrating the impact of institutions, and cross-national differences have upon duty, obligation and good citizenship (5) showing how these concepts relate to voting behaviour (6) by testing and proving that a new approach to measuring civic duty can provide a model that explains not only long term immutable voting habits, but why individuals may vote out of duty sometimes, and abstain at others and (7) finally providing substantial evidence from what is an exploratory study to help in the formation of future representative research and to demonstrate the importance of taking civic duty seriously in forthcoming voting behaviour research. Using the theoretical and philosophical literature, I argue that despite the empirical literature treating obligation, good citizenship and civic duty as the same concept and driver of voting behaviour, that individuals understand these traits uniquely, and that they are all separate motivators, with duty being contingent on external forces (social <b>capital)</b> and <b>obligation</b> being contingent on personal or inward pressures. I argue that given the limited literature on good citizenship, there is no clear idea of what it means and that good citizenship will be contingent on what an individual deems to be "good". Finally, I argue that old models of civic duty are outdated, and that a new conceptual framework of duty needs to be introduced to accurately demonstrate how individuals understand it, and actually demonstrate its impact upon individual level voting behaviour. Using data from a pilot study, with an embedded survey experiment (N= 735) collected in the United Kingdom, the United States, New Zealand, Australia and Ireland, I demonstrate that not only are duty, obligation and good citizenship understood differently, but the drivers of the concepts are significantly different. While obligation shows no relationship to voting behaviour within or across countries, good citizenship appears to be a good driver of second order elections while civic duty appears to drive first order and high saliency elections. Duty appears to be contingent upon external factors, while good citizenship appears to be contingent upon the behaviour of politicians, and citizenship education suggesting a social contract type relationship. Institutional factors appear to indirectly impact voting behaviour with a mediating effect on the strengths of duty and good citizenship. Finally, evidence suggests that previous notions of an "immutable" sense of duty are unfounded, and that an individuals’ sense of duty is contingent on a range of internal and external pressures. The first empirical chapter focuses on individual level understandings of duty, obligation and good citizenship, before the second empirical chapter expands this to look at cross-national differences in the understanding of, and drivers of duty obligation and good citizenship. Finally, the third empirical analyses a new model of civic duty and suggests that its previous use has been limited by ineffective measures. While the evidence presented in this thesis is exploratory and not generalisable or representative of any of the countries sampled, the evidence from the sample strongly suggests that future development of the study of civic duty, and further analysis of how duty, obligation and good citizenship are understood in representative samples are needed to confirm the findings presented in this thesis, and build upon what is a successful pilot study. This research finds its limitations in the number of survey items available to build a complete picture of all drivers of individual understandings of duty, obligation and good citizenship...|$|R
