25|$|With {{a further}} {{decision}} of the European Parliament, the IBAN scheme for bank accounts fully replaced the domestic numbering schemes from 31 December 2012. On 16 December 2010, the European Commission published proposed regulations that will make IBAN support mandatory for domestic <b>credit</b> <b>transfer</b> by 2013 and for domestic direct debit by 2014 (with a 12 and 24 months transition period respectively). Some countries have already replaced their traditional bank account scheme by IBAN. This includes Switzerland where IBAN was introduced for national <b>credit</b> <b>transfer</b> on 1 January 2006 and the support for the old bank account numbers has not been required from 1 January 2010.|$|E
25|$|In July 2007 a {{new system}} of credits, {{compatible}} with the European <b>Credit</b> <b>Transfer</b> and Accumulation System, was introduced in which one credit (högskolepoäng) in the new system corresponds to one ECTS credit and two-thirds of a credit in the old system (poäng).|$|E

25|$|Some {{countries}} {{introduced the}} European <b>Credit</b> <b>Transfer</b> and Accumulation System (ECTS) and discussed their degree structures, qualifications, financing {{and management of}} higher education and mobility programmes. At the institutional level, the reform involved higher-education institutions, their faculties or departments, student and staff representatives and other factors. Priorities varied by country and institution.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, {{the recent}} Bologna Accord {{established}} uniformity in {{three levels of}} higher education: Bachelor (three or four years), Masters (one or two years, in addition {{to three or four}} years for a Bachelor), and Doctorate (an additional three or four years after a Master). Students can acquire professional experience after their initial bachelor's degree at any European institution and later complete their masters in any other European institution via the European <b>Credit</b> <b>Transfer</b> and Accumulation System.|$|E
25|$|Based on a 20 December 2011 memorandum, the EU {{parliament}} {{resolved the}} mandatory dates for {{the adoption of}} the IBAN on 14 February 2012. From 1 February 2014, all national systems for <b>credit</b> <b>transfer</b> and direct debit must be abolished and replaced by an IBAN-based system. This will be extended to all cross-border SEPA transactions from 1 February 2016 (Article 5 Section 7). After these dates the IBAN will be sufficient to identify an account for home and foreign financial transactions in SEPA countries and banks will no longer be permitted to require that the customer supply the BIC for the beneficiary's bank.|$|E

25|$|The IBAN {{designation}} {{scheme was}} chosen as the foundation for electronic straight-through processing in the European Economic Area. The European Parliament mandated that a bank charge needs to be the same amount for domestic <b>credit</b> <b>transfers</b> as for cross-border <b>credit</b> <b>transfers</b> regulated in decision 2560/2001 (updated in 924/2009). This regulation took effect in 2003. Only payments in euro up to €12,500 to a bank account designated by its IBAN were covered by the regulation.|$|R

The Master studies encompass two basic programs – business law and administrative-judicial programs, as well as a large number of so-called open Master programs in various areas. The law school has adopted and complies to the European <b>Credit</b> <b>Transfer</b> and Accumulation System.|$|E

This university has partnership programs with many universities around the world, such as the University of California at San Diego, Berkeley College, University of Frankfurt, Technische Universität München, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Universidad de Buenos Aires, and many other top universities around the globe.

25|$|The Euro Payments {{regulation}} {{has been}} {{the foundation for the}} decision to create a Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). The European Central Bank has created the TARGET2 interbank network that unifies the technical infrastructure of the 26 central banks of the European Union (although Sweden and the UK have opted-out). SEPA is a self-regulatory initiative by the banking sector of Europe as represented in the European Payments Council (EPC). The European Union made the scheme mandatory through the Payment Services Directive published in 2007. Since January 2008, all countries must support SEPA <b>credit</b> <b>transfer,</b> and SEPA direct debit must be supported since November 2009. The regulation on SEPA payments increases the charge cap (same price for domestic payments as for cross-border payments) to €50,000.|$|E

25|$|While high {{performing}} Asian {{economies and}} the six oldest ASEAN members have invested heavily in public education at the primary and secondary levels, tertiary education has been left largely to the private sector. Tertiary education in Southeast Asia is, in general, relatively weak in terms of technological capacity and integration such as in <b>credit</b> <b>transfer</b> schemes. Singapore is highly focused on innovation {{while the rest of}} the region lags behind. In most cases, universities are focused on teaching and service to government rather than academic research. Universities in Southeast Asia, both in terms of academic salaries and research infrastructure (libraries, laboratories), tend to be poorly supported financially. Moreover, regional academic journals cater to their local audiences and respond less to international standards which makes universal or regional benchmarking difficult.|$|E
25|$|The {{high school}} offers a dual {{enrollment}} program. This state program permits {{high school students}} to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits.

25|$|SEBI first confronted Saradha Group in 2009. Saradha Group {{adapted by}} {{opening up to}} 200 new {{companies}} to create more cross-holdings. This created an extremely complex tiered corporate structure to confound SEBI by hampering their ability to consolidate blame. SEBI persisted in its investigation through 2010.

25|$|This {{reform was}} {{elaborated}} {{in order to}} attain an education system based {{on the development of}} competences rather than on the transmission of knowledge, and included the development of a system of easily readable and comparable degrees aimed to simplify comparison between qualifications across Europe. The flexibility and transparency enabled students to have their qualifications recognised more widely, facilitating freedom of movement around a more transparent EHEA (European Higher Education Area). This was aided by the establishment of a system of credits {{in the form of the}} European <b>Credit</b> <b>Transfer</b> System (ECTS) and the adoption of the Diploma Supplement by all countries involved. One academic year corresponds to 60 ECTS-credits that are equivalent to 1500–1800 hours of study. The new model comes closer to the North American and Japanese systems. It gives greater weight to practical training, intensive research projects and the way credits are measured reflects how hard a student has worked. The new evaluation methods reflect not only a student's performance on exams, but also his or her lab experiments, presentations, hours spent on study, innovation capacities and so forth.|$|E

40|$|The study applies two {{approaches}} for {{the estimation of}} the social costs of main payment instruments (cash, debit card and credit card transactions, <b>credit</b> <b>transfers,</b> direct debits, business-to-business direct debits, postal inpayment money orders, postal outpayment money orders for pensions) used in Hungary in 2009. The first approach {{is based on the}} current payment structure, while the second approach is based on a more modern, hypothetical payment structure involving less cash, with no use of paper-based methods. In the first approach, the social cost amounts to HUF 388 billion, i. e. 1. 49 % of the GDP, while in the second approach, such cost amounts to HUF 285 billion, i. e. 1. 09 % of the GDP. In this context, social cost means the use of all resources (time, materials and money) necessary for the execution of payments, calculated as a net value (i. e. exclusive of fees paid for payment services). Thus, HUF 103 billion could be saved in social costs if the use of payment instruments were to be modified. private cost, social cost, net private cost, unit cost, social savings, cash transactions, debit card transactions, credit card transactions, paper-based <b>credit</b> <b>transfers,</b> electronic <b>credit</b> <b>transfers,</b> direct debits, business-to-business direct debits, postal inpayment money orders, postal outpayment money orders for pensions...|$|R
