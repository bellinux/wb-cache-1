25|$|The open {{canopy of}} cumin is another problem. Only a low {{proportion}} of the incoming light is absorbed. The leaf area index (LAI) of cumin is low (about 1.5). This might be a problem because weeds can compete with cumin for essential resources such as water and light and thereby lower yield. The slow growth and a short stature of cumin favours weed competition additionally. Two hoeing and weeding sessions (30 and 60 days after sowing) are needed for the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeds.</b> During the first weeding session (30 days after sowing), thinning should be done, as well, to remove excess plants. The use of preplant or pre-emergence herbicides is very effective in India, but this kind of herbicide application requires soil moisture for a successful weed control.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> <b>control</b> on fertilizer nitrogen use efficiencies (NUEs) by rice genotypes was {{studied in}} the Senegal River valley of West Africa with a field experiment during four rice growing seasons. It was hypothesized that integrated management of technologies could improve rice productivity. The objective was to develop integrated high-return technologies that improve irrigated rice-based systems productivity and profitability. Data indicated that rice grain yields were affected by N fertilizer, genotypes and plant densities. In good weed control conditions, optimum doses of recommended N fertilizer varied from 80 to 180 kg N ha– 1. Fertilizer N use efficiencies by genotypes were affected by weed control. Profitable management options of genotypes and N fertilizer recommendations have been identified. With a good <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>weed,</b> varieties and N fertilizer recommendations were suggested as integrated management options for farmers. But poor <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>weed</b> increased N lost, decreased grain yields and profitability.
