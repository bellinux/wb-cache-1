40|$|Cryptdins are {{antimicrobial}} peptides of the defensin {{family that}} {{are produced by}} intestinal Paneth cells. mRNAs encoding 17 <b>cryptdin</b> isoforms have been characterized from a cDNA library generated from a single jejunal crypt.

The antimicrobial activities of cryptdins 1 to 6 were tested against Escherichia coli ML 35 in two assays.

Because of the recent finding that intestinal defensins, also known as <b>cryptdins,</b> are synthesized by the Paneth cells of the small intestinal crypts and released into the lumen, we asked whether defensins and other small cationic antimicrobial peptides could kill the trophozoites of Giardia lamblia, which colonize the small intestine. Four mouse <b>cryptdins,</b> two neutrophil defensins (HNP- 1 [human] and NP- 2 [rabbit]), and the unique tryptophan-rich bovine neutrophil polypeptide indolicidin each had some antigiardial activity against trophozoites in vitro. <b>Cryptdins</b> 2 and 3, indolicidin, and NP- 2 each reduced viability by more than 3 log units in 2 h, and killing by all peptides was dose and time dependent. Exposure of trophozoites to peptides frequently resulted in cell aggregation and dramatic changes in morphology. The mechanism of binding and lysis appeared to involve charge interactions, since 150 mM NaCl as well as millimolar levels of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + inhibited killing by most of the peptides.

To reduce the dose of antibiotic required in order to decrease the associated side effects, the present study was aimed at evaluating the synergism between <b>cryptdin</b> 2 (a Paneth cell antimicrobial peptide) and ampicillin (Amp) against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. The synergy was evaluated in terms of the fractional bactericidal concentration (FBC) index, time-kill assay results (in vitro), macrophage functions, i. e., intracellular killing, lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase activity, and generation of nitrite (ex vivo), and decreases in CFU of salmonellae in livers, spleens, and small intestines of infected mice treated with <b>cryptdin</b> 2 and/or Amp (in vivo). In vitro synergism between the two agents was observed on the basis of the FBC index and time-kill assays. When the agents were used in combination, ex vivo studies revealed an enhanced effect on macrophage functions, particularly exhibiting a synergetic effect in terms of SOD levels. In vivo synergy was indicated by larger log unit decreases in all target organs of mice treated with the combination than those for the drugs used alone. These results point toward the possible use of <b>cryptdin</b> 2 as an adjunct to ampicillin and may help in developing alternate strategies to combat Salmonella infections...|$|E
40|$|Paneth {{cells are}} {{specialized}} small intestine epithelial cells that contain lysozyme, possess phagocytic properties, and secrete cytoplasmic granules into the intestinal crypt lumen after {{the entry of}} bacteria.

Cell Biol. 108 : 1687 - 1695, 1989) indicated that murine Paneth cells produce prodefensin mRNA, but the properties of its peptide product were not reported. We purified two closely related defensins, <b>cryptdin</b> 1 and <b>cryptdin</b> 2, from a subcellular fraction of murine small intestine cells that was enriched in Paneth cells. Both peptides contained 35 amino acid residues, including the characteristic defensin "signature" of six invariantly conserved cysteines. Cryptdins 1 and 2 were approximately 90 to 95 % homologous {{to each other and}} to the carboxy-terminal domain of the 93 -amino-acid defensin precursor, <b>cryptdin</b> A, described by Ouellette and associates (Ouellette et al., J. Cell Biol. 108 : 1687 - 1695, 1989). Both cryptdins exerted bactericidal activity against Listeria monocytogenes EGD and Escherichia coli ML- 35 p in vitro. Their potency exceeded that of human neutrophil defensin HNP- 1 but was considerably lower than that of NP- 1, a defensin produced by rabbit neutrophils and alveolar macrophages. Both cryptdins killed mouse-avirulent Salmonella typhimurium 7953 S (phoP) much more effectively than its phoP+, mouse-virulent, isogenic counterpart, S. typhimurium 14028 S. Our data indicate that mouse intestinal prodefensins are processed into 35 -amino-acid mature defensins (cryptdins) with broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties. The production of defensins and lysozyme by Paneth cells may enable them to protect the small intestine from bacterial overgrowth by autochthonous flora and from invasion by potential pathogens that cause infection via the peroral route, such as L. monocytogenes and Salmonella species...|$|E
40|$|Secretions of Paneth, {{intermediate}} and {{goblet cells}} have {{been implicated in}} innate intestinal host defense. We have investigated the role of T cells in effecting alterations in small intestinal epithelial cell populations induced by infection with the nematode Trichinella spiralis. Small intestinal tissue sections from euthymic and athymic (nude) mice, and mice with combined deficiency in T-cell receptor β and δ genes [TCR(β/δ) −/–] infected orally with T. spiralis larvae, were examined by electron microscopy and after histochemical and lineage-specific immunohistochemical staining. Compared with uninfected controls, Paneth and intermediate cell numbers increased significantly in infected euthymic and nude mice but not infected TCR(β/δ) −/– mice.

40|$|Mouse Paneth cell α-defensins, termed <b>cryptdins,</b> are {{secreted}} {{into the}} intestinal lumen, exert microbicidal activity {{and contribute to}} intestinal innate immunity. Among them, cryptdin- 4 (Crp 4) has the most potent microbicidal activity. In the intestinal lumen, commensal bacteria colonize and elicit beneficial effects to the host. However, the effects of Crp 4 against commensal bacteria are poorly understood. Thus, we investigated the bactericidal activities of Crp 4 against commensal bacteria compared to non-commensal bacteria. Oxidized Crp 4 showed only minimal or no bactericidal activity against 8 out of 12 commensal bacterial species, including Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus Casei. We further addressed a role of the conserved disulfide bonds of Crp 4 by analyzing reduced Crp 4 (r-Crp 4). r-Crp 4 demonstrated significantly greater bactericidal activities against 7 of 12 commensal bacteria than did oxidized Crp 4. Oxidized Crp 4 and r-Crp 4 elicited equivalently potent bactericidal activities against 11 of 11 non-commensal bacteria tested such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and 5 of 12 commensal bacteria. Furthermore, when r-Crp 4 was exposed to a processing enzyme of <b>cryptdins,</b> MMP- 7, r-Crp 4 was degraded and bactericidal activities disappeared. These findings suggest that Crp 4 has selective bactericidal activities against intestinal microbiota and that the activities are dependent on the disulfide bonds...|$|R

The most abundant enteric defensin, cryptdin- 1, had antimicrobial activity against an attenuated phoP mutant of Salmonella typhimurium but was not active against the virulent wild-type parent. Immunohistochemical localization demonstrated that cryptdin- 1, and probably cryptdins 2 and 3, occur exclusively in Paneth cells, where the peptides appear to be associated with cytoplasmic granules. Biochemical and immunologic analysis of the luminal contents of the small intestine suggest that <b>cryptdin</b> peptides are secreted into the lumen, similar to Paneth cell secretion of lysozyme. The presence of several enteric defensins in the intestinal epithelium, evidence of their presence in the lumen, and the antibacterial activity of cryptdin- 1 suggest that these peptides contribute to the antimicrobial barrier function of the small bowel mucosa...|$|E

The activity of 15 P- 1 culture medium was increased 10 - to 50 -fold {{in the presence of}} fractions enriched in round spermatids and of nerve growth factor.

We explored whether enteric pathogens can interfere with this arm of defense. We found that oral inoculation of mice with wild-type Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium decreases the expression of α-defensins (called <b>cryptdins</b> in mice) and lysozyme. Oral inoculation with Salmonella serovar Typhimurium strains that are heat killed, lack the PhoP regulon, and lack the SPI 1 type III secretion system or with Listeria monocytogenes does not have this effect.

40|$|Paneth cells {{represent}} one of {{the four}} major epithelial lineages in the mouse small intestine. It is the only lineage that migrates downward from the stem-cell zone located in the lower portion of the crypt of Lieberkühn to the crypt base. Mature Paneth cells release growth factors, digestive enzymes, and antimicrobial peptides from their apical secretory granules. Some of these factors may affect the crypt stem cell, its transit-cell descendants, differentiating villus-associated epithelial lineages, and/or the gut microflora. We used single and multilabel immunocytochemical methods to study Paneth cell differentiation during and after completion of gut morphogenesis in normal, gnotobiotic, and transgenic mice as well as in intestinal isografts. This lineage emerges coincident with cytodifferentiation of the fetal small intestinal endoderm, formation of crypts from an intervillus epithelium, and establishment of a stem-cell hierarchy. The initial differentiation program involves sequential expression of cryptdins, a phospholipase A 2 (enhancing factor), and lysozyme. A dramatic increase in Paneth cell number per crypt occurs during postnatal days 14 - 28, when crypts proliferate by fission. Accumulation of fucosylated and sialylated glycoconjugates during this period represents the final evolution of the lineage's differentiation program. Establishment of this lineage is not dependent upon instructive interactions from the microflora. Transgenic mice containing nucleotides - 6500 to + 34 of the Paneth cell-specific mouse <b>cryptdin</b> 2 gene linked to the human growth hormone gene beginning at its nucleotide + 3 inappropriately express human growth hormone in a large population of proliferating and nonproliferating cells in the intervillus epithelium up to postnatal day 5.

50|$|Defensins are {{produced}} constitutively and/or {{in response to}} microbial products or proinflammatory cytokines. Some defensins are also called corticostatins (CS) because they inhibit corticotropin-stimulated corticosteroid production. The mechanism(s) by which microorganisms are killed and/or inactivated by defensins is not understood completely. However, it is generally believed that killing {{is a consequence of}} disruption of the microbial membrane. The polar topology of defensins, with spatially separated charged and hydrophobic regions, allows them to insert themselves into the phospholipid membranes so that their hydrophobic regions are buried within the lipid membrane interior and their charged (mostly cationic) regions interact with anionic phospholipid head groups and water. Subsequently, some defensins can aggregate to form 'channel-like' pores; others might bind to and cover the microbial membrane in a 'carpet-like' manner. The net outcome is the disruption of membrane integrity and function, which ultimately leads to the lysis of microorganisms. Some defensins are synthesized as propeptides which may be relevant to this process. Alpha defensins of the mouse bowel were historically called <b>cryptdins</b> when first discovered.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Stem cells {{within the}} {{intestinal}} epithelium generate daughter cells that undergo lineage commitment and maturation through the combined {{action of the}} Wnt and Notch signaling cascades. Both pathways, in turn, regulate transcription factor networks that further define differentiation toward either enterocytes or 1 of 3 secretory cell lineages (Paneth, goblet, or enteroendocrine cells). In this study, we investigated {{the role of the}} Wnt-responsive, Ets-domain transcription factor Spdef in the differentiation of goblet and Paneth cells. METHODS: The in vivo function of Spdef was examined by disrupting the Spdef gene in mice (Spdef(-/-) mice) and analyzing the intestinal phenotype using a range of histologic techniques and DNA microarray profiling. RESULTS: In accordance with expression data, we found that loss of Spdef severely impaired the maturation of goblet and Paneth cells and, conversely, led to an accumulation of immature secretory progenitors. Spdef appears to positively and negatively regulate a specific subset of goblet and Paneth cell genes, including <b>Cryptdins,</b> Mmp 7, Ang 4, Kallikreins, and Muc 2. CONCLUSIONS: Spdef acts downstream of Math 1 to promote terminal differentiation of a secretory progenitor pool into Paneth and goblet cells. ...|$|R
40|$|Robust {{biological}} rhythms {{have been}} shown to affect life span. Biological clocks can be entrained by two feeding regimens, restricted feeding (RF) and caloric restriction (CR). RF restricts the time of food availability, whereas CR restricts the amount of calories with temporal food consumption. CR is known to retard aging and extend life span of animals via yet unknown pathways. We hypothesize that resetting the biological clock could be one possible mechanism by which CR extends life span. As it is experimentally difficult to uncouple calorie reduction from temporal food consumption, we took advantage of the transgenic mice MUPA overexpressing a serine protease implicated in brain development and plasticity that exhibit spontaneously reduced eating and increased life span. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that MUPA mice exhibit robust expression of the clock genes mPer 1, mPer 2, mClock, and mCry 1, but not mBmal 1 in the liver. We also found changes in the circadian amplitude and/or phase of clock-controlled output systems, such as feeding behavior, body temperature, and enteric <b>cryptdin</b> expression. A change in the light/dark regimen led to modified clock gene expression and abrogated circadian patterns of food intake in WT and MUPA mice...|$|E
40|$|Cationic {{amino acids}} {{contribute}} to α-defensin bactericidal activity. Curiously, although Arg and Lys have equivalent electropositive charges at neutral pH, α-defensins contain {{an average of}} nine Arg residues per Lys residue. To investigate the role of high α-defensin Arg content, all Arg residues in mouse Paneth cell α-defensin <b>cryptdin</b> 4 (Crp 4) and rhesus myeloid α-defensin 4 (RMAD- 4) were replaced with Lys to prepare (R/K) -Crp 4 and (R/K) -RMAD- 4, respectively. Lys-for-Arg replacements in Crp 4 attenuated bactericidal activity and slowed the kinetics of Escherichia coli ML 35 cell permeabilization, and (R/K) -Crp 4 required longer exposure times to reduce E. coli cell survival. In marked contrast, Lys substitutions in RMAD- 4 improved microbicidal activity against certain bacteria and permeabilized E. coli more effectively. Therefore, Arg→Lys substitutions attenuated activity in Crp 4 but not in RMAD- 4, and the functional consequences of Arg→Lys replacements in α-defensins are dependent on the peptide primary structure. In addition, the bactericidal effects of (R/K) -Crp 4 and (R/K) -RMAD- 4 were more sensitive to inhibition by NaCl {{than those of the}} native peptides, suggesting that the high Arg content of α-defensins may be under selection to confer superior microbicidal function under physiologic conditions...|$|E

The physiological role of TFF 2 in the protection of the GI tract was investigated in TFF 2 deficiency. Methods: TFF 2 -/- mice were generated and differential expression of various genes was assessed by using a mouse expression microarray, quantitative real time PCR, Northern blots or immunohistochemistry. Results: On an mRNA level we found 128 differentially expressed genes. We observed modulation of a number of crucial genes involved in innate and adaptive immunity in the TFF 2 -/- mice. Expression of proteasomal subunits genes (LMP 2, LMP 7 and PSMB 5) involved in the MHC class I presentation pathway were modulated indicating the formation of immunoproteasomes improving antigen presentation. Expression of one subunit of a transporter (TAP 1) responsible for importing degraded antigens into ER was increased, similarly to the BAG 2 gene that modulates chaperone activity in ER helping proper loading on MHC class I molecules. Several mouse defensin (<b>cryptdin)</b> genes coding important intestinal microbicidal proteins were up-regulated as a consequence of TFF 2 deficiency. Normally moderate expression of TFF 3 was highly increased in stomach...|$|E
40|$|Enteric α-defensins {{belong to}} a {{superfamily}} of antimicrobial peptides representing the humoral branch of innate immunity. They are produced by intestinal Paneth cells and play an irreplaceable role in the homeostasis of small intestine by modulation of its bacterial composition {{and the protection of}} intestinal stem cells residing in the intestinal crypts. Unexpectedly, the tissue-specific gene expression screening of enteric alpha-defensins on a panel of rat tissues revealed their presence in the thymus. The characterization of their cellular source pointed to the CD 45 - MHCII+ AIRE+ medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). The subsequent analysis further confirmed that, analogous to the rat model, mouse enteric α- defensins (<b>cryptdins)</b> are in the thymus expressed exclusively in the mTECs. It is now well established that autoimunne regulator (AIRE) -dependent transcription of peripheral tissue restricted antigens (TRAs) and their presentation by mTECs leads to a deletion of self- reactive thymocytes. This process of negative section represents the central mechanism of immunological tolerance. Predictably, mutations and malfunctioning of AIRE lead to aberrations in the negative selection, occurrence of self-reactive T-cells and subsequent production of autoantibodies against TRAs. Consistent with [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} on genetic susceptibility of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) has been tremendous and over 10 chromosomal regions {{have been identified}} by genome-wide scanning. Further fine mapping as well as candidate gene studies have already led to the identification {{of a number of}} susceptibility genes including CARD 15, DLG 5, OCTN 1 and 2, NOD 1, HLA, and TLR 4. The CARD 15 gene is undoubtedly replicated most widely and most understood at present. CARD 15 is involved in the recognition of bacterial peptidoglycan-derived muramyl dipeptide (MDP) and will stimulate secretion of antimicrobial peptides including alpha-defensins (also called <b>cryptdins)</b> to protect the host from invasion. Genetic research in IBD has advanced our understanding of the clinical heterogeneity of the disease and has started to tackle the complex interactions between genetic risk factors and environmental risk factors in IBD. Genes also interfere with the metabolization of drugs and may influence the clinical response and the drug-related toxicity. Interesting pharmacogenetic data with respect to steroids, azathioprine, and infliximab have been generated in IBD. Overall, it is anticipated that genetic markers in the future will be implemented in an integrated molecular diagnostic and prognostic approach of our patients. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Paneth cells at {{the base}} of small {{intestinal}} crypts secrete microbicidal -defensins, termed <b>cryptdins</b> (Crps) in mice, as mediators of innate immunity. Proteomic studies show that five abundant Paneth cell -defensins in C 57 BL/ 6 mice are strain specific in that they have not been identified in other inbred strains of mice. Two C 57 BL/ 6 -specific peptides are coded for by the Defcr 20 and- 21 genes evident in the NIH C 57 BL/ 6 genome but absent from the Celera mixed-strain assembly, which excludes C 57 BL/ 6 data and differs from the NIH build with respect to the organization of the -defensin gene locus. Conversely, C 57 BL/ 6 mice lack the Crp 1,- 2,- 4, and- 6 peptides and their corresponding Defcr 1,- 2,- 4, and- 6 genes, which are common to several mouse strains, including those of the Celera assembly. In C 57 BL/ 6 mice, -defensin gene diversification appears to have occurred by tandem duplication of a multigene cassette that was not found in the mixed-strain assembly. Both mouse genome assemblies contain conserved -defensin pseudogenes that are closely related to func-tional myeloid -defensin genes in the rat, suggesting that the neutrophil -defensin defect in mice resulted from progressive gene loss. Given the role of -defensins in shaping the composition of the enteric microflora, such polymorphisms may influence outcomes in mouse models of disease or infection. Mammalian -defensins are cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with microbicidal activities against many species o...|$|R
