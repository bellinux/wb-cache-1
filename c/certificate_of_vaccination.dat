40|$|Worldwide {{companion}} animals are being bred and traded. The line between {{legal and illegal}} breed and trade is a thin line. Breeders and traders act illegal when a license is missing, when the <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> are inaccurate or forged, {{when they do not}} meet the requirements of the European law concerning transport of living animals, or when the welfare of the animals is not to a certain standard. Especially this last point gives room for interpretation. Unfortunately there are no European laws concerning the welfare of animals in each Member State. This means that each country has its own legislation, or worse, no legislation at all. In this research the definition of illegal dog trade will become clear, as well as the trade of dogs within the European Union. There are several negative consequences of this illegal dog trade; not just in the field of the health, welfare and behavior of the dogs, but also for the consumer. Unfortunately, the European Commission has no legal base yet to act upon the field of animal welfare...|$|R

40|$|In 1980, the World Health Assembly {{declared}} the global eradication of smallpox and recommended the universal discontinuation of smallpox vaccination; nevertheless, it recommended that surveillance {{and research on}} orthopoxvirus infections should continue. By early 1982, all except 8 {{countries in the world}} had stopped routine vaccination programmes and all except 1 no longer required an international <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> smallpox <b>vaccination</b> for travellers. Since 1978, as a result of continuing active surveillance, 176 smallpox rumours have been investigated in 60 countries. Two of these concerned the two laboratory-associated cases that occurred in the United Kingdom in 1978; all the others were false alarms. Special surveillance programmes for human monkeypox have been developed in West and Central Africa. The number of laboratories retaining variola virus stocks has been reduced to four. Investigations to determine the identity and origin of the six known isolates of “whitepox” virus have continued. Research on mapping of variola DNA and on monoclonal antibodies against certain orthopoxvirus antigens is continuing. All these measures are aimed at ensuring that the achievement of smallpox eradication is permanent...|$|R

50|$|Publication of the Inquiry and the {{subsequent}} energetic promulgation by Jenner of the idea <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> with a virus other than variola virus constituted a watershed in the control of smallpox for which he, {{more than anyone else}} deserves the credit. As vaccination spread, some European countries made it compulsory. Concern about its safety led to opposition and then repeal of legislation in some instances. Compulsory infant vaccination was introduced in England by the 1853 Vaccination Act. By 1871, parents could be fined for non-compliance, and then imprisoned for non-payment. This intensified opposition, and the 1898 Vaccination Act introduced a conscience clause. This allowed exemption on production <b>of</b> a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> conscientious objection signed by two magistrates. Such certificates were not always easily obtained and a further Act in 1907 allowed exemption by a statutory declaration which could not be refused. Although theoretically still compulsory, the 1907 Act effectively marked the end <b>of</b> compulsory infant <b>vaccination</b> in England.|$|R
