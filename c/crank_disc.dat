50|$|Another form of {{rotary inlet}} valve used on {{two-stroke}} engines employs two cylindrical members with suitable cutouts arranged to rotate one within the other - the inlet pipe having {{passage to the}} crankcase only when the two cutouts coincide. The crankshaft itself may form one of the members, as in most glow plug model engines. In another embodiment, the <b>crank</b> <b>disc</b> is arranged to be a close-clearance fit in the crankcase, and is provided with a cutout which lines up with an inlet passage in the crankcase wall at the appropriate time, as in Vespa motor scooters.|$|E
40|$|A {{new engine}} design concept, {{characterized}} by a single cylinder-double piston and a cycloid crank rotor instead of the conventional crankshaft has been developed recently by Gul & Co Development AB, Sweden. The rotor (<b>crank</b> <b>disc)</b> is equipped with an oval groove {{in the shape of}} a sinusoidal cycloid according to the expression Y=S(-Sin(2 ) /(2 )) where S is the piston stroke and  varies from 0 to 1. Inside the oval groove a ball rolls/ slides in order to transfer force from the piston to the rotor. Such a rotor contains groove surfaces for the valve movement control as well. Each turn of the rotor corresponds to four strokes for both the pistons. Thus, a full 4 -stroke engine cycle is developed for a single nonconventional crankshaft revolution. Having the extra freedom to select an optimal piston movement, the new design is believed to have the potential to provide low emissions, low noise levels and lower fuel consumption. Therefore, it has been subjected to an engine thermodynamics simulation, to provide an insight to engine performance. Simulation results and preliminary laboratory tests have shown that the optimized cycloid crank rotor, which further intensifies the reduction of the piston speed close to both dead centers, gives better conditions for the combustion processes, and thus a higher efficiency. Since the single cylinder-double piston with cycloid crank rotor displays better performance and reduced size compared to conventional combustion engines, it is believed that this new patented Swedish engine will compete with conventional engines in lawn movers, chain saws, outboard motors and other engines in similar small-scaled equipment...|$|E

It received liquid cooling, {{a modified}} powervalve system with larger expansion bottle and valves, a heavier <b>crank,</b> dual <b>disc</b> brakes, heavier clutch springs and more plates, a newly modeled frame with a modern style linkage, KX125-based shock with 16 compression and 16 rebound adjustments, quick release access for rear wheel, large airbox, and a [...] fuel tank.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{positional}} accuracy of disc storing mechanism for benthic drill is {{the guarantee of}} long hole coring in deep sea. Aiming the lack of {{positional accuracy}} analysis on disc storing mechanism, the mathematic model of the positional accuracy for disc storing mechanism is presented by using complex vector and matrix analyzing method. The analytical formula of crank rotation positional accuracy is acquired through rotation positional analysis of <b>crank</b> in <b>disc</b> storing mechanism driven by hydraulic cylinder. Adopting numerical nonlinear iteration solution method of Newton-Simpson, the variation rule of rotation positional error for disc storing mechanism to cylinder length is acquired, which supports an important theory, leading to tolerance design for dimensional parameters of disc storing mechanism...|$|R
