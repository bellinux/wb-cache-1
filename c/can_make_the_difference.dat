5|$|Technology plays a very {{important}} role in the strategy of the game. As a civilization progresses through the ages, technology becomes more and more expensive, which makes collecting the necessary resources to research them difficult. As a consequence, balancing the workforce of villagers across the various resources <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between victory and defeat.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{there are}} no {{regulations}} at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground. A fence in foul territory that {{is close to the}} outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between a double and a triple or inside-the-park home run. The surface of the field is also unregulated. While the adjacent image shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually all MLB teams with naturally surfaced fields), teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare. Some fields—including several in MLB—use an artificial surface, such as AstroTurf. Surface variations can {{have a significant effect on}} how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning. Similarly, the presence of a roof (seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can greatly affect how fly balls are played. While football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized. The area out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does, so variations in that regard are largely insignificant.|$|E
25|$|When on the {{incorrect}} lead, {{the horse}} is usually left unbalanced. In this case, correct riding <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in the horse's performance. Good riding can keep the legs positioned correctly enough so that {{the horse is}} still able to perform the turn. Poor riding will hinder rather than help the horse, and in extreme situations such as a tight turn at speed, the horse may lose its legs footing and fall.|$|E
50|$|Lamination {{consists}} of small <b>differences</b> in <b>the</b> type of sediment that occur throughout the rock. They {{are caused by}} cyclic changes in the supply of sediment. These changes can occur in grain size, clay percentage, microfossil content, organic material content or mineral content and often result in pronounced differences in colour between <b>the</b> laminae. Weathering <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> even more clear.|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the paper is to {{illustrate}} {{the importance of a}} reliable service in the meanings of cloud computing. The dynamics of an organization shows us that porting customs applications in cloud <b>can</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> to be a successful company and to deliver what the client need just in time. Every employ should be able to access and enter data from everywhere. Remember that the office is moving along with the employ nowadays. But this concept comes with disadvantages of how safe is your data if you cannot control exactly, by your employs, those machines...|$|R
25|$|There {{are also}} {{striking}} regional variations in food security. Although food insecurity {{can be difficult}} to measure, 45% of elementary and secondary students in Maine qualify for free or reduced-price school lunch; by some measures Maine has been declared the most food-insecure of the New England states. Transportation challenges and distance are common barriers to families in rural areas who seek food assistance. Social stigma is another important consideration, and for children, sensitively administering in-school programs <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between success and failure. For instance, when John Woods, co-founder of Full Plates, Full Potential, learned that embarrassed students were shying away from the free breakfasts being distributed at a school he was working with, he made arrangements to provide breakfast free of charge to all of the students there.|$|E
500|$|After Ødegaard {{signed for}} Real Madrid, Norwegian former {{football}} scout Tor-Kristian Karlsen praised his mentality, stating {{that he had}} [...] "overcome every challenge in front of him". Karlsen called him [...] "so level-headed and mature" [...] and noted his intelligence and performance at school, while also saying {{that this could be}} a disadvantage as [...] "The best footballers tend to have a bit of needle, a bit of fire". While former Norway international Jan Åge Fjørtoft was supportive of the transfer to Real Madrid due to the opportunity to learn from Zidane, he warned that at the age of 16 he needed time to develop: [...] "Comparing Ødegaard to Messi is nonsense from the media. Messi is a player who <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> and Martin can do the same, but any comparisons should not be taken seriously". Ødegaard reacted to the attention on him by saying [...] "If you get carried away now, you won't get far in 10 years. I'm supposed to be at my best then, not now. That I know".|$|E
2500|$|Most {{maternal}} {{deaths are}} avoidable, as the health-care solutions {{to prevent or}} manage complications are well known. Improving access to antenatal care in pregnancy, skilled care during childbirth, and care and support {{in the weeks after}} childbirth will reduce maternal deaths significantly [...] It is particularly important that all births be attended by skilled health professionals, as timely management and treatment <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between life and death. To improve maternal health, barriers that limit access to quality maternal health services must be identified and addressed {{at all levels of the}} health [...] system. Recommendations for reducing maternal mortality include access to health care, access to family planning services, and emergency obstetric care, funding and intrapartum care. Reduction in unnecessary obstetric surgery has also been suggested.|$|E

2500|$|BDSM {{participants}} {{are expected to}} understand practical safety aspects. For instance, {{they are expected to}} recognize that parts of the body can be damaged, such as nerves and blood vessels by contusion, or that skin that can be scarred. Using crops, whips, or floggers, the top's fine motor skills and anatomical knowledge <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between a satisfying session for the bottom and a highly unpleasant experience that may even entail severe physical harm. The very broad range of BDSM [...] "toys" [...] and physical and psychological control techniques often requires a far-reaching knowledge of details related to the requirements of the individual session, such as anatomy, physics, and psychology. Despite these risks, BDSM activities usually result in far less severe injuries than sports like boxing and football, and BDSM practitioners do not visit emergency rooms any more often than the general population.|$|E
2500|$|As Body Farm {{research}} {{continues to}} evolve, [...] the {{researchers at the}} Anthropological Research Facility continue to identify new methods to calculate the postmortem interval, body identification, and any other variables that might aid criminal investigations. Time of death in a homicide case <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between bringing criminals to justice and a cold case. Therefore, {{this has been the}} main focus of the Body Farm since it was opened. With the progression of research, [...] Bass is hopeful that in the future, entomologists will be able to declare time of death within a half-day. What makes this a difficult task to accomplish is that every minute that passes after death, the range of time they can correctly estimate time of death is broadened dramatically. The Body Farm's success over the past 36 years is directly responsible for a vast amount of the overwhelming progress in narrowing that range. When asked about the growth of the Body Farm in the future, [...] Bass insinuated that the Body Farm is too small right now and a higher percentage of land area that has not been contaminated by other burials is needed for future achievements. [...] Bass has proposed the need for more territory to the University of Tennessee, and the university has granted the ARF at least [...] in addition the original [...] lot.|$|E
