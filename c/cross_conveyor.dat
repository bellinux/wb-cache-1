The wagon includes a material receiving box having a first conveyor therein for conveying the material towards one end thereof. A <b>cross</b> <b>conveyor</b> is mounted at the {{one end of the}} box for conveying the material outwardly from the box through the lower end of a discharge opening formed {{in the side of the}} box. A material beater means is rotatably mounted in the box above the <b>cross</b> <b>conveyor.</b> The safety door extends across the discharge opening to prevent the operator from reaching inwardly through the discharge opening. The safety door is self-closing and is opened by the material being discharged outwardly through the discharge opening...|$|E
40|$|Boiler heating {{surfaces}} {{consists of}} so-called tube panels (weld-jointed tubes with intermediate webs), {{which can be}} in this case up to 20 m long and weigh up to 700 kg. The main manufacturing processes are milling, grinding and assembly by welding of the tubes. The mechanized and manual handling and transport operations involved were subjecting the operators to great strain through impact noise and physical exertion. The highest sound levels were generated by the dumping of the tube into two collecting pockets, and amounted to 111 dB(A) at the workplaces. Further main noise sources were the collision of the tubes on the <b>cross</b> <b>conveyor,</b> {{the separation of the}} individual tubes and the transfer to and from roller tables as well as the turnover of the tube panels abaout their longitudinal axis. The noise sources, their significance as well as the factors affecting sound radiation have been determined on the basis of noise measurements in the initial condition. Design measures have made it possible to substantially reduce the greatest part of impact noises. The measures implemented include completely new designs, e. g. two low-noise collecting pockets, a <b>cross</b> <b>conveyor</b> with controlled material displacement and the turnover device as well as numerous modifications of existing equipment units in the form of additional lifting and lowering elements, altered level positions, sound-damping coverings, reduced speeds, interventions in the sequencing control and the like. It was thus possible to fully elemeinate the previous strian and exposure to danger of the operating personnel in manual tumover as well as the risk of injury during turnover by crane of three- and seventube panels. The solutions adopted have been previously tested in path in experimental plants and optimized. Unsuccessful approaches to a solution are also convered by the report. (orig.) Kesselheizflaechen sind zusammengesetzt aus sogenannten Rohrbrettern (ueber Zwischenstege miteinander verschweisste Rohre), die im vorliegenden Fall bis zu 20 m lang und 700 kg schwer sein koennen. Die hauptsaechlichen Fertigungsvorgaenge sind das Fraesen, Schleifen und Verschweissen der Rohre. Durch die damit verbundenen mechanisierten und manuellen Handhabungs- und Transportvorgaenge waren die Arbeitnehmer grossen Belastungen durch Schlaggeraeusche und koerperliche Anstrengung ausgesetzt. Die hoechsten Schallpegel wurden durch das Abwerfen der Rohre in zwei Sammelmulden verursacht und betrugen 111 dB(A) an den Arbeitsplaetzen. Weitere Hauptlaermquellen waren das Aneinanderschlagen der Rohre auf dem Quertransport, das Vereinzeln und das Uebergeben in bzw. aus den Rollgaengen sowie das Wenden von Rohrbrettern um ihre Laengsachse. Ausgehend von Geraeuschmessungen im Ausgangszustand wurden die Geraeuschquellen, deren Wertigkeiten sowie die Einflussgroessen auf die Schallabstrahlung festgestellt. Durch konstruktive Massnahmen konnte der groesste Teil der Schlaggeraeusche stark verringert werden. Zu den realisierten Massnahmen gehoeren vollstaendge Neukonstruktionen, wie zwei laermarme Sammelmulden, ein Quertransport mit kontrollierter Materialbewegung und die Wendevorrichtung sowie zahlreiche Aenderungen an den vorhandenen Konstruktionen in Form von zusaetzlichen Hub/Senkelementen, geaendertern Hebenstellungen, schalldaempfende Belaege, reduzierte Geschwindigkeiten, Eingriffe in die Ablaufsteuerung und dgl. Die urspruengliche Belastung und Gefaehrdung des Bedienungspersonals beim manuellen Wenden sowie das Verletzungsrisiko beim Wenden per Kran konnte bei 3 er- und 7 er-Rohrbrettern vollstaendig abgebaut werden. Die gewaehlten Loesungen wurden vorher z. T. an Versuchsanlagen erprobt und optimiert. Berichtet wird auch ueber Loesungsansaetze, die nicht zum Erfolg fuehrten. (orig.)

5|$|On {{a garden}} scale, the berries should be picked when dry and ripe. Commercially, most {{harvesting}} is done mechanically by straddle harvesters. These move continually down the rows, straddling {{a row of}} bushes, shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit.

40|$|Abstract: This work is {{concerned}} with the development of a signal processing algorithm for checkweighers to realize much higher speed of operation and highly accurate measurement of mass of object during <b>crossing</b> a <b>conveyor</b> belt. Continuous measurement means that masses of discrete objects on a conveyor belt are determined in sequence. Checkweighers usually have maximum capacities of less than 75 kg and achieve measuring rates of 150 packages per minute and more. The output signals from the checkweighers are always contaminated with noises due to vibrations of the conveyor belt and the object in motion. In this paper an employed digital filter is of Finite-duration Impulse Response (FIR) type that can be designed under the consideration on the dynamics of checkweighers. The experimental results on checkweighers suggest that the filtering algorithm proposed in this paper is effective enough to practical applications...|$|R
50|$|The {{screen layout}} is clearly {{influenced}} by early platform game Space Panic, set {{out as a}} series of platforms and ladders populated by enemy 'gremlins' which also bear more than a passing resemblance to the Space Panic monsters. This is the factory of the title. The player takes the role of Felix, a factory worker, whose job is to ensure the generator, in the bottom right of the screen, does not run out of oil. Felix begins at the generator and must <b>cross</b> the <b>conveyor</b> belt, jumping over parcels (in gameplay similar to Donkey Kong). If Felix fails to jump the parcel, he falls down and is carried along the belt for a short while. If he has time to stand up, he can continue on as normal but if he reaches the end of the belt, he loses a life.|$|R

40|$|Today {{much higher}} speed of {{operation}} and highly accurate weighing of packages during <b>crossing</b> a <b>conveyor</b> belt has been {{getting more and more}} important in the food and distribution industries etc. Continuous weighing means that masses of discrete packages on a conveyor belt are automatically determined in sequence. Making the best use of new weighing scale called a multi-stage conveyor belt scale which can be created so as to adjust the conveyor belt length to the product length, we propose a simplified and effective mass estimation algorithm under practical vibration modes. Conveyor belt scales usually have maximum capacities of less than 80 kg and 140 cm, and achieve measuring rates of 150 packages per minute and more. The output signals from the conveyor belt scales are always contaminated with noises due to vibrations of the conveyor belt and the product in motion. In this paper an employed digital filter is of Finite-duration Impulse Response (FIR) type designed under the consideration on the dynamics of conveyor belt scales. The experimental results on conveyor belt scales suggest that the filtering algorithm proposed here is effective enough to practical applications. 1...|$|R
50|$|After <b>crossing</b> the <b>conveyor</b> belt, Felix {{can climb}} {{into the rest of}} the factory which {{contains}} a number of randomly placed items which can be picked up and used {{as well as a number}} of enemies. The main enemies are the various gremlins that patrol the platforms. If they come into contact with Felix, they knock him off the platform and a life is lost. The other hazard is a giant rat which occasionally runs across the screen, again knocking Felix off the platform (although unlike the gremlins, it can be jumped). Felix can collect a pitchfork which lets him run at the gremlins and knock them from the platforms. This only lasts for a brief time (like the axe in Donkey Kong). There is also a bag of rat poison which can be collected and then laid down on a platform in the hope that the rat will run across that platform. Finally, Felix can collect an oil can which he must take back to the generator. If the can is dropped (by running into a wall or falling on the conveyor belt), it spills and he must return for another can. Only one item can be carried at a time.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{an episode of}} a stratospheric intrusion into the free troposphere over Europe followed by a long-range transport of ozone from the North American boundary layer. Observational data showed {{the presence of a}} thin tongue of stratospheric air in the free troposphere for at least 36 hours. This filament was found in data from two ozone soundings and was recorded continuously for 26 hours by a high-resolution ozone lidar. The stratospheric air also intercepted two high Alpine summits, causing elevated ozone and beryllium 7 concentrations. Trajectory, particle dispersion model, and potential vorticity analyses confirmed the stratospheric nature of the tongue. In the lidar data, following the intrusion, pockets of elevated ozone concentrations (80 - 100 ppb) were found in the free troposphere close to the tropopause. The low potential vorticity values and high water vapor content in these ozone-rich pockets and trajectory analyses suggest that the ozone was photochemically produced in the boundary layer over eastern North America, followed by rapid uplifting in a warm conveyor belt over the Atlantic Ocean ahead of a frontal system. This was confirmed by ozone and water vapor measurements aboard commercial airliners <b>crossing</b> the warm <b>conveyor</b> belt. The air mass trajectories in both the stratospheric intrusion and the warm conveyor belt were tightly bundled, emphasizing the importance of the coherency of airstreams for long-range ozone transport...|$|R
