5|$|In 1990, the IRS seized most of Nelson's assets, {{claiming}} that he owed US$32,000,000.

In 1978, after he fired Reshen, Nelson was introduced by Dallas lawyer Terry Bray to the accounting firm Price Waterhouse. To repay the debt Reshen had <b>created</b> <b>with</b> the IRS, Nelson was recommended to invest in tax shelters that ultimately flopped.
