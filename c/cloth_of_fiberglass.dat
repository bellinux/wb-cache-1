40|$|The article {{presents}} the research results of mathematical models of bending concrete elements reinforced with prestressed fiberglass reinforcement. The investigations {{are built on}} the basic positions of the nonlinear deformation model, {{taking into account the}} nonlinear work of concrete. The samples were calculated with consideration for the deformation diagrams of materials obtained experimentally using the Lira CAD 2014 software package. The article also covers the current practice <b>of</b> using <b>fiberglass</b> to reinforce concrete bearing structures without prestressing, as well as the current normative documents regulating the use <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> reinforcement in the Russian Federation, regulatory and state standards containing information on the strength and deformation properties <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> reinforcement, and the results of physical tests <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> reinforcement for tension. Based on the results of the study, we performed the analysis <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> reinforcement use with and without prestressing. The studies presented in the article show that the use <b>of</b> pre-stressed <b>fiberglass</b> reinforcement makes it possible to increase the rigidity and fracture toughness of bending concrete elements...|$|R

50|$|Finally, {{the last}} Champs of 1963-64 {{were among the}} first American trucks — if not the first — to offer service bodies {{constructed}} <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass.</b> Today, such bodies made <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> and composites are still gaining acceptance, with the steel service body remaining the norm.|$|R
50|$|The car's {{body was}} {{built at the}} factory and {{featured}} an unusual form <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> construction. Instead <b>of</b> a single layer <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass,</b> as is common in other kit cars, the Bernardi body tub (the portion between the passenger compartment and the frame or road) and other body components used a composite sandwich consisting of one layer <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass,</b> one <b>of</b> stiff plastic foam, and finally a second layer <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass.</b> The result is a heavier body than usual for kit cars, but one with reputedly greater stiffness and sound absorption than the single-layer approach. The colors for the visible {{parts of the body}} are molded into the fiberglass body parts as Gelcoat and the cars often appear with two-tone color schemes where the body color contrasts with the fenders and running boards.|$|R

50|$|The Bell Boy Boat Company was a {{division}} of the Bellingham Shipyards Co. of Bellingham, Washington set up by the shipyard owner Arch Talbot in 1952. Talbot was interested in creating a line <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> boats, having worked with the material when the shipyard created of line of lifeboats for minesweepers in the Korean War called wherries. The company's use <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> was pioneering; the material, despite having its commercial introduction in the 1930s, had seen limited use or interest until the postwar period. The Bell Boy line of boats, during the 1950s and 1960s, were considered {{to be one of the}} earliest types <b>of</b> <b>fiberglass</b> boats.|$|R
