40|$|In recent years, {{innovative}} vibro-modulation {{technique has}} been introduced for detection of <b>contact-type</b> interfaces such as cracks, debondings, and delaminations. The technique utilizes the effect of nonlinear interaction of ultrasound and vibrations at the interface of the defect. Vibration varies on the contact area of the interface modulating passing through ultrasonic wave. The modulation manifests itself as additional side-band spectral components with the combination frequencies in the spectrum of the received signal. The presence of these components allows for detection and differentiation of the <b>contact-type</b> defects from other structural and material inhomogeneities. Vibro-modulation technique has been implemented in N-SCAN ® damage detection system. The system consists of a digital synthesizer, high and low frequency amplifiers, a magnetostrictive shaker, ultrasonic transducers and a PC-based data acquisition/processing station with N-SCAN ® software.

40|$|The R-test is an {{instrument}} to measure three-dimensional displacement of a precision sphere attached to a spindle relative to a work table by using three displacement sensors. Its application to error calibration for five-axis machine tools has been studied in both academia and industry. For the simplicity in calculating the sphere center displacement, all conventional R-test devices use <b>contact-type</b> displacement sensors with a flat-ended probe. Conventional <b>contact-type</b> R-test may be potentially subject {{to the influence of}} the friction or the dynamics of supporting spring in displacement sensors particularly in dynamic measurement.

First, a new algorithm is proposed to calculate the three-dimensional displacement of sphere center by using non-contact displacement sensors. The compensation of measurement error of a laser displacement sensor due to the curvature of target sphere is incorporated. Then, the measurement uncertainty of four laser displacement sensors with different measuring principles is experimentally investigated in measuring the geometry of a sphere in order to select the laser displacement sensor most suitable for the application to a non-contact R-test.

The residual material properties of 116 cylindrical concrete samples with various mix proportions and subjected to various heating temperatures were measured by a destructive method, and their nonlinearity parameters were measured by two nonlinear ultrasonic methods.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a non-contact optical measuring approach {{by which to}} measure the three-dimensional (3 D) shape of a transparent object such as a glass panel or an acrylic plate. In conventional approaches to obtain the 3 D shape of a transparent object, <b>contact-type</b> sensors have been widely used.

In this paper, we propose a novel triangulation-based rangefinding approach that {{can be applied to the}} 3 D shape of a transparent object or to an opaque object. The rangefinder is based on the fact that the light projected onto the surface of a transparent object is in part reflected by the surface, though the majority of the projected light is transmitted through the surface. From the experimental results, the proposed rangefinding approach has the advantage that it can easily measure the 3 D-shape of an object if the object reflects or transmits light, depending on its location. As a result, we conclude that the proposed approach has great potential for a wide range of industrial applications. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background For over 30 years {{potentials}} of mean force {{have been}} used to evaluate the relative energy of protein structures. The most commonly used potentials define the energy of residue-residue interactions and are derived from the empirical analysis of the known protein structures. However, single-body residue 'environment' potentials, although widely used in protein structure analysis, have not been rigorously compared to these classical two-body residue-residue interaction potentials. Here we do not try to combine the two different types of residue interaction potential, but rather to assess their independent contribution to scoring protein structures. Results A data set of nearly three thousand monomers was used to compare pairwise residue-residue 'contact-type' propensities to single-body residue 'contact-count' propensities. Using a large and standard set of protein decoys we performed an in-depth comparison of these two types of residue interaction propensities. The scores derived from the <b>contact-type</b> and contact-count propensities were assessed using two different performance metrics and were compared using 90 different definitions of residue-residue contact. Our findings show that both types of score perform equally well on the task of discriminating between near-native protein decoys. However, in a statistical sense, the contact-count based scores were found to carry more information than the <b>contact-type</b> based scores. Conclusion Our analysis has shown that the performance of either type of score is very similar on a range of different decoys. This similarity suggests a common underlying biophysical principle for both types of residue interaction propensity. However, several features of the contact-count based propensity suggests that it should be used in preference to the <b>contact-type</b> based propensity. Specifically, {{it has been shown that}} contact-counts can be predicted from sequence information alone. In addition, the use of a single-body term allows for efficient alignment strategies using dynamic programming, which is useful for fold recognition, for example. These facts, combined with the relative simplicity of the contact-count propensity, suggests that contact-counts should be studied in more detail in the future. </p...|$|E

30|$|An {{increase}} in <b>contact-type</b> defects within fire-damaged concrete {{results in the}} degradation of mechanical properties including stiffness and strength. Among the nondestructive methods, ultrasonic measurement methods demonstrate high potential and are applicable for evaluating damaged concrete (Dilek 2007; Dilek and Leming 2007; Ham and Oh 2013). These methods {{can be divided into}} two categories depending on the measurement techniques and target defects: linear and nonlinear ultrasonic methods. Linear ultrasonic methods, which measure wave velocity, wave attenuation, and impact echo, are conventional ultrasonic methods and have been widely used to evaluate damaged concrete, particularly fire-damaged concrete (Chaix et al. 2003; Colombo and Felicetti 2007; Dilek and Leming 2007; Epasto et al. 2010; Kee and Nam 2015; Yang et al. 2009). However, these linear methods exhibit lower sensitivity to distributed defects and <b>contact-type</b> defects at the micro-scale (Jhang 2009; Park et al. 2015) compared to nonlinear ultrasonic methods, which are more sensitive to early-stage micro-scale defects as these defects cause nonlinear behavior of an incident wave (Zaitsev et al. 2006). To investigate this phenomenon in concrete, Chen et al. (2010) performed an experiment to characterize micro-scale defects induced by an alkali-silica reaction by using a nonlinear impact resonance acoustic spectroscopy technique. In addition, Payan et al. (2007) conducted nonlinear resonant ultrasound spectroscopy to assess the damage to concrete caused by exposure to high temperatures. Moreover, recently, defects in fire-damaged concrete with various mix proportions and under various temperature scenarios have been evaluated by various nonlinear ultrasonic methods (Park et al. 2015; Yim et al. 2014).|$|E

The degree of unresponsiveness has been tested by exposing hapten-fed animals to intense haptenic stimulation. Animals of groups that were demonstrably unresponsive to picryl chloride {{could be made to}} form hapten-specific antibody by injecting picrylated bovine gamma globulin. Specific anaphylactic-type antibodies, presumably 7 S γ 1, were synthesized, and in animals given PBGG adsorbed to alumina there arose a measurable concentration of precipitating antibody, presumably 7 S γ 2, perhaps slightly earlier than in similarly treated control animals. Attempts to impose <b>contact-type</b> reactivity on such unresponsive animals met with limited success. Injection of picrylated guinea pig erythrocyte stromata in a complete Freund's adjuvant, with subsequent applications of picryl chloride to the dermis, led to definite contact sensitivity to 0. 3 per cent picryl chloride, whereas parallel treatment of normal control animals induced sensitivity to 0. 006 or 0. 002 per cent. By this double method of stimulation, hapten-fed animals did not advance in sensitivity by reason of the secondary dermal applications of the simple chemical, whereas control animals developed increasingly higher sensitivity by these contacts {{in what appeared to be}} a stepwise manner.
