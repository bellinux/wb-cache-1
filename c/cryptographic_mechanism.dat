Its application programming interface (API) provides security services of various symmetric and asymmetric <b>cryptographic</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Nevertheless, these services {{can be used in}} an uniform and convenient way achieved by means of object oriented techniques such as inheritance and overloading.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we extend a well known ad hoc {{geographical}} routing protocol, namely the GPSR, with a distributed and weighted clustering algorithm. The objectives are to protect GPSR from malicious intruders {{and also to}} optimize the GPSR performance and scalability. In the clustered GPSR the geographical routing decisions involve both the elected cluster heads and the simple ad hoc nodes. The proposed protocol protects the ad hoc network by applying both cryptographic and non <b>cryptographic</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in order to detect and isolate the malicious intruders that try to bias the cluster head selection procedure. The non <b>cryptographic</b> <b>mechanisms</b> include a distributed cooperative voting procedure and a monitoring block that introduces discrete consistency thresholds in the attack detection procedure.

Steganography {{is often}} {{combined}} with <b>cryptographic</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> This enhances steganography by valuable properties that are originally left to cryptographic systems. However, new problems for <b>cryptographic</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{arise from the}} context of steganography.

Comparably to cryptography, steganography evolves in an iterative process of designing and breaking new methods. In this paper we examine the encoding properties and cryptographic functionality of steganographic tools to enable the detection of embedded information in steganograms even if the embedding part was otherwise secure. ...|$|R

30|$|Cryptography is a {{fundamental}} part of any modern computing system, but unlikely to be the weakest component in its attack surface. Networking protocols, input parsing routines and even interface code with <b>cryptographic</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are components {{much more likely to}} be vulnerable to exploitation.

For example, violations of confidentiality may cause massive data breaches involving sensitive information. Adversarial interference on communication integrity may allow command injection attacks that deviate from the specified behavior. Availability is crucial to keep the system accessible by legitimate users and to guarantee continuous service provisioning, thus <b>cryptographic</b> <b>mechanisms</b> must also be lightweight to minimize potential for abuse by attackers.|$|R
