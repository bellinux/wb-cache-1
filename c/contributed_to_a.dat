5|$|Although Enron's {{compensation}} and performance management system {{was designed to}} retain and reward its most valuable employees, the system <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dysfunctional corporate culture that became obsessed with short-term earnings to maximize bonuses. Employees constantly tried to start deals, often disregarding the quality of cash flow or profits, {{in order to get}} a better rating for their performance review. Additionally, accounting results were recorded as soon as possible to keep up with the company's stock price. This practice helped ensure deal-makers and executives received large cash bonuses and stock options.|$|E
5|$|Aluminum {{production}}, shipbuilding, {{and nuclear}} {{production at the}} Hanford site <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> rapid increase in regional demand for electricity.

5|$|Both the St. Louis German and Irish {{communities}} urged neutrality at the 1914 {{outbreak of}} World War I, which <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> resurgent nativism after U.S. {{entry into the}} war in 1917. As a result, German St. Louisans suffered some discrimination during the war, and St. Louisans repressed elements of German culture. Commerce was not dramatically affected by the war. However, leading up to and before World War I, the population started to decrease as men were needed {{to work at the}} artillery plants and factories that were closer to the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|By September6, {{farmers in}} {{southern}} {{areas of the}} country requested aid from the government. In South Jeolla Province, ₩35billion (US$31.1million) was allocated for post-storm recovery. Of this, about half went to repairing public facilities. Across the province, repairs were expected to be completed by October or November 2012. On September11, the Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister announced that residents severely affected by the typhoon were eligible for up to ₩50million (US$44,000) in construction assistance. Economically, Typhoons Bolaven and Tembin <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 6.6% decrease in construction investment, the largest drop since January 2003.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, {{the army}} air base was {{reactivated}} as Amarillo Air Force Base and expanded {{to accommodate a}} Strategic Air Command B-52 Stratofortress wing.

However, the closure of Amarillo Air Force Base on December 31, 1968, <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> decrease in population to 127,010 by 1970.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, a {{religious}} movement called Allah Koura {{began in the}} San Cercle based upon the visions of a single person. Local administrators allowed the Allah Koura movement to spread and practice, seeing it as a potential limiting influence on the spread of Islam farther south. In the late 1950s, Muslim protests and riots throughout the colony further <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> growing independence movement.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Newfoundland pony {{was used}} for ploughing, {{assisting}} with gardens, hauling kelp from the beaches, gathering hay, and carrying wood, and they were also used for transportation. They were successfully used and bred to withstand the hard climate, and by 1935 there were over 9,000 ponies on the island. During the mid-20th century, however, increasing mechanization and a ban on free-roaming ponies <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> decline in the population, and increased exports to France for horse meat in the 1970s almost led to the extinction of the breed.|$|E
