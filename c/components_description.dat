Generalized phase-modulation ellipsometry combined with zone averaging enables precise characterization of samples with generalized anisotropy including anisotropic thin films with general axis orientation, liquid crystals, gratings, and anisotropic nanostructures.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to present the results of {{research}} into component based software development by providing a specification mechanism allowing searching for components in a component repository. A new component classification framework is proposed based on which a <b>Component</b> <b>Description</b> Manager has been designed and implemented. The classification framework combines domain knowledge, ontological information and some semantics to allow <b>descriptions</b> of <b>components</b> to be constructed in a consistent, yet informative way. The <b>Component</b> <b>Description</b> Manager consists of the classification framework and a repository of <b>component</b> <b>descriptions</b> constructed using this framework.

In CBSD, the {{possible}} benefits of COTS software development, such as low cost, low risk, and high quality, cannot be satisfactorily achieved due to inadequate and/or incomplete proposals for component specification.

40|$|A novel {{background}} generation method {{based on}} nonparametric background model is presented for background subtraction. We {{introduce a new}} model, named as effect <b>components</b> <b>description</b> (ECD), to model the variation of the background, by which we can relate the best estimate of the background to the modes (local maxima) of the underlying distribution. Based on ECD, an effective background generation method, most reliable background mode (MRBM), is developed. The basic computational module of the method is an old pattern recognition procedure, the mean shift, {{which can be used}} recursively to find the nearest stationary point of the underlying density function. The advantages of this method are three-fold: first, backgrounds can be generated from image sequence with cluttered moving objects; second, backgrounds are very clear without blur effect; third, it is robust to noise and small vibration. Extensive experimental results illustrate its good performance...|$|E

40|$|<b>Component</b> <b>Description</b> Language (CDL 1) is a {{language}} used for describing the interface {{and behavior of}} software components. CDL {{is an extension of}} the Object Management Group's Object Constraint Language (OCL). While OCL is only able to describe safety properties of a component and its features, CDL can also describe progress properties with temporal operators like next and leads-to. CDL also introduces several new "convenience" constructs that help simplify and clarify complex <b>component</b> <b>descriptions.</b> CDL can be used to specify a component's simple behavioral interface, as in Meyer's Design by Contract, the more complex temporal properties that distributed objects and components exhibit, and more. 1 Introduction Specification languages are used to describe a variety of entities, programmatic or otherwise.

40|$|The {{software}} engineering discipline {{is experiencing a}} quick consolidation in the applications development activities {{and the use of}} technologies and methodologies of web-based programming. In the web services arena some oriented and based practices for the construction of large scale software applications (i. e., distributed information systems) are beginning to appear. The software development practices based on web services composition (many of them elaborated by third parts) involve similar problems to those in the component-based development arena (more extended in the COTS components), like components ’ compatibility or interoperability. In the present work, it is carried out a comparative study between the traditional software <b>components</b> <b>description</b> and the web services description language (WSDL).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} work on {{the establishment}} of a virtual laboratories network, based on the concept of Virtual Closet that will contain all the elements and parts required to build the different experiences available in a vlabs network (that we call Euronet-Lab). To build this complex network it is necessary to find an adequate support. The large database of v-labs and independent elements that can integrate this structure allows the “recycling” of elements for purposes diverse from those they were originally created. This means to “re-use” the same element several times in different scenarios. In order to do this, it is necessary to have a structure that allows multiple instances of the same component. This paper will discuss the ontology essential to the establishment of such a network in order to standardize concepts and create uniform <b>components</b> <b>description</b> that supports the interaction between heterogeneous systems using shared parts or circuits.
