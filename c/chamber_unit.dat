Diffusive oxygen uptake and nutrient flux data were obtained using two interchangeable modules — a profiling oxygen micro-electrode unit and a benthic <b>chamber</b> <b>unit.</b> Diffusive O 2 uptake across the sediment–water interface and the O 2 penetration depths within the sediment were determined from the oxygen micro-profiles.

The deeper site had greater oxygen penetration depths (80 mm) but a lower diffusive oxygen uptake of 0. 6 mmol m? 2 d? 1, indicative possibly of little or no phyto-detrital input. Visual observations of retrieved sediment cores support this conclusion, however Site A has also displays generally lower organic content and lower macrobenthic biomass which may contribute to this observation. Nutrient pore water profile data indicated fluxes of nitrate of 0. 161 mmol m? 2 d? 1 and phosphate 0. 0008 mmol m? 2 d? 1 into the overlying water.

40|$|The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) {{needs to}} enhance its {{capabilities}} for safeguarding {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) stored in dry cask storage facilities and for maintaining persistent continuity of knowledge (CoK) about it. The current safeguards approach relies heavily upon containment and surveillance measures, where seals are placed {{inside and outside the}} dry cask. The disadvantage of this approach is that, if a seal is broken, no method currently exists to verify the dry cask content other than opening it and checking the internal seal and the SNF inside. This is a costly and difficult activity. Thus other measures need to be developed. This study focused on the development of a remote monitoring system (RMS) for dry cask storage which is capable of detecting neutron and gamma radiation emitted by the SNF and the signal thus generated can then be continually transmitted to the IAEA to maintain the CoK about the dry cask content. The remote option was chosen after reviewing the current IAEA needs. A computational approach was used to develop the proposed RMS. Monte Carlo N-Particle transport code (MCNP) was employed to develop a dry cask model with 32 SNF assemblies inside. The ORIGEN-ARP, fuel burn-up and depletion code, was used to generate a radiation source-term. A series of MCNP simulations were performed to investigate the neutron and gamma flux behavior inside the dry cask. The results of these simulations aided the design of the RMS and determination of the optimal location for its components. The RMS was placed inside the dry cask {{on the top of the}} multi-purpose canister (MPC). The final conceptual design of the RMS included two fission chambers (to detect neutrons) and one ionization chamber (to detect gamma radiation) enclosed in a polyethylene box with a thin cadmium plate inside, so the sequence of layers starting from the MPC lid was: polyethylene bottom layer, cadmium plate, chambers enclosed in polyethylene and polyethylene layer on top. Such configuration provided a suppression effect for thermal neutron flux coming from the bottom SNF assemblies and made system more sensitive to the opening of the dry cask lid and removal of SNF assemblies from the peripheral MPC cells. The proposed RMS design was tested through diversion analysis. The fission <b>chamber</b> <b>unit</b> design was successfully able to detect all the SNF diversion scenarios studied. The ionization chambers were able to detect only removal of SNF assemblies located just below it. However, the ionization chamber was found to be able to identify the opening of the dry cask lid through reduction in signal whenever the lid was opened. Therefore, the ionization chamber was kept in the RMS design to provide secondary confirmation for the detection of dry cask lid opening...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Total Artificial Hearts (TAHs) act as {{a bridge}} to {{transplantation}} or destination therapy for patients with terminal heart insufficiency. Recirculation areas are prone to thrombus formation, especially for long-term applications. Therefore, inadequate pump washout results in excessive thromboembolic risk. In this study the TAH ReinHeart, a double chamber membrane pump actuated by pusher plates, is investigated. The rotational orientation of the bileaflet mechanical heart valve (MHV) at the inflow has {{a significant effect on}} the flow pattern within the pump volume during each pump cycle. Therefore, it is expected that the washout is also sensitive to the rotational orientation of the MHV. In order to determine optimal valve orientation regarding the washout of the volume a numerical two-phase Fluid-Structure-Interaction (FSI) model was developed. Materials & Methods: Complex membrane kinematics necessitated fully coupled 3 D FSI simulations to accurately predict the pumping process. A commercial partitioned block-GaussâSeidel coupling package was used. In order to achieve coupling stability (âartificial added mass effectâ), the interface artificial compressibility method was applied. The augmented Lagrange formulation was used to enforce the frictional contact conditions between the structural contact pairs. To maintain mesh quality and to prevent inversion of fluid elements in regions of large deformation, the mesh stiffness of the fluid elements was defined as a function of mesh properties. The preload was applied to the fluid inlet by using a fixed pressure opening, whereas the systolic afterload at the fluid outlet was modeled by combining a fixed relative pressure opening and a fluid resistance based on the DarcyâWeisbach equation. Independence tests were performed for the structural and the fluid mesh as well as the time step size and the number of pulse cycles. Validation of the FSI model was performed using stereo Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements and high-speed recordings of the actual pump. In order to investigate the washout of the old blood by the new blood a homogeneous, immiscible two-phase flow model was used. The same non-Newtonian blood model was applied for both phases. Initially, the whole chamber was filled with fluid 1 (old blood). Several heart cycles with only fluid 1 entering the volume were simulated until pulse cycle independence was reached. Subsequently, fluid 2 (new blood) with a volume fraction of 1 was defined at the inlet. Four TAH geometries with 0 Â°, 45 Â°, 90 Â° and 135 Â° inlet valve orientation were created, where 0 Â° means that the MHV is oriented vertical to the chamber ceiling. The outlet valve was kept in the same orientation (0 Â°). The two-phase FSI model is currently applied to all geometries. Results: The flow fields and membrane motion correspond well with the PIV measurements and high-speed recordings, respectively For all valve orientations, at least three heart cycles were necessary to achieve adequate washout of the pump chamber volume. The remaining volume of fluid 1 in the chamber after three heart cycles was 0. 12 % and 0. 48 % for 0 Â° and 90 Â°, respectively. Remains of old blood can be observed mainly {{in the corner of the}} membrane and the housing opposite the inlet and outlet where velocities are low. Furthermore, washout quarter-time and washout half-time are currently compared for all geometries. Conclusions: The numerical two-phase Fluid-Structure-Interaction model was developed and is currently applied to investigate chamber washout of a Total Artificial Heart. Four geometries with different rotational orientations of the inlet MHV were created and are compared regarding washout efficiency. First results of this approach are promising concerning the detection of stagnant blood areas. Besides valve orientation, different heart valve types and chamber designs could be evaluated and compared in order to reduce the potential for thrombus formation. Furthermore, based on the washout efficiency as well as estimated stresses a design optimization of the <b>chamber</b> <b>unit,</b> pusher plate and membrane is possible...|$|E

ParticipantsMembers of professional practice organizations who reported using EtO or HPGP {{in the past week}} to sterilize medical instruments and supplies. Participating organizations invited members via email which included a hyperlink to the survey. MethodsDescriptive analyses were conducted including simple frequencies and prevalences. ResultsA total of 428 respondents completed the module on chemical sterilants. Because most respondents worked in hospitals (87 %, n= 373) analysis focused on these workers. Most used HPGP sterilizers (84 %, n= 373), 38 % used EtO sterilizers, with 22 % using both. Nearly all respondents using EtO operated single <b>chamber</b> <b>units</b> (94 %, n= 120); most of them reported that the units employed single use cartridges (83 %, n= 115). Examples of where engineering and administrative controls were lacking for EtO include: operational local exhaust ventilation (7 %; n= 114); continuous air monitoring (6 %; n= 113); safe handling training (6 %; n= 142); and standard operating procedures (4 %; n= 142). Examples of practices which may increase HPGP exposure risk included lack of standard operating procedures (9 %; n= 311) and safe handling training (8 %; n= 312). ConclusionsUse of precautionary practices was good but not universal. EtO use appears to have diminished in favor of HPGP which affords higher throughput and minimal regulatory constraints.

When used, the ionization chamber would be inserted into a yellow anti-contamination bag, tied off, and hung outside a bomb shelter to measure radioactivity levels from a safe distance. An extension coaxial cord, typically stored inside the unit, is then run from the outdoor chamber to the indoor meter. The coaxial spool is used to prop the meter up for reading. This would allow those hiding to wait until outside radiation levels have fallen to a [...] "safe" [...] level before emerging. When using the extension cord, a slight delay in measurement readings occurs, however this is not really an issue, as outdoor radiation levels are unlikely to change quickly.|$|R

They were illustrated with the use of numerous examples of progressing degradation of the surface condition of parts and components of various types of aircraft engines which was found during endoscopic controls...|$|R
