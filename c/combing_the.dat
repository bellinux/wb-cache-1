5|$|After {{releasing}} the British steamer, Emden turned south to Simalur, {{where she met}} the captured collier Buresk. Müller then decided to attack the British coaling station in the Cocos Islands; he intended to destroy the wireless station there and draw away British forces searching {{for him in the}} Indian Ocean. While en route to the Cocos, Emden spent two days <b>combing</b> <b>the</b> Sunda Strait for merchant shipping without success. She thereafter proceeded to the Cocos, arriving off Direction Island at 06:00 on the morning of 9 November. Since there were no British vessels in the area, Müller sent ashore a landing party led by Kapitänleutnant (First Lieutenant) Hellmuth von Mücke, Emdens executive officer. The party consisted of another two officers, six non-commissioned officers, and thirty-eight sailors.|$|E

Convinced that Villeneuve was headed for the West Indies Nelson set off in pursuit.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> Holden <b>comb</b> was {{suited for}} <b>the</b> <b>combing</b> of short staple wools. The slivers of wool are {{fed into the}} machine through the feed guides to the filing head rollers and {{transferred}} to the pins of <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle by <b>the</b> lashing action of the filling heads. As <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle rotates, <b>the</b> fallers of the square motion rise, their pins piercing the fringe of fibres held in <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle by <b>the</b> keeper plate, and by drawing away give the fibres their initial combing. This removes any short fibres or noil and some long fibres termed robbings which are deposited in a box {{at the back of}} the square motion. As <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle carries <b>the</b> remaining fibres to the drawing-off head the fringe is penetrated by the pins of the intersecting or nacteur <b>combs,</b> <b>the</b> drawing-off rollers giving the fibres their final <b>combing</b> by removing <b>the</b> long fibres from the pins of <b>the</b> nacteur <b>comb</b> and <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle; <b>the</b> short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the coiler mechanism and into a can directly underneath.

25|$|The remote hilly Lan Xang proved most troublesome. He {{personally}} led the two-pronged {{invasion of}} Lan Xang in October 1569. Setthathirath made a stand at Vientiane {{for a few}} months before retreating into the jungle in February 1570 to conduct his tried-and-true guerrilla warfare. Bayinnaung and his men spent the next two months <b>combing</b> <b>the</b> Lao countryside. Setthathirath {{was nowhere to be found}} but many Burmese troops died of starvation and from long marches. He finally called off the search in April 1570, and returned home. When the king arrived back at Pegu, very few men of the original army survived to reach their own country.|$|E
25|$|Although Maeng Da had ended, {{military}} {{activity in the}} vicinity did not. South of Maeng Da, Orange and Green Battalions moved southward into Military Region 4. This move {{was supported by a}} melange of forward air controllers of the 23d Tactical Air Support Squadron and the Ravens, as well as Laotian forward air guides. On 3 September 1970, they occupied Ban Houei Mun, which was stocked as a forward airstrip for the Raven FACs. Beginning 9 September, the two battalions pushed 28 kilometers southeastward into low ground west of Tuomlane. Black Battalion joined them there. Meanwhile, White Battalion, joined by Mobile 2, spent 4–7 September 1970 <b>combing</b> <b>the</b> nearby Route 23 valley.|$|E
25|$|The {{meanings}} of part-of-speech affixes {{depend on the}} inherent part of speech of the root they are applied to. For example, brosi (to brush) {{is based on a}} nominal root (and therefore listed in modern dictionaries under the entry broso), whereas kombi (to comb) is based on a verbal root (and therefore listed under kombi). Change the suffix to -o, and the similar {{meanings of}} brosi and kombi diverge: broso is a brush, the name of an instrument, whereas kombo is a <b>combing,</b> <b>the</b> name of an action. That is, changing verbal kombi (to comb) to a noun simply creates the name for the action; for the name of the tool, the suffix -ilo is used, which derives words for instruments from verbal roots: kombilo (a comb). On the other hand, changing the nominal root broso (a brush) to a verb gives the action associated with that noun, brosi (to brush). For the name of the action, the suffix -ado will change a derived verb back to a noun: brosado (a brushing). Similarly, an abstraction of a nominal root (changing it to an adjective and then back to a noun) requires the suffix -eco, as in infaneco (childhood), but an abstraction of an adjectival or verbal root merely requires the nominal -o: belo (beauty). Nevertheless, redundantly affixed forms such as beleco are acceptable and widely used.|$|E

25|$|This {{was used}} when {{the best results}} were wanted from long fibred wools and hairs such as mohair, alpaca, long English and {{crossbred}} wools. In the Lister comb, the slivers of wool or hair are fed into the machine over the back plate, through the fluted feed rollers, under the spreader roller and onto the pins of the fallers which disentangle and transport the fibres to the nip jaw. The nip jaw, with its swinging motion, closes in upon the fringe of fibres, grasping them and pulling them out from the faller pins; thus partially <b>combing</b> <b>the</b> fibres which are then received by the carrier comb and conveyed to the pins of the large combing circle into which they are pressed by the dabbing brush. As the large circle rotates, the unique feature of the machine, the side circle comb gives the fibres a secondary combing, removing not the short fibres, but any excessively long ones. The large comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off rollers which give the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the circle pins, with the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the crimping box and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils are removed from the pins of the large comb circle by lifting knives, and deposited into a can ready for removal.|$|E

60|$|The Spanish fowl {{offers a}} more curious case; the male has an immense comb, {{but some of}} the {{successive}} variations, by the accumulation of which it was acquired, appear to have been transferred to the female; for she has a comb many times larger than that of the females of the parent species. But <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> of <b>the</b> female differs in one respect from that of the male, for it is apt to lop over; and within a recent period it has been ordered by the fancy that this should always be the case, and success has quickly followed the order. Now the lopping of <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> must be sexually limited in its transmission, otherwise it would prevent <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> of <b>the</b> male from being perfectly upright, which would be abhorrent to every fancier.

50|$|There are two {{competing}} <b>combing</b> technologies: <b>the</b> Noble (1853) <b>comb</b> (variants Lister, Heilman (1846) and Holden) and <b>the</b> French <b>comb.</b> <b>The</b> Noble <b>comb</b> technology is inefficient, hence most <b>combing</b> in <b>the</b> world {{is carried out}} on the French system. The French system is superior as it <b>combs</b> <b>the</b> entire length of a fiber. Noble <b>combs</b> suffer from <b>the</b> problem {{that they will not}} comb 2 mm of a fiber's length. The 2 mm is the distance between counter-rotating pins. The French system is a rectilinear combing system as opposed to earlier woollen systems developed in England. Although the Heilman and Noble comb was an original circular design (also developed in min and 18-19th-century England) as it happens in modern history, English mills didn't share technology - resulting in development of superior technology on continental Europe in the mid-19th century, as in France.|$|R
