40|$|Recently much {{attention}} has been given to the idea of reducing the debt of developing countries through a "menu approach" of schemes that attempt to harness the discounts on debt in the secondary market. This paper, after reviewing the rationale for the orthodox strategy of <b>concerted</b> <b>lending</b> and the case for debt forgiveness, examines the logic behind several market-based debt reduction schemes. It shows that such schemes will ordinarily benefit both debtor and creditor only when the debtor is {{on the wrong side of}} the "debt relief Laffer curve" [...] that is, where a reduction in nominal claims actually increases expected payment. This is, however, also the case in which unilateral debt forgiveness is in the interest of creditors in any case. The implication is that there is no magic in market-based debt reduction, as opposed to more straightforward approaches. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dual economy {{model of the}} fix-price/flex-price kind that explicitly allows {{for the existence of}} a government budget constraint in a fully open economy. Both the external and fiscal clo-sures resemble very much the contemporary experience of several Latin American countries, where fiscal discipline and fix exchange rate systems have been the norm. Thus, within the public sector, it is assumed that public investment is the adjustment variable, while foreign reserves variation adjusts the external balance. Short-run impacts of policy-induced variables and changes in exogenous external financing are analysed. Relevant trade-offs, especially between output and inflation, follow from an analysis in which the time perspective is rather short. However, in the medium term, some balancing forces in the economy can moderate the trade-offs. We show among a wide range of events and policy options that this is the case of debt relief or a <b>concerted</b> <b>lending</b> strategy. 1...|$|R
40|$|By 1985, {{the debt}} crisis was as major a problem {{as it had been}} in 1982, but it had changed greatly in character. Among all three of the {{principal}} players in the drama—the indebted countries, their commercial creditors, and the official creditors and multilateral institutions—there was an increasing realization that not even a full resolution of the initial financial crisis and successful implementation of traditional adjustment programs would produce a resumption of growth in the most heavily indebted countries. Furthermore, in some important respects, the initial financial crisis was already over and had been overtaken by longer-run problems. The commercial banks at mid-decade were putting the systemic financial crisis behind them in several ways. First, the combination of <b>concerted</b> <b>lending</b> packages and adjustment programs had bought enough time for many banks (especially those outside the United States, in countries with relatively favorable tax and regulatory treatment) to set aside adequate liquid reserves as a provision against potential losses. By 1986, banks in continental European countries had provisions averagin...|$|R

40|$|Using data on all <b>lending</b> <b>deals</b> in the Brazilian {{stock market}} from 2009 to 2011, we provide {{answers to the}} {{following}} questions: i) are short-sellers informed in Brazil?, ii) which short sellers are informed?, and iii) how are short sellers informed? The answer {{to the first question}} is positive, the Brazilian short-seller is informed. Among short-sellers, individual investors are as informed as investment funds. To provide an answer to the third question, our approach is to observe how short-selling behaves around days when relevant corporate news are disclosed. We show that funds are more informed just after the disclosure of news, an indication that these investors short-sell after processing news. On the other hand, individual investors increase short-selling prior to bad news and decrease short-selling prior to good news. Finally, we present arguments why this last result is a strong evidence of inside information trading in the Brazilian short selling market...|$|R

25|$|The {{meristem}} can {{be defined}} as the tissue or group of plant tissues that contain undifferentiated stem cells, which are capable of producing any type of cell tissue. Their maintenance and development, both in the vegetative meristem or the meristem of the inflorescence is controlled by genetic cell fate determination mechanisms. This means that a number of genes will directly regulate, for example, the maintenance of the stem cell’s characteristics (gene WUSCHEL or WUS), and others will act via negative feedback mechanisms in order to inhibit a characteristic (gene CLAVATA or CLV).

40|$|We {{model the}} impact credit {{constraints}} and market risk {{have on the}} vertical relationships between firms in the supply chain. We study the effects on short-run retail prices; long-run investment levels; and incentives to outsource. The analysis begins by showing that credit constrained risk neutral firms become endogenously risk averse. They therefore wish to push some risk onto suppliers. The optimal risk-sharing contract proposed by the credit constrained party involves a slotting fee (prevalent in groceries) or risk sharing. This generates double marginalization: credit constraints push up short run retail prices. We demonstrate that this effect may be exacerbated {{by an increase in}} the anticipated interest rate the firm can borrow at (“tight money”). This provides a new explanation for the price puzzle in macroeconomics. Further, the possibility of supplier-insurance implies that out-sourcing to a credit-unconstrained supplier dominates in-house provision. We show that there is an intrinsic complementarity between supplier insurance and lending so that a supplier might be {{in a better position to}} provide a loan than the bank-ing sector. This is consistent with the practice of finance arms of major suppliers linking <b>lending</b> to supply <b>deals.</b> We consider the impact on consumers of supply contract changes arising from: a deterioration of corporate governance; shocks to demand; shocks to market risk; changes in investment opportunities; and mergers and acquisitions.

One of the most aggressive challengers is Länsförsäkringar Bank, which in 2009 had seven per cent of the Swedish bank market for farmers, but 57 per cent of all new <b>lending.</b> This paper <b>deals</b> {{with the problem of}} new banks to break into the bank market where farmers are slow in terms of change in their attitudes and loyal to their banks. The study has been carried out in cooperation with Länsförsäkringar Gävleborg which is a new actor in the banking market and thus eager {{to take part in the}} outcome of the study. This essay thus seeks to examine the attitudes farmers have against bank switching and the factors that influence their choice of bank. The theories used in the study are primarily behavioral theory but also transaction cost theory and decision models have been used. Based on these theories, a number of hypotheses have been formulated. From these hypotheses questions were derived and these were used in the interviews with the farmers. The empirical data has been gathered through telephone interviews with 16 farmers in the county of Gävleborg. They constitute four groups according to their current banking situation. Group 1 consists of farmers who are loyal customers of Länsförsäkringar. Farmers in group 2 have recently switched to Länsförsäkringar while farmers in group 3 recently changed from Länsförsäkringar or have their mortgages with another bank. Group 4 consists of farmers who are customers of one of Länsförsäkringar´s competitors. The findings show that there are some differences between the groups. Farmers in group 1 and group 2 value the skills they obtain from Länsförsäkringar very high. The skills of the staff were the key factor to the farmers in group 2 when they switched to Länsförsäkringar. Group 3 value the economic aspects most of all farmers in the study but they also value the skills. This is evidenced by the fact that they recourse several banks depending on the service needs of the personal relationship with the bank. For example, they consider that the mortgages does not require a deeper relationship with the bank and thus select which bank they use for this service based entirely on economic grounds. Farmers in group 4 do not value that the bank staff have expertise in agriculture; they see the bank only as a creditor. Overall, the farmers report that repeated misconduct of their present bank is necessary before a change is considered. It is also very difficult to get a farmer to change his attitude toward a specific bank. The attitude towards bank switching, by contrast, changed in a number of cases after the farmers changed bank and discovered that it was not as complicated as they had expected...|$|R
