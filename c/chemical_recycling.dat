40|$|Plant {{leaf litter}} is an {{important}} source of soil chemicals that are essential for the ecosystem and changes in leaf litter chemical traits during decomposition will determine the availability of multiple <b>chemical</b> elements <b>recycling</b> in the ecosystem.

30|$|The third recycling, {{also called}} <b>chemical</b> <b>recycling,</b> has great {{potential}} {{because of the}} severe limitations of the mechanical recycling of PET wastes. <b>Chemical</b> <b>recycling</b> enables recovery of the petrochemical constituents of PET wastes, which can be utilized for remanufacturing PET products or other synthetic chemicals.
