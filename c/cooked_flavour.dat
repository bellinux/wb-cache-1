40|$|International audienceCooked or sulfurous {{off-flavour}} {{caused by}} volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) limits acceptance of ultra-high temperature (UHT) milk {{in some parts}} of the world. Therefore, the concentrations of VSCs in UHT milk over 16  weeks of storage were studied and compared with those in pasteurised milk. The major VSCs contributing to the <b>cooked</b> <b>flavour</b> were identified using solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography with pulsed flame photometric detection. Nine VSCs were detected in commercial indirectly processed UHT skim and whole milk. These were hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide, carbon disulfide, dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl sulfone and dimethyl trisulfide. An additional VSC was detected but not identified. The concentrations of hydrogen sulfide, methanthiol, dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl trisulfide were initially higher than their reported threshold values indicating their importance in milk flavour, especially <b>cooked</b> <b>flavour.</b> However, they decreased slowly during storage to levels below their threshold values. This decrease corresponded to a decrease in dissolved oxygen level. Four VSCs, carbon disulfide, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethyl disulfide, were detected in pasteurised milk; however, their concentrations were lower than their reported threshold values. This paper puts into perspective the significance of VSCs in the flavour of UHT and pasteurised milk, both initially and during storage, and indicates the period of storage for minimisation of <b>cooked</b> <b>flavour</b> in UHT milk...|$|E
40|$|Heating milk to high {{temperatures}} such as 140 ºC, {{as used in}} ultra high temperature (UHT) processing, causes physical and chemical changes in the milk. The production of a <b>cooked</b> <b>flavour</b> is a major change which reduces consumer acceptance of the UHT milk. It has been correlated {{with the formation of}} volatile sulphur compounds (VSCs) that result from milk proteins, principally the whey proteins β-lactoglobulin, containing the the sulphur amino acids cystine, cysteine and methionine. The VSCs in milk, whose concentrations are in the parts per billion to parts per million range, are highly reactive, easily oxidised, and sensitive to heat during thermal processing and analysis; this makes them a challenge to analyse. A sensitive method based on gas chromatography with pulsed flame photometric detection coupled with headspace sampling by solid phase microextraction (SPME/GC/PFPD) was developed to detect these compounds in commercial UHT milk and to investigate their production and disappearance during heating and storage. The SPME/GC/PFPD procedure was optimised using different extraction time (15 min, 30 min, & 60 min) – temperature (30 oC, 45 oC & 60 oC) combinations with CAR/PDMS fibre to obtain maximum sensitivity. A short extraction time (15 min) at low temperature (30 oC) was chosen to provide high sensitivity for detecting all VSCs in UHT milk without introducing artefactual VSCs. The extraction method and GC run time (16 min) make this method simple and fast. Nine VSCs were detected in commercial indirectly processed UHT milk, skim and whole. These are hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S), carbonyl sulphide (COS), methanethiol (MeSH), dimethyl sulphide (DMS), carbon disulphide (CS 2), dimethyl disulphide (DMDS), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), dimethyl sulphone (Me 2 SO 2) and dimethyl trisulphide (DMTS). An additional unknown compound was detected but could not be identified by GC/MS because its concentration was below the detection limit of the MS detector. The concentrations of H 2 S, DMS and DMTS were higher than their threshold values indicating their importance in milk flavour, especially <b>cooked</b> <b>flavour.</b> Several {{attempts have been made to}} reduce the <b>cooked</b> <b>flavour</b> in UHT milk. In the current research, the use of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) to oxidise the VSCs and thereby reduce <b>cooked</b> <b>flavour</b> was investigated. H 2 O 2 is used as a milk preservative and is generally recognised as safe (GRAS) in USA. Several concentrations of H 2 O 2 (0. 001 %, 0. 005 %, 0. 01 %, 0. 02 % & 0. 03 %) were added to milk to assess its effects on VSCs and on whey proteins denaturation in UHT milk. H 2 O 2 effectively reduced the concentration of all VSCs, except DMDS which was increased, presumably by oxidation of MeSH. H 2 S was completely oxidised or reduced below its threshold value. Low concentrations of H 2 O 2 (0. 001 % & 0. 005 %) had no effect on, or decreased, the extent of denaturation of β-lactoglobulin when added after or before processing, respectively. Some UHT plants use severe heating conditions, leading to high levels of denaturation of whey proteins, particularly β-Lg, the main source of the VSCs in milk. Correlations between heat severity, β-Lg denaturation and individual VSC generation were investigated in milk batch-heated at 80 oC and 90 oC, and UHT milk processed at 120 - 150 oC. In accordance with previous reports, β-Lg was more heat-sensitive than α-La. Only five VSCs were detected. The concentrations of H 2 S and MeSH correlated well with denaturation of β-Lg and α-La. DMS concentration correlated well with β-Lg in UHT milk but not in the batch-heated milk. CS 2 did not show a good correlation with heat intensity and appeared to plateau out after a certain level of heating. Conversely, COS and MeSH seemed to require a certain minimum amount of heat before generation commenced; this corresponded to denaturation of β-Lg above 49 % and 89 % respectively at 80 oC. The higher concentrations of DMS and H 2 S in UHT milk compared with batch-heated samples having similar degrees of denaturation suggested other possible sources for their production and the importance of the heat severity in generating them. For example, at high heat intensity, S-methylmethionine and thiamine could be sources of DMS and H 2 S respectively. Furthermore, in whole milk as used in this work, milk fat globule membrane proteins are another source of VSCs. The outcome of this study will help UHT manufacturers to understand the production and disappearance of the VSCs in commercial UHT milk and how to adjust the processing conditions to avoid generation of <b>cooked</b> <b>flavour.</b> Additionally, the promising results of using low concentrations of H 2 O 2 to oxidise the VSCs will provide the industry with another means of reducing <b>cooked</b> <b>flavour.</b> Before H 2 O 2 use is implemented in UHT processing, future studies are required to evaluate all of its effects, including sporicidal effects. Overall, this study makes a contribution to finding a solution to the <b>cooked</b> <b>flavour</b> problem in UHT milk, thereby increasing market share of this milk in countries such as Australia, the UK and North America where <b>cooked</b> <b>flavour</b> is the main barrier to its consumer acceptance...|$|E

40|$|The home {{environment}} potentially presents a simple means to increase acceptance of sensory properties of vegetables by preparation. This research investigated how preparation can effectively impact upon children's acceptance for vegetables. Five- and six-year old children (n = 82, balanced for vegetable consumption) tasted and evaluated two Brassica vegetables, broccoli and cauliflower, each prepared in six different ways via variations in cooking method (boiling versus steaming) and cooking time (3 levels, ranging from 2 to 14 min). Children rated samples for liking and a trained descriptive panel assessed the samples' sensory properties. Across vegetable types, medium cooking times were liked more than {{short and long}} cooking times (p < 0. 0001), and these samples were medium firm and cohesive, with a balance of green and <b>cooked</b> <b>flavour</b> notes. Boiled samples were less intense in flavour and taste than steamed samples, but overall {{did not differ in}} acceptance. Significant interactions were found. Cooking method played a role in acceptance of broccoli but not cauliflower, with medium steamed broccoli liked the most. There was no difference in acceptance between low and high vegetable consumers, although high vegetable consumers were more discriminating in acceptance for cauliflower. In conclusion, children's acceptance of Brassica vegetables may be altered by preparation. There may be advantage in promoting steaming of Brassica vegetables to children, as they do not object to the flavour, and steaming is nutritionally preferable to boiling. Very short cooking times lead to an undesirable sensory profile and should be avoided. Recommendations are applicable to children regardless of their vegetable intake. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Blueberries {{contain a}} high {{concentration}} {{and diversity of}} anthocyanins which {{are responsible for the}} blue/purple pigment of their skin. Like many other fruits and vegetables they also contain a large amount of chlorogenic acid (CGA) within the fruit flesh and seeds. Together these phytochemicals appear to account for most of the high antioxidant activity of the fruit, although within the scientific community a consensus has not been reached as to their effects on human health. Fresh blueberries have a limited season and are perishable unless stored frozen. Processing of blueberries into juice allows year round sale, and importantly less market-driven pricing. Therefore the aim of this research project was to investigate and optimise factors which may be significant in producing a high phytochemical blueberry juice. The pigment of blueberries is concentrated in the skin, and therefore smaller blueberries have the highest anthocyanin concentrations on a weight basis. Consequently the three highest concentrations were found in cultivars ‘Elliot’, ‘Burlington’ and ‘Duke’. Conversely chlorogenic acid is not restricted to the blueberry skin; ‘Elliot’, ‘Bluecrop’ and ‘Burlington’ had the three highest concentrations, while ‘Duke’ had the lowest. The profile of individual anthocyanins was also found to be diverse amongst cultivars. Therefore if individual anthocyanin(s) are shown to be important for specific health conditions further consideration should be given to cultivar selection. Upon review of the current blueberry juice manufacturing process, large anthocyanin losses were seen at three key steps: after thawing of the fruit, removal of the press cake and holding of the juice between pressing and pasteurisation. Two alternative processes were compared where a slightly higher anthocyanin concentration was achieved for ‘hot press juice’ but a lower chlorogenic acid concentration than the alternative ‘cold press’ juice. Modifications to the manufacturing process were investigated using the pilot plant at Massey University. It was found that blanching of frozen blueberries before pressing was successful in significantly increasing the anthocyanin and chlorogenic acid concentration of the juice (about a 5 fold increase of anthocyanins and a 4 fold increase in chlorogenic acid from previous levels). However, this did alter the sensory properties of the juice significantly, with a more <b>cooked</b> <b>flavour</b> and thicker texture. Other variations that were trialled, such as milling, ii variation in holding time and temperature between pressing and pasteurising, had comparatively little effect on the anthocyanin and chlorogenic acid concentration. Storage tests on blueberry juice showed a clear relationship between the storage temperature and anthocyanin retention, where warmer temperatures resulted in larger anthocyanin degradation. At the end of the six month storage period, juice storage at 5 °C gave 63 % anthocyanin retention while juice storage at 25 °C gave only 8 % retention. Some protection was also afforded to juice packed in glass bottles rather than plastic and stored in the dark rather than the light; but this difference was far smaller than the effect of temperature. Chlorogenic acid levels appeared to be comparatively less affected; only relatively small amounts of degradation were observed. It {{is important to note that}} when the antioxidant capacity was measured for stored juice at six months under the various treatments, there was only a small degree of degradation for all samples as compared with at time zero. Previously researchers had encountered a similar phenomenon and suggested that unknown anthocyanin degradation products may still be able to contribute to the juice’s antioxidant capacity. However, here it is also suggested that chlorogenic acid may have had a more significant contribution to the antioxidant capacity that it is usually credited with, due to the large amount present with relatively little degradation throughout the storage period. This information may be used to produce and market a juice with high anthocyanin, chlorogenic acid and/or antioxidant properties. Of the health effects evaluated here, currently, research in cardiovascular disease and neuroprotection effects are looking the most promising with regard to dietary blueberry supplementation in humans, although there is still a lack of double blind randomised placebo controlled studies to come to any consensus within the scientific community. Additionally, at the present time, the use of health claims on food products in New Zealand is being revised (Food Standards Authority proposal P 293). As the current state of nutrition research surrounding plant polyphenols is inconclusive it may be important to use generic statements such as ‘high in antioxidants’ rather than statements about specific compounds...|$|E

The muscles were treated at electric field strength of 0. 8 - 1. 1 kV/cm, pulse width of 20 μs, frequency of 50 Hz and energy of 130 kJ/kg. Temporal dominance of sensations (TDS) analysis were carried out to determine the temporal changes in sensory attributes of PEF treated beef samples.

40|$|The dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is an {{important}} grain legume that is used for human consumption worldwide. In Africa {{and other parts of}} the World, legume diets contribute tremendously to protein and energy requirements of consumers. Dry beans provide about 16 - 33 % protein, dietary fibre (between 14 and 19 %), starch, minerals and vitamins. Dry beans have a long storage life and can be cooked as whole grains, fried or dehulled and splitted for production of dhal and salads. There is a tremendous variability in the dry bean varieties. It is believed that consumer preferences for dry beans are influenced by factors such as seed size, seed colour, cooking time and flavour. Although, substantial research has been done on physicochemical properties, description of sensory properties that differentiate bean varieties specifically in terms of liked or disliked flavours was lacking. Sensory evaluation is one of the methods used for evaluating product quality and it can be used to describe the sensory properties of a product (i. e. descriptive sensory evaluation) and determines its acceptability by consumers (i. e. consumer acceptability or preferences).

Mkuzi beans were mostly described as having a soapy mouthfeel. Jenny (MP), Kranskop (MP&FS) were sweet, soft and with a <b>cooked</b> bean <b>flavour.</b> Consumer sensory evaluation revealed that beans with sweet, soft and <b>cooked</b> bean <b>flavours</b> were the most preferred. Beans that took long to cook and those that were described as bitter, soapy and metallic in the mouth, received low consumer ratings on a 9 -point hedonic scale. The total polyphenol content of PAN 150 (MP), along with Jenny and AC Calmont from MP was determined to find out whether the bitterness was associated with its polyphenol concentration. PAN 150 beans had the lowest concentration of total polyphenols compared to the two other varieties, suggesting that factors other than total polyphenol content caused the bitterness of these beans. A follow up investigation of mineral profiles in whole bean flour of all six bean varieties from the two locations was done to find out whether differences in mineral content e. g. iron (Fe) contributed to bitterness and metallic mouthfeel of certain beans. Results showed significant (p< 0. 05) variety differences for phosphorous (P) and significant (p< 0. 05) location differences for magnesium (Mn) only. Fe and copper (Cu) contents did not contribute to bitterness or metallic mouthfeel of PAN 150 beans. For maximum consumer acceptability, farmers should concentrate on the production of beans that have characteristics similar to Kranskop (MP&FS), PAN 148 (FS) and Jenny (MP) beans. As bean hardening was suspected in Jenny (FS), PAN 148 (MP) and Mkuzi (MP), the importance of storing beans at proper temperatures (e. g. less than 35 ºC) and relative humidity (e. g. < 75 %) should be emphasized to minimize the development of the hard-to-cook defect over long storage periods.

40|$|Background and Aims: Interactions are {{the main}} causes of {{complexity}} in field experiments; however, no studies have combined water and temperature regimes in field-growing vines. Here we assessed grape and wine attributes from a field trial where these factors were directly manipulated. Methods and Results: The experiment consisted of Shiraz vines grown in a 22 factorial experiment with two temperature (control and heated) and two water regimes (deficit and irrigated) during two seasons (2010 / 11 and 2011 / 12). The sensory and compositional characteristics of grapes and wines were assessed in both seasons, whereas a detailed profile of the phenolic substances was determined by spectrophotometry in 2011 / 12. We found additive effects (i. e. lack of interaction) between temperature and water for berry mass and components, fruit composition (titratable acidity and pH), grape phenolic substances (12. 5 % ethanol-extracted {{and most of the}} 70 % acetone-extracted), wine phenolic substances (chemical age 2), and wine sensory traits (floral aromas and berry flavours). Significantly, previously unrecorded interactions between temperature and water were found for grape phenolic substances (70 % acetone-extracted skin and seed tannins and total phenolic substances per berry), wine phenolic substances (colour density, tannins and phenolic substances) and wine sensory traits (floral aromas, <b>cooked</b> fruit <b>flavours</b> and tannin structure). Conclusion: The effect of water deficit leading to colourful and flavoursome wines rich in phenolic substances may not be held under high temperature. Significance of the Study: Our study anticipates the drier and hotter climate of the Barossa Valley, and provides industry with indications of a shift in wine profiles that would require technological innovation to maintain the identity of Barossa Shiraz.

50|$|Imperial cuisine in the Ming dynasty {{was mostly}} <b>cooked</b> with the <b>flavours</b> of {{southern}} China {{because of the}} preferences of Zhu Yuanzhang, {{the founder of the}} Ming dynasty. The cuisine in the Ming palace totally changed the Mongolian style of food served during the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty. The imperial cuisine of the Ming dynasty had one important characteristic, which was to protect health. The emperors of the Ming dynasty paid great attention to protecting health by eating healthy food. The menu of imperial cuisine changed daily and dishes were not repeated. Imperial cuisine of the Ming dynasty was mainly grain-based. Therefore, meat and bean products were not as popular {{as they were in the}} former dynasties. In the Qing dynasty, a famous dish was sweet potatoes. Maize and chili peppers were also introduced in around the mid-16th century. Other famous dishes included shark's fin soup and edible bird's nest also gained their fame during this period. Those two dishes were introduced to China by the explorer Zheng He in the early Ming dynasty. While these two dishes were becoming examples of extravagant dishes, sea cucumbers and prawns were also brought into China. Many famous cooks and chefs such as Song Wusao and Wang Eryu emerged in the Ming dynasty.|$|R
40|$|Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp) is an {{important}} legume mainly used for human consumption worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Cowpea legume is rich in protein (25 %), carbohydrates (70 %), dietary fibre, minerals and vitamins. Cowpea comprises a range of varieties that breeders release based primarily on agronomic characteristics, such as yield, early maturity and drought tolerance. However, consumers do not always adopt all the released cowpea varieties. Cooking characteristics such as cooking time and sensory properties (i. e. appearance, texture, <b>flavour)</b> of <b>cooked</b> cowpeas {{are believed to be}} quality characteristics for legume acceptability by consumers. Physicochemical characteristics are known to influence cooking characteristics of cowpeas. These characteristics may be influenced by seed coat and cotyledon structure. The present study focuses on the effect of seed coat and cotyledon structure on cooking and sensory characteristics of cowpeas and how this in turn influences consumer acceptability of cowpeas. The influence of seed coat thickness and cotyledon compactness on cooking characteristics of four cowpea types (thick seed coat/compact cotyledon (Bechuana White), thick seed coat/porous cotyledon (IT 82 E 18), thin seed coat/compact cotyledon (Black Eye) and thin seed coat/porous cotyledon (California Black) was studied. Seed coat thickness was found to influence water absorption during soaking. Cowpeas with thin seed coats had higher rates of water absorption during soaking due to its amorphous cell layer that rendered the seed coat more permeable compared to the palisade cell layer found in cowpeas with thick seed coats. Cotyledon compactness influenced cooking time of cowpeas. Cowpeas with porous cotyledons cooked faster compared to cowpeas with compact cotyledon probably because of the structural arrangement of porous cotyledon cells that provide more intercellular spaces for rapid water entry, cell expansion and separation favouring a faster cooking process compared to compact cotyledon. Seed coat and cotyledon structures directly influenced very few of the cooking and sensory characteristics. Sensory attributes such as <b>cooked</b> cowpea <b>flavour,</b> degree of sweetness, degree of sweet aftertaste, and degree of mushiness positively contributed to consumers’ liking of cowpeas. Raw cowpea flavour, bitter taste, degree of bitter aftertaste and degree of firmness contributed to consumers’ disliking of cowpeas. Chemical composition of cowpeas probably influences sensory characteristics of cowpeas more than seed coat and cotyledon structures. It is recommended that breeders work together with food scientists in order to release cowpeas types that are preferred by consumers (i. e. cowpeas with good appearance (low percentage of splitting), good flavour and soft texture upon cooking.
