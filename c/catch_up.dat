5|$|At {{the age of}} 13, Brooks {{suffered}} a loss of confidence. After being champion in all four strokes for the previous four years, he was now frequently losing.

Within a year, Brooks' physical growth began to <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> and he started to regain the dominant position. He also switched from distance to sprint events.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{arrived in}} Princeton, New Jersey, in late December 1805.

When the next term began in May, he joined the American Whig–Cliosophic Society, a debating society founded by James Madison, Philip Freneau, Aaron Burr, and Henry Lee in 1769.|$|E

5|$|The Wrights issued {{their own}} factual {{statement}} to the press in January. Nevertheless, the flights did not create public excitement—if people even knew about them—and the news soon faded.

Meanwhile, Clark left Major Charles Cracraft with provisions and a small group of men on Camp Three Island to await Lochry's arrival. Further down the Ohio, Clark stopped at the mouth of the Kanawha River, but again he decided to keep moving in order to prevent desertion. Clark left a letter fastened to a pole which instructed Lochry to keep following.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Grant {{suggested}} {{to his colleagues}} that they should <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> with the presidential limousine. Since {{he was the only}} Dallas-based member of the press in camera car two, Grant directed his driver to the Trade Mart, where they saw no activity. A worker across the street said he saw a limousine speed past, accompanied by motorcycles with their sirens blaring; Grant knew immediately that they were headed to Parkland Memorial Hospital. Once at Parkland, Grant started snapping pictures of anything he could, including Vice President Johnson's car, and a man and a police officer delivering what Grant believed was blood plasma.|$|E
5|$|As {{promotion}} for the show, Showtime {{posted a}} preview of the pilot on their website. In September 2006, CBS and YouTube struck a strategic content and advertising partnership, and the YouTube CBS Brand Channel started including daily contributions from the Showtime network, including promotional video clips from its critically acclaimed original series, such as Dexter. On October 28, after the first few episodes had aired, Showtime made it easier for viewers to <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> with the show by dedicating a whole night to showing the first five episodes.|$|E

5|$|As {{the match}} between Dusty Rhodes and Randy Savage {{was about to}} begin, Ted DiBiase {{appeared}} and {{announced that he had}} purchased Sapphire. Rhodes walked down the aisle toward DiBiase and Sapphire but was attacked from behind by Savage. Savage controlled most of the match, and Sherri interfered to help him while the referee was distracted. Rhodes made a brief comeback, but Savage was able to pin him after hitting him with Sherri's purse, which was said to be loaded with a heavy object. After the match, Rhodes chased after DiBiase and Sapphire but was unable to <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> to their departing limousine.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{says that}} when the Persians in Asia Minor heard {{of the attack on}} Sardis, they {{gathered}} together, and marched to the relief of Artaphernes. When they arrived at Sardis, they found the Greeks recently departed. So they followed their tracks back towards Ephesus. They caught up with the Greeks outside Ephesus and the Greeks were forced to turn and prepare to fight. Holland suggests that the Persians were primarily cavalry (hence their ability to <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> with the Greeks). The typical Persian cavalry of the time were probably missile cavalry, whose tactics were to wear down a static enemy with volley after volley.|$|E
5|$|In general relativity, no {{material}} body can <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> with or overtake a light pulse. No influence from an event A can reach any other location X before light sent out at A to X. In consequence, {{an exploration of}} all light worldlines (null geodesics) yields key information about the spacetime's causal structure. This structure can be displayed using Penrose–Carter diagrams in which infinitely large regions of space and infinite time intervals are shrunk ("compactified") so as to fit onto a finite map, while light still travels along diagonals as in standard spacetime diagrams.|$|E

Two amateur radio call signs, U1MIR and U2MIR, were assigned to Mir in the late 1980s, allowing amateur radio operators on Earth to communicate with the cosmonauts. The station was also equipped with a supply of books and films for the crew to read and watch.|$|E

The Mistress explains to the shocked crowd what the man had done, then takes a cured Lad home. They later learn that the crowd destroyed the man's expensive car and he was expelled from the club for killing Lady.|$|E
5|$|Lochry's {{force was}} part of an army being raised by George Rogers Clark for a {{campaign}} against Detroit, the British regional headquarters. Clark, the preeminent American military leader on the northwestern frontier, worked with Governor Thomas Jefferson of Virginia in planning an expedition to capture Detroit, by which they hoped {{to bring an end to}} British support of the Indian war effort. In early August 1781, Clark and about 400 men left Fort Pitt in Pennsylvania by boat, floating down the Ohio River a few days ahead of Lochry and his men, who were trying to <b>catch</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
