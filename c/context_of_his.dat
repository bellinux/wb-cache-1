5|$|Symeon {{wrote in}} a similar style and taught the {{traditional}} views of several early Christian fathers and hesychasts, including St. Augustine, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Mark the Hermit. Where Symeon differed from his predecessors was in his transparent and open sharing of his most interior experiences. Symeon was the first Byzantine mystic to freely share those experiences, which were given in the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> teaching that the direct experience of God was something to which all Christians could aspire.|$|E
5|$|A general {{perception}} on Narayan {{was that}} he did not involve himself or his writings with the politics or problems of India, as mentioned by V. S. Naipaul in one of his columns. However, according to Wyatt Mason of The New Yorker, although Narayan's writings seem simple and display a lack of interest in politics, he delivers his narrative with an artful and deceptive technique when dealing with such subjects and does not entirely avoid them, rather letting the words play in the reader's mind. Srinivasa Iyengar, former vice-chancellor of Andhra University, says that Narayan wrote about political topics only in the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> subjects, quite unlike his compatriot Mulk Raj Anand who dealt with the political structures and problems of the time. Paul Brians, in his book Modern South Asian Literature in English, says that the fact that Narayan completely ignored British rule and focused on the private lives of his characters is a political statement on its own, declaring his independence from the influence of colonialism.|$|E

50|$|As one of {{the most}} {{influential}} ancient Egyptian historians, al-Maqrizi’s Khitat dominates scholarly discourse on the architecture and structure of Medieval Egypt even today, six hundred years after he wrote it. Maqrizi not only describes the physical buildings of Cairo in great detail, he gives a picture of the entire construction; explaining materials, difficulties, changes in plans, and connecting these elements to greater economic, social, religious, and historical <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time.|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the use of a pastoral romance from the 1590s indicates that at the end <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career, Shakespeare felt a renewed interest in the dramatic <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> youth. Minor influences also suggest such an interest. As in Pericles, he uses a chorus to advance the action in the manner of the naive dramatic tradition; the use of a bear in the scene on the Bohemian seashore is almost certainly indebted to Mucedorus, a chivalric romance revived at court around 1610.|$|R
5|$|The Fiery Trial {{begins with}} Lincoln's {{encounters}} with slavery {{in his early}} life, growing up in Kentucky and Indiana. He occasionally dealt with issues of slavery in his law practice in Illinois. The book also discusses Lincoln's position on slavery in the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> political career. Lincoln was a moderate, attempting {{to bridge the gap}} between the abolitionist Radical Republicans and conservative Democrats, including those in the slave-holding states, whom he hoped would choose preserving the Union over steadfastly defending slavery. Lincoln initially supported the idea of voluntary colonization of freed blacks to Africa, a stance supported by some politicians at the time, although considered unethical by many. However, Lincoln eventually abandoned his moderate stance on slavery when he determined that to win the American Civil War, he needed to act to end slavery.|$|E
5|$|The {{relation}} {{of church and}} state in Zwingli's mind is best represented in a statue by the Wasserkirche, where he stands with a Bible {{in one hand and a}} sword in the other. For him, the church and state are one under the sovereign rule of God. The development of the complex relationship between church and state in Zwingli's view can only be understood by examining the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life, the city of Zürich, and the wider Swiss Confederation. His earliest writings before he became a reformer, such as The Ox (1510) and The Labyrinth (1516), reveal a patriotic love of his land, a longing for liberty, and opposition to the mercenary service where young Swiss citizens were sent to fight in foreign wars for the financial benefit of the state government. His life as a parish priest and an army chaplain helped to develop his concern for morality and justice. He saw his ministry not limited to a private sphere, but to the people as a whole.|$|E

Instability, however, is made to appear greater {{to the extent that}} some <b>of</b> the significant <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life and the patterns <b>of</b> <b>his</b> thought are neglected. The present essay explores one such patterning of thought: ideas of evolution and degeneration, or progress and decay, in his thinking with regard to a range of societies: Ancient Rome, the peoples of Africa and South America, Britain and Germany, and Ireland. The essay draws on recent work on degeneration in the history of ideas...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, I have {{analysed}} {{the first}} decade of Becker’s research and the central role that it played during the early period <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career. These were crucial years in positioning Becker as an influential and controversial economist. We have placed Becker’s early contributions to human capital research within the broader and overlapping <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> intellectual development and within a circle of interactions and collaborations that revolved largely around Chicago’s and Columbia’s Departments of Economics. This network was very important in stimulating Becker’s interest in researching human capital and in helping him to develop original and influential contributions within a collaborative framework.|$|R

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of this}} thesis deals {{with the image of}} the Devil in a cultural perspective and historical contexts within figurative art, literature, cinema, theater, Central European folklore and human history. Subsequently, it focuses on the Devil with regards to the <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> interpretative forms. The practical part describes my own experience of theatrical interpretation of the character of the Devil through his various translation into dramatic texts. This, with reference to: M. Bulgakov´s the Master and Margarita, F. M. Dostojevskij´s Brothers Karamazov, Petr Boháč´s Dante ? The Light in a Darkness, J. Kráľa´s Wicked Maidens and into specific W. Goethe´s Faust...|$|R

40|$|Hegel {{develops}} <b>his</b> theory <b>of</b> will {{simultaneously in}} two different <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work: on one side, in the Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences, the corresponding Berlin lessons and in texts which {{can be considered as}} incipient versions of the Encyclopedia; on the other hand, in the Elements of the Philosophy of Right, the lessons based on them and in previous texts on the Philosophy of Right in which Hegel exposes <b>his</b> theory <b>of</b> subjective will. Now, the systematic structure and consequent periodization of the volitive process differ in both cases. This article aims to reconstruct Hegel’s System of the will by integrating organically the developments of both groups of texts...|$|R

25|$|Never {{stopping}} his work, in 1940, {{he finished}} his memoirs. He also placed {{the finishing touches on}} his musical research on the life of Ludwig van Beethoven.

25|$|King's {{earliest}} lithographs of 1962 {{were simply}} brilliant, {{not only in}} <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own work, but within the broader context {{of the art of}} lithography. The use of lithographic crayons, the watery film of touche and the scraping back of surfaces to produce stark contrasts in the surface textures were all properties which were unique to lithography and which King exploited with unerring skill.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{historians have}} rehabilitated King Duarte of Portugal, {{previously}} maligned and neglected, as an astute ruler and philosopher. There {{is still a}} tendency, however, to view Duarte as a depressive or a hypochondriac, due to <b>his</b> own description <b>of</b> <b>his</b> melancholy in his advice book, the Loyal Counselor. This paper reassesses Duarte's writings, drawing on key approaches {{in the history of}} medicine, such as narrative medicine and the history of the patient. It is important to take Duarte's views on his condition seriously, placing them in the medical and theological <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time and avoiding modern retrospective diagnosis. Duarte's writings can be used to explore the impact of plague, doubt and death on the life of a well-educated and conscientious late-medieval ruler...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe article {{examines}} Hegel's philosophy of language whose linguo-philosophical views were being formed {{in a general}} <b>context</b> <b>of</b> becoming <b>of</b> <b>his</b> philosophy <b>of</b> absolute spirit. The specificity of Hegel's understanding of a deeply spiritual language nature, {{at the root of}} which lies the key issues of the philosopher about the consubstantiality of Language and Spirit, is revealed. Particular attention is paid to the explanation of the significance of Hegel's “lessons” in current philosophical discourse and the need of their adoption for the development of human sciences in general...|$|R
25|$|Abhinavagupta {{remained}} unmarried all his life, we do however {{know him}} to be an adept of Kaula and as such, used his energy (ojas, or internally sublimated semen) as a vital force, {{a constant source of}} shakti to power the spiritual nervous system he outlined in his works. This system involves ritual union between Purusha as (Shiva) and shakti, yet this union is essentially non-physical and universal, and thus for a master such as Abhinavagupta, he was always in communion with Shiva-Shakti. We can only speculate about whether he was physically chaste, and either answer to this question is not very meaningful in the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life and teachings. Abhinavagupta parallels Shiva as both ascetic and enjoyer.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{learning}} the Scottish language and being thoroughly christianised, Oswiu may have fought for his Gaelic hosts, perhaps receiving his arms—a significant event—from a King of Dál Riata, such as Eochaid Buide, son of that Áedán mac Gabráin whom {{his father had}} defeated at the Battle of Degsastan. The Irish annals name one Oisiric mac Albruit, rigdomna Saxan—ætheling Osric—among the dead, alongside Connad Cerr, King of Dál Riata, and others of the Cenél nGabráin, at the Battle of Fid Eóin. Whether Oswiu's marriage with the Uí Néill princess Fín of the Cenél nEógain, {{and the birth of}} Aldfrith, should be placed in the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> exile, or took place at a later date is uncertain.|$|E
25|$|Working as a lawyer, {{he became}} a {{magistrate}} in 1881, when he pleaded on behalf of socialists on trial for incidents {{that occurred during the}} 10-year celebrations of the Paris Commune. He also pursued a political career, becoming cabinet chief to Interior Minister Rosetti in 1880. His final break with Junimea came in 1881, when he objected to the publication of a passage in Mihai Eminescu's Scrisoarea a III-a that denigrated Rosetti; he quit when publication went ahead. As revenge, both Maiorescu and Negruzzi gave unfair depictions of Panu in their writings, characterizing him as an ungrateful endlessly adaptable chameleon. It was only in 1943 that Eugen Lovinescu supplied a more balanced view of the man, placing him within the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> period.|$|E
