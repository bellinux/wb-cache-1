40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the sizes of <b>California</b> <b>sardines</b> (Sardinops caerulea) caught in the {{different}} areas of the Monterey and San Pedro regions off the coast of California. The present report is a sequel to Fish Bulletin 43, "The sizes of <b>California</b> <b>sardines</b> caught by the different fishing gear and in the different localities of the Monterey and San Pedro regions," except that in the present report no further work dealing with the sizes of sardines caught by different fishing gear was found necessary. The data of five more seasons have been added, allowing more definite conclusions, particularly for the Monterey region, where the data for only two seasons were available for the previous work. Also, a new fishing area has been added to the Monterey region. This report is concerned only with the fishery as carried on in connection with the canning and reduction of sardines and does not include the fishery for the fresh fish and bait industry. The former phase is the more important and the one for which we have continuous sampling data. The results of this investigation are of importance to cannery and reduction plant operators and to us, in showing the sizes of fish that can be expected in the different areas during an average season. Also additional evidence is furnished that indicates a southward movement of sardines along the California coast during the winter months. The findings for the Monterey region tend to have more bearing on the sampling of sardines than do the findings for the San Pedro region. During the fall months there are significant size differences between sardines in the southern and northern areas of the Monterey region, whereas in the San Pedro region consistent size differences between sardines in the different areas are not present. Therefore, during a season when the fishery might be carried on for the most part in the northern areas of the Monterey region, we will have larger size-groups represented than during a season in which the fishery might be carried on for the most part in the southern areas...|$|E

The following questions should be answered: Do the sardines move in to or out of the specific fishing areas during any one fishing season and if such movements are evident do they show any relation {{to the size of the}} fish?

40|$|The ring net, or purse lampara, is a {{cross between}} the purse seine and the {{relatively}} light lampara. It first appeared at San Pedro, California, in 1918, and was pronounced a failure.

In spite of its good points, the new net was not generally used until after 1926, when economic warfare with the sardine purse seiners forced the lampara fishermen to adopt a more effective form of gear.

As the gross observations of the state of maturity of the gonads of the sardine have not proved satisfactory, this detailed study of the diameters of the eggs in the ovaries was made. The study has established the dates of the spawning season, the size at first maturity, and the amount of spawning in each locality.

40|$|While {{weight and}} length of fishes are closely correlated, a {{detailed}} study {{of the relationship of}} these two units of measure shows many significant departures from a general mathematical law governing this relationship. These variations from the basic law have been utilized by students of fishery problems in racial studies and in determining the condition of fishes. However, before any study can be made of the significance of such departures from the normal, a clear understanding of the law governing the relationship between weight and length must be assured. The material used for the weight-length studies of the San Pedro sardine was obtained by staff members of the California State Fisheries Laboratory from the commercial catch landed at San Pedro.

He commanded such respect in his paid consultancy that the sardine organizations followed his advice without question even when he refused to endorse their proposals for increased catches, and in his area coordinator role he succeeded in strictly controlling all fishing vessels and fish processing plants operating in California and off its coast, assigning fishing boats to plants and then shifting them around to ensure that all plants would remain in operation and no waste would occur – all despite a fiercely competitive environment in the California fishing industry. Throughout the period, he held that proper management of fisheries required an understanding of the causes of fluctuation in fish populations and in 1943 published a paper that emphasized the need to understand the causes of mortality of fish early in their life cycle to truly understand fishery fluctuations.|$|R
40|$|From April, 1929, to September, 1932, {{the early}} life {{history of the}} <b>California</b> <b>sardine</b> (Sardina caerulea) was {{subjected}} to an intensive investigation.

In other words, it is intended that this investigation will establish a basis for the estimation of the relative success or failure of each year class two or three years before it enters the commercial catch. Forecasts of this nature are to be based upon the relative abundance of sardine larvae which are to be captured by specially constructed plankton nets operated quantitatively at key stations throughout the maximum spawning area. Because of the magnitude of this problem, the first four years of the investigation were devoted to two major studies: (1) the determination of the maximum spawning area, and (2) the consistency of this location from year to year. Related secondary problems, such as the development of the eggs, and the food, drift and rate of growth of the larvae were carefully considered and studied whenever material was available...|$|R

Here, we find unique time series characteristics of the periods when the climate changed for sardines in the 1930 - 2004 period.

The consensus concern for the program was whether this collapse was due to increased fishing pressure or environmental change. The program was initially led by Oscar Elton Sette, who forged a collaboration between research institutions (Scripps Institution of Oceanography) and government agencies (California Fish and Game Commission- recently renamed the California Department of Fish and Wildlife- and the United States Fish Commission- now known as the NOAA Fisheries Service) with the goal of resource management and fisheries conservation of the Eastern Pacific.|$|R
2500|$|Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean fishery off the U.S. West Coast, a [...] "sardine crisis" [...] was looming. [...] From 1916 through 1939, {{the annual}} sardine catch {{had more than}} doubled every six years, and had reached an annual high of about 1,500,000,000 pounds (680,000,000 kg) in 1936. Although California state {{biologists}} had warned against overfishing, the California state government {{had been unable to}} regulate sardine fishing through legislation. Amid rising concerns about the food supply in the United States, the Bureau of Fisheries sent Sette – who had demonstrated his ability to manage fisheries and had experience in the <b>California</b> <b>sardine</b> fishery and good contacts in the California fishing industry – to California in 1937 under a Congressional mandate to conduct sardine research that would allow better management of the Pacific sardine fishery. Sette became director of the bureau′s new South Pacific Fisheries Investigations and established the organization′s headquarters on the campus of Stanford University with instructions to [...] "direct and perform research on the nature and causes of fluctuations in pelagic fish populations.” [...] Sette quickly developed a plan {{for the study of the}} life cycle of the sardine in relation to the fishery; his plan included ecological studies of all stages of the life history of sardines as well as studies of the impact of fishing that contrasted sharply with the more narrowly focused fisheries research approach that preceded them. He enlisted the assistance of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, thereby ensuring that ecological factors would be part of the findings in his sardine investigations.|$|R
40|$|As is {{recognized}} by all fisheries students, the total catch of any species does not usually measure {{the size of}} the population available to the fishermen. The size of the total catch depends on the relation between the numbers of fish in the available population and the amount of effort expended. To measure changes in this relationship, the catch per-unit-of-effort has been devised by fisheries workers. Variations in this measure may result either from variations in {{the size of the}} total population, from differences in availability of all or a portion of the population to the fishermen, or from changes in the amount of effort expended. For an interpretation of the influence of these factors other sources of information must be drawn upon. The catch per-unit-of-effort is an essential tool, however, in the solution of the vexing problems of fisheries management. For the sardine several measures of the catch per-unit-of-effort have been calculated. The first to be published was by Hart (1933) and applied to the Canadian fishery off British Columbia. For the time interval studied, 1925 – 1932, Hart found no significant changes in the return to the fishermen for the amount of effort expended. In California several preliminary investigations yielded no dependable results, due to the fact that the supply of <b>sardines</b> off the <b>California</b> coast exceeded the demands of the industry to such an extent that catch limits were imposed on individual boats. Any changes in the return per-unit-of-effort merely reflected, therefore, increasing demands of the industry, which resulted in higher catch limits. By the early 1930 's, however, the <b>California</b> <b>sardine</b> industry had expanded to the point where it showed evidence of utilizing a large part of the available supply. Clark (1939), therefore, made a study of the return per lunar month for the Monterey and San Pedro fisheries. That investigation showed significant fluctuations with a maximum availability of the sardine population in 1934 – 35 and then a decline to a lower level in the succeeding seasons. In that investigation no attempt was made to correct for time lost to the fishermen due to unfavorable weather or to adjust for the effect of "limits" imposed on the fishing boats by the processing plants. Under good fishing conditions the fishermen can catch more fish than can be handled by the plants. To prevent gluts the processors limit the number of tons which a boat may catch on succeeding nights. Early in the history of the fishery limits were nearly always in effect. In the later years they were less important but still operating to some extent. Sette and Palmer next made a study of the San Francisco fishery which supplied the floating reduction plants operating out of that port. This study involved a preliminary analysis of the influence of weather on the catch and used an average weekly catch as the unit-of-effort. The results were in general agreement with the findings of Clark for the ports of Monterey and San Pedro. For a more thorough understanding of the relationship between the <b>California</b> <b>sardine</b> catch and the amount of effort expended, it was necessary to bring these studies up to date. In addition it was thought advisable to make an analysis of the external influences affecting the catch for which measurements were available. Also, for other studies involving variations in the sizes of fish available to the fishermen, a unit-of-effort covering a short time interval was desired. This study was undertaken, therefore, and so planned that it yielded the average weekly catch in thousands of pounds for the San Francisco, Monterey and San Pedro sardine fisheries. As far as possible this weekly catch was adjusted so as to be freed from the influence of weather, hours of darkness and of limits. The time interval covered is 1932 – 33 to 1941 – 42...|$|R

40|$|Packed like {{sardines}} in a can" is {{a familiar}} enough expression but to few persons is it known that the sardine packing business in Cornwall, England, and Brittany, France, is the life blood of commerce and the very sustenance of the fisherfolk. Nor is it much more widely known that the <b>California</b> <b>sardine</b> furnishes {{by far the largest}} output of any single fish (494, 000, 000 pounds for 1930) in the huge fishing industry of this State. Some seasons in Europe the sardine comes in enormous schools and then at other times fails to put in an appearance. A French expression "la crise sardinière" (the sardine crisis) conveys the idea that a failure takes on the proportions of a disaster, and such it is to the people who depend upon it almost solely for food and employment. As would be expected much has been written to account for the erratic habits of this fish, which is so vital to the commercial life of our State as well as certain parts of Europe. So in the hope that a collection of all the theories and the facts, both scientific and commercial, might prove of assistance to those interested, this bibliography has been compiled. The work of compiling was started by Mrs. Ruth Miller Thompson and completed by the writer after almost two years of research in eleven libraries on both the east and west coasts of the United States. Papers dealing with life history, classification, anatomy and commercial information about the sardines of the world are included. The list is as complete as possible but some papers were omitted for lack of sufficient information and doubtless others have been overlooked. The species included are Sardina pilchardus (Europe), Sardina melanosticta (Japan), Sardina ocellata (South Africa), Sardina sajax (west coast of South America), and Sardina caerulea (west coast of North America). Other names than these have crept in through synonomy and because it seemed wise to include fossil forms.

40|$|A {{knowledge}} of the localities in which fish are caught comprises an important phase {{in the investigation of}} any great fishery. Changes in the fishing grounds frequently have a significant bearing on the question of overfishing, and as a rule, the location of the fishing grounds is intimately connected with the biology of the species involved. Because of these factors, the program for the investigation of the <b>California</b> <b>sardine</b> includes the gathering of information about the locality in which individual catches are made by commercial fishermen. This investigation was inaugurated in 1919 and has been continued without interruption. The first ten years, 1919 to 1929, covered the period of rapid expansion experienced by the industry following its initial impetus furnished by the World War. The detailed findings for this time interval have been published previously. During this ten-year period the fishing grounds were rapidly extended from the local areas immediately adjacent to the canneries located at Monterey, San Pedro and San Diego to distant grounds, 30, 40, and even 60 miles from port. Because of this rapid initial growth, the succeeding seven seasons, 1929 – 30 to 1935 – 36, have seen little addition to the previously exploited fishing areas. The one exception is the development of the fishing grounds off San Francisco. In 1928 – 29 only one cannery was operating in the San Francisco region, but by 1935 – 36 the San Francisco Bay ports comprised one of the three important sardine fishing centers of the State. As a result, a fleet of boats is now operating out of San Francisco and exploiting new fishing grounds as well as fishing those frequented by Monterey boats. The grounds fished by the Monterey, San Pedro and San Diego fleets have changed but little. If in the future new canning centers are developed, new grounds adjacent to these centers will probably be utilized but it seems unlikely that any new localities will be fished extensively {{in the vicinity of the}} present canning ports. Because of this lack of change, the time is opportune to compare the areas covered by the sardine fishermen throughout the entire state and to attempt to point out the association of these fishing grounds with oceanic depth contours and with distances from ports and shore lines...|$|R
40|$|No true {{understanding}} of the <b>California</b> <b>sardine</b> fishery or of the sardine population can be reached until the size fluctuations which occur within each fishing season are clearly set forth. These rhythmic size changes, repeated with constant regularity season after season, must be analyzed and interpreted before any measure of other changes in the sardine fishery can be attempted. They result from successive movements of the various size-classes, composing the sardine population, {{into and out of}} each fishing area. In addition to these size changes within each sardine fishing season, there also occur significant size fluctuations from season to season. These result from an entirely different cause, the relative success or failure of each season's spawn. A measure of the amount of variation in the success of each season's spawning is as important as is the {{understanding of}} the size variations within each season. The size changes within each season are of greater magnitude, however, than are the size changes from season to season. Consequently the measure of the success of each spawning season must be based on an analysis which eliminates the effect of size variations within each season. The simplest {{way to do this is}} to divide each sardine season into units, each of which represents a time interval characterized by certain sized sardines. With the exception of the bait fishery and a limited canning of young fish at San Diego, the <b>California</b> <b>sardine</b> industry depends on adolescent and adult fish. These are not present in California fishing areas throughout the summer months in sufficient numbers to maintain the industry. As a result the sardine fishing season is confined to the fall, winter and early spring. In the two major fishing areas, Monterey and San Pedro, the fall fishery relies on smaller fish than does the winter fishery. Because of this consistent size difference, all recent conclusions drawn from the sardine studies have been based on a fall and a winter fishery and the two fisheries have been analyzed as distinct units. The data, so treated in this paper, demonstrate that, with few exceptions, each season the fall fish at Monterey are somewhat larger than are the fall fish at San Pedro, and the San Francisco fall fish are correspondingly larger than the Monterey fish. (There has never been a fall fishery at San Diego.) Certain superabundant year-classes have been discernible in the fishery and these groups have been traced from season to season. They have been followed through the fall fishery for three or four successive seasons until they grew to sizes larger than those taken in the fall months. These findings are interpreted as indicating that any given year-class will be taken in the fall fishery for three or four seasons only. On the other hand, the sardines from which the winter fishery draws evince quite different characteristics. They represent a much larger size range. Fish as small as those taken in the fall also are present in the winter, but in addition there occurs a high percentage of larger, older fish. In contrast to fall conditions, the winter fish at all fishing localities from San Francisco to San Diego are similar in size. The sizes have varied from season to season but for each season similar size-classes have been found in all the winter fisheries. The same superabundant year-classes discernible in the fall fishery have also been traced through the winter fishery, although the evidence is not as clear cut. But, because the winter fish comprise older as well as younger fish, these exceptionally abundant year-classes can be followed for a greater number of seasons. Some of them have been apparent for ten years or longer and have exerted a dominating influence for six or seven years. Since during the winter months all adult size-classes appear in the sardine catch, this fishery furnishes the best basis for a study of significant changes in the population and makes possible some measure of man's inroad on the supply. The length frequency polygons and deviation curves as herein presented indicate that the dominating factors influencing the changes in population abundance were, in the early years of the industry, the presence of these superabundant year-classes. These persisted in the fishery in spite of the moderately heavy toll taken by man. In the later years new superabundant groups have entered the fishery, but due to the greatly increased fishing intensity they can no longer be traced for the normal eight to ten seasons. These later groups have begun to lose their dominance in two or three years and after the third year have been below normal in abundance. This indicates that the present intense fishery is capable of reducing the number of fish of a year-class to a very low level within three or four years after the group appears in the fishery. Under normal conditions a year-class should retain sufficient numbers to make it important to the fishery for eight or ten years. This constitutes a sign of overfishing which in the near future may prove very serious...|$|R
25|$|After World War II {{ended in}} 1945, {{commercial}} {{fishing in the}} United States experienced a boom as demand for fish to feed a growing population attracted international investment. International meetings to discuss fishery issues of common interest increased in frequency and stature, and Sette was a U.S. representative at many of these. The sardine fishery quickly declined alarmingly, and in response the California state government in 1947 created a Marine Research Committee made up of fishing industry representatives, with Sette as its scientific advisor. Sette, who had pondered fluctuating fisheries since 1920, was influential in the committee′s decision to create the <b>California</b> Cooperative <b>Sardine</b> Research Program, which in 1953 was renamed the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI), in which five U.S. Government agencies, California state government agencies, and universities took part. Sette played {{a prominent role in}} planning the new effort, and in doing so made one of his greatest contributions to the maturation of fisheries science by pioneering the integration of fisheries research with that of oceanography and meteorology to gain a complete picture {{of the impact of the}} environment on fisheries.|$|R
40|$|The proper {{administration}} of any fishery {{must be based}} on a knowledge of the abundance of the species on which that fishery relies and the variations in that abundance must be measured from year to year. Seldom can the absolute abundance of a population be measured, and for a marine species practically never. The fisheries researcher has, therefore, only one recourse; he must rely on relative measures of abundance. He can not say that a given species consisted of so many individuals in year A and a certain number in year B. He can only measure the abundance of year B in terms of year A and say that the population of year B was a certain percentage more or less than year A. For measuring this ratio, fisheries workers have set up certain yardsticks and as a rule use that yardstick which is most applicable to the fishery under study. The most commonly used of these measures of changing relative abundance of a population are the return to the fisherman per unit of effort expended, the variations in the length of time a given year-class can be detected in the fishery, the variations in the proportions of largest fish in relation to all sizes, and the development of new fishing grounds when older, first exploited grounds fail to meet the demand for fish. In more recent years, the results of marking experiments indicate that such studies may constitute a trust-worthy measure of changing population abundance. Frequently, no single measure of changing abundance will tell the entire tale and the use of several measures more accurately reveals the true condition of a fish population. For the <b>sardine</b> in <b>California</b> waters certain measures have been applicable for a longer time interval than have others. The last to be indicative has been the return per unit of effort. From its inception the industry expanded rapidly and no constant unit of fishing effort was expended. Each season a larger unit was applied and no unit was comparable with the former. Only in the past five or six seasons has the industry become sufficiently stabilized to make comparable from year to year the return per unit of effort. This paper presents such a return for the Monterey and San Pedro sardine fisheries from 1932 – 33 to 1937 – 38. The unit used is based on the lunar month catches of selected boats expressed in percentages of each boat's catch for the corresponding lunar month of the previous season. The geometric mean of these percentages measures the variations in the return to the fishermen by means of the effort expended. In each locality the fishing season is made up of two more or less distinct divisions, the fall and the winter fisheries. The distinction is based on the sizes of fish caught, the fall fishery depending on smaller fish and the winter fishery on larger sizes. These fisheries have been treated separately in this study and the trends of the return per unit of effort are shown. The returns for 1932 – 33 are considered as 100 per cent and the succeeding seasons are expressed in percentages of 1932 – 33. In general the trends of all four comparisons are very similar and suggest no consistent change until 1934 – 35. In the three succeeding seasons, each year's fishing yielded less return than did the previous and in 1937 – 38 the fishermen were catching, with the same expenditure of effort, less than half as much as they had six seasons before. A decline of more than 50 per cent in the return per unit of effort indicates a rather serious decrease in the abundance of the sardine population but an additional yardstick measuring changes over a longer time interval is desirable. This {{is to be found in}} the length of time that a given year-class now remains in the fishery as compared to former years. It has not been possible to trace the history of every year-class, but certain superabundant groups are outstanding due to exceptional survival of the spawn in some seasons. The history of several of these groups has been traced. A previous publication pointed out that formerly superabundant groups could be followed through the fishery for as much as six to ten years, but by 1932 – 33 this was no longer true. Such a group, which entered the fishery in 1929 – 30, remained in the winter fishery for three seasons only. Since that time no superabundant group has maintained a definite dominance past its second year in the fishery. This would indicate that the serious decline in abundance of the sardine population began about 1930 and has continued for the succeeding eight years. At present the population has reached such a low level and is subjected to such an intense fishery that the life span of a year-class after reaching adulthood may be not more than four or five years. This is in contrast to a former adult life span of ten years or more. As the length of life of each year-class decreases, fewer fish remain to grow to larger sizes and the average length of the fish in the fishery should show a corresponding decline. For the past decade the <b>California</b> <b>sardine</b> fishery has taken approximately half its tonnage during the fall months when only the younger, smaller adults are present in the fishery. This places an excessive strain on the smaller sizes and allows fewer and fewer fish to grow to larger sizes. As a result, since 1932 – 33 there has been an almost constant decrease in the average size of the fish in the fishery. Of the measures of relative abundance as yet applied to the sardine, there remains to be discussed the expansion of the fishing grounds. During the earlier years of the <b>California</b> <b>sardine</b> fishery, the fishing grounds were constantly extended. This was possible because larger boats with a greater cruising radius were built each year. For the past ten years, although more and larger boats were still being built, the fishing grounds off the California coast have experienced little expansion. Nearly all areas where sardines are to be found from San Francisco south to San Diego were tapped by 1930. The only change in the later seasons has been heavier fishing in the more distant areas as more and more boats capable of making such extensive trips have entered the fishery and as the nearer grounds have failed to meet the demand for fish. As we have come to understand more clearly the life-history of the sardine, we realize that an expansion of the fishing grounds does not exploit new sardine populations. Various studies of the biology of the sardine have indicated that the sardine is a migratory species and the results of a tagging program now under way. Since the sardines are moving freely from one fishing ground to another, a given locality after being fished out may shortly be repopulated by a new group of fish. Conversely fishing in one locality takes its toll from the entire population rather than affecting only the population in the one locality. At present, the sardine fishermen are searching for fish along the California coast from Point Arena south to the Mexican boundary, except in the region around Point Buchon which is still too remote from markets to be profitably fished. An extensive tagging program now being carried on promises to furnish, in the future, an additional measure of the sardine population abundance. The number of tags recovered per ton of fish handled should indicate the percentage of the population caught yearly by the fishermen. The study covers too few seasons as yet to permit a report on the results...|$|R
40|$|As {{a part of}} the Marine Life Research Program of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (a {{member of}} the California Coöperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations) an {{increased}} effort is being made to describe and evaluate the various organic factors that are important in the biological economy of the sea. In attacking the problem, the most expedient procedure is to study in detail the various components of the plankton, for {{it is well known that}} these components in varying degrees of importance provide directly the basic food for the plankton-feeding fishes, such as the sardine, and also directly or indirectly for larger but less abundant pelagic fishes, as well as benthonic life. Among the several groups of zoöplankton organisms that are being studied are the euphausiid shrimp. These highly pelagic crustaceans, popularly known as “krill,” occur in large swarms in all oceans in both neritic and oceanic waters. They are considered second in importance only to the copepods as basic animal food in the sea but often exceed the copepods in mass and numbers, especially at greater depths. The present report deals with the group taxonomically on a wide geographic basis. The chief purpose here is to provide an essential tool with complete descriptions and illustrations to facilitate further study of the biology of the euphausiids and their relation to the pelagic community of the Pacific. Such a study is now under way, and it is believed that application of knowledge of the various species, their geographic ranges, concentrations, and reproductive areas will yield pertinent information relative to the importance of different oceanic currents and water masses in the marine ecology of our coasts. Among the marine animals that are known to feed upon the euphausiids are especially such fish as the herring and sardine, and also the whalebone whales whose diet is, despite their huge size, almost exclusively plankton. A literature too voluminous to review here bears this out for both the fish and mammals. The catch of baleen whales is remarkably closely correlated with the abundance and swarming of euphausiids in the Atlantic and Antarctic waters. Locally, the California gray whale is known to feed at least in part upon Euphausia pacifica, the most common euphausiid off our coast. Similarly, the humpback whales of our coast were found to have fed upon “shrimp. ” The place of euphausiids in the diet of the <b>California</b> <b>sardine</b> and other local fishes is presently under investigation in connection with the Marine Life Research program. The euphausiids are food not only to fish and other aquatic animals but to a lesser extent also to sea birds. The euphausiids usually live at depths beyond the range of surface-feeding animals, but during swarming, vast hoards may migrate to the very surface within reach of large flocks of birds. These swarmings may be within restricted areas as in the passages between Passamaquoddy Bay and the Bay of Fundy. Here Meganyctiphanes norvegica and Thysanoëssa spp. rise in the turbulent water within reach of sea gulls and other birds. On the open coast off La Jolla, California, swarms of female Thysanoëssa spinifera that had migrated to the upper water layers were swept ashore and stranded upon the beach. In Australian waters “rafts” of Nyctiphanes australis, covering an acre in extent, may occur at the surface where they are fed upon by the muttonbird. Finally, euphausiids may hold a place directly in the diet of man himself. Japanese fishermen sometimes catch vast numbers of these crustaceans, which periodically swarm in the deep bays of Honshu Island. The niche occupied by the euphausiids in the food chain of the sea requires also a consideration of the food upon which they themselves subsist. Some progress along this line has been made by various workers. Much remains to be done. Einarsson (1945) reviews briefly pertinent literature which brings evidence to show that the diet of euphausiids consists of both diatoms and microcrustaceans, but chiefly of the phytoplankton diatoms. Floating detritus is also an item of diet, but further study is needed in determining the efficiency of the feeding mechanisms in screening out the very finest particulate organic material known to be present in the sea water. The feeding mechanism of the euphausiids consists of a basket formed by the thoracic appendages, the inner margins of which are provided with long plumose bristles or setae. Water is strained through the bristles, and the small organisms and detritus are screened out as the animal swims through the water propelled by the swimming feet (pleopods) on the abdomen. Important also are the mouth parts. The mouth parts are situated immediately in front of the thoracic appendages. From anterior to posterior, they consist of labrum, mandibles (with “teeth” and palps), labia, first maxillae, and second maxillae. There are no maxillipeds differing from the thoracic appendages. The first and second maxillae are small, but they are well provided with many rather short setae and spines which are apparently used mainly in holding or transferring food particles to the labia and mandibles. The active feeding process of euphausiids was not studied but, from consideration of the structure of the feeding mechanisms, it appears that at least in Euphausia pacifica an important nonscreening device is the pair of mandibular palps. These palps are designed to move the food particles from the basket and maxillae into reach of the labia and mandibles and doubtless to hold larger particles against the mandibles during mastication. The end segment of each palp is provided with a row of strong, curved spines along the posterior edge. The palps are rotated somewhat toward the mid-line to show the orientation of the spines. In Nematoscelis difficilis the mandibular palps are much shorter and may therefore serve a more restricted function. In the genus the second pair of thoracic legs are enormously elongated, but it is not clear with what feeding function this modification may be associated. Although much of the food material consists of detrital particles or organisms of very small size, this is only a fraction of the diet. Larger objects such as copepod larvae, and even adults, form {{a part of the}} food of Meganyctiphanes norvegica. The well-developed mandibles with chitinized gnathobase attest to this fact. They are each provided with a cutting incisor process and a molar process useful in crushing...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{historical}} fishing records to understand relationships between climatic change and fish abundance {{is limited by}} the relatively short duration of these records, and complications due to the strong influence of human activity in addition to climatic change. Sedimentary records containing scales, bones or geochemical proxies of variability in fish populations provide unique insights on long-term ecosystem dynamics and relationships with climatic change. Available records from Holocene sediments are summarized and synthesized. The records are from several widespread locations near or along the continental margins of the South Atlantic and Pacific oceans, including Alaska, USA (Pacific salmon), Saanich and Effingham Inlets, British Columbia, Canada (pelagic fish), Santa Barbara Basin, California, USA (Northern anchovies and Pacific <b>sardines),</b> Gulf of <b>California,</b> Mexico (Pacific <b>sardines,</b> Northern anchovies and Pacific hake), Peru upwelling system (sardines, anchovies and hake). and Benguela Current System, South Africa (sardines, anchovies and hake). These records demonstrate that fish population sizes are not constant, and varied significantly over a range of time scales prior to the advent of large-scale commercial fishing. In addition to the decadal-scale variability commonly observed in historical records, the long-term records reveal substantial variability over centennial and millennial time scales. Shifts in abundance are often, but not always, correlated with regional and/or global climatic changes. The long-term perspective reveals different patterns of variability in fish populations, as well as fish-climate relationships, than suggested by analysis {{of historical}} records. Many records suggest prominent changes in fish abundance at ca. 1000 - 1200 AD, during the Little Ice Age, and during the transition {{at the end of the}} Little Ice Age in the 19 th century that may be correlative, and that were likely driven by major hemispheric or global reorganizations in the earth's climate system. Additional sedimentary records of marine fish abundance and corresponding paleoenvironmental conditions are likely to further enhance our understanding of marine ecosystem dynamics.

40|$|The sardine {{population}} {{along the}} Pacific Coast of North America {{is subject to}} large fluctuations in the survival of sardines from each season's spawning. This results in some very abundant year classes, some very sparse and some of intermediate strengths. The relative abundance of each year class {{can be measured in}} its second or third year when it is first taken in the commercial fishery but it is of material help to the industry and to the biologist to know the abundance of each year class as early as possible. The California Department of Fish and Game has attempted to measure such abundance by surveys along the coast in the late summer and fall months when a new year class of sardines is about six months old. The first exploratory surveys were conducted in California and Mexican waters during the fall months of 1938, 1939 and 1940. These were discontinued because the correlation between the observed abundance of young fish on the nursery grounds and the subsequent abundance of these fish in the commercial catch was not in good agreement. This was due in part to lack of certain equipment, such as recording echo-sounders, which were not in general use at that time, and in part to an exceptional spawning in 1939 north of the area covered by the survey. This resulted in a serious underestimate of the abundance of the 1939 year class. Since the earlier survey, the need for a knowledge of the strength of incoming age groups has become even greater. The older sardines, which acted as a buffer against wide fluctuations in the strength of individual year classes, are no longer on the fishing grounds. As a result the industry is dependent upon younger fish, and a weakened fishery now exists which yields a widely fluctuating harvest, varying as varies the abundance and distribution of young sardines one to three years old. There have been many new developments since the earlier surveys that aid in collecting and compiling the data. The evaluation of the strength of year classes is now possible through the development of a method of age determination. The relative abundance of a year class can now be traced from its first appearance in the commercial catch until it is no longer taken in the fishery. During the surveys sardines of all age groups can be collected and their estimated abundance checked against similar estimates from the commercial catch. The <b>California</b> Cooperative <b>Sardine</b> Research Program {{under the auspices of the}} Marine Research Committee is collecting data regarding concentrations of sardine eggs and larvae throughout the distribution of the sardine. This information about the location of sardine spawn is collected each season prior to the beginning of the young fish survey and the range of the survey can be established thereby. This should prevent omission from the survey of the nursery grounds to the north or south of the usual spawning area as occurred for a major part of the 1939 year class. New tools are also most useful. The development of radar has been of great help in allowing the vessel to work closer inshore at night. It also makes it possible to define more accurately the locations where fish are found. The echo-sounder aids in finding schools which cannot be located visually. Although the earlier surveys are not directly comparable with the later, some marked differences in the two time periods are evident. The most striking is the greater abundance of young sardines in all areas in 1938 – 40 than in 1950 – 51. Although this is most apparent in Central and Southern California it is also true for the Baja California region. There is no indication that lack of <b>sardines</b> in <b>California</b> waters in the later years has been compensated by an increase in abundance off Baja California. The maximum surface temperatures where sardine schools were found are similar for both time intervals. The 1938, 1939 and 1940 surveys were extended farther south than the 1950 and 1951 cruises but sardines were not found at temperatures greater than 26. 1 ° C. In the later surveys the highest temperature at which sardines were found was 25. 7 ° C. The maximum surface temperature encountered on all cruises was 28. 3 ° C. The later cruises recorded minimum temperatures as low as 10. 4 ° C. but no sardines were located at temperatures below 11. 4 ° C. The lowest temperature on the earlier cruises was 11. 7 ° C...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a truly {{marvelous}} development of the <b>sardine</b> fishery in <b>California.</b> Although it originated as a great fishery during the stress of war, the industry has shown a vitality which augurs well for its permanence {{so long as the}} raw material is obtainable. The amount caught exceeds by far that taken of any other species in California, and there appears at present no other which is capable of the tremendous yield, unless it be the unused anchovy. Experience with older fisheries has shown that rational use demands a knowledge of at least two things. There must, above all else, be information from time to time regarding {{the manner in which the}} species is withstanding the strain of the fishery. But there must also be an understanding of the natural changes in abundance which inevitably occur, so that these may be distinguished from the effects of overfishing and also may be foretold and understood. Based on such knowledge regulation and exploitation may be rational and restrained. To this end we must concern ourselves principally with the commercial catch, in which lies mankind's major interest. In so doing we meet at once the problem of accurately recording that catch and then of analyzing the complex underlying the biologic and economic conditions. It is hoped that the program which {{has been a}}dopted for this purpose by the State of California will prove by further experience to be sound and to lead far. Begun as a simple introduction, this paper was at first intended merely to give the background of our investigations. It has been expanded to include a discussion of several things fundamentally important to our purposes, and this discussion portrays rather imperfectly the viewpoint acquired by actual experience with the Pacific sardine. The investigation has, indeed, molded and directed our first ideas and methods. The purposes of the investigation were the seemingly simple ones of detecting depletion caused by overfishing and of following the great natural changes—which might be foretold were our work extensive and precise enough. The complexity of the problem has become increasingly apparent, and has necessitated a careful consideration as to what our sampling really consists of. As this sampling is the proposed basis for a necessarily long continued program of observation, it deserves careful analysis. When, in attacking our problems, we sought for aid from the existing literature on the European sardine, there were found plain evidences of the same complexity in the phenomena attending the fishery for that species. This complexity we regard as indicating the necessity for the type of program adopted. And in making use of what information existed as regards this European species, we have found it necessary to define somewhat closely the real relationships of the <b>California</b> and European <b>sardines.</b> The constant comparison that is inevitable should rest on a sound foundation. It would seem, incidentally, that the degree of relationship in habits might correspond roughly to the degree of relationship in structure. But as to the truth of such a surmise little can be said at present, since sufficient knowledge of habits is lacking in both species. Perhaps the advance of science will change this situation...|$|R
