5|$|As VT74 {{returns to}} the rural {{countryside}} it bends toward the northeast {{for most of the}} distance to <b>Cornwall.</b> Through this stretch the highway winds through forests and occasional farmland. VT74 straightens at an intersection with Bates Road. A connector road called North Palmer Road merges with VT74 shortly afterward. VT74 winds again for a stretch and straightens a second time near the intersection with Elmendorf Road as it continues toward <b>Cornwall,</b> intersecting with several township highways and approaching increasingly residential areas. At Clark Road in <b>Cornwall,</b> VT74 turns to the northeast once again, passing through more forests before terminating at VT30 in <b>Cornwall.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Cornwall,</b> {{represented}} by the <b>Cornwall</b> Commonwealth Games Association (CCGA), sent a bid {{for participation in the}} 2006 Commonwealth Games, however, their application was rejected by the CGF, who stated that the constitutional status of <b>Cornwall</b> was not an issue that should be resolved through this medium. However, in 2010, the CCGA sought to launch a legal challenge to the decision of the CGF, stating that the Cornish bid of 2006 fulfilled the entire criterion of the CGF, and by rejecting the bid, the CGF had violated their own code, failing to follow their own criteria for participation. The <b>Cornwall</b> team will therefore seek competition in the 2014 games.|$|E

5|$|For {{at least}} 3,000 years from antiquity {{until the late}} 20thcentury mining of tin and copper played a {{significant}} part in the economy of <b>Cornwall.</b> <b>Cornwall,</b> {{the northern part of}} Iberia and the Ore Mountains (the modern border between the Czech Republic and Germany) are the only places in Europe in which major tin deposits are found near the surface. As tin is an essential ingredient of bronze, <b>Cornwall</b> was of great economic significance in Bronze Age Europe despite its relative isolation. Mining by the Roman Empire led to the Iberian mines becoming depleted by the 3rd centuryAD, leaving <b>Cornwall</b> and neighbouring Devon the most significant sources of tin in Europe. While it appears from surviving evidence that after the decline of the Bronze Age civilisations copper production ceased in <b>Cornwall,</b> it seems that the tin mines were in continuous operation throughout the Roman period and the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Members of the CPA {{made about}} 87 million pasties in 2008, amounting to sales of £60 million (about 6% {{of the food}} economy of <b>Cornwall).</b> In 2011, over 1,800 {{permanent}} staff were employed {{by members of the}} CPA and some 13,000 other jobs benefited from the trade.

5|$|<b>Cornwall,</b> {{named to}} commemorate the English county, was laid down at Pembroke Royal Dockyard, Wales, on 11 March 1901, and {{launched}} on 29 October 1902.
