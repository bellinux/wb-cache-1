50|$|Test call {{generators}} (TCGs) are {{revenue assurance}} solutions that replicate events on a telecoms network to identify potential revenue leakage {{and to help}} achieve regulatory compliance. Both cellular and fixed-line telecom operators utilise test call generators to independently test their networks for <b>call</b> <b>detail</b> <b>record</b> (<b>CDR)</b> reconciliation and validate call start-time/duration metering and telecommunications rating. TCGs are mission-critical tools utilised by telecom operator revenue assurance departments to improve revenue capture and to validate network integrity.|$|E
50|$|A <b>call</b> <b>detail</b> <b>record</b> (<b>CDR)</b> is a {{data record}} {{produced}} by a telephone exchange or other telecommunications equipment that documents {{the details of a}} telephone call or other telecommunications transaction (e.g., text message) that passes through that facility or device. The record contains various attributes of the call, such as time, duration, completion status, source number, and destination number.

50|$|The {{primary reason}} for answer and {{disconnect}} supervision is for billing. The telephone company and the customer need an accurate accounting of calls.

Inter Operator Identifier (IOI) is a globally unique identifier shared between sending and receiving networks. Each domain has its own charging network. Billing systems in different domains will also exchange information, so that roaming charges can be applied.|$|E
5000|$|Lawful Intercept and Monitoring, {{abbreviated}} to LIM, is a clandestine mass electronic surveillance program deployed by the Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DOT), an Indian Government owned telecommunications technology development centre. LIM systems {{are used by}} the Indian Government to intercept records of voice, SMSs, GPRS data, details of a subscriber's application and recharge history and <b>call</b> <b>detail</b> <b>record</b> (<b>CDR)</b> [...] and monitor Internet traffic, emails, web-browsing, Skype and any other Internet activity of Indian users. Mobile operators deploy their own LIM system which allows the government to intercept calls, after taking “due authorisation” in compliance with Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act read with Rule 419(A) of the IT Rules. The LIM system to monitor Internet traffic is deployed by the government at the international gateways of some large ISPs (between the ISPs Internet Edge Router (PE) and the core network). These surveillance systems are under complete control of the government, and their functioning is secretive and unknown to the ISPs.|$|E

Motivated by the telco <b>Call</b> <b>detail</b> <b>record</b> (<b>CDR),</b> Argus attempts to generate network metadata {{that can be used}} to perform a large number of network management tasks. Argus is used by many universities, corporations and government entities including US DISA, DoD, DHS, FFRDCs, GLORIAD and is a Top 100 Internet Security Tool. [...] Argus is designed to be a real-time situational awareness system, and its data can be used to track, alarm and alert on wire-line network conditions. The data can also be used to establish a comprehensive audit of all network traffic, as described in the Red Book, US DoD NCSC-TG-005, supplementing traditional Intrusion detection system (IDS) based network security. [...] The audit trail is traditionally used as historical network traffic measurement data for network forensics and Network Behavior Anomaly Detection (NBAD).

The approach can identify users’ home and work locations {{as well as other}} places (e. g., associated to leisure and night life). We evaluated our approach threefold: (i) on the basis of groundtruth information coming from a fraction of users whose relevant places were known, (ii) by comparing the resulting number of inhabitants of a given city with the number of inhabitants as extracted by the national census. (iii) Via stability analysis to verify the consistency of the extracted results across multiple time periods. Results show the effectiveness of our approach with an average 90 % precision and recall...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the design, {{implementation}} and experimental evaluation of Kerberos, an architecture {{for the detection}} of frauds in current generation Voice over IP (VoIP) networks. Kerberos is fed by an On-line Charging System (OCS) generating events associated with the setup, evolution and tear-down of end-user calls in a VoIP network compliant with the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) specification. Such events are properly correlated in order to identify, in real-time, patterns associated with a fraudulent utilization of the Operator's resources. The detection phase can in turn trigger the subsequent remediation actions. Communication between the OCS and Kerberos is based on an asynchronous paradigm, whereas event correlation and analysis are effectively realized through a Complex Event Processing approach. The paper will shed light on both the design and the implementation of the system, whose performance is then evaluated by relying on a real-world dataset of <b>Call</b> <b>Detail</b> <b>Record</b> (<b>CDR)</b> events provided by Tiscali, a well known Italian Operator...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Telecommunication {{applications}} {{based on}} user modeling focus on extracting customer behavior and preferences {{from the information}} implicitly included in <b>Call</b> <b>Detail</b> <b>Record</b> (<b>CDR)</b> datasets. Even though {{there are many different}} application areas (fraud detection, viral and targeted marketing, churn prediction, etc.) they all share a common data source (CDRs) and a common set of features for modeling the user. In this paper we present our experience with different applications areas in generating user models from massive real datasets of both mobile phone and landline subscriber activity. We present the analysis of a dataset containing the traces of 50, 000 mobile phone users and 50, 000 landline users from the same geographical area for a period of six months and compare the different behaviors when using landlines and mobile phones and the implications that such differences have for each application. Our results indicate that user models for a variety of applications can be generated efficiently and in a homogeneous way using an architecture based on distributed computing and that there are numerous differences between mobile phone and landline users that have relevant practical implications. ...|$|E
40|$|A <b>call</b> <b>detail</b> <b>record</b> (<b>CDR)</b> is a {{data record}} {{produced}} by telecommunication equipment consisting of call detail transaction logs. It contains valuable information for many purposes in several domains, such as billing, fraud detection and analytical purposes. However, {{in the real world}} these needs face a big data challenge. Billions of CDRs are generated every day and the processing systems are expected to deliver results in a timely manner. The capacity of our current production system is not enough to meet these needs. Therefore a better performing system based on MapReduce and running on Hadoop cluster was designed and implemented. This paper presents an analysis of the previous system and the design and implementation of the new system, called MS 2. In this paper also empirical evidence is provided to demonstrate the efficiency and linearity of MS 2. Tests have shown that MS 2 reduces overhead by 44 % and speeds up performance nearly twice compared to the previous system. From benchmarking with several related technologies in large-scale data processing, MS 2 was also shown to perform better in the case of CDR batch processing.   When it runs on a cluster consisting of eight CPU cores and two conventional disks, MS 2 is able to process 67, 000 CDRs/second...|$|E
