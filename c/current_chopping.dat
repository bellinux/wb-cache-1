50|$|The {{contacts}} {{carry the}} circuit current when closed, and form the terminals of the arc when opening the circuit. Contacts {{are made of}} different materials depending on {{the application of the}} vacuum interrupter and selection of the design for long contact life, rapid recovery of voltage withstand rating, and control of over-voltage due to <b>current</b> <b>chopping.</b>|$|E
50|$|Under certain {{circumstances}} the {{vacuum circuit breaker}} can force the current in the circuit to zero, before the natural zero and reversal of current in the alternating current circuit. Additionally, if the timing of interrupter operation is unfavorable {{with respect to the}} ac voltage waveform, when the arc has extinguished but the contacts are still moving and ionization has not yet dissipated in the interrupter, the applied voltage may exceed the withstand voltage of the gap. This can cause reignition of the arc and abrupt transient currents. In either of these cases, oscillations are introduced in the system, and may result in significant overvoltage. Manufacturers of vacuum interrupters address these concerns by selection of contact materials and contact designs selected to minimize <b>current</b> <b>chopping.</b> To protect apparatus from overvoltages, vacuum switchgear assemblies will usually include surge arrester components to prevent damaging over voltage.|$|E

40|$|The {{switched}} {{reluctance motor}} (SRM) drives {{have been widely used}} in aircraft applications due to the motor advantages like high speed operation, simple construction, no windings on rotor.

In this report {{vacuum circuit breaker}} in small-scale hydropower stations with the rated power 4 MVA and below has been studied. Models of the stations are modeled and analyzed in PSCAD/EMTDC to study the high voltage transients that are created after <b>current</b> <b>chopping</b> with vacuum circuit breaker. Vacuum circuit breaker may chop the current before it reaches zero value, which means that high voltage transients can be created. The equipment of the stations can be destroyed by high voltage transients. The purpose of this thesis {{is to examine the}} use of vacuum circuit breaker in small-scale hydropower stations and the risk for high voltage transients from <b>current</b> <b>chopping.</b> According to the results there is a risk of high voltage transients after <b>current</b> <b>chopping</b> with small synchronous generators in stations with the operating voltages 0. 4 kV and 3. 6 kV. When the vacuum circuit breaker is placed on the high voltage side of the transformer the risk increases of high voltages transients and reignitions due to the low capacitance of the transformer. The conclusions is that high voltage transients occurs when the vacuum circuit breaker chops the current at a high chopping level in stations where the synchronous generator rated power is low, high rated voltage and a small capacitance. The risks of high voltage transients in small-scale hydropower stations can be reduced with surge arrester, RC-circuits or protective capacitors. The report is written in Swedish...|$|E

50|$|The pseudospark switch, {{also known}} as a cold-cathode {{thyratron}} due to the similarities with regular thyratrons, is a gas-filled tube capable of high speed switching. Advantages of pseudospark switches include the ability to carry reverse currents (up to 100%), low pulse, high lifetime, and a high current rise of about 1012 A/sec. In addition, since the cathode is not heated prior to switching, the standby power is approximately one order of magnitude lower than in thyratrons. However, pseudospark switches have undesired plasma phenomena at low peak currents. Issues such as <b>current</b> quenching, <b>chopping,</b> and impedance fluctuations occur at currents less than 2-3 kA while at very high peak currents (20-30 kA) a transition to a metal vapor arc occurs which leads to erosion of the electrodes.

40|$|The oxygen {{evolution}} reaction (OER) at {{the surface}} of semiconductor photoanodes is critical for photoelectrochemical water splitting. This reaction involves photo-generated holes that oxidize water via charge transfer at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. However, a certain fraction of the holes that reach the surface recombine with electrons from the conduction band, giving rise to the surface recombination loss. The charge transfer efficiency, Zt, defined as the ratio between the flux of holes {{that contribute to the}} water oxidation reaction and the total flux of holes that reach the surface, is an important parameter that helps to distinguish between bulk and surface recombination losses. However, accurate determination of Zt by conventional voltammetry measurements is complicated because only the total current is measured {{and it is difficult to}} discern between different contributions to the <b>current.</b> <b>Chopped</b> light measurement (CLM) and hole scavenger measurement (HSM) techniques are widely employed to determine Zt, but they often lead to errors resulting from instrumental as well as fundamental limitations. Intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) is better suited for accurate determination of Zt because it provides direct information on both the total photocurrent and the surface recombination current. However, careful analysis of IMPS measurements at different light intensities is required to account for nonlinear effects. This work compares the Zt values obtained by these methods using heteroepitaxial thinfilm hematite photoanodes as a case study. We show that a wide spread of Zt values is obtained by different analysis methods, and even within the same method different values may be obtained depending on instrumental and experimental conditions such as the light source and light intensity. Statistical analysis of the results obtained for our model hematite photoanode show good correlation between different methods for measurements carried out with the same light source, light intensity and potential. However, there is a considerable spread in the results obtained by different methods. For accurate determination of Zt, we recommend IMPS measurements in operando with a bias light intensity such that the irradiance is as close as possible to the AM 1. 5 Global solar spectrum...|$|R

The gravity, buoyancy and drag force acting on the wave energy converter (WEC) are all analyzed. The analytical expression of the torque applied on the rotor is given based on a linear model of the switched reluctance generator (SRG). The SRG usually rotates with low velocity in the WEC system. In this situation, <b>current</b> <b>chopping</b> control (CCC) is adopted with fixed turn-on angle and turn-off angle control mode to have a quick response for SRG.

Then maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of system is achieved. A simulation model is developed in MATLAB for the bidirectional driven float-type wave power generation system with real wave statistical characteristics taken into account. Simulation results show that the WEC can output desired torque periodically with high efficiency and good adaptability. Therefore, the feasibility of applying a SRG in a WEC is also verified.|$|E
