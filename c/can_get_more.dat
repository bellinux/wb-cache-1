He {{has said that he}} favours playing in the centre because he <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> of the ball and influence play more than when he is on the left. He is a naturally attacking player and when playing in the centre he makes runs to and beyond the striker which adds an extra dimension to his team's play.|$|E

Jack Brad, writing for Hive Magazine, said the song was a [...] "fun and funky" [...] track showcasing a different musical direction for the band. He also said it encompassed a [...] "catchy melody and...infectious chorus" [...] that proves the band was capable of experimenting with new musical styles on every new production, citing Warning (2000) and Nimrod (1997) as examples.

Semigran went further {{and said it was}} the [...] "best number by far", and Hankinson went beyond that: [...] "it may be one of my favorite Gleeformances of all time". Futterman called it [...] "fun" [...] and [...] "flirty", and noted that [...] "it pits Glee most well-rounded pop vocalists against each other". Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times and Gonzalez both gave the performance an [...] "A"; Benigno wrote that [...] "it sounds like a modernized version of an old song and it totally, 1000% works", and Gonzalez declared that [...] "Blaine needs to join New Directions so we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> duets between him and Rachel". Harper, while she characterized it as a [...] "really cute duet", said she was [...] "not super-keen on seeing them pair up again". Brett Berk of Vanity Fair was even less enthusiastic, and gave it two stars out of five.|$|E

500|$|Bagwell's power hike piqued {{the curiosity}} of many {{baseball}} observers. [...] In two minor league seasons from 1989–90, {{he had managed}} six home runs in 932 at bats–a ratio of 155 at bats per home run (AB/HR). [...] With 15 HR {{in his first year}} in Houston, that average shrunk to 36.9. [...] He also exhibited extraordinary plate discipline for a rookie: while ranking tenth in the league in walks with 75, his OBP placed fifth at [...]387. [...] Of the power surge, commented Bagwell to hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo, [...] "That's awesome", to which he reacted, [...] "Awesome? [...] We <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> out of you than that." [...] By altering an approach to contact the pitch with topspin as he did when he arriving to Houston, Jaramillo taught Bagwell to hit with backspin, resulting in a soaring trajectory rather than nose diving. [...] He also habituated Bagwell to manipulate the count, waiting for a pitch to drive instead of indiscriminately swinging at any pitch that appeared to be a strike. [...] Accounted Bagwell of the newfound advantage, [...] "I didn’t hit many home runs in the minor leagues, but when I hit one, when I got backspin on it, it went a long way." ...|$|E

2500|$|A new cricket ball {{is harder}} than a worn one, and is {{preferred}} by fast bowlers {{because of the}} speed and bounce of the ball off the pitch. Older balls tend to spin more as the roughness grips the pitch more when the ball bounces, so spin bowlers prefer to use a worn ball, though a ball of about 8-10 overs old is still useful to a spinner as it <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> drift in the air. Uneven wear on older balls may also make reverse swing possible. [...] A captain may delay the request for a new ball if he prefers to have his spin bowlers operating, but usually asks for the new ball soon after it becomes available.|$|E
