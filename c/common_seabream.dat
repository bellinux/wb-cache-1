Moreover, the lack of previous records of this species over the past century, together with the absence of lineage separation and the presence of relatively few private alleles, do not exclude the possibility of an even more recent colonisation event.

40|$|Lipid {{classes and}} fatty acid {{composition}} of polar (phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine) and neutral (triglycerides) lipid fractions of <b>common</b> two-banded <b>seabream</b> (Diplodus vulgaris, L.) and sea eel (Conger conger, L.) originating from the Adriatic Sea (the [ibenik basin) were determined. Total lipid content in C. conger (3. 7 ± 0. 2 %) was {{almost three times}} higher than in D. vulgaris (1. 3 ± 0. 2 %). Polar lipids in D. vulgaris were almost twice as high (28. 1 ± 4. 2 %) as in C. conger (15. 5 ± 0. 2 %). Neutral lipids were present in higher proportions (71. 9 ± 4. 2 %) in D. vulgaris and (84. 5 ± 0. 2 %) in C. conger. The fatty acid composition of triglycerides was much more complex than those of polar lipid fractions. There were 25 identified fatty acids in Diplodus vulgaris and 23 identified fatty acids in Conger conger muscle tissue samples. Palmitic (16 : 0, 20. 3 – 63. 9 %), stearic (18 : 0, 5. 5 – 58. 7 %) and oleic (18 : 1 n- 9 c, 3. 8 – 23. 1 %) acid were the most abundant fatty acids in both analysed fish species, but their amounts differed significantly. Appreciable quantities of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA 22 : 6 n- 3, 0. 5 – 15. 4 %), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA 20 : 5 n- 3, 1. 2 – 5. 3 %), arachidonic acid (20 : 4 n- 6, 0. 7 – 7. 8 %) and tetracosaeonic acid (24 : 1 n- 9, 0. 7 – 4. 8 %) were also found. EPA + DHA values were much higher in the Conger conger lipid fractions in comparison with Diplodus vulgaris lipid fractions, except for phosphatidylethanolamine. Our study points out that both fish species contain appreciable levels of n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and would therefore be suitable for highly unsaturated low-fat diets...|$|R
40|$|Background. There is {{need for}} more {{information}} on behavioural rhythms of fishes in relation to their habitat use in few or not previously monitored areas, such as coralligenous habitats. Some studies have compiled inventories of observable fish species in this habitat, but no studies have been performed on the temporal patterning of fish behaviour, especially at the scale of the day. The presently reported study aims at providing knowledge on finescale fluctuations of abundances and behaviour of two fish species in coralligenous habitats throughout the diurnal period. Materials and methods. Fish fauna was filmed hourly, for several days, from dusk to dawn, with autonomous, programmable, and rotating video systems. Diurnal variations in abundances per count, considering size classes and behaviour, were studied for two diurnal fish species-the Mediterranean rainbow wrasse, Coris julis (Linnaeus, 1758) (Labridae), and the <b>common</b> two-banded <b>seabream,</b> Diplodus vulgaris (Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1817) (Sparidae) in two study areas of coralligenous habitats on the French Riviera. Results. Significant temporal variability at the scale of the hour was revealed for abundances of C. julis in one of the two study areas, with few individuals in crepuscular periods and highest abundances in the morning and in the afternoon. These differences were mainly due to significant diurnal variations in abundances of small and medium C. julis, which were low in crepuscular periods, whereas large-sized individuals were equally abundant during the day. On the other hand, no discernible diurnal rhythmicity of mean abundances of D. vulgaris was observed, regardless of the study area. Crepuscular periods were associated with sudden changes of abundances and behaviour for both species, with a greater percentage of mobile and solitary individuals, and few feeding individuals compared {{to the rest of the}} day. Feeding occurred mainly in the morning for C. julis. In contrast, no dial-time preference for feeding was revealed for D. vulgaris. Conclusions. The study provided preliminary insights into fine-scale diurnal variations of abundances of different life stages and of fish behaviour. Variability in abundances of life stages and of fish behaviours at different times of day should be taken into account for population assessments and spatial comparisons. Moreover, our study confirmed the use of video-imaging as an efficient non-destructive tool for the study of fish fauna in structurally complex, highly valuable habitats...|$|R
40|$|Aquaculture is {{a growing}} {{agricultural}} sector that due to the actual market saturation by sea bass and gilthead sea bream, needs for new fish species diversification. Sparid fishes are important candidates for species diversification in the Mediterranean aquaculture. Under culture conditions, parasites may cause serious problems. This thesis aims to improve our knowledge of myxozoan and aporocotylid parasites in sparids which are new candidates or existing Mediterranean aquaculture species. The present study seeks to identify, describe and clarify the taxonomic position of the parasite taxa by morphological and molecular approaches, and by defining their phylogenetical position and relationship with previously described species. Development, habitat selection in the host and pathology are analysed in order to evaluate the pathogenic potential of the parasites described. Also this thesis focuses {{on the study of}} parasite life cycles, seasonality, transmission and routes of infection in the fish host, with the final aim to provide information allowing for the development of management strategies for aquaculture systems. The study led to the following findings and conclusions: -A new genus and species of blood fluke, Skoulekia meningialis n. gen., n. sp. was described from the <b>common</b> two-banded <b>seabream</b> Diplodus vulgaris in a non common location, the ectomeningeal veins surrounding the optic lobes of the brain. The adults of S. meningialis were found to cause mild, chronic, localised meningitis. Its special location surrounding a vital organ should be kept in mind when establishing D. vulgaris in aquaculture systems. -Large cysts of myxosporean spores of the species Unicapsula pflugfelderi were detected in the fillets of sand steenbras Lithognathus mormyrus. Myoliquefaction process was not found to occur in U. pflugfelderi. However, the massive presence of macroscopic plasmodia in the fillets of L. mormyrus could produce marketing problems, affecting to the potential of the sand steenbras as an aquaculture candidate. -A new myxozoan parasite Ceratomyxa puntazzi n. sp. was found to cause histopathological changes in the liver and in the gall bladder of the sharpsnout seabream Diplodus puntazzo and has to be considered as an opportunistic parasite in immunocompromised hosts. The genus Ceratomyxa seems to be very host-specific in sparids and high species diversity can be expected in Mediterranean sparids. The phylogenetical analyses revealed that all ceratomyxid species of sparids from the Mediterranean rise from a common ancestor. -This thesis provides unique insights into the development and cellular organisation of the myxozoan C. puntazzi. This study is the first use of confocal laser scanning microscopy with specific stains on developmental stages of a myxozoan. C. puntazzi seems to follow a sequence of development with two pathways in the bile: pre-sporogonic proliferative development where stages show high degree of motility, cellular divisions and budding by plasmotomy, and sporogonic development, characterized by the formation and maturation of spores. For the first time in myxozoans, motility and the distribution of potential effectors of motility were analysed. F-actin rich cytoskeletal elements were found to concentrate {{at one end of the}} parasite, which produces localised filopodia, thus facilitating parasite motility. The mechanism of budding was identified, for the first time, as an active F-actin dependent separation process. -Natural exposures of sharpsnout seabream to a C. puntazzi enzootic habitat are the first attempt of conducting a seasonality study in marine myxozoans and provide important insights into the seasonal patterns of myxozoan abundance in a temperate marine environment. C. puntazzi infection in the bile shows a marked temperature-related seasonality, with visual detection of parasites exclusively between April - November. However, PCR detection in the bile is possible all year round. Blood stages were detected all year round by PCR. This indicates that actinospores are present in the sea water and the blood of exposed fish is invaded throughout the whole year. Implications for D. puntazzo culture are discussed. La acuicultura mediterránea necesita diversificación de especies de peces para el cultivo debido a la saturación del mercado con dorada y lubina. En condiciones de cultivo, los peces pueden verse afectados por diversos patógenos, entre ellos los parásitos. Entre los parásitos mas problemáticos en la acuicultura mediterránea, figuran los mixozoos y los aporocotílidos. En esta tesis doctoral se presentan nuevas y se aportan nuevos datos de especies ya descritas de estos dos grupos parásitos, se estudia la relación parasito-hospedador y se incluyen nuevos datos del desarrollo, rutas de infección, ciclo de vida y estacionalidad en especies de peces candidatas para el cultivo. Un nuevo género y especie de aporocotílido Skoulekia meningialis n. gen. n. sp. se halló en un hábitat poco común, las venas ectomeningeales del cerebro de la mojarra Diplodus vulgaris, donde los adultos provocan una meningitis moderada pero crónica. Plasmodios alargados con esporas del mixozoo Unicapsula pflugfelderi se hallaron en la musculatura de la herrera Lithognathus mormyrus y aunque no se observó mioliquefaccion, la presencia masiva de estas estructuras en los filetes puede afectar al potencial de la herrera como especie para la acuicultura. Ceratomyxa puntazzi n. sp. es una nueva especie de mixozoo descrita de la vesícula biliar del sargo picudo Diplodus puntazzo. C. puntazzi provoca cambios histopatológicos en el hígado y la vesícula biliar del sargo picudo y debe considerarse como un patógeno oportunista. C. puntazzi forma parte del complejo de especies del género Ceratomyxa hallado en espáridos del Mediterráneo los cuales provienen de un ancestro común. Dentro del estudio de C. puntazzi, se describen los componentes celulares, y los mecanismos que intervienen en la motilidad de los mixozoos y como estos elementos están implicados en los procesos de gemación y citocinesis en los mixozoos. Experimentos de transmisión con jaulas en el mar a un medio natural enzoótico para C. puntazzi reveló una estacionalidad marcada, con presencia de esporas en la bilis de Abril a Noviembre, pero con detección por PCR durante todo el año tanto en la bilis como en la sangre. Estos resultados tienen implicaciones para el manejo del cultivo del sargo picudo...|$|R
