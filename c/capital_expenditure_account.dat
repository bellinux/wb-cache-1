40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> and gross fixed capital formation in Nigeria. The study made use of secondary data covering the period 1981 to 2011. A least square regression analysis was carried out on a time series data, and to avert the emergence of spurious results, unit root tests were conducted. Other econometric tools of co- integration, Vector Auto Regression technique as well as Granger causality tests were deployed to ascertain the order of co integration {{and the level of}} relationships existing between the dependent and independent variables. Findings of study reveal that while <b>Capital</b> <b>Expenditures</b> (CAPEX) maintained a negative significant relationship with Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in Nigeria at both 1 % and 5 % Alpha levels; Imports and National Savings had a positive significant relationship with GFCF at both the short and long runs. It was equally observed that the lagged value of GFCF had no significant impact on GFCF in the preceding year. Outcome of study did not come as a surprise, seeing that a functional classification of Nigeria’s expenditure profile for the period under review reveals that; outlays on <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> <b>accounted</b> for only about 32 % of total expenditures, while the remaining balance of 68 % went to recurrent expenditures. That is certainly not good enough for a nation that is aspiring to grow. No nation has ever treaded the path of growth with this burgeoning level of recurrent expenditures.

After three years of solid growth in 1990 – 92, the economy stagnated in 1993 – 94, as severe weather conditions sharply reduced banana harvests.

40|$|We {{investigate}} factors {{responsible for}} low public sector human capital investment in Pakistan. The {{debt servicing burden}} coupled with a rising debt stock can impact on human <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure.</b> To <b>account</b> for this, a Debt Net Cost Index is developed to measure the evolving net cost of public debt starting in 1960. Political factors examined are regime type, frequency of elections, quality of democracy, international aid preferences, elite capture in terms of industrial concentration, military burden and external hostility indices. We find that for the period as a whole from 1960 onwards, political factors dominate economic explanations such as the burden of debt servicing in accounting for low levels of human development expenditure. Only during episodes of civilian rule do economic factors {{in the form of}} the debt servicing burden become salient. This is because civilian governments are often saddled with inherited debt from earlier military rulers. Pakistan's military regimes have been less resource constrained because of greater external flows, allowing them to spend more on everything, but the rise in human development expenditures was less than proportional to the rise in available resources...|$|R

Summary This report extends the analysis presented in Health expenditure Australia 2012 - 13 to further explore expenditure on particular categories of health goods and services, including Hospitals, Primary health care, Other recurrent areas of health <b>expenditure</b> and <b>Capital</b> <b>expenditure.</b> In 2012 - 13, $ 55. 9 billion {{was spent on}} Hospitals in Australia, $ 52. 9 billion on Primary health care and $ 29. 9 billion on Other recurrent areas of health spending. <b>Capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> <b>accounted</b> for a further $ 8. 6 billion. All funders increased their expenditure on Hospitals between 2002 - 03 and 2012 - 13; however, growth in state and territory government funding, at $ 10. 6 billion (a 78. 6 % increase), was almost double the growth of Australian Government expenditure ($ 5. 4 billion or 37. 2 % growth). Non-government expenditure grew by $ 5. 6 billion (88. 6 %). Over the decade, total spending on Primary health care grew from $ 32. 7 billion to $ 52. 9 billion. Primary health care spending is shared relatively evenly between Australian Government (about 43 %) and non-government sources (about 41 %). In 2012 - 13, the Australian Government accounted for $ 17. 9 billion, or nearly 60 %, of the total recurrent expenditure in Other recurrent areas of health care. Individuals provided the next largest source of funds, with an expenditure of $ 5. 4 billion in 2012 - 13. In the past 5 years, from 2008 - 09 to 2012 - 13, the share of recurrent expenditure on Primary health care has increased slightly from 37. 1 % to 38. 1 %, whereas expenditure on Other recurrent areas has declined marginally from 22. 2 % to 21. 5 %. There has been no clear trend in the Hospitals proportion over this time, beginning at 40. 5 % in 2008 - 09 and ending at 40. 3 % in 2012 - 13. The ratio of Australian Government expenditure on health to tax revenue was 24. 8 % in 2012 - 13, down from 26. 9 % in 2011 - 12. The ratio of state and territory government expenditure to tax revenue rose from 17. 7 % in 2002 - 03 to 24. 5 % in 2012 - 13.

A Reexamination of the Incremental Information Content of <b>Capital</b> <b>Expenditures</b> Abstract: Under generally accepted accounting principles, firms must postpone recognition of the earnings effects of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> until they realize the resulting revenues and expenses. However, if <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> change the profile of future profits, we expect share prices to impound that revision in profitability prior to its recognition under GAAP. This suggests that changes in <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> should have information content beyond current-period unexpected earnings. Prior research considered annual changes in <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> and detected incremental information only in restricted samples. However, we examine more general samples and observe that quarterly as well as annual changes in <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> are informative beyond unexpected earnings. Furthermore, we predict greater incremental information content for fiscal fourth quarter changes in <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> when considering all fiscal quarters simultaneously, because the effect of the earnings recognition delay under GAAP should be magnified for <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> made late in the fiscal year. Our results are consistent with this prediction and inconsistent with the prediction that changes in fiscal fourth quarter <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> reflect lower profitability that result from an inefficient bunching of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> in the fiscal fourth quarter.

40|$|The {{ability of}} Commercial Real Estate to provide strong current income returns {{has long been}} one of its {{benefits}} of inclusion into a long-term portfolio. <b>Capital</b> <b>Expenditures</b> can significantly hamper this income return of commercial properties and mislead the investors into making misguided decisions. However, there {{has long been an}} informational vacuum about <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> and the current available literature can best be described as non-existent. This thesis focuses entirely on <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> to understand the future implications of <b>Capital</b> <b>Expenditure</b> Spending, and to understand the co-relation between different property characteristics and <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure.</b> The thesis uses contingency tables to understand the behavior of commercial properties over a span of nine years. The goal was to understand if <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> spends have an impact on future spends. If an investor invests high (low) <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> in the present do they keep spending high (low) all throughout their hold periods or their spending changes over time. Secondly, regression analyses is used to better understand the relationship between different property characteristics and <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> and this exercise helps build an intuition about <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> spends. The contingency tables and regression analyses revealed distinguishing trends about <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> and helped understand its behavior. It was revealed that investors currently spending high on <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> are not necessarily successful in saving <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> spends in the future. The regression analyses defined a positive correlation for <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> with respect to age, sq. ft, NOI and market value and it defined a negative co-relation with respect to cap rate and location considering the property was located in the top six markets in the country. by Mehul Chavada.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{contemporary}} issue of municipal finance. Municipalities in Czech Republic make up important part of public sector and influence the fiscal performance of Czech economy. Simultaneously, the <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> of municipalities has {{a crucial role in}} shaping of the entrepreneurial environment and of an environment in the widest sense. The goal of this paper was to analyse the <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> of municipalities in Czech Republic from the national economy point of view and to analyse the financing of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> between 1994 and 2003. The emphasis was given to the relation between the <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> and the indebtedness of municipalities. The analysis reveals that the <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> make significant share of overall public <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure,</b> the share exceeds 50 %. The <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> of municipalities also participate considerably on gross fixed capital formation (10. 57 % in 2003) and therefore on GDP formation (2. 83 % in 2003). However, considering the economic cycle, <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> of municipalities has pro-cyclical effect. Analysis the structure of financing of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure,</b> the operating surplus is very important resource. However, it is not sufficient one even considered together with capital incomes and capital subsidies. It results in using loans to finance the <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure.</b> This happened between 1994 and 2003, with the exclusions of 1998 and 1999. Because of the future high need of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure,</b> it can be expected that municipalities will employ even more loans. The link between <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> and indebtedness of municipalities can be identified. There is another factor in effect. The volume of operating (especially tax) incomes is not sufficient. The state decentralizes significant portion of activities without providing municipalities with corresponding income. Municipalities then are not able to generate adequate operating surplus to finance the deficit on capital budget. Consequently, the rate of growth of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> of municipalities declines as well as the share of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> on overall municipal expenditure...|$|R
