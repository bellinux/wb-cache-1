40|$|Over every 24 h diel cycle, CAM plants face a {{conflict}} between partitioning storage carbohydrate to growth and maintenance, {{and the provision of}} substrate for nocturnal CO 2 uptake. It has been proposed that a strict temporal coordination of growth processes, starch degradation and utilization might underpin physiological homeostasis of CAM plants by curtailing competition for carbon skeletons and ensuring a threshold potential for nocturnal CO 2 uptake. The circadian clock, comprising of the regulatory genes TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC 1), CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA 1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) as the core loop of the central oscillator, is assumed to be a key factor in regulating these processes. Here we investigated the role of the <b>clock</b> in <b>metering</b> out nocturnal starch breakdown as well as regulating the balance between carbon allocation for growth, versus supplying carbon skeletons to sustain nocturnal CO 2 fixation in CAM plants. We studied CO 2 uptake and carbohydrate turnover in both wild type and transgenic TOC 1 over-expressing lines of Kalanchoë fedtschenkoi. From a normal photoperiod (12 / 12 h) plants were shifted into a short day (8 / 16 h) and long day (16 / 8 h) treatment respectively. Gas exchange was monitored by IRGA and leaf samples were taken every 4 hours for the determination of organic acids, sugars and starch. The results show that a functioning clock is key to gear starch and organic acid metabolism to each other and as such ensures that sufficient carbon is available for growth. Moreover, an impaired clock restrains plants from adequately adapting their starch cycles under changing environments, with a reduced photosynthetic efficiency as a consequence. status: accepte...|$|R
5000|$|The chief {{advantage}} of the anchor was that by locating the pallets farther from the pivot, the swing of the pendulum was reduced from around 100° in verge clocks to only 4°-6°. [...] In addition to the improved accuracy due to isochronism, this allowed clocks to use longer pendulums, which had a slower 'beat'. Lower air drag meant they needed less power to keep swinging, and caused less wear on the clock's movement. The anchor also allowed {{the use of a}} heavier pendulum bob for a given drive force, making the pendulum more independent of the escapement (higher Q), and thus more accurate. These long pendulums required long narrow clock cases. Around 1680 British clockmaker William Clement began selling the first commercial clocks to use the anchor escapement, tall freestanding <b>clocks</b> with 1 <b>meter</b> (39 inch) seconds pendulums that came to be called longcase or 'grandfather' clocks. The anchor increased the accuracy of clocks so much that around 1680-1690 the use of the minute hand, formerly the exception in clocks, became the rule.|$|R

The cestus and scissor, wielded by Chuck Liddell, were tested on a 400-lb piece of beef. The cestus broke its ribs while the scissor almost cut it in half. Before the cestus test, Chuck Liddell's natural punching speed and power were measured: Liddell's punching speed was <b>clocked</b> at 14 <b>meters</b> per second—almost 50 percent faster than the average Olympic boxer—while his punching power was judged to deliver 1000 pounds of force—enough to break most facial bones on contact.
