5|$|By {{early spring}} of 1794, the {{situation}} in France was dire. With famine looming after {{the failure of the}} harvest and the blockade of French ports and trade, the French government was forced to look overseas for sustenance. Turning to France's colonies in the Americas, and the agricultural bounty of the United States, the National Convention gave orders for the formation of a large convoy of sailing vessels to gather at Hampton Roads in the Chesapeake Bay, where Admiral Vanstabel would wait for them. According to contemporary historian William James this <b>conglomeration</b> of ships was said to be over 350 strong, although he disputes this figure, citing the number as 117 (in addition to the French warships).|$|E

5|$|The basic {{arthropod}} {{central nervous}} system consists {{of a pair of}} nerve cords running below the gut, with paired ganglia as local control centers in all segments; a brain formed by fusion of the ganglia for the head segments ahead of and behind the mouth, so that the esophagus is encircled by this <b>conglomeration</b> of ganglia. Except for the primitive Mesothelae, of which the Liphistiidae are the sole surviving family, spiders have the much more centralized nervous system that is typical of arachnids: all the ganglia of all segments behind the esophagus are fused, so that the cephalothorax is largely filled with nervous tissue and there are no ganglia in the abdomen; in the Mesothelae, the ganglia of the abdomen and the rear part of the cephalothorax remain unfused.|$|E

The stone and brick buildings are densely packed below the church and castle, which are rendered in a descriptive perspective (i.e., their size relates to their social status, rather than their actual dimensions). Scattered wooden structures appear on the surrounding rural ridges, today part of central Stockholm. Though the phenomenon is said to have occurred in the morning, the city is depicted in the evening with shadows facing east.|$|E
5|$|The Huon Peninsula is {{situated}} along the north-east coast of Papua New Guinea, and stretches from Lae {{in the south}} on the Huon Gulf to Sio in the north along the Vitiaz Strait. Along the coast, between these two points, numerous rivers and streams cut the terrain. Of these, the most prominent are the Song, Bumi and Mape Rivers. These waterways flow from the mountainous interior which is formed through the <b>conglomeration</b> of the Rawlinson Range in the south, with the Cromwell Mountains in the east. These meet in {{the centre of the}} peninsula to form the Saruwaged Range massif, which joins the Finisterre Range further west. Apart from a thin, flat coastal strip, {{at the time of the}} campaign, the area was thickly covered with dense jungle, through which very few tracks had been cut. The terrain was rugged and for the most part the tracks, until improved by engineers, were largely impassable to motor transport and as a result throughout the campaign a large amount of the Allied resupply effort was undertaken on foot.|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} work, we {{developed}} a facile strategy for the crosslinked polymeric multi-lacuna nanocapsules (CP(St–OA) nanocapsules) about 40 nm with carboxylic groups on their inner and outer surfaces. The spindle-like α-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles were organo-modified with oleic acid (OA) and the oleic acid modified spindle-like α-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles (OA–Fe 2 O 3) formed the small <b>conglomerations</b> in water. Then the small <b>conglomerations</b> were used as the templates for the soapless microemulsion polymerization. The small <b>conglomerations</b> of OA–Fe 2 O 3 were encapsulated in the crosslinked polymer nanoparticles obtained. Then the crosslinked polymeric multi-lacuna nanocapsules (CP(St–OA) nanocapsules) with carboxylic groups on their inner and outer surfaces were achieved after the templates were etched with HCl in tetrahydrofuran (THF).|$|R
5|$|The ice {{crystals}} in cirrus clouds have different shapes {{in addition to}} different sizes. Some shapes include solid columns, hollow columns, plates, rosettes, and <b>conglomerations</b> of the various other types. The shape of the {{ice crystals}} {{is determined by the}} air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and ice supersaturation. Cirrus in temperate regions typically have the shapes segregated by type: the columns and plates tend to {{be at the top of}} the cloud, whereas the rosettes and <b>conglomerations</b> tend to be near the base. In the northern Arctic region, cirrus tend to be composed of only the columns, plates, and <b>conglomerations,</b> and these crystals tend to be at least four times larger than the minimum size. In Antarctica, cirrus are usually composed of only the columns, and these columns are much longer than normal.|$|R

5|$|There was {{considerable}} <b>conglomeration</b> in the US ice trade {{towards the end}} of the century, and foreign competitors, such as Norway, complained of US collusion. Charles W. Morse was a businessman from Maine who by 1890 had used questionable financial processes to acquire control of the New York City Ice Company and the Consumers' Ice Company of New York, merging them into the Consolidated Ice Company. In turn Morse bought out his major competitor the Knickerbocker Ice Company of New York in 1896, giving him control of around four million tons (four billion kg) of the regional ice harvests each year. Morse incorporated his few remaining rivals into the American Ice Company in 1899, giving him control of all of the natural and plant ice supplies and distribution in the north-east of the US. On the west coast, Edward Hopkins formed the Union Ice Company in San Francisco, bringing together a range of regional ice companies to produce another huge ice company. In contrast, the competition in the British market remained harsh, keeping prices relatively low.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the 13th {{century the}} Ottomans started uniting Anatolia and created an empire that {{encompassed}} much of Southeast Europe, West Asia and North Africa. The Ottoman Empire reached its peak land mass and became a world power during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent in the early modern period. It remained powerful and influential for two more centuries, until important setbacks in the 17th and 18th century forced it to cede strategic territories in Europe, which signaled the loss of its former military strength and wealth. After the 1913 Ottoman coup d'état, which effectively put the country {{under the control of the}} Three Pashas, the Ottoman Empire decided to join the Central Powers during World War I. The Central Powers were ultimately defeated by the Allied Powers, despite Turkish victories over them during the war. During the war, the Ottoman government committed genocides against its Armenian, Assyrian and Pontic Greek citizens. Following the war, the <b>conglomeration</b> of territories and peoples that formerly comprised the Ottoman Empire was partitioned into several new states. The Turkish War of Independence, initiated by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and his colleagues against occupying Allies, resulted in the abolition of monarchy in 1922 and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, with Atatürk as its first president. Atatürk enacted numerous reforms, many of which incorporated various aspects of western thought, philosophy, and customs into the new form of Turkish government.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Specific studies {{about the}} stable isotope {{composition}} (18 O/ 16 O and D/H) of atmospheric icy <b>conglomerations</b> are still scarce.
