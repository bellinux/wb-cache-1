5000|$|In the UK {{the term}} [...] "department store" [...] still {{refers to the}} traditional, <b>classic</b> <b>department</b> store, which has {{a wide range of}} {{independent}} departments with their own staff and their own tills. Large discount stores with the tills located by the entrance are not regarded as department stores in the UK, although the owners may call them that. Such stores as Marks & Spencer, Britain's largest clothes retailer would therefore not be included in the British definition of a department store.|$|E
50|$|Kensington High Street is one {{of western}} London's most popular {{shopping}} streets, with upmarket shops serving a wealthy area. From the late 19th century until the mid-1970s the street had three <b>classic</b> <b>department</b> stores: Barkers of Kensington, Derry & Toms and Pontings. Barkers bought Pontings in 1906 and Derry & Toms in 1920, but continued to run all three as separate entities. In a big building project which started in 1930 and was not complete until 1958 (the Second World War halted the project), the company made Derry & Toms and Barkers into Art Deco palaces. On top of Derry & Toms, Europe's largest roof garden area (1.5 acre) was created, consisting of three different gardens with 500 species of plants, fountains, a stream, duck, flamingos and a restaurant - said to serve the best high tea in Kensington.|$|E

5000|$|The M.L. Parker {{building}} was constructed {{on the northwest}} corner of Brady and West Second Street in 1922.

5000|$|Several notable personalities {{have owned}} 507s. In 1959, while {{stationed}} in Germany on duty with the US Army and as noted above, legendary American entertainer Elvis Presley bought two models. Presley's first 507, no. 70079 and colored white, had earlier {{been used as}} a press demonstrator by BMW and raced by Hans Stuck. Because many of Presley's fans left lipstick marks on the car, mainly while parked outside his home at 14 Goethestrasse, in Bad Nauheim, he had it painted red. It was imported into the United States in 1960 and was bought by Alabama disc jockey Tommy Charles, who had it extensively modified, including having the engine replaced with a Chevrolet V8. In July 2014, BMW Group announced that Presley's car, would be on display for a short period at the BMW Museum in Munich, before being entirely restored by its <b>Classic</b> <b>department.</b> This fully restored car, now back to its original white color, is currently on display in the newly renovated BMW Zentrum museum located at their US manufacturing center in Greer, SC. Presley reportedly gave his second 507, no. 70192, to Ursula Andress, who starred in Fun in Acapulco with him in 1963. Andress's husband, John Derek, who had yet another 507 but had just sold it to entertainer Fred Astaire, then had the 507 Elvis gave his wife especially customized, which included changing its color from white to light blue, as well as having the engine replaced with a Ford 289 V8. Andress sold the car in 1997 to George Barris for US$300,000. The car was then again restored with a correct drivetrain by a later owner. When the car arrived at McDougall's Carrera Automotive it had also been repainted black. Being that the original engine was lost to time 2 503 V8's were located along with the dual carburetor intake from a 507. Both engines were made into a running engine with BMW AG making a new engine gasket kit including head gaskets at a cost of [...] It was also returned to its original white color and subsequentyly sold at auction for [...] and at another auction in 2011 for [...]|$|E
