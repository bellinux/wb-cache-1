25|$|Rumors {{circulated}} {{in the villages}} warning the rural residents that collectivization would bring disorder, hunger, famine, {{and the destruction of}} crops and livestock. Readings and reinterpretations of Soviet newspapers labeled collectivization as a second serfdom. Villagers were afraid the old landowners/serf owners were <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> that the villagers joining the collective farm would face starvation and famine. More reason for peasants to believe collectivization was a second serfdom was that entry into the kolkhoz had been forced. Farmers did {{not have the right to}} leave the collective without permission. The level of state procurements and prices on crops also enforced the serfdom analogy. The government would take a majority of the crops and pay extremely low prices. The serfs during the 1860s were paid nothing but collectivization still reminded the peasants of serfdom. To them, this “second serfdom” became code for the Communist betrayal of the revolution. To the peasants, the revolution was about giving more freedom and land to the peasants, but instead they had to give up their land and livestock to the collective farm.|$|E

500|$|Chris Robinson and Robb Buono, the film's {{production}} designer, {{decided that}} the script was composed of two distinct parts— {{the reality of the}} teens' lives and the time they spent at the skating rink. According to Buono, [...] "we wanted to look at it [...] through rose colored glasses, because when you think back on your memories of that time period— no matter what age you are— you see everything bigger. Our goal was to make that roller skating rink a character that grows as we keep <b>coming</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> each time it’s more magical— a Saturday Night Fever-like contrast to the reality of life.” Robinson and Buono chose to shoot at the Cascade Family Skating Rink in Atlanta after visiting and witnessing the energy and excitement of the rink. However, the filmmakers felt Cascade's interior design was too bland and decided it should be redesigned.|$|E

Alba was hired for the role before the scripts were written. Eglee said [...] "We had the benefit of being able to write a script kind of backwards, we were writing for this actress, with her cadences and her rhythms and her sensibilities and her attitude and her slang."

500|$|They {{followed}} {{this in the}} fourth round with a 2–0 victory over Liverpool at Anfield. The match was played seven days {{after the death of}} King George V, with both teams wearing black armbands. The crowd of 60,000 stood to sing Abide with Me and God Save the King before the kickoff. In the fifth round they were drawn against Newcastle United, in a rematch of the 1932 final. Newcastle had already knocked out the current cup holders, Sheffield Wednesday, in an earlier round. On the day, the gates to St James' Park needed to be closed before the match started to keep additional spectators out, some 64,484 fans already being inside the ground. The match resulted in a 3-3 draw, Arsenal having gone a goal ahead each time, but Newcastle <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> equalizing. The reason being according to the report in The Times was because [...] "Whenever the lead was gained, the side concentrated entirely on defense." [...] In the replay at home, Arsenal won the game 3–0. They had gone a goal up in the first half from a penalty scored by Bastin after the Newcastle centre half David Davidson handled the ball in the box. Newcastle were unlucky not to draw level, and only Eddie Hapgood clearing a shot off the line prevented the scoreline being equal once more. The second goal came during an advance by Arsenal, where the Newcastle goalkeeper, Norman Tapken, cleared the ball directly to Arsenal midfielder Pat Beasley, who shot the ball into the back of an empty net. The final goal was another penalty, caused when Bastin was brought down in the box, who then promptly took and scored the shot himself.|$|E
