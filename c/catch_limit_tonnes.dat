They are limited to harvesting a few hundred tonnes of krill per year, and Nicol & Foster consider it unlikely that any new large-scale harvesting operations in these areas will be started due to the opposition from local fishing industries and conservation groups.|$|R

50|$|Pungently flavoured, coarse, and {{slightly}} oily flesh makes Australian salmon less desirable {{as a food}} fish; it is often sold canned or is smoked to improve its flavour, and bleeding the fish out is also said to help. What is not sold for human consumption is used as bait for rock lobster (Palinuridae) traps and other commercial and recreational fishing. The Australian salmon fetch {{no more than a}} few dollars (AU) per kilogram; nonetheless, large numbers are taken via purse seine nets (and to a lesser extent trawling, hauling, gill, and trap nets) annually; the reported 2002-2003 commercial New Zealand catch of kahawai was 2,900 tonnes. Such reported catches do not include the untold tonnes taken as bycatch from operations targeting more highly valued species. Low-flying planes are used to locate and target sizeable Australian salmon schools, and critics have cited this practice as a means by the industry to artificially inflate catch records (which would give a false impression of abundance). Australian salmon numbers have declined noticeably however, with large specimens becoming ever rarer; the fish have all but disappeared from some areas. On October 1, 2004, the New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries included kahawai under its Quota Management System, setting a <b>catch</b> <b>limit</b> of 3,035 <b>tonnes</b> for the season.

40|$|The New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) manages New England’s {{northeast}} multispecies fishery {{with effort}} controls including gear restrictions, seasonal and permanent closures, trip and daily possession limits, and days-at-sea (DAS). The fishery operates on a soft or “target” {{total allowable catch}} (TAC) rather than a hard <b>catch</b> <b>limit.</b> Target TACs lack a closure provision, and do not require overages to be deducted from the following year’s recommended TAC. New England routinely exceeds target catch levels for multiple stocks, threatening rebuilding objectives and leading to more restrictive effort controls. Hard <b>catch</b> <b>limits</b> would provide greater control over total fishing mortality, ensuring that managers and fishermen are held accountable to objectives of the multispecies management plan and that rebuilding plans are successful. They would also eliminate the economic inefficiencies generated by input controls and provide fishermen with greater economic opportunities during the rebuilding process. Seven sub-programs within the northeast multispecies fishery are currently managed under hard <b>catch</b> <b>limits</b> including the Georges Bank hook and fixed gear sectors, the U.

40|$|Following an {{assessment}} of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in the Scotia Sea, CCAMLR established a precautionary <b>catch</b> <b>limit</b> of 4 million tonnes and further adopted 15 small-scale management units (SSMUs). The intent was to subdivide the precautionary <b>catch</b> <b>limit</b> for krill among the SSMUs so as to preclude the inadvertent concentration of catches in {{a small portion of}} the surveyed area. Five options for allocating the <b>catch</b> <b>limit</b> among the SSMUs in the Scotia Sea are presented in this paper. The first four are static allocations where the allotment of catch to an SSMU is proportional to: (i) the historical catch within the SSMU; (ii) estimated predator demand in the SSMU; (iii) estimated standing stock of krill in the SSMU; and (iv) standing stock less predator demand in the SSMU. The fifth option is a dynamic allocation based on land-based predator monitoring conducted just prior to, or early in, the fishing season. For the purposes of illustration and comparison between the options, parameter estimates are made using available data, although it is recognised that considerable refinement of these estimates is possible. Qualitative conclusions are that: under the first two options a substantial portion (> 65 %) of the <b>catch</b> <b>limit</b> would be allocated to three or less of the SSMUs adjacent to large concentrations of land-breeding predators; under options (iii) and (iv) a similar portion of the <b>catch</b> <b>limit</b> would be directed to pelagic SSMUs beyond the foraging range of these predators but into areas where krill fishing has not regularly occurred; and under option (v), an example of an adjustable <b>catch</b> <b>limit</b> dependent on the results of ecosystem monitoring, the fishery would be restricted in some of its traditional fishing grounds during years of low krill availability. Under all five options there would be little effect on the existing fishery However, as catches increase, a trade-off may be drawn between options that displace the fishery from its current operating area, but reduce the potential for contravening the terms of the Convention, and options that do not displace the fishery, but are likely to contravene the terms of the CCAMLR Convention...|$|R
