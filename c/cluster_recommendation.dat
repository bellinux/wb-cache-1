40|$|Abstract — Mobile Ad hoc network (MANET) {{consists}} {{of a set of}} mobile nodes in an inherently insecure environment, having limited battery capacities. Since MANET do not have a fix infrastructure, wireless links are vulnerable and topology changes randomly, securing MANET is difficult than the traditional networks. In ad-hoc network mobile nodes comes and leaves the network so providing trust in such a network is crucial task. In this paper we survey different properties of trust like context dependency, asymmetricity, transitivity, etc. and cluster based and maturity based trust schemes are presented. A cluster based trust evaluation schemes for MANET is presented to overcome the limited information about unacquainted nodes and to lessen the memory space. The proposed cluster-based trust model can quickly obtain the trust value even in the situation where there has been no experience data available. In this scheme the concept of inter <b>cluster</b> <b>recommendation</b> trust was introduced. The trust value was calculated using the reputation from a neighbouring node. In this model, a network was divided into clusters with one special node (cluster head) responsible for establishing trust relationship for internal clusters dynamically based on previous transactions result. The head node issues the certificate showing the trust level of each member node. When a node moves from one cluster to another, its trust level is determined by the certificate issued by previous cluster-head. This model can monitor the selfish behaviour of nodes in the network and isolate the selfish nodes from the network to enhance the effectiveness throughout the network. In maturity based scheme, trust is based on previous individual experiences and on the recommendations of others. Recommendation Exchange Protocol (REP) is used that allows nodes to exchange recommendations about their neighbors. This model does not require distribution of the trust information over the entire network...|$|E

30|$|The {{number of}} {{iterations}} {{is determined by}} how many times it will run until the algorithm convergence. Another implementation of K-means is Apache Mahout [20] which {{is used as a}} machine learning software that allows applications to analyze a large set of data. Mahout uses Apache Hadoop power to solve a complex problem by breaking them up into multi-parallel tasks. Mahout offers three machine learning techniques which are <b>Recommendation,</b> Classification, and <b>Clustering.</b> <b>Recommendations</b> use user’s information with community information to determine the likelihood of user’s preference. For example, Netflix uses the Mahout Recommendation engine to suggest movies. Classification engine is used for example in classifying spam emails. It uses known data to determine how new data should be classified into a set of existing categories. So every time a user mark an email as ‘spam’ it directly influences the email Classification engine for providing future email spams. The last Mahout engine is clustering which is used for example to group different news of similar article together. This is mainly used by Google and other search engines. Clustering forms a group of similar data based on common characteristics. Unlike classifications, clustering does not group data into an existing set of known categories. This is particularly useful when the user is not sure how to organize the data in the first place.|$|R
40|$|In online Recommender Systems, {{people tend}} to consume and rate items that are not {{necessarily}} similar to one another. This phenomenon is {{a direct consequence of}} the fact that human taste is influenced by many factors that cannot be captured by pure Content-based or Collaborative Filtering approaches. For this reason, a desirable property of Recommender Systems would be to identify correlations between seemingly different items that might be of interest to a particular user. This course of action is expected to improve the novelty and the diversity of the recommendations and therefore increase user satisfaction. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a socially-aware personalized item <b>clustering</b> <b>recommendation</b> algorithm. We are trying to locate patterns between the items that a user has evaluated by grouping them into different clusters according to the rating behavior of the members of his Personal Network, which includes the individuals in his direct social network and those other persons that the user exhibits a similar item evaluation behavior. Once the clustering phase has been completed, we use each cluster’s members as seed items in order to construct an item consumption network. Then, by performing a random walk on the aforementioned network, we are able to produce recommendations that are accurate {{and at the same time}} novel and diverse. Preliminary results reveal the potential of this idea...|$|R
40|$|Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) aims to factorize {{a matrix}} into two {{optimized}} nonnegative matrices {{and has been}} widely used for unsupervised learning tasks such as product recommendation based on a rating matrix. However, although networks between nodes with the same nature exist, standard NMF overlooks them, e. g., the social network between users. This problem leads to comparatively low recommendation accuracy because these networks are also reflections {{of the nature of}} the nodes, such as the preferences of users in a social network. Also, social networks, as complex networks, have many different structures. Each structure is a composition of links between nodes and reflects the nature of nodes, so retaining the different network structures will lead to differences in recommendation performance. To investigate the impact of these network structures on the factorization, this paper proposes four multi-level network factorization algorithms based on the standard NMF, which integrates the vertical network (e. g., rating matrix) with the structures of horizontal network (e. g., user social network). These algorithms are carefully designed with corresponding convergence proofs to retain four desired network structures. Experiments on synthetic data show that the proposed algorithms are able to preserve the desired network structures as designed. Experiments on real-world data show that considering the horizontal networks improves the accuracy of document <b>clustering</b> and <b>recommendation</b> with standard NMF, and various structures show their differences in performance on these two tasks. These results can be directly used in document <b>clustering</b> and <b>recommendation</b> systems...|$|R

30|$|The SOM, {{which was}} first {{proposed}} by Kohonen, {{is one of}} the best known unsupervised artificial neural network models [9, 10]. The SOM is a competitive learning algorithm, which looks for similar patterns, features, and relations among samples. The SOM can be used for data classification or clustering. After clustering using the SOM algorithm, an arbitrary dimensional input vector can be mapped to a lower discrete grid (usually one- or two-dimensional (2 D)). The SOM retains most of the distance relations which were present in the original data in this lower discrete grid. There is a large body of research on the SOM. Some studies focus on improved algorithms for faster convergence, such as the fast SOM method proposed by Su and Chang [11], who added the k-means algorithm to obtain an initial clustering, which was used to speed up the convergence of the SOM learning. In Su et al. [12], it was proposed to use grid partitions to replace k-means. A hierarchical self-organizing map (HSOM) [13] uses a multi-layer architecture that splits the original single layer neuron network into multiple layers. After the upper layer, parent neurons are trained, their child neurons are trained, etc. Due to the superior clustering performance of the SOM on high-dimensional data, it has been employed for music data <b>clustering,</b> <b>recommendation,</b> and querying. The SOM-enhanced JukeBox, proposed by Rauber et al. [8] automatically creates an organization of music archives based on audio similarity. In Dickerson [14], the SOM was used to describe the properties of music and created a query-by-content system that operates independent of the user's query style.|$|R

Meanwhile, more and more document data come up with rich human-provided tag information during {{the evolution of the}} Internet, which called semistructured data. The semi-structured data contain both unstructured data (e. g., plain text) and metadata, such as papers with authors and web pages with tags. In general, different tags in a document play different roles with their own weights. To model such semi-structured documents is nontrivial. In this paper, we propose a novel method to model tagged documents by a topic model, called Tag-Weighted Topic Model (TWTM). TWTM is a framework that leverages the tags in each document to infer the topic components for the documents. This allows not only to learn document-topic distributions, but also to infer the tag-topic distributions for text mining (e. g., classification, <b>clustering,</b> and <b>recommendations).</b> Moreover, TWTM automatically infers the probabilistic weights of tags for each document.
