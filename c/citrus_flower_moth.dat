In particular, the Panel was asked whether these organisms {{can be considered as}} harmful organisms for the endangered area of the above departments, in the meaning of the definition mentioned in Article 2. 1. (e) of Directive 2000 / 29 /EC and thus potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC.

This document presents the opinion of the Panel on Plant Health on the full[1] pest risk assessment conducted by France on Prays citri with French Guiana, Guadeloupe and Martinique considered as endangered area. P. citri Millière (Insecta: Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae), the <b>citrus</b> <b>flower</b> <b>moth,</b> is usually found on Citrus. In addition, it has been reported to attack other Rutaceae and species of Sapotaceae (Manilkara zapota, Casimiroa edulis) and Oleaceae (Ligustrum lucidum). Damage may vary depending on the citrus crop attacked. Its major host is Citrus aurantiifolia (lime), but important damage can be inflicted also to Citrus limon (lemon) and occasionally to other citrus fruits, including sweet orange (Citrus sinensis). The larva feeds both internally and externally on flowers, flower buds and fruits; it will occasionally also feed on leaves and young shoots. The Panel examined in detail the risk assessment provided, and considered the accuracy and quality of the information provided and methods applied for pest risk assessment purposes. The review was based on the principles of the International Standard on Phytosanitary Measures ISPM No. 11 [2]: Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and living modified organisms (2004) by the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO, 2007 b). Many statements in the French document are not referenced or supported by verifiable scientific data. The ratings for the probability of entry, establishment and impact given in the pest risk assessment are difficult to interpret, {{due to the lack of}} evidence presented and inconsistent judgments by the assessors. This particularly applies to: the possible introduction pathways, available strategies to control the pest, and the potential economic impact of the pest in the PRA area[3]. Based upon information provided in the pest risk assessment and the relevant literature on the current distribution of the pest and the relative importance of pathways, the Panel judges the probability of entry to be low for fruits but moderate for plants for planting (including potted ornamental plants). The Panel disagrees with the document that the probability of establishment is moderate and considers it to be high, based on the presence of suitable host plants and the climatic adaptability of the pest. The information provided in the pest risk assessment for the economic impact assessment is limited and conflicting, and does not allow a reliable evaluation of the ratings given within this section. A review of the literature by the Panel suggests that the economic importance of this pest varies considerably, depending on the citrus species, cultivars and geographic area. The organism appears to cause economic damage particularly in lemon and lime crops with extended flowering or multiple bloom periods, where flowering may coincide with population peaks of adults. In some areas, repeated control measures may be required to prevent economic damage, whereas in other areas, no control measures are considered necessary. The French document, however, does not provide any information on cultivars of lemon and lime (Tahiti and Mexican lime) grown in the PRA area or on the number of crops produced per year, which makes an accurate judgement by the Panel on the potential economic impacts in lemon and lime difficult. Further information obtained by the Panel suggests that although limited in area, lime represents around 50 % of the citrus area under production in French Guiana and Guadeloupe. In addition, sweet orange represents 82 % of citrus production in Martinique, and damage has also been recorded for that crop, albeit to a lesser extent than for lemon and lime. The conclusion of the French document on Prays citri is that the species qualifies as a quarantine pest for French Guiana, Guadeloupe and Martinique. The Panel agrees that the organism may enter and can establish in the PRA area, and considers that the economic impact of P. citri in the PRA area is highly uncertain, and may range from low to high. Because of the high level of uncertainty, further research is recommended to estimate the direct pest effects on crop yield and quality, and the availability and feasibility of control options under the specific conditions of the PRA area. The Panel, therefore, concludes that P. citri is appropriate for evaluation of pest risk management options for the French overseas departments of French Guiana, Guadeloupe and Martinique, and isthus potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /E...|$|E
