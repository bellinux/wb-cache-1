Information collected during drought and pluvial periods indicates that adult hippo cows react to adverse environmental conditions (reduced shelter in pools, overcrowding and food scarcity) by marked declines in conception rates (from 36, 7 @ 5, 6). Indirect evidence indicates that when environmental conditions are unfavourable calf survival is improved by extending the period of lactation and by calves suckling more than one cow. During favourable years some calves mature early (S S, 2 years, and 9 9 5 years) but generally sexual maturity is attained at six and 9 - 10 years for males and females respectively. The calving interval, when environmental conditions are favourable, is about two years and reproductive senescence and sterility are insignificant factors. The population sex ratio is 1 : 1.

40|$|Effects of {{continental}} shelf bends, converging depth contours and changing depth profiles are discussed. Some analysis {{is carried out}} for previously unstudied cases. Separate oceanic interior and shelf flow problems are formulated for a sufficiently narrow shelf. The ocean interior ‘sees’ only an integrated shelf effect, typically increasing shelf-edge amplitudes, retarding longshore Kelvin-wave propagation and increasing natural mode periods by 0 (10 %). On the local shelf, the flow matches to the ocean interior and is nondivergent. Effects on shelf waves and slope currents depend subtly {{on the nature of}} the longshore variations. Curvature and contour convergence do not per se imply scaterring or generation of shelf waves. Indeed, any depth h(ξ) where ▽ 2 ξ(x,y) = 0 (a condition approximating longshelf uniformity in the topography's convexity) supports essentially the same shelf waves as do straight depth contours (DAVIS, 1983), and slope currents follow depth contours. Scattering results rather from breaks in analyticity of the depth profile. Hence calculations for small isolated features (necessarily highly convex or concave) may overestimate scattering, and superposition for realistic topography may lead to much self-cancellation among scattered waves. Otherwise, examples show a strong preference for scattering into adjacent mode numbers and into any shelf wave mode near to its maximum frequency. A shelf sector, where the maximum shelf wave frequency maxω is less than the frequency ω of an incident shelf wave, causes substantial scattering unless maxω and ω are very <b>close.</b> <b>Adjustment</b> of slope currents to changed conditions takes place through (and over the decay distance of) scattered shelf waves...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{research into}} effective voice biometrics (speaker recognition) under mismatched noise conditions. Over {{the last two}} decades, this class of biometrics {{has been the subject}} of considerable research due to its various applications in such areas as telephone banking, remote access control and surveillance. One of the main challenges associated with the deployment of voice biometrics in practice is that of undesired variations in speech characteristics caused by environmental noise. Such variations can in turn lead to a mismatch between the corresponding test and reference material from the same speaker. This is found to adversely affect the performance of speaker recognition in terms of accuracy. To address the above problem, a novel approach is introduced and investigated. The proposed method is based on minimising the noise mismatch between reference speaker models and the given test utterance, and involves a new form of Test-Normalisation (T-Norm) for further enhancing matching scores under the aforementioned adverse operating conditions. Through experimental investigations, based on the two main classes of speaker recognition (i. e. verification/ open-set identification), it is shown that the proposed approach can significantly improve the performance accuracy under mismatched noise conditions. In order to further improve the recognition accuracy in severe mismatch conditions, an approach to enhancing the above stated method is proposed. This, which involves providing a <b>closer</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the reference speaker models to the noise condition in the test utterance, is shown to considerably increase the accuracy in extreme cases of noisy test data. Moreover, to tackle the computational burden associated with the use of the enhanced approach with open-set identification, an efficient algorithm for its realisation in this context is introduced and evaluated. The thesis presents a detailed description of the research undertaken, describes the experimental investigations and provides a thorough analysis of the outcomes.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that bicycle training may improve the relationship between the global SEMG energy and VO 2. We already showed <b>close</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the root mean square (RMS) of the surface electromyogram (SEMG) to the oxygen uptake (VO 2) during cycling exercise in untrained subjects. Because in these circumstances an altered neuromuscular transmission which could affect SEMG measurement occurred in untrained individuals only, we searched for differences in the SEMG vs. VO 2 relationship between untrained subjects and well-trained cyclists. Each subject first performed an incremental exercise to determine VO 2 max and the ventilatory threshold, and second a constant-load threshold cycling exercise, continued until exhaustion. SEMG from both vastus lateralis muscles was continuously recorded. RMS was computed. M-Wave was periodically recorded. During incremental exercise: (1) a significant non-linear positive correlation was found between RMS increase and VO 2 increase in untrained subjects, whereas the relationship was best fitted by a straight line in trained cyclists; (2) the RMS/VO 2 ratio decreased progressively throughout the incremental exercise, its decline being significantly and markedly accentuated in trained cyclists; (3) in untrained subjects, significant M-wave alterations occurred at the end of the trial. These M-wave alterations could explain the non-linear RMS increase in these individuals. During constant-load exercise: (1) after an initial increase, the VO 2 ratio decreased progressively to reach a plateau after 2 min of exercise, but no significant inter-group differences were noted; (2) no M-wave changes were measured in the two groups. We concluded that the global SEMG energy recorded from the vastus lateralis muscle is a good estimate of metabolic energy expenditure during incremental cycling exercise only in well-trained cyclists...|$|R

40|$|According to Doctor J. E. Weaver and Mr. W. W.

They maintain that the native prairie vegetation is an organic entity in <b>close</b> <b>adjustment</b> with soil and climate, which has developed gradually to its present condition of dynamic stabilization. When the prairie is grazed and trampled, various changes occur, {{the nature and extent of}} which vary somewhat directly with the degree of disturbance, but under protection or deferred grazing, repair of moderate damage normally occurs rapidly. Once degeneration of the prairie is well under way, however, it proceeds so gradually and effectively that it is usually not observed until great loss in productivity is sustained, and several years are required for recovery. The stages in degeneration, how and why they occur, the types of pasture that are produced, and causes of complete disintegration are fully outlined and illustrated in this bulletin, which states that a knowledge of the stages of prairie degeneration affords a scientific basis for planned range improvement and pasture management. Doctor Weaver is eminently fitted by long study of grasslands in the midwestern and far western states to understand and analyze the problems of grazing native pastures. His scientific training is tempered by an unusual interest in the application of scientific facts to practical problems of crop production. He knows that native forage produced in pastures is an important crop largely within the control of man, a fact greatly emphasized by the recent drought. This crop may be decreased or increased next year and the next, depending much upon the present treatment of the range.

Their life situation necessitates a support from relatives or municipal eldercare staff {{in order for them to}} continue to participate in everyday living. In addition, the architectural space requires a <b>close</b> <b>adjustment</b> to the personal panorama of cognitive or functional impairments. The habitat can be a flat appropriated many years previously or in a residential care home for dependent and frail seniors. Architecture for ageing with dependency demonstrates how space can be used either to affirm or oppress the older person’s attempts to maintain an independent life style. By use of design theory, case study methodology and a heterogeneous research strategy, this study uses a threefold approach—a retrospective, a contemporaneous, and a future-oriented approach—to explore frail older people’s interaction with the architectural space of residential care homes. This has resulted in seven papers that focus on aspects of these human interactions with the built environment. Based on twelve exemplary models, the research paper I concludes that national guidelines result in a homelike, a hotel-like or a hospital-like environment. Research paper II is a retrospective study that examines the use of architecture competitions as a socio-political instrument to define architectural guidelines. Research paper III focuses on dependent seniors’ spatial appropriation of the communally shared space of a ward in a residential care home. Research paper IV employs two environmental assessment methods from the architecture profession and gerontological research (TESS-NH) in order to evaluate the use of interior colouring when refurbishing two residential care homes while the residents remained in place. Research paper V displays a municipal organizer’s considerations to opt for an architecture competition as a means of renewing architecture for the ageing population. Research paper VI examines competition documentation of three municipal architecture competitions organized during the period of 2006 to 2009. Research paper VII, the final study, explores notions concerning the appropriate space for ageing found among a group of municipal representatives, and people from organizations defending older people’s right. It supplies a model for understanding the appropriate space for ageing. This study illustrates the absence of older people with frailties in the public discussion about appropriate architecture for ageing. During the 20 th century, the multi-dimensional idea of an architectural space with a homelike appearance has been used to contrast the negatively charged opposite—the complete and austere institution. The overarching conclusion of this study is that architecture for dependent and frail seniors constitutes a particular type of built space that requires an extended dialogue involving dependent seniors, architects, building contractors and care planners in order to conceive appropriate architecture for the ageing society.

Observation equation (A-matrix) and condition equation (B-matrix) were applied in the adjustment, a weight matrix was also assigned in the adjustment. Geopotential differences were computed based on the Helmert orthometric height at point 580, then geopotenial numbers of the other points were computed by adding the geopotential number with the adjusted potential differences, then height systems could be determined as well as height corrections. In the <b>closed</b> loop <b>adjustment</b> especially adjustment of several loops with many data, condition equation adjustment is preferred because of the smaller size of design matrix compared to the observation equations and the advantage of condition equations over observation equations is that loop misclosures can be determined by condition equation.

The difference of the geopotential numbers between unweighted and weighted adjustment is up to 0. 0129 m 2 /s 2 and the difference of height systems between unweighted and weighted adjustment is up to 0. 0013 meter or 1. 3 millimeter, so the height system computations were not significantly affected by the assigned weight. The difference of height corrections between unweighted and weighted adjustment is up to 10 - 8 m so the assigned weights did not affect height correction results. Normal corrections give the smallest values while dynamic corrections give the largest values because the test area is located at latitude 48. 485 ° instead of latitude 45 ° so the correction values are quite large...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} revenue {{management}} research efforts {{has historically been}} {{on the development of}} seat optimizers which find revenue maximizing booking limits by fare class in a nested fare class structure. Significantly less attention has been devoted to the input methodologies which provide information to the seat optimization algorithm, which is then used to calculate booking limits. Among these inputs are a forecasting method and detruncation method. The forecaster provides the seat optimizer with estimated mean unconstrained bookings and standard deviation by fare class for a forecast flight. The detruncator adjusts data from historical flights used by the forecaster which have constrained booking information because they have reached booking limits. A third optional input methodology is an adjustment within the seat inventory control process (either to booking data or booking limits provided by the seat optimization algorithm) to account for the possibility of passenger sell-up to a higher fare class when the initially-desired class has been <b>closed.</b> This <b>adjustment</b> has the effect of inducing more sell-up. Using PODS (a comprehensive simulator of passenger behavior and seat inventory control in a fully competitive framework), this thesis compares pickup, regression, and "efficient" forecasting on a revenue basis. Similar comparisons are performed for no detruncation, booking curve detruncation with and without scaling, projection detruncation, and pickup detruncation. Finally, a modified booking limit strategy to induce sell-up introduced by Belobaba and Weatherford is tested. All tests are performed under a variety of environmental conditions. Forecasting results indicate that the efficient forecaster is nearly always revenue inferior to pickup forecasting. Neither regression nor pickup forecasting were unambiguously superior: The relative performance of these two forecasters is dependent on detruncation method choice and environmental conditions. Among detruncation methods, not detruncating or pickup detruncation is inferior. Scaling the booking curve used for detruncation yielded superior revenue results over not scaling, and projection detruncation always performed at least as well as booking curve detruncation without scaling. Sell-up tests indicate significant revenue gains to estimating sell-up probabilities. Revenue gains are limited if competitors cannot collude, many alternative flights exist, or passengers have low willingness to pay for higher-valued fare classes.

40|$|Introduction. A {{large number}} of {{studies have shown that the}} quality of marital {{adjustment}} is related to the adult attachment styles. Moreover other studies have shown that the quality of marital adjustment is also related to the individual differences in handling conflicts. Attachment theory provides a framework to understand different ways to face to the emerging conflicts as well as to increase our knowledge on marital adjustment. Aim. Goals of the current pilot study are: 1) testing the role of individual ability in handling conflicts; 2) evaluating the influence of the adult attachment styles on the quality of marital adjustment. Method. We administered Experience in <b>Close</b> Relationship-Revised, Dyadic <b>Adjustment</b> Scale, and Interpersonal Competence Questionnaire-Revised to 32 married or cohabitant subjects. Results. A multiple regression model was performed. Preliminary results show that avoidant style and the conflict management subscale significantly influence the dyadic cohesion subscale (F(2, 29) = 10. 696; p< 0, 001). Indeed, lower scores of avoidance and higher scores in the ability to handle conflicts positively influence the dialogue and the dyadic abilities to share activities and interest within the couple. However the adult attachment style and the ability to manage conflicts did not influence the total marital adjustment. Conclusion. Avoidant attachment style works as a significant predictor of difficulties in dyadic cohesion, while interpersonal competences in handling conflicts is a predictor of a good-enough dyadic cohesion. Lastly data shows that individual differences in attachment style and conflict management do not influence the overall couple adjustment...|$|R
40|$|Tufted ducks {{were trained}} to dive to and from a respirometer box on a 1. 7 m dive tank, so that {{measurements}} of respiratory gas exchange could be measured, along with time budget data. These data were combined with power cost estimates of diving {{to show that the}} optimal breathing model quantitatively predicted surface duration and the oxygen metabolised during foraging for the mean of all subject ducks but not for individual birds. Respirometry data also showed that both the oxygen and carbon dioxide stores were <b>close</b> to full <b>adjustment</b> after mean surface duration suggesting they have a similar influence on surface duration in tufted ducks, while pre-dive hyperventilation caused hypocapnia suggesting carbon dioxide is more often a limiting factor on dive duration. Oxygen uptake was not affected by hypercapnic exposure between dives and minimally affected by hypoxia, however dive time budgeting changed in both cases. This confirmed an influence of carbon dioxide on diving behaviour while estimates of respiratory exchange ratios above one during dives from hypoxia suggested the employment of anaerobic metabolic pathways in hypoxic conditions. Allometric studies investigating relationships between body mass and diving parameters across and within taxonomic groups of divers highlighted a number of limitations in our current knowledge of diving animals and also questioned some of the mass associated correlations that have been widely considered to exist across diving species.

40|$|Integration of {{airborne}} laser scanning (ALS) point clouds and aerial images {{has a great}} potential for accurate and robust 3 D modeling and recognition of objects in our environment. The integration requires, however, an accurate registration of data sources, which cannot be yet achieved by direct georeferencing using both the GPS and IMU. This research paper presents a method for registering aerial images with ALS data and for evaluating the accuracy of existing registration. An aerial image is included into a multi-scale image block, in which relative orientations of terrestrial close range images and aerial images are then known from the bundle block <b>adjustment.</b> <b>Close</b> range images provide more detailed view of possible tie features and also a new perspective compared to aerial images. For the actual registration of ALS data and image block, one or more images of the block can be chosen. Selected images can include only close range images or both close range images and aerial images. For the registration, the interactive orientation method was used. When selected images are registered with ALS data, the exterior orientations of all other images of the block can be calculated from the known relative orientations. Accuracies of interactive orientations were examined using the reference ALS point cloud that was transformed to the known geodetically determined coordinate system. The coordinate transformation was solved by applying the iterative closest point (ICP) method between the ALS data and the photogrammetrically derived 3 D model, the absolute orientation of which was known. Before making experiments of interactive registration, the absolute orientation of the image block was changed {{in order to get}} incorrect initial orientation. The final results of interactive orientation...|$|R
40|$|Persistent infections by viruses such as HIV- 1 and {{hepatitis}} B virus {{can pose}} long-term health hazards. Because establishment of persistent infections involves <b>close</b> interactions and <b>adjustments</b> in both host and virus, {{it would be}} informative to establish a paradigm with which a normally cytolytic viral infection can be easily converted to persistent infection, so that the different stages in developing persistent infection can be examined. Such a model system is described in this paper. Highly cytolytic encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection was shifted to persistent infection {{as a result of}} repressed expression of the double-stranded RNA- dependent protein kinase (PKR) in the promonocytic U 937 cells. Because of the apoptogenic potential of PKR, a deficiency of PKR resulted in a delay in virus-induced apoptosis in EMCV-infected U 937 cells, allowing the eventual establishment of persistent EMCV infection in these cells (U 9 K-AV 2). That this was a bona fide persistent infection was demonstrated by the ability of infected cells to propagate as long-term virus-shedding cultures; electron microscopy studies showing presence of intracellular EMCV virions and chromatin condensation; detection of virus-induced chromosomal DNA fragmentation and sustained expression of apoptogenic p 53 and IL- 1 β converting enzyme; and demonstration of active EMCV transcription by reverse transcription-PCR. In addition, a host-virus coevolution was observed in U 9 K- AV 2 cultures over time: U 9 K-AV 2 cells exhibited slower growth rates, resistance to viral super-infection, and cessation of IFN-α synthesis, whereas the infectivity of EMCV was drastically attenuated. Finally, data are presented on the suitability of this model to study establishment of persistent infection by other viruses such as Sendai virus and reovirus. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
