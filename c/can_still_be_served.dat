50|$|Georgia and Oklahoma require {{liquor stores}} {{to be closed}} on Sundays. However, alcohol <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>served</b> in {{restaurants}} and bars on Sunday unless local (county or city) ordinances prohibit or restrict their doing so. For instance, in Georgia, most of the Metro Atlanta area counties serve alcohol at restaurants and bars, but the establishments must have {{a certain amount of}} food sales in order to be opened and serve alcohol on Sundays. Yet many of Georgia's rural counties and some outer metropolitan Atlanta counties, such as Barrow County, remain completely dry on Sundays. In those counties on Sundays, bars are closed, and restaurants are allowed to operate but are prohibited from serving alcohol. There was discussion in the Georgia legislature in the late 2000s (decade) to repeal the state's blue laws regarding Sunday retail alcohol sales in a measure to increase tax revenue. However, then-Governor Sonny Perdue said that he would not sign the bills repealing the laws if they passed in Georgia's state house and senate. In Oklahoma, it is illegal to sell packaged liquor (off-premises sales) on Sundays, as well as Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.|$|E
40|$|In many network design {{problems}} {{clients are}} required {{to be connected to}} a facility under path-length constraints and budget limits. Each facility is associated with a tree network where the root is the facility itself and the remaining nodes of the tree are its clients. An inherent feature of these networks is that they are vulnerable to a failure. Therefore, it is often important to provide some resiliency in the network. We focus on a problem where we want to ensure that all clients are connected to two facilities so that if one facility fails then all clients <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>served</b> by another facility. Optionally, one might require that each client is resilient to a single link or node failure by enforcing that the paths used to connect a client to its two facilities are either edge-disjoint or node-disjoint respectively. In this paper we use local search to evaluate the trade-off between cost versus resiliency and coverage versus resiliency for a real-world problem in the field of optical networks...|$|E
50|$|Due {{to the far}} {{reaching}} {{view from}} the Rhön mountains, they became sites for hilltop castles in the Middle Ages. One example is Hauneck Castle (Burg Hauneck) on the Stoppelsberg, the ruins of which <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> seen. It <b>served</b> to oversee and protect traffic on the ancient road, the Antsanvia, as well as protecting the villages in the Haune valley.|$|R

Anyway, it is only a trifling matter, and I am almost ashamed to put it down here in writing--it seems to set the forlornness of our situation in such a miserably vivid light. We must have little indeed to depend on, when the discovery that my memory <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> trusted to <b>serve</b> us <b>is</b> hailed as if it was the discovery of a new friend! ...|$|R
40|$|This book interrogates the {{philosophical}} backdrop of Clausewitzian notions of war, and asks whether modern, network-centric militaries <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> said to <b>serve</b> the ‘political’. In {{light of the}} emerging theories and doctrines of Network-Centric War (NCW), this book traces {{the philosophical}} backdrop against which the more common theorizations of war and its conduct take place. Tracing the historical and philosophical roots of modern war from the 17 th Century through to the present day, this book reveals that far from paralyzing the project of re-problematisating war, the emergence of NCW affords {{us an opportunity to}} rethink war in new and philosophically challenging ways...|$|R
