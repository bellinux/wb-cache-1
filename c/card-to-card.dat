However, air turbulence due to high temperature of electronic components and heat dissipation fans typically results in degradation of system performance through effects such as signal scintillation, beam broadening and beam wander. In this paper, the impact of air turbulence on our recently proposed reconfigurable free-space <b>card-to-card</b> optical interconnect scheme is investigated. Experiments are carried out with lab-emulated moderate and comparatively strong turbulence and {{results show that the}} bit-error-rate (BER) performance of proposed interconnect scheme is degraded. A power penalty of ∼ 0. 5 dB is observed at BER of 10 - 9 in emulated moderate turbulence, and in emulated comparatively strong turbulence the BER performance suffers power penalties of ∼ 1. 6 dB. It should be noted that a BER of 10 - 9 is not sufficient for typical <b>card-to-card</b> optical interconnects and FEC should be employed to improve the BER performance at the cost of some overhead. Nevertheless, experimental results show that our proposed 3 ×, 3 10 Gb/s reconfigurable optical interconnects with <b>card-to-card</b> spacing of up to 30 cm is still achieved even under considerably strong turbulence...|$|E

40|$|The CHORUS {{experiment}} {{searches for}} nu(mu) nu(tau) oscillation. To {{aid in the}} momentum reconstruction of charged hadrons, a honeycomb tracker was built with three orientations of six planes each. The planes are manufactured by point-welding together two precision folded conductive polycarbonate foils, forming hexagonal tubes with 30 mu m thick anode wires in the center. The honeycomb tracker in CHORUS is read out using a bitstream principle. The amplified signal of each wire is binary sampled every 5 ns and stored in a 256 bit circular buffer, implemented in dual-port memories. This technique allows a full reconstruction of a 1. 28 mu s history of each wire. Eighteen cards, each handling 72 wires, are read out over a single flat cable using a <b>card-to-card</b> pipeline.

40|$|LVDS is {{the acronym}} for Low-Voltage-Differential-Signaling and is {{described}} in both the ANSI/TIA/EIA- 644 and IEEE 1596. 3 standards. High performance yet Low Power and EMI have made LVDS a popular choice for high-speed <b>card-to-card</b> serial links. A typical application is the serializer/deserializer (ser/des) function where wide TTL datastreams including clock is converted to a serial LVDS bit stream, sent over a cable, and deserialization and clock recovery performed on the receiving card. This is a powerful design technique but presents interesting challenges from a testability perspective. First, LVDS links have a much different fault spectrum than the well-established stuck-at models used for TTL logic levels. The LVDS interconnect is a transmission line model, where the signal carrying integrity of the cable, fault models and fault detection are very frequency dependent. In addition, the Ser/Des function with clock recovery requires the two devices to achieve synchronization, so efforts to test the link and ser/des functionality must meet the timing requirements of the internal logic. Ideally, any built-in-test capability for the link should be accessible via the JTAG port {{to take advantage of}} the existing industry tools and infrastructure. This paper describes a JTAG activated at-speed BIST technique used to test a high-speed ser/des chip set and cable. 1...|$|E
40|$|As online {{shopping}} services proliferate, {{the need for}} a secure and convenient payment infrastructure becomes critical. While credit card payment has become common for online purchases, a payment solution has not yet been developed {{that can be used to}} support transactions involving a monetary value in the range of a few dollars or even cents. In this study, the authors report their experience in developing a smart card based micropayment infrastructure in collaboration with a major bank. The infrastructure makes use of Mondex, a cash card standard adopted by major financial institutions worldwide. The infrastructure provides a platform to support online transfer of Mondex value over the Internet. Unlike other cash card products, Mondex is the only standard that can support <b>card-to-card</b> transfer without a mediating party. The transactions are immediate and anonymous. This article outlines the technical approach used in the development of the infrastructure and presents a behavioral adoption model to identify and assess factors that may affect its adoption. The findings indicate that the use of the adoption model in the early stages of product development can provide valuable insights to a development team. Theoretical contributions and practical implications specific to the Mondex Internet micropayment infrastructure are also discussed...|$|E
