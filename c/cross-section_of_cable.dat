40|$|The {{magnetic}} field is not constant over the <b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> superconductors. This work assesses different cable layouts from round to rectangular and square cross-section {{to define and}} compare their current sharing temperature and effective {{magnetic field}}. We discuss of the effective field vs cable layout parameters, {{the pros and cons}} applicable to fusion. One of the most important challenges is to control the plasma in fusion reactors is design high performance superconducting magnets. Fusion was achieved in JET reactor but actually a self-sustained fusion is the goal to make new fusion energy plants. The project which could achieve this self-sustained fusion reaction is ITER reactor. ITER most powerful magnets are the toroidal field coil and the central solenoid coil. The magnetic fields of these coils are generated through CICC made with superconducting materials. The material treated in this work is Nb 3 Sn. The TF coils and its conductors are described to have an idea about how they work and the importance of its effective magnetic field. This Master Dissertation tries to identify what are the best cross-section layout for different rectangular and square cross-section conductors, as compared to the round shape conductors employed in ITER reactor. The work is simulated through a MATLAB software. The simulations can describe the magnetic field distribution in different shaped conductors which share the same area. Once we have the magnetic field distribution we can simulate the critical current density distribution and finally the electric field distribution. With the different electric field distributions for different temperatures we found the current sharing temperature where the electric field average in the conductor is equal to the critical electric field. Finally, when we obtain the Tcs we can calculate the effective magnetic field for each aspect ratio of rectangular shapes and compare it with round conductors to draw conclusions.

40|$|Artículos en revistasIn {{the coming}} years, an {{extensive}} development of large-scale offshore wind farms (OWFs) is foreseen in Europe. Electric power systems of OWFs {{need to be}} optimized {{in order to minimize}} investment and operational costs. This paper proposes a comprehensive decision support model that covers the three key factors that characterize the design of ac electric power systems of OWFs: investment costs of the components, system efficiency, and system reliability. Stochasticity of wind speed and reliability of the main system components are also considered. The main decisions concern the layout and the <b>cross-sections</b> <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> connections and the location of the central collection point for the medium voltage cables. GAMS language has been used to implement the model. It has been validated using a real OWF. An application example has also been carried out to explain the extension of the model to OWFs with dc power systems. The proposed model is useful for basic engineering design and as a decision tool for planning the electric power system of OWFs. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Large-span {{cable stayed}} bridges design is {{impossible}} without a cable adjustment, {{which should be}} made {{in various stages of}} construction and for finished structure alike. There may be many concepts of regulation – the creation of design geometry (mainly used for relatively small span pedestrian bridges), the optimization of shear or moment diagrams in carriageway’s construction, the reduction of maximum tensile or compressive stresses in the load-bearing elements. Normally, the choice of mechanical and geometrical parameters for the main load bearing elements (cables, stiffness girder and pylons) which affect the flexibility of a bridge structure is an iterative process based on the structural engineering experience. The assumptions are to be tested by the FEM calculations and changed if necessary. This paper offers insight into the mathematical methods developed, based on the deformed shape of the cable-stayed bridge system. The method developed is demonstrated by example, where the system is optimized according to the type of cable-stayed bridge ("star" or "harp" design), geometrical parameters (lengths of stiffness beam sections, height of pylons) and the stiffness parameters (<b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> <b>cables,</b> flexibility <b>of</b> the girder).

40|$|The cable {{equation}} {{describes the}} voltage {{in a straight}} cylindrical cable, this model has been employed to model electrical potential in dendrites and axons. However, sometimes this equation might give incorrect predictions for some realistic geometries, in particular when the radius <b>of</b> the <b>cable</b> changes significantly. Cables with a non constant radius are important for some phenomena, for example discrete swellings along the axons appear in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, HIV-associated dementia and Multiple Sclerosis. In this paper, using the Frenet-Serret frame, we propose a generalized cable equation for a general cable geometry. This generalized equation depends on geometric quantities such as the curvature and torsion <b>of</b> the <b>cable.</b> We show that when the cable has a constant circular cross-section, the first fundamental form <b>of</b> the <b>cable</b> can be simplified and the generalized cable equation depends on neither the curvature nor the torsion <b>of</b> the <b>cable.</b> Additionally, we find an exact solution for an ideal cable which has a particular variable circular cross-section and zero curvature. For this case we show that when the <b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cable</b> increases the voltage decreases. Inspired in this ideal case, we rewrite the generalized cable equation as a diffusion equation with a source term generated by the cable geometry. This source term depends on the cable cross-section area and its derivates. In addition, we study different cables with swelling and provide their numerical solutions. The numerical solutions show that when the <b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cable</b> has abrupt changes, its voltage is smaller than the voltage in the cylindrical cable. Furthermore, these numerical solutions show that the voltage can be affected by geometrical inhomogeneities on the cable. Comment: 13 page, 7 figure...|$|R

40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) magnitudes from classical detection {{techniques are}} {{expressed in terms of}} apparent charges. Signals from HF/VHF/UHF techniques on substation components are often hard to express in this quantity because of complex signal excitation and propagation channels. A method to calibrate PD signals obtained during online inductive detection in medium voltage belted cables is described. online inductive detection implies that the impedances of components present in substations essentially determine the detected PD signal magnitude. The use <b>of</b> belted <b>cables</b> means, that the coupling of a PD event to the conductors not only depends on the PD site within the <b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cable</b> or cable accessory, but also becomes dependent on the momentary phase angle. In addition, during signal propagation the signal magnitude may alter according to the propagation modes <b>of</b> a multi-conductor <b>cable.</b> These aspects are studied quantitatively by the use of theoretical modelling in addition to offline and online experiments.

40|$|Prestressed {{suspension}} bridge {{is a type}} of structures which allows covering long spans due to rational use of structural materials. Prestressing of {{suspension bridge}} allows to minimize cinematic displacements and makes possible not to use cantlage. The stress distribution by the length of the main load carrying <b>cable</b> <b>of</b> suspension bridge is non-uniform. Equalization of stresses by the length <b>of</b> the <b>cable</b> open possibility to increase degree of material usage. The effects of stress equalization by the length <b>of</b> the <b>cable</b> can be achieved with the using <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> with variable by it length cross-section.

40|$|Abstract A stress ribbon {{pedestrian}} bridge is the structure {{in which the}} axial force of prestressed deck, which is developed by introducing prestressed force into the thin deck with the very low value of span to deck-depth ratio which is installed on bearing cables with the specified sag, resists most of external loadings.

The width of the dashed black lines is intended to show relative strength of the magnetic field integrated over the circumference at that radius. The four stages, A, B, C, and D are: non-energized, low frequency, middle frequency and high frequency respectively. There are three regions that may contain induced magnetic fields: the center conductor, the dielectric and the outer conductor. In stage B, current covers the conductors uniformly and there is a significant magnetic field in all three regions. As the frequency is increased and the skin effect takes hold (C and D) the magnetic field in the dielectric region is unchanged as it is proportional to the total current flowing in the center conductor. In C, however, there is a reduced magnetic field in the deeper sections of the inner conductor and the outer sections of the shield (outer conductor). Thus there is less energy stored in the magnetic field given the same total current, corresponding to a reduced inductance. At an even higher frequency, D, the skin depth is tiny: all current is confined {{to the surface of the}} conductors. The only magnetic field is in the regions between the conductors; only the [...] "external inductance" [...] remains.|$|R

40|$|Cable stayed bridges {{have good}} stability, optimum use of {{structural}} materials, aesthetic, relatively low design and maintenance costs, and efficient structural characteristics. Therefore, {{this type of}} bridges {{are becoming more and}} more popular and are usually preferred for long span crossings compared to suspension bridges. A cable-stayed bridge consists of one or more towers with cables supporting the bridge deck. In terms <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> arrangements, the most common type <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> stayed bridges are fan, harp, and semi fan bridges. Because of their large size and nonlinear structural behaviour, the analysis of these types of bridges is more complicated than conventional bridges. In these bridges, the cables are the main source of nonlinearity. Obtaining the optimum distribution <b>of</b> post-tensioning <b>cable</b> forces is an important task and plays a major role in optimizing the design <b>of</b> <b>cable</b> stayed bridges. An optimum design of a cable-stayed bridge with minimum cost while achieving strength and serviceability requirements is a challenging task. In this thesis, an advanced and comprehensive numerical model is used to obtain the post-tensioning forces and the optimum design of the three types of cable-stayed bridge. The numerical method is based on finite element, B-spline curves, and real coded genetic algorithm. The optimization accounts for all the variables that define the geometry and <b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> the bridge.
