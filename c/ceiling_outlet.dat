40|$|The {{definition}} and governing equation of probability density function (PDF) {{have been implemented}} in the present work. The procedure {{is applied to the}} backward time identification of the pollutant probability density function history and finally the maximal probability density of airborne pollutant source location in a two-dimensional slot ventilated building enclosure contained with two solid blocks. Steady-state airflow field, sensor location, boundary conditions, thermo-physical properties and geometric characteristics should be known in prior. Spatial probability density function history has been computed under four ventilation modes, i. e., mixed ventilation (MV), displacement ventilation (DV), mixed ventilation with top <b>ceiling</b> <b>outlet</b> (MVS), and displacement ventilation with left side outlet (DVS). Effects of pollutant source location and alarming sensor on the accuracy of the probability density function have been disclosed. The pollutant sources will be more easily identified for the concentrated pollutant strips, where pollutant diffusion is efficient compared with the pollutant source at outlet. Particularly, the good agreement of the probability density function identified source location with the true situation fully shows that adjoint probability density function method is more competitive in the engineering applications involving with complicated convective fluid flows.

40|$|This Strategy Guideline {{discusses}} {{the benefits and}} challenges of using a compact air distribution system to handle the reduced loads and reduced air volume needed to condition the space within an energy efficient home. Traditional systems sized by 'rule of thumb' (i. e., 1 ton of cooling per 400 ft 2 of floor space) that 'wash' the exterior walls with conditioned air from floor registers cannot provide appropriate air mixing and moisture removal in low-load homes. A compact air distribution system locates the HVAC equipment centrally with shorter ducts run to interior walls, and <b>ceiling</b> supply <b>outlets</b> throw the air toward the exterior walls along the ceiling plane; alternatively, high sidewall supply outlets throw the air toward the exterior walls. Potential drawbacks include resistance from installing contractors or code officials who are unfamiliar with compact air distribution systems, {{as well as a}} lack of availability of low-cost high sidewall or <b>ceiling</b> supply <b>outlets</b> to meet the low air volumes with good throw characteristics. The decision criteria for a compact air distribution system must be determined early in the whole-house design process, considering both supply and return air design. However, careful installation of a compact air distribution system can result in lower material costs from smaller equipment, shorter duct runs, and fewer outlets; increased installation efficiencies, including ease of fitting the system into conditioned space; lower loads on a better balanced HVAC system, and overall improved energy efficiency of the home...|$|R
40|$|A gasodynamic {{study of}} a model of hood space was {{performed}} based on measurements of velocity and concentra-tion distributions of gases. The experiments {{have shown that the}} absolute values of gas velocities in the hood and the outlet channel as well as their profi les do not depend on the negative pressure value in the channel. Location of <b>ceiling</b> nozzle <b>outlets</b> does not signifi cantly aff ect the gasodynamic parameters of the hood space. Moreover, uni-form distribution of the air, delivered through the ceiling nozzles, has been observed in the whole hood space, which creates conditions for afterburning of gaseous reaction products in this space.

50|$|The next morning, Mike {{disrupts}} the instructor's foot race and punctures the tyres of the instructor's car while Susan is driving it. Susan gets mad and hits Mike, {{in the process}} losing the diamond from her new engagement ring in the snow. Anxious to find the lost diamond, Mike and Susan collect the surrounding snow in plastic bags and {{take it back to}} the closed baths to melt it, using a lowered <b>ceiling</b> lamp <b>outlet</b> to heat an electric kettle in the empty pool. While Susan is briefly out of the room, Mike finds the diamond in the melted snow, and lies down naked in the dry pool with the diamond on his tongue. He teases Susan by refusing to give her the diamond until she undresses. She does so, he gives her the diamond and she is about to leave, but she reconsiders and lies down next to him. They have a sexual encounter, although {{it is not clear whether}} Mike is able to perform.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{displacement}} ventilation system, {{relying on}} air supply through the ceiling, has been developed, installed and investigated in the Do 728 test {{bed of the}} German Aerospace Center. The system uses a new <b>ceiling</b> air <b>outlet</b> concept, which allows for simultaneous supply of air and further functions like e. g. lighting or acoustic damping in future applications. Six different ventilation scenarios, among them mixing ventilation, cabin displacement ventilation, ceiling based displacement as well as combined ceiling and floor based dis-placement ventilation were studied and compared. Passenger thermal dummies were used to simulate ex-perimentally {{the impact of the}} passengers under real conditions. Flow velocities, fluid temperatures and sur-face temperatures were measured in the cabin, including the vicinity of the passenger dummies. This data was used to determine integral quantities like the temperature difference between cabin air and incoming air, the heat removal efficiency, the mean temperature stratification and the mean velocity levels in order to analyze and score the ventilation scenarios. A combined operation of the floor and ceiling based displacement ventilation system can ensure at once high heat removal efficiencies as well as predictably comfortable flow conditions...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Total Artificial Hearts (TAHs) act as {{a bridge}} to {{transplantation}} or destination therapy for patients with terminal heart insufficiency. Recirculation areas are prone to thrombus formation, especially for long-term applications. Therefore, inadequate pump washout results in excessive thromboembolic risk. In this study the TAH ReinHeart, a double chamber membrane pump actuated by pusher plates, is investigated. The rotational orientation of the bileaflet mechanical heart valve (MHV) at the inflow has {{a significant effect on}} the flow pattern within the pump volume during each pump cycle. Therefore, it is expected that the washout is also sensitive to the rotational orientation of the MHV. In order to determine optimal valve orientation regarding the washout of the volume a numerical two-phase Fluid-Structure-Interaction (FSI) model was developed. Materials & Methods: Complex membrane kinematics necessitated fully coupled 3 D FSI simulations to accurately predict the pumping process. A commercial partitioned block-GaussâSeidel coupling package was used. In order to achieve coupling stability (âartificial added mass effectâ), the interface artificial compressibility method was applied. The augmented Lagrange formulation was used to enforce the frictional contact conditions between the structural contact pairs. To maintain mesh quality and to prevent inversion of fluid elements in regions of large deformation, the mesh stiffness of the fluid elements was defined as a function of mesh properties. The preload was applied to the fluid inlet by using a fixed pressure opening, whereas the systolic afterload at the fluid outlet was modeled by combining a fixed relative pressure opening and a fluid resistance based on the DarcyâWeisbach equation. Independence tests were performed for the structural and the fluid mesh as well as the time step size and the number of pulse cycles. Validation of the FSI model was performed using stereo Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements and high-speed recordings of the actual pump. In order to investigate the washout of the old blood by the new blood a homogeneous, immiscible two-phase flow model was used. The same non-Newtonian blood model was applied for both phases. Initially, the whole chamber was filled with fluid 1 (old blood). Several heart cycles with only fluid 1 entering the volume were simulated until pulse cycle independence was reached. Subsequently, fluid 2 (new blood) with a volume fraction of 1 was defined at the inlet. Four TAH geometries with 0 Â°, 45 Â°, 90 Â° and 135 Â° inlet valve orientation were created, where 0 Â° means that the MHV is oriented vertical to the chamber <b>ceiling.</b> The <b>outlet</b> valve was kept in the same orientation (0 Â°). The two-phase FSI model is currently applied to all geometries. Results: The flow fields and membrane motion correspond well with the PIV measurements and high-speed recordings, respectively For all valve orientations, at least three heart cycles were necessary to achieve adequate washout of the pump chamber volume. The remaining volume of fluid 1 in the chamber after three heart cycles was 0. 12 % and 0. 48 % for 0 Â° and 90 Â°, respectively. Remains of old blood can be observed mainly {{in the corner of the}} membrane and the housing opposite the inlet and outlet where velocities are low. Furthermore, washout quarter-time and washout half-time are currently compared for all geometries. Conclusions: The numerical two-phase Fluid-Structure-Interaction model was developed and is currently applied to investigate chamber washout of a Total Artificial Heart. Four geometries with different rotational orientations of the inlet MHV were created and are compared regarding washout efficiency. First results of this approach are promising concerning the detection of stagnant blood areas. Besides valve orientation, different heart valve types and chamber designs could be evaluated and compared in order to reduce the potential for thrombus formation. Furthermore, based on the washout efficiency as well as estimated stresses a design optimization of the chamber unit, pusher plate and membrane is possible...|$|R
