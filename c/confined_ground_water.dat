40|$|The water {{shortage}} {{due to the}} lack of precipitation in rainy season in 1994 has made a serious damage on many regions in Japan. Especially, not only Nagasaki and Sasebo city but the isolated islands in the Nagasaki prefecture have been suffered by {{water shortage}}. One of the solution for water shortage is the construction of the underground dam in the suitable site in islands. This paper deals with the case history of the <b>confined</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> fluctuation analysis of the Nomozaki underground dam in the Nagasaki prefecture using by iterative quasi-three-demensional finite element model for heterogeneous multi-aquifer systems. This study is the first step to develop the selection method for the optimum underground dam site in the isolated islands...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical {{model is}} {{presented}} on the phenomena of sea water intrusion into <b>confined</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> {{to make it}} clear the relationship between the pumping amount of fresh water and the corresponding spatial distribution of salt water in three-dimensional treatment. At first, the differential equations are derived in fresh and salinized regions, respectively, from the fundamental equation in confined water. The equation in salinized region, {{which is one of the}} quasi-linear differential equations, can be transformed to a linear one and then is continued to the equation in fresh region, resulting in the two-dimensional Poisson's equation which is been applicable to entire region. This equation in steady state is generally solved in integral form by using the method of Green's function and is simply expressed in the case of idealized field conditions analogous to a fan-shaped alluvium by the usual method of images. Finally, some numerical examples are shown in the case of uniform pumpage in a circular region...|$|E
40|$|The {{variation}} {{of the level of}} the ground water table involves the total effect of hydrological elements necessary to determine the budget of water balance under the ground. It then appears that the value of each element can be found by analysing the state of variation in the water level. Long time records of the water level in a well in Beppu City are analysed according to the approximate theory concerning the effect of precipitation on the ground water stream under water table conditions. The result is used to estimate the water budget in the basin. A part of precipitation does not {{have an effect on the}} ground water stream and its rate is obtained by the method of analysing the declining state of the water level as being about one-third of the precipitation. This value shows good agreement with the observed effect of precipitation. A part of the supply to the lower <b>confined</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> in the upstream part of the basin does not come back to the upper unconfined aquifer owing to artificial withdrawals from the lower aquifer. Its rate is estimated and compared with the rate of withdrawals of hot water in the city. They recently show a clear tendency to be increased...|$|E
40|$|Redox {{conditions}} exercise important {{controls on}} water chemistry in the red-bed Sherwood Sandstone Aquifer of the English East Midlands. A distinct redox boundary exists some 3 to 5 km downgradient of {{the onset of}} confined conditions, defined by a 300 mV drop in Eh and complete reaction of dissolved oxygen. The aerobic aquifer contains polluted water with high nitrate concentrations and organic carbon significantly above background concentrations (> 0. 2 mg/L). Concentrations of Fe, Mn, and Mo are highest in reducing <b>ground</b> <b>water.</b> As, Sb, Se, and U show a residence-time-dependent increase in aerobic <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> but are much lower under reducing conditions. Iron oxides are believed to {{play a key role}} in determining the spatial patterns in many of these trace elements as a result of Eh- and pH-controlled sorption/desorption reactions, as well as some reductive dissolution in the <b>confined</b> aquifer. Fresh <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> persists in the confined aquifer to approximately 30 km downgradient of the redox boundary. However, SO 4 concentrations increase progressively along the flowline as a result of the dissolution of gypsum or anhydrite. Concentrations of available organic carbon are low in <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> (1 mg/L or less) and are also likely to be limited in the sediments; conditions are insufficiently reducing for significant sulphate reduction to have taken place. Only in the extreme down-gradient (eastern) part of the aquifer do conditions become sufficiently reducing with some evidence of sulphate reduction. In this part of the aquifer, <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> is more saline (TDS values up to 10 g/L) and is believed to be composed substantially of older formation water. This has distinctive concentrations of several redox-influenced trace elements, with relatively high Fe, Mn, As, and Sb, occasional high Cr, and low Mo relative to the <b>confined</b> fresh <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> upgradient. ...|$|R
40|$|Three {{aquifers}} {{of diverse}} lithology and hydraulic character form the ground-water reservoir in the Roswell basin. The main aquifer, the carbonate aquifer, is developed in carbonate rocks of Permian age. It {{is the source}} of about two-thirds of the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> pumped in the basin and receives more than 90 percent of the recharge to the basin. The second most important aquifer is the shallow aquifer which lies near the Pecos River in beds of sand and gravel of both Permian and Holocene age. About one-third of the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> pumped in the basin comes from the shallow aquifer. Prior to pumping, the main source of recharge to the shallow aquifer was probably <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> leaking upward from the carbonate aquifer. Since pumping began, the main source of recharge to the shallow aquifer is probably return flow of irrigation water pumped from the carbonate aquifer. Natural discharge of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> from the shallow aquifer into the Pecos River causes a gain in th. e base flow of the Pecos River in the Roswell basin. The third aquifer, the shallow-artesian aquifer, is in red beds and evaporite beds of Permian age. This aquifer overlies the carbonate aquifer and underlies the shallow aquifer. The shallow-artesian aquifer acts as a minor aquifer and also as a semi-permeable unit which partly <b>confines</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> in the carbonate aquifer. Vertical permeability of the shallow-artesian aquifer is variable and depends on the lithology and thickness of the aquifer. Hydraulic head in the shallow-artesian aquifer also varies quite widely depending on the depth to which a well penetrates the aquifer. All ground-water aquifers in the basin transect formational boundaries and are therefore not closely related to the named geologic formations. A flow net analysis of the carbonate aquifer and of the shallow aquifer imply that geologic structure is important in the movement of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> in the basin by limiting the transmissivity of the shallow and carbonate aquifers, by forming the present pattern of surface water drainage, and possibly by the contamination of fresh <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> by highly saline <b>ground</b> <b>water.</b> The flow net analysis also shows areas of recharge to the shallow and carbonate aquifers, and areas where the carbonate aquifer looses water to the shallow-artesian aquifer and to the shallow aquifer...|$|R

40|$|Lake Havasu City is in {{the seventh}} year of a {{centralized}} wastewater expansion program intended to replace almost 28, 000 septic tanks. The resultant increase in effluent generation has promoted the City to initiate a vadose zone injection well process to store excess effluent in alluvial fan sediments for later use. The unconfined Colorado River Aquifer created when Parker Dam impounded the river 70 years ago, is approximately 400 feet below ground surface at the injection site 2. 5 miles east of Lake Havasu. Aquifer tests in the unconsolidated alluvial sands and gravels have indicated low to moderate hydraulic conductivities due to interstitial silt and monitoring wells indicate a very flat water table surface (6 - 8 ft/mile) suggesting slow water migration rates. Water temperature, static water head, general chemistry and stable isotope trends in ground water from Lake Havasu eastward to the mountain foothills indicate two different hydrological regimes. The lake derived aquifer mixes with heated <b>confined</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> emanating from faulted volcanic rocks adjacent to the Mohave Mountains.

This study was conducted where Little Stony Creek flows into East Park Reservoir on the east front of the Coast Range, northern California. Little Stony Creek water, Hyphus Creek water, Franciscan Complex regional <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> Great Valley Group regional <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> and local shallow <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> were collected during wet and dry seasons and were analyzed for deuterium, oxygen- 18, temperature, pH, redox potential, conductivity, and major cation and anion concentrations. Turnover in the local flow system is rapid indicating that local shallow <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> is dependent on recent recharge. Local shallow <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> is recharged primarily by Little Stony Creek water and Franciscan Complex <b>ground</b> <b>water.</b> In the wet season, Little Stony Creek is the more prominent source of local shallow <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> and the ratio of Little Stony Creek water to Franciscan Complex <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> decreases with distance from the channel. In the dry season, Franciscan Complex <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> is the more prominent source of local shallow <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> and the ratio of Little Stony Creek water to Franciscan Complex <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> decreases with distance down the valley.

Hydrochemical and in situ parameters, as well as δ 18 O in <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> samples collected in the tunnel, show only small temporal variations. The precipitation record of δ 18 O shows seasonal variations of ~ 14 ‰ and a decrease of 0. 23 ‰ ± 0. 03 ‰ per 100 m elevation gain. δ 2 H and δ 18 O in precipitation are well correlated and plot close to the meteoric water line, as well as δ 2 H and δ 18 O in <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> samples, reflecting the meteoric origin of the latter. The depletion of 18 O in <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> compared to 18 O content in precipitation during the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharge period indicates significant contributions from accumulated depleted winter precipitation to <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharge.

40|$|Land {{reclamation}} {{has been}} a common practice to produce valuable land in coastal areas. The impact of land reclamation on coastal environment and marine ecology is well recognized and widely studied. It has not been recognized yet that reclamation may change the regional <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> regime, which may in turn modify the coastal environment, flooding pattern, and stability of slopes and foundations. This paper represents the first attempt to examine quantitatively the effect of reclamation on <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> levels. Analytical solutions are developed to study the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> change in response to reclamation based on two hypothetical models. In the first model, the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow regime changes only in the hillside around the reclamation areas. In the second model, the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> regime changes in the entire hill. Both models assume that the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow is in a steady state and satisfies the Dupuit assumptions.

Thus, a quantitative evaluation of spatial and temporal distribution of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharge is a pre-requisite for operating <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> resources system in an optimal manner. This paper presents a methodology with step-by-step procedure to determine the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharge by soil moisture balance in the unsaturated zone...|$|R

In rural Minnesota {{almost all of}} our <b>water</b> used is <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> and 93 percent of all {{municipal}} systems use it. St. Paul now uses some <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> and Minneapolis is considering its use to supplement water from the Mississippi River.

But in recent years, due to over exploitation of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> and erratic nature of monsoon, there has been depletion of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> across the world. Depletion of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> has reached {{to the extent that}} it is virtually impossible to get the water table back. Even though there is a possibility of recharge of water from the other areas, the process is very slow and may take one year to replenish one meter. In view of this management of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> has become one of the most significant issues in recent times. Added to it, there are also environmental problems such as aqua for mining, salt water intrusion, stream base flow reduction etc. For several reasons the efficient management of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> resources through market mechanism has become difficult. Against this context the present article attempts to analyze the need for sustainable <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> management in India. The article also briefly discusses the concept of sustainable <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> management, factors affecting <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> availability, different approaches towards developing and using available <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> with out adversely affecting the hydro-geological balance. Further, the paper highlights strategie...|$|R
