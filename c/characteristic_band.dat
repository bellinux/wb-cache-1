Lattice constants of atomic crystals are {{of the order of}} 1Å while those of superlattices (a) are several hundreds or thousands larger as dictated by technological limits (e.g. electron-beam lithography used for the patterning of the heterostructure surface).

50|$|The {{process by}} which a photon initiates a {{chemical}} reaction directly is known as photolysis; if this process is aided by a catalyst, it is called photocatalysis. If a photon has more energy than a material's <b>characteristic</b> <b>band</b> gap, it can free an electron upon absorption by the material. The remaining, positively charged hole and the free electron may recombine, generating heat, or they can take part in photoreactions with nearby species. If the photoreactions with these species result in regeneration of the electron-donating material—i.e., if the material acts {{as a catalyst for}} the reactions—then the reactions are deemed photocatalytic. PECO represents a type of photocatalysis whereby semiconductor-based electrochemistry catalyzes an oxidation reaction—for example, the oxidative degradation of an airborne contaminant in air purification systems.|$|E

30|$|The Raman {{spectrum}} of Artocarpus heterophyllus heartwood, which {{proved to be}} a rich source of flavonoids, exhibited two <b>characteristic</b> <b>bands,</b> at 1247 [*]cm− 1 and 745 [*]cm− 1. The bands also appeared in the Raman {{spectrum of}} the yellow-brown needles extracted from the heartwood with methanol. Based on the Raman measurements of flavones and related compounds, it was predicted that the Raman band at 1247 [*]cm− 1 may be attributed to flavonoid-type compounds. No vibrational band corresponding to the <b>characteristic</b> Raman <b>bands</b> was observed by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy. Thus, it was suggested that observation of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>bands</b> is an advantage of Fourier transform-Raman spectroscopy for nondestructive analysis of wood.|$|R

40|$|Biomarker molecules, such as amino acids, {{are key to}} {{discovering}} whether life exists {{elsewhere in}} the Solar System. Raman spectroscopy, a technique capable of detecting biomarkers, will be on board future planetary missions including the ExoMars rover. Generally, {{the position of the}} strongest band in the spectra of amino acids is reported as the identifying band. However, for an unknown sample, it is desirable to define multiple <b>characteristic</b> <b>bands</b> for molecules to avoid any ambiguous identification. To date, there has been no definition of multiple <b>characteristic</b> <b>bands</b> for amino acids of interest to astrobiology. This study examinedL-alanine, L-aspartic acid, L-cysteine, L-glutamine and glycine and defined several Raman bands per molecule for reference as characteristic identifiers. Per amino acid, 240 spectra were recorded and compared using established statistical tests including ANOVA. The number of <b>characteristic</b> <b>bands</b> defined were 10, 12, 12, 14 and 19 for L-alanine (strongest intensity band: 832 cm - 1), L-aspartic acid (938 cm - 1), L-cysteine (679 cm - 1),L-glutamine (1090 cm − 1) and glycine (875 cm - 1), respectively. The intensity of bands differed by up to six times when several points on the crystal sample were rotated through 360 °; to reduce this effect when defining <b>characteristic</b> <b>bands</b> for other molecules, we find that spectra should be recorded at a statistically significant number of points per sample to remove the effect of sample rotation.
