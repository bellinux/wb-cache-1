5|$|A 1991 {{agreement}} between the City of Portland and the State of Oregon to dramatically reduce combined sewer overflows (CSOs) led to Portland's Big Pipe Project. The project, part of a related series of Portland CSO projects completed in late 2011 {{at a cost of}} $1.44billion, separates the city's sanitary sewer lines from storm-water inputs that sometimes overwhelmed the <b>combined</b> <b>system</b> during heavy rains. When that occurred, some of the raw sewage in the system flowed into the river instead of into the city's wastewater treatment plant. The Big Pipe project and related work reduces CSO volume on the lower river by about 94percent.|$|E
5|$|The Command and Service Modules were mated in the KSC {{altitude}} chamber in September, and <b>combined</b> <b>system</b> testing was performed.

The returned ECU then leaked water/glycol coolant, and had to be returned a second time. Also during this time, a propellant tank in Service Module 017 had ruptured during testing at NAA, prompting the separation of the modules and removal from the chamber so the Service Module could be tested for signs of the tank problem. These tests were negative.|$|E

5|$|Although Fausto headed {{generally}} northwest while {{a tropical}} cyclone, it curved west-northwest after degenerating into a remnant low. Passing several hundred {{miles north of}} Hawaii, deep convection began to re-develop as the remnants of Fausto interacted with a tropical upper tropospheric trough. By 1800 UTC on August28, the low had enough deep convection to be reclassified as a tropical depression while located roughly 635mi (1020km) north of Oahu. No further re-intensification occurred for almost 48 hours, and then Fausto became a tropical storm again at 1800 UTC September1. This regeneration at high latitude was attributed to a temperature anomaly with waters 3.4°F (2°C) above normal and a favorable upper-level atmospheric pattern. Although sea surface temperature anomalies are usually attributed {{to the development of}} an El Niño, the El Niño had no effect with atmospheric conditions. A mid-latitude cyclone approached Tropical Storm Fausto and caused the system to accelerate northward. The mid-latitude cyclone eventually absorbed Fausto, and the <b>combined</b> <b>system</b> reached the Aleutian Islands of Alaska shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Three {{additional}} system {{models were}} created by other electronics companies. Working with Sega, JVC released the Wondermega on April 1, 1992, in Japan, at an initial retail price of ¥82,800 (or US$620). The system was later redesigned by JVC and released as the X'Eye in North America in September 1994. Designed by JVC to be a Genesis and Sega CD combination with high-quality audio, the Wondermega's high price kept {{it out of the}} hands of average consumers. Likewise was the case with the Pioneer LaserActive, which was also an add-on that required an attachment developed by Sega, known as the Mega-LD pack, in order to play Genesis and Sega CD games. Though the LaserActive, developed by Pioneer Corporation, was lined up to compete with the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, the <b>combined</b> <b>system</b> and Mega-LD pack retailed at nearly $1600, becoming a very expensive option for Sega CD players. Aiwa also released the CSD-GM1, a combination Genesis/Sega CD unit built into a boombox.|$|E

The <b>combining</b> <b>system</b> attempts to compensate for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss resulting from antenna deformations induced by gravitational and atmospheric effects. The combining weights are obtained directly from the observed residual carrier samples in each channel using a 'sliding-window' implementation of a maximum-likelihood (ML) parameter estimator. It is shown that with averaging times of about 0. 1 s, combining loss for a seven-element array can be limited to about 0. 1 dB in a realistic operational environment.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{irreversible}} processes {{that result in}} an increase of the entropy. See: Entropy production.

The mixing is accompanied by the entropy of mixing. In the important case of mixing of ideal gases, the <b>combined</b> <b>system</b> does not change its internal energy by work or heat transfer; the entropy increase is then entirely due to the spreading of the different substances into their new common volume.|$|E
