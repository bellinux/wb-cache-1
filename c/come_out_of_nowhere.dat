25|$|In Allen's opinion, {{the problem}} with Funny Lady was that Barbra Streisand had not {{wanted to do a}} sequel to Funny Girl and was {{determined}} to give the director, Herbert Ross, a hard time. Ray Stark had her cross-collateralized on three films and she was, figuratively speaking, escorted to the set every day by a team of lawyers. The picture does, however, contain some of Allen's most satisfying work, some of which she doesn't remember writing and just seems to have <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{suddenly}} as they appeared, the tourists vanish. The fugitive {{returns to the}} museum to investigate and finds no evidence of people being there during his absence. He attributes the experience to a hallucination caused by food poisoning, but the tourists reappear that night. They have <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> and yet they talk {{as if they have}} been there for a while. He watches them closely while still avoiding direct contact and notices more strange things. In the aquarium he encounters identical copies of the dead fish he found on his day of arrival. During a day at the pool, he sees the tourists jump to shake off the cold when the heat is unbearable. The strangest thing he notices is the presence of two suns and two moons in the sky.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix {{wrote about}} the [...] "palpable, painful sense of dread throughout this episode", stating: [...] "Though Lane's tax trouble seemed to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> a few weeks ago...all of his behavior, and Don's, felt very true to form, and not like characters acting in a way designed to create a specific end point. Lane was doomed, but by his own actions and foibles as much as by any plot engineering to get that noose around his neck." [...] The Guardians Paul McInnes felt the series was [...] "recovering its poise" [...] {{on its way to}} the season finale, stating: [...] "After dallying with melodrama (Pete and Beth Dawes, Harry and Hari Kinsey), the show has moved back towards the darker, more sophisticated narratives of cause and unexpected consequence. This week Lane may have taken his own life, but Don also got his mojo back and the two were directly related." [...] Verne Gay of Newsday compared the characters of Lane Pryce and Don Draper, stating: [...] "Both have secret lives protected by carefully constructed façades. For both, the façade is everything — and Lane's would simply fall away, like a line of dominoes when confronted with the consequences of his lie. A lie, after all, made in the service of his son." ...|$|E

[...] "Tonight" [...] has an instrumentation of a disco bass, and the drumbeat and bass of the song [...] "makes the song the most authentically danceable on the album," [...] according to Popmatters. [...] "I Wonder" [...] has a [...] "chopped and screwed beat and dancing piano lines" [...] that [...] "is club pop for the PBR set," [...] according to Paste Magazine.

2500|$|In the woods, David and Emma find Hyde, {{and this}} time he is ready as he overpowers them almost immediately, only to have Gold <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> and stabs him in the heart with the serum-covered dagger, but that fails as well, as Hyde tells Gold that he {{switched}} serums with Jekyll earlier, then takes the Dark One’s dagger and uses it to control Gold to [...] take him to Belle. When the two appeared in front of the Jolly Roger, Hyde says that there is one final twist. It turns out that that Jekyll is actually the ruthless one, as his aggressive behavior starts to worry Belle as she attempts to use the seashell to contact Hook but Jekyll breaks it, and her attempt to escape is prevented by the protection spell, and all Gold and Hyde can do is look on. Fortunately, Hook arrived just in time to save Belle by not only killing Jekyll, but also killing Hyde. Realizing that the same thing can happen because Jekyll and Hyde are still the same person, and therefore likewise with her and the Evil Queen, Regina ask Emma to [...] "do what is necessary" [...] to keep from returning to evil, while an angry Belle confronts Gold about his deal with Hyde. He reveals that, back when she was a slave in his castle, he was worried about the feelings he had for her. Gold sought out Jekyll to see if his serum could rid people of [...] "weakness," [...] but when his experiment failed, he angrily banished Hyde to the Land of Untold Stories. Belle is still distrustful with Gold, but he insists she will need him to protect their child, claiming that “necessity” will make her love him once again.|$|E

60|$|Then Mowgli {{picked out}} a shady place, and lay down and slept while the buffaloes grazed round him. Herding in India {{is one of the}} laziest things in the world. The cattle move and crunch, and lie down, and move on again, and they do not even low. They only grunt, and the buffaloes very seldom say anything, but get down into the muddy pools one after another, and work their way into the mud till only their noses and staring china-blue eyes show above the surface, and then they lie like logs. The sun makes the rocks dance in the heat, and the herd {{children}} hear one kite (never any more) whistling almost out of sight overhead, and they know that if they died, or a cow died, that kite would sweep down, and the next kite miles away would see him drop and follow, and the next, and the next, and almost before they were dead there would be a score of hungry kites <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere.</b> Then they sleep and wake and sleep again, and weave little baskets of dried grass and put grasshoppers in them; or catch two praying mantises and make them fight; or string a necklace of red and black jungle nuts; or watch a lizard basking on a rock, or a snake hunting a frog near the wallows. Then they sing long, long songs with odd native quavers at the end of them, and the day seems longer than most people's whole lives, and perhaps they make a mud castle with mud figures of men and horses and buffaloes, and put reeds into the men's hands, and pretend that they are kings and the figures are their armies, or that they are gods to be worshiped. Then evening comes and the children call, and the buffaloes lumber up out of the sticky mud with noises like gunshots going off one after the other, and they all string across the gray plain back to the twinkling village lights.|$|E
