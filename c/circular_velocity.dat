These discrepancies appear due to very truncated gas distributions plus noncircular gas motions or gas motions not in the plane of the stellar disk, perhaps as the result of gravitational interactions.

50|$|Holochroal {{eyes had}} a great number (sometimes over 15,000) of small (30-100 μm, rarely larger) lenses. Lenses were hexagonally close packed, {{touching}} each other, with a single corneal membrane covering all lenses. Each lens was {{in direct contact with}} adjacent lenses. Holochroal eyes are the ancestral eye of trilobites, and are by far the most common, found in all orders except the Agnostida, and through the entirety of the Trilobites' existence. Little is known of the early history of holochroal eyes; Lower and Middle Cambrian trilobites rarely preserve the visual surface. The spatial resolving power of grated eyes (such as holochroal eyes) is dependent on light intensity, circular motion, receptor density, registered light angle, {{and the extent to which}} the signal of individual rhabdoms are neurally combined. This implies that lenses need to be larger under low light conditions (such as for Pricyclopyge, when comparing it to Carolinites), and for fast moving predators and prey. As the <b>circular</b> <b>velocity</b> caused by the forward speed of an animal itself is much higher for the ommatidia directed perpendicular to the movement, fast-moving trilobites (such as Carolinites) have eyes flattened from the side and more curved were ommatia are directed to the front or back.

5000|$|The R-bar {{approach}} {{consists of}} the chaser moving below or above the target spacecraft, along its radial vector. The motion is orthogonal to the orbital velocity of the passive spacecraft.When below the target the chaser fires radial thrusters to close in on the target. By this it increases its altitude. However, the orbital velocity of the chaser remains unchanged (thruster firings in the radial direction {{have no effect on}} the orbital velocity). Now in a slightly higher position, but with an orbital velocity that does not correspond to the local <b>circular</b> <b>velocity,</b> the chaser slightly falls behind the target. Small rocket pulses in the orbital velocity direction are necessary to keep the chaser along the radial vector of the target. If these rocket pulses are not executed (for example due to a thruster failure), the chaser will move away from the target. This is a natural braking effect. For the R-bar approach, this effect is stronger than for the V-bar approach, making the R-bar approach the safer one of the two.Generally, the R-bar approach from below is preferable, as the chaser is in a lower (faster) orbit than the target, and thus [...] "catches up" [...] with it. For the R-bar approach from above, the chaser is in a higher (slower) orbit than the target, and thus has to wait for the target to approach it.|$|E

If the CDM paradigm is correct, this prediction implies that the Milky Way and Andromeda are filled with numerous dark halos. To understand why these halos failed to form stars and become galaxies, we need to understand their history. We analyze the dynamical evolution of the substructure halos in a high-resolution cosmological simulation of Milky Way sized halos in the ΛCDM cosmology.
