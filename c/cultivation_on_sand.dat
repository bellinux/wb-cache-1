40|$|Moving {{about in}} nature often {{involves}} walking or {{running on a}} soft yielding substratum such as sand, which has {{a profound effect on}} the mechanics and energetics of locomotion. Force platform and cinematographic analyses were used to determine the mechanical work performed by human subjects during walking and running <b>on</b> <b>sand</b> and <b>on</b> a hard surface. Oxygen consumption was used to determine the energetic cost of walking and running under the same conditions. Walking <b>on</b> <b>sand</b> requires 1. 6 - 2. 5 times more mechanical work than does walking on a hard surface at the same speed. In contrast, running <b>on</b> <b>sand</b> requires only 1. 15 times more mechanical work than does running on a hard surface at the same speed. Walking <b>on</b> <b>sand</b> requires 2. 1 - 2. 7 times more energy expenditure than does walking on a hard surface at the same speed; while running <b>on</b> <b>sand</b> requires 1. 6 times more energy expenditure than does running on a hard surface. The increase in energy cost is due primarily to two effects: the mechanical work done <b>on</b> the <b>sand,</b> and a decrease in the efficiency of positive work done by the muscles and tendons...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of the cultivation time (spring-summer and autumn) {{and the kind of}} <b>cultivation</b> (<b>on</b> rockwool and peat) on the fertility of pollen coming from three successive trusses were studied for six different pepino clones. The fertility was defined in vitro as the capacity of pollen for germinating. The average capacity of pollen germination ranged in the studied clones from 10 to 15 %. These clones displayed the highest pollen fertility in an autumn cultivation, comparing to a spring-summer one. Higher rate of pollen fertility was observed during a spring-summer <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> first trusses in most of the clones studied. The pollen of all plants grown on rockwool was more fertile, comparing to the <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> peat substrate. High differences in pollen fertility of the clones were obtained.

30|$|The {{cellobiose}} lipid of Cryptococcus humicola, 16 -(tetra-O-acetyl-β-cellobiosyloxy)- 2 -hydroxyhexadecanoic acid, is {{a natural}} fungicide. Sensitivity of the cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to the fungicide depends on a carbon source. Cellobiose lipid concentrations inducing the leakage of potassium ions and ATP were similar for the cells grown in the medium with glucose and ethanol. However, the cells grown on glucose and ethanol died at 0.05 mg ml- 1 and 0.2 mg ml- 1 cellobiose lipid, respectively. Inorganic polyphosphate (PolyP) synthesis was 65 % of the control with 0.05 mg ml- 1 cellobiose lipid during <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> ethanol. PolyP synthesis was not observed during the <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> glucose at the same cellobiose lipid concentration. The content of longer-chain polyP was higher during <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> ethanol. We speculate the long-chained polyP participate in the viability restoring of ethanol-grown cells after treatment with the cellobiose lipid.|$|R
