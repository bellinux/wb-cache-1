5|$|Following a {{fuel stop}} at Nicosia International Airport, the pilots {{were forced to}} fly towards Munich-Riem Airport, where the hijackers {{initially}} had intended the exchange to take place. When the aircraft had arrived in Austrian airspace at around noon and it became evident that their demands could not be fulfilled in time, this plan was changed, and the Lufthansa crew had to divert instead to Zagreb {{in what was then}} the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, <b>circling</b> <b>over</b> Zagreb Airport until the Black September members had been brought there. This put the Germans under a pressure of time, as the aircraft would eventually run out of fuel.|$|E
5|$|As {{the date}} of the {{operation}} approached, training became more intensive. Glider units spent hours aloft every day <b>circling</b> <b>over</b> airfields as they practiced the manoeuvers required to land the airborne forces next to the bridges over the Orne River, the Caen canal, the Dives, and the Merville battery. Once the pilots had practiced this sufficiently during the day, they were then switched to night operations. In the landing grounds used by the division for their operations, dozens of poles similar to those in Normandy were erected, with engineering units then timed on how fast they could demolish the obstacles. The battalion assigned to neutralising Merville spent two weeks at a special camp, where they built a replica of the battery and carried out several rehearsal exercises in and around it. The force assigned to the coup-de-main operation, to capture the bridges over the Orne River and Caen canal, were transferred to Exeter. There, they conducted intensive exercises around the River Exe and the nearby canal that stood in place for their real objective. The pilots of the gliders and transport aircraft were also constantly briefed with thousands of maps and photographs of the landing zones and the surrounding areas, as well as dozens of scale models of the zones and the primary objectives, such as the bridges and the Merville battery. A coloured film was produced from aerial reconnaissance photographs which, when played at the correct speed and height over the scale models, realistically simulated the paths the glider pilots would take towards their landing-zones.|$|E

Hawks flew his Standard J-1 World War I trainer carrying wing-walker Wesley May aloft to join up with Daugherty, <b>circling</b> <b>over</b> Long Beach, California. May, carrying a five-gallon can of gasoline, stepped over to Earl’s ship and poured the gas in the Jenny’s tank.|$|E

25|$|Airport {{proposals}} were defeated in two hotly contested ballot initiatives, and further challenges {{took place in}} the courts. A series of demonstration commercial flights from the airport in June 1999 generated less noise than the former military flights, but resulted in much public outcry due to the use of different flight paths from the military, and incessant <b>circling</b> <b>over</b> nearby cities to line up for another approach. Eventually the airport opponents prevailed, and in March 2002, the Department of Defense announced that it would sell the land to private interests to be developed into Orange County Great Park. This decision came right after the military stated that it wanted to return to the base.|$|E
25|$|While {{returning}} to Germany from Brazil in October 1933, the Graf Zeppelin stopped at Miami (NAS Opa Locka) {{and then in}} Akron, Ohio where it visited the Goodyear-Zeppelin Company's massive airdock before proceeding to the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago. After <b>circling</b> <b>over</b> the fair and landing for a brief 25-minute visit there, the Graf then returned to Akron for two days before leaving for Friedrichshafen with an overnight stop in Sevilla, Spain. The United States Post Office Department issued a special 50-cent airmail stamp (C-18) to commemorate the visit. Many of these stamps were used to frank souvenir mail carried on the Graf on its return flight to Germany. The visit was also to be the fifth and final one that the LZ 127 would make to the United States.|$|E
25|$|While {{on a tour}} of the United States, Caldwell visited Curtiss-Wright in Buffalo, New York. On August 6, 1942, he {{was invited}} to come on an {{acceptance}} re-flight of a Curtiss C-46 Commando, the latest transport aircraft destined for overseas use. The aircraft was also loaded with Curtiss executives, and flown by Chief Production Test Pilot Herbert O. Fisher. The landing gear became stuck in a three-quarters down position, and after an extended eight-hour attempt to release the gear, Fisher calmly belly-landed the C-46. With the weight of the aircraft gently pushing the gear back into the wheel wells, a minimum of damage resulted. Caldwell had taken over as the co-pilot on the eight hours of <b>circling</b> <b>over</b> Buffalo, receiving certification that he was checked out on the C-46, under the tutelage of Fisher. Finishing his tour at Curtiss-Wright, Caldwell went on to visit the North American Aviation factory and was able to personally evaluate their new P-51 fighter, then in development.|$|E

The Almelund Shale is a lithologically uniform unit of dark-grey to black shales with rare carbonate interbeds between the Komstad Limestone and the Sularp Shale.

2500|$|Animism {{entails the}} belief that [...] "all living things have a soul", and thus a central concern of animist thought {{surrounds}} how animals can be eaten or otherwise used for humans' subsistence needs. The actions of non-human animals are viewed as [...] "intentional, planned and purposive", and they are understood to be persons because they are both alive and communicate with others. In animist world-views, non-human animals are understood to participate in kinship systems and ceremonies with humans, as well as having their own kinship systems and ceremonies. Harvey cited {{an example of an}} animist understanding of animal behaviour that occurred at a powwow held by the Conne River Mi'kmaq in 1996; an eagle flew over the proceedings, <b>circling</b> <b>over</b> the central drum group. The assembled participants called out kitpu ("eagle"), conveying welcome to the bird and expressing pleasure at its beauty, and they later articulated the view that the eagle's actions reflected its approval of the event and the Mi'kmaq's return to traditional spiritual practices.|$|E
2500|$|Russian {{military}} jets {{flew over}} South Ossetia on 8 July 2008. On 9 July, the deputy commander of Georgia's air force, Colonel Zurab Pochkua said: [...] "For almost 40 minutes, four Russian planes were <b>circling</b> <b>over</b> the territory north of Tskhinvali." [...] In turn Russia accused Georgia of [...] "a serious breach" [...] {{of the flight}} ban, with a spokesman for Russian peacekeepers in South Ossetia saying two Georgian Su-25 fighter jets flew over the region. On 10 July, the Russian authorities confirmed the flight and said, in an official statement, the fighters were sent to [...] "let hot heads in Tbilisi cool down." [...] This was Russia's first admission in a decade that its air force had flown over Georgian territory without permission. Moscow had always denied earlier overflights. The Russian overflight was ordered less than 24 hours before the U.S. Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, was due to arrive in Georgia. In response, Georgia recalled its ambassador to Moscow [...] "for consultations", stating that it was [...] "outraged by Russia's aggressive policies." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tisquesusa was thrusted by {{the sword}} of one of De Quesada's {{soldiers}} but without knowing he was the zipa he let him go, after taking the expensive mantle of the ruler. Tisquesusa fled hurt into the mountains past Facatativá, in {{the west of the}} Bogotá savanna, and died of his wounds there. His body was only discovered a year later because of the black vultures <b>circling</b> <b>over</b> it. Upon the death of Tisquesusa, his son Hama and daughter Machinza hid the sister of the zipa, Usaca, in one of the settlements on the Bogotá savanna. When one of the conquistadors, Juan María Cortés, found out about this, his prepared a battle to gain control over the area. At that moment, Usaca appeared and resisted against the Spanish conqueror. Legend tells that he dropped his weapons {{and fell in love with}} her, eventually marrying the sister of Tisquesusa and they were baptised in Usaquén, meaning [...] "Land of the Sun" [...] in Muysccubun. This formed the start of the construction of a colonial village, today part of the capital and known for its colonial architecture and parks.|$|E

60|$|Jack was right. I {{observed}} {{a very fine}} fish-hawk <b>circling</b> <b>over</b> {{the head of one}} of the pelicans. Its head and neck were white, and its body was of a reddish chocolate colour. Just as we came in sight, the pelican caught a fine fish, which it stowed away safe in the pouch under its chin. The sly hawk, which had been watching for this, immediately made a descent towards its victim, making a considerable noise with its wings as it came down. Hearing this, the pelican looked hastily up, and supposing that a terrible and deadly assault was about to be made, opened its mouth and screamed in terror. This was just what the hawk wanted. The open bill revealed the fish in the pouch. Down he swooped, snatched it out, and then soared away with his ill-gotten gains in his talons.|$|E
60|$|The {{days were}} getting shorter now; it {{was little more}} than eight o'clock and already the shades of evening were drawing closely in: the last rays of the setting sun had long {{disappeared}} in a glowing haze of gold, and the fantastic branches of the old elms, intertwined with the parasitic ivy looked grim and threatening, silhouetted against the lurid after glow. Master Busy liked neither the solitude, nor yet the silence of the woods; he had just caught sight of a bat <b>circling</b> <b>over</b> the dilapidated roof of the pavilion, and he hated bats. Though he belonged to a community which denied the angels and ignored the saints, he had a firm belief in the existence of a tangible devil, and somehow he could not dissociate his ideas of hell and of evil spirits from those which related to the mysterious flutterings of bats.|$|E

60|$|A great {{crowd was}} {{assembled}} in the market-place, waiting for the hour when an eagle should be let loose from a cage, for it had been settled that on whose-soever house the eagle alighted, the owner of that house should become ruler of the town. At last the hour arrived; the eagle was set free, and all eyes were strained to see where it would alight. But <b>circling</b> <b>over</b> {{the heads of the}} crowd, it flew straight {{in the direction of a}} young man, who was at that moment entering the town. This was none other than Bobino, who had awakened soon after his companions had left him, and had followed in their footsteps. All the people shouted and proclaimed that he was their future ruler, and he was conducted by a great crowd to the Governor's house, which was for the future to be his home. And here he lived happily, and ruled wisely over the people.|$|E
60|$|The late walker or sailor, in the October evenings, {{may hear}} the murmurings of the snipe, <b>circling</b> <b>over</b> the meadows, the most spirit-like sound in nature; and still {{later in the}} autumn, when the frosts have tinged the leaves, a solitary loon pays a visit to our retired ponds, where he may lurk {{undisturbed}} till the season of moulting is passed, making the woods ring with his wild laughter. This bird, the Great Northern Diver, well deserves its name; for when pursued with a boat, it will dive, and swim like a fish under water, for sixty rods or more, {{as fast as a}} boat can be paddled, and its pursuer, if he would discover his game again, must put his ear to the surface to hear where it comes up. When it comes to the surface, it throws the water off with one shake of its wings, and calmly swims about until again disturbed.|$|E
60|$|When a big hawk came near, or when, on dark afternoons, a young owl took {{to hunting}} in the neighborhood, the jays sounded the alarm, and the fishhawks swept up from the lake on the instant.

But they never attacked the feathered robbers, as they had done with the fisher, and, so far as I could see, there was no need.
