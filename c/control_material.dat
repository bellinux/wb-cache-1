50|$|Laboratory {{quality control}} is {{designed}} to detect, reduce, and correct deficiencies in a laboratory's internal analytical process prior {{to the release of}} patient results, in order {{to improve the quality of}} the results reported by the laboratory. Quality control is a measure of precision, or how well the measurement system reproduces the same result over time and under varying operating conditions. Laboratory quality <b>control</b> <b>material</b> is usually run at the beginning of each shift, after an instrument is serviced, when reagent lots are changed, after calibration, and whenever patient results seem inappropriate. Quality <b>control</b> <b>material</b> should approximate the same matrix as patient specimens, taking into account properties such as viscosity, turbidity, composition, and color. It should be simple to use, with minimal vial to vial variability, because variability could be misinterpreted as systematic error in the method or instrument. It should be stable for long periods of time, and available in large enough quantities for a single batch to last at least one year. Liquid controls are more convenient than lyophilized controls because they do not have to be reconstituted minimizing pipetting error.|$|E
50|$|Positioning (withdrawing or inserting) {{control rods}} is the normal method for {{controlling}} power when starting up a BWR. As control rods are withdrawn, neutron absorption decreases in the <b>control</b> <b>material</b> {{and increases in}} the fuel, so reactor power increases. As control rods are inserted, neutron absorption increases in the <b>control</b> <b>material</b> and decreases in the fuel, so reactor power decreases. Differently from the PWR, in a BWR the control rods (boron carbide plates) are inserted from below to give a more homogeneous distribution of the power: in the upper side {{the density of the}} water is lower due to vapour formation, making the neutron moderation less efficient and the fission probability lower. In normal operation, the control rods are only used to keep a homogeneous power distribution in the reactor and compensate the consumption of the fuel, while the power is controlled through the water flow (see below). Some early BWRs and the proposed ESBWR (Economic Simplified BWR made by General Electric Hitachi) designs use only natural circulation with control rod positioning to control power from zero to 100% because they do not have reactor recirculation systems.|$|E
