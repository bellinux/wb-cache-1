40|$|The Multidrug Resistance Protein MRP 1 (ABCC 1) can confer {{resistance}} {{to a variety}} of therapeutic drugs. In addition, MRP 1 /ABCC 1 mediates cellular export of natural folates, such as folic acid and l-leucovorin. In this study we determined whether <b>cellular</b> <b>folate</b> status affected the functional activity of MRP 1 /ABCC 1 mediated efflux of an established substrate, the anthracycline daunorubicin (DNR). As a model system we used the human ovarian carcinoma cell line 2008 wt, and its MRP 1 /ABCC 1 transfected subline 2008 /MRP 1. Both types of these moderate- and high-MRP 1 /ABCC 1 expressing cells displayed efflux of DNR when maintained in standard culture media (2. 3 microM folic acid). The initial total cellular DNR efflux rate in 2008 /MRP 1 cells was approximately 2 -fold higher compared to 2008 wt cells. This efflux consisted of MRP 1 /ABCC 1 mediated transport, possibly non-MRP 1 mediated transport, as well as passive diffusion. Benzbromarone, a specific MRP 1 inhibitor, decreased the initial efflux rate in 2008 /MRP 1 cells (4 -fold) and in 2008 wt cells (2 -fold). When 2008 /MRP 1 cells were challenged for 2 days in folate-free medium, total cellular DNR efflux was decreased to 43 % of the initial efflux rate under folate-rich conditions. In 2008 wt cells DNR efflux was decreased to 84 % of the folate-rich conditions. Benzbromarone did not inhibit DNR efflux after the folate-free period in both cell lines. Repletion of folate by a 2 - 24 hr exposure to 2. 5 microM l-leucovorin or folic acid resulted in a complete restoration of DNR efflux. In contrast, expression of MRP 1 /ABCC 1 protein was not changed significantly during the folate-free period or the repletion-period, nor were cellular ATP or ADP pools. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the <b>cellular</b> <b>folate</b> status can influence the transport activity of MRP 1 /ABCC 1. These results have potentially important implications in the understanding of the (patho-) physiological roles of MRP 1 /ABCC 1, and possibly other ABC transporter proteins in <b>cellular</b> <b>folate</b> homeostasis and drug resistance...|$|E
40|$|Cobalamin-dependent {{methionine}} synthase catalyzes {{the transfer}} of a methyl group from N 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine, producing tetrahydrofolate and methionine. Insufficient availability of cobalamin, or inhibition of methionine synthase by exposure to nitrous oxide, leads to diminished activity of this enzyme. In humans, severe inhibition of methionine synthase results {{in the development of}} megaloblastic anemia, and eventually in subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. It also results in diminished intracellular folate levels and a redistribution of folate derivatives. In this review, we summarize recent progress in understanding the catalysis and regulation of this important enzyme from both bacterial and mammalian sources. Because inhibition of mammalian methionine synthase can restrict the incorporation of methyltetrahydrofolate from the blood into <b>cellular</b> <b>folate</b> pools {{that can be used for}} nucleotide biosynthesis, it is a potential chemotherapeutic target. The review emphasizes the mechanistic information that will be needed in order to design rational inhibitors of the enzyme. -BANERJEE, R. V.; MATTHEWS, R. G.

40|$|Folate metabolism, {{which is}} {{responsible}} for one-carbon transfer reactions in critical cellular processes including thymidine biosynthesis, is among the most important targets of antibiotic and anticancer drugs. Analysis of intracellular folates is complicated by three different types of folate modification: oxidation/reduction, methylation, and polyglutamylation. Here we present a method for quantifying the full diversity of intracellular folates by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The method begins with folate extraction using − 75 °C methanol:water, with ascorbic acid and ammonium acetate added to prevent folate interconversion. The extract is then separated using hydrophilic interaction chromatography with an amino column, ionized by positive mode electrospray, and analyzed on a triple quadrupole instrument using multiple reaction monitoring. The method has been used to profile the folate pools in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with absolute levels of selected folates in E. coli measured by spiking extracts of cells fed uniformly 13 C-glucose with purified, unlabeled folate standards. An isotope-ratio-based approach has been applied to study the effects of trimethoprim, a clinically important antibiotic that blocks bacterial dihydrofolate reductase. In addition to causing the expected increase in oxidized and decrease in reduced folates, trimethoprim triggered a dramatic and previously unrecognized shift towards shorter polyglutamate chain lengths. This finding highlights the potential for analysis of the full spectrum of <b>cellular</b> <b>folates</b> by MS/MS to unveil novel biological phenomena...|$|R
40|$|Folates are {{essential}} nutrients {{that are required}} for one-carbon biosynthetic and epigenetic processes. A deficiency in <b>cellular</b> <b>folates</b> results in aberrant DNA methylation, point mutations, chromosome breakage, defective chromosome recombination and aneuploidy. In 1999 {{it was first reported}} that impairments in folate/homocysteine metabolism, due to genetic polymorphisms of metabolic enzymes, could increase the risk for having an infant with Down syndrome (DS). That paper stimulated considerable investigation into the possible role of folate/homocysteine metabolism in the risk of having a DS child and several studies have been performed so far in different countries to better address this issue. However, despite 10 years of active research, the question is still unsolved. Overall, both in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that an impaired folate/homocysteine metabolism can result in chromosome 21 nondisjunction; however, the birth of a DS child seems {{to be the result of}} the interplay of several factors of genetic, epigenetic, environmental, and stochastic origin, making it difficult to discriminate the single contribution of each of them. My opinion is that it is now time for the design of a collaborative study large enough to have the power to separate trisomy 21 into all its component parts and to test for the contribution of folate/homocysteine gene polymorphisms to each of them. This study should be paralleled by in vitro and in vivo studies aimed at clarifying the contribution, if any, of folate/homocysteine metabolism to the methylation pattern of regions involved in recombination and segregation of chromosome 21. Further studies are also required to address the possible contribution of both the paternal diet and the maternal grandmother dietary habits to chromosome 21 nondisjunction events...|$|R

40|$|The low-density {{lipoprotein}} (LDL) receptor-related protein 2 (LRP 2) is a multifunctional cell surface receptor {{expressed in the}} embryonic neuroepithelium. Loss of LRP 2 in the developing murine central nervous system (CNS) causes impaired closure of the rostral neural tube at embryonic stage (E) 9. 0. Similar neural tube defects (NTDs) have previously been attributed to impaired folate metabolism in mice. We therefore asked whether LRP 2 might be required for delivery of folate to neuroepithelial cells during neurulation. Uptake assays in whole embryo cultures showed that LRP 2 deficient neuroepithelial cells are unable to mediate uptake of folate bound to soluble folate receptor 1 (sFOLR 1). Consequently, folate concentrations are significantly reduced in Lrp 2 -/- embryos compared to control littermates. Moreover, the folic acid dependent gene Alx 3 is significantly down regulated in Lrp 2 mutants. In conclusion, we show that LRP 2 is essential for <b>cellular</b> <b>folate</b> uptake in the developing neural tube, a crucial step for proper neural tube closure...|$|E
40|$|Breast cancer {{resistance}} protein (BCRP/ABCG 2) {{is currently}} the only ABC transporter that exports mono- and polyglutamates of folates and methotrexate (MTX). Here we explored the relationship between <b>cellular</b> <b>folate</b> status and BCRP expression. Toward this end, MCF- 7 breast cancer cells, with low BCRP and moderate multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP 1 /ABCC 1) levels, and their mitoxantrone (MR) -resistant MCF- 7 /MR subline, with BCRP overexpression and low MRP 1 levels, were gradually deprived of folic acid from 2. 3 microm to 3 nm resulting in the sublines MCF- 7 /LF and MCF- 7 /MR-LF. These cell lines expressed only residual BCRP mRNA and protein levels and retained a poor MRP 2 (ABCC 2) through MRP 5 (ABCC 5) expression. Furthermore, MCF- 7 /MR-LF cells also displayed 5 -fold decreased MRP 1 levels relative to MCF- 7 /MR cells. In contrast, BCRP overexpression was largely retained in MCF- 7 /MR cells grown in MR-free medium containing 2. 3 microm folic acid. Loss of BCRP expression in MCF- 7 /LF and MCF- 7 /MR-LF cells resulted in the following: (a) a prominent decrease in the efflux of Hoechst 33342, a BCRP substrate; (b) an approximately 2 -fold increase in MR accumulation as revealed by flow cytometry; this {{was accompanied by a}} 2. 5 - and approximately 84 -fold increased MR sensitivity in these cell lines, respectively. Consistently, Ko 143, a specific BCRP inhibitor, rendered MCF- 7 and MCF- 7 /MR cells 2. 1 - and approximately 16. 4 -fold more sensitive to MR, respectively. Loss of BCRP expression also resulted in the following: (c) an identical MTX sensitivity in these cell lines thereby losing the approximately 28 -fold MTX resistance of the MCF- 7 /MR cells; (d) an approximately 2 -fold increase in the 4 - and 24 -h accumulation of [(3) H]folic acid. Furthermore, MCF- 7 /MR-LF cells displayed a significant increase in folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase activity. Hence, consistent with the mono- and polyglutamate folate exporter function of BCRP, down-regulation of BCRP and increased folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase activity appear to be crucial components of cellular adaptation to folate deficiency conditions. This is the first evidence for the possible role of BCRP in the maintenance of <b>cellular</b> <b>folate</b> homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{molecular}} {{basis of the}} up to 46 -fold increased accumulation of folates and methotrexate (MTX) in human leukemia CEM- 7 A cells established by gradual deprivation of leucovorin (LCV). CEM- 7 A cells consequently exhibited 10 - and 68 -fold decreased LCV and folic acid growth requirements and 23 - 25 -fold hypersensitivity to MTX and edatrexate. Although CEM- 7 A cells displayed a 74 - 86 -fold increase in the reduced folate carrier (RFC) -mediated influx of LCV and MTX, RFC overexpression per se cannot induce a prominently increased folate/MTX accumulation because RFC functions as a nonconcentrative anion exchanger. We therefore explored the possibility that folate efflux activity mediated {{by members of the}} multidrug resistance protein (MRP) family was impaired in CEM- 7 A cells. Parental CEM cells expressed substantial levels of MRP 1, MRP 4, poor MRP 5 levels, whereas MRP 2, MRP 3 and breast cancer resistance protein were undetectable. In contrast, CEM- 7 A cells lost 95 % of MRP 1 levels while retaining parental expression of MRP 4 and MRP 5. Consequently, CEM- 7 A cells displayed a 5 -fold decrease in the [(3) H]folic acid efflux rate constant, which was identical to that obtained with parental CEM cells, when their folic acid efflux was blocked (78 %) with probenecid. Furthermore, when compared with parental CEM, CEM- 7 A cells accumulated 2 -fold more calcein fluorescence. Treatment of parental cells with the MRP 1 efflux inhibitors MK 571 and probenecid resulted in a 60 - 100 % increase in calcein fluorescence. In contrast, these inhibitors failed to alter the calcein fluorescence in CEM- 7 A cells, which markedly lost MRP 1 expression. Replenishment of LCV in the growth medium of CEM- 7 A cells resulted in resumption of normal MRP 1 expression. These results establish {{for the first time that}} MRP 1 is the primary folate efflux route in CEM leukemia cells and that the loss of folate efflux activity is an efficient means of markedly augmenting <b>cellular</b> <b>folate</b> pools. These findings suggest a functional role for MRP 1 in the maintenance of <b>cellular</b> <b>folate</b> homeostasis...|$|E

40|$|The folate {{cycle and}} disease in humans. The {{prevalence}} of hyperhomocysteinemia in renal disease patients, its treatment by folate administration, and its aggravation by the 677 C→T mutation of methylene-tetrahydrofolate (methylene-THF) reductase has established the folate cycle {{as an important}} factor in the pathogenesis and management of renal disease. Proper function of the folate cycle depends on normal function of involved enzymes adequate of the vitamin and its correct disposition within the body. Vital processes in folate disposition include conversion of dietary folylpolyglutamates to monoglutamates, intestinal absorption, receptor and carrier-mediated transport across cell membranes, and <b>cellular</b> export. <b>Folate</b> coenzymes are responsible for the one-carbon unit transfer in intermediary metabolism and are required for several reactions in key metabolic processes, for example of purine, pyrimidine and methionine synthesis, and glycine and serine metabolism. Methionine synthase and its recently discovered reducing protein as well as methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase are key folate enzymes in homocysteine metabolism. Deficiencies of these enzymes are important causes of severe disease in the rare remethylation defects causing homocystinuria. Knowledge of their catalytic and molecular properties is important in understanding possible causes of moderate hyperhomocysteinemia, as for example, the well-known 677 C→T transition of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase...|$|R

Folate deficiency impairs DNA synthesis, induces cancer, and causes abnormalities such as neural tube defects and megaloblastic anemia. While scientific research has established the effects of folate deficiency on serum folate, a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of folate deficiency in tissues and cells has yet to be conducted. Using molecular techniques to determine gene expression and a microbiological assay to determine the folate level, we elucidated the mechanism of folate tissue status in response to folate depletion. Our study showed that dietary folate deficiency had an impact on serum folate as well as tissue folate status.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{several aspects of}} the effects of {{cobalamin}} inactivation by nitrous oxide on <b>cellular</b> <b>folate</b> metabolism and the consequences on normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Kroes et al. demonstrated the antileukemic effects of nitrous oxide either or not in combination with other drugs interfering with the folate metabolism (132 - 136). Especially the potentiation of methotrexate activity in the employed rat model for myeloid leukemia (BNML) after preexposure to nitrous oxide was striking (134). Based on those findings part of the work presented in this thesis focuses on the in vivo interaction between nitrous oxide and methotrexate. In order to establish the cytotoxicity of the nitrous oxide-methotrexate combination for normal cells, we conducted an extensive toxicological study in healthy rats in which we concentrated on the effects on the rapidly dividing cells of bone marrow and gut mucosa (Chapter 3). Moreover, effects of nitrous oxide and/ or methotrexate on folate metabolism and folate-depedent dTMP synthesis of fresh human leukemic cells were studied in order to clarify the actual working mechanism (Chapter 4, 5) ...|$|E

Previous epidemiological studies reported a potential protective effect of MTHFR 677 C -> T against acute lymphocytic leukemia and malignant lymphoma, but the mechanism {{remains to be}} determined. We investigated the biochemical impacts of MTHFR 677 C -> T on cellular S-adenosyl methionine (adoMet) synthesis, global DNA methylation, and de novo purine synthesis, {{all of which are}} potential regulatory pathways involved in tumorigenesis. Metabolic fluxes of homocysteine remethylation and de novo purine synthesis were compared between Epstein - Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts expressing MTHFR 677 C and MTHFR 677 T using stable isotopic tracers and GCMS. MTHFR TT genotype significantly reduced folate-dependent remethylation under folate restriction, reflecting limited methylated folates under folate restriction. Data also suggested increased formylated folate pool and increased purine synthesis when folate is adequate. The impacts of MTHFR 677 T polymorphism appeared closely related to folate status, and such alterations may modulate metabolic pathways involved in cancer onset/ progression. The advantage of de novo purine synthesis found in the MTHFR TT genotype may account for the protective effect of MTHFR in hematological malignancies. These transformed cells are potential models for studying the consequences of human genetic variation and cancer pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|The data {{presented}} in this research is central to establishing {{the role that the}} base excision repair pathway (BER) plays in the development and progression of colon cancer when dietary folate is deficient. Both <b>cellular</b> <b>folate</b> restriction and BER deficiencies have been shown to result in the accumulation of endogenous damage and lesions that could eventually develop into carcinogenesis. In this study, a dietary folate deficiency (FD) resulted in a significant increase in aberrant crypt foci (ACF) formation and triggered liver tumorogenesis in wildtype (WT) animals, as did a BER deficiency in DNA polymerase Β haploinsufficient (Β-pol+/-) mice exposed to 1, 2 -dimethylhydrazine (DMH), a known colon and liver carcinogen. We combined both folate restriction and a BER deficiency to determine the fate of colon tissue after exposure to DMH. Of interest, we show that this model supports a protection against colon carcinogenesis. FD attenuated onset and progression of ACF and prevented liver tumorigenesis in Β-pol haploinsufficient mice. Analysis of the data suggests that the mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs appears to be through an elevation in DNA damage that signals recruitment of PARP enzymes to the site of damage, however, with a deficiency in BER, PARP function in DNA repair is futile leading to a depletion of cellular energetic levels. This energetic stress is sensed by cell death machinery and as such apoptosis is invoked...|$|E
40|$|Inhalation {{therapy with}} small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a {{promising}} {{approach in the}} treatment of pulmonary disorders. However, clinical translation is severely limited by the lack of suitable delivery platforms. In this study, we aim to address this limitation by designing a novel bioinspired hybrid nanoparticle with a core-shell nanoarchitecture, consisting of a siRNA-loaded dextran nanogel (siNG) core and a pulmonary surfactant (Curosurf (R)) outer shell. The decoration of siNGs with a surfactant shell enhances the colloidal stability and prevents siRNA release in the presence of competing polyanions, which are abundantly present in biofluids. Additionally, the impact of the surfactant shell on the biological efficacy of the siNGs is determined in lung cancer cells. The presence of the surfactants substantially reduces the cellular uptake of siNGs. Remarkably, the lowered intracellular dose does not impede the gene silencing effect, suggesting a crucial role of the pulmonary surfactant in the intracellular processing of the nanoparticles. In order to surmount the observed reduction in <b>cellular</b> dose, <b>folate</b> is incorporated as a targeting ligand in the pulmonary surfactant shell to incite receptor-mediated endocytosis. The latter substantially enhances both cellular uptake and gene silencing potential, achieving efficient knockdown at siRNA concentrations in the low nanomolar range. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Background: Although single {{nucleotide}} polymorphisms may be potentially important pharmacogenetic determinants of cancer therapy, functional evidence regarding their relevance is currently lacking. The C 677 T polymorphism in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene is associated with changes in <b>cellular</b> composition of <b>folates.</b> We hypothesized that this polymorphism may modulate the cytotoxic effect of 5 -fluorouracil (5 FU) and methotrexate (MTX), two commonly used chemotherapeutic agents for colon and breast cancers, because the modes of action of 5 FU and MTX are critically dependent on <b>cellular</b> composition of <b>folates.</b> Methods: Human HCT 116 colon and MDA-MB- 435 breast cancer cells were stably transfected with wild-type or mutant 677 T human MTHFR cDNA. MTHFR enzyme activity and thermolability, intracellular folate composition, growth rate, and catalytic thymidylate synthase activity were determined. In vitro chemosensitivity to 5 FU and MTX was determined using the sulforhodamine B assay. In vivo chemosensitivity of HCT 116 cells to 5 FU was determined in nude mice. Results: Compared with cells expressing the wild-type MTHFR, HCT 116 and MDA-MB- 435 cells expressing the mutant 677 T MTHFR had decreased MTHFR activity, MTHFR thermolability, changed intracellular <b>folate</b> distribution, accelerated <b>cellular</b> growth rate, and increased thymidylate synthase activity. The MTHFR 677 T mutation increased chemosensitivity of colon and breast cancers to 5 FU, but decreased chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells to MTX. In nude mice, xenografts expressing the mutant 677 T MTHFR grew faster, but were more sensitive to 5 FU, than xenografts expressing the wild-type protein. Conclusions: Our data provide evidence that the MTHFR C 677 T polymorphism affects the concentration and intracellular distribution of folates and changes the growth and chemosensitivity of colon and breast cancer cells. The MTHFR C 677 T polymorphism may be a useful pharmacogenetic determinant for providing rational and effective tailored chemotherapy...|$|R
30|$|Folate {{molecules}} {{exist in}} vivo mainly as polyglutamates {{which are the}} preferred form by most folate-dependent enzymes (Shane, 1989). Indeed, polyglutamylated 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate {{is required for the}} largest plant C 1 anabolic flux, which converts homocysteine to methionine (Hanson and Roje, 2001; Ravanel et al. 2004). In addition, the glycine–serine interconversion, which links the metabolism of one-, two- and three-carbon compounds, is another sink for the polyglutamylated folates (Bauwe and Kolukisaoglu, 2003, Besson et al. 1993). These glutamate-extended folate molecules are produced by folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS, EC 6.3. 2.17). This enzyme is responsible for sequentially conjugating L-glutamic acid residues with monoglutamate folate via γ-carboxyl peptide linkages (Suh et al., 2001). Studies of folate polyglutamylation in yeast and mammalian systems have shown that this post-biosynthetic processing protects this molecule from oxidative breakdown by protein binding (Suh et al. 2001, Jones and Nixon 2002), which is favoured by polyglutamylation resulting in folate stability. Furthermore, protein binding aids the protection of deglutamylation of polyglutamyl folates γ-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH; Wang et al. 1993). Hence, these mechanisms could retain <b>cellular</b> polyglutamylated <b>folate</b> forms for the demand of cells. In plants, the degree of glutamylation varies between organs (Lowe et al. 1993). Tetra- and pentaglutamylated folate forms are reported predominant in pea leaves (Imeson et al. 1990); whereas diglutamylated folate is predominant in carrot root (Cossins and Chen 1997).|$|R

We particularly investigate whether inactive truncated TrxR is present under selenium-starvation conditions due to reading of the UGA codon as stop. Feeding rats a selenium-deficient diet resulted in a large decrease in activity of TrxR and GPx in rat liver but not in the levels of Trx 1 and Grx 1. However, selenium deficiency induced mitochondrial Grx 2 10 -fold and markedly changed the expression of some flavoproteins that are involved in the <b>cellular</b> <b>folate,</b> glucose, and lipid metabolism. Liver TrxR mRNA was nearly unchanged, but no truncated enzyme was found. Instead, a low-activity form of TrxR with a cysteine substituted for the penultimate selenocysteine in the C-terminal active site was identified in selenium-deficient rat liver. These results show a novel mechanism for decoding the UGA stop codon, inserting cysteine to make a full-length enzyme that may be required for selenium assimilation. —Lu, J., Zhong, L., Lönn, M.

40|$|Haematological sequellae {{of vitamin}} B 12 {{deficiency}} {{are attributed to}} disturbed DNA synthesis, but vitamin B 12 itself plays no role in DNA biosynthesis. A proposed explanation {{for this is the}} methylfolate trap hypothesis. This hypothesis states that B 12 deficiency impairs overall folate metabolism because 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate (5 MTHF) becomes metabolically trapped. This trap results from the fact that 5 MTHF can neither be metabolised via the methionine synthase pathway, nor can it be reconverted to its precursor, methylenetetrahydrofolate. Other manifestations of the methylfolate trap include <b>cellular</b> <b>folate</b> loss because of shorter 5 MTHF polyglutamate chains and global hypomethylation. The methylfolate trap has never been demonstrated in humans. We describe a patient with B 12 deficiency who was homozygous for the common methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C 677 T mutation. We analysed red blood cell (RBC) folate vitamers and global DNA methylation by liquid chromatography (LC) in combination with tandem mass spectrometry, and 5 MTHF polyglutamate length by LC-electrochemical detection. Compared to post-B 12 supplementation values, homocysteine was higher (52. 9 micromol/l vs. 16. 8 micromol/l), RBC folate was lower (268. 92 nmol/l vs. 501. 2 nmol/l), the 5 MTHF fraction of RBC folate was much higher (94. 5 % vs. 67. 4 %), polyglutamate chain length was shorter (more tetra- and pentaglutamates), and global DNA methylation was 22 % lower.

In addition to the expected increases in methylmalonate and homocysteine (Hcy), we observed an approximately sevenfold increase in formate levels, from 64 ?M in control rats to 402 ?M in vitamin B(12) -deficient rats. Urinary formate was also elevated. This elevation of formate {{could be attributed to}} impaired one-carbon metabolism since formate is assimilated into the one-carbon pool by incorporation into 10 -formyl-THF via the enzyme 10 -formyl-THF synthase. Both plasma and urinary formate were also increased in folate-deficient rats. Hcy was elevated in both the vitamin B(12) - and folate-deficient rats. Although plasma Hcy was also elevated, plasma formate was unaffected in vitamin B(6) -deficient rats (impaired transsulfuration pathway). These results were in accord with a mathematical model of folate metabolism, which predicted that reduction in methionine synthase activity would cause increased formate levels, whereas reduced cystathionine ?-synthase activity would not. Our data indicate that formate provides a novel window into <b>cellular</b> <b>folate</b> metabolism, that elevated formate can be a useful indicator of deranged one-carbon metabolism and can be used to discriminate between the hyperhomocysteinemia caused by defects in the remethylation and transsulfuration pathway...|$|E
40|$|Folate is a {{water-soluble}} vitamin B {{that plays}} a critical co-enzyme in the de novo nucleotide synthesis and other biochemical processes including DNA metabolism, DNA repair, DNA methylation, and <b>cellular</b> growth. <b>Folate</b> deficiency {{has been associated}} to {{increase the risk of}} neural tube defects (NTDs) and cancers of the lung, breast, colon, cervix, esposphagus and brain. Most importantly, folate deficiency has been shown to increase uracil misincorporation into DNA and therefore induce DNA damage repaired by the base excision repair (BER) pathway. In response to folate depletion, levels of thmidylate decrease in the deoxyribonucelotide pool, resulting in uracil being misincorporation into DNA instead of thymine during replication and repair. Uracil misincorporation into DNA {{is believed to be the}} biological mechanism of how folate affects carcinogenesis. We evaluated the impact of folate depletion on uracil accumulation, BER activity and UDG activity in folate depleted UNG+/+ and UNG-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Additionally, cell growth in response to folate deficiency was also determined by completing doubling time in folate depleted UNG+/+ and UNG-/- cells. As expected, levels of uracil significantly increased in UNG+/+ and UNG-/- cells in response to folate depletion. Uracil-DNA glycosylase (Udg) activity, which is responsible for the removal of uracil during the base excision (BER) pathway, significantly decreased in folate depleted UNG-/- cells. Such decreases in Udg activity corresponded to the decrease in nuclear UDG protein levels in response to folate deficiency. Similarly, BER capacity significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) decreased in response to folate depletion in UNG+/+ cells, suggesting that folate deficiency inhibits BER in mouse embryonic fibroblasts...|$|R

Fluorouracil is a nucleobase analogue that is metabolised in cells to form at least two active products; 5-fluourouridine monophosphate (FUMP) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate (fdUMP).

Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil that is broken down in cells to produce the active drug. The deoxynucleoside analogues include cytarabine, gemcitabine, decitabine, azacitidine, fludarabine, nelarabine, cladribine, clofarabine, and pentostatin.

In response to this growing trend, a number of gene delivery vectors have been manufactured both to facilitate nucleic acid uptake by target cells and also to promote the transport of genetic materials into the nucleus. The success of gene therapy however depends on the efficient delivery of therapeutic genes into target cells both in vitro and in vivo. Cationic liposomes represent a class of non-viral vectors that have shown the ability to bind and deliver DNA cargo to defective cells efficiently.

40|$|Folate (vitamin B 9) is {{utilized}} for synthesis of both S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) and deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), which {{are required for}} methylation reactions and DNA synthesis, respectively. Folate depletion leads to an imbalance in both AdoMet and nucleotide pools, causing epigenetic and genetic damage capable of initiating tumorigenesis. Polyamine biosynthesis also utilizes AdoMet, but polyamine pools are not reduced under a regimen of folate depletion. We hypothesized that high polyamine biosynthesis, due to the high demand on AdoMet pools, might {{be a factor in}} determining sensitivity to folate depletion. We found a significant correlation (P< 0. 001) between polyamine biosynthesis and the amount of folate required to sustain cell line proliferation. We manipulated polyamine biosynthesis by genetic and pharmacological intervention and mechanistically demonstrated that we could thereby alter AdoMet pools and increase or decrease demand on folate availability needed to sustain cellular proliferation. Furthermore, growing a panel of cell lines with 100 nM folate led to imbalanced nucleotide and AdoMet pools only in cells with endogenously high polyamine biosynthesis. These data demonstrate that polyamine biosynthesis is a critical factor in determining sensitivity to folate depletion and may be particularly important in the prostate, where biosynthesis of polyamines is characteristically high due to its secretory function. —Bistulfi, G., Diegelman, P., Foster, B.

Dynamics {{of changes in the}} transcriptional expression of 28 genes involved in the FOCM network were evaluated at different time points (0, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h) in human hepatoma HepG 2 cell line. Combined experimental and computational approaches were conducted for emphasizing characteristic patterns in the gene expression changes produced by <b>cellular</b> <b>folate</b> deficiency. Bivariate analysis showed that folate deficiency (0. 3 nmol/L of folate vs. 2. 27 mumol/L in control medium) displayed rapid and coordinated regulation during the first 2 h with differential expression for hRfc 1 (increased by 69 %) and Ahcy (decreased by 437 %). Density analysis through the time points gave evidence of differential expression for five genes (Ahcy, Cth, Gnmt, Mat 1 A, Mtrr and hRfc 1). Differential expression of Ahcy, Gnmt, Mat 1 A and Mtrr was confirmed by time-series analysis gene expression. We also found a marked differential expression of Mtrr. Qualitative analysis of genes allowed identifying four clusters of gene that was coexpressed. Two of these clusters were consistent with specific metabolic functions as they associated genes involved in the remethylation (Mthfr and Mtrr) and in the transmethylation (Dnmt 1 and Dnmt 3 B) pathways. The study shows a strong influence of folate status on Mtrr transcription in HepG 2 cells. It suggests also that folate deficiency produces transcription changes that particularly involve the clusters of genes related with the remethylation and the transmethylation pathways...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Cellular</b> <b>folate</b> {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} DNA strand breaks, mutations, and aberrant methylation {{and might be}} {{a risk factor for}} colorectal cancer (CRC). The putative tumor suppressor gene deleted in colorectal carcinoma (DCC) is one of several genes the expression of which seems to be affected by the folate concentration at the tissue level. Decreased expression of DCC may be caused by LOH or hypermethylation, i. e. by events that might be linked to folate deficiency. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze if the folate level and the gene expression levels of reduced folate carrier (RFC- 1) and folylpolyglutamate synthase (FPGS) had impact on the expression of DCC splice variants. METHODS: Quantification of RFC- 1 and FPGS expression in mucosa of 53 CRC patients was performed using real-time PCR whereas DCC splicing variants were detected by automated capillary gel electrophoresis. Total reduced folate concentration was measured with the FdUMP-binding assay (n = 22). RESULTS: Significantly higher expression levels of RFC- 1 (p = 0. 026) and FPGS (p = 0. 05) were found in mucosa expressing the splice variant DCC 342 compared to mucosa that did not. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that RFC- 1 and FPGS (r = 0. 49, p = 0. 01) as well as folate and RFC- 1 (r = 0. 56, p = 0. 023) were correlated only in mucosa expressing DCC 342. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the present study points to a potential influence of folates in regulating DCC expression at multiple levels involving post-transcriptional pathways. The results may provide a basis for a detailed investigation of molecular mechanisms involved in folate regulation of DCC expression...|$|E

40|$|Although {{antisera}} {{to specific}} placental folate receptors inhibits the uptake of 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate into cultured malignant human cells, {{little is known}} of the functional significance of folate receptors in normal human cells. Human bone marrow cells were therefore assayed for erythropoietic burst-forming units {{in the presence of}} an antihuman placental folate receptor serum and preimmune serum to determine the role of such a receptor in erythroid differentiation. When marrow cells were assayed in the presence of anti-receptor antiserum, there was (i) a threefold increase in erythropoietic burst formation and a twofold {{increase in the number of}} cells per erythroid burst; (ii) morphological evidence for nuclear/cytoplasmic dissociation of orthochromatic normoblasts composing erythroid bursts (megaloblastic erythropoiesis); (iii) intracellular folate deficiency with a 70 % reduction of intracellular folate in antiserum treated cells as compared with control cells; and (iv) complete reversal of antiserum-induced changes on preincubation of antiserum with purified human placental folate receptor.

40|$|<b>Cellular</b> {{acquisition}} of <b>folate</b> is mediated by folate receptors (FRs) in many malignant and normal human cells. Although FRs are upregulated in folate deficiency and downregulated following folate repletion, the mechanistic {{basis for this}} relationship is unclear. Previously we demonstrated that interaction of an 18 -base cis-element in the 5 ′-untranslated region of FR mRNA and a cystolic trans-factor (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein E 1 [hnRNP E 1]) is critical for FR synthesis. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling this interaction, especially {{within the context of}} FR regulation and folate status, have remained obscure. Human cervical carcinoma cells exhibited progressively increasing upregulation of FRs after shifting of folate-replete cells to low-folate media, without a proportionate rise in FR mRNA or rise in hnRNP E 1. Translational FR upregulation was accompanied by a progressive accumulation of the metabolite homocysteine within cultured cells, which stimulated interaction of the FR mRNA cis-element and hnRNP E 1 as well as FR biosynthesis in a dose-dependent manner. Abrupt reversal of folate deficiency also led to a rapid parallel reduction in homocysteine and FR biosynthesis to levels observed in folate-replete cells. Collectively, these results suggest that homocysteine is the key modulator of translational upregulation of FRs and establishes the linkage between perturbed folate metabolism and coordinated upregulation of FRs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUtilizing {{the network}} {{thermodynamic}} approach, {{it is possible}} to simulate large, nonlinear dynamic systems on SPICE 2. For this purpose SPICE 2 can become a general systems simulator {{in spite of the fact}} that it was originally designed for simulating integrated electrical circuits. As an example of the utility of SPICE 2 for large metabolic systems which involve nonlinear kinetics, feedback inhibition of a number of kinds and branching pathways, the <b>cellular</b> <b>folate</b> metabolism scheme is modeled. This scheme is a source of intermediates for de novo purine and pyrimidine metabolism utilized in DNA and RNA synthesis. The action of antifolates that specifically inhibit the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), is simulated in some detail. In particular, the potential of feedback inhibition of secondary sites by dihydrofolate (DHF) polyglutamates that accumulate in the presence of antifolates is modeled to investigate the possible role of such inhibition as opposed, or in addition to, the classical role of tetrahydrofolate (THF) cofactor depletion in the suppression of purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis after blockage of DHFR. The interplay of mathematical modeling, computer simulation, network thermodynamics and experimental observations gave rise to the following conclusions: (1) THF cofactor depletion alone can account for the rapid cessation of purine and pyrimidine synthesis in S-phase cells by antifolates; (2) feedback inhibition by DHF polyglutamates need not be implemented in the mechanism of antifolate inhibition; and (3) the lack of complete interconversion of THF cofactors to DHF does not appear to be related to inhibition of thymidylate synthase by DHF polyglutamates, since this would only slow the accumulation of but not change the final DHF and THF levels in cells with antifolates...|$|E
40|$|Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) {{is a major}} hepatic {{enzyme that}} {{converts}} S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine while generating sarcosine from glycine, hence it can regulate mediating methyl group availability in mammalian cells. GNMT is also a major hepatic folate binding protein that binds to, and, subsequently, may be inhibited by 5 -methyltetrafolate. GNMT is commonly diminished in human hepatoma; yet its role in <b>cellular</b> <b>folate</b> metabolism, in tumorigenesis and antifolate therapies, is not understood completely. In the present study, we investigated the impacts of GNMT expression on cell growth, folate status, methylfolate-dependent reactions and antifolate cytotoxicity. GNMT-diminished hepatoma cell lines transfected with GNMT were cultured under folate abundance or restriction. Folate-dependent homocysteine remethylation fluxes were investigated using stable isotopic tracers and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Folate status was compared between wild-type (WT), GNMT transgenic (GNMT(tg)) and GNMT knockout (GNMT(ko)) mice. In the cell model, GNMT expression increased folate concentration, induced folate-dependent homocysteine remethylation, and reduced antifolate methotrexate cytotoxicity. In the mouse models, GNMT(tg) had increased hepatic folate significantly, whereas GNMT(ko) had reduced folate. Liver folate levels correlated well with GNMT expressions (r = 0. 53, P = 0. 002); and methionine synthase expression was reduced significantly in GNMT(ko), demonstrating impaired methylfolate-dependent metabolism by GNMT deletion. In conclusion, we demonstrated novel findings that restoring GNMT assists methylfolate-dependent reactions and ameliorates the consequences of folate depletion. GNMT expression in vivo improves folate retention and bioavailability in the liver. Studies on how GNMT expression impacts the distribution of different folate cofactors and the regulation of specific folate dependent reactions are underway.

40|$|Folates are {{essential}} for nucleic acid synthesis and required particularly in rapidly proliferating tissues, such as intestinal epithelium and hemopoietic cells. Availability of dietary folates is determined by their absorption across the intestinal epithelium, mediated by the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) at the apical enterocyte membranes. Whereas transport properties of PCFT are well characterized, regulation of PCFT gene expression remains less elucidated. We have studied the mechanisms that regulate PCFT promoter activity and expression in intestine-derived cells. PCFT mRNA levels are increased in Caco- 2 cells treated with 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (vitamin D 3) in a dose-dependent fashion, and the duodenal rat Pcft mRNA expression is induced by vitamin D 3 ex vivo. The PCFT promoter region is transactivated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and its heterodimeric partner retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXRalpha) {{in the presence of}} vitamin D 3. In silico analyses predicted a VDR response element (VDRE) in the PCFT promoter region - 1694 /- 1680. DNA-binding assays showed direct and specific binding of the VDR:RXRalpha heterodimer to the PCFT(- 1694 /- 1680), and chromatin immunoprecipitations verified that this interaction occurs within living cells. Mutational promoter analyses confirmed that the PCFT(- 1694 /- 1680) motif mediates a transcriptional response to vitamin D 3. In functional support of this regulatory mechanism, treatment with vitamin D 3 significantly increased the uptake of [(3) H]-folic acid into Caco- 2 cells at pH 5. 5. In conclusion, vitamin D 3 and VDR increase intestinal PCFT expression, resulting in enhanced <b>cellular</b> <b>folate</b> uptake.

G alpha 4 is developmentally regulated, is essential for proper morphogenesis and spore production, and functions cell nonautonomously. We show that G alpha 4 is coupled to receptors (alpha FAR) that activate chemotaxis and adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases in response to folate {{during the early stages}} of development and to a late class of folate receptors (beta FAR) that have different specificities for pterins. G alpha 4 is preferentially expressed in cells randomly distributed within the aggregate that are a component of the anterior-like cell population, and it is not detectably expressed in prespore cells. Our results suggest that an endogenous factor, possibly a pterin, produced during multicellular development is a requisite signal for multicellular development, acting through G alpha 4. We propose that the G alpha 4 -expressing cells function as a regulatory cell type controlling prespore cell fate, possibly in response to an endogenous pterin.

Folate deficiency may increase NTD risk by decreasing DNA methylation, but to date, human studies vary widely in study design in terms of analyzing different clinical subtypes of NTDs, using different methylation quantification assays and using DNA isolated from diverse types of tissues. Some studies have focused mainly on global DNA methylation differences while others have quantified specific methylation differences for imprinted genes, transposable elements and DNA repair enzymes. Findings of global DNA hypomethylation and LINE- 1 hypomethylation suggest that epigenetic alterations may disrupt neural tube closure.
