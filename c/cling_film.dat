40|$|The current {{trend in}} coating {{industry}} is toward functional coating. The concept of functional building {{and even now}} the term ‘smart building’ have been the guide line for architects to diligently consider especially in high rise building. One particular fact considered is {{the maximum amount of}} light that enters the building. Thus, most high rise buildings incorporate glass panels that allow maximum amount of sunlight into the building. Whilst sunlight is free, the Ultra Violet (UV) can be hazardous. Thin film UV protective layer are regularly used on cars and glass panels are effective to block the unwanted UV rays but they have drawbacks. The <b>films</b> <b>cling</b> to the glass panels by adhesive between the plastic films and the glass and it will lose its functionality over some time and bubbles start to appear. The films need to be removed once these happened. Thus, films are definitely not an option to block unwanted UV rays in high rise building. Therefore, a clear coating that can bind to glass chemically is the best option for higher durability. In this research work, low temperature curing sol gel coating was developed for UV protective coatings. Glycidoxypropyl trimethoxy silane and amino propyl triethoxy silane were used as binders for high clarity with functionality of UV absorber coatings.

Twelve steers (approximately two years of age) were selected and slaughtered at the Ruakura abattoir under a standard slaughtering process. Both loins (M. longissimus dorsi) from all animals were randomly allocated into two treatments [stretching (4 S) or control] (left or right) depending upon sides and three ageing times (1, 7 and 14 days of ageing). Assigned stretching loins were stretched with a 4 S machine (Fix-All Services Company Ltd, Hamilton, New Zealand) whereas non-stretched loins (controls) were wrapped in <b>cling</b> polyethylene <b>film.</b> Initial and final lengths of 4 S stretched loins were measured. The entire sampling and treatment process was conducted in approximately around one hour and then all meat loins were transported to a laboratory for storage at - 1. 5 °C. At 24 hours post mortem, {{the length of the}} stretched loins was measured again and all meat loins were cut into three sections in preparation for three different ageing times. The meat sections of 7 and 14 day aged loins were weighed to determine for purge loss measurement prior to vacuum packaging. At the assigned ageing times (1, 7 and 14 days of ageing), each loin was separated into five parts for different measurements including shear force (two tenderometers), sarcomere length, drip loss and biochemistry analysis (proteolysis). The meat loins aged for 7 and 14 days were reweighed to determine purge loss. The results showed that there was on average a 33 % increase in length by 4 S and {{there was no significant difference}} in pH value due to the 4 S treatment. In addition, there was no significant difference for sarcomere length between treatments. Shear force values were not influenced by 4 S (P > 0. 05); however, ageing contributed to an improvement in tenderness (P < 0. 05). Moreover, there was no significant effect of the 4 S treatment on water-holding capacity of loins. A Western blot assay showed that there was no stretching effect on extent of proteolysis of desmin degradation early post mortem; however, with ageing apparent evidence on muscle protein degradation was observed. For a fuller picture of the value of 4 S treatment, the 4 S technology should be applied to a range of beef muscles to attain with different percentage increases in length, types of cattle, either electrical stimulated or not, various pH values, different ageing times and temperatures to explore optimal extent of stretching to achieve maximum meat tenderness...|$|R
40|$|During this quarter, {{significant}} {{progress has been}} made in the following, fronts of coal log pipeline research, development and technology transfer: 1. Design of the special 300 -ton coal log compaction machine was completed, Furthermore, much {{progress has been made}} in the design of the system needed to feed coal into the coal log compaction machine, and the design of the system to remove logs automatically as soon as they are compacted. 2. Coal mixtures containing different amounts of moisture were compacted into 1. 91 - inch-diameter coal logs rapidly (in 6 seconds). It was found that for the Mettiki coal tested, the optimum moisture is around 8 %. Under the test conditions (room temperature and 3 % binders), the rapidly compacted coal logs with 8 % moisture had less than 4 % weight loss in 350 cycles of circulation. 3. Completed evaluation of the effectiveness of using wall lubricants to enhance coal log quality. Both calcium sterarate and MoS{sub 2 } were found to be effective. 4. It was found that when the interior of a mold is not cleaned after coal log has been compacted, the coal mixture <b>film</b> <b>clinging</b> to the wall hardens in time and form a hard crust which affects the quality of the next log to be produced.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{periodic}} towers {{is to have}} sheet metal discs partially submerged in hot, power plant condenser effluent. As the discs rotate, local sections of the discs alternately absorb heat from the effluent and discharge heat to the air. The means of heat transfer on the air side can be either evaporative and/or convective, depending upon the amount of effluent carried into the air side {{on the surface of}} the plates. An oil layer, floated on the water's surface, has been shown to be effective in eliminating water carry-over to the air side. The advantages of the periodic tower lie in the low cost of the discs and the ability to operate dry. A periodic tower is significantly less expensive than a conventional dry tower fabricated with finned tubes. Further, with the capacity of being operated wet, the high capacity losses incurred during warm months by finned tube towers can be eliminated. The effort to evaluate periodic cooling towers has been a three-pronged thrust: 1) A full scale model of a periodic heat exchanger was designed and is being built to optimize the overall performance and determine the economic competitiveness of this new form of heat exchanger. In the periodic exchanger cooling air is forced over the top portion of a long horizontal row of circular discs slowly rotating in a hot water bath. This large model, over twenty-five feet long and ten feet high with a two and one half by one foot test section, will provide actual test data to verify previous performance optimization calculations and allow for research and development to continue on many design details for this new concept. 2) Disc Ribbing - Roughened Surfaces An existing computer design routine for optimizing periodic cooling towers has been modified by increasing the number of variables from 5 to 8. This was done to account for the effects of roughened surfaces on heat exchanger performance. The modified optimum computer design program yields a periodic tower configuration having the lowest incremental cost for power operation, but it is impractical because the optimized rib heights are smaller than the oil <b>film</b> <b>clinging</b> to the discs. Taking into account the effect of the coating oil thickness on the surfaces, sensitivity studies on the influences of the roughened surfaces on the incremental cost have been made. A specific 5 ft. diameter roughened surface heat exchanger yields a 15 to 20 % savings of capital and incremental cost over a smooth heat exchanger of the same diameter. This economically warrants the use of roughened rather than smooth surfaces for periodic heat exchangers. 3) Flow visualization tests indicate that the mixing of water in the periodic exchanger trough is strongly dependent upon both the water's inlet and outlet points, and the rotational direction of the plates. Various mixing currents in the trough for different geometries have been observed by use of dye injection. Silicone oils, because of their lower vapor pressure and subsequent low rate of evaporation, appear to be superior to petroleum based oils.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{comparison}} of the effectiveness and practicality of using different multi-metal deposition processes for finger mark development. The work investigates whether modifications can be made to improve the performance of the existing process published by Schnetz. Secondly, we compare the ability of different multi-metal deposition processes to develop finger marks on a range of surfaces with that of other currently used development processes. All published multi-metal deposition processes utilise an initial stage of colloidal gold deposition followed by enhancement of the marks with using a physical developer. All possible combinations of colloidal gold and physical developer stages were tested. The method proposed by Schnetz was shown to be the most effective process, however a modification which reduced the pH of the enhancement solution was revealed to provide the best combination of effectiveness and practicality. In trials comparing the modified formulation with vacuum metal deposition, superglue and powder suspensions on surfaces which typically give low finger mark yields (<b>cling</b> <b>film,</b> plasticised vinyl, leather and masking tape), the modified method produced significantly better results over existing processes for <b>cling</b> <b>film</b> and plasticised vinyl.

We evaluated the use of different membranes (three types of commercially available household <b>cling</b> <b>film,</b> condom, surgical glove and Opsite) applied over the ultrasound probe to determine if these were safe, convenient, cost effective and did not impair the performance parameters of the ultrasound probe. None of the membranes impaired the physical scanning parameters using a Multi-Purpose Tissue/Cyst Phantom. The <b>cling</b> <b>film</b> was ideal for general use in terms of cost and convenience as well as safety, For sterile use time Opsite was better overall compared to the surgical glove, though it costs significantly more. The condom and surgical glove, though safe, were not very convenient to use for scanning. This record was migrated from the OpenDepot repository service in June, 2017 before shutting down...|$|E
40|$|Editor's note: It {{goes without}} saying that Culture Change readers are {{interested}} in sustainability and non-cruelty, and stand for peace and nonviolence. However, Peter Goodchild's new piece is a tour de force, touching on fish-hook making, constructing traps, preparing hides, etc., from his first-hand experience, and is a quintessential do-it-yourself (DIY) resource. - JL Yes, I know, the only meat you’re allowed to eat is the kind that sits in a Styrofoam tray and is covered with <b>cling</b> <b>film...</b>|$|E
30|$|The US {{practitioner}} {{is responsible}} for ensuring that only dedicated US transducer covers are used which are of adequate quality. Covers used should display the CE mark of quality testing or its equivalent. Barriers such as thin household <b>cling</b> <b>film,</b> plastic wraps or similar are not acceptable as product quality is not assured. Although some studies appear to show a lower perforation rate, the use of condoms as transducer covers is questionable [53, 54]. Even with dedicated transducer covers, perforation rates appear to be quite high, {{although there is a}} paucity of literature and newer materials may prove to be safer [55 – 57].|$|E
40|$|Gas {{exchange}} in fruits, in particular oxygen transport in apples, was studied non-intrusively using wavelength modulation diode laser absorption spectroscopy at about 761 run, {{applied to the}} strongly scattering intact fruit structure. The applicability of the technique was demonstrated by studies {{of the influence of}} the skin to regulate the internal oxygen balance and of <b>cling</b> <b>film</b> in modifying it by observing the response of the signal from the internal oxygen gas to a transient change in the ambient gas concentration. Applications within controlled atmosphere fruit storage and modified atmosphere packaging are discussed. The results suggest that the technique could be applied to studies {{of a large number of}} problems concerning gas {{exchange in}} foods and in food packaging. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
