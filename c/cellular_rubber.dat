5000|$|Moon Boots are {{footwear}} first {{created in}} the early 1970s by manufacturer Tecnica Group of Giavera del Montello, Italy. [...] They became a notable fashion trend throughout the 1980s. The boot is constructed with a thin rubber outsole and <b>cellular</b> <b>rubber</b> midsole covered by colorful Nylon fabrics and using polyurethane foams. Tecnica registered worldwide the trademark Moon Boot name in 1978. [...] Tecnica still offers the Moon Boot [...] though there are many imitators. With the trademark's registrations, the authentic Tecnica boot {{is the only one}} able to be marketed as a [...] "Moon Boot". Since 2011 they have been produced in Ukraine, at the rate of some 700,000 per year.|$|E
40|$|Soft <b>cellular</b> <b>rubber</b> {{profiles}} {{are used}} as seals for car body applications due to their favorable damping and wear behavior. To shorten development cycles and to improve product quality numerical simulations are carried out. The material behavior of <b>cellular</b> <b>rubber</b> is bimodular and compressible. An appropriate material model was developed and implemented into the MARC software package. An experimental procedure to determine material parameters for this model was set-up and verified...|$|E
50|$|The {{shaft of}} the oar {{ends with a}} thin flat surface 40 to 50 cm long and 25 cm wide, {{variously}} called the blade or spoon. Further along are the loom (or shaft), 2/3 {{of the way up}} which is the sleeve (including a wearplate) and button (or collar), and at the very end the handle. The handle may revert to wooden or, particularly in the case of sculls and some 21st century models of sweep-oar blades have <b>rubber,</b> <b>cellular</b> foam, suede or for example wood veneer grips over glass fiber.|$|R
40|$|The {{anatomy of}} {{young and old}} stems of Aristolochia macrophylla has been {{investigated}} for {{a better understanding of}} how secondary growth processes cause changes in the stem anatomy of a lianescent plant. In A. macrophylla, following an increase in volume of secondary vascular tissues, the cortical tissues are deformed and the outer sclerenchymatous cylinder ruptures. Morphometric measurements prove that the inner zone of the cortical parenchymatous tissue is compressed prior to the rupture of the outer sclerenchymatous cylinder. After the rupture has occurred, the radial width of the inner primary cortex slightly increases again. This could be caused by strain relaxation, suggesting that the inner primary cortex mechanically behaves similarly to <b>cellular</b> technical foam <b>rubbers.</b> Two different experiments were undertaken to test the outer cortical cylinders mechanically. The outer cortical cylinders comprise the outer sclerenchymatous cortical tissue and a collenchymatous sheath underneath the epidermis and the epidermis. In a first experiment, transverse compression loads were applied to the outside of the cortical cylinders causing ovalization of the cylinder until failure. This experiment allowed the Young's Modulus of the outer cortical cylinders to be determined. In a second set of experiments, radial hydraulic pressure was applied to the inside of the cortical cylinders, mimicking the mechanical effects of internal growth processes. The increase of the internal pressure finally led to rupture of the cortical cylinders. The circumferential stresses acting on the inner surface of the cortical cylinders were calculated. These data allow quantitative estimates of the radial and circumferential pressures effected by vascular secondary growth processes during ontogeny in A. macrophylla stems. The experimental results further indicate that the outer sclerenchymatous cylinder is the main contributor to mechanical stability of young A. macrophylla stems...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the effect of silica (SiO 2) and calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) on compounding torque, mechanical, physical, morphological properties, and swelling behaviour of cellular natural rubber, using a compression moulding and conventional vulcanisation (CV) system with oxybisbenzenesulphonylhydrazine (OBSH) as a blowing agent, the moulding cure temperature and time being 160 oC and 7 mins respectively. The <b>cellular</b> <b>rubber</b> vulcanisates were characterised with respect to tensile strength, abrasion resistance, thermal aging, swelling and deswelling behaviours. The results in dicated that the addition of 20 phr SiO 2 in the rubber compound was the most preferable for the tensile strength and abrasion resistance, this being associated with reinforcing effects between the silica and rubber molecules, which also promoted the swelling resistance in toluene during equilibrium state. In the case of CaCO 3 filler, added into the rubber compounds having 20 phr SiO 2, the optimum CaCO 3 content to maintain the overall properties was between 20 and 30 phr. The CaCO 3 above 30 phr reduced the tensile and abrasive properties of the compounds due to the excessive fillers (silica and calcium carbonate) contents being greater than 50 phr. Addition of CaCO 3 {{had no effect on}} the swelling behaviour of the compounds. Considering the effect of thermal aging in the SiO 2 filled rubber compounds, it was observed that the mechanical properties of non-filler <b>cellular</b> <b>rubber</b> tended to decrease whereas the swelling resistance increased with aging, this being due to the desulphuration of the surphur crosslinks. However, the properties of the NR compounds containing 20 phr SiO 2 and various contents of CaCO 3 were unaffected by thermal aging. In summary, the recommended mixed fillers contents for SiO 2 and CaCO 3 in this work were 20 phr and 20 - 30 phr, respectively...|$|E
