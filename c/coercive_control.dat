A 2010 systematic review of the literature on women's perpetration of IPV concluded that with male partners, women's use of IPV is overwhelmingly in response to their partner’s violence either in self-defense or in retaliation.|$|E

40|$|Child care {{providers}} {{play an important}} role in feeding young children, yet little is known about children’s influence on providers’ feeding practices. This qualitative study examines provider and child (18 months − 4 years) feeding interactions. Trained data collectors observed 200 eating occasions in 48 family child care homes and recorded providers’ responses to children’s meal and snack time behaviors. Child behaviors initiating provider feeding practices were identified and practices were coded according to higher order constructs identified in a recent feeding practices content map. Analysis examined the most common feeding practices providers used to respond to each child behavior. Providers were predominately female (100 %), African-American (75 %), and obese (77 %) and a third of children were overweight/obese (33 %). Commonly observed child behaviors were: verbal and non-verbal refusals, verbal and non-verbal acceptance, being “all done”, attempts for praise/attention, and asking for seconds. Children’s acceptance of food elicited more autonomy supportive practices vs. <b>coercive</b> <b>controlling.</b> Requests for seconds was the most common behavior, resulting in <b>coercive</b> <b>controlling</b> practices (e. g., insisting child eat certain food or clean plate). Future interventions should train providers on responding to children’s behaviors and helping children become more aware of internal satiety and hunger cues...|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about {{intimate}} partner abuse (IPA) in divorcing Hispanic parents and how divorcing Hispanic parents utilize legal, social, or community services in regards to their experience of IPA. Research has identified many barriers for Hispanics attempting to access these services, including {{lack of knowledge of}} laws and services, lack of access, discrimination, and language barriers. This study aimed to understand the underlying dyadic structures of IPA and how such abuse affects the utilization of civil court processes in addition to social, community, and health services. Data sources included records from the civil court and mediation services, self-reports of intimate partner abuse, and law enforcement records. This paper focused on a subsample from a larger study and included 187 Hispanic couples and 467 non-Hispanic White couples. Results revealed differences between groups in terms of <b>coercive</b> <b>controlling</b> behaviors and their relationship with other forms of IPA. The strength of the relationship between <b>coercive</b> <b>controlling</b> behaviors and IPA victimization was equal for Hispanic husbands and wives, and also equal to White husbands' IPA perpetration, but had a weaker relationship between White wives' IPA perpetration. Overall Hispanic and Non-Hispanic White couples had similar interactions with the civil court system, ranging from time to complete the divorce and interactions with the court after divorce. Within the Hispanic group, couples with at least one partner preferring Spanish were significantly less likely to complete the divorce process, and had fewer contacts with the court after the divorce was finalized. Hispanic couples who were identified as experiencing IPA were significantly less likely to utilize certain helping services, but not others. Possible explanations, limitations, and future directions are explored...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} some of {{the ways}} in which intervention approaches for perpetrators of intimate partner violence (IPV) might be enhanced through the explicit consideration of the offense process.

This group, for whom violence is instrumental, are not only likely to be at highest risk of offending, but also the most difficult to treat. They are more likely to have long developmental histories of violence, hold entrenched attitudes, and utilize knowledge about the effects of intimidation to avoid detection. It is suggested that specific consideration of what is known about the causes and correlates of IPV in those who follow this approach-explicit pathway can improve the outcomes of current perpetrator behavior change programs...|$|R
40|$|Aggression and {{violence}} are themes which characterize {{a significant proportion}} of many close romantic relationships. Both women and men may find themselves caught in a web of intimate terror – controlled, manipulated, and hurt by a coercive and violent partner. In this brief review article, we summarize existing literature on the form of intimate partner violence known as <b>coercive</b> <b>controlling</b> violence (CCV), domestic abuse, or intimate terrorism. We begin by discussing the nature and consequences of CCV relationships. Personal or individual (e. g., biological sex, age, immigrant status, socioeconomic status, attitudes and beliefs, mental health and psychopathology), relational or interpersonal (e. g., relationship type, relationship satisfaction), and environmental (e. g., economic strain, social isolation) risk factors associated with the occurrence of domestic abuse are identified. Finally, potential preventative measures at the individual, interpersonal, and sociocultural level that may serve to reduce the likelihood of this pernicious interpersonal phenomenon are considered...|$|R

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{empirical}} {{research has demonstrated that}} intimate partner violence is not a unitary phenomenon and that types of domestic violence can be differentiated with respect to partner dynamics, context, and con-sequences. Four patterns of violence are described: <b>Coercive</b> <b>Controlling</b> Violence, Violent Resistance, Situational Couple Violence, and Separation-Instigated Violence. The controversial matter of gender symmetry and asymmetry in intimate partner violence is discussed in terms of sampling differences and methodological limitations. Implications of differentiation among types of domestic violence include the need for improved screening measures and procedures in civil, family, and criminal court and the possibility of better decision making, appropriate sanctions, and more effective treatment programs tailored to the characteristics of different types of partner violence. In family court, reliable differentiation should provide the basis for determining what safeguards are necessary and what types of parenting plans are appropriate to ensure healthy outcomes for children and parent–child relationships.

After collecting peer nominations for popularity, 218 early adolescents (Mage= 11. 0 years) in 109 randomly composed same-sex dyads participated in a discussion task where they planned a party for their classroom. From digital recordings of the sessions, each participant's influence, involvement, skillful leadership, <b>coercive</b> resource <b>control,</b> submissiveness, positivity, and negativity were observed.

50|$|The {{most extreme}} form of such {{violence}} may be termed intimate terrorism, coercive controlling violence, or simply <b>coercive</b> <b>control,</b> {{which is where}} one person is violent and controlling; this is generally perpetrated by men against women, and {{is the most likely}} of the types to require medical services and the use of a women's shelter.

[...] Johnson reported in 2001 that 97% of the perpetrators of intimate terrorism were men.

5000|$|Mindful of this, process {{theology}} makes {{several important}} distinctions between {{different kinds of}} power. The first distinction is between “coercive” power and “persuasive” power. [...] Coercive power is the kind that is exerted by one physical body over another, such as one billiard ball hitting another, or one arm twisting another. Lifeless bodies (such as the billiard balls) cannot resist such applications of physical force at all, and even living bodies (like arms) can only resist so far, and can be coercively overpowered. While finite, physical creatures can exert coercive power over one another in this way, God—lacking a physical body—cannot (not merely will not) exert <b>coercive</b> <b>control</b> over the world.|$|E
