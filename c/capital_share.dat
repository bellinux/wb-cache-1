Had the CBA kept the BankWest Commercial Loan Book, it (the CBA) would have faced a $49 billion increase in, recurring interest costs, and regulatory and capital holding costs.(Calculation estimate). From the outset, the CBA {{made no attempt to}} capital raise the extra $17 billion in Tier 1 <b>Capital</b> (<b>Share</b> Capital in the case of BankWest). Instead the CBA only raised $2 billion in payment of BankWest's existing Share capital (the Initial Purchase Price). In avoidance of raising the extra $17 billion in BankWest Tier 1 Capital, BankWest under reported the BankWest Commercial Loan Book by $10.3 billion, in its first Basel II Risk Disclosure dated 31 March 2009.|$|E

50|$|The {{preferred}} and <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> of {{the split}} corporation are issued in some fixed ratio. Often the preferred and <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> are issued in precisely equal numbers. In such a case, {{each pair of}} preferred and <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> is sometimes called a unit. However, the proportion of preferred and <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> does not necessarily have to be one-to-one. Reducing the ratio of issued preferred <b>shares</b> to <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> (e.g., one preferred share for every two <b>capital</b> <b>shares)</b> would reduce the risk and safely support higher yield for the preferred shares {{at the cost of}} making the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> less attractive to investors due to increased risk, lower sustainable yield payout and smaller capital gain leverage.|$|R

Dividend payments to the holders of <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> may be reduced or even suspended entirely before reductions can be considered in the dividends paid to the holders of the preferred shares. The value of the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> on the secondary markets may fluctuate considerably and may be reduced to zero. Over the longer term, the risk to the holders of <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> should be moderated by the usually high quality of the underlying dividend-paying shares, typically blue-chip, in the basket.|$|R

50|$|The <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> of a {{split share}} {{corporation}} {{are intended to}} be a more aggressive investment vehicle, one that can provide both high income and the promise of amplified capital gains compared to the capital gains of the underlying basket of shares. In effect, the holders of <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> are borrowing money from the holders of the preferred shares at the dividend rate of the preferred shares, and investing that money in a greater number of shares in the underlying basket of <b>shares.</b> <b>Capital</b> gains (or losses) are amplified in the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> because the value of the preferred shares is held relatively constant, and the resulting increased volatility of the equity in the underlying basket of shares is borne mostly by the <b>capital</b> <b>shares.</b> Holders of the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> take on their obligation to guarantee dividend payments to the holders of the preferred shares in exchange for amplified returns. In addition, the income from the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> can be structured to be treatable, for tax purposes, as mostly or even entirely capital gain. In many jurisdictions, such as Canada, capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than either dividend income or interest income.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{importance}} for structural transformation of three features of sectoral technology: labor-augmenting technological progress, capital intensity, and substitutability between capital and labor. We estimate CES production functions for agriculture, manufacturing, and services on postwar US data and {{compare them with}} Cobb-Douglas production functions with different and with equal <b>capital</b> <b>shares.</b> We find that sectoral differences in labor-augmenting technological progress are the main force behind the trends in observed relative prices and sectoral labor. As a result, sectoral Cobb-Douglas production functions with equal <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> (which by construction abstract from differences in the elasticity of substitution and in <b>capital</b> <b>shares)</b> {{do a good job}} of capturing the postwar US structural transformation...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we measure}} {{the effect of}} {{changing}} <b>capital</b> income <b>shares</b> upon inequality of gross household income. Using EU-SILC data covering 17 EU countries from 2005 to 2011 we find that <b>capital</b> income <b>shares</b> are positively associated with the concentration of gross household income. Moreover, we show that the transmission of a shift in <b>capital</b> income <b>shares</b> into the personal distribution of income depends on the concentration of capital income in an economy. Using fixed effect models we find that changing <b>capital</b> income <b>shares</b> {{play an important role}} in the development of household income inequality. Hence, in many industrialized countries income inequality has by no means evolved independently from the observed structural shift in factor income towards a higher <b>capital</b> income <b>share</b> over the last decades...|$|R
