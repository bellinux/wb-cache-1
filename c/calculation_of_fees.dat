The development in the quality of waste disposal leads to significantly higher costs per inhabitant, but it does not explain the significantly different costs between the public local waste disposal carriers. An essential step to obtain a decrease in costs is the introduction of sample service programs and a service-oriented cost calculation. This is {{to be seen as a}} first step towards effective controlling. Cost-benefit analyses are recommended. Special attention has to be paid to the planning of waste processing plants. As a perspective, a decrease in the rise of costs can be expected.

The funds are held by the Swedish Nuclear Waste Fund. The Swedish parliament has decided that this fee shall cover all expenses for the decontamination and decommissioning of older historic waste that stems from Swedish nuclear installations and research reactors within the original Swedish Nuclear program. The task to inject enough capital into the Swedish Nuclear Waste Fund is vital and crucial for the long-term sustainability of the Swedish financing system. Therefore it is of prime importance that provisions to the fund reflect the future authentic costs of performing the planned tasks to decontaminate and dismantle these older nuclear facilities. Purpose of the project The aim of this applied study has been to describe in a systematic way an appropriate methodological sequence for cost estimation of crucial parameters in decontamination and decommission processes. The work has been limited to older nuclear installations and facilities. Furthermore, it may be envisaged that the process of estimating the parameters of decommissioning {{is one of the main}} issues in preparatory phases of decommissioning processes.

The privatization of commercial waste for utilization under the Waste Management Law of 1996 resulted in a low level of capacity utilization of municipal waste treatment facilities. Besides, the requirements concerning the (thermal or mechanical-biological) pre-treatment of waste are not met on time, as a consequence of omissions at local level and privately. In order to explain the fundamental change from the former “battle over waste” among privately owned and municipal enterprises to the present bottleneck in refuse disposal, first of all the waste industry is briefly characterized in the context of environmental protection (2.). After that its legal framework is dealt with in an abridged version and partly commented on (3.). In this the basic problem is the distinction between energetic waste utilization and thermal waste disposal that is in dispute in case of waste incineration. The actual legal practice of the European Court of Justice has resulted in a utilization instead of the former disposal friendly interpretation of the concept of waste. It contributed – among other reasons – to a surplus capacity of municipal incinerating plants.

It is the objective of achieving uniform standards of refuse disposal to control the disposal of waste by the way of meeting environmental standards to heighten the reliability of corporate planning but not - like at present - by means of different prices of refusing dispose. In order to explain the fundamental change from the “battle about waste” between privately owned enterprises and municipalities to a future “state of emergency regarding refuse disposal” the waste industry will be briefly characterized in the context of environmental protection (2.)

40|$|Abstract: The use <b>of</b> {{development}} impact <b>fees</b> (DIFs) {{to finance}} public facilities necessary to accommodate new growth {{is a concept}} that has gained acceptance in recent years. California and Florida are {{considered by many to be}} the leading areas for the development of theory, practical models, and legislation for determining growth-related costs and calculating impact- fees for new construction. Two methods <b>of</b> <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> impact <b>fees</b> are discussed: inductive and deductive. A total of 22 potential impact fees for public facilities have been identified, including the conventional water, sewer, and street impact fees. Other potential impact fees include public safety facilities (police and fire), library, public art, and day-care facilities. The consequences of not using impact fees to offset the cost of providing adequate public facilities for new growth are far-reaching. Often the full effects of growth are not felt, or recognized, by the community for many years.

40|$|Can plaintiffs recover attorney’s fees under 42 U. S. C. § 1988 {{when they}} {{establish}} constitutional violations but recover only nominal damages or low compensatory damages? Some federal appellate courts {{have concluded that}} no fee, or a severely reduced fee, should be awarded in such circumstances. This position, which we call the “low award, low fee” approach, rests primarily on the Supreme Court’s 1992 opinion in Farrar v. Hobby. We argue that a “low award, low fee” approach is misguided for two main reasons. First, the majority opinion in Farrar is fragmented and the factual record is opaque regarding what and how the plaintiff’s constitutional rights were violated. These complexities render Farrar a poor case upon which to frame a rule regarding the relationship between damage awards and the proper <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> attorney’s <b>fees.</b> Second, the “low award, low fee” approach is inconsistent with congressional intent. When Congress enacted § 1988 it emphasized the public benefit of vindicating constitutional rights and deterring constitutional violations. No less important, it recognized that the harms caused by constitutional wrongs often are not easily {{measured in terms of}} traditional monetary remedies – a circumstance that would discourage attorneys from taking on the representation of plaintiffs in this important set of cases. The low award/low fee approach contravenes these purposes because it effectively discourages the bringing of large numbers of highly meritorious cases involving the abridgement of constitutional rights.
