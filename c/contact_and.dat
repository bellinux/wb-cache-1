5|$|Louisville's {{second drive}} {{of the game}} was much quicker than the Cardinals' first. After {{beginning}} at their own 20-yard line, it took the Cardinals just seven plays to travel 80yards and earn a touchdown. Louisville was helped throughout the drive by repeated Virginia Tech personal foul penalties. Tech players committed three separate 15-yard personal fouls during the drive, one of which came after Louisville's successful extra point kick when cornerback Jimmy Williams bumped a game official. Williams was ejected from the game for the <b>contact</b> <b>and</b> {{was removed from the}} field after watching the next series from the sidelines. The touchdown and extra point extended Louisville's first-quarter lead to 14–3.|$|E

5|$|Seven {{minutes after}} the restart, Whelan was penalised for an offence {{on the edge of}} the Liverpool area. Winterburn took the {{resulting}} indirect free kick, from which Alan Smith scored with a header. Liverpool's players protested, claiming Smith had not made <b>contact</b> (<b>and</b> thus the goal should have been disallowed, coming directly from an indirect free kick) or that there had been a push by O'Leary. After consulting his linesman, the referee David Hutchinson awarded the goal. After the match, he recalled none of the Liverpool players knew why they had protested, and TV replays confirm that Smith made contact.|$|E
5|$|Smallpox {{is highly}} contagious, but {{generally}} spreads more slowly and less widely {{than some other}} viral diseases, perhaps because transmission requires close <b>contact</b> <b>and</b> occurs after {{the onset of the}} rash. The overall rate of infection is also affected by the short duration of the infectious stage. In temperate areas, the number of smallpox infections were highest during the winter and spring. In tropical areas, seasonal variation was less evident and the disease was present throughout the year. Age distribution of smallpox infections depends on acquired immunity. Vaccination immunity declines over time and is probably lost within thirty years. Smallpox is not known to be transmitted by insects or animals and there is no asymptomatic carrier state.|$|E

40|$|Background rVSV-ZEBOV is a recombinant, {{replication}} competent {{vesicular stomatitis}} virus-based candidate vaccine expressing a surface glycoprotein of Zaire Ebolavirus. We tested {{the effect of}} rVSV-ZEBOV in preventing Ebola virus disease in <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> <b>contacts</b> of contacts of recently confirmed cases in Guinea, west Africa. Findings In the randomised part of the trial we identified 4539 <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> <b>contacts</b> of contacts in 51 clusters randomly assigned to immediate vaccination (of whom 3232 were eligible, 2151 consented, and 2119 were immediately vaccinated) <b>and</b> 4557 <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> <b>contacts</b> of contacts in 47 clusters randomly assigned to delayed vaccination (of whom 3096 were eligible, 2539 consented, and 2041 were vaccinated 21 days after randomisation). No cases of Ebola virus disease occurred 10 days or more after randomisation among randomly assigned <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> <b>contacts</b> of contacts vaccinated in immediate clusters versus 16 cases (7 clusters affected) among all eligible individuals in delayed clusters. Vaccine efficacy was 100 % (95 % CI 68 · 9 – 100 · 0, p= 0 · 0045), and the calculated intraclass correlation coefficient was 0 · 035. Additionally, we defined 19 non-randomised clusters in which we enumerated 2745 <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> <b>contacts</b> of contacts, 2006 of whom were eligible and 1677 were immediately vaccinated, including 194 children. The evidence from all 117 clusters showed that no cases of Ebola virus disease occurred 10 days or more after randomisation among all immediately vaccinated <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> <b>contacts</b> of contacts versus 23 cases (11 clusters affected) among all eligible <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> <b>contacts</b> of contacts in delayed plus all eligible <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> <b>contacts</b> of contacts never vaccinated in immediate clusters. The estimated vaccine efficacy here was 100 % (95 % CI 79 · 3 – 100 · 0, p= 0 · 0033). 52 % of <b>contacts</b> <b>and</b> <b>contacts</b> of contacts assigned to immediate vaccination and in non-randomised clusters received the vaccine immediately; vaccination protected both vaccinated and unvaccinated people in those clusters. 5837 individuals in total received the vaccine (5643 adults and 194 children), and all vaccinees were followed up for 84 days. 3149 (53 · 9 %) of 5837 individuals reported at least one adverse event in the 14 days after vaccination; these were typically mild (87 · 5 % of all 7211 adverse events). Headache (1832 [25 · 4 %]), fatigue (1361 [18 · 9 %]), and muscle pain (942 [13 · 1 %]) were the most commonly reported adverse events in this period across all age groups. 80 serious adverse events were identified, of which two were judged {{to be related to}} vaccination (one febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one possibly related (influenza-like illness); all three recovered without sequelae...|$|R
