50|$|Simultaneous {{death is}} a problem of {{inheritance}} which occurs when two people (sometimes referred to as <b>commorientes)</b> die at, or very near, the same time, and {{at least one of them}} is entitled to part or all of the other's estate on their death. This is usually the result of an un-natural death occurring from events such as an accident, a homicide, or a murder-suicide.|$|E
50|$|Another aspect worth mentioning, {{occurs when}} {{a number of people}} are killed in the same {{disaster}} (<b>commorientes)</b> {{and it is difficult to}} determine who died first. It might be important to be able to determine who died first in order to choose the beneficiaries, especially if the victims are family members. It could happen that the estate of the victims is devolved as if they died simultaneously whilst in actual fact one or more of them died at a later time.|$|E
50|$|He was on {{intimate}} {{terms with}} the famous courtesan Gnathaena (Athenaeus xiii. pp. 579, 583). He {{is said to have}} written 100 comedies; of these plays, only the titles and associated fragments of fifty-four of them are preserved. He sometimes acted himself. To judge from the imitations of Plautus (Casina from the Κληρούμενοι, Asinaria from the Ὀναγός, Rudens from some other play), he was very skilful in the construction of his plots. Terence also tells us that he introduced into the Adelphi (ii. I) a scene from the Συναποθνήσκοντες, which had been omitted by Plautus in his adaptation (<b>Commorientes)</b> of the same play.|$|E
50|$|The {{common law}} {{provision}} that, without evidence, {{there can be}} no presumption as to which of the <b>commorientes</b> died first, was superseded by the passage of the Law of Property Act 1925, Section 184. Under this statute, where the order of death of two persons is uncertain, the elder of the two is deemed to have died first. This can cause difficulties where for example the elder person had children prior to marriage. The rules can be ousted if inappropriate by an explicit provision in a will. Wills generally have a survivorship clause, typically of 30 days, so that both partner's estates are dealt with as though they were already widowed at the point of death; in cases of intestacy, the survivorship clause is set at 28 days.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to provide a {{critical}} appraisal of the English law in relation to the doctrine of <b>commorientes</b> with particular reference to its implications in respect of property held on a joint tenancy. The article suggests a measure of reform which would produce a fairer dsitribution of joint property in circusmtances where all joint tenants have died in a common disaster and it cannot be ascertained which joint tenant died first...|$|E
