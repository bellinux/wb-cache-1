50|$|<b>Census</b> <b>divisions</b> (CDs) {{are used}} for {{statistical}} purposes by Statistics Canada. Quebec is divided into 98 CDs, {{each of which is}} assigned a unique two-digit geographical code. For the most part, <b>census</b> <b>divisions</b> consist of a single RCM or TE (territory equivalent to an RCM), exactly as defined above. The only exceptions are five <b>census</b> <b>divisions</b> divided into 11 RCMs or TEs, two or three each. For a list, see List of regional county municipalities and equivalent territories in Quebec#Use as <b>census</b> <b>divisions.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In Quebec, 93 of 98 <b>census</b> <b>divisions</b> {{correspond}} {{precisely to}} {{the territory of}} one regional county municipality (with the addition of Indian reserves, which do not legally belong to RCMs) or a [...] "territory equivalent to an RCM" [...] (which usually corresponds to a single independent city). However, there are five <b>census</b> <b>divisions</b> consisting {{of two or three}} RCMs or equivalent territories each. See List of <b>census</b> <b>divisions</b> of Quebec.|$|R
50|$|Statistics Canada {{aggregates}} statistical {{census data}} into <b>census</b> <b>divisions,</b> which follow boundaries {{of one or}} more large local government units.

25|$|A single-tier {{municipality}} is a <b>census</b> <b>division</b> {{which is}} governed by one municipal administration, with neither a county nor regional government above it, nor further municipal subdivisions below it (cf. independent city). A single-tier municipality is either a former regional municipality or a former county, whose municipal governments were amalgamated in the 1990s into a single administration. A single-tier municipality {{should not be confused}} with a separated municipality, which is a municipality that is administratively separated from its county, but is not considered a separate <b>census</b> <b>division.</b> With the exception of Greater Sudbury, single-tier municipalities are found only in Southern Ontario.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, the Census Bureau {{divides the}} country into four census regions and nine <b>census</b> <b>divisions.</b> The bureau also divides {{counties}} (or county equivalents) into either <b>census</b> county <b>divisions</b> or minor civil division, depending on the state. The American state of Alaska does not include counties, instead being divided into 19 boroughs and 10 <b>census</b> <b>divisions.</b>|$|R

25|$|The City of Ottawa is a single-tier municipality, {{meaning it}} is in itself a <b>census</b> <b>division</b> and has no county or {{regional}} municipality government above it. As a single tier municipality, Ottawa has responsibility for all municipal services, including fire, emergency medical services, police, parks, roads, sidewalks, public transit, drinking water, storm water, sanitary sewage and solid waste. Ottawa is governed by the 24-member Ottawa City Council consisting of 23 councillors each representing one ward and the mayor, currently Jim Watson, elected in a citywide vote.|$|E

25|$|Greater Sudbury is {{the most}} populous {{municipality}} and census metropolitan area in Northern Ontario. In the 2016 census, the city's population increased to 161,531, a growth of 0.8 per cent over the 2011 population of 160,274. The median age is 41.1 years, slightly higher than the provincial average of 39.0 years. The census metropolitan area of Greater Sudbury (population 164,770) consists of the city, the town of Markstay-Warren and the adjacent First Nations reserves of Wahnapitei (population 116) and Whitefish Lake (population 386). As the Wahnapitei First Nation is an enclave within the city boundaries, it is also counted as part of Greater Sudbury's <b>census</b> <b>division</b> population of 161,647; this figure excludes Whitefish Lake, {{which is part of}} the separate Sudbury District.|$|E

2500|$|Greater Sudbury is {{the only}} <b>census</b> <b>division</b> in Northern Ontario that {{maintains}} a system of numbered municipal roads, similar to the county road system {{in the southern part}} of the province. There are three highways connecting Sudbury to the rest of Ontario: Highway 17 is the main branch of the Trans-Canada Highway, connecting the city to points east and west. An approximately [...] segment of Highway 17, from Mikkola to Whitefish, is freeway. The highway bypasses the city via two separately-constructed roads, the Southwest and Southeast Bypasses, that form a partial ring road around the southern end of the city's urban core for traffic travelling through Highway 17. [...] The former alignment of Highway 17 through the city is now Municipal Road 55. Highway 69, also a branch of the Trans-Canada Highway, leads south to Parry Sound, where it connects to the Highway 400 freeway to Toronto; Highway 400 is being extended to Greater Sudbury and is scheduled for completion in 2021. Highway 144 leads north to Highway 101 in Timmins.|$|E
