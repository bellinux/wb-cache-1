40|$|Unusual among birds, {{the bill}} tips in crossbills (Loxia spp.) overlap in the {{vertical}} plane, {{with the tip}} of the lower mandible to either the left or right of the tip of the upper mandible when viewed from above. Patterns observed in wild populations and experimental foraging data suggest that a 1 : 1 ratio of left- to right-crossing individuals is maintained by frequency-dependent natural selection in some populations, and that genetic drift causes deviation from a 1 : 1 ratio in other populations. Both processes require a genetic basis for this remarkable polymorphism, yet few data are available that address whether, and how, mandible <b>crossing</b> <b>direction</b> is heritable. To test for a genetic basis of this trait (single or quantitative, autosomal or sex-linked), we analyzed resemblance in mandible <b>crossing</b> <b>direction</b> between related captive-bred individuals of several crossbill taxa with standard statistical techniques as well as modern animal model methodology. Surprisingly, we did not find statistically significant support for a genetic basis of mandible <b>crossing</b> <b>direction.</b> Comparisons of the ratio of left- to right-crossing males and females in wild populations also did not support a sex-linked quantitative genetic basis. We conclude that mandible <b>crossing</b> <b>direction</b> may have uncharacteristically low heritability, but we cannot rule out that it is nongenetically determined.

50|$|Wood pulp for sack {{paper is}} made from {{softwood}} by the kraft process. The long fibers provides the paper its strength and is added wet strength chemicals to even further improve the strength. Both white and brown grades are made. Sack paper is then produced on a paper machine from the wood pulp. The paper is microcrepped to give porosity and elasticity. Microcrepping is done by drying with loose draws allowing it to shrink. This is causing the paper to elongate 4% in machine direction and 10% in <b>cross</b> <b>direction</b> before busting. Machine direction elongation can be further improved by pressing between very elastic cylinders causing more microcrepping. The paper may be coated with polyethylene (PE) to ensure an effective barrier against moisture, grease and bacteria.

The {{objective of the}} present study was to investigate the role of increased blood flow on the biaxial incremental elastic moduli of the porcine right coronary artery (RCA) and to determine the microstructural basis for the changes in moduli. We hypothesized that an increase in RCA flow will lead to increased stiffness in conjunction with remodeling of elastin and collagen in the vessel wall. The control and experimental groups consisted of five RCA vessels each. The RCA of the experimental group was exposed to 4 wk of flow-overload in right ventricular hypertrophy induced by pulmonary artery banding. Stress-strain relationships were determined and the incremental elastic moduli were derived in the circumferential, axial, and <b>cross</b> <b>directions.</b> The results show a significant increase in the elastic moduli in the circumferential (262. 7 ± 15. 7 vs. 120. 2 ± 12. 4 kPa; P < 0. 001), axial (177. 8 ± 25. 5 vs. 100. 3 ± 11. 9 kPa; P = 0. 025), and <b>cross</b> <b>directions</b> (104. 8 ± 8. 2 vs. 68. 2 ± 8. 6 kPa; P = 0. 016) of the experimental RCA compared with controls.

40|$|Soft rot {{caused by}} Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora (Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum) {{is the most}} {{important}} disease of Zantedeschia spp. Cultivation measures can protect the crop partially, but a combination with resistant cultivars could result in better control. Resistant cultivars are not available, however. It is determined in this thesis {{that it is possible to}} breed for resistance caused by Erwinia. Resistance tests as well as a collection of plant material were developed to determine the genetic variation for resistance to Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. The results of four resistance tests were in general concordance with experiences from practice. Although the   tuber tests were most reproducible, the leaf disk test was used further research. The leaf disk test was not destructive, so seedlings and rare germplasm could be evaluated. Among the section Zantedeschia, Z [...] aethiopica appeared resistant to moderately resistant, while Z. odorata appeared susceptible. Only some cultivars of the section Aestivae ('Neroli', 'Coral Sunset' and 'Hazel Marie') appeared significantly less susceptible than the very susceptible reference 'Florex Gold'. Partial resistance was observed in Z. albomaculata subsp. macrocarpa and in Z. rehmannii. To determine the genetic basis of the partial resistance, hybrids were developed of species that have different resistance levels: Z. albomaculata (susceptible to partially resistant), Z. rehmannii (partially resistant), Z. elliotiana (susceptible) and Z. pentlandii (very susceptible). The families of these interspecific crosses (F 1 -hybrids) segregated for leaf colour (chlorophyll content) and vigour, dependent on the parents and the <b>crossing</b> <b>direction.</b> This segregation was not Mendelian, but depended on the <b>crossing</b> <b>direction.</b> Descendents of Z. rehmannii as mother were green (with a chlorophyll content that was similar as selfings of the parents) and vigorous. Descendents of Z. elliotiana as mother, however, were mainly pale green and these were less vigorous in some cases, depending on the father. The cause of these reciprocal differences was determined to evaluate the effect to the level of resistance. Plastome-specific CAPS-markers (Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence) were used to determine that there existed at leat three plastomes that differed in the level of compatibility to the genomes of the different species of section Aestivae. The segregation in leaf colour (chlorophyll content) within families of the same <b>crossing</b> <b>direction</b> originated from plastids that had inherited via pollen. This paternal influence in plastid inheritance was observed in 24 intespecific families of Z. rehmannii, Z. albomaculata, Z. elliotiana and Z. pentlandii. Thus was concluded that   biparental ininheritance of plastids is common common within interspecific crossings among section Aestivae. The plastome of Z. rehmannii was the most compatible to the other genomes. Plants with not fully compatible plastome-genome combinations had decreased vigour and level of resistance. Genetic analyses were therefore performed only on plants that did not suffer from plastome-genome incompatibility. The level of resistance of F 1 -hybrids was correlated to the level of resistance of the parents en transgression was observed in seedlings of Z. rehmannii and Z. albomaculata. This relation indicates a genetic basis for resistance with complementary or additive genes with great potential for resistance breeding...|$|R
