5|$|Donaggio won a 'best {{soundtrack of}} the year' {{award for his}} work on the film, which gave him the <b>confidence</b> <b>to</b> quit his {{successful}} singing career and embark on a career scoring films. Donaggio became a regular composer for Brian De Palma films and credits Nicolas Roeg with giving him his first lesson in writing film scores, and expressed a desire to work with him again.|$|E
5|$|During in-game cutscenes, the polygon {{count is}} {{increased}} to nearly 2,500 polygons, especially on character faces. Capcom added detail to the zombie enemies unprecedented in the series, such as making their jaws move and eyes twitch. Claire {{was given a}} tougher appearance in Code: Veronica than in Resident Evil 2, the reason being her experiences in Resident Evil 2 built her toughness and <b>confidence</b> <b>to</b> handle any situation. This characterization is emphasized by her ability to dual wield sub-machine guns, and also by the opening cinematic which features her in a John Woo-inspired action scene. Mikami described Code: Veronica as 50-60% of his perfect vision for Resident Evil in February 2001, and he cited that future Resident Evil projects may make up the other half.|$|E
5|$|Following a backlash, Dr Manhattan exiles {{himself to}} Mars, giving the Soviets the <b>confidence</b> <b>to</b> invade Afghanistan. Rorschach's theory {{appears to be}} {{justified}} when Veidt narrowly avoids an assassination attempt, and Rorschach finds himself framed {{for the murder of}} a former villain named Moloch. When Rorschach is arrested, his identity is revealed to be Walter Kovacs, and he is sent to jail. Jupiter goes to stay with Dreiberg after breaking up with Manhattan. The two become lovers and decide to come out of retirement. After helping Rorschach break out of prison, Jupiter is confronted by Manhattan, who transports her to Mars. As he probes her memories, he discovers that she is Blake's daughter, and realizes the miracle of her life, created in spite of her parents' turbulent relationship. He then returns to Earth with her.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{prepares for}} an acting {{job in a}} {{laboratory}} safety video that was arranged by his talent agent, Carla Fern (Roseanne Barr). The directors continuously have {{to talk him out}} of overacting, and he backs down from shooting a scene using an eye wash, since he has an aversion towards anything being shot into his eye. However, Carla threatens to have him blacklisted if he does not go through with the scene. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), who came along as friendly support, gives Andy the <b>confidence</b> <b>to</b> shoot the scene, and in the end Andy even insists on doing two takes.|$|E
5|$|Zoe Tapper as Dr. Anya Raczynski. Anya was {{a doctor}} in a busy city {{hospital}} when the virus struck and watched hundreds of patients die of the virus, including her friend and lover Patricia Kelly, and Patricia's flatmate Jenny Walsh. After treating a badly wounded Tom on the road, she joins the group. She privately discloses that, {{in the face of}} the pandemic, her faith in practicing medicine was deeply shaken, and she had initially sought to kill herself. Only later does she regain her <b>confidence</b> <b>to</b> successfully deliver a breech birth infant.|$|E
5|$|A. V. M. Rajan portrayed Shanmugasundaram's brother Thangarathnam. According to playwright Crazy Mohan, Gopulu's {{caricature}} {{of the character}} Vaithi in Subbu's novel was similar to Nagesh, who portrayed Vaithi in the film. Manorama played the wildly expressive, loud-talking but tender-hearted folk dancer Karuppayi, who has to contend with living under the shadows of landlords; she changes her identity {{every now and then}} to escape from them. In an interview with Maalai Malar, Manorama stated that she was initially nervous acting in front of Ganesan and Balaiah, but Nagarajan assured her that whenever her character appeared she would be the centre of attention, which gave her the <b>confidence</b> <b>to</b> play her role. Serial and theatre artist M. L. Bhanumathi played the nurse who treats Shanmugasundaram. Other supporting actors included K. Sarangkapani, S. Ramarao, M. K. Murthy, Balusundaram, T. N. Sivadhanu, S. R. Dasarathan, Sivasooriyan, Senthamarai, Kallapart Natarajan, Gundu Karuppaiah, Chandranbabu, S. V. Rajagopal, A. M. Maruthappa, Udayachandrika, Ambika and Kalpalatha.|$|E

5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is given}} Michael's client list as a going-away present, {{much to the}} shock and envy of the other salesmen, and after losing one, {{requests}} the help of Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) to retain them. Vickers nearly ruins {{a relationship with a}} client but Andy gains enough <b>confidence</b> <b>to</b> salvage the sale. Along the way, Vickers reveals that he was not hired for his business experience, but because he helped prevent the theft of one of Sabre CEO Jo Bennett's dogs. Meanwhile, Dwight (Rainn Wilson) is antagonistic towards Michael, still bitter over Michael not recommending him for a manager position, despite Michael's attempts to reconcile. He initially expresses disdain for Michael's going-away present, a recommendation letter, but appears touched as he reads further. He also discovers a card challenging him to a paintball match, and the two play behind the building.|$|E
5|$|Gallipoli {{marked the}} end for Hamilton and Stopford but Hunter-Weston went on to lead VIII Corps {{on the first day}} of the Battle of the Somme. The {{competence}} of Australian brigade commanders, John Monash (4th Infantry Brigade) and Harry Chauvel (1st Light Horse Brigade, New Zealand and Australian Division), was recognised by promotion to divisional and corps command. The influence of Kitchener waned after the coalition government was formed in May 1915, partly because of the growing sense of failure in the Dardanelles and culminated in Kitchener being over-ruled on support for the French at Salonika in early December 1915, when his influence on the Cabinet was at its lowest. The campaign gave <b>confidence</b> <b>to</b> the Ottomans in their ability to defeat the Allies. In Mesopotamia, the Turks surrounded a British expedition at Kut Al Amara, forcing their surrender in April 1916. Ottoman forces in southern Palestine were poised to launch an attack against the Suez Canal and Egypt. Defeat at the Battle of Romani and lack of materials to complete the military railway, necessary for such an operation, {{marked the end}} of that ambition. The optimism which came from the victory at Gallipoli was replaced by a gathering sense of despair and the British remained on the offensive in the Middle East for the rest of the war.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Wever {{began the}} season {{remaining}} with Fort Lauderdale. He had a 73 {{record and a}} 2.00 ERA in 12 games before being promoted to the Nashville Sounds of the Southern League, the Yankees' AA affiliate. With Nashville, he had a 52 record and 2.05 ERA in nine appearances. Wever's pitching coach in Nashville was Hall of Famer Hoyt Wilhelm. Wilhelm felt he had the ability but not the <b>confidence</b> <b>to</b> pitch in the majors, and spent his time in Nashville working on that aspect of Wever's game. The following season, Weber was almost unanimously named to the Southern League All-Star team, thanks to 11 wins and 116 strikeouts {{through the end of}} June. He improved to a 16-6 record, a 2.78 ERA, and 191 strikeouts, won the Southern League Pitcher of the Year award, and accomplished the pitcher's Triple Crown, leading the league in wins, ERA, and strikeouts. He led Nashville to the Southern League championship, and right after doing so, the Yankees called Wever up to the major leagues.|$|E

5|$|In 1985 {{he played}} for Team USA at the IIHF World Championships. Vanbiesbrouck posted a 6–3–0 record, {{defeating}} three of three top ranked teams in the world (Canada, Czech Republic and Sweden). He later noted that those three victories gave him the <b>confidence</b> <b>to</b> be successful at the NHL level. The Americans were the second seed following the preliminary round. However they failed to win a single game in the championship round and finished the tournament in fourth place. Individually Vanbiesbrouck {{was named to the}} Second All-Star team. Two years later he played in his second World Championship. He was unable to duplicate his prior success posting a 2–5–0 record, as Team USA finished in seventh place one position away from being relegated to Division I. During 1987 Vanbiesbrouck also participated in the Canada Cup, registering a 2–2–0 record with a 2.25 GAA. He registered the lowest GAA in the tournament, but the United States finished in fifth place. He played in two more World Championships in 1989 and 1991 going 1–2–1 and 3–4–2 respectively, as the US improved to sixth place in 1989 and finished just short of winning a medal in 1991 placing fourth. Vanbiesbrouck was named to the Canada Cup team in 1991, but spent the tournament as Mike Richter's back-up. He played only one game in the tournament defeating Finland 4–3. The United States finished the Canada Cup in second place losing the best of three championship to Canada 2–0.|$|E
5|$|In Barden and Grimaldi's article, {{the authors}} could not {{sufficiently}} identify the ant with enough <b>confidence</b> <b>to</b> {{place it in}} a subfamily. Instead, it was incertae sedis within the Formicidae. Although a recent published morphological study provided useful information on the mouthparts of basal ants, placing Cretaceous taxa is still difficult. However, synapomorphies (key diagnostic traits) {{could have been used}} to attempt to place Zigrasimecia. Key synapomorphies for Sphecomyrmine ants include scape (the base segment of the antenna) length; petiole (narrow waist between the thorax and abdomen); and the metapleural gland (secretory glands), as indicated by Barry Bolton's diagnosis. The morphology of Z. tonsora shows a variety of autapomorphies (derived traits) not seen in any other ant species, particularly the structure of the mandibles and mesosomal sculpturing. Another issue in placing Z. tonsora is that the status of Sphecomyrminae had rarely ever been evaluated (perhaps once) via phylogenetic methodology. Due to this, it was possible that the subfamily was not monophyletic.|$|E
5|$|In March 1951 secret United States {{intercepts}} {{of diplomatic}} dispatches disclosed clandestine conversations in which General MacArthur expressed <b>confidence</b> <b>to</b> the Tokyo embassies of Spain and Portugal {{that he would}} succeed in expanding the Korean War into a full-scale conflict with the Chinese Communists. When the intercepts {{came to the attention}} of President Truman, he was enraged to learn that MacArthur was not only trying to increase public support for his position on conducting the war, but had secretly informed foreign governments that he planned to initiate actions that were counter to United States policy. The President was unable to act immediately since he could not afford to reveal the existence of the intercepts and because of MacArthur's popularity with the public and political support in Congress. However, following the release on April 5 by Representative Martin of MacArthur's letter, Truman concluded he could relieve MacArthur of his commands without incurring unacceptable political damage.|$|E

5|$|Kirchner soon distanced {{himself from}} Duhalde, {{removing}} those close to the former president from the government to reduce his political influence. He also sought supporters across {{the social and political}} spectrum to counter Duhalde's influence in the party. Although Duhalde was not initially against Kirchner, Kirchner tried to prevent the presence of alternative leaderships within the PJ. However, they put their differences behind them during the October 2003 legislative elections. Their dispute was fanned by the political weight of Buenos Aires province (the most populous in Argentina, with almost 40 percent of the national vote), and continued through the 2005 midterm elections. Without consensus in the PJ for a candidate for senator in the Buenos Aires province, both leaders had their wives run for office: Hilda González de Duhalde for the PJ and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner for the Front for Victory, which contested the election as a different party. Cristina Kirchner won the election. As in 2003, the elections were defined by Peronist factions; the opposition parties could not put up a united national front. The victory gave Kirchner the <b>confidence</b> <b>to</b> remove Lavagna, Rafael Bielsa, Jose Pampuro, and Alicia Kirchner from his cabinet and replace them with ministers who, though less well-known, had perspectives closer to his own.|$|E

Liz decides to use her new-found <b>confidence</b> <b>to</b> help TGS with Tracy Jordan producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) with a problem he has had with a difficult television editor named Ritchie (Paul Giamatti).

Later, Liz and Ritchie have a pretend break-up in front of Donna, and Donna becomes interested in Ritchie.|$|E
5|$|Sabah state {{government}} also emphasises pre-school {{education in the}} state. This was followed with the aid from Sabah Foundation (Yayasan Sabah) and Nestlé who helped to establish pre-schools in the state. Sabah has two public universities: Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) and Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM). Universiti Tun Abdul Razak (UNIRAZAK) has set up their regional centre in Kota Kinabalu. As of 2016, there is around 15 private colleges, two private university colleges together with other newly established colleges. In 1960, the overall literacy rate in North Borneo was only 24%. The recent findings in 2011 found the literacy rate have increase to 79%. Most of secondary schools leavers also did not continue their studies after completing their Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) mainly due to financial burden as well {{because of the lack}} of interest and <b>confidence</b> <b>to</b> continue their studies in local higher learning institutes, with a survey in 2015 saw only 16,000 out of more than 20,000 secondary schools leavers continuing their studies.|$|E

In addition to Jordan's, Ewing's and Worthy's Hall of Fame NBA careers with the Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers respectively (including a combined 9 NBA championships), Floyd was named an NBA All-Star and still holds playoff records for most points in a quarter and half, while Perkins played in the league for 17 seasons. For Jordan's part, his game-winner is often seen as the launching point of his career - the moment that gave him the <b>confidence</b> <b>to</b> become what many {{believe to be the}} greatest basketball player of all time, in no small part due to his clutch performance.
