40|$|In January of 1986 my brother, Ed M. Brogie, and I were {{tallying}} our {{lists for}} Nebraska {{when the question}} arose: 2 ̆ 2 How many species of birds do you think one could see in Nebraska in one year? 2 ̆ 2 The previous year (1985) {{had been the first}} year we had made a serious attempt at seeing western Nebraska species and chasing rarities in the state. Our efforts had yielded such birds as Bean Goose, Green-tailed Towhee, Black-necked Stilt, Red Phalarope, Lewis 2 ̆ 7 Woodpecker, Sprague 2 ̆ 7 s Pipit, Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Finch, Cassin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Kingbird,</b> and King Eider. When 1985 ended, my Nebraska life list stood at 290 and I had seen 237 species in the state for the year, without any real attempt to see migrant songbirds.... In summary, I found all of the 197 birds I had given a Code 1, and 53 of the 54 Code 2 species (missed Hermit Thrush). Of the 40 birds I had given a Code 3 I had found 26. Included in my total were 12 Code 4 birds and 3 Code 5 species. Each species counted in the total had at least one witness or was documented with a photograph.... All in all, 1986 was a great year for birding and I had a fun time playing the game. One always thinks about the species he missed, but I know I 2 ̆ 7 ll remember for life some that I found. It was a year I learned {{a great deal about the}} birds of Nebraska, and about Nebraska as a whole. Perhaps the best part of birding in 1986 was making new acquaintances, spending time with old friends, and just sharing the joys and experiences that go with the sport...|$|R
40|$|I {{estimate}} that 215 bird species currently breed or have previously bred in Nebraska. This number compares {{with a total}} of 330 spe¬cies that breed or have bred in the Great Plains region south of Canada, as I defined that region in my book on the breeding birds of the Great Plains (Johnsgard, 1979). An analysis of the relative species diversity of Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s breeding avifauna establishes several areas of unusual species richness and endemicity, these most important being the Missouri Valley and associated middle to lower Niobrara Valley, the Pine Ridge area of the northwestern Panhandle, and the entire Platte Valley. Species of Birds Considered as Pandemic Breeders Across Nebraska include Pied-billed Grebe American Bittern Great Blue Heron Black-crowned Night Heron Canada Goose Mallard Northern Pintail Blue-winged Teal Red-tailed Hawk American Kestrel Northern Harrier American Coot Killdeer Rock Dove Mourning Dove Yellow-billed Cuckoo Barn Owl Great Horned Owl Long-eared Owl Common Nighthawk Belted Kingfisher Downy Woodpecker Hairy Woodpecker Western Kingbird Eastern Kingbird Northern Rough-winged Swallow Bank Swallow Cliff Swallow Barn Swallow Blue Jay American Crow House Wren American Robin Gray Catbird Loggerhead Shrike European Starling Yellow Warbler Common Yellow-throat Blue Grosbeak Chipping Sparrow Lark Sparrow Grasshopper Sparrow Red-winged Blackbird Western Meadowlark Yellow-headed Blackbird Common Grackle Brown-headed Cowbird American Goldfinch House Sparrow Species of Birds Considered to be Endemic to Specific Nebraska Regions include Northwestern Panhandle Endemics: White-throated Swift Lewis 2 ̆ 7 Woodpecker Cordilleran Flycatcher Plumbeus Vireo Pinyon Jay Violet-green Swallow Brown Creeper Pygmy Nuthatch Mountain Bluebird Townsend 2 ̆ 7 s Solitaire Swainson 2 ̆ 7 s Thrush Sage Thrasher Western Tanager Yellow-rumped Warbler Brewer 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow Dark-eyed Junco McCown 2 ̆ 7 s Longspur Chestnut-collared Longspur; Lower Missouri Valley Endemics: Red-shouldered Hawk Broad-winged Hawk Chuck-wills-widow White-eyed Vireo Carolina Wren Summer Tanager Northern Parula Cerulean Warbler Prothonotary Warbler Kentucky Warbler Yellow-throated Warbler; Southwestern Panhandle Endemics: Mountain Plover Cassin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Kingbird</b> Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Sparro...|$|R
40|$|Of {{interest}} to many {{is evidence of}} northward movement of species which generally summer on the Great Plains. In addition to White-winged Dove and Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, both slowly establishing as breeders in Nebraska, significant numbers of Glossy Ibis continue to be found, probably associated with major increases in numbers of White-faced Ibis. Perhaps the biggest surprise this late summer and early fall was {{the large number of}} Lesser Goldfinches reported from the southern Panhandle. Less exciting by far, but worthy of attention were reports of several Mute Swans in the Omaha area, including a duo of juveniles, and a couple of sightings of Monk Parakeets, last known to breed in the state in 1998. Neither would be welcome additions to the breeding avifauna of Nebraska. Notable western species found in the east included California Gull and Rufous Hummingbird, while Cassin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Kingbird</b> and Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Vireo crept eastward farther than usual. Most surprising in this group, however, was a Pygmy Nuthatch in Lincoln, a very rare vagrant in general. A mention also for Varied Thrush, a rare but annual visitor from way west, of which 3 were reported. Conversely, best eastern bird west was an immature Blackburnian Warbler banded in Scotts Bluff County. Relative to last year 2 ̆ 7 s good numbers, both Red-breasted Nuthatch and Purple Finch were back to normal levels. At the time of this writing, no notable incursions of winter birds had been detected. Among regular migrants, Blue-headed Vireo, Nashville Warbler, and Orange-crowned Warbler appeared in excellent numbers; the migration period for Orange-crowned Warbler occupied all of 3 months. Strangely, Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler, usually abundant as a migrant in the west, was at a low ebb. In the category of phenomena, the huge roost of Purple Martins in central Omaha, peaking at 35, 000, was unprecedented as far as we know. Finally, an identification note. Two vireos of the 2 ̆ 2 Solitary 2 ̆ 2 complex were banded, measured, and well photographed in Scotts Bluff County by Nancy Gobris of Nebraska Prairie Partners. Measurements indicated both were unequivocally Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s, but plumage characters indicated at least one may have been a Plumbeous...|$|R
40|$|First, some {{housekeeping}} is in order.... You {{will also}} notice {{the new order}} of species (AGAIN!!), reflecting the latest American Ornithologists 2 ̆ 7 Union Checklist, published this spring. The most noticeable change concerns the placement of shrikes and vireos between flycatchers and corvids; but the order of species within some genera also differs, especially among the waterfowl, where, for instance, swans now follow the geese. And now let 2 ̆ 7 s turn to the birds! As in most summers, many species went about their business in routine fashion, hence the notation 2 ̆ 2 Routine Reports 2 ̆ 2 for many. We encourage observers to note and to forward evidence of breeding for all species, including dates for nests, eggs, and young. These data help us document changing patterns for various species. Interesting developments this summer in terms of breeding populations include {{the expansion of the}} Eurasian Collared-Dove 2 ̆ 2 colony 2 ̆ 2 at the Newcomb residence in Kearney; the continued presence of an outlying population of Chuck-will 2 ̆ 7 s-widow at Morse Bluff; further evidence of the northward spread of Acadian Flycatcher in the Missouri Valley; expansion of the Cordilleran Flycatcher population in the western Pine Ridge; continuation of the outlying Say 2 ̆ 7 s Phoebe group in Dixon Co; an increased population of Cassin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Kingbird</b> and Blue-gray Gnatcatcher in the Panhandle, and expansion (probably temporary) of Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow into the southwest Sandhills. In addition, three species of shorebirds arrived early: Baird 2 ̆ 7 s Sandpiper, Greater Yellowlegs, and Buff-breasted Sandpiper. A noticeable number of warblers also migrated late, including Orange-crowned and Nashville (both 2 nd latest ever), Blackpoll, Black-and-white (possibly breeding), and Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s.

Mark Brogie, Creighton, and I birded the western border of Nebraska in June 1986, trying {{to see some of}} the birds that breed out there. On 15 June we located a pair of Lewis’s Woodpeckers (Melanerpes lewis) in the Dead Horse Burn area of Chadron State Park. The same day we encountered a pair of Cassin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Kingbirds</b> (Tyrannus vociferans) north of Hay Springs, on the road to Metcalf Wildlife Area, Sheridan County. On 16 June, while birding Sowbelly Canyon, Brogie found a singing Solitary Vireo (Vireo solitarius) in the transition zone between the ponderosa pines and the deciduous riparian woodland. In the wide open short grass prairie west of Harrison we successfully searched for Brewer’s Sparrows (Spizelli breweri). Nesting McCown’s (Calcarius mccownii) and Chestnut-collared Longspurs (C. ornatus) were the consolation for an unsuccessful search [for Mountain Plover] in hot, inhospitable surroundings. —Bill Huser, South Sioux City MINDEN NOTES. I saw a Northern Harrier on 2 February 1986, and two Magpies 15 February, and a Prairie Falcon 27 February. During that period I also saw Red-tails and Kestrels, and an occasional Rough-leg and Ferruginous, and in March Swainson’s Hawks. I saw small groups of Lapland Longspurs and Horned Larks on 2 February, Sandhill Cranes in the Platte valley 8 March, and three Killdeer 16 March. My brother, Elwin, observed a Short-eared Owl during the winter. On 6 April Mourning Doves were here, and on 20 April I saw a Snowy Egret. On 4 May I saw three or four Lark Buntings and a Great Blue Heron. On 29 June I found a Mourning Dove nest with two eggs; on 19 July I saw a young Killdeer learning to fly, and on 3 August I saw a young Upland Sandpiper, just learning to fly, with its parents. My cousin, Robert Spicknall, and I saw a Yellow-crowned Night-Heron on 6 and 13 July. On 6 July Mr. Harvey Bell called my attention to an active nest of a Blue Grosbeak, with three young in it.

40|$|While Stanley Kubrick 2 ̆ 7 s film Full Metal Jacket has {{remained}} in the national consciousness twenty years after its release, the author of its source material, Gustav Hasford, has not. Few people know or remember that the Oscar-nominated film was not an original work but was adapted by Hasford, Kubrick, and Dispatches author Michael Herr from Hasford 2 ̆ 7 s 1979 novel The Short-Timers. Fewer people remember that following the well-reviewed The Short-Timers Hasford published a sequel, The Phantom Blooper, {{as well as one}} final novel A Gypsy Good Time, a frenetic parody of detective fiction. To say that Gustav Hasford is primarily remembered as the originator of Full Metal Jacket, or as the owner of the largest library book theft case in United States history, would be inaccurate because Gustav Hasford, for the most part, is not remembered. There are several reasons as to how Gus Hasford came to slip through the cracks of history. For starters, his books have been out of print since 1992, partially because Hasford refused to let The Short-Timers be reprinted under the title of `Full Metal Jacket 2 ̆ 7 and in doing so passed up the chance to reap the financial benefits of added royalties or the exposure another reprinting would have brought him. Additionally, Hasford {{died at the age of}} in 1993 at the age of 45, just after his last book was quietly released and with the third book in his planned Vietnam trilogy barely started. The eccentric Hasford found it difficult when alive to retain goodwill amongst either the literary or film communities, feuding with publishers and directors alike. After his death, with his literary career cut short and disgruntled publishers in no mind to market or reprint his books, Hasford fell almost entirely into the oblivion of public memory, both his work and his life essentially forgotten. For my Master 2 ̆ 7 s Thesis I propose a study both of Hasford 2 ̆ 7 s life and his work for the purpose of shedding light on a talented but forgotten author. No extensive biographical study of Hasford has been attempted since the obituaries that followed his death in 1993, and scholarly examination of his literature has been limited to a few scattered book reviews and a short overview of Hasford 2 ̆ 7 s work by his cousin/de facto literary executor. I intend to examine Hasford 2 ̆ 7 s life, which included amongst other highlights a tour as a marine combat correspondent, a stint in jail following the largest library fine ever assessed, several weeks spent living on Harlan Ellison 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>couch,</b> a sophomore novel he would send to book reviewers inscribed with a proclamation that the work was 2 ̆ 2 Dead on Arrival 2 ̆ 2 because his editor had ruined it, and a personality so tempestuous that it led legendarily difficult-to-work-with Stanley Kubrick to eventually throw up his hands and insist that Hasford was a man HE could not deal with. Additionally I will undertake a critical examination of the key themes running through the two books in his unfinished Vietnam Trilogy, The Short-Timers and The Phantom Blooper, as well as the related biographical undertones in A Gypsy Good Time, for all intents and purposes the unintended ending to that trilogy. It is hoped that through my research some long-overdue critical attention will be paid both to Hasford 2 ̆ 7 s novels and to Hasford himself so that he can begin to be recognized as the key contributor to Vietnam War fiction that he was...|$|R
