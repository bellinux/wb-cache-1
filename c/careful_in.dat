5|$|As a {{marriage}} gift, the Tsar gave George {{a group of}} islands in the Petalioi Gulf, which the family visited on the royal yacht Amphitrite. George later purchased a country estate, Tatoi, north of Athens, and on Corfu he built a summer villa called Mon Repos. George developed Tatoi, building roads and planting grapes for making his own wine, Chateau Décélie. Intent on not letting his subjects know that he missed Denmark, he discreetly maintained a dairy at his palace at Tatoi, which was managed by native Danes {{and served as a}} bucolic reminder of his homeland. Queen Olga was far less <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> hiding her nostalgia for her native Russia, often visiting Russian ships at Piraeus two or three times before they weighed anchor. When alone with his wife, George usually conversed in German. Their children were taught English by their nannies, and when talking with his children he therefore spoke mainly English.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in the}} {{aftermath}} of these successes that Alcibiades resolved to finally return to Athens in the spring of 407 BC. Even {{in the wake of his}} recent victories, Alcibiades was exceedingly <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> his return, mindful of the changes in government, the charges still technically hanging over him, and the great injury he had done to Athens. Thus Alcibiades, instead of going straight home, first went to Samos to pick up 20 ships and proceeded with them to the Ceramic Gulf where he collected 100 talents. He finally sailed to Gytheion to make inquiries, partly about the reported preparations of the Spartans there, and partly about the feelings in Athens about his return. His inquiries assured him that the city was kindly disposed towards him and that his closest friends urged him to return.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{themes are}} common in {{werewolf}} fiction; the protagonist kills his girlfriend as she walks with a former lover in Werewolf of London, suggesting sexual jealousy. The writers of Wolf Man were <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> depicting killings as motivated out of hunger.|$|E

Proponents argue that dedicated bike lanes have been implemented in many cities and are both popular and safe.|$|E
25|$|Some people, of course, {{have gone}} {{overboard}} with this search, and caution must be employed; otherwise, {{it is possible}} to find chiasmus in the telephone book, and the effort becomes meaningless …. One must be <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> this quest, however, to avoid the problems of the 'hammer syndrome'—to the person holding a hammer, everything looks like a nail. To the person who knows only chiasmus and no other form of literary composition, everything may start looking like a chiasm.|$|E

25|$|Finally, an {{individual}} strand may exhibit a mixed bonding pattern, with a parallel strand {{on one side}} and an antiparallel strand on the other. Such arrangements are less common than a random distribution of orientations would suggest, suggesting that this pattern is less stable than the anti-parallel arrangement, however bioinformatic analysis always struggles with extracting structural thermodynamics since there are always numerous other structural features present in whole proteins. Also proteins are inherently constrained by folding kinetics as well as folding thermodynamics, so one must always be <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> concluding stability from bioinformatic analysis.|$|E
25|$|Hiring {{discrimination}} {{is similar to}} wage discrimination in its pattern. It typically consists of employers choosing to hire a white candidate over a minority candidate, or a male candidate over a female candidate, to fill a position. A study of employment patterns in the US indicated {{that the number of}} hiring discrimination cases has increased fivefold in the past 20 years. However, their percentage as a whole fraction of the workforce hirings has decreased almost as drastically. With the stiff laws against discrimination in hiring, companies are very <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> who they hire and do not hire.|$|E
25|$|If {{the best}} hand {{is shared by}} more than one player, then the pot is split equally among them, with any extra chips going to the first players after the button in {{clockwise}} order. It is common for players to have closely valued, but not identically ranked hands. Nevertheless, one must be <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> determining the best hand; if the hand involves fewer than five cards, (such as two pair or three of a kind), then kickers are used to settle ties (see the second example below). The card's numerical rank is of sole importance; suit values are irrelevant in hold 'em.|$|E

25|$|In {{discussing}} {{myths about}} Janus, {{one should be}} <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> distinguishing those which are ancient and originally Latin and those others which were later attributed to him by Greek mythographers. In the Fasti Ovid relates only the myths that associate Janus with Saturn, whom he welcomed as a guest and with whom he eventually shared his kingdom in reward for teaching the art of agriculture, and to the nymph Crane Grane or Carna, whom Janus raped and made the goddess of hinges as Cardea, while in the Metamorphoses he records his fathering with Venilia the nymph Canens, loved by Picus, first legendary king of the Aborigines.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} {{court martial}} reprimanded Sykes {{for failing to}} order frequent soundings and for relying {{too much on the}} pilot. It ordered Lieutenant John Fisher, the officer of the watch, to be more <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> the future, especially in keeping the captain aware of his ship's situation. It severely reprimanded the master, Joseph Forster, for not taking continuous sounding and for not informing the captain about his reservations concerning the course being steered. Lastly, the court martial severely reprimanded the pilot, Thomas Robinson, for countermanding the captain's order, and for sailing too close to the shore and without taking soundings. It ordered the pilot to lose all pay due him.|$|E
25|$|Even at {{this early}} stage, the European states fought back: Livorno's {{monument}} Quattro Mori celebrates 16th-century victories against the Barbary corsairs won by the Knights of Malta and the Order of Saint Stephen, of which the Grand Duke of Tuscany Ferdinando I de' Medici was Grand Master. Another response was {{the construction of the}} original frigates; light, fast and maneuverable galleys, designed to run down Barbary corsairs trying to get away with their loot and slaves. Other measures included coastal lookouts to give warning for people to withdraw into fortified places and rally local forces to fight the corsairs. This latter goal was especially difficult to achieve as the corsairs had the advantage of surprise; the vulnerable European Mediterranean coasts were very long and easily accessible from the north African Barbary bases, and the corsairs were <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> planning their raids.|$|E

25|$|While {{studying}} {{at the military}} academy, Chávez generally avoided all discussion of politics with his family, especially whenever he stayed with them during holidays. He particularly disliked political discussion with his father, who was then {{a member of the}} COPEI political party—indeed, his father would eventually rise to the position of Education Director of Barinas during the COPEI administration of Luis Herrera Campins. However, Chávez did enjoy such talk during his regular visits to the Ruiz family household. For several months during 1974, Chávez maintained a personal diary; in it, he was <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> his usage of proper Spanish language. Chávez also expressed a leftist political orientation; writing of his dislike of U.S. foreign policy and Venezuela's perceived lack of a distinct national or cultural identity. As an example, he noted that both Venezuela's national sport (baseball) and Venezuela's popular music ultimately were American in origin.|$|E

Carlson's only praise was for songs [...] "Odyssey #5" [...] and [...] "My Happiness", stating that [...] "oo often, Powderfinger is too earnest, a bit too <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> their career". Carlson noted that despite his critique, the album achieved some success in the American market.|$|E

[...] According to Bill Bishop {{in his account}} of Stengel, [...] "Casey did use language that would certainly be considered offensive today, but was quite common vernacular in the fifties. He was effusive in his praise of black players like Satchel Paige, Larry Doby and Howard." [...] Conscious of changing times, Stengel was more <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> his choice of words while with the Mets.|$|E
500|$|According to Jainism, a monk who is {{careless}} in {{his activities}} {{is guilty of}} violence irrespective of whether a living being remains alive or dies; on the other hand, {{the person who is}} ever vigilant and <b>careful</b> <b>in</b> observing the samitis experiences no karmic bondage simply because some violence may have taken place in connection with his activities. [...] Carefulness came {{to be seen as a}} defence for the monks against violence in Jainism. Tattvārthasūtra defines hiṃsā or violence simply as removal of life by careless activity of mind, body and speech. Thus action in Jainism came to be regarded as truly violent only when accompanied by carelessness.|$|E
