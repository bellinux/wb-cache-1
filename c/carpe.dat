The crowd surrounding the horse during the walk-over from the barns to the paddock upset American Pharoah, and several grooms were required to keep him under control.

500|$|One {{way that}} {{writers such as}} Wollstonecraft helped to shape the new genre of children's {{literature}} {{at the end of}} the 18th century was by attempting to remove its chapbook and fairy tale associations and replace them with a middle-class ideology.

As Kelly explains, [...] "traditional chapbook literature embodies a lottery mentality of <b>carpe</b> diem, belief in fortune, wish for lucky gifts (such as great strength, cleverness or beauty), a view of time as cyclical or repetitive and an avid interest in predicting the future." [...] In contrast, 18th-century children's literature [...] "embodies an investment mentality. This meant saving for the future, ‘proper’ distribution of personal resources, avoiding extravagance, conceiving of time and one’s own life as cumulative and progressive, and valuing self-discipline and personal development for a better future under one’s own control."

40|$|Set in December 2016, {{the case}} follows Sumeet Mehta, CEO of Cardpe Services Private Ltd, a fintech startup {{established}} {{to tap into}} the gap that existed in the payments acceptance infrastructure in India. Cardpe was all set to launch a mobile Point-of-Sale (mPOS) device – a wireless handheld integrated unit - that processed credit/debit card payments. Cash was a predominant medium of transaction in the country but the government was accelerating digitalisation and promoting measures to move towards a less-cash economy. Measures were underway to bring the largely unbanked public into banking network. Correspondingly, debit and credit card issuance was also growing. However, the availability of point-of-sale (POS) devices that could process credit/debit card payments was inadequate and remained concentrated among large merchants in cities. Due to this shortfall, the use of cards for payments remained low. Cardpe intended to target the merchants in the Tier II and Tier III cities, which were largely ignored by the acquiring banks, aggregators and the electronic wallet companies. Mehta had to assess the market potential for mPOS in the increasingly crowded market and to evaluate the odds stacked against Cardpe in the target market and as he re-examines <b>Carpe’s</b> go-to-market strategy.

40|$|De l'urée et du super {{phosphate}} triple ont été appliqués aux étangs d'alevinage de <b>carpes</b> chinoises de la station Deroua pour stimuler {{la croissance}} des algues. Toutefois, une forte proportion de ce phosphore est fixée par les sédiments et sera libérée en grande quantité dans les étangs lorsque les sédiments sont en conditions anaérobies. Nous avons étudié le relargage des orthophosphates par les sédiments provenant de deux étangs différents. L'un (A 1) en terre ce qui permet la percolation des éléments nutritifs vers les couches profondes, l'autre (C 1) dont le fond recouvert d'une fine membrane en polyéthylène, est parfaitement imperméable et empêche toute perte. Par ailleurs, nous avons étudié les effets de l'oxygène dissous, du pH, des nitrates et du glucose sur le relargage des orthophosphates par les sédiments. Les résultats obtenus montrent qu'en anaérobiose, la solubilité du phosphore augmente dans l'eau interstitielle. Les orthophosphates libérés, dont la concentration peut atteindre 873 µg/l, proviennent de la fraction minérale en particulier du Fe(OOH) =P. Le sédiment C 1 qui accumule de grandes quantités de matière organique libère plus de phosphore que le sédiment A 1. L'addition des nitrates limite la mobilisation du phosphore à partir des sédiments. Le pH acide provoque la dissolution du phosphore lié au calcium alors qu'un pH alcalin provoque celle du phosphore lié aux hydroxydes de fer et sa précipitation partielle sur les carbonates présents dans les sédiments. In the Deroua fish farm (Béni-Mellal, Morocco), {{a series of}} ponds was lined with polyethylene to prevent water seepage (lined ponds, C). Another series of ponds was not lined (unlined ponds, A). The lined ponds do not need much fertiliser to enhance phytoplankton growth. They receive a small quantity of urea and triple super phosphate and accumulate high levels of organic matter in their sediments. The unlined ponds receive a large quantity of fertilisers. In the ponds, an important increase in phytoplankton growth occurred particularly after fertilisation with triple super phosphate. The phosphate (P) released from the sediment is the essential source of P for phytoplankton when the ponds are not fertilised. Sediment samples {{used in this study}} were collected in June 1999 from the A 1 and C 1 ponds of the Deroua fish farm. The bottom sediments were collected with a core sampler to provide samples from the 0 - 5 cm layer. The samples were mixed and analysed for pH, total Kjeldahl nitrogen (NTK), nitrates (N-NO 3 -), ammonium (N-NH 4 +), total iron (tot-Fe) and P-fractionation in eight replicates, using the Golterman method (1996). In this work, experiments were conducted to evaluate the P released from sediments of lined and unlined ponds under controlled conditions. The samples included: untreated sediments, sediments treated with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), and sediments treated with chloroform (CHCl 3). H 2 O 2 was used to destroy the organic matter of sediment. To inactivate bacteria, CHCl 3 was added to the sediments. CHCl 3 does not modify the mineral and organic structures of sediments but does reduce the bacterial biomass. Urea and triple super phosphate were added to Chinese carp rearing ponds at Deroua fisheries farm to stimulate algal growth. However, phosphate bound to the sediments was released into the water column during anaerobic conditions. The released phosphate from lined pond (C 1) enhanced the algal production. We have tested the fertilisation capacity of A 1 and C 1 ponds as well as the effects of different factors such as dissolved oxygen, pH, nitrate, and organic matter (glucose) on the phosphate released from the sediments. The results show that under anoxic conditions, phosphate solubility increased in the interstitial water. The released phosphate (873 µg/l) comes from the mineral fraction, particularly from Fe(OOH) =P. The P released from the A 1 untreated sediment under oxic and anoxic conditions was low in comparison to the P released from the C 1 untreated sediment and did not exceed 9. 1 µg. g- 1 d. w. (Figure 1). The removal of organic matter with H 2 O 2 had a positive effect on the P released from the C 1 sediments only after the second day of incubation. The inactivation of bacteria with CHCl 3 had an inhibitory effect on the P released from the C 1 sediments under oxic and anoxic conditions; however for the A 1 sediments, this inactivation of bacteria had no effect on the kinetics of P release. Phosphorus release from the C 1 sediments was important under anoxic conditions; the P came from Fe(OOH) =P after the reduction of Fe(OOH). The addition of nitrates decreased the mobilisation of phosphate from the sediments. Acid conditions increased the dissolution of calcium-bound phosphate, while alkaline conditions increased the dissolution of iron-bound phosphate and its re-precipitation onto carbonate present in sediments. High concentrations of organic matter (glucose) increased oxygen demand and favoured the development of reducing conditions. The phosphate was released from Fe(OOH) =P. The conceptual model of P released in fish ponds shows that, in semiarid climates and in calcareous areas, the polyethylene lining of ponds prevents not only the seepage of water but also the percolation of nutrients. Consequently, the P was more available for algal uptake in the lined ponds. More phosphate will be released concomitant with the process of the ponds becoming anoxic, as nitrate concentrations and the pH of sediments decrease...|$|R
