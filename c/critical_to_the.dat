5|$|French {{psychoanalyst}} Jacques Lacan linked psychoanalysis with Kantian {{ethics in}} his works The Ethics of Psychoanalysis and Kant avec Sade and compared Kant with the Marquis de Sade. Lacan argued that Sade's maxim of jouissance—the pursuit of sexual pleasure or enjoyment—is morally acceptable by Kant's criteria {{because it can}} be universalised. He proposed that, while Kant presented human freedom as <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> moral law, Sade further argued that human freedom is only fully realised through the maxim of jouissance.|$|E
5|$|Hinde {{became a}} circuit rider {{in the early}} 1800s. While his circuit varied over the years, he served large {{portions}} of Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri. Much of the territory he covered was generally lawless, violent and dangerous. Circuit riders served numerous churches and were supposed to plant new ones in new or underserved communities. They were <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of the frontier.|$|E
5|$|In {{the form}} {{trivalent}} chromium, Cr(III), or Cr3+, chromium {{was identified as}} an essential nutrient in the late 1950s and later accepted as a trace element for its roles in the action of insulin, a hormone <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> metabolism and storage of carbohydrate, fat and protein. The precise mechanism of its actions in the body, however, have not been fully defined, leaving in question whether chromium is essential for healthy people.|$|E

5|$|Indiana's {{geographical}} {{location in the}} Midwest, its large population, and its agricultural production made the state's wartime support <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Union's success. Indiana, with the fifth-largest population of the states that remained in the Union, could supply much-needed manpower for the war effort, its railroad network {{and access to the}} Ohio River and the Great Lakes could transport troops and supplies, and its agricultural yield, which became even more valuable to the Union after the loss of the rich farmland of the South, could provide grain and livestock.|$|E
5|$|The French {{were more}} {{successful}} in persuading large landowners to cease support for the rebels and recruit local militias to protect highways from rebel attacks. The French also ultimately understood {{that in order to}} quell the revolt in Syria they needed to offer concessions in Anatolia and establish cooperation with the Turks, whose financial, military and moral support was <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rebels. When truces were reached with the Turks, the French redeployed large numbers of troops from the Anatolian front to suppress the rebels in Syria.|$|E

5|$|There is {{debate about}} {{the exact nature of}} phreatomagmatic eruptions, and some {{scientists}} believe that fuel-coolant reactions may be more <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> explosive nature than thermal contraction. Fuel coolant reactions may fragment the volcanic material by propagating stress waves, widening cracks and increasing surface area that ultimately leads to rapid cooling and explosive contraction-driven eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Whether a Native American tribe was {{friendly}} or warlike was <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fates of European explorers and settlers in that land. Friendly tribes taught newcomers {{how to grow}} indigenous crops, prepare foods, and hunt wild game.

5|$|A strong {{relationship}} existed between Zahir and the Shia Muslim peasants of Jabal Amil and their sheikhs. Zahir maintained {{law and order}} in Jabal Amil, while leaving its mostly Shia inhabitants to their own devices. The Shia also benefited economically from Zahir's monopoly of the cotton industry and their sheikhs provided him men of great military skill to support his struggle against the Ottoman authorities. Zahir was a key backer of the Shia in their war with the Druze Jumblatt clan and the Shihab dynasty under Mulhim Shihab, and likewise, Shia forces were <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> defense of Zahir's sheikhdom against expeditions by the Ottoman governor of Damascus in 1771 and 1772.|$|E

5|$|Although {{historically}} unsubstantiated, {{the story}} of how Zoroastrians gained permission to step on the shores of Gujarat continues to be <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> self-identity of the group. Per the commonly told narrative, the Rajah of Sanjan, summoned them and demanded to know how they wouldn't be a burden on or a threat to the indigenous communities. Replying to their request of practising their religion and till the land, he showed them a jug full of milk, saying Sanjan like it was full. In one version, a dastur added a coin to the milk, saying like the coin, no one would be able to see that they were there but they would enrich the milk nonetheless. In another version, he added sugar instead and claimed that like it, they would sweeten lands of Sanjan. In both of them their settlement is approved by the Rajah who addresses certain conditions for it: they would explain their religion, promise not to prosletyize, adopt Gujarati speech and dress, surrender their weapons and only conduct their rituals after nightfall.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of the metal, toxicological data are available only for compounds. Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. In low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, and higher doses affect the nervous system, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, shortness of breath, and paralysis. This toxicity {{may be caused by}} Ba2+ blocking potassium ion channels, which are <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> proper function of the nervous system. Other organs damaged by water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.|$|E
5|$|Born in Newport, Delaware, Evans {{received}} little formal education {{and in his}} mid-teens was apprenticed to a wheelwright. Going into business with his brothers, he worked {{for over a decade}} designing, building and perfecting an automated mill with devices such as bucket chains and conveyor belts. In doing so Evans designed a continuous process of manufacturing that required no human labor. This novel concept would prove <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Industrial Revolution and the development of mass production. Later in life Evans turned his attention to steam power, and built the first high-pressure steam engine in the United States in 1801, developing his design independently of Richard Trevithick, who built the first in the world a year earlier. Evans was a driving force in the development and adoption of high-pressure steam engines in the United States. Evans dreamed of building a steam-powered wagon and would eventually construct and run one in 1805. Known as the Oruktor Amphibolos, it was the first automobile in the country and the world's first amphibious vehicle, although it was too primitive to be a success as either.|$|E

5|$|Chadwick {{accepted}} that the Americans {{did not need}} British help, but that it could still be useful in bringing the project to an early and successful conclusion. Working closely with {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., he attempted to do everything he could to support the effort. He also endeavoured to place British scientists in as many parts of the project as possible in order to facilitate a post-war British nuclear weapons project to which Chadwick was committed. Requests from Groves via Chadwick for particular scientists tended to be met with an immediate rejection by the company, ministry or university currently employing them, only to be overcome by the overriding priority accorded to Tube Alloys. As a result, the British team was <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Project's success.|$|E
5|$|Claire's main storyline {{in season}} 2 is her advocacy, as Second Lady, for {{a sexual assault}} {{prevention}} bill. During her campaign for the bill a skeleton from her college days emerges: during a nationally televised interview, she admits that she was raped in college and that her rapist, Dalton McGinnis (Peter Bradbury), is now a high-ranking general. (She had earlier had an uncomfortable encounter with McGinnis at a White House dinner, during which she had told Frank what the general had done to her.) She also admits to having aborted a pregnancy that she claims {{was the result of}} the rape; it is later revealed that she in fact aborted Frank's child, with his consent. She then converts the focus on that issue into political support that becomes <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Underwoods' ascension to the Oval Office.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the US Government Accountability Office said a {{shortage}} of lithium-7 <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> operation of 65 out of 100 American nuclear reactors “places their ability to continue to provide electricity at some risk”. The problem stems from the decline of US nuclear infrastructure. The equipment needed to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7 is mostly a cold war leftover. The US shut down most of this machinery in 1963, when it had a huge surplus of separated lithium, mostly consumed during the twentieth century. The report {{said it would take}} five years and $10 million to $12 million to reestablish the ability to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1986, the Huntington Development Corporation {{suggested}} that an off-track betting facility be constructed, however, the idea died after Governor Arch Moore vetoed an off-track betting bill that was <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> project's success. In 1987, the Webb Companies presented {{a plan for a}} $110 million mixed-use complex called RiverCenter that would feature a 20-story office tower, an underground parking garage and a skyway to the Harris Riverfront Park. The project failed when two large tenants could not be found to anchor the project. In 1988, the city's grant to help develop the project was revoked.|$|E
5|$|On 8 February 1942, Albert Speer {{became the}} Reichsminister for Armaments and Munitions and gained {{influence}} over the Navy's construction programs. Speer reassigned {{some members of the}} H class design staff to work on new U-boats and other tasks deemed <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> war effort. The Schiffsneubaukommission (New Ships Construction Commission), intended to liaise with Speer and the OKM, was created and placed under the direction of Admiral Karl Topp. This group was responsible for the design work that resulted in the H-42 type, as well as the subsequent designs. The Construction Office of the OKM formally concluded their work on new battleships with the H-41 type and played no further role in battleship development.|$|E
5|$|Some of the ECM {{equipment}} which initially saw {{use on the}} Victor, such as {{the original}} chaff dispenser and Orange Putter tail warning radar, had been developed for the earlier English Electric Canberra bomber and were already considered to be near-obsolete {{by the time the}} Victor had entered service. Significant improvements and alterations would be made to the avionics and ECM suites, as effective ECMs had been deemed <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Victor's role; for example, the introduction of the more capable Red Steer tail warning radar. The introduction of the Victor B.2 was accompanied by several new ECM systems, including a passive radar warning receiver, a metric radar jammer and communications jamming equipment. Streamlined fairings on the trailing edges of the wings that could house large quantities of defensive chaff/flares were also new additions. While trials were conducted with terrain-following radar and a side scan mode for the bombing and navigation radar, neither of these functions were integrated into the operational fleet.|$|E
