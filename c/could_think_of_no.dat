He put Foveaux's name forward to succeed Collins as Lieutenant-Governor of Tasmania because he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> one more fitting, and considered {{that he could}} not have acted otherwise with regard to Bligh. However, when Foveaux returned to England in 1810 he was court-martialled for assenting to Bligh being deposed and imprisoned; Macquarie's recommendation was ignored. Foveaux was taken back into active service in 1811 and promoted lieutenant-colonel of the Greek Light Infantry; he pursued an uneventful military career after that, rising to the rank of lieutenant-general.|$|E
25|$|A {{retreating}} Siraj-ud-Daulah met the British at Plassey. He {{had to make}} camp 27 {{miles away}} from Murshidabad. On 23 June 1757 Siraj-ud-Daulah called on Mir Jafar because he was saddened by the sudden fall of Mir Mardan who was a very dear companion of Siraj in battles. The Nawab asked for help from Mir Jafar. Mir Jafar advised Siraj to retreat for that day. The Nawab made the blunder in giving the order to stop the fight. Following his command, the soldiers of the Nawab were returning to their camps. At that time, Robert Clive attacked the soldiers with his army. At such a sudden attack, the army of Siraj became indisciplined and <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> way to fight. So all fled away in such a situation. Betrayed by a conspiracy plotted by Jagat Seth, Mir Jafar, Krishna Chandra, Omichund etc., he lost the battle and had to escape. He went first to Murshidabad and then to Patna by boat, but was eventually arrested by Mir Jafar's soldiers.|$|E

Ruth replied that he hoped that [...] "every Jap that mention my name gets shot". Creamer recorded that [...] "Babe Ruth transcended sport and moved far beyond the artificial limits of baselines and outfield fences and sports pages". Wagenheim stated, [...] "He appealed to a deeply rooted American yearning for the definitive climax: clean, quick, unarguable." [...] According to Glenn Stout, [...] "Ruth's home runs were exalted, uplifting experience that meant more to fans than any runs they were responsible for. A Babe Ruth home run was an event unto itself, one that meant anything was possible." ...|$|E

500|$|By 1868, Creangă's rebellious stance was irritating his {{hierarchical}} superiors, and, {{according to}} Călinescu, his consecutive actions {{show that he}} was [...] "going out of his way for scandal". He was initially punished for attending a Iași Theater performance, as well as for defiantly claiming that there was [...] "nothing scandalous or demoralizing" [...] in what he had seen, and reportedly further antagonized the monks by firing a gun to scare off the rooks nesting on his church. The latter incident, which some commentators believe fabricated by Creangă's detractors, was judged absurd by the ecclesiastical authorities, who had been further alarmed by negative reporting in the press. When told that no clergyman other than him had been seen using a gun, Creangă issued a reply deemed [...] "Nasreddinesque" [...] by George Călinescu, maintaining that, unlike others, he was not afraid of doing so. Confronted by Metropolitan Calinic himself, Creangă allegedly argued that he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> other way to eliminate rooks, being eventually pardoned by the prelate when it was ruled that he had not infringed on canon law.|$|E

2500|$|Also in 1891, Chicago businesswoman Bertha Palmer {{approached}} Cassatt {{to paint}} a 12' × 58' mural about [...] "Modern Woman" [...] for the Women's Building for the World's Columbian Exposition {{to be held in}} 1893. Cassatt completed the project {{over the next two years}} while living in France with her mother. The mural was designed as a triptych. The central theme was titled Young Women Plucking the Fruits of Knowledge or Science. The left panel was Young Girls Pursuing Fame and the right panel Arts, Music, Dancing. The mural displays a community of women apart from their relation to men, as accomplished persons in their own right. Palmer considered Cassatt to be an American treasure and <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> one better {{to paint a}} mural at an exposition that was to do so much to focus the world's attention on the status of women. Unfortunately the mural did not survive following the run of the exhibition when the building was torn down. Cassatt made several studies and paintings on themes similar to those in the mural, so it is possible to see her development of those ideas and images. Cassatt also exhibited other paintings in the Exposition.|$|E
2500|$|Citing {{the example}} of the Treaty of Waitangi, first signed on 6 February the {{preceding}} year, Judge Willis declared himself [...] "quite at a loss to discover how the aborigines of New Zealand can be considered in a different light to those of Australia Felix." [...] The amended Commission given to Captain Arthur Phillip had, after all, included within the definition of the colony of New South Wales most of New Zealand, and the Judge said that he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> reason why a similar treaty might be pursued in Australia, given that the rights of indigenous peoples within the same territory and under the same government could surely not be different. From a speech given by Governor of New South Wales George Gipps to the Legislative Council of New South Wales on 9 July 1840, on a bill relating to land grants in New Zealand, Judge Willis quoted long passages demonstrating Gipps' familiarity with American jurisprudence in relation to the relations between Native Americans and white settlers; just as Gipps considered the American experience relevant to the position of the Māori in New Zealand, in Judge Willis' view, it applied equally well to the Aboriginal people in Australia.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the release}} of {{intelligence}} information from the American and Israeli sources, {{the attack on the}} Syrian site was initially controversial. Some commentators had argued {{that at the time of}} the attack the site had no obvious barbed wire or air defenses that would normally ring a sensitive military facility. Mohammed ElBaradei had previously stated that Syria's ability to construct and run a complex nuclear process was doubtful—speaking ahead of the IAEA inspection of the alleged Syrian nuclear site, which has been demolished, he said: [...] "It is doubtful we will find anything there now, assuming there was anything in the first place." [...] The New York Times reported that after the publishing of US intelligence data on April 24, [...] "two senior intelligence officials acknowledged that the evidence had left them with no more than [...] "low confidence" [...] that Syria was preparing to build a nuclear weapon. However, while they said that there was no sign that Syria had built an operation to convert the spent fuel from the plant into weapons-grade plutonium, they had told President Bush last year that they <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> other explanation for the reactor." [...] BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Jonathan Marcus commented on {{the release of}} the CIA video that [...] "Briefings about alleged weapons of mass destruction programmes have a lot to live down in the wake of the US experience in Iraq".|$|E

Since that scene after poor Rex's farewell visit, the mother had felt a new sense of peril in touching the mystery of her child's feeling, and in rashly determining what was her welfare: only she <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> welfare in <b>no</b> other shape than marriage.|$|R

At last he got wearied out and gave it up. No wonder; he had never seen Edie, and could not love her as I did. Once he thought he had discovered her. The body of a poor girl had been found in the river, which he thought answered to her description. I thought so too when he told me what she was like, and at once concluded she had tumbled in by accident and been drowned--for, you see, my Edie was good and pure and true. She could not have committed suicide unless her mind had become deranged, and there was nothing that I knew of to bring about that. They got me with much trouble into a cab, and drove me to the place. Ah! the poor thing--she was fair and sweet to look upon, with her curling brown hair and a smile still on the parted lips, as if she had welcomed Death; but she was not my Edie. For months and months after that I waited and waited, feeling sure that she would come. Then I was forced to leave my lodging. The landlord wanted it himself. I begged that he would let me remain, but he would not. He was a hard-hearted, dissipated man. I took another lodging, but it was a long way off, and left my name and new address at the old one. My heart sank after that, and--and I've no hope now--no hope. My darling must have met with an accident in this terrible city. She must have been killed, and will never come back to me." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1935, Ribbentrop {{arranged}} {{for a series of}} much-publicised visits of First World War veterans to Britain, France and Germany. Ribbentrop persuaded the Royal British Legion and many French veterans' groups to send delegations to Germany to meet German veterans as the best way to promote peace. At the same time, Ribbentrop {{arranged for}} members of the Frontkämpferbund, the official German World War I veterans' group, to visit Britain and France to meet veterans there. The veterans' visits and attendant promises of [...] "never again" [...] did much to improve the [...] "New Germany's" [...] image in Britain and France. In July 1935, Brigadier Sir Francis Featherstone-Godley led the British Legion's delegation to Germany. The Prince of Wales, the Legion's patron, made a much-publicized speech at the Legion's annual conference in June 1935 stating that he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> better group of men than those of the Legion to visit and carry the message of peace to Germany and that he hoped that Britain and Germany would never fight again. As for the contradiction between German rearmament and his message of peace, Ribbentrop argued to whomever would listen that the German people had been [...] "humiliated" [...] by the Versailles treaty, that Germany wanted peace above all, and German violations of Versailles were {{part of an effort to}} restore Germany's [...] "self-respect". By the 1930s, much of British opinion had been convinced that the treaty was monstrously unfair and unjust to Germany, so as a result, many in Britain, such as Thomas Jones, Deputy Secretary to the Cabinet, were very open to Ribbentrop's message that European peace would be restored if only the Treaty of Versailles could be done away with.|$|E

60|$|It {{is largely}} the very {{peculiar}} kind of being {{that belongs to}} universals which has led many people to suppose that they are really mental. We can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a universal, and our thinking then exists in a perfectly ordinary sense, like any other mental act. Suppose, for example, that we are thinking of whiteness. Then in one sense it may be said that whiteness is 'in our mind'. We have here the same ambiguity as we noted in discussing Berkeley in Chapter IV. In the strict sense, it is not whiteness that is in our mind, but the act of thinking of whiteness. The connected ambiguity in the word 'idea', which we noted at the same time, also causes confusion here. In one sense of this word, namely {{the sense in which}} it denotes the object of an act of thought, whiteness is an 'idea'. Hence, if the ambiguity is not guarded against, we may come to think that whiteness is an 'idea' in the other sense, i.e. an act of thought; and thus we come to think that whiteness is mental. But in so thinking, we rob it of its essential quality of universality. One man's act of thought is necessarily a different thing from another man's; one man's act of thought at one time is necessarily a different thing from the same man's act of thought at another time. Hence, if whiteness were the thought as opposed to its object, no two different men <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it, and <b>no</b> one man <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it twice. That which many different thoughts of whiteness have in common is their object, and this object is different from all of them. Thus universals are not thoughts, though when known they are the objects of thoughts.|$|R
60|$|In {{the evening}} of that day I saw the Lord Chancellor. With him, too, I had much discourse. You {{know that he is}} intelligent, sagacious, systematic, and determined. At first he seemed of opinion that the relief {{contained}} in the bill was so inadequate to the mass of oppression it was intended to remove, {{that it would be better}} to let it stand over, until a more perfect and better digested plan could be settled. This seemed to possess him very strongly. In order to combat this notion, and to show that the bill, all things considered, was a very great acquisition, and that it was rather a preliminary than an obstruction to relief, I ventured to show him your letter. It had its effect. He declared himself roundly against giving anything to a confederacy, real or apparent, to distress government; that, if anything was done for Catholics or Dissenters, it should be done on its own separate merits, and not by way of bargain and compromise; that they should be each of them obliged to government, not each to the other; that this would be a perpetual nursery of faction. In a word, he seemed so determined on not uniting these plans, that all I could say, and I said everything I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> was to <b>no</b> purpose. But when I insisted on the disgrace to government which must arise from their rejecting a proposition recommended by themselves, because their opposers had made a mixture, separable too by themselves, I was better heard. On the whole, I found him well disposed.|$|R

I dressed, as pale as death, I do expect, an' hurried to Jone's room, an' he an' me an' the big man was all ready in no time to go an' look for her. General Tom Thumb didn't seem very anxious, but we made him hurry up an' come along with us. We couldn't afford to leave him nowheres. The clerk down-stairs--a different one from the chap who was there the night before--said that a middle-aged, elderly lady came down about an hour before an' asked him to tell her the way to the United States Bank, an' when he told her he didn't know of any such bank, she jus' stared at him, an' wanted to know what he was put there for. So he didn't have no more to say to her, an' she went out, an' he didn't take no notice which way she went. We had the same opinion about him that Mrs. Jackson had, but we didn't stop to tell him so. We hunted up an' down the streets for an hour or more; we asked every policeman we met if he'd seen her; we went to a police station; we did everything we <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> but <b>no</b> Mrs. Jackson turned up. Then we was so tired an' hungry that we went into some place or other an' got our breakfast. When we started out ag'in, we kep' on up one street an' down another, an' askin' everybody who looked as if they had two grains of sense,--which most of 'em didn't look as if they had mor'n one, an' that was in use to get 'em to where they was goin.' At last, a little ways down a small street, we seed a crowd, an' the minute we see it Jone an' me both said in our inside hearts: 'There she is!' An' sure enough, when we got there, who should we see, with a ring of street-loafers an' boys around her, but Mrs. Andrew Jackson, with her little straw hat an' her green carpet-slippers, a-dancin' some kind of a skippin' fandango, an' a-holdin' out her skirts with the tips of her fingers. I was jus' agoin' to rush in an' grab her when a man walks quick into the ring and touches her on the shoulder. The minute I seed him I knowed him. It was our old boarder!" ...|$|R

6000|$|He {{could move}} little, and speak even less; and {{suffered}} much, both from pain and difficulty of breathing, {{as he lay}} against sacks and pillows on his bed, or sat up in an elbow chair which Mrs. Elmwood lent him. Everybody was very kind in those days of danger. Mrs. Elmwood let Rusha come on many an afternoon to help her sister, and always bringing some posset, or cordial, or dainty of some sort to tempt the invalid. Goody Grace, Mrs. Blane, Dame Oates, Nanny Pierce vied {{with each other in}} offers of sitting up with him; Andrew, the young miller, came {{out of his way to}} bring a loaf of white bread, and to fetch the corn to be ground. Peter Pierce, Rusha's lover, and more old comrades than Patience quite desired, offered their services in aiding Ben with the cattle and other necessary labours, but as the first excitement wore off, these volunteers became scantier, and when nothing was to be heard but [...] "just the same," [...] nothing to be seen but a weak, wan figure sitting wrapped by the fire, the interest waned, and the gulley was almost as little frequented as before. Poor Ben's schooling had, of course, to be given up, and it was well that he was nearly as old as Stead had been when they were first left to themselves. Happily his fifteen months of study had not made him outgrow his filial obedience and devotion to the less instructed elder brother and sister, who had taken the place of the parents he had never known. Benoni, child of sorrow, he had been named, and perhaps his sickly babyhood and the mournful times around had tended to make him a quiet boy, without the tearing spirits that would have made him eager to join the village lads in their games. Indeed they laughed at him for his poverty and scholarship, and called him Jack Presbyter, Puritan, bookworm, and all the opprobrious names they <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> though <b>no</b> one ever less merited sectarian nicknames than he, as far as doctrine went. For, bred up on Dr. Eales' books, and obliged to look out on the unsettled state of religious matters, he was as staunch a churchman as his brother, and fairly understood the foundations of his faith. Poor boy, the check to his studies disappointed him, and he spent every leisure moment over his Latin accidence or in reading. Next to the stories in the Bible, he loved the Maccabees, because of the likeness to the persecuted state of the Church; and he knew the Morte d'Arthur almost by heart, and thought it part of the history of England. Especially he loved the part that tells of the Holy Grail, the Sacred Cup that was guarded by the maimed King Pelles, and only revealed to the pure in heart and life. Stead had fully confided to him the secret of the cave, in case he should be the one left to deliver up the charge; and, in some strange way, the boy connected the treasure with the Saint Grail, and his brother with the maimed king. So he worked very hard, and Patience was capable of a good deal more than in her earlier days. Stead, helpless as he was, did not require constant attendance, and knew too well how much was on his sister's hands to trouble her when he could possibly help doing so. Thus they rubbed on; though it was a terrible winter, and they often had to break in on the hoard which was to have built the house, sometimes for needments for the patient, sometimes to hire help when there was work beyond the strength of Patience and Ben, who indeed was too slender to do all that Stead had done.|$|R
