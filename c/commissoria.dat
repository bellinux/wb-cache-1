It {{is an extraordinary}} remedy, available only if the breach is sufficiently serious or material—unless the parties have provided a cancellation clause (a lex <b>commissoria)</b> in the agreement, {{in which case the}} agreement takes precedence over common-law rules. If the breach is minor, and there is no lex <b>commissoria,</b> the innocent party can always rely on specific performance and claim for damages.|$|E

5000|$|If, in {{the absence}} of a lex <b>commissoria,</b> the breach is a major one, the court considers, in terms of common law, the nature of the breach. In Swartz & Son v Wolmaransstad the court {{examined}} the severity of the breach to ascertain whether or not it was indeed a major one. There is thus a need to interpret how important is the relevant clause to the contract. The courts take the value-judgment approach to show that there has been a breach. The test is ...|$|E
50|$|To {{determine}} {{the nature of}} the relief one party can claim on a breach of a term by the other, the terms of a contract are sometimes distinguished as either ‘material’ or ‘non-material’. Generally, {{in the absence of a}} clause that provides for cancellation (a lex <b>commissoria),</b> rescission of a contract is permissible only if the breach in question is regarded as a material breach, which is usually the case if it relates to a material (or essential or vital term)—that is, one that goes to the root of the contract. Material terms are those vital to the performance of obligations. The breach of a material term entitles the innocent party to cancel the contract. Breach of a non-material term gives rise to a claim for damages only.|$|E
50|$|Thirdly, the {{creditor}} may cancel the contract if “time {{was of the}} essence of the contract,” or was made so by a notice of rescission.” Time is of the essence when the parties expressly or impliedly agreed that default of performance by the day fixed would entitle the other party to cancel the contract. An express clause to this effect is known as a lex <b>commissoria.</b> Even in the absence of such a clause, however, the circumstances often show that the parties regard the time for performance as being of {{the essence of the}} contract: for example, where they use precise language in fixing the time, or deliberately alter the date fixed in the original draft of the contract. Time is generally of the essence of a contract in mercantile transactions, particularly in respect of commodities that fluctuate in value, but not as a rule in transactions concerning land. In all cases, however, the decisive test is the intention of the parties.|$|E
5000|$|Every rescript pre-supposes {{the truth}} of the {{allegations}} found in the supplication. Intentional falsehood or concealment of truth (obreption and subreption) renders a rescript invalid, since no one should benefit through his own deceit. According to some, however, a rescript is valid if voluntary misrepresentation affects only the secondary reason of the grant. This is certainly true where there is no fraud, but merely inadvertence or ignorance of requirements; for, where there is no malice, punishment should not be inflicted; and the petition should be granted, if a sufficient cause therefor exists. A rescript in forma <b>commissoria</b> is valid, if the reason alleged for the grant be true at the time of execution, though false when the rescript was issued. When a rescript is null and void, a new petition is drawn up containing the tenor of the previous concession and cause of nullity, and asking that the defect be remedied. A new rescript is then given, or the former one validated by letters perinde valere. If the formalities sanctioned by canon law or usage for the drawing up of rescripts are wanting, the document is considered spurious. Erasures, misspellings or grave grammatical errors in a rescript render its authenticity suspected. Excommunicated persons may seek rescripts only in relation to the cause of their excommunication or in cases of appeal. Consequently, in rescripts absolution from penalties and censures is first given, as far as necessary for the validity of the grant.|$|E
40|$|It is less {{known that}} since the Severan Dynasty the {{creditor}} {{had the opportunity to}} ask the emperor for permanent ownership over the pledged thing (impetratio dominii). It is known, however, that the protection of the debtor's interests, given that it was easier to collect taxes from them than from large land-owners, was of utmost importance for imperial finances. Therefore, apart from prohibiting the stipulation of lex <b>commissoria,</b> as well as conditioning pactum Marcianum with just price of the pledged thing, the rights of the debtor were protected by subjecting impetratio dominii to several conditions. Imperatio dominii depended on a publicly announced previous attempt of sale as well as on its annulment in case the creditor continues to collect interest after the acquisition of ownership over the pledged thing. Unsatisfied with the lack of application of these conditions in practice, Justinian posted additional conditions for the application of this institute in 530 : the obligation to attempt to sell the pledged thing within two years; to inform the debtor about it even after the expiration of this deadline, in order to give him the opportunity to pay his debt; to seek special approval of the emperor for the acquisition of ownership after the expiration of these deadlines; by introducing a subsequent possibility for the debtor to repurchase the pledge from the creditor within two years; making irreversible the creditor's ownership over the pledged thing only after the expiration of approximately four years; fair assessment of value of the pledged thing with the obligation of the creditor to return the surplus to the debtor as well as his right to request the payment of the outstanding amount from the debtor. This paper explores the emergence and evolution of imperatio dominii as well as the circumstances that lead to its emergence...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} fiduciary agreements, which, {{as a form}} of contract, that is {{the means}} of securing obligation and legal claims, are regulated by provisions of specific laws and codifications in some of the European Union countries. Even the Montenegrin legislator enacted a special law governing these legal matters, however in the Serbian law fiduciary agreements fall into the category of innominate contracts. Fiducia originates in the Roman Law and constitutes the first common form of the pledge law. The Latin term fiducia means 'trust', since these legal matters were, first of all, based on the trust between contractual parties. This paper addresses the institution of 'trust' as it is the Anglo-Saxon counterpart of the fiduciary agreement. Etymologically, 'trust' has the same meaning as the term fiducia - trust. Due to their advantages, fiduciary agreements are not even uncommon in the domestic legal practice, while there are certain, as we have already announced, theoretical, but also practical concerns arguing admissibility of this legal matter. These arguments mainly come down to the thesis (mentioned above) that entering into the fiduciary agreement results in violation of the ban on performance of contract lex <b>commissoria</b> in the pledge law. Nevertheless, I provided explanation that differences between contracts of pledge and fiduciary agreements clearly point to the conclusion that fiduciary agreements may not be treated as a pledge, hence they are admissible, that is, they are concluded on the principle of contractual freedom as an imperative norm of the Law on Obligations. Fiduciary agreements (in relation to the realistic means of security) offer to the creditor a higher level of security, reduce the period of payment of his claims, also providing practical benefits for the debtor himself. The paper presents the reasons supporting the view that it would be advantageous for the Serbian legislator, in the process of harmonization of the legislation in the field of Civil Law with the European Union law, to regulate the institute of fiduciary agreements under the special law, integrate it into the Law on Obligations or make it a part of the future Civil Code of the Republic of Serbia...|$|E

The {{author in}} the article compares legal solutions governing the commissory collection of payment of creditors whose payment is secured by pledge, i. e. of creditors of the security interest and security rights from the value of movables as secured things according to the French Civil Code, American Uniform Commercial Code, Draft Common Frame of Reference of a European Private Law {{and according to the}} Croatian law. To make analysis of the institute and to single out its characteristics the author raises following questions: a) is the creditor authorised to commissory settle his claim by law or is it presumed that such settlement was previously agreed by contracting parties; b) does the creditor have an obligation to return any amount left to the debtor after he settles his claim from the price achieved; c) what are criteria for the assessment of secured thing value; d) what about rights of other creditors, i. e. authorised persons in respect of the secured thing.
