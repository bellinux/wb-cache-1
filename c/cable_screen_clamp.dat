40|$|It is {{rare for}} modern power cables {{to use a}} solid, {{continuous}} screen in their construction. For reasons of economy and ease of construction modern <b>cables</b> increasingly use <b>screens</b> comprised of sparsely spaced conductors. The electrical relationship between a screen manufactured using this construction and the core it surrounds is markedly different {{to the relationship between}} a solid coaxial screen and the core it surrounds. The ability of a <b>cable</b> <b>screen</b> to return current during a fault situation is significantly dependent on its relationship with the core carrying the fault energy and has significant impact on the performance of the earthing systems involved. This paper examines how different the performance of the sparsely <b>screened</b> <b>cables</b> is to their solidly screened predecessors...|$|R

40|$|Transients from {{lightning}} strikes can enter underground cables at overhead line to power cable transitions. Possible overvoltages on these surges at cross-bonding connections of the <b>cable</b> <b>screens</b> are of major concern. A model is developed for modelling overvoltages from transient signal propagation through a combined cross-bonding cable and box. This model {{is applied to}} the first Dutch 400 kV cable connection. Such model incorporates model parameters whose values depend on design details of the cross-bonding box. The values for these model parameters are extracted from the measured transmission and reflection signal on steep pulses injected into the actual cross-bonding box configuration. The model combines transmission line description for the cross-bonding cables with mainly inductive behaviour of the cross-bonding box. The obtained results are verified by measurements. The model is applied to investigate overvoltages induced at the cross-bonding cable and box on 1. 2 / 50 ?s impulse voltage injection representing a lightning impulse voltage applied to the core conductor of the cross-bonding cable. Furthermore, the effectiveness of surge arresters to reduce overvoltages at the cross-bonding <b>cable</b> <b>screen</b> is demonstrated by simulations with this model in PSCAD.

5000|$|If, for example, a {{domestic}} HiFi system has a grounded turntable and a grounded preamplifier {{connected by a}} thin <b>screened</b> <b>cable</b> (or cables, in a stereo system) using phono connectors, the cross-section of copper in the <b>cable</b> <b>screen(s)</b> {{is likely to be}} less than that of the protective ground conductors for the turntable and the preamplifier. So, when a current is induced in the loop, there will be a voltage drop along the signal ground return. This is directly additive to the wanted signal, and will result in objectionable hum. For instance, if a current [...] of 1mA at the local power frequency is induced in the ground loop, and the resistance [...] of the screen of the signal cable is 100 milliohms, the voltage drop will be [...] = 100 microvolts. This is a significant fraction of the output voltage of a moving coil pickup cartridge, and a truly objectionable hum will result.|$|R
50|$|The {{moving parts}} and hinges can wear out or break. The most serious common problem arose {{because of a}} design fault in the <b>screen</b> <b>cable</b> where tooling holes caused {{unnecessary}} stressing due to additional bending of the cable at this point each time the Psion Series 5 was opened or closed and eventually leading to failure of the cable, which caused a serious display malfunction {{and the appearance of}} vertical lines on the <b>screen.</b> The <b>screen</b> <b>cable</b> to the Psion Series 5 was more durable than the <b>screen</b> <b>cable</b> of the Psion Series 5mx.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} tunnel {{installations}} of extra high voltage (EHV) power cables. Cross-bonding of the screens remains the usual earthing arrangements of cable systems, if their extension {{is greater than}} 1, 5 km approximately. Such EHV cable systems need a functional earthing along the route in correspondence of each major section, at the sending and at the receiving ends. Given the difficulties involved with the realization of these earthing systems, other techniques should be sought for. In this paper two different methods to earth the <b>cable</b> <b>screens</b> are taken into account: the former is obtained by means {{of one or more}} earth continuity conductors (ECCs), whereas the latter relies on the tunnel steel reinforcement (TSR) itself. Each method is discussed and analyzed both in terms of safety issues and stray currents...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} conduction in {{insulating materials}} {{is a complex}} process and several theories have been suggested in the literature. Many phenomenological empirical models are in use in the DC cable literature. However, the impact of using different models for cable insulation has not been investigated until now, but for the claims of relative accuracy. The steady state electric field in the DC cable insulation {{is known to be}} a strong function of DC conductivity. The DC conductivity, in turn, is a complex function of electric field and temperature. As a result, under certain conditions, the stress at <b>cable</b> <b>screen</b> is higher than that at the conductor boundary. The paper presents detailed investigations on using different empirical conductivity models suggested in the literature for HV DC cable applications. It has been expressly shown that certain models give rise to erroneous results in electric field and temperature computations. It is pointed out that the use of these models in the design or evaluation of cables will lead to errors...|$|R

50|$|The {{best way}} to wire {{shielded}} <b>cables</b> for <b>screening</b> is to ground the shield {{at both ends of}} the cable.

40|$|In {{order to}} detect and locate partial {{discharge}} (PD) activity within HV cables and in particular cable joints, the feasibility of using a very high frequency (VHF) capacitive coupler technique has been investigated. In addition, an alternative PD off-line test method for cable joints or cable sections within long cable systems has been developed. By energising the joint or a short section of the <b>cable</b> <b>screen</b> only this method {{has the advantage of}} reducing the power supply requirement of the test source. The application of capacitive couplers for this PD off-line test method has been investigated. In order to use this approach there must be an insulation gap between the coupler and the outer sheath of the test cable. The effect of this gap on measured sensitivity has been investigated experimentally and {{through the use of a}} simulation model. Obtained results are in good agreement. Cross-correlation techniques have been implemented to automatically estimate the signal time of flight from different coupler outputs. Methods of calibrating the coupler applied to the alternative PD off-line test method have also been investigated...|$|R

50|$|In digital systems, which {{commonly}} transmit data serially (RS232, RS485, USB, Firewire, DVI, HDMI etc) {{the signal}} voltage is often {{much larger than}} induced power frequency AC on the connecting <b>cable</b> <b>screens,</b> but different problems arise. Of those protocols listed, only RS232 is single-ended with ground return, {{but it is a}} large signal, typically + and - 12V, all the others being differential. Simplistically, the big problem with the differential protocols is that with slightly mismatched capacitance from the hot and cold wires to ground, or slightly mismatched hot and cold voltage swings or edge timing, the currents in the hot and cold wires will be unequal, and also a voltage will be coupled onto the signal screen, which will cause a circulating current at signal frequency and its harmonics, extending up to possibly many GHz. The difference in signal current magnitudes between the hot and cold conductors will try to flow from, for example, item A's protective ground conductor back to a common ground in the building, and back along item B's protective ground conductor. This may involve a large loop area and cause significant radiation, violating EMC regulations and causing interference to other equipment.|$|R
40|$|Power cable {{terminations}} {{are widely used}} in power system networks for a last few decades. A proper design of cable termination is essential in reducing the electric field distribution {{around the end of}} high voltage cable. At the termination of cable, the electric field was usually the highest, for the insulation layer was cut in this place. And with the high electric field at the cutting point, there were surely partial discharge occurs. In order to overcome this issue, some sorts of method were proposed. Stress control geometry method and non-linear properties of Zinc Oxide Microvaristor method have been used in this research. The aim was to find an optimal solution for the electric field distribution. An 11 kV power cable has been modelled for this study by using Finite Elements Method (FEM) computational solution. The model has been used to simulate the electric field distribution in the cable termination. The structure of terminations and the critical parts in this design were also defined through literature. A non-linear grading has been applied to several design of layer insulation. The proposed model was used to covers the point that generate high fields at <b>screen</b> <b>cable</b> insulation. Material properties {{play a key role in}} suppresses electric field spread throughout termination area. Based on the switching point of about 1 kV/cm the material changes its conductivity significantly. In this way it prevents the occurrence of electric fields which are above this switching point. Different thicknesses also were introduced to get a better design and economically to produce in cost advantages. This research successfully examines the effectiveness for both methods in controlling field stress at <b>cable</b> <b>screen</b> termination...|$|R

40|$|During a study {{performed}} in {{framework of a}} European Space Agency contract, the vulnerability of spacecraft harnesses has been assessed. The harnesses consisted of three different space-grade cable types: power <b>cables,</b> <b>screened</b> twisted pair data cables and radio frequency (RF) cables. They were alternately shielded by {{two different types of}} representative spacecraft structure walls. Ten hypervelocity impact (HVI) tests at 0 degrees incidence have been performed with impact velocities ranging from 6. 4 km/s to 7. 7 km/s. Projectiles have been aluminium spheres with diameters ranging from 1. 5 mm to 4. 0 mm. During the tests, all cables were operated at their representative conditions and the disturbances, induced by the impacts, were measured. The malfunction observed could be related to two physical failure mechanisms: (1) short circuits caused by a conducting cloud of molten and evaporated aluminium and, for the data cables, (2) strands being bent by impacting fragments creating a short circuit between <b>screen</b> and signal <b>cable.</b> The influence of a more complex structure wall to the failure mechanism in (1) is shown. Malfunction was dependent on mechanical damage, but no clear correlation between severity of malfunction and mechanical damage could be established.

40|$|Continual {{advances}} {{are being}} made in the control and monitoring of subsea oil wells by the application of new technology for sensors, subsea processing and communications devices. With these advances, the demands on the subsea umbilical are constantly increasing with deployment lengths and depths growing and the quantity of controlled functions now greater than ever. The need for {{a good understanding of}} the effects of deployment subsea is essential, as communications frequencies and data throughput constantly increase. This research aims to address some of the issues regarding umbilical modelling and sets up a series of tests to measure the effects of pressure and cable flooding within the umbilical and assesses the effect of steel tubes, hydraulic hoses and cable armouring on the operating parameters of the cables. In addition, the cables are modelled using electromagnetic field solver tools and the results compared with those measured. Once prediction losses have been established, these are compared with measurements taken on the full lengths of umbilical and the reasons for any discrepancies examined. It is shown that, in a typical subsea umbilical, the proximity of conducting cores to adjacent components, such as hydraulic hoses or steel wire armour, the flooding with sea water and the pressure due to the depth of deployment all {{have a significant impact on}} the impedance parameters of the cables. The effect of <b>cable</b> <b>screening</b> on attenuation is also examined and it is shown that, as well as affecting capacitance and conductance, the screen has a significant impact on the cable resistance and inductance, with the resistance rising to a maximum at a certain screen thickness before a subsequent reduction. This effect was investigated further by modelling with an electromagnetic field solver and a possible explanation for this effect is proposed. Comparison of the modelled data and measurement of cables under the various operating conditions investigated show good correlation with the results, allowing very accurate prediction of the effects on electrical performance of cables when deployed subsea in Subsea Control System umbilicals...|$|R
