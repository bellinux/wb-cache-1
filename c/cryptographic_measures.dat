Circuits designed in deep submicron technologies are susceptible to variation in process. The variability may affect the circuit performance, power and reliability. Numerous pre-silicon design methodologies and post-silicon circuit tuning mechanisms have been proposed in literature. We propose a hybrid self-detection and calibration technique based on algorithmic post processing and circuit tuning to mitigate the effects of variability. Results show that variation in fabrication process and varying on-chip temperature affect the reliability of these circuits. On employing the proposed self calibration technique in 45 nm technology, an improvement of close to 4 X in the bit entropy is seen {{across a range of}} 10 % intra-die variation.

40|$|The {{correlation}} immunity {{is known}} as an important <b>cryptographic</b> <b>measure</b> of a Boolean function with respect to its resist against the correlation attack. This paper generalizes the concept of correlation immunity to be of a fractional value, called fractional correlation immunity, which is a fraction between 0 and 1, and correlation immune function is the extreme case when the fractional correlation immunity is 1. However when a function is not correlation immune in the traditional sense, it may also has a nonzero fractional correlation immunity, which also indicates {{the resistance of the}} function against correlation attack. This paper first shows how this generalized concept of fractional correlation immunity is a reasonable measure on the resistance against the correlation attack, then studies the fractional correlation immunity of a special class of Boolean functions, i. e. majority functions, of which the subset of symmetric ones have been proved to have highest algebraic immunity. This paper shows that all the majority functions, including the symmetric ones and the non-symmetric ones, are not correlation immune.

We use physical layer security to guarantee non-zero secrecy rate in single source, single destination multi-hop networks with eavesdroppers for two cases: when eavesdropper locations and channel gains are known and when their positions are unknown. We propose a two-phase solution which consists of finding activation sets and then obtaining transmit powers subject to SINR constraints for the case when eavesdropper locations are known. We introduce methods to find activation sets and compare their performance. Necessary but reasonable approximations are made in power minimization formulations for tractability reasons. For scenarios with no eavesdropper location information, we suggest vulnerability region (the area having zero secrecy rate) minimization over the network.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present an}} {{authentication}} device {{allowing for the}} validation of wireless transmissions {{by means of a}} watermark signal applied at the physical layer, and demonstrate how the method may be applied to digital broadcast television signals. The novel watermarking approach presented conveys the authentication signal through explicit emulation of innocuous channel responses, further preventing Primary User Emulation attacks in Dynamic Spectrum Access theaters. The undesirable effects of the watermark signal design are removed by the receiver by traditional channel equalization practices, resulting in nearly zero impact to the bit error rate (BER) of the primary signal received. The proposed mechanism may be implemented without modification to existing Digital Television (DTV) transmission equipment using a retrofitting approach, and does not require the modification of existing receivers or protocols. A key benefit of the proposed method is that the authentication signal may be received at a BER much lower than the primary-signal, all within original transmission power and bandwidth constraints.

Typically these attacks depend on the attacker knowing the characteristics of the algorithm, as well as (some) inputs. In this setting, blinding serves to alter the algorithm's input into some unpredictable state. Depending on the characteristics of the blinding function, this can prevent some or all leakage of useful information.

With an adversary trying to mislead nodes about their estimated locations, several approaches aiming to defeat attackers by means of robustness instead of <b>cryptographic</b> <b>measures</b> have been proposed in the past.

40|$|The article {{describes}} {{an attack on}} OpenPGP format, which leads to disclosure of the private signature keys of the DSA and RSA algorithms. The OpenPGP format is used {{in a number of}} applications including PGP, GNU Privacy Guard and other programs specified on the list of products compatible with OpenPGP, which is available at [URL] Therefore all these applications must undergo the same revision as the actual program PGP TM. The success of the attack was practically verified and demonstrated on the PGP TM program, version 7. 0. 3 with a combination of AES and DH/DSS algorithms. As the private signature key is the basic information of the whole system which is kept secret, it is encrypted using the strong cipher. However, it shows that this protection is illusory, as the attacker has neither to attack this cipher nor users secret passphrase. A modification of the private key file in a certain manner and subsequent capturing of one signed message is sufficient for successful attack. Insufficient protection of the integrity of the public as well as private parts of signature keys in the OpenPGP format is analyzed in DSA and RSA algorithms and on the basis of this, a procedure of attacks is shown on both private signature keys. The attacks apply to all lengths of parameters (modules, keys) of RSA and DSA.

40|$|Abstract — Mandatory Human Participation (MHP) {{is a novel}} {{authentication}} scheme that asks the question “are you human?” (instead of “who are you?”), and upon the correct answer to this question, can prove a principal {{to be a human}} being instead of a computer program. MHP helps solve old and new problems in computer security that existing security measures can not address properly, including password (or PIN number) guessing attacks and application-level denial of service. A key component of this “are you human? ” authentication process is a character morphing algorithm that transforms a character string into its graphical form {{in such a way that}} a human being won’t have any problem recognizing the original string, while a computer program (e. g., an Optical Character Recognition program), will not be able to decipher it or make a correct guess with nonnegligible probability. The basic idea of the MHP scheme is to ask an agent to recognize the string before its login attempts or transaction requests can be honored. Here a protocol is needed to send a puzzle to an agent, check if the answer supplied by the agent is correct, and most importantly make sure that the agent can not cheat in the process. A number of system and security issues that relate to the protocol need to be addressed for the protocol to be secure, efficient, robust, and user-friendly. The MHP scheme contributes to the foundation of the computer security by faithfully implementing a novel security semantics, “human, ” which existing <b>cryptographic</b> <b>measures</b> can not express accurately. As many real-world security applications involve the interaction between a human and a computer, which naturally contains “human ” as a part of its protocol semantics, we believe that the MHP scheme will find many new applications in the future.

40|$|Mobility in {{conjunction}} with communication facilities {{in the form of}} mobile telephony seems {{to be one of the}} major technology trends observed throughout the last decade. Many experts and analysts expect that the arrival of mobile services such as mobile commerce, location-based services, multi-media messaging, and mobile gaming in the third generation of mobile networks will be the next step in this success story. However, protecting service providers from fraud and mobile users from new threats such as identity theft or other attacks on privacy and security matters is equally challenging. Historically, cryptography has been used to protect information in the digital world from eavesdropping or tampering. In future person-to-person and person-to-service interaction scenarios cryptography will be of at least equal importance. However, the situation today is not people-centric but more application-centric, i. e. for each application new security measures are defined and implemented. As an example one may just consider that almost any access control in the Internet is managed through simple account/password schemes different for each application. But passwords are known to be a generally weak security measure in many practical settings. From the user perspective the account/password approach additionally leads to numerous login accounts an individual has to manage - something which is inconvenient and as a consequence often error-prone. <b>Cryptographic</b> <b>measures</b> can be applied but shifting towards such mechanisms especially in mobile settings is often hard to implement since people cannot easily carry around their personal cryptographic keys, let alone memorize them or input them when needed. Therefore, we believe that some kind of personal security assistant or device is needed that safely keeps a user's security-sensitive data and enforces the user's security-related interests. Otherwise, people will be forced to use traditional weak protection mechanisms that are applicable without strong <b>cryptographic</b> <b>measures</b> - a situation we do not think is desirable in the digital age of tomorrow. Smartcards are devices that could be used to solve at least some of the problems mentioned. They are tamper-resistant, can safely store information, are able to perform unobserved (cryptographic) operations, and can be conveniently carried around. As such they seem to be ideal candidates for personal security modules. However, it is yet unclear how smartcards can be empowered to actually play the role of true personal and ubiquitous security modules. Furthermore, the smartcard alone is not sufficient to act as a security module since it lacks reasonable user interfaces such as a display and input facilities. Thus, suitable terminals are needed that allow users to communicate with their smartcards, i. e. personal security modules are comprised of suitable terminals and personalized smartcards that work together in order to fulfill the users' needs. Henceforth, this thesis will contribute approaches, architectures, protocols, and systems how smartcards can be put in place to become true security modules for people in the digital age. The most visible contributions of this thesis are as follows: The JiniCard framework for the integration of off-the-shelf smartcards into local environments. It enables smartcards that have traditionally played the role of passive servers to become truely active entities after they are inserted into suitably configured card terminals. Users could carry around their smartcard, insert them into available readers and make immediate use of their security services. The approach is centered around the idea to dynamically instantiate ``software substitutes'' for resource-limited devices such as smartcards. The so-called Personal Card Assistant approach solving the problem of smartcard usage in a ``hostile'' environment. It is comprised of an off-the-shelf personalized user terminal - such as a PDA - that cooperates with a personal smartcard. The personal terminal is used instead of terminals considered to be public, i. e. it acts as a ``trust amplifier'' for its user. The advantage is that mobile users communicate with their smartcard through their own mobile terminal which they possibly consider much more trustworthy than other unknown components. The personal terminal and the smartcard are linked together using <b>cryptographic</b> <b>measures</b> such that no device is usable without the other. The WebSIM system that integrates into the Internet the SIM smartcards found in all GSM mobile phones. In this approach people now can use mobile phones as ``wireless smartcard readers'' which are reachable from the Internet by means of a small HTTP Web server implemented in the SIM. This approach allows among others to perform security-critical operations such as authentication to be initiated from a remote context, e. g. from an Internet shop. Hence, smartcards become Internet nodes that encapsulate security services a mobile user offers to peers. The SIMspeak platform allowing for the execution of mobile code within a smartcard. This approach was motivated by the need for end-to-end secure communication between a service provider and its customer and the ability to easily create electronic signatures on small devices. It allows a service provider to ``rent'' persistent storage on a user's personal smartcard, e. g. to store cryptographic keys used to send end-to-end encrypted mobile code from the provider to the user's smartcard. The smartcard then becomes the most active component in a personal security module and uses available terminals to communicate with its user. This approach essentially shifts as much security-critical components and computations as possible from less trustworthy components into the secure context of the smartcard. This approach leads to new trust models for smartcard issuers which can be particularly well applied in the context of electronic signature creation in mobile scenarios. These results can be used independently from each other but equally well composed into more general security solutions. As such they can be considered as building blocks enabling the composition of suitable personal security modules meeting the personal security demands of the future. Summing up, this thesis provides solutions to the question how smartcards can become true personal security modules. It does this by proposing concrete architectures and protocols all of which have been prototypically implemented to yield meaningful proofs-of-concepts...|$|E
40|$|Information {{technology}} {{has given rise}} to the problem of controlling the use of copyrighted works of authorship from their unauthorized use. In this context, one of the effective solutions is the application of technological protection measures, which are aimed at a more efficient application of the protection measures prescribed by the law. Technological protection measures imply the use of any technology, device or component which may be aimed at preventing or restricting an unauthorized use of a protected work of authorship, which has not been approved by the author or holder of some related right. Generally, all these measures may be classified into three basic groups: technological measures aimed at controlling access, technological measured aimed at controlling exploitation, and technological measures aimed at protecting the integrity of the work of authorship. Considering their technical characteristics and mode of application, they may be hardware-based measures, software-based measures, or a combination thereof. Modern {{technology has}} enabled the development of digital systems which entail a controlled use of copyrighted works and facilitate obtaining licences for their exploitation. They are commonly known as digital rights management (DRM). The DRM system should provide for a compromise between safeguarding the intellectual property rights of the copyright holder, the end user privacy, and system costs. The envisaged goals are achieved by employing various <b>cryptographic</b> <b>measures.</b> The process of developing technological protection measures is accompanied by concurrent attempts to circumvent the application of these measures. Thus, the effectiveness of these measures primarily depends on their legal protection, which has been recognized by a vast majority of legal systems, we now know the most modern legal system. However, the normative solutions are not uniform. The observed differences actually reflect problems in finding adequate forms of protection, which mostly stem from the fact that sanctions for evasion of technological measures call into question the ultimate purpose of copyright law in general. Yet, the regulation of technological protection measures must be approached with great caution. Envisaging relevant legal protection for these measures should contribute to providing a comprehensive and stable system of copyright protection.

40|$|WirelessHART is {{the first}} open {{standard}} for Wireless Sensor Networks designed specifically for industrial process automation and control systems. WirelessHART is a secure protocol; however, it relies on a Security Manager {{for the management of}} the security keys and the authentication of new devices. The WirelessHART standard does not provide specifications and design of the Security Manager. Also, the security specifications in the standard are not well organized and are dispersed throughout the standard. The lack of Security Manager design and ambiguous security specifications impede implementation of the standard since it requires close knowledge of all the core specifications {{on the part of the}} developer. In this paper we provide the detailed specifications, design, and implementation of the Security Manager for the WirelessHART standard. We evaluate our Security Manager against different <b>cryptographic</b> algorithms and <b>measure</b> the latency between the Network Manager and the Security Manager. Our evaluation shows that the proposed Security Manager meets the WirelessHART requirements. Our analysis shows that the provided Security Manager is capable of securing both the wireless and wired part of the WirelessHART network...|$|R

40|$|Cryptography is {{the science}} of using {{mathematics}} to encrypt and decrypt data. Cryptography enables you to store sensitive information or transmit it across insecure networks (like the Internet) so that it cannot be read by anyone except the intended recipient. <b>Cryptographic</b> strength is <b>measured</b> in the time and resources it would require to recover the plaintext. The result of strong cryptography is cipher text that {{is very difficult to}} decipher without possession of the appropriate decoding tool. A cryptographic algorithm, or cipher, is a mathematical function used in the encryption and decryption process. A cryptographic algorithm works in combination with a key — a word, number, or phrase — to encrypt the plaintext. The same plaintext encrypts to different cipher text with different keys. The security of encrypted data is entirely dependent on two things: the strength of the cryptographic algorithm and the secrecy of the key. With growing dependencies on secure information transfer and data security in this information age the requirement for a strong method of securing data is always in demand. In this project, we have tried to device a new means of securing data by encryption and decryption in GF(13). The reason for using GF(13) is that much research has been done on GF(2) but the GF(13) field is still mostly untouched. Hence there is much scope for designing versatile techniques which will be both secure and faster. This will again reduce the probability of anonymous decryption by undesirable agents. Such technique can be the future of data security with wide application in every field starting with military application, internet security, wireless data transfer and many more. ...|$|R
