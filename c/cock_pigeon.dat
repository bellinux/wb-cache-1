In his {{military}} service, {{he was also}} known by his service number NPS.42.31066. [...] His early missions saw him carrying messages out of occupied Belgium for the resistance.|$|E
50|$|Male {{and female}} <b>pigeons</b> (<b>cocks</b> and hens, respectively) can be {{differentiated}} by physical {{characteristics of the}} head, beak, height, and breast, though visual identification of sex by physical characteristics alone can be inaccurate. Males usually stand taller, and have larger beaks, crops, wattles, and eye ceres (fleshy growth around the eyes), as well as round heads and thicker napes. Females, on the other hand, tend to be shorter with smaller beaks, wattles, and ceres, as well as flatter heads and fuller breasts.|$|R
5000|$|There {{is plenty}} of land and water fowl in this isle—as hawks, eagles of two kinds (the one grey and of a larger size, the other much less and black, but more {{destructive}} to young cattle), black <b>cock,</b> heath-hen, plovers, <b>pigeons,</b> wild geese, ptarmigan, and cranes. Of this latter sort I have seen sixty on the shore in a flock together. The sea fowls are malls of all kinds—coulterneb, guillemot, sea cormorant, &c. The natives observe that the latter, if perfectly black, makes no good broth, nor is its flesh worth eating; but that a cormorant, which hath any white feathers or down, makes good broth, and the flesh of it is good food; and the broth is usually drunk by nurses to increase their milk.

50|$|Much {{was done}} in getting the French {{settlers}} established. Allotments were laid out for them {{to the west of}} the stream where they had landed, in what is now known as the French town. As enough open land on the foreshore could not be found at all, the six Germans were allotted sections on the next bay to the west, now known as Takamatua, but until 1915 was called German Bay. The total area of the land taken up under the Nanto-Bordelaise Company at this time was 107 acre. Although they had no animals, the colonists were able to plant and prepare their gardens. In the following year de Belligny obtained four working bullocks from Sydney. Vegetable seeds and a number of young fruit trees — apples, pears, mulberry and nuts — as well as grape vines, had survived the voyage from France. Although Lavaud mentions that the ‘menagerie’ placed on board the Aube at Brest included not only the cattle, but geese, turkey <b>cocks</b> and hens, <b>pigeons</b> and even rabbits, it is not clear whether any of these survived.|$|R
