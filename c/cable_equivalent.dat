40|$|A {{simulation}} model is presented which investigates the dynamic response {{of a deep}} mine hoisting cable system during a winding cycle. The response, namely the lateral motions of the catenary cable and the longitudinal motion of the vertical rope with conveyance is observed on the fast time scale, and the slow time scale is introduced to monitor the variation of slowly varying parameters of the system. The <b>cable</b> <b>equivalent</b> proportional damping parameters, and periodic excitation functions resulting from the cross-over cable motion on the winder drum are identified. Subsequently, the model is solved numerically using parameters of a double-drum multi-rope system. Since the system eigenvalues are widely spread {{and the problem is}} of stiff nature, the numerical simulation is conducted using a stiff solver. The results of the simulation demonstrate various transient non-linear resonance phenomena arising in the system during the wind. The nominal ascending cycle simulation results reveal adverse dynamic behaviour of the catenary largely due to the autoparametric interactions between the in- and out-of-plane modes. Principal parametric resonances of the lateral modes also occur, and conditions for autoparametric interactions between the lateral and longitudinal modes arise. Additionally, a transition through a number of primary longitudinal resonances takes place during the wind. The adverse dynamic motions in the system promote large oscillations in the cable tension which must be considered significant with respect to fatigue of the cable. It is noted that a small change in the winding velocity may cause large changes in the dynamic response due to the resonance region shifts. Consequently, the resonance modal interactions can be avoided, to a large extent, if the winding velocity is increased to an appropriate level. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} study {{focuses on the}} dielectric response of XLPE model power cables that have combinations of homo- and co-polymer insulation with furnace and acetylene carbon black semicon shields. Three dielectric spectroscopy techniques, which are frequency response analyzer and transformer ratio bridge in both frequency domain, and charging/discharging current system in time domain, were jointly {{used to measure the}} low loss XLPE cables in the frequency range from 10 - 4 Hz to 104 Hz at temperatures from 20 °C to 80 °C. Degassing effects and thermal ageing effects have also been studied with the spectroscopy techniques. Thermal-electric behaviour and maximum voltages for thermal breakdown have been theoretically simulated for the model cables. Three loss origins of the XLPE cables have been found with different loss mechanisms. Conduction loss due to thermally activated electron/hole hopping dominates the lower frequency range from 10 - 4 Hz to 1 Hz; Semicon loss due to its in series resistance with the insulation layer in <b>cable</b> <b>equivalent</b> circuit dominates the higher frequency range from 102 Hz to 104 Hz; intrinsic polarization loss of the XLPE insulation has dominant flat loss spectra in the mid-frequency range from 1 Hz to 102 Hz. Degassing was found to decrease the conductivity of the model cables, while thermal ageing greatly increased the conductivity. Thermal-electric simulation results with FEMLAB have shown that the position of maximum field changes from inner to outer insulation boundary under higher applied voltages. A loss mechanism model with mathematical expression for dielectric loss spectrum calculation is finally proposed to explain the total dielectric loss of polymer power cables.

To address this issue, we analyzed a likely mechanism underlying plateaus in three representations of a reconstructed PC with increasing complexity. Analysis in an infinite cable suggests that Ca plateaus triggered by direct excitatory inputs from parallel fibers and their mirror signals, valleys (putatively triggered by the local feed forward inhibitory network), cannot propagate. However, simulations of the model in electrotonic <b>equivalent</b> <b>cables</b> prove that Ca plateaus (resp. valleys) are conducted over the entire cell with velocities typical of passive events once they are triggered by threshold synaptic inputs that turn the membrane current inward (resp. outward) over the whole cell surface.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{investigation}} and implementation of novel techniques for the design of X band (8 - 12 GHz) power amplifiers. One of the main topics is the expansion and novel implementation of continuous mode theory, with the intention of improving the bandwidth and efficiency of X band power amplifiers. This work builds upon the Class B/J continuous mode theory to incorporate cases where <[ZF 0] 6 = RL, not described by the original Class B/J theory, with a tool called the “clipping contour”. The clipping contour tool shows a graphical representation on the Smith chart of the boundary between impedances generating a voltage waveform which will modulate or “clip” the current waveform, and a voltage waveform which will leave the current waveform unaltered. This non-clipping space is shown, with measured load pull and amplifier data, to represent the maximum efficiency case for a given ZF 0, thus the clipping contour tool thus gives designers the ability to predict the areas of highest efficiency and power given any ZF 0, without the need to use costly, time consuming multi harmonic load pull techniques. Push pull amplifiers using quarter wave coupled line baluns are proposed as an ideal matching topology to exploit this new tool. Various balun topologies are studied using a novel extended transmission line model. This model is shown to predict accurately and explain the “trace separation” effect seen in planar baluns and not their 3 D coaxial <b>cable</b> <b>equivalents.</b> It also forms the basis of analysis which results in a powerful new equation capable of guaranteeing the elimination of trace separation completely, without compromising performance.

40|$|Two {{statistical}} {{techniques are}} developed {{to predict the}} statistical moments of the horizontal motion of a floating moored dock, known as catenary anchor leg mooring (CALM), loaded by hydrodynamic random forces. The dock is represented by a lumped mass, the mooring <b>cables</b> by <b>equivalent</b> nonlinear springs and the hydrodynamic forces are modelled by a modified Morison equation. The model of the floating dock leads to a nonlinear ordinary differential equation. Although the problem could be approached by a direct numerical integration, e. g. by Monte-Carlo simulations, because of the stochastic nature of the excitation, this would imply {{a large number of}} runs to produce results of some statistical significance. In the present paper an alternative solution is based on the development of two more efficient techniques to predict the relevant statistical moments of the dock response.

We examined age-related morphological alterations in 2 types of pyramidal neurons contributing to working memory circuits in the macaque prefrontal cortex (PFC) : neurons in the superior temporal cortex forming “long” projections to the PFC and “local” projection neurons within the PFC. Global dendritic mass homeostasis, measured by 3 -dimensional scaling analysis, was conserved with aging in both neuron types.

Finally, the individual and combined effects of concrete creep, concrete shrinkage and cable relaxation on the long-term behaviour of a prestressed concrete frame are studied. It is found that the proposed relaxation model and the time marching method can provide a reliable method for time-dependent analysis. The results obtained indicate that the interactions among these factors should be considered carefully in analyzing long-term behaviour of concrete structures. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 7 th International Conference on Tall Buildings (ICTB- 7), Hong Kong, China, 29 - 30 October 2009.
