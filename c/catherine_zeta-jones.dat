5|$|Drama in {{the early}} 20th century thrived, but the country failed to produce a Welsh National Theatre company. After the Second World War the {{substantial}} number of amateur companies that had existed before the outbreak of hostilities reduced by two thirds. The increasing competition from television in the 1950s and 1960s led to a need for greater professionalism in the theatre. As a result, plays by Emlyn Williams and Alun Owen and others were staged, while Welsh actors, including Richard Burton, Rachel Roberts, Donald Houston and Stanley Baker, were establishing themselves as artistic talents. Anthony Hopkins was an alumnus of the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama, and has since starred in Hollywood films.John Rhys-Davies is another well known actor, famous for his portrayal of Gimli in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the charismatic Arab excavator Sallah in the Indiana Jones films. Other Welsh actors to have crossed the Atlantic more recently include: Ioan Gruffudd; Rhys Ifans; Matthew Rhys; Michael Sheen; and <b>Catherine</b> <b>Zeta-Jones.</b>|$|E

Lawrence of the San Diego Union Tribune commented, [...] "It was a frustratingly average, three-hour-12-minute exhibition of mutual admiration in the inimitable Hollywood style." [...] He later said that despite Rock's edgy and provocative opening, his humor and energy diminished as the night wore on. Vince Horiuchi of The Salt Lake Tribune wrote of Rock's [...] performance, [...] "He was bound by stale jokes (none of the winners [...] "tested positive for steroids"), a rigid opening monologue (he didn't even make reference to his prior controversial comments about the Oscars), and tired comedy bits (Rock playing like <b>Catherine</b> <b>Zeta-Jones</b> with Adam Sandler)." [...] In addition, he also described the cast and production of the ceremony as [...] "moribund" [...] and [...] "clumsy." ...|$|E
500|$|Antonio Banderas as Alejandro Murrieta / Zorro: Despite {{claims made}} by several media outlets and Antonio Banderas, Banderas {{was not the}} first Spanish actor to portray Zorro.

Banderas was paid $5 million for the role. The {{character}} of Alejandro Murrieta was conceived as the fictional brother of the real-life Joaquin Murrieta, making the character either Mexican or Chilean. To prepare for his role, Banderas practiced with the Olympic fencing team in Spain for four months, before studying additional fencing and swordsmanship with Anthony Hopkins and <b>Catherine</b> <b>Zeta-Jones.</b> The three were trained by Bob Anderson during pre-production in Mexico, spending 10 hours a day for two months specifically on fight scenes from the film. [...] "We used to call him Grumpy Bob on the set, he was such a perfectionist," [...] director Martin Campbell reflected. [...] "He was incredibly inventive, and also refused to treat any of the actors as stars.
