40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} load cell moving deformable barrier (LCMDB) tests as a means of assessing frontal impact <b>compatibility</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicles.</b> An LCMDB is employed to enable assessment of relevant partner-protection characteristics in addition to self-protection performance in a front-to-front crash test. The ability to control key characteristics of compatibility in LCMDB tests enables force measurements on the load cell wall to be used to assess structural interaction, frontal force level and passenger compartment strength. In this study, LCMDB tests have been conducted with various deformable elements to determine how well they correlated with fixed barrier tests or vehicle-to-vehicle tests. Firstly, barrier load cell data measured in a full-frontal LCMDB-to-vehicle crash test are compared with data measured in a full width deformable barrier (FWDB) test at 56 km/h. In addition, some compatibility metrics such as average height of force (AHOF) and force distribution are compared. Secondly, an offset-frontal LCMDB-to-vehicle crash test has been conducted to evaluate the passenger compartment strength for small cars in an overload condition. Force measurements of the load cell wall are compared with data obtained from an offset deformable barrier (ODB) test at 64 km/h. Finally, an oblique-frontal LCMDB-to-vehicle crash test has been conducted and the test results are compared with vehicle-to-vehicle tests and with fixed oblique barrier tests at 50 km/h in terms of the vehicle and occupant kinematics. The study has shown that the LCMDB-to-vehicle test offers a realistic simulation of the effect of differences in mass in vehicle-to-vehicle impacts, and enables compatibility metrics to be evaluated...|$|E
40|$|While frontal {{collisions}} between Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) {{and passenger}} cars are rare compared to car-to-car frontal crashes, {{they are much}} more severe. Between 43 % and 73 % of all frontal car-to-truck accidents result in fatalities. The severity is due to crash incompatibility between the vehicles that has been generally agreed to arise from differences in mass, stiffness and geometry and it refers not only to car-to-truck collisions but also to most vehicle-to-vehicle collisions. To address incompatibilities between passenger cars and HGVs, Front Underrun Protective Devices (FUPDs) are obligatory equipment for HGVs produced after August 2003. To date, there is insufficient research describing the efficiency of statutory and energy absorbing (e. a.) FUPDs in real traffic collisions. The aim of the research presented in this thesis is to understand and suggest improvements for the compatibility between trucks and passenger cars through parametric studies of different design and collision configurations where the compatibility between trucks and cars is seen as an indivisible part of overall crash <b>compatibility</b> <b>between</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The focus was the requirements for energy absorbing FUPDs to overcome the unpredictable behaviour of passenger cars in frontal collisions by studying the links between geometry and stiffness as influenced by crash configuration and structural interaction. The bending stiffness of e. a. FUPD cross-beams, their height, and triggering force for energy absorbing elements were found to be important characteristics of e. a. FUPD that influence the outcome in collisions between HGVs and passenger cars. The stable response of vehicle structures was identified as an important issue to understand. A new analysis approach, called the RED method, was developed and presented. Using energy absorption and impact forces calculated in FE simulations, the RED method gives more insight into structural deformation processes than other methods and thereby improves the evaluation of vehicle structures. Information derived from the procedure was used to develop two new assessment criteria - Structural Efficiency and Crash Stability â€“ {{that can be used to}} objectively quantify the crash response of vehicles. Because the method is based on FE crash simulations it can be used in the development as well as production phase of a vehicle crash structure or even other structures where deformation modes are important. It was shown that these criteria can be used in compatibility rating where a new perspective on compatibility is introduced and applied...|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} for the dynamic {{analysis}} of the vertical vehicle-structure interaction is presented. The vehicle and structure systems can be discretized with various types of finite elements and may have any degree of complexity. The equations of both systems are complemented with additional compatibility equations to ensure contact <b>between</b> the <b>vehicles</b> and the structure. The equations of motion and the compatibility equations form a single system that is solved directly, thus avoiding the iterative procedure used by other authors to satisfy the <b>compatibility</b> <b>between</b> the <b>vehicle</b> and structure. For large structural systems the proposed method is usually more efficient than those that frequently update and factorize the system matrix.

40|$|AbstractFor the {{assessment}} of vehicle safety in frontal collisions, the crash <b>compatibility</b> <b>between</b> the colliding <b>vehicles</b> is crucial. Compatibility compromises both the self protection and the partner protection properties of vehicles. Although compatibility has received worldwide attention for many years, no final assessment approach has been defined. Within the FIMCAR project, different frontal impact test procedures are analysed regarding their potential for future frontal impact legislation. The research activities focus on car-to-car frontal impact accidents based on accident investigations involving newer cars. Test procedures were developed with both a crash test programme and numerical simulations. The proposal from FIMCAR {{is to use a}} full width test procedure with deformable element and compatibility metrics in combination with the current ECE R 94 off-set procedure as a frontal impact assessment approach which also addresses compatibility...|$|R
40|$|Roadside {{accidents}} cause {{a significant}} number of fatalities each year in the world. To reduce this type of accident, roadside infrastructure needs to be investigated to improve protection to different kinds of passenger vehicles during crashes. Accident statistics have revealed ditches and guardrails as the two main roadside safety features that reduce fatal injury risks. Guardrails were chosen for this investigation. Geometric and structural <b>compatibility</b> in collisions <b>between</b> <b>vehicles</b> and guardrails were studied to find ways to improve roadside safety. Two studies on this type of crash compatibility were conducted using the computer simulation tool LS-DYNA. Full-scale crash tests were compared with the simulation results for validation. A compact car and a W-beam guardrail were chosen for a study of their interaction during oblique collisions. The goal was to investigate the influence of vertical position and stiffness of the main crashworthy structures in a vehicle of a constant mass during an oblique crash with a W-beam guardrail. The simulation showed good agreement with a full-scale crash test. Using validated models, a parameter study for the geometric <b>compatibility</b> <b>between</b> passenger <b>vehicles</b> and road barriers was carried out. This study concluded that the cross members of a vehicle must be stiff. A laterally weak vehicle is likely to be more severely damaged, with higher risk of injury. Moreover, a more deformed guardrail and a less deformed vehicle body are positive results, as shown by lower impact severity parameters. The influence of wheel impacts with a post was not included in this first study. In a second study, a flared guardrail terminal was modelled and two vehicle models were modified to simulate an oblique impact situation. The purpose of these simulations was to improve the vehicle models, by refining their wheels and steering-suspension systems, for better prediction and reproduction of the vehicle behaviour in oblique collisions with guardrails. The refined front wheels and steering-suspension systems simulated better the impact behaviour of the vehicles for the wheel-post impacts. A vehicle model needs these refined systems to improve the analysis of oblique impacts with guardrails. With the aid of the computer simulation tool, a roadside feature can be crash analysed for vehicles under conditions that are not defined in a standard. Although only some of the simulations have been validated, due to high costs of crash tests, the vehicle models and guardrail models presented in this thesis can contribute to further numerical studies that simulate other roadside collisions...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of vehicle crash compatibility is the optimisation of vehicle design to minimise {{the total number}} of injuries and fatalities that occur in all collisions in the accident environment. It is hence distinguished from traditional perceptions of occupant protection in that it requires vehicle designs to be optimised to protect other road users in addition to the vehicleâ€™s own occupants. The aim of this thesis is to define an objective method to assess the compatibility of a front-to-front or front-to-side collision <b>between</b> two passenger <b>vehicles.</b> Accident statistics from the German In-Depth Accident Survey (GIDAS) relational database are analysed to determine the significance of passenger vehicle occupant casualties with regards to other road users and also to set priorities for the assessment of <b>compatibility</b> <b>between</b> passenger <b>vehicles.</b> Collision obstacles, configurations, velocity, and vehicle mass are analysed with respect to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). A method is defined to objectively measure compatibility by comparing the post-collision deformations from a vehicle-to-vehicle collision with the post-collision deformations from a series of vehicle-to-barrier collisions. The result is quantified with respect to injury data derived from the accident statistics. Ideal models of horizontal and vertical structural homogeneity are developed and applied in front-to-front and front-to-side collision simulations between a mid-sized passenger car and a large Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV). Hence, for the first time, independent conclusions are able to be drawn based on the effects of ideal horizontal homogeneity and ideal vertical homogeneity. The effects of front-end structural homogeneity are also investigated in combination with changes to the stiffness of various components in the vehicle side structure. Finally, the findings of the simulations and the accident analysis are used to describe the necessary characteristics for a test procedure to assess a vehicleâ€™s compatibility. The merits of existing test procedures are discussed, and alternative concepts are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Special reportThis {{report is}} part of a series {{evaluating}} the data reported to the Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS) Crash File undertaken by the Center for National Truck and Bus Statistics at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. The earlier studies showed that reporting to the MCMIS Crash File was incomplete. This report examines the factors that are associated with reporting rates for the state of Idaho. MCMIS Crash File records were matched to the Idaho Crash file to determine {{the nature and extent of}} underreporting. Overall, it appears that Idaho is reporting 72. 9 percent of crash involvements that should be reported to the MCMIS Crash file. Reporting rates vary by crash severity and vehicle type. Overall, more than 90 percent of fatal and injured/transported involvements are reported, but the rate drops to 60. 7 percent for crashes that are reportable based on the towed and disabled criterion. Furthermore, 86 percent of the unreported cases fall into the towed and disabled category. It appears that injury-related crashes tend to be reported, while those involving no injury are less likely to be reported. Crashes involving large trucks such as tractor-semitrailers or doubles combinations were more likely to be reported than crashes involving small, single-unit trucks or buses. The reporting rate for the state police is 82. 0 percent, while the rate for police departments is 55. 7 percent. Missing data rates, except for a few variables, are generally low in the MCMIS Crash file. <b>Compatibility</b> <b>between</b> the <b>vehicle</b> configuration and number of fatalities variables in the Idaho Data file and the MCMIS Crash file is generally good...|$|R
