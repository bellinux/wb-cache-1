The SIRAD has a <b>chemical</b> <b>strip</b> that changes color based upon incident radiation. The color change is instantaneous and cumulative. The card {{was designed for}} first responders {{as a way for}} them to have integrating dosimeters without the need for processing facilities. The SIRAD has a range of 0 to 200 rads. Multiple SIRAD cards were exposed to known radiation fields of a gamma source (Cs- 137) and two different neutron sources: a PuBe source and the thermal column of the Oregon State University's TRIGA reactor. The chemical strips of each card were compared to the reference dose color key provided with the SIRAD cards. The cards gamma response to Cs- 137 was consistent with the manufacturer's claim. The cards did not show a response to either the fast neutrons of the PuBe source or the thermal neutrons from the reactor. Quantitative measurements of SIRAD response was done using a commercially available document scanner. The scanner was tested to determine the variation in readout across the scannable surface and whether multiple scans would affect the <b>chemical</b> <b>strip.</b> Multiple scanners were examined to determine their consistency in results.

40|$|A direct {{bioluminescence}} assay for bacteriuria screening {{is described}} and {{compared with the}} MS- 2 system (Abbott Laboratories, Irvine, Tex.) and the <b>chemical</b> <b>strip,</b> Gram smear, and calibrated-loop methods. A total of 973 specimens were tested. Unlike previously described bioluminescence methods, this test measures total ATP in urine without pretreatment of samples to remove somatic ATP. The result was compared with an ATP standard (20 ng/ml). A low result (less than 3 % of standard) was interpreted as negative and a high result (greater than 10 % of standard) as positive. Samples with intermediate results (38 % of total) were incubated at 35 degrees C in thioglycolate broth (1 : 10). A 2 % increase in ATP concentration was interpreted as positive. The sensitivity of this method for detecting greater than 10 (5) pathogens per ml was 92. 3 % and was {{comparable to those of}} the MS- 2 system (92. 7 %) and the Gram smear method (90. 5 %). The <b>chemical</b> <b>strip</b> method was less sensitive (84. 0 %). The direct bioluminescence method was more sensitive than were the MS- 2 system and the Gram smear method for detecting low-level bacteriuria (less than 10 (3) to 10 (5) organisms per ml), primarily because of associated pyuria. Thioglycolate broth provided a suitable medium for ATP production, and 5 % CO 2 decreased bacterial ATP synthesis during log-phase growth.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the stability of urine collected in preservative tubes for chemistry strip analyses and particle counting to determine whether the transport of urine samples with all of their constituents is possible. Materials and methods: 275 pathologic urine specimens were included. Each urine sample was evaluated after 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours of storage in BD Vacutainer® Plus Urinalysis Preservative (BD UAP) tubes and compared with refrigeration at 4 °C. All analyses were peformed on H- 800 and FUS- 200 automatic modular urine analyzers (Dirui Industry, Changchun, China). The kappa coefficients (?), false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) rates were evaluated. ? > 0. 8 was accepted as good agreement. Results: Haemoglobin (Hb), leucocyte esterase (LE), and protein (Pro) analyses should be performed within 4 hours, whereas glucose (Glc) was stable until the end of 48 hours in both storage conditions. Nitrite (Nit) was well preserved in BD UAP tubes for 24 hours but was stable only up to 8 hours at 4 °C. Bilirubin (Bil) had very high FN rates even at 4 hours in both conditions. The particle counting showed high FN rates for white blood cells (WBC) and red blood cells (RBC), whereas squamous epithelial cells (EC) were stable up to 8 hours in both conditions. Conclusions: Preanalytical requirements for both urine <b>chemical</b> <b>strip</b> analyses and particle counting in a unique sample were not met in either condition.

40|$|A {{number of}} physiochemical and {{microbiological}} stability parameters of compost were compared and their suitability in monitoring {{the composting process}} were evaluated. Two composting piles were constructed as open-windrow systems under local weather condition. A farm manure waste windrow (MA) was made from fresh feed-pad dairy manure and straw, spoiled hay, wood chips and poultry litter, while a green waste windrow (GW) consisted of municipally collected green waste. The changes observed in selected parameters, included the contents of C, N, organic matter (OM) and water soluble C (WSC), 13 C NMR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, microbial respiration, FDA hydrolysis activity, microbial biomass and nitrate and ammonium content, were investigated in samples collected from the four different phases of composting. The results showed OM transformations occurring during the composting process of both GW and MA windrows can be revealed from 13 C NMR spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. In addition, this study again confirmed that WSC {{can act as a}} reliable measurement of the stability of compost regardless of the type of initial materials. The significant loss of OM (33. 8 % in MA windrow and 25. 0 % in GW windrow) and low values of WSC (2. 46 and 2. 02 mg per g of dried sample in MA and GW compost respectively after 175 days of composting) from both windrows were in agreement with the molecular, microbiological parameters and thermal analysis and confirmed that the end products from both windrows were fully stabilized. In light of the results obtained from the biochemical parameters, the reliability of using <b>chemical</b> <b>strip</b> tests for monitoring stability of compost on farm were evaluated by correlating the method results with standard chemical tests and validated by comparing with other stability parameters. The content of NO 3 [...] N and NH 3 -N were estimated by the proposed Strip Test Methods and the methods were found to be strongly correlated with the standard chemical analysis (r= 0. 967 & 0. 977 for NO 3 [...] N and NH 3 -N respectively, p< 0. 01). In addition, an NH 3 strip test was found to have high r 2 value with WSC in both the GW (0. 97, p< 0. 01) and MA windrows (0. 93, p< 0. 01) indicating that both WSC and NH 3 strip test can be used as maturity indicators regardless of the substrate mixtures used in this study...|$|E

40|$|Paint removal is {{a common}} {{maintenance}} requirement for aircraft as well as naval and land vehicles, since external paint gets damaged and loses much of its corrosion protection effectiveness with time. Paint removal is also conducted when metallic aircraft structures are inspected periodically for fatigue cracks and corrosion. The conventional methods of removing paint employed throughout the Canadian Forces mainly include <b>chemical</b> <b>stripping</b> and abrasive media blasting. <b>Chemical</b> <b>stripping</b> {{involves the use of}} hazardous chemicals, which are high in Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) and Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP).

30|$|Some common {{problems}} of textile dyeing industries include uneven or faulty dyeing and formation of color patches on the fabric surface during dyeing and downstream processing of textiles materials. Such {{problems in the}} finished quality of fabric are generally tackled through a <b>chemical</b> <b>stripping</b> process which is a common practice in dyeing industries for the deep shade batches. However, reactive dyes cannot be stripped satisfactorily from cellulosic materials due {{to the formation of}} co-valent bonds between dye and fiber. This research was undertaken using 2.5 % and 5 % bi-hetero reactive dyes on pretreated cotton fabric and dye stripping was carried out in alkali reductive stripping process. The aim of the work was to investigate the effects of dye stripping on the quality of cotton fabric. Strength loss, weight loss, pilling resistance and absorbency of stripped fabric were calculated. Though with the increase of concentration of <b>stripping</b> <b>chemicals</b> and temperature, <b>stripping</b> percentages were improved; processing damage to the fabric such as losses in strength, weight and pilling resistance ratings was found. In contrast, increased fabric absorbency was found due to stripping. This is explained that during stripping, alkaline solution as an intracrystalline swelling agent is effective in loosening the crystalline region of cotton in addition to the amorphous region. Stripping agent can also attack such crystalline region. As a result, cotton fiber can release maximum number of hydroxyl groups which previously formed covalent bonds. This is the reason behind the stripped fabric having more water absorbency.|$|R

40|$|We are {{developing}} {{a new way of}} separating carbon dioxide from flue gas based on ionic pumping of carbonate ions dissolved in water. Instead of relying on large temperature or pressure changes to remove carbon dioxide from solvent used to absorb it from flue gas, the ion pump increases the concentration of dissolved carbonate ion in solution. This increases the overlying vapor pressure of carbon dioxide gas, which can be removed from the downstream side of the ion pump as a nearly pure gas. This novel approach to increasing the concentration of the extracted gas permits new approaches to treating flue gas. The slightly basic water used as the extraction medium is impervious to trace acid gases that destroy existing solvents, and no pre-separation is necessary. The simple, robust nature of the process lends itself to small separation plants.

We took advantage of the differences in biochemical properties of covalently linked DNA oligonucleotides on in situ synthesized microarrays and the antisense cRNA hybridization probes. The success of stripping protocols for microarrays on glass was critically dependent on the type of arrays, the nature of sample used for hybridization, as well as hybridization and washing conditions. The protocol employs alkali hydrolysis of the cRNA, several enzymatic degradation steps using RNAses and Proteinase K, combined with appropriate washing steps...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} of the Knoop hardness anisotropy on left brace 001 right brace and left brace 110 right brace faces of MgO. Specimens were etched to show dislocation positions. This etching was repeated after <b>chemical</b> surface <b>stripping,</b> {{so as to}} reveal the three-dimensional arrangements of dislocations around indentations made in low-index directions on the two surfaces. These dislocation arrangements are compared with those predicted by two hardness-anisotropy models. Additionally, the influence of elastic recovery and surface pile-up on measured hardness has been investigated...|$|R
30|$|In case of 2.5 % shade, {{strength}} loss percentages were increased gradually {{with the}} increase of concentration of <b>stripping</b> <b>chemicals</b> both at 80 °C and 100 °C as shown in Figure  3. In between 80 °C and 100 °C, it was noticed that strength loss percentages were higher at 100 °C when the fabrics were treated in same parameter. Here, the sample dyed with 2.5 % shade when treated with 10  g/l hydrose and 10  g/l caustic soda at 100 °C showed maximum strength loss of 9.23 % in comparison to the maximum strength loss of 8.46 % when treated at 80 °C under the same combination of <b>stripping</b> <b>chemicals.</b> As both the temperature and <b>stripping</b> <b>chemicals</b> were comparatively more, the extent of strength loss was also found more. Again, when caustic soda was doubled from 2.5  g/l to 5  g/l with 5  g/l hydrose, strength losses were increased from 3.07 % to 4.61 % (In case of 80 °C) and from 3.84 to 5.38 % (In case of 100 °C). Similarly, increasing caustic soda from 5  g/l to 10  g/l with 10  g/l hydrose resulted in increased strength loss from 6.15 % to 8.46 % (In case of 80 °C) and from 7.69 % to 9.23 % (In case of 100 °C).|$|R
