40|$|An empirally derived {{mathematical}} model {{was developed to}} calculate the pressure and temperature history during condensation of water vapor in an underground-nuclear-explosion cavity. The condensation process is non-isothermal. Use {{has been made of}} the <b>Clapeyron-Clausius</b> <b>equation</b> as a basis for development of the model. Analytic fits to the vapor pressure and the latent heat of vaporization for saturated-water vapor, together with an estimated value for the heat-transfer coefficient, have been used to describe the phenomena. The calculated pressure-history during condensation has been determined to be exponential, with a time constant somewhat less than that observed during the cooling of the superheated steam from the explosion. The behavior of the calculated condensation-pressure compares well with the observed-pressure record (until just prior to cavity collapse) for a particular nuclear-detonation event for which data is available.

40|$|Natural organic {{polyelectrolytes}} (humic and fulvic acids) {{and their}} metal complexes were removed by adsorption onto xonotlite. The removal percentages of humic and fulvic acids by xonotlite were ～～ 80 % and 30 %, respectively. Humic acid removal from solution by adsorption onto xonotlite took place {{more readily than}} fulvic acid removal. The molecular weight distributions of the humic substances remaining in solution after adsorption with the xonotlite were measured with size exclusion chromatography. A comparison of molecular weight distributions demonstrated conclusively that large molecular weight components were adsorbed preferentially, indicating that adsorption efficiency depends {{on the number of}} functional groups of humic substances. Furthermore, the surface topography of the adsorbent was observed before and after adsorption by scanning electron microscopy. The calculated heat of adsorption was of 330 kJ mol- 1 which was evaluated from the <b>Clapeyron-Clausius</b> <b>equation.</b> Therefore, the adsorption type can be considered chemical. Since xonotlite can be easily synthesized and obtained at low cost, the adsorption method of humic and fulvic acids is superior to their precipitation...|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim of {{the current}} work was to {{determine}} thermo dynamical properties of 5 (2 ‑nitro phenyl) ‑furan‑ 2 ‑carbaldehyde, 5 (3 ‑nitro phenyl) ‑furan‑ 2 ‑carbaldehyde and 5 (4 ‑nitro phenyl) ‑furan‑ 2 ‑carbaldehyde. Results: The temperature dependence of saturated vapor pressure of 5 (2 ‑nitro phenyl) ‑furan‑ 2 ‑carbaldehyde, 5 (3 ‑nitro phenyl) ‑furan‑ 2 ‑carbaldehyde and 5 (4 ‑nitro phenyl) ‑furan‑ 2 ‑carbaldehyde was determined by Knudsen’s effusion method. The results are presented by the <b>Clapeyron–Clausius</b> <b>equation</b> in linear form, and via this form, the standard enthalpies, entropies and Gibbs energies of sublimation and evaporation of compounds were calculated at 298. 15 K. The standard molar formation enthalpies of compounds in crystalline state at 298. 15 K were determined indirectly by the corresponding standard molar combustion enthalpy, obtained using bomb calorimetry combustion. Conclusions: Determination of the thermodynamic properties for these compounds may contribute to solving prac‑ tical problems pertaining optimization processes of their synthesis, purification and application and it will also provide a more thorough insight regarding the theoretical knowledge of their nature...|$|E
40|$|A B S T R A C T: The diagenetic {{conversion}} of smectite to illite in shales {{has been proposed}} as a mechanism for generating overpressure (fluid pressure above hydrostatic) insedimentary basins. However, the mechanism and rate-controlling factors of the reaction and {{the magnitude of the}} resulting volume change are not known. In this paper the thermodynamics of the reversible hydration/dehydration f smectite are analysed in the pressure/temperature regime of sedimentary ocks. If the interlamellar water is more dense than bulk water, and the pressures on the solid and fluid phases are equal, the dehydration temperature should increase with increasing confining pressure via the <b>Clapeyron-Clausius</b> <b>equation.</b> However, either fluid pressures below the pressure on the solid matrix or high pore-fluid salinities can reduce the dehydration temperature. Experiments on Ca 2 +-montmorillonite compacted in the presence of distilled water in a steel autoclave fitted with a sensitive pressure transducer failed to detect any overall volume change due to dehydration up to 185 ~ and 1400 bar. This finding, which is consistent with recent high-pressure DTA and XRD studies on Na+-montmorillonite, suggests hat reversible loss of the last two water layers does not occur in sedimentary basins except as part of the more complex diagenetic {{conversion of}} smectite to illite. Some recent evidence from high-resolutio...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{understand}} the effect of cis unsaturation on the thermotropic and barotropic phase behavior of phospholipid bilayer membranes, the phase transitions of 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DOPC), 1 -stearoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (SOPC), 1, 2 -distearoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DSPC) bilayer membranes were observed by high-pressure optical method. With respect to DOPC bilayer membrane, the so-called main transition between the liquid crystalline (Lα) and the lamellar gel (Lβ) phases was observed in water at above 0 °C under high pressure, in addition to the transition between the Lα and the lamellar crystalline (LC) phases in 50 % aqueous ethylene glycol. The pressure of main transition increased linearly with an increase in temperature. Extrapolation of temperature (T) -pressure (P) phase boundary to ambient pressure suggests the temperature of the main transition to be − 40. 3 °C, which has never been found by the DSC method. On the other hand, the temperature of LC/Lα phase transition in 50 % aqueous ethylene glycol was found to be − 12. 0 °C at ambient pressure. The main transition temperatures for DSPC, SOPC and DOPC are 55. 6, 6. 7 and − 40. 3 °C, respectively, at ambient pressure. The substitution of cis unsaturated chain for saturated chains of DSPC brings about the depression of the main transition temperature by about 48 (± 1) °C for each chain. The volume changes (ΔV) associated with the transitions were calculated from the transition enthalpy (ΔH) and the slope of T-P diagram (dT/dP) by means of the <b>Clapeyron-Clausius</b> <b>equation.</b> The value of ΔV for the main transition of SOPC bilayer membranes was reduced to half the volume change for DSPC bilayers, which means the introduction of the cis double bond in the acyl chain of lipids brings about the reduction of ΔV because of the disordered packing of unsaturated chains in the gel phase of lipid bilayer membranes...|$|E
40|$|During {{the morning}} hours of 8 March 1999, {{freezing}} precipitation fell over portions of western Nebraska, including the communities of McCook, North Platte and Valentine between midnight and 10 : 00 A. M. CST. The freezing precipitation resulted in dangerous travel conditions, causing several automobile accidents, along with the delay and temporary closing of area public schools 8 March 1999. The freezing rain changed over to snow later the same morning. A forecast for snow, rather than freezing precipitation, was issued by the local forecast office. The forecast issued was based predominately on numerical weather prediction guidance, and the observed temperature profile of the atmosphere. The observed temperature profile of the atmosphere was below 0 °C throughout its entire vertical extent. The {{purpose of this study}} is to present important components of cloud microphysics that will be useful in an operational forecasting environment. It has been shown in numerous studies that clouds consist predominately of water vapor until the cloud reaches a critical temperature of - 15 °(Rogers and Yau, 1989.) In general, for the lower 48 conterminous states, ice crystal growth by deposition, aided by the presence of ice nuclei (predominately vermiculite), is maximized at - 15 °C (Houghton, 1950.) In this particular situation, an operational forecaster must possess a basic understanding of cloud microphysics in order to accurately assess the atmospheric potential for liquid versus freezing or frozen precipitation. Numerical weather prediction guidance, nomograms, and thickness schemes did not accurately predict precipitation type in this particular atmospheric environment, which included a low level stratus cloud layer at a temperature between 0 °C and - 10 °C. For this case, the synoptic and sub-synoptic-scale environment, as well as vertical atmospheric structure will be examined. By substituting the latent heat of sublimation for the latent heat of evaporation in the <b>Clapeyron-Clausius</b> <b>equation,</b> where Hvap = 597. 3 cal/gm, and Hsub= 677. 0 cal/gm, then solving for temperature, it shows that the saturation vapor pressure over ice is less than over water (Smith, 1995.) Therefore, the saturation vapor pressure of super-cooled water droplets is more than that of ice nuclei. Because of this difference in saturation vapor pressures, the ice crystals will grow at the expense of the water vapor droplets in the cloud (the Bergeron Process, Ahrens, 1991.) At temperatures between - 10 °C and - 15 °C, ice crystal growth is maximized, as the difference in saturation vapor pressure is greatest (Neuberger, 1967) Once the ice crystal growth process begins, the threat of liquid precipitation falling from the cloud and freezing on surface features becomes minimal. It follows logically then, that at temperatures between 0 °C and - 10 °C, there is a greater threat of super-cooled water droplets falling from the cloud, freezing as they deposit on surfaces...|$|E
