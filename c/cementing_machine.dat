Vancomycin is effective against nearly all resistant pathogens now involved in prosthesis infection. The mechanical properties of vancomycin-impregnated cement {{have never been}} studied. Tobramycin extends the spectrum to Gram negative bacteria and has been well studied as used in bone cement. This antibiotic mixture covers most of the pathogens resulting from arthroplasty thus providing an active local prophylaxis against infection.

40|$|Numerous testing regimes {{have been}} used in vitro to assess the fatigue {{behaviour}} of acrylic bone cements. While some {{attempts have been made to}} introduce an optimal protocol that measures the fatigue life of bone cement under similar stress conditions to those exist in vivo, the effects of specific testing variables such as test specimen specification and stress parameters are still questionable. These factors can be important since inconsistency in results have been reported regarding the precise effects of other variables such as the mixing method of cement components and the resultant porosity. For a given series of testing variables; namely, specimen cross sectional shape, surface production method and stress type and level (herein collectively termed testing regime), this study investigates the effect of each variable on both the fatigue life and the fatigue crack propagation properties (fatigue behaviour) of bone cement. Testing was constantly performed in 37 ˚C saline under stress-controlled conditions at a frequency of 3 Hz (2 Hz for the CT specimens). All specimens were produced after vacuum mixing of the cement components and soaked in 37 ˚C saline for 1 - 6 weeks. Specimens were manufactured with two cross sectional shapes: rectangular (ISO 527 - 2) and circular (ASTM F 2118), using two production methods: direct moulding or machining. Two different bone cements were used: SmartSet GHV and CMW 1. For each specimen type, at least 10 specimens were fatigued to failure at a maximum stress of 20 MPa applying either fully reversed tension-compression (R= – 1) or tension-tension (R= 0. 1) loading, followed by Weibull analysis. For the fully reversed loading only, at least 5 specimens were tested for each group at other three levels: ± 12. 5, ± 15 and ± 30 MPa and the four stresses were compared using S-N curves. Behaviour of fatigue cracks were assessed based on the cyclic stress-strain responses. CT specimens were used to measure the crack growth rates in the two cements. The findings of this study have emphasised the important role of the set of a testing regime variables included in testing and identified the influence of each testing variable on the fatigue behaviour of bone <b>cement.</b> <b>Machining</b> of test specimens and applying high stress levels, in particular, can lead to irrelevant findings when considering the in vivo conditions, depending also on the cement composition.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} was to determine the differences in failure load between <b>cemented</b> and fused <b>machined</b> veneers to zirconia while observing the effects of real time aging on failure load between <b>cemented</b> and fused <b>machined</b> veneers to zirconia. The study was to examine the differences in aging and fatigue resistance amongst a machined glass-ceramic veneer and a machined feldspathic porcelain veneer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: VITA In Ceram YZ zirconia blocks were used as a substructure framework for the three unit fixed partial denture. The veneering material was either milled IPS e. max CAD (glass-ceramic) or milled VITABLOCS Triluxe Forte (feldspathic porcelain). The types of linking material between the substructures and veneering material were either fusing or cementation. Observations were compared between aged and non-aged specimens divided into two main groups; (a) non-aged group (b) aged for three years at room temperature. Each group has two subgroups; fused and cemented which are further divided into static and cyclic fatigue at 20 K, 60 K and 80 K. Specimens were subjected to load to failure test using universal test machine. 40 % of failure load was calculated for the cyclic fatigue subgroups. In order to examine the difference in failure load between the static and fatigued specimens, the Tukey-Kramer HSD test was used to analyze the data. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The VITABLOCS Triluxe Forte (feldspathic porcelain) fused to YZ zirconia showed significantly lower failure load values compared to all the other groups (p˂ 0. 05). The non-aged VITABLOCS Triluxe Forte cemented to YZ zirconia (static and cyclic) showed significantly higher load to failure than the aged cemented Triluxe fatigued groups (p˂ 0. 05).

In this study, finite element analysis (FEA) software, SolidWorks CosmosExpress was used to study load bearing capacity of the cutting tool extensively. Results from cutting tests indicate increased tool life and better surface finish and reduce power loading by 18 % when the tool was operated at 40 % faster than the recommended standard speed. When the tool begins to wear out, tool wear characteristics did not affect dimensional accuracy of the work-piece. The surface enhancement, called „residual island‟ treatment, produces an undulating surface topography on the tool. As the tool wears, „islands ‟ of residual titanium nitride remained in the valleys, which continued to provide wear resistance. It is expected that residual island effect would occur for most, if not all, types of coating. It was therefore concluded that TiN coatings if applied to turning tools with crater-like surface structures provide satisfactory lubricating properties which help in providing protection to the tool substrates against friction and wear.

Thirty-two feldspathic porcelain crowns, also fabricated out of pre-sintered ceramic blocks, were then cemented with resin cement on all the abutments in both groups. All samples were subsequently subjected to fracture strength testing under static load. An unpaired t-test was used to compare fracture load values between the two groups. Results: The test group using feldspathic porcelain abutments and crowns showed statistically significant higher mean fracture strength than the control group with the Ti abutments and feldspathic porcelain crowns.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} Adequate depth of cement {{penetration}} and cement mantle thickness {{is important for}} the durability of cemented cups. A flanged cup, as opposed to unflanged, has been suggested to give a more uniform cement mantle and superior cement pressurization, thus improving the depth of cement penetration. This hypothesis was tested experimentally. Materials and methods The same cup design with and without flange (both without cement spacers) was investigated regarding intraacetabular pressure, cement mantle thickness, and depth of <b>cement</b> penetration. With <b>machine</b> control, the cups were inserted into open-pore ceramic acetabular models (10 flanged, 10 unflanged) and into paired cadaver acetabuli (10 flanged, 10 unflanged) with prior pressurization of the cement. Results No differences in intraacetabular pressures during cup insertion were found, but unflanged cups tended to migrate more towards the acetabular pole. Flanged cups resulted in thicker cement mantles because of less bottoming out, whereas no differences in cement penetration into the bone were observed. Interpretation Flanged cups do not generate higher cementation pressure or better cement penetration than unflanged cups. A possible advantage of the flange, however, may be to protect the cup from bottoming out, and there is possibly better closure of the periphery around the cup, sealing off the cement-bone interface...|$|R

Fatigue testing samples have been made into various shapes using different surface preparation techniques with little attention being paid {{to the importance of}} these variations on the fatigue results. The present study focuses on the effect of test sample shape and surface production method on the fatigue results. The samples were manufactured with two cross sectional shapes: rectangular according to ISO 527 and circular according to ASTM F 2118. Each shape was produced using two methods: direct moulding of the <b>cement</b> dough and <b>machining</b> from oversized rods. Testing was performed twice using two different bone cements: SmartSet GHV and DePuy CMW 1. At least 10 samples of each category were tested, under fully reversed tension-compression fatigue stress at ± 20 MPa, to allow for Weibull analysis to compare results. The growths of fatigue cracks were compared by means of the variations in energy absorption. It was found that fatigue crack growth can be altered by the sample shape and production method; however it is also dependent on the chemical composition of the cement. The results revealed that moulded samples, particularly those based on the ASTM F 2118 standard, can lead to up to 5. 5 times greater fatigue lives compared to the machined samples. It is thus essential, when comparing the fatigue results of bone cement, to consider the effect of production method along with the shape of the test sample...|$|R
