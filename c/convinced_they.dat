5|$|In {{the final}} round, Johnson faced the one {{remaining}} Team Koscheck member, Nam Phan. In a back-and-forth fight, Johnson scored takedowns. The consensus after {{the fight was}} that Johnson won the opening round, and Phan the second. The third was in dispute however, with each fighter's coach <b>convinced</b> <b>they</b> had won the round. Johnson was declared the winner via split decision.|$|E
5|$|Back at {{the bowling}} alley, Homer {{and his friends}} enter the bowling league competition, calling {{themselves}} the Pin Pals. They beat three teams before moving up into second place in their league. Meanwhile, Burns recovers from his stupor and discovers the check he wrote to Homer. Burns wants to join the team (replacing Otto in the team), but since Burns is a horrible bowler, the team is <b>convinced</b> <b>they</b> will lose the championship.|$|E
5|$|The British, Americans and Soviet Union {{discussed}} the proposal. British Foreign Secretary (later Prime Minister) Anthony Eden wrote a memo on 26 June outlining the options. The British were <b>convinced</b> <b>they</b> {{were dealing with}} a Himmler trick, perhaps an attempt to broker a peace deal without the Soviet Union. If the deal had gone ahead and large numbers of Jews had been released in central Europe, Allied airborne and possibly land-based military operations might have had to stop. Bauer believes the British feared this was Himmler's motive– to turn the Jews into human shields– {{because it would have}} allowed the Germans to devote their forces to fighting the Red Army.|$|E

5|$|The {{player is}} free to join {{any one of the}} servile groups and share common goals, or remain unaligned. Geneforge can be {{completed}} without joining any group. Trajkov can be killed through combat or tricked into killing himself by using the Geneforge. He can also be aided in activating the device, if the player steals the shaper gloves from Goettsch. Goettsch offers the player fake shaper gauntlets, which do not protect Trajkov from the Geneforge's energy should he be <b>convinced</b> <b>they</b> are genuine shaping gloves. The player can complete the game by using the last boat on Sucia Island. The small vessel is moored in a guarded dock {{on the far side of}} the island. Finishing the game unlocks one of more than a dozen game endings, dependent on the player's actions during the game.|$|E
5|$|<b>Convinced</b> <b>they</b> {{would be}} killed if the Malagasy {{discovered}} the truth while still on board ship, the crew sealed their messages in bottles and dropped them into the onshore current. The VOC authorities in Cape Town had sent their chief ship's carpenter, Philip van den Berg, with two other ship's carpenters, two pilots, a quartermaster and 20 sailors overland. Carpenters were needed since neither of Meermin boats, now onshore, could be used: one {{was buried in the}} sand, and the other was in need of repair. The party from Cape Town had arrived by 6March, and, while Johannes Le Sueur was overseeing the carpenters' examination of Meermins boats, he was handed a bottle containing a message signed by Jan de Leeuw. A second bottle, containing a message signed by Olof Leij, was also found and handed to Le Sueur, and the fires were lit on 7March. One of the messages is preserved in the Cape Archives Repository.|$|E
5|$|The London to Portsmouth route {{was to be}} {{completed}} by the Portsmouth and Arundel Canal, in which Wyndham and the Cutfields, who also held many shares in the Arun Navigation, were both significant subscribers. This was authorised by Act of Parliament in 1817, and an agreement was reached that the Arun would be improved to aid through traffic. Nevertheless, no work commenced on the Arun until the proprietors were sure that the Ford section of the new canal would actually be built. Once they were <b>convinced,</b> <b>they</b> obtained an Act of Parliament in May 1821, and the engineer James Hollingworth oversaw the improvements, which were completed in mid-1823. The work involved improving the depth and width of the channel, and some alterations to bridges and locks to make their size more uniform. The company borrowed £3000 to finance the work, which cost around £5000 in total. The loans had been repaid by 1831, and the work allowed barge sizes to be increased from 30 tons to 40 tons, with the result that business improved.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{earliest}} of the Lourdes apparitions, {{there has been}} intense debate regarding their veracity. The earliest investigators, including the priest Abbé Dominique Peyramale and the Chief of Police, Dominique Jacomet, were both initially <b>convinced</b> <b>they</b> were dealing with a hoax (both later changed their minds), and several researchers have since called several aspects of the Lourdes phenomenon into question.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} the Gateway {{development}} leaves the railway capacity of the station more or less unaltered has not escaped attention. In July 2008 the House of Commons Transport Committee criticised the plans: it was not <b>convinced</b> <b>they</b> were adequate {{for the number of}} trains which could end up using the station. It said if the station could not be adapted, the government needed to look for alternative solutions.|$|E
25|$|Duran Duran {{was founded}} by {{childhood}} friends John Taylor and Nick Rhodes along with singer/songwriter Stephen Duffy in 1978, but Duffy left a year later, <b>convinced</b> <b>they</b> weren't going anywhere. The band went through a long succession of lineup changes after Duffy's departure, but finally settled on a guitarist and drummer. The band had a powerful pop sound flavoured with disco, funk and electronics, built on a solid rock rhythm section, and all they needed was a charismatic singer with a distinctive voice.|$|E

25|$|Self-esteem {{may make}} people <b>convinced</b> <b>they</b> deserve happiness. Understanding this is fundamental, and universally beneficial, since the {{development}} of positive self-esteem increases the capacity to treat other people with respect, benevolence and goodwill, thus favoring rich interpersonal relationships and avoiding destructive ones. For Erich Fromm, love of others and love of ourselves are not alternatives. On the contrary, an attitude of love toward themselves will be found in all those {{who are capable of}} loving others. Self-esteem allows creativity at the workplace, and is a specially critical condition for teaching professions.|$|E
25|$|The Great Assembly {{that was}} held between January and August, 1651, {{addressed}} {{a number of important}} issues. The first one was that of the stadholderate. Friesland and Groningen led the opposition to Holland, arguing that the Union of Utrecht required the appointment of provincial stadtholders by implication, as the articles 9 and 21 of the treaty stipulated mediation by stadtholders in case of conflicts between provinces. In their interpretation the office of stadtholder thereby acquired a federal aspect. But the other provinces were not <b>convinced.</b> <b>They</b> decided to leave the office vacant indefinitely. It should be noted, however, that the office was not abolished, not even in Holland and Zeeland.|$|E
25|$|One notable tactic was Kammhuber's {{offensive}} action. In {{keeping with}} the Luftwaffes defence by offensive action over enemy territory, Kammhuber suggested tracking bombers and attacking them as they took off from their bases in Britain. Hitler refused {{on the grounds that}} the German people needed to see the British bombers being brought down over Germany so as to be <b>convinced</b> <b>they</b> were being defended. After October 1941, the Luftwaffe stopped their mini offensive. Hitler's decision relieved Harris and Bomber Command. In 1940–1941 these intruders had been responsible for two-thirds of the RAF losses. The chance to wreak havoc on the bomber offensive was lost. In response, Kammhuber concentrated on building the Kammhuber Line.|$|E

25|$|After {{eight months}} of horrible jungle {{experience}} where they advanced just , the heavily reduced troops reached La Tora, now called Barrancabermeja. Easier to defend, the settlement was taken {{as a place of}} rest for about three months and to bury the 100 more dead soldiers of which many were thrown in the river to become food for the crocodiles. Plagued by the hot climate, mosquitos and illnesses and conscious that the broad river extended upwards, the expedition continued south. Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada was <b>convinced</b> <b>they</b> would reach the lands full of gold they heard about at the Caribbean coast and motivated his delegation of soldiers, that at this time had an average age of 27 years old, to walk on.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between the three complicated further as Mathilde became pregnant. The baby was conceived around mid-September 1901, before her trip to Italy. On 18 June 1902, Mathilde {{gave birth to a}} son. Both grand dukes were at first <b>convinced</b> <b>they</b> were the child’s father. After the Revolution, Kschessinska and Grand Duke Andrei maintained that Andrei was the father. The child, who became known within the family by his nickname, Vova, received the name and patronymic Vladimir Sergeievich. No surname was made public until 1911. The birth certificate showed Sergei as the father. Grand Duke Sergei was devoted to the child, looking after mother and son until his exile and subsequent execution following the fall of the Russian monarchy. The question of Vladimir’s paternity remains unresolved. However, most sources attribute the paternity to Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich, whom the child resembled.|$|E
25|$|At Calcutta, {{the pair}} changed their disguises, now {{pretending to be}} Swiss businessmen, and {{continued}} on by train and river steamer to Chittagong, from where they took a sampan to Cox's Bazar. They continued on foot through the jungle, fighting hunger and the approaching monsoon. After {{more than a month}} on the run they crossed the Naf River into Burma, where they were captured and imprisoned by Japanese troops who were <b>convinced</b> <b>they</b> were spies. Following two months on starvation rations, they were transferred to a jail at Rangoon, where they were appalled by the conditions inflicted on Allied prisoners. In September 1944, four months after their initial escape, news of their presence in Burma was released to the Press, and soon they were flown to Japan, where they waited out the war, working as honorary consuls at the German Embassy in Tokyo.|$|E
