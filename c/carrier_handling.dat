50|$|Construction was slowed due {{to demand}} for the F-86 in Korea; the FJ-2 was not {{produced}} in large numbers until after that conflict had concluded. Only seven aircraft had been delivered by then end of 1953, and it was January 1954 before the first aircraft was delivered to a Marine squadron, VMF-122. The Navy preferred the lighter F9F Cougar due to its superior slow-speed performance for carrier operations, and the 200 FJ-2 models built were delivered to the United States Marine Corps. The Marines did make several cruises aboard carriers and tried to solve the type's <b>carrier</b> <b>handling</b> problems, but the FJ-2 was never really satisfactory. In 1956, the FJ-2 already disappeared from front-line service, and reserve units retired it in 1957.|$|E
50|$|Other canal freight also declined, {{and between}} 1893 and 1896 just 48 tons were shipped between Shrivenham and Wantage.

By then the canal was {{increasingly}} in disrepair, in 1901 {{the collapse of}} the Stanley Aqueduct effectively ended the little remaining traffic and in 1914 an Act of Parliament formalised the abandonment of the canal.|$|R
50|$|Another {{change in}} Gatwick Handling's {{ownership}} occurred, when BA acquired D&N {{along with some}} of the assets of Dan-Air for £1 in late-October 1992. As the UK flag <b>carrier</b> <b>handled</b> all of its Gatwick flights in-house and did not require Gatwick Handling's check-in desks, this resulted in disposal of the stake it had inherited in the ground handling company to remaining shareholders Delta and Northwest in 1993, thus dividing the ground handler's entire share capital between the two American carriers.|$|R

40|$|The {{utilization}} of reactive pulse magnetron sputtering for deposition of antireflective (AR), high reflective coatings (HR) and other applications require adapted equipment concepts {{to follow up}} production needs regarding high throughput and excellent process stability. The presented equipment concept is a modular open platform with upscaling possibilities. It is especially designed to perform simultaneously high qualitative dielectric coatings under different reactive gas conditions and different reactive gases also in combination with metal coatings. "SV in-line" allows individual substrate <b>carrier</b> <b>handling</b> as well as uninterrupted substrate carrier stream for reactive sputtered optical multi layer coatings in production environment with a high versatility and high complexity for different applications. The special design concept of the sputter machine, of the magnetrons and of the process control system minimise the unwanted influence of adjacent technological sections. This allows to realize a very compact in-line equipment. A special feature {{is the ability to}} use both pulse modes (unipolar or bipolar) as technological parameters to optimize the properties of the deposited films. Examples will be reported. Results are reported on long term process stability for entire target life time for production needs and on product development of optical multi layer coatings for AR and HR applications on glass and plastic substrates. Furthermore investigations are presented regarding the increase of process stability and yield using on-line process control based upon in-situ measurement of different film parameters...|$|E

50|$|Less than {{truckload}} shipping or {{less than}} load (LTL) is the transportation of relatively small freight. The alternatives to LTL carriers are parcel carriers or full truckload carriers.

Full truckload carriers move freight that is loaded into a semi-trailer. Semi trailers are typically between 26 and 53 ft and require a substantial amount of freight to make such transportation economical.|$|R
