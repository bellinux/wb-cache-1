Three sessions of static observations were {{performed at the}} field by different combination of GNSS receivers’ usage {{at the end of}} the baselines. While obtaining observations the <b>cut-off</b> <b>angle</b> was set on 0 °, but during the processing we simulated obstacles near GNSS receivers by increasing <b>cut-off</b> <b>angle.</b> We estimated how the obstacles influence the coordinates and tried to find the answer of which <b>cut-off</b> <b>angle</b> in the presence of obstacles could be negligible. We checked the effect of different types of ephemeris (broadcast and final precise) usage on final coordinate’s determination. Based on different strategy processing results, i. e. different sampling rate as well as shorter observation duration, we studied which factor has more influence on the coordinates’ quality. Coordinates acquired from relative post-processing were further used as the reference for studying the absolute PPP (Precise Point Positioning) post-processing results, where PPP coordinates were calculated by online applications MagicGNSS and TrimbleRTX. Finally, different coordinates were used in distances, horizontal angles and areas calculations to find out how different quality of coordinates affects indirect acquired quantities...|$|E

Recently, post-fit analysis of Gravity Probe B and binary pulsars lead to an upper limit at the 10 ^- 4 level on the time-time coefficient s̅^TT of the pure-gravity sector of the minimal SME. In this work, we derive the observable of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) in SME and then we implement it into a real data analysis code of geodetic VLBI observations.

40|$|Relativistic bending in the {{vicinity}} of a massive body is characterized only by the post-Newtonian parameter γ within the standard parameterized post-Newtonian formalism, which is unity in General Relativity. Aiming at estimating this parameter, we use very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) to measure the gravitational deflection of radio waves emitted by distant compact radio sources, by Solar System bodies. We analyze geodetic VLBI observations recorded since 1979. We compare estimates of γ and errors obtained using various analysis schemes including global estimations over several time spans and with various Sun elongation <b>cut-off</b> <b>angles,</b> and analysis of radio source coordinate time series. We arrive at the conclusion that the relativistic parameter γ cannot be estimated at better than 2 × 10 ^- 4. The main factor of limitation is the uncertainty in the determination of (global or session-wise) radio source coordinates. A sum of various instrumental and modeling errors and analysis strategy defects, that cannot be decorrelated and corrected yet, is at the origin of the limitating noise.

In the case of a ‘blind area’ at the source level from which no clast is ejected, the observed <b>cut-off</b> <b>angle</b> would be too steep, leading to an overestimate of z.

In the study region, key-layers are lacking and, for this reason, geometrical reconstructions are difficult. The main structure is a N-S-oriented syncline bounded by faults. Reconstructions using the fault-propaga-tion fold and trishear models indicate that this structure is controlled by faults, a western (WF, <b>cut-off</b> <b>angle</b> ~ 40 - 60 º) and an eastern fault (EF, <b>cut-off</b> <b>angle</b> ~ 20 º).

40|$|In {{the context}} of space applications, the GPS system is {{presently}} a well established and accepted tracking system. To meet the basic navigation requirements, most satellites in a low Earth orbit (LEO) are equipped with single-frequency GPS receivers that measure the C/A code {{as well as the}} L 1 phase. However, the resulting kinematic navigation solutions exhibit systematic position errors caused by elevation dependent ionospheric path delays. In this study a simple analytical model is established, which quantitatively relates the position error to the vertical electron content (VTEC) and the mapping function. This model substantiates the empirical evidence of a mean radial offset that increases in proportion to the total electron content above the satellite. It is furthermore shown that the ratio between this offset and the vertical ionospheric path delay depends on the applied elevation mask angle. Representative ratios of 3 - 5 are obtained for the mapping function of the Lear ionosphere model and elevation <b>cut-off</b> <b>angles</b> of 10 °, 5 ° and 0 °. This analytical result has further been confirmed by signal simulator tests as well as flight data of the CHAMP satellite...|$|R

The IWV trends given by the GPS elevation 10 ° and 25 ° solutions show similar results {{when compared to the}} trends from the radiosonde data, with correlation coefficients of 0. 71 and 0. 74, respectively. When compared to the IWV trends obtained from ERA-Interim, the GPS solution for the 25 ° elevation cutoff angle gives a significantly higher correlation (0. 90) than the one obtained for the 10 ° solution (0. 53). The results indicate that a higher elevation cutoff angle is meaningful when estimating long term trends, and that the use of different elevation cutoff angles in the GPS data processing is a valuable diagnostic tool for detection of any time varying multipath impacts...|$|R

40|$|A {{major problem}} of using GPS for {{deformation}} monitoring is signal distortion {{caused by the}} objects which form the skyline. Both local obstacles, like trees surrounding the station, and far away obstacles, like mountain ridges, lead to diffraction of the signal. In this paper we show data with corresponding biases in the observations up to 7 cm and a C/N 0 reduction of 10 - 12 dB. We discuss three different approaches to mitigate such errors. First we discuss the usage of a constant high <b>cut-off</b> <b>angle</b> when collecting or processing the observations. Alternatively, we investigate the usage of an azimuth-dependent elevation mask to cut out the affected observations. In the third approach, we discuss the mitigation of the effect using different variance models. The results show that a sufficiently high constant <b>cut-off</b> <b>angle</b> avoids diffraction effects at the obstacles, but the resulting bad geometry significantly reduces the attainable accuracy.

Using more than one constellation the number of the observed satellites is increased and the continuity and reliability of positioning significantly improved.

Particularly, GPS+GLONASS supplies higher performances compared to the other solutions. Because the low number of satellites in view, the contribution of GALILEO is limited, and its presence instead of GPS or GLONASS in the two constellation solutions produces a decrease in positioning accuracy. </p...|$|R
40|$|Fast high {{precision}} relative Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning {{is very important}} to various applications and ambiguity resolution is a key requirement. It has been a continuing challenge to determine and fix GNSS carrier-phase ambiguity, especially for medium-and long-distance baselines. In past research, with dual-frequency band Global Positioning System (GPS), it is almost impossible for fast ambiguity resolution of medium- and long-distance baselines mainly due to the ionospheric and tropospheric effects. With the launch of the BeiDou system, triple-frequency band GNSS observations are available for the first time. This research aims to test the ambiguity resolution performance with BeiDou triple-frequency band observations. In this research, two mathematical models are compared: zenith tropospheric delay as an unknown parameter versus corrected tropospheric delay. The ambiguity resolution performance is investigated in detail with BeiDou observations. Different distance baselines are tested: 45 km, 70 km and 100 km and the performances are investigated with different elevation <b>cut-off</b> <b>angles.</b> Also the performance with BeiDou alone and combined BeiDou and GPS are compared. Experimental results clearly show that with practical observations of triple-frequency bands, ambiguity of medium-or long-distance baselines can be fixed. The results also show that: the performance of ambiguity resolution with an elevation cutoff angle of 20 degrees is much better than that of 15 degrees; The performance with tropospheric effect corrected is slightly better than that with tropospheric effect as an estimated parameter; Dual-frequency band GPS observations will benefit ambiguity resolution of integrated BeiDou and GPS.

A seamless blending {{of the real}} and virtual worlds is key to increased immersion and improved user experiences for augmented reality (AR). Photorealistic and non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) {{are two ways to}} achieve this goal. Non-photorealistic rendering creates an abstract version of both the real and virtual world by stylization to make them indistinguishable. We present a painterly rendering algorithm for AR applications. This algorithm paints composed AR video frames with bump-mapping curly brushstrokes. Tensor fields are created for each frame to define the direction for the brushstrokes. We use tensor field pyramids to interpolate sparse tensor field values over the frame to avoid the numeric problems caused by global radial basis interpolation in existing algorithms. Due to the characteristics of AR applications we use only information from the current frame and previous frame to provide temporal coherence in two ways for the painted video. First, brushstroke anchors are warped from the previous frame to the current frame based on their neighbor feature points. Second, brushstroke appearances are reshaped by blending two parameterized brushstrokes to achieve better temporal coherence. The major difference between our algorithm and existing NPR work in general graphics and AR/VR areas is that we use feature points across AR frames to maintain coherence in the rendering. The use of tensor field pyramids and extra properties of brushstrokes, such as <b>cut-off</b> <b>angles,</b> are also novel features that extend exiting NPR algorithms...|$|R

40|$|The Umbria-Marche-Sabina ridge is bounded to {{the east}} by a {{defining}} a major thrust fault extending from Olevano Romano {{in the south to}} the Foglia River Valley in the north. This consists of two main portions arranged in a right-stepping en-échelon pattern. The northern portion («Belforte-Urbino Thrust») extends from the Chienti River Valley in the south to the Cesana Mts. in the north. The southern part (Olevano-Antrodoco-Monti Sibillini, or OAMS Thrust) extends from the Potenza River Valley in the north to Olevano Romano in the south. The former has a general NW-SE trend, changing to WNW-ESE north of the Metauro River Valley. The OAMS Thrust is arc shaped in its northern part, between the Potenza and the Velino River Valleys, and has a N-S strike to the south. The southernmost portion of the thrust consists of two minor segments displaying a right-stepping en-échelon geometry (Ascrea and Canterano Thrusts). The thrust involves the Mesozoic-Cenozoic Umbria-Marche succession and, south of the village of Posta, also involves the Latium-Abruzzi carbonate platform succession and the transitional sequence between the latter and the Umbria-Marche basin. Based on detailed field mapping, integrated also with available subsurface information, 14 geological cross-sections have been constructed. They allowed us to outline the main structural features of the Umbria-Marche-Sabina mountain front, and to infer thrust displacement. The hanging-wall unit mainly consists of an asymmetric, east-verging anticline showing a western gently dipping limb and an eastern vertical to overturned limb. Lens-shaped kilometre-sized tectonic slices also occur along the thrust zone. The thrust surface is locally folded into antiforms and synforms of different size. Locally, erosion associated with structural elevation exposes deep parts of the thrust fault. It displays hanging-wall ramp geometries – with dominant low to moderate <b>cut-off</b> <b>angles</b> – in the stratigraphic units predating the Cerrogna Marls. On the other hand, extensive flats occur in the latter formation. Locally down-section thrust trajectories also occur, as a result of pre-existing footwall deformation. The structural setting of the mountain front is complicated by the occurrence of both pre- and post-thrusting normal faults. The former are commonly deformed during the fold growth and are then offset by thrusts. Locally they also appear to have been reactivated by recent extensional movements. The maximum displacements occur along the Monte Vettore – Accumoli segment of the OAMS Thrust with values of about 10 km. The thrust can be referred to the late Messinian (post-evaporite) time, with locally continuing activity and/or reactivation during the Pliocene.

Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) is a subjective method of nutritional status. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the association between BIA derived phase angle and SGA in advanced colorectal cancer. Methods We evaluated a case series of 73 stages III and IV colorectal cancer patients. Patients were classified as either well-nourished or malnourished using the SGA. BIA was conducted on all patients and phase angle was calculated. The correlation between phase angle and SGA was studied using Spearman correlation coefficient. Receiver Operating Characteristic curves were estimated using the non-parametric method to determine the optimal cut-off levels of phase angle. Results Well-nourished patients had a statistically significantly higher (p = 0. 005) median phase angle score (6. 12) as compared to those who were malnourished (5. 18). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient between phase angle and SGA was found to be 0. 33 (p = 0. 004), suggesting better nutritional status with higher phase angle scores. A phase <b>angle</b> <b>cut-off</b> of 5. 2 was 51. 7 % sensitive and 79. 5 % specific whereas a cut-off of 6. 0 was 82. 8 % sensitive and 54. 5 % specific in detecting malnutrition.

40|$|The several {{phenomena}} {{involved in}} theoretical prediction of the far-field sound radiation attenuation from an acoustically lined duct have been studied. These include absorption by the suppressor, termination reflection, and far-field radiation. Extensive parameteric {{studies have shown}} that the suppressor absorption performance can be correlated with mode <b>cut-off</b> ratio or <b>angle</b> of propagation. The other phenomena can be shown to depend explicitly upon mode cut-off ratio. A complete system can thus be generated which can be used to evaluate aircraft sound suppressors and which can be related to the sound source through the cut-off ratio-acoustic power distribution. Although the method is most fully developed for inlet suppressors, several aft radiated noise phenomena will also be discussed. This paper summarized this simplified suppressor design and evaluation method, presents the recent improvements in the technique and discusses areas where further refinement is necessary. Noise suppressor data from engine experiments are compared with the theoretical calculations...|$|R
40|$|Soil erosion in the Upper Taquari Basin (UTB) {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious {{environmental}} and socioeconomic impacts in the Brazilian Pantanal. The influence of relief at the erosion risk is usually calculated by the topographic factor (LS) from the Universal Soil Loss Equation - USLE. Improvements in USLE have led to the evaluation of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation - RUSLE. New procedures, based on geographic information systems (GIS), have been developed to estimate factor (LS) in hydrographic basins. The complication to identify the deposition areas and their relation with the start and the end of slope length {{is one of the}} main difficulties in those areas where the deposition, not erosion, is the dominant process. The Van Remortel methodology includes a mechanism to define deposition areas called <b>cut-off</b> slope <b>angle,</b> which is a user-input value. The purpose of this research is to estimate the RUSLE LS factor for the UTB using methodology based on GIS of the Van Remortel. The digital elevation model was used from the TOPODATA project. The analyzed area was quantified to be occupying UTB 28, 078. 55 km 2. The estimated average by the RUSLE LS was 1. 602. Around 60 % of UTB factor LS area was between 0 and 1, and in only 18. 23 % of the basin total area the factor LS was above 2. The Van Remortel algorithm represent an improvement on the slope length calculation (&# 1490;) and consequently on RUSLEs LS factor computations. However, its use still demands field studies to proper validation. Pages: 4813 - 482...|$|R
40|$|A {{surgical}} tissue macerating {{and removal}} tool is described {{which has a}} rotating rod with a cutting member {{at one end and}} which disposed in a tube which is then contained in an extension of the tool handle. A frusto-conical member extends into the extension at the cutter member end of the rotating rod with its small end engaging the tube. The portion of the frusto-conical member outside of the extension forms a tissue engaging member and may be <b>cut-off</b> at an <b>angle</b> to the axis of the rod to form a tissue engaging edge. Apertures are provided in the extension adjacent the frusto-concial member so that treatment fluid supplied in the annular space between the tube and the extension may flow to the operative site. An aperture is provided in the frustoconical member between the extension and the tube so that fluid may also flow into the tube where it mixes with macerated tissue being directed through an aperture in the tube to a passageway which may have suction applied to help remove macerated material...|$|R
