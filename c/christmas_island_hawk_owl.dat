50|$|The <b>Christmas</b> <b>Island</b> <b>Hawk</b> <b>Owl</b> is a small, rufous-brown hawk-owl with a barred breast, dark {{chestnut}} facial mask, whitish brow, lores and throat, yellow eyes, {{legs and}} feet. It is approximately 26-29 cm {{in length and}} 130-190 grams in weight with the female slightly larger than the male.|$|E

30|$|The {{northern}} <b>hawk</b> <b>owl</b> {{is one of}} the least-studied {{birds in}} North America. It occurs from Alaska to Newfoundland and also from Scandinavia to Siberia. Although northern <b>hawk</b> <b>owls</b> are known to occupy burned forests (Duncan and Duncan 1994), the importance of burned vs. unburned forests is still largely unknown. In the only published comparison of northern <b>hawk</b> <b>owl</b> relative abundance between burned and unburned conifer-dominated boreal forest in North America, northern <b>hawk</b> <b>owls</b> were detected only in post-fire forest and were not detected in nearby unburned coniferous forest (Hannah and Hoyt 2004). There was also a significant negative exponential relationship between northern <b>hawk</b> <b>owl</b> abundance and time since fire, suggesting that burns were suitable for only about eight years following fire. Thus, {{there is some evidence that}} the northern <b>hawk</b> <b>owl</b> is yet another species that depends on (is relatively restricted to) conditions created by severe, stand-replacement fires in boreal forests of Canada.|$|R

Rasmussen in 1999 based on a single specimen collected by Frank Rozendaal from Bogani Nani Wartabone National Park on Minahassa Peninsula, northern Sulawesi, in 1985. Subsequently, it has also been observed in Lore Lindu National Park in central Sulawesi, greatly expanding the known habitat range.|$|R

40|$|Human-Wildlife Conflicts: <b>Hawks</b> and <b>owls</b> can {{negatively}} impact {{a variety}} of human interests, including important natural resources, livestock and game bird production, human health and safety, and companion animals. Conflicts between raptors and people generally are localized and often site-specific. However, {{the economic and social}} impacts to the individuals involved can be severe. Despite the problems they may cause, <b>hawks</b> and <b>owls</b> provide important benefits and environmental services. Raptors are popular with birdwatchers and much of the general public. They also hunt and kill large numbers of rodents, reducing crop damage and other problems. Damage Identification Management Methods Economics Species Overview: Given the number of different <b>hawks</b> and <b>owls</b> in North America, the potential for human-raptor conflict is signifi-cant. The northern goshawk, red-tailed hawk, and great horned owl account for the majority of conflicts between humans and <b>hawks</b> and <b>owls.</b> This publication focuses on these three species, but most of the general biology, na-ture of conflicts, and damage management methods will apply to other <b>hawks</b> and <b>owls.</b> Legal Status: All <b>hawks</b> and <b>owls</b> in the United States are federally pro-tected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 USC, 703 − 711). <b>Hawks</b> and <b>owls</b> typically are protected under state wildlife laws or local ordinances, as well.
