40|$|The flow/acoustic {{environment}} surrounding {{an engine}} nozzle installed on an airplane, say, under the wing, is asymmetric {{due to the}} pylon, the wing and {{the interaction of the}} exhaust jet with flaps on the wing. However, the conventional chevrons, which are azimuthally uniform serrations on the nozzle lip, do not exploit the asymmetry due to these propulsion airframe aeroacoustic interactions to reduce jet noise. In this pioneering study we use this non-axisymmetry to our advantage and examine if the total jet-related noise radiated to the ground can be reduced by using different types of azimuthally varying chevrons (AVC) which vary the mixing around the nozzle periphery. Several scale models of the isolated nozzle, representative of high bypass ratio engine nozzles, were made with a pylon and azimuthally varying chevrons on both fan and <b>core</b> <b>nozzles</b> to enhance mixing at the top (near the pylon) with less mixing at the bottom (away from the pylon) or vice versa. Various combinations of fan and <b>core</b> AVC <b>nozzles</b> were systematically tested at typical take-off conditions inside a free jet wind-tunnel and, here, in Part 1 we analyze the acoustics results for the isolated nozzle with a pylon, with installation effects reported in Parts 2 and 3. Several interesting results are discovered: amongst the fan AVCs the top-enhanced mixing T-fan chevron nozzle is quieter in combination with any <b>core</b> AVC <b>nozzle</b> when compared to conventional chevrons; however, the bottom-mixing B-fan chevrons, as well as the <b>core</b> AVC <b>nozzles,</b> by themselves, are noisier. Further, the low-frequency source strengths in the jet plume, obtained via phased microphone arrays, also corroborate the far field sound, and for the T-fan chevrons such sources move further downstream than those for baseline or conventional chevron nozzles...|$|R

Low frequency acoustic power determined at the <b>core</b> <b>nozzle</b> exit corresponds in level to the far field acoustic power at engine speeds below 65 % of maximum, the approach condition. At engine speeds above 65 % of maximum, the jet noise dominates in the far field, greatly exceeding that of the core.

Experiments were performed for a <b>core</b> <b>nozzle</b> trailing edge thickness between 0. 38 mm and 3. 17 mm. The on-set of discrete tones was found to be predominantly affected by the velocity ratio, the ratio of the fan velocity to the core velocity, although some dependency on trailing edge thickness was also noted. For a <b>core</b> <b>nozzle</b> trailing edge thickness {{greater than or equal to}} 0. 89 mm, tones were produced for velocity ratios between 0. 91 and 1. 61. For a constant nozzle trailing edge thickness, the frequency varied almost linearly with the core velocity. The Strouhal number based on the core velocity changed with nozzle trailing edge thickness and varied between 0. 16 and 0. 2 for the core nozzles used in the experiments. Increases in broadband noise with increasing trailing edge thickness were observed for tone producing and non-tone producing conditions. A variable thickness trailing edge (crenellated) nozzle resulted in no tonal production and a reduction of the broadband trailing edge noise relative to that of the corresponding constant thickness trailing edge.

40|$|Overall {{trends for}} next {{generation}} aero-engines are oriented to more efficient architectures {{to ensure a}} reduction in fuel consumption and an improvement in expected ranges, emissions levels and operability. Engine manufacturers have investigated different ways to improve engine performance, for instance by using new materials, technologies or integration methods. Engine performance can also be improved though changes in thermodynamic cycle by means of variable cycle devices capable of better adapting it to flight conditions. Due to current design constraints, engines are optimized to best average performance for a specific mission type, yet not for all the operating points encountered throughout the missions. By adding a degree of freedom, the cycle can be further optimized during the entire mission potentially leading to additional fuel savings. This paper presents {{an analysis of the}} impact of variable fan and <b>core</b> <b>nozzle</b> areas on the performance of a long range turbofan through a long range mission. By moving the operating points, these devices have a strong effect on engine operations and therefore on the Specific Fuel Consumption. Variations in Specific Fuel Consumption are evaluated as well as compressors surge margins, considered as important performance and operability parameters, throughout the same 14 hours long range mission and for range of +/- 15 % for the fan nozzle area and +/- 20 % for the <b>core</b> <b>nozzle</b> area. This study shows that optimization of the fan nozzle area on each mission point for minimum SFC can lead to fuel savings of up to 20 kg (44 lb) representing 0. 05 % of improvement. However, maximizing the surge margin by optimizing the variable fan nozzle permits an increase of up to 7 % depending on the considered compressor. On the other hand, optimization of the <b>core</b> <b>nozzle</b> area on each mission point for minimum specific fuel consumption allows a reduction of 127 kg (282 lb) in fuel consumption, representing an improvement of 0. 34 % while having different effects on the engine compressors surge margins. Using the core area to maximize the surge margin provides an increase of up to 2 % depending on the considered compressor with a side effect on specific fuel consumption. At this stage, the results from this study suggest that the amount of fuel savings obtained through the use of variable fan nozzle and variable <b>core</b> <b>nozzle</b> may not be sufficient to overcome the associated constraints such as added weight and integration aspects. However, a broader optimization approach,involving all the design aspects and parameters could lead to different quantitative conclusions...|$|E

40|$|Jet engine {{noise is}} an {{environmental}} problem {{that needs to}} be addressed. Several methods to reduce the jet noise have been proposed in the last decades. The main issue is to find methods that reduce noise without causing considerable loss of thrust. Experimental and computational tools are mandatory in successfully reducing jet engine noise emissions. One of the challenging issues of computing the jet engine noise is the presence of very large scales (associated with the wave length of the acoustic wave) {{and at the same time}} also small scales that are responsible for the acoustical sources. In the field of Computational Aero-Acoustics (CAA) different hybrid approaches have been introduced to handle the different scales using problem specific models and methods. Here, a decomposition of flow variables is used that allows separation of flow and acoustic computations. Large Eddy Simulation approach is employed to compute the flow field and the acoustic sources. An inhomogeneous wave equation is used to perform acoustic computations.

40|$|Fluidic chevrons use {{injected}} air {{near the}} trailing {{edge of a}} nozzle to emulate mixing and jet noise reduction characteristics of mechanical chevrons. While previous investigations of "first generation" fluidic chevron nozzles showed only marginal improvements in effective perceived noise levels when compared to nozzles without injection, significant improvements in noise reduction characteristics were achieved through redesigned "second generation" nozzles on a bypass ratio 5 model system. The second-generation <b>core</b> <b>nozzles</b> had improved injection passage contours, external nozzle contour lines, and nozzle trailing edges. The new fluidic chevrons resulted in reduced overall sound pressure levels over that of the baseline nozzle for all observation angles. Injection ports with steep injection angles produced lower overall sound pressure levels than those produced by shallow injection angles. The reductions in overall sound pressure levels were the result of noise reductions at low frequencies. In contrast to the first-generation nozzles, only marginal increases in high frequency noise over that of the baseline nozzle were observed for the second-generation nozzles. The effective perceived noise levels of the new fluidic chevrons are shown to approach those of the core mechanical chevrons...|$|R

40|$|The flow/acoustic {{environment}} {{around the}} jet exhaust of an engine when installed on an airplane, say, under the wing, is highly asymmetric {{due to the}} pylon, the wing and the high-lift devices. Recent scale model tests have shown that such Propulsion Airframe Aeroacoustic (PAA) interactions and the jet mixing noise can be reduced more than with conventional azimuthally uniform chevrons by uniquely tailoring the chevrons to produce enhanced mixing near the pylon. This paper describes the community noise results from a flight test on a large twin-engine airplane using this concept of azimuthally varying chevrons for engines installed under the wing. Results for two different nozzle configurations are described: azimuthally varying "PAA T-fan" chevrons on the fan nozzle with a baseline no-chevron <b>core</b> <b>nozzle</b> and a second with PAA T-fan chevrons with conventional azimuthally uniform chevrons on the <b>core</b> <b>nozzle.</b> We analyze these test results {{in comparison to the}} baseline no-chevron nozzle on both spectral and integrated power level bases. The study focuses on the peak jet noise reduction and the effects at high frequencies for typical take-off power settings. The noise reduction and the absolute noise levels are then compared to model scale results. The flight test results verify that the PAA T-fan nozzles in combination with standard core chevron nozzles can, indeed, give a reasonable amount of noise reduction at low frequencies without high-frequency lift during take-off conditions and hardly any impact on the cruise thrust coefficient...|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{alternating}} fluidic core chevrons {{on the production}} of jet noise is investigated. <b>Core</b> <b>nozzles</b> for a representative 1 / 9 th scale, bypass ratio 5 model system were manufactured with slots cut near the trailing edges to allow for air injection into the core and fan streams. The injectors followed an alternating pattern around the nozzle perimeter so that the injection alternated between injection into the core stream and injection into the fan stream. For the takeoff condition and a forward flight Mach number of 0. 10, the overall sound pressure levels at the peak jet noise angle decrease with increasing injection pressure. Sound pressure levels increase for observation angles less than 110 o at higher injection pressures due to increases in high frequency noise. Greater increases in high frequency noise are observed {{when the number of}} injectors increases from 8 to 12. When the forward flight Mach number is increased to 0. 28, jet noise reduction (relative to the baseline) is observed at aft angles for increasing injection pressure while significant increases in jet noise are observed at forward observation angles due to substantial acoustic radiation at high frequencies. A comparison between inflow and alternating injectors shows that, for equal mass injection rates, the inflow nozzle produces greater low frequency noise reduction (relative to the baseline) than the alternating injectors at 90 o and aft observation angles and a forward flight Mach number of 0. 28. Preliminary computational fluid dynamic simulations indicate that the spatial decay rate of the hot potential core flow is less for the inflow nozzle than for the alternating nozzles which indicates that gentle mixing may be preferred over sever mixing when fluidic chevrons are used for jet noise reduction...|$|R
40|$|The NASA Glenn Research Center {{recently}} completed an experimental study {{to reduce the}} jet noise from modern turbofan engines. The study concentrated on exhaust nozzle designs for high-bypass-ratio engines. These designs modified the core and fan nozzles individually and simultaneously. Several designs provided an ideal jet noise reduction of over 2. 5 EPNdB for the effective perceived noise level (EPNL) metric. Noise data, after correcting for takeoff thrust losses, indicated over a 2. 0 -EPNdB reduction for nine designs. Individually modifying the fan nozzle did not provide attractive EPNL reductions. Designs in which only the <b>core</b> <b>nozzle</b> was modified provided greater EPNL reductions. Designs in which core and fan nozzles were modified simultaneously provided the greatest EPNL reduction. The best nozzle design had a 2. 7 -EPNdB reduction (corrected for takeoff thrust loss) with a 0. 06 -point cruise thrust loss. This design simultaneously employed chevrons on the core and fan nozzles. In comparison with chevrons, tabs {{appeared to be an}} inefficient method for reducing jet noise. Data trends indicate that the sum of the thrust losses from individually modifying core and fan nozzles did not generally equal the thrust loss from modifying them simultaneously. Flow blockage from tabs did not scale directly with cruise thrust loss and the interaction between fan flow and the <b>core</b> <b>nozzle</b> seemed to strongly affect noise and cruise performance.
