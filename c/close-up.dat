5|$|Visually {{based on}} cruise ship members, the five Bon Voyage cover sleeves feature {{different}} images all photographed by Kazuyoshi Shimomura. The CD cardboard sleeve has Koda squatting and holding onto {{a cruise ship}} steering wheel; the jewel case has Koda holding a life buoy. The CD and DVD cardboard sleeve has a <b>close-up</b> shot of Koda wearing a captain's uniform; the jewel case has Koda posing {{on top of a}} life buoy. The Blu-ray cardboard sleeve and jewel case has Koda posing with a pair of binoculars, while the Fan Club edition has a <b>close-up</b> of Koda sitting down holding a cruise ship steering wheel. The digital release uses the CD and DVD <b>close-up</b> shot. The booklet and photo shoot were designed by members of United Lounge Tokyo, and each booklet from the five format features different images of Koda.|$|E
5000|$|The photos he took {{include three}} extreme <b>close-ups</b> of Dalí, plus one of Whitaker's wife Susie basking topless under the Spanish sun {{alongside}} the artist. The extreme <b>close-ups</b> {{were the first}} steps towards a photographic style that he finally developed fully in the 1990s, a concept he called the [...] "Whitograph", shooting extreme <b>close-ups</b> with all 36 exposures of a roll of film to create a single portrait.|$|R

25|$|A Fistful of Dollars {{became the}} first film to exhibit Leone's famously {{distinctive}} style of visual direction. This was influenced by both John Ford's cinematic landscaping and the Japanese method of direction perfected by Akira Kurosawa. Leone wanted an operatic feel to his western, {{and so there are}} many examples of extreme <b>close-ups</b> on the faces of different characters, functioning like arias in a traditional opera. The rhythm, emotion, and communication within scenes can be attributed to Leone’s meticulous framing of his <b>close-ups.</b> This is quite different from Hollywood's use of <b>close-ups</b> that used them as reaction shots, usually to a line of dialogue that had just been spoken. Leone's <b>close-ups</b> are more akin to portraits, often lit with Renaissance-type lighting effects, and are considered by some as pieces of design in their own right.|$|R
5|$|A common {{complaint}} was the noticeable digital airbrushing on numerous <b>close-up</b> shots of Jovovich's face, for which reviewers were confused at the use of, or found unnecessary. The film won the Golden Trailer Award for Best Action Poster and {{was nominated for}} Best TV Spot.|$|E
5|$|In July 2015, {{after nearly}} {{ten years of}} Eris being {{considered}} the ninth-largest object known to directly orbit the sun, <b>close-up</b> imagery from the New Horizons mission more accurately determined Pluto's volume to be slightly larger than Eris's, rather than slightly smaller as previously thought. Eris is now the tenth-largest object known to directly orbit the sun by volume, though not by mass.|$|E

5|$|Sleight of hand (also {{known as}} prestidigitation or legerdemain) refers to fine motor skills when used by {{performing}} artists in different art forms to entertain or manipulate. It is {{closely associated with}} <b>close-up</b> magic, card magic, card flourishing and stealing.|$|E

5|$|The {{miniature}} Enterprise {{was again}} {{used for the}} spacewalk sequence. Even on the large model, {{it was hard to}} make the miniature appear realistic in extreme <b>close-up</b> shots. To make the pullback shot work, the camera had to be within one-eighth of an inch from the model. Painter Kim Smith spent several days on a tiny area of the model to add enough surface detail for the <b>close-up,</b> but even then the focus was barely adequate. To compensate, the crew used a wider-angle lens and shot at the highest f-stop they could. The live-action scenes of the spacewalking crew were then digitally added. Wide shots used footage of photo doubles walking across a large bluescreen draped across ILM's parking lot at night.|$|E

5|$|Acting {{also plays}} a key role in Szabó’s films, as he values {{psychological}} complexity in his central characters. In his first several features, he tended to use the same lead actors over and over—first András Bálint, then Klaus Maria Brandauer. Consistent with this focus on acting, he frequently employs long <b>close-up</b> shots to emphasize the play of emotions on the faces of his characters.|$|E
5|$|Almost a year later, in August 1981, Voyager 2 {{continued}} {{the study of}} the Saturn system. More <b>close-up</b> images of Saturn's moons were acquired, as well as evidence of changes in the atmosphere and the rings. Unfortunately, during the flyby, the probe's turnable camera platform stuck {{for a couple of days}} and some planned imaging was lost. Saturn's gravity was used to direct the spacecraft's trajectory towards Uranus.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1973, several {{spacecraft}} {{have performed}} planetary flyby maneuvers {{that brought them}} within observation range of Jupiter. The Pioneer missions obtained the first <b>close-up</b> images of Jupiter's atmosphere and several of its moons. They discovered that the radiation fields near the planet were much stronger than expected, but both spacecraft managed to survive in that environment. The trajectories of these spacecraft were used to refine the mass estimates of the Jovian system. Radio occultations by the planet resulted in better measurements of Jupiter's diameter {{and the amount of}} polar flattening.|$|E

5|$|Blue Wing Blitz is a {{traditional}} turn-based tactical role-playing game, although it has the particularity of involving mostly aerial warfare units. These are moved on a grid map, and an encounter with an enemy unit opens a separate, <b>close-up</b> combat screen in which up to two ally units and two enemy units engage in a short dogfight; the player using menu commands to attack, change altitude or take evasive maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|McDiarmid {{noticed that}} the script for Revenge of the Sith demanded more action from his {{character}} than in previous films. Lightsaber combat was {{a challenge to the}} 60-year-old actor, who, like his costars, took fencing lessons. The <b>close-up</b> shots and non-acrobatic sequences of the duel between Palpatine and Mace Windu were performed by McDiarmid. Advanced fencing and acrobatic stunts were executed by McDiarmid's doubles, Michael Byrne, Sebastian Dickins, and Bob Bowles.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the films}} {{directed}} by Umboh were romantic melodramas, a genre which had existed in Indonesia since the 1950s but was refined by Umboh. However, he preferred shooting films with a social message; he considered Pengemis dan Tukang Becak his favourite film. When shooting, Umboh minimised his use of master shots, instead preferring to use medium and <b>close-up</b> shots; his obituary in Kompas notes that around 80per cent of any given Umboh film used these latter two shots.|$|E

5000|$|Throughout 1986-2004, Demme {{was known}} for his {{dramatic}} <b>close-ups</b> in films. This style of <b>close-ups</b> involves the character looking directly into the camera during crucial moments, particularly in the [...] "Quid pro quo" [...] scene in Silence of the Lambs. According to Demme, this was done to put the viewer into the character's shoes. Beginning with Rachel Getting Married (2008), Demme adopted a documentary style of filmmaking.|$|R
5|$|On 15January2009, it was {{announced}} that the maxi vinyl, published in a limited edition, and the CD single would be released on 10February, then delayed to 16February. The cover art of the promotional single was entirely red, showing a <b>close-up,</b> the head of the doll which had appeared on Point de suture. The cover of the single, which published on the internet on 27January2009, displayed a photograph by Simon Hawk.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} notable moments in the race came from a near-fatal {{accident}} when stunt man Joe Canutt, Yakima Canutt's son, was tossed into the air by accident; he incurred a minor chin injury. Marton {{wanted to keep the}} shot, but Zimbalist felt the footage was unusable. Marton conceived the idea of showing that Ben-Hur was able to land on and cling to the front of his chariot, then scramble back into the quadriga while the horses kept going. The long shot of Canutt's accident was cut together with a <b>close-up</b> of Heston climbing back aboard, resulting in one of the race's most memorable moments. Boyd did all but two of his own stunts. For the sequence where Messala is dragged beneath a chariot's horses and trampled, Boyd wore steel armor under his costume and acted out the <b>close-up</b> shot and the shot of him on his back, attempting to climb up into the horses' harness to escape injury. A dummy was used to obtain the trampling shot in this sequence.|$|E
5|$|Rock 'n' Roll Circus was {{recorded}} in Japan and the United Kingdom, making it Hamasaki's first album recorded outside of her native country. Additional production was handled in the United States and the two prior countries. Five different formats were released to promote the album: a standalone CD, a CD and DVD bundle, a limited edition box set, a limited edition Playbutton, and a digital release worldwide. Two different artworks were issued for the album's cover sleeve; one has Hamasaki inside a telephone box, while the second sleeve has a <b>close-up</b> of Hamasaki's face.|$|E
