40|$|A {{strategy}} is presented for determining total NOx (NO þ NO 2) in gas streams at temperatures greater than 400 8 C. By using a Pt-loaded zeolite Y as a <b>catalyst</b> <b>filter</b> bed placed before a sensor, NOx {{species in the}} gas stream are brought to an equilibrium concentration of NO and NO 2 that {{is determined by the}} background oxygen concentration and the filter temperature. The equilibrated NOx is then measured with a yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) sensor using a chromium oxide sensing electrode. In the absence of the filter NO and NO 2 produced responses in opposite directions, while {{in the presence of the}} filter, NO and NO 2 gave signals of the same magnitude and direction. By varying the temperature of the filter relative to the sensor, the signal magnitude could be increased. Another advantage of the filter is that CO is oxidized to CO 2 and thus little interference of CO upon NOx was observed. By introducing a layer of the Pt-zeolite <b>catalyst</b> <b>filter</b> material directly onto a Pt electrode, a pseudo-reference to NOx was formed.

40|$|International audienceA new simple process {{based on}} the {{controlled}} dispersion of powders in water to shape millimetric spheres exhibiting a micro/mesoporous structured network is described. A formulation containing latex spheres (d 50 = 4 microns) and titania aggregates (d 50 = 1 micron) is agglomerated by addition of hydrous alumina nanofilaments carrying a high density of positive charges. By selecting the suitable ratios for each raw material, the structure of primary agglomerates consists of core (latex) /shell (titania monolayer) type. The coalescence of such agglomerates in suspension is induced by a continuous rotational movement which forces agglomerate surfaces to interact. The control of the solid surfaces chemistry, which determines the nature and intensity of interactions between the powders, allows to produce cohesive objects with a spherical form.

40|$|The {{external}} and internal mass transfer for a rotating foam stirrer reactor has been studied using the hydrogenation of 3 -methyl- 1 -pentyn- 3 -ol as a model reaction. Catalytic foam stirrers with different number of pores per linear inch (ppi) and washcoating thicknesses are used and their performance are {{described in terms of}} activity and selectivity. The liquid-solid mass transfer does not limit the overall reaction rate when a 20 ppi foam is used. For this catalytic foam stirrer, a kLSaLS value of 0. 2 s- 1 is estimated at 300 rpm. The use of finer pore foam structures is not convenient due to a drastic decrease of catalyst surface refreshment. As a result, the lower kLS value negates the benefit of a larger area (aLS) resulting in a lower liquid-solid mass transfer. The catalyst accessibility is a controlling factor in this fast reaction. The optimal washcoat thickness to avoid diffusion limitations is 5 µm. Gas-liquid mass transfer rate is not a limiting factor. A kGLaGL of 0. 6 s- 1 is measured at 300 rpm by the physical adsorption method. When compared to the conventional slurry reactor, the liquid-solid and the gas-liquid mass transfer rates are 17 and 6 times higher, respectively. However, the intrinsic activity of the foam catalyst is 4. 6 times less than the slurry catalyst prepared with the same palladium loading. This is explained by a difference in palladium dispersion caused by a non homogenous concentration of active sites along the washcoat layer. On the other hand, the less active foam catalyst leads to higher selectivity. The production rate is then increased by mounting more active blades on the stirrer shaft, thus creating more surface area for catalyst deposition while still keeping the high accessibility of a 4 µm washcoat layer. Hence, rotating foam reactors have promising applications for multiphase processes. High mass transfer rates can be easily achieved, <b>catalyst</b> <b>filtering</b> is not longer needed and reusability of the foam catalyst is possible. [...] -...|$|R

The specific combinations of <b>catalysts</b> and <b>filters</b> used in the study to demonstrate the method are currently being explored for use in the energy generation industry to help remove elemental mercury from flue gases. Circular fabric samples were placed in a hardened steel milling vial along with a number of PMMA milling balls.

The fabric samples were then dried and subjected to airflow conditions typical for fabric filters in powerplant baghouses. Weight measurements were used to determine the amount of catalyst retained in the fabric at each stage. Results show that fabric type, number of milling balls used, catalyst powder/fabric mass ratio, particle size and the presence of a solvent can all affect the degree of catalyst loading.

40|$|Brittle porous {{materials}} (BPMs) {{are used for}} battery, fuel cell, <b>catalyst,</b> membrane, <b>filter,</b> bone graft, and pharmacy applications due to the multi-functionality of their underlying porosity. However, {{in spite of its}} technological benefits the effects of porosity on BPM fracture strength and Weibull statistics are not fully understood–limiting a wider use. In this context, classical fracture mechanics was combined with two-dimensional finite element simulations not only to account for pore-pore stress interactions, but also to numerically quantify the relationship between the local pore volume fraction and fracture statistics. Simulations show that even the microstructures with the same porosity level and size of pores differ substantially in fracture strength. The maximum reliability of BPMs was shown to be limited by the underlying pore–pore interactions. Fracture strength of BMPs decreases at a faster rate under biaxial loading than under uniaxial loading. Three different types of deviation from classic Weibull behavior are identified: P-type corresponding to a positive lower tail deviation, N-type corresponding to a negative lower tail deviation, and S-type corresponding to both positive upper and lower tail deviations. Pore-pore interactions result in either P-type or N-type deviation in the limit of low porosity, whereas S-type behavior occurs when clusters of low and high fracture strengths coexist in a fracture data. ...|$|R
