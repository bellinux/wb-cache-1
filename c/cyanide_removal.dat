40|$|Cyanide {{is widely}} present in {{electroplating}} wastewater or metallurgical effluents. In the present study, the electrochemical destruction of cyanide with copper/active carbon fiber (Cu/ACF) composite cathode and Dimensionless Stable Anode (DSA) under alkaline conditions was investigated. Firstly, various cathode materials including stainless steel, ACF, copper plate and Cu/ACF were compared for <b>cyanide</b> <b>removal.</b> <b>Cyanide</b> <b>removal</b> efficiencies {{by the individual}} H 2 O 2 oxidation generated using ACF cathode or individual DSAs anodic oxidation using stainless steel cathode were less than 20 %. Using Cu/ACF as the cathode, the removal efficiency of cyanide was largely improved compared with other cathodes. At the current density of 50. 01 A/m(2) and the geometric area ratio of Cu/ACF= 1 : 2, the concentration of cyanide was lowered from 1. 50 to 0. 07 mM within 90 minutes. Due to the dissolution of copper plate by the cyanide ions, the concentration of copper ions increased rapidly {{at first and then}} decreased with the efficient destruction of cyanide ions. Combined with the SEM-EDX and XPS analysis of the anode surface, it was concluded that the generation of copper oxides occurred at the anode surface, which exhibited catalytic activities for <b>cyanide</b> <b>removal.</b> Meantime, ESR results confirmed the generation of hydroxyl radicals in solution. Hydroxyl radicals generated in the reaction between copper cyanides complexs and H 2 O 2 were responsible for the <b>cyanide</b> <b>removal.</b> Once the <b>cyanide</b> <b>removal</b> was completed, part of the copper ions was reduced and deposited onto the cathode and&# 39;part of the copper ions was deposited onto the anode. Therefore, the next recycle for <b>cyanide</b> <b>removal</b> by copper oxides catalytic oxidation at the anode and the Fenton-like oxidation in the solution began. Cyanate was identified as the only product in this system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

When this method was applied to the treatment of CN and Zn electroplating wastewater, 75 % of CN and 100 % of Zn were synchronously removed by forming a mixture of ZnNi bimetal cyanide complex and NiZnOH.

When TEA and NMN {{were present in the}} lumen, J¹ᵇ (TEA) was depressed initially (T < 8 min). However, at steady-state, the presence of NMN in the lumen appeared to stimulate J¹ᵇ (TEA). This suggests a trans-stimulation effect of NMN on J¹ᵇ (TEA). During some flux experiments tubules were perfused at room temperature (24 °C) and then cooled to 2. 8 °C. Jᵇ¹(TEA) decreased approximately 25 % when compared to control values. This effect was reversible. Other tubules were perfused in the presence of 2. 5 mM sodium cyanide in the perfusate and bath. Cellular concentrations of TEA dropped from 67 to 27 times the bath concentration during Jᵇ¹(TEA) measurements and from 21 to 6 times the mean luminal concentration during J¹ᵇ (TEA) measurements. This indicates that little if any intracellular binding of TEA occurs, as passive accumulation should be 16. 1 times the bath or lumen TEA concentration (assuming a - 70 mV PD). To determine if TEA transport was dependent on the presence of Na⁺, Na⁺ in the bath and perfusate solutions was replaced isosmotically by sucrose. Jᵇ¹(TEA) was not significantly changed in the absence of Na⁺. J¹ᵇ (TEA) decreased to 56 % of control in the absence of Na⁺. This effect was reversible.

Materials and methods: This study has been used from a productive set of 500 w power ultrasound waves in of two frequencies 35 kHz and 130 kHz. Experiments were performed with different initial ratio 1 / 1, 1 / 3 and 1 / 5 and at initial cyanide concentrations varying from 2. 5 to 75 mg/L. in this study, Effects of parameters such as pH; time, initial cyanide concentration, hydrogen peroxide/ cyanide and frequency on removal efficiency of mention processes have been studied. Results: The results of the study showed that the maximum removal efficiency of cyanide had been achieved to 74 % by sonochemical process at frequency of 130 kHz, at time of 90 min, at pH of 11, at initial cyanide concentration of 2. 5 mg/l and with initial ratio of 1 / 5.

The PAN-M-TEDA nanofiber {{before and after}} adsorption of hydrogen cyanide was characterized with Fourier transform infrared microscopy (FTIR). The concentration of hydrogen cyanide passes through the samples was determined by measuring the absorption of hydrogen cyanide in the solution containing indicator via UV-Vis spectroscopy. The results showed that introducing metal salts to PAN nanofiber along with their impregnation with TEDA, significantly increases the adsorption capacity of nanofibrous filter media. The adsorption of hydrogen cyanide over PAN-M-TEDA nanofiber was also studied {{as a function of}} thickness, PAN concentration and TEDA concentration by response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite design. It is found that the highest adsorption capacity can be achieved at thickness 28. 42 mm, PAN concentration 16. 19 w/v % and TEDA concentration 14. 80 w/v %...|$|E

40|$|Utilizing cyanide {{compounds}} in mining and chemical industry {{is one of}} the most important environmental issues due to the acute toxic properties of many cyanide compounds to humans and aquatic life. Cyanide tends to react readily with most other chemical elements, producing a wide variety of toxic, cyanide related compounds. This research was aimed at investigating a feasible and economical technique for the detoxification of cyanide from the tailing effluent of Muteh gold mine in Isfahan, Iran. In this research cyanide detoxification was achieved through the oxidation of cyanide by hydrogen peroxide using various hydrogen peroxide solutions at pH levels between 7 - 13 and temperatures between 12 - 65 °C using copper sulfate as a catalyst. The optimum pH and dose of hydrogen peroxide for complete <b>cyanide</b> <b>removal</b> in the presence of 30 mg/L copper sulfate as a catalyst were determined as 9. 7 and 9. 98 g/L, respectively.

Both devices were dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactors; {{one of them was a}} conventional batch reactor (R 1) and the other one was a coaxial thin falling water film reactor (R 2). A first-order degradation kinetics was proposed for both experiments, obtaining k(R 1) = 0. 5553 min(- 1) and k(R 2) = 0. 7482 min(- 1). The coaxial reactor R 2 yielded a removal of 99 % within only 3 min. Energy efficiencies (G) were calculated, yielding 1. 74 mg kW(- 1) h(- 1) for R 1 and 127. 9 mg kW(- 1) h(- 1) for R 2. When the treatment was applied to industrial wastewaters, cyanide elimination was confirmed, although at a lower rate (above 92 % removal in 90 min with R 2).

30|$|Batch {{studies for}} the removal of phenol and cyanide from the binary {{component}} aqueous solution have been carried out using activated carbon acquired from coconut shell with immobilization of bacterium S. odorifera (MTCC 5700). Optimum conditions for simultaneous biosorption and bioaccumulation of phenol and cyanide were accomplished at CSAC dosage of 30  g/L, pH of 8, and temperature 30  °C with an initial concentration 500  mg/L of phenol and 50  mg/L of cyanide. Under the optimal conditions, maximum phenol and <b>cyanide</b> <b>removal</b> efficiencies were acquired as 71.36 and 88.40  % from simultaneous biosorption and bioaccumulation process. In conclusion, a binary component system was found better than monocomponent biosorption system for the simultaneous elimination of phenol and cyanide using S. odorifera (MTCC 5700) immobilized onto CSAC biosorbent surface. In a binary component system among six multicomponent isotherms, extended Freundlich model indicate a better fit for both phenol and cyanide. Therefore, a synergism effects were exhibited for both phenol and cyanide, in binary component system. Among different kinetic models used in this study, Brouser–Weron–Sototlongo kinetic model as well as Fractal-like mixed first second order kinetic models for phenol and cyanide found appropriate to calculate the adsorption kinetic onto CSAC.
