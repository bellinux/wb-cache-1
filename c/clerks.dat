5|$|Individuals {{or groups}} could {{petition}} at the Castellania through a supplicha; common cases were from practitioners needing {{a license to}} perform their occupation and the poor requesting social benefits. For such purposes and other, the Castellania and related tribunals employed {{the largest number of}} <b>clerks.</b> At one point, the working environment of the <b>clerks</b> had no standard working hours and their outcome received country-wide criticism; this resulted in counter petitions, with the clients requesting efficient service in less waiting time and the <b>clerks</b> requesting increase in wages. By 1780 a bando was introduced to address these issues.|$|E

50|$|A <b>clerk</b> is {{a senior}} {{official}} of many municipal governments in the English-speaking world. In some communities, the position is elected, but in many others, the <b>clerk</b> is appointed to their post. In almost all cases, the actual title of the <b>clerk</b> reflects the type of municipality he or she works for, thus, instead of simply being known as the <b>clerk,</b> the position is generally {{referred to as the}} town <b>clerk,</b> township <b>clerk,</b> city <b>clerk,</b> village <b>clerk,</b> borough <b>clerk,</b> board secretary, or county <b>clerk.</b> Other titles also exist. The office has existed for centuries, though in some places it is now being merged with other positions.|$|R

5|$|Edward {{had such}} trust in his {{chancellor}} and the chancellor's <b>clerks</b> that Burnell and the <b>clerks</b> {{were allowed to}} dispense with the hanaper system, which required fees for sealing charters to be paid into the hanaper department of the Chancery for disbursal. Robert and his <b>clerks</b> were permitted to enjoy the profits from the fees of their office. Burnell was also responsible for the decision to force the Court of Chancery to settle in London, rather than following the king and his court around the country.

5|$|Other offices {{included}} the sworn <b>clerks,</b> the examiners, the clerk to the barons, and the clerk to the King's Remembrancer. There were eight sworn <b>clerks,</b> so called {{because they were}} sworn officers of the court, who held their offices for life and worked under the Remembrancer. Each clerk acted as {{an attorney for the}} parties in court, and every party was required to employ one. The first clerk was known as the First Secondary, and administered oaths out of the Red Book of the Exchequer. The sworn <b>clerks</b> were assisted by 24side <b>clerks,</b> of whom each sworn clerk appointed three. Each side clerk studied under a sworn clerk for five years before practising himself, although under the sworn clerk's name. A side clerk had the chance of being promoted to sworn clerk, first by the Remembrancer and then by the sworn <b>clerks</b> themselves. The examiners were tasked with supervising depositions of witnesses, bringing the witness to a Baron, administering the oath and keeping the files of the depositions. In 1624 it was decided these examiners should be sworn officers of the court, and from then on each Baron had an examiner, who acted in the Baron's name. The office of examiner was dissolved in 1841, when the equity jurisdiction of the Exchequer came to an end. In addition to an examiner, each Baron had at least one clerk, who acted as their private secretary; although not paid, they were authorised to take fees for their work. The Chief Baron had two <b>clerks,</b> while the puisne Barons had one each. The King's Remembrancer also employed a clerk, who was also a secretary. He received no salary and was not a sworn officer of the court, meaning the Remembrancer could have him replaced at any time.|$|E
