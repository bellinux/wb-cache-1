500|$|A PlayStation port {{debuted in}} Japan on March 21, 1997. Ported by Tose and {{published}} by Square, it was designed and directed by Kazuhiko Aoki, supervised by Fumiaki Fukaya, and produced by Akihiro Imai. This version {{is identical to the}} original game, although minor tweaks introduced in the Easytype are present. The most notable changes in the PlayStation release are the inclusion of a full motion video opening and ending sequence, the ability to move quickly in dungeons and towns by holding the <b>Cancel</b> <b>button,</b> and the option of performing a [...] "memo" [...] save anywhere on the world map. On March 11, 1999, this version was released a second time in Japan as part of the Final Fantasy Collection package, which also included the PlayStation versions of Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy VI. Fifty-thousand limited edition copies of the collection were also released and included a Final Fantasy-themed alarm clock.|$|E

2500|$|The OK and <b>Cancel</b> <b>buttons</b> {{on most of}} the Japanese PlayStation {{games are}} {{reversed}} in their North American and European releases. In Japan, the [...] button (maru, right) is used as the OK button, while the [...] button (batsu, wrong) is used as Cancel. North American and European releases have the [...] button or the [...] buttons as the OK button, while either the [...] or the [...] button is used as Cancel (some titles like Xenogears used the [...] <b>button</b> for <b>cancelling</b> actions and selections, along with the PlayStation 2 system browser and the XrossMedia Bar on the PlayStation 3 and the PSP). However, a few games, such as Square's Vagrant Story, Final Fantasy VII (which used the [...] <b>button</b> as <b>cancel)</b> and Final Fantasy Tactics, Namco's Ridge Racer Type 4, and Konami's Metal Gear Solid, use the Japanese button layout worldwide. Some other games, like the Japanese version of Gran Turismo, had used different controls that are similar to North American games. These Japanese button layouts still apply to other PlayStation consoles. This is because in the early years Sony America (SCEA), Sony Europe (SCEE), and Sony Japan (SCEJ) had different development and testing documents (TRCs) for their respective territories.|$|R
500|$|At 17:25 GMT on 7 March 2015, {{a charter}} train {{approached}} Wootton Bassett Junction, where the Great Western Main Line and South Wales Main Line diverge at Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire.

The line speed was [...] [...] The temporary restriction of [...] then in force {{did not apply to}} the train as steam locomotives are restricted to a maximum of [...] on Network Rail (NR) tracks in any event. An emergency brake application occurred on the train after it had passed over the magnet because the driver failed to press the AWS <b>cancelling</b> <b>button</b> within 2.7 seconds. The driver should have allowed the train to come to a stand and contacted the signalman, but he did not. Instead he released the brake by operating the AWS isolating cock after the train's speed had been reduced from [...] to about [...] This action had the effect of isolating the AWS and Train Protection & Warning System (TPWS), and rendering them unable to apply the brakes. Although the driver was permitted to operate the isolating cock under certain fault conditions, he did not follow rulebook protocol or inform the signaller that he had done so.|$|R

50|$|With {{the advent}} of the HP LaserJet 4000 in 1997, the control panel was {{completely}} redesigned. The Shift button, which might have been confusing, was gone. There was a Menu, an Item and a Value button. Each of these might be clicked left of right. There was a Select button, a large green Go button, and a small orange <b>Cancel</b> Job <b>button.</b> Configuration through the control panel was easier and more intuitive: menus could be navigated with the Menu button. Then, items within the menu selected with the Item button. The Value button - which had - (decrease) and + (increase) indications - could be used to select a specific setting or value. The Select button was used to select or confirm a particular choice. The display was adapted to a blue-backlit two-line LCD display.|$|R

50|$|The bike offers four {{engine power}} modes, Sport, Touring, Urban and Enduro. Riders can change power modes with the {{motorcycle}} underway {{by using the}} turn-signal <b>cancel</b> <b>button.</b> Sport and Touring modes provide the full 150 bhp with the Touring mode providing a softer throttle response. Urban and Enduro reduce horsepower to 100 bhp and provide different levels of ABS and traction control accordingly. Riders also {{have the option of}} customizing any of these modes by changing the horsepower, throttle response, ABS and traction control levels using menu items inside the instrument cluster.|$|E
50|$|One further use of SAMs in {{multiples}} is {{to achieve}} instant cancellation of organ registrations either in banks or for the entire organ. Most organs will have a General <b>Cancel</b> <b>button</b> {{for the purpose of}} entire cancellation, whilst at least one style of pipe organ manufactured by the John Compton company in the 20th century uses an ingenious system known as Second Touch Cancel, where each SAM has an extra contact fitted which is operated by depressing any single SAM's tab past its normal 'on' position, and which serves to switch all associated SAMs in its department to the 'off' position.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Digimon Device {{has three}} buttons and one reset button. The buttons are located {{to the right}} of the screen.

The ten-stars speed settings in [...] "Hyper" [...] mode, which were only accessible in the SNES version through a cheat code 4, is available by default in the Genesis version, and a cheat code that allows players to adjust the speed in [...] "Champion" [...] mode as well was added in its place.

This remote had 8 device keys on it; TV, VCR, VID2 (DISC), AUX, AM/FM, PHON, TAPE, and CD.

50|$|Inspection {{service is}} {{designed}} to provide access to the hoistway and car top for inspection and maintenance purposes by qualified elevator mechanics. It is first activated by a key switch on the car operating panel usually labeled 'Inspection', 'Car Top', 'Access Enable' or 'HWENAB'. When this switch is activated the elevator will come to a stop if moving, car calls will be <b>canceled</b> (and the <b>buttons</b> disabled), and hall calls will be assigned to other elevator cars in the group (or canceled in a single elevator configuration). The elevator can now only be moved by the corresponding 'Access' key switches, usually located at the highest (to access the top of the car) and lowest (to access the elevator pit) landings. The access key switches will allow the car to move at reduced inspection speed with the hoistway door open. This speed can range from anywhere up to 60% of normal operating speed on most controllers, and is usually defined by local safety codes.|$|R
