25|$|While it was {{difficult}} for many (such as Hooke) to <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enormous speed of light, Rømer's idea suffered a second handicap in that they were based on Kepler's model of the planets orbiting the Sun in elliptical orbits.

25|$|Wiccans generally, {{as well as}} {{some other}} neopagans, tend to <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{universe}} as polarized into gender opposites of male and female energies. In traditional Wicca, the Horned God and the Goddess are seen as equal and opposite in gender polarity. However, in some of the newer traditions of Wicca, and especially those influenced by feminist ideology, there is more emphasis on the Goddess, and consequently the symbolism of the Horned God is less developed than that of the Goddess.|$|E

25|$|The zipper is {{a popular}} device for {{temporarily}} joining two edges of fabric. Zippers are found on trousers, jeans, jackets, and luggage. Whitcomb L.

Using a hook-and-eye device, Judson intended for this earliest form of the zipper to be used on shoes. He also conceived the idea of the slide fastener mechanism in conjunction with the invention of the zipper. Patents were issued to Judson for the zipper in 1891, 1894, and 1905.|$|E
25|$|In Wicca {{the cycle}} of the seasons is celebrated during eight sabbats called The Wheel of the Year. The {{seasonal}} cycle is imagined to follow {{the relationship between the}} Horned God and the Goddess. The Horned God is born in winter, impregnates the Goddess and then dies during the autumn and winter months and is then reborn by the Goddess at Yule. The different relationships throughout the year are sometimes distinguished by splitting the god into aspects, the Oak King and the Holly King. The relationships between the Goddess and the Horned God are mirrored by Wiccans in seasonal rituals. There is some variation between Wiccan groups as to which sabbat corresponds to which part of the cycle. Some Wiccans regard the Horned God as dying at Lammas, August 1; also known as Lughnasadh, which is the first harvest sabbat. Others may see him dying at Mabon, the autumn equinox, or the second harvest festival. Still other Wiccans <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Horned God dying on October 31, which Wiccans call Samhain, the ritual of which is focused on death. He is then reborn on Winter Solstice, December 21.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Talmudic era <b>conceived</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oral Torah in two {{distinct}} ways.

[...] Second, <b>the</b> Rabbis also <b>conceived</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oral Torah as an interpretive tradition, and not merely as memorized traditions. In this view, the written Torah was seen as containing many levels of interpretation. It was left to later generations, who were steeped in <b>the</b> oral tradition <b>of</b> interpretation to discover those ("hidden") interpretations not revealed by Moses. Instead, Moses was obligated to impart the explanations orally to students, children, and fellow adults. It was thus forbidden to write and publish the Oral Torah.|$|R

25|$|In a 1939 essay titled When Fiction Lives in Fiction, Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges {{described}} Flann O'Brien's masterpiece as follows, I have enumerated many verbal labyrinths, {{but none}} so complex {{as the recent}} book by Flann O'Brien, At Swim-Two-Birds. A student in Dublin writes a novel about the proprietor of a Dublin public house, who writes a novel about the habitués of his pub (among them, the student), who in their turn write novels in which proprietor and student figure along with other writers about other novelists. The book consists of the extremely diverse manuscripts of these real or imagined persons, copiously annotated by the student. At Swim-Two-Birds {{is not only a}} labyrinth; it is a discussion of the many ways to <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Irish novel and a repertory of exercises in prose and verse which illustrate or parody all the styles of Ireland. The magisterial influence of Joyce (also an architect of labyrinths, also a literary Proteus) is undeniable, but not disproportionate in this manifold book. Arthur Schopenhauer wrote that dreaming and wakefulness are the pages of a single book, and that to read them in order is to live, and to leaf through them at random, is to dream. Paintings within paintings and books that branch into other books help us sense this oneness.|$|E

500|$|The Syrian Regional Branch began denouncing Aflaq as a [...] "thief". They {{claimed that}} he had stolen the Ba'athist {{ideology}} from Zaki al-Arsuzi and proclaimed it as his own, with Assad hailing Arsuzi as the principal founder of Ba'athist thought. The Iraqi Regional Branch, however, still proclaimed Aflaq as the founder of Ba'athism. Assad has referred to Arsuzi as the [...] "greatest Syrian of his day" [...] and claimed {{him to be the}} [...] "first to <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ba'ath as a political movement." [...] Aflaq was condemned to death in absentia in 1971 by Assad's government. The Syrian Regional Branch erected a statue in Arsuzi's honour not long after the 1966 coup. Nevertheless, the majority of Ba'ath followers outside Syria still view Aflaq, not Arsuzi, as the principal founder of Ba'athism.|$|E

500|$|The first Beach Boy to hear [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] in a semi-completed {{form was}} Carl Wilson, who had {{previously}} participated in rough guide vocals with Brian for the initial February mix.

500|$|Robert and Evelyn Foehl {{were the}} first to <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hotel. Robert Foehl trained at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles, California. He then bought the Hotel San Marcos in Chandler, Arizona. Following that, he managed the Jokake Inn in Scottsdale. Evelyn Foehl managed the Hacienda del Sol in Tucson {{as one of the few}} women in the hotel business. The two {{established}} a core of investors to build a new hotel on an [...] site in Scottsdale and to design it, they hired Edward L. Varney, one of the most prominent local architects of the time. Varney set the hotel around a central pool lounge and used extended horizontal lines in the wings where rooms included air conditioning for year-round operation, a first for Scottsdale. A curving porte-cochere with abstract Southwestern designs in cast concrete opened onto a high-ceiling lobby which gave guests a [...] "sense of arrival", a feature often used by Frank Lloyd Wright. The tall lobby connected the guests to a restaurant, a lounge, a nightclub, and the central pool. The interior design was conceived and executed by interior architect Thelma Hawkins, the director of Barker Bros. Phoenix Studio of Interior Design. The project was completed on December 20, 1956 at a cost of $1.5million, an amount equivalent to $million in current value.|$|E

500|$|At the time, {{according}} to Burdette, given the traumas of the Great War, Americans were highly sensitive about their national symbols, {{and unwilling to}} allow artists any leeway in interpretation. The Mint, the Treasury, and the Fine Arts Commission began to receive large numbers of letters from the public objecting to the design. De Francisci attempted to defend his design, stating, [...] "with the sword there is the olive branch of peace and {{the combination of the}} two renders it impossible to <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sword as a symbolization of defeat". Baker had left Washington to visit the San Francisco Mint, a transcontinental journey of three days. Acting Mint Director Mary Margaret O'Reilly sent him a telegram on December 23, urgently seeking his approval to remove the sword from the reverse, as had been recommended by Moore and Fraser at a meeting the previous afternoon. Due to the tight timeline for 1921 strikings of the dollar, {{it was not possible to}} await Baker's response, so on the authority of Treasury Undersecretary Seymour Parker Gilbert, who was approached by O'Reilly, the Mint proceeded with the redesign. To satisfy Harding's executive order, the Fine Arts Commission quickly approved the change, and by the time Baker wired his approval on December 24, without being able to see the revisions, Gilbert had already approved the revised design in Secretary Mellon's absence. A press release was issued late on December 24, stating that the broken sword which had appeared on de Francisci's alternate reverse would not appear on the issued coin. In its December 25 edition, the Herald took full credit for the deletion of the broken sword from the coin's design.|$|E
500|$|Madhayamaka Buddhism goes even further, finding {{fault with}} the monist view of physicalist philosophies of mind {{as well in}} that these {{generally}} posit matter and energy as the fundamental substance of reality. [...] Nonetheless, this {{does not imply that}} the cartesian dualist view is correct, rather Madhyamaka regards as error any affirming view of a fundamental substance to reality.In denying the independent self-existence of all the phenomena that make up the world of our experience, the Madhyamaka view departs from both the substance dualism of Descartes and the substance monism—namely, physicalism—that is characteristic of modern science. The physicalism propounded by many contemporary scientists seems to assert that the real world is composed of physical things-in-themselves, while all mental phenomena are regarded as mere appearances, devoid of any reality in and of themselves. Much is made of this difference between appearances and reality.Indeed, physicalism or the idea that matter is the only fundamental substance of reality is explicitly rejected by Buddhism.In the Madhyamaka view, mental events are no more or less real than physical events. In terms of our common-sense experience, differences of kind do exist between physical and mental phenomena. While the former commonly have mass, location, velocity, shape, size, and numerous other physical attributes, these are not generally characteristic of mental phenomena. For example, we do not commonly <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feeling of affection for another person as having mass or location. These physical attributes are no more appropriate to other mental events such as sadness, a recalled image from one’s childhood, the visual perception of a rose, or consciousness of any sort. Mental phenomena are, therefore, not regarded as being physical, {{for the simple reason that}} they lack many of the attributes that are uniquely characteristic of physical phenomena. Thus, Buddhism has never adopted the physicalist principle that regards only physical things as real.|$|E
