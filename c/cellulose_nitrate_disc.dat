40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The work in {{this thesis}} {{involves}} the development of specimen preparation techniques for the observation with an electron microscope of alpha particle tracks in <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> plastic. Both direct observation using thin films and replica production techniques were investigated. Direct observation of the alpha tracks was accomplished by cutting thin sections of the irradiated plastic with an ultramicrotome. A method for casting very thin films of the <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> for alpha track observation was also developed. Replica techniques which were developed include the single stage Formvar, single stage carbon and double stage carbon replicas. Each of these techniques are explained in detail. Although these techniques were developed using alpha particle irradiations of <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate,</b> applications involving other charged particle tracks could easily use the same procedures. The casting of thin films of <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> for direct observations of the tracks {{and the production of}} a double stage replica of the <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> surface have both resulted in excellent electron microscope beam images without destroying the original plastic or particle tracks. With further development effort, it is thought that these two techniques will allow observation of alpha tracks in <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> on the order of 100 [superscript o]A in diameter...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> (circa 1889 - circa 1950) is {{the first}} of film supports. It can be found as roll film, motion picture film, and sheet film.

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} {{for the analysis of}} D/H ratios of non-exchangeable hydrogen in plant cellulose. Plant samples are nitrated at low temperature and pure <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> is extracted by acetone dissolution. Tests of this nitrated product have demonstrated that the nitration-extraction procedure eliminates the OH hydrogen and does not alter the D/H ratio of the cellulose carbon-bound hydrogen. Significant differences exist between δD values of plant total hydrogen and δD values of <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> hydrogen. This difference is due to the effect of chemical heterogeneity of the δD value of plant material. Plant-extracted <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> D/H ratios are systematically related to the D/H ratios of the associated environmental water. The overall relationship is linear with slope of one and intercept of − 22 %. Five aquatic plants which grew at 16 – 17 °C are related isotopically to the water by a linear curve with a slope of 1 and intercept of − 36 %. Three plants which grew at 28 – 29 °C have an intercept of − 11 %. The general dependence of plant cellulose non-exchangeable hydrogen D/H ratios on the D/H ratios of the associated environmental water suggests that variations of the extracted <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> δD values of plants can be used as indicators of climatic change...|$|R

C 3 plants had the highest compensation points, followed by hybrids, C 3 /C 4 intermediates, and C 4 plants. δ 13 C values of <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> and saponifiable lipids from C 4 plants were about 10 ‰ higher than those observed for <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> and saponifiable lipids of C 3 /C 4 intermediates, hybrids, and C 3 plants.

There was substantial variability in the δD values of <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> among the plants studied. In contrast, such variability was not observed in δD values of water distilled from the leaves, nor in the δD values of the saponifiable lipids. Variability in δD values of <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> from C 3 /C 4 intermediates, hybrids, C 3, and C 4 plants is due to fractionations occurring during biochemical reactions specific to leaf carbohydrate metabolism...|$|R

40|$|Physiological and isotopic {{aspects of}} several Peperomia species were investigated. All but one species had C 3 -like stomatal behavior, in that stomata were open {{during the day}} and closed during the night. In these species, most {{atmospheric}} CO 2 uptake occurred during the day. Concurrent with this stomatal behavior, there were Crassulacean acid metabolism-like acid fluctuations in most species. Carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios of <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> from Peperomia reflect their physiological behavior. The δ 13 C values of <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> from Peperomia species were similar to values observed in C 3 plants and consistent with the daytime uptake of exogeneous CO 2 via the C 3 photosynthetic pathway. The δD values of <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> from Peperomia species approach those of Crassulacean acid metabolism plants. These elevated δD values are caused by fractionations occurring during biochemical reactions and not as a consequence of water relations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCellulose nitrate (or nitrocellulose) has {{received}} considerable interest {{due to its}} uses in various applications, such as paints, photographic films and propellants. However, it is considered {{as one of the}} primary pollutants in the energetic material industries because it can be degraded to form polluting chemical species. In this work, the UV light degradation of <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> films was studied under conditions of artificially accelerated photooxidation. To eliminate the reactivity of nitro groups, the degradation of ethylcellulose was also investigated. Infrared spectroscopy analyses of the chemical modifications caused by the photooxidation of <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> films and the resulting formation of volatile products revealed the occurrence of de-nitration and the formation of oxidation photoproducts exhibiting lactone and anhydride functions. The impact of these chemical modifications on the mechanical and thermal properties of <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> films includes embrittlement and lower temperatures of ignition when used as a propellant...|$|R
50|$|A {{synthetic}} varnish, <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate,</b> {{was developed}} in the 1850s but was not available in a formulation suitable for commercial furniture until the late 1920s. Unfortunately, <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> discolors and becomes brittle as it ages, so over time, the coating on furniture can turn yellow and opaque. It can also crisscross in some places by a fine network of cracks or the varnish can fall off completely. The early date and rarity of this original coating makes it important to retain the varnish on furniture despite these problems.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1860s, an American, John Wesley Hyatt, {{acquired}} Parkes's {{patent and}} began experimenting with <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> {{with the intention}} of manufacturing billiard balls, which until that time were made from ivory.

With assistance from Peter Kinnear and other investors, Hyatt formed the Albany Billiard Ball Company (1868-1986) in Albany, New York, to manufacture the product. In 1870, John and his brother Isaiah patented a process of making a [...] "horn-like material" [...] with the inclusion of <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> and camphor.

40|$|<b>Cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> polymer was {{produced}} from sawdust of Nigeria origin using a method, which involved alternate alkaline and chlorination treatment to remove non-cellulosic constituents, followed by nitration reaction. The effects of nitrating acid mixture type and composition, nitrating time and nitrating acid mixture to cellulose material ratio on yield and solubility of products were investigated.

Variation {{in the composition}} of a particular nitrating acid mixture, relative acid strength of the nitrating mixture, nitrating time and proportion of <b>nitrating</b> acid to <b>cellulose</b> material all influenced the yield and solubility of <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> whose nitrogen contents ranged from 11. 06 to 13. 12 %.

40|$|To {{achieve a}} {{reliable}} radiocarbon (14 C) date for an object, any contamination {{that may be}} of a different age must be removed prior to dating. Samples that have been conserved with treatments such as adhesives, varnishes or consolidants can pose a particular challenge to 14 C dating. At the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit (ORAU), common examples of such substances encountered include shellac, the acrylic polymers Paraloid B- 67 and B- 72, and vinyl acetate-derived polymers (e. g. PVA). Here, a non-carbon-containing absorbent substrate called Chromosorb® was deliberately contaminated {{with a range of}} varieties or brands of these conservation treatments, as well as two <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> lacquers. A selection of chemical pretreatments was tested for their efficiency at removing them. While the varieties of shellac and Paraloid tested were completely removed with some treatments (water/methanol and acetone/methanol/chloroform sequential washes, respectively), no method was found that was capable of completely removing any of the vinyl acetate-derived materials or the <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> lacquers. While Chromosorb is not an exact analog of archaeological wood or bone, for example, this study suggests that {{it may be possible to}} remove aged shellac and Paraloid from archaeological specimens with standard organic solvent-acid-base-acid pretreatments, but it may be significantly more difficult to remove vinyl acetate-derived polymers and <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> lacquers sufficiently to provide reliable 14 C dates. The four categories of conservation treatment studied demonstrate characteristic FTIR spectra, while highlighting subtle chemical and molecular differences between different varieties of shellac, Paraloid and <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> lacquers, and significant differences between the vinyl acetate derivatives...|$|R

30|$|Deterioration of {{polymeric}} objects can {{manifest itself}} in many ways. Materials can change colour, become physically deformed and fragile or may break apart into hundreds of smaller pieces. An additional problem {{that should not}} be underestimated is that during the deterioration process volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are often emitted {{from the surface of the}} object as it degrades. These VOCs, if acidic, can further exacerbate the object’s chemical decay pathway (e.g. inducing an auto-catalytic degradation cycle) or it could induce the corrosion of metal or calcareous objects held in close proximity to the degrading polymer [8]. <b>Cellulose</b> acetate, <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> and PVC are materials which are known to emit acetic acid, nitric acid or hydrochloric acids, respectively, during degradation [9 – 12]. For example, conservators at the British Museum were alerted to nitric acid emission from a <b>cellulose</b> <b>nitrate</b> shadow puppet when the tissue paper used to pack the puppet became increasingly yellow and brittle to the touch [13]. In addition, the metal rivets which held the puppet together were corroded and the legs of the puppet had become severely crazed.
