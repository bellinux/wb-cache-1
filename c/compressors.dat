5|$|Because the {{province}} {{has a great}} potential for aqua-marine development, {{the province}} implemented a coastal and resource management program.

5|$|Fusible plugs are {{sometimes}} fitted to the receivers of air <b>compressors</b> {{as a precaution}} against the ignition of any lubricating oil vapour that might be present.

5000|$|The IP <b>compressor</b> outlet {{corrected}} flow must match the entry {{corrected flow}} of the HP <b>compressor,</b> which is decreasing as the engine is throttled back. At a certain IP <b>compressor</b> working line slope, the IP <b>compressor</b> outlet corrected flow remains constant. However, by adopting a shallower working line, the extra IP <b>compressor</b> pressure ratio at a given IP <b>compressor</b> entry corrected flow enables the IP <b>compressor</b> outlet corrected flow to decrease and match up with the falling HP <b>compressor</b> entry corrected flow. Unfortunately {{this can lead to}} a poor IP <b>compressor</b> surge margin at part flow.|$|R

5|$|By July 1929 {{the last}} of the {{superstructure}} had been cleared, and Bremse was turned upside down using techniques developed on salvaging some of the destroyers. <b>Compressors</b> were then used to pump air into the hull and bring her to the surface, while she was supported by 9-inch wires attached to two floating docks anchored on her port shoreward side. The salvage teams had almost raised her when she suddenly toppled onto her side and then heeled over gradually during the night, settling onto the rocks inshore.|$|E

These are more reliable than A-clamps because the O-ring is well protected, but many countries do not use DIN fittings widely on <b>compressors,</b> or cylinders which have DIN fittings, so a diver traveling abroad with a DIN system may need to take an adaptor, either for connecting the DIN regulator to a rented cylinder, or for connecting an A-clamp filler hose to a DIN cylinder valve.|$|E
40|$|A linear <b>compressor</b> for a {{domestic}} refrigerator-freezer has {{energy saving potential}} compared with a reciprocating <b>compressor</b> because of a low friction loss and free piston system. A linear <b>compressor</b> can control the piston stroke since {{it does not have}} mechanical restriction of piston movement. Therefore, the energy consumption of {{a domestic}} refrigerator-freezer using a linear <b>compressor</b> can be reduced by changing the cooling capacity of the <b>compressor.</b> In order to investigate the performance of a refrigerator-freezer with parallel evaporators using a linear <b>compressor</b> and the relation between cooling capacity of the linear <b>compressor</b> and cooling load, experimental simulation is conducted with variation of the capacity of a linear <b>compressor,</b> an ambient temperature, and cooling load. In addition, the power consumption of a linear <b>compressor</b> is compared to that of an inverter reciprocating <b>compressor</b> in a refrigerator-freezer. The performance of a linear <b>compressor</b> is measured with variation of the capacity of a linear <b>compressor</b> from 60 % to 100 % of the maximum capacity in a refrigerator-freezer. Based on the experimental data, the power consumption of a linear <b>compressor</b> is reduced by 22. 4 % with 70 % capacity compared to 100 % but on-time ratio is increased by 12. 8 %...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to characterize experimentally and by modelling an electrically driven automotive scroll <b>compressor.</b> The experimental characterization is carried out through 13 tests at <b>compressor</b> speeds varying between 3000 and 5000 rpm.

The experimental results are used to identify the parameters of a semi-empirical <b>compressor</b> model, which is able to predict with an acceptable accuracy the main outputs of the mathematical model: confidence limits on the exhaust temperature of ± 1. 0 K, on the refrigerant flow rate of ± 2 g s- 1 and on the <b>compressor</b> power of ± 60 W.

5|$|Deliveries of 1972 stock enabled 1938 {{stock to}} be withdrawn, and several cars were {{converted}} {{for use as}} ballast motor cars. The task was more complicated than for earlier stock, as 1938 units had <b>compressors</b> mounted on the trailer cars. The motor cars therefore had to be fitted with <b>compressors,</b> and the couplings were changed from Wedgelock to Ward type. The first four were numbered L140 to L143, and the conversion was carried out at Acton Works in 1972. Another six were converted, two in 1975, two in 1976, and the final two in 1977, which were numbered L144 to L149. L151 and L152 were converted in 1978, and were additionally fitted with weed killing equipment. Another four were added in the same year, numbered L153 to L156. Although the ballast motor cars were normally worked in pairs, some engineering trains had a ballast motor car {{at one end and}} a battery locomotive at the other. One advantage of the ballast motor cars over battery locomotives was that the interiors could be used by personnel and for storing small tools, although they were less powerful, and could only work when the traction current was switched on. By 2002, all except the weed killing pair had been withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{should only}} be filled with suitably filtered air from diving air <b>compressors</b> or with other breathing gases using gas blending or decanting techniques. In some jurisdictions, suppliers of breathing gases are required by legislation to periodically test the quality of compressed air produced by their equipment and to display the test results for public information. The standards for industrial gas purity and filling equipment and procedures may allow some contaminants at levels unsafe for breathing, and their use in breathing gas mixtures at high pressure could be harmful or fatal.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{is useful}} in the {{manufacture}} of chemical equipment on account of its low chemical reactivity, high thermal conductivity, and being easily workable. Silver crucibles (alloyed with 0.15% nickel to avoid recrystallisation of the metal at red heat) are used for carrying out alkaline fusion. Copper and silver are also used when doing chemistry with fluorine. Equipment made to work at high temperatures is often silver-plated. Silver and its alloys with gold are used as wire or ring seals for oxygen <b>compressors</b> and vacuum equipment.|$|E

5|$|Direct {{geothermal}} heating systems contain pumps and <b>compressors,</b> which may consume energy from a polluting source. This parasitic load is normally {{a fraction of}} the heat output, so it is always less polluting than electric heating. However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the net emissions of {{geothermal heating}} may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a combined cycle natural gas plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas condensing furnace of the same size. Therefore, the environmental value of direct geothermal heating applications is highly dependent on the emissions intensity of the neighboring electric grid.|$|E
5|$|It was {{powered by}} two {{turbofan}} engines with each {{in a separate}} engine nacelle with S-ducts, to shield engine axial <b>compressors</b> from radar waves, {{on either side of}} the aircraft's spine. Of the two aircraft built, the first YF-23 (PAV-1) was fitted with Pratt & Whitney YF119 engines, while the second (PAV-2) was powered by General Electric YF120 engines. The aircraft featured fixed engine nozzles, instead of thrust vectoring nozzles as on the YF-22. As on the B-2, the exhaust from the YF-23's engines flowed through troughs lined with heat-ablating tiles to dissipate heat and shield the engines from infrared homing (IR) missile detection from below.|$|E
5|$|Located at the {{junction}} of Sungei Road and Pitt Road, was the former site of the Singapore Ice Works that {{was built in the}} 1930s. The factory was the first ice-making plant in Singapore using large <b>compressors</b> manufactured mainly from Carrier and York corporations. It was popular as a pioneer establishment that brought refrigeration and air-conditioning to Singapore. In 1958, it was renamed as the New Singapore Ice Works. In later years, the factory was bought over by Cold Storage who ran it under their management. However, in 1984, the Housing Development Board (HDB) took over its site for redevelopment. The factory was soon demolished and the plant operations was re-located to Auric Pacific at Fishery Port Road. This facility has since closed down after being in use for over twenty years.|$|E

5|$|The sound {{equipment}} {{was provided by}} Showco who used the PRISM system, which adapted the show for each venue according to its height, width and the coverage required. The sound was mixed by Front of house engineer Monty Lee Wilkes {{on a combination of}} Yamaha PM4000 and PM3000 consoles, an unusual choice for Spears's shows. He used dbx 903 <b>compressors</b> for kick and snare drums. The <b>compressors</b> were also used on Spears's microphones, a Shure Beta 58A handheld and a Crown CM-311AE headset-mounted capsule. Spears's vocals were mostly live—pre-recorded vocals ran in parallel on an ADAT machine during the shows, and were used to replace her live microphone when the dance routines became too energetic for good voice control. Spears's band, backline technicians and monitor engineer Raza Sufi were all fitted with in-ear monitors and headset mics, enabling rapid and clear communications around the stage area. Spears did not use them, preferring the ambient sound of a battery of eight Showco SRM wedges spread across the downstage area. These were augmented by Showco SS full-range sidefills and a pair of one-by-18-inch subs {{on each side of the}} stage. Sufi also used a dbx 160A to limit Spears's louder moments, while backing vocalists were controlled by a duo of BSS DPR901 dynamic equalizers. Effects were limited to vocal and drum reverbs. Amplification for the wedges and the FOH system were all Crown-based, with a pair of drum stool shakers completing the line-up. All the cables used during the tour were brought from the US, even in Europe, something unusual in audio production.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{electrical}} plant {{construction and}} well drilling cost about €2–5million perMW of electrical capacity, while the break–even price is 0.04–0.10€ perkW·h. Enhanced geothermal systems {{tend to be}} on the high side of these ranges, with capital costs above $4million perMW and break–even above $0.054 perkW·h in 2007. Direct heating applications can use much shallower wells with lower temperatures, so smaller systems with lower costs and risks are feasible. Residential geothermal heat pumps with a capacity of 10kilowatt (kW) are routinely installed for around $1–3,000 perkilowatt. District heating systems may benefit from economies of scale if demand is geographically dense, as in cities and greenhouses, but otherwise piping installation dominates capital costs. The capital cost of one such district heating system in Bavaria was estimated at somewhat over 1million€ perMW. Direct systems of any size are much simpler than electric generators and have lower maintenance costs perkW·h, but they must consume electricity to run pumps and <b>compressors.</b> Some governments subsidize geothermal projects.|$|E
5|$|The Age of Plastic had {{a budget}} of £60,000.
