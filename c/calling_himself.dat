5|$|In 1989, Rothbard {{left the}} Libertarian Party and began {{building}} bridges to the post-Cold War anti-interventionist right, <b>calling</b> <b>himself</b> a paleolibertarian, a conservative reaction against the cultural liberalism of mainstream libertarianism. Paleolibertarianism sought {{to appeal to}} disaffected working class whites through a synthesis of cultural conservatism and libertarian economics.|$|E
5|$|During September 1909, a Japanese <b>calling</b> <b>himself</b> 'Nobu Taka' {{arrived in}} Mexico City {{for the purpose}} of {{challenging}} Maeda for what the Mexican Herald said would be the world jujutsu championship. After several months of public wrangling, Taka and Maeda met at the Colon Theater on November 16, 1909; Taka won. There was an immediate rematch, and four days later, Maeda was pronounced the champion. It was later revealed that Taka was, in fact, Maeda's old friend, Soishiro Satake.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Magnúss saga lagabœtis, Erik <b>called</b> <b>himself</b> [...] "Eirek allz-ekki" [...] {{because he}} had no title. Only when Magnus III became king did Erik change his title and <b>call</b> <b>himself</b> [...] "Duke".|$|R
5000|$|Luc Dierrieckx / Marc Herman: In {{the first}} Stuuût he <b>called</b> <b>himself</b> Luc Dierrieckx (the same {{character}} {{he played the}} TV Tor traps {{before going to the}} RTBF for his first Stuuût). In the others he <b>calls</b> <b>himself</b> in the two ways.|$|R

5|$|Kaye {{originally}} {{worked as}} a high-school teacher while beginning a career in professional wrestling. He joined WWE in mid-2005. His wrestling character drew inspiration from his previous job, as Kaye, now <b>calling</b> <b>himself</b> Matt Striker, quickly developed the persona of a heel (villainous) teacher. In 2008, Striker began working as a color commentator for WWE's ECW brand and then SmackDown brand. After leaving the WWE in 2013, {{he worked on the}} independent circuit before joining Lucha Underground as a commentator.|$|E
5|$|After seeing {{success with}} the mouse using lizard DNA, Ratha demands Connors begin human trials immediately. Connors refuses to rush the drug-testing {{procedure}} and put innocent people at risk. Ratha fires Connors and decides to test Connors' serum at a Veterans Administration hospital {{under the guise of}} a flu shot. In an act of desperation, Connors tries the formula on himself. After passing out, he awakens to find his missing arm has regenerated. Discovering that Ratha {{is on his way to}} the VA hospital, Connors, whose skin is turning green and scaly, goes to intercept him. By the time he gets to the Williamsburg Bridge, Connors has become a violent hybrid of lizard and man, tossing cars, including Ratha's, over the side. Peter, now <b>calling</b> <b>himself</b> Spider-Man, snatches each falling car with his web-lines.|$|E
5|$|As {{he makes}} his way further down the city, Foster {{eventually}} arrives in the abandoned subway tunnels. There he discovers that LINC has grown exponentially, {{to the point where he}} is now half-machine, half-organic entity. However, in order to function, LINC needs a human host to share its brain. The current host is Foster's biological father, who is old and has become severely worn out from his symbiosis with LINC. It is revealed that LINC sent for Foster because, with the death of its current host inevitable, it needed a replacement, and only a blood relative would do. Foster ultimately defeats LINC by plugging Joey (now <b>calling</b> <b>himself</b> Ken) into the mainframe. Joey/Ken is able to take control of the system, and he and Foster set about turning Union City into a utopia.|$|E

60|$|This {{project was}} no sooner propounded, but was as highly accepted, and forward were all Diabolonians now {{to engage in}} so {{delicate}} an enterprise: {{but it was not}} thought fit that all should do thus; wherefore they pitched upon two or three, namely, the Lord Covetousness, the Lord Lasciviousness, and the Lord Anger. The Lord Covetousness <b>called</b> <b>himself</b> by the name of Prudent-Thrifty; the Lord Lasciviousness <b>called</b> <b>himself</b> by the name of Harmless- Mirth; and the Lord Anger <b>called</b> <b>himself</b> by the name of Good-Zeal.|$|R
5|$|Cagliostro's Egyptian Rite In 1784, in Bordeaux, the man <b>calling</b> <b>himself</b> Count Alessandro di Cagliostro {{opened the}} first lodge of his Egyptian Rite masonry. This had the three degrees of normal French masonry (Apprentice, Companion and Master), {{but with a}} greatly different, more mystical ritual. Cagliostro claimed that he was re-introducing true Freemasonry, and he {{attempted}} to attract candidates wherever he went. Male candidates were already Freemasons, but women were also admitted. The ceremony for the two sexes differed only in minor points - males were admitted by Cagliostro (the Grand Copht) and females by his wife (the Queen of Sheba). On admission, the women {{were told that they}} were now Freemasons.|$|E
5|$|<b>Calling</b> <b>himself</b> Anders, and feigning {{an injured}} leg, Kator is {{taken in by}} Jessica and Jo. His arrival {{immediately}} causes friction between the two. Bored of her monotonous existence, Jessica welcomes the stranger's arrival. Jo, however, openly resents his presence and suggests that the socially-awkward Anders is an escapee from a psychiatric hospital (which she is herself). Later, having returned {{to the spot where}} he killed Anderson and Sandy, Kator kills and partly devours two policemen who are examining the couple's abandoned car. Back at the house, Jessica finds a knife and bloodstained clothes in a spare bedroom; recognising the latter as Simon's, she realises that he was murdered by Jo.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1840s, Mary Shelley {{found herself}} {{the target of}} three {{separate}} blackmailers. In 1845, an Italian political exile called Gatteschi, whom she had met in Paris, threatened to publish letters she had sent him. A friend of her son's bribed a police chief into seizing Gatteschi's papers, including the letters, which were then destroyed. Shortly afterwards, Mary Shelley bought some letters written by herself and Percy Bysshe Shelley from a man <b>calling</b> <b>himself</b> G. Byron and posing as the illegitimate son of the late Lord Byron. Also in 1845, Percy Bysshe Shelley's cousin Thomas Medwin approached her claiming to have written a damaging biography of Percy Shelley. He said he would suppress it in return for £250, but Mary Shelley refused.|$|E

50|$|According to the Reinhardsbrunn Chronicle by monk, Johannes Caput, from Ilfeld Abbey an Elger of Bilstein on the Werra {{built the}} Ilburg and <b>called</b> <b>himself</b> the Count of Ilfeld. In 1162 a nobleman of Ilfeld married Lutrude of Hohnstein and <b>called</b> <b>himself</b> {{thereafter}} Ilfeld-Hohnstein and, from 1182, just von Hohnstein.|$|R
5|$|Koss {{arrives on}} board Enterprise {{to speak to}} his wife, T'Pol. He gives her an IDIC pendant from her mother, who he {{explains}} is also a Syrrannite. The pendant projects a map showing a path across a desert on Vulcan called “the Forge”, which Archer believes will lead them to both T'Pau and T'Pol's mother. T'Pol and Archer leave the ship and begin to make the crossing, following the map. They soon encounter another traveller, <b>calling</b> <b>himself</b> Arev, who assists, but remains distrustful of them. A sand-fire storm kills Arev, but before he dies, he forcefully performs a mind meld with Archer to transfer his katra. After burying him, a focussed Archer leads T'Pol directly to the concealed T'Karath Sanctuary, where they are quickly captured.|$|E
5|$|From 1807 to 1809, Champollion {{studied in}} Paris, under Silvestre de Sacy, the first Frenchman {{to attempt to}} read the Rosetta stone, and with orientalist Louis-Mathieu Langlès, and with Raphaël de Monachis who was now in Paris. Here he perfected his Arabic and Persian, in {{addition}} to the languages that he had already acquired. He was so immersed in his studies that he took up the habit of dressing in Arab clothing and <b>calling</b> <b>himself</b> Al Seghir, the Arab translation of le jeune. He divided his time between the College of France, the Special School of Oriental Languages, the National Library where his brother was a librarian and the Commission of Egypt, the institution in charge of publishing the findings of the Egyptian expedition. In 1808, he first began studying the Rosetta stone, working from a copy made by the Abbé de Tersan. Working independently he was able to confirm some of the readings of the demotic previously made by Johan David Åkerblad in 1802, finally identifying the Coptic equivalents of fifteen demotic signs present on the Rosetta stone.|$|E
5|$|Long's {{strategy}} of proclaiming {{himself as a}} royal descendent or claiming to have supernatural powers in order to rally support for political ends was not new; it has been repeatedly used throughout Vietnamese history. In 1516, a man <b>calling</b> <b>himself</b> Trần Cảo rebelled against the Lê Dynasty, claiming to be a descendant of the deposed Trần Dynasty and a reincarnation of Indra. During the 19th century, there was a Buddhist revival and many people masqueraded as monks claiming to have supernatural powers. These false monks were frequently able to start new religious movements and secret societies based on millenarianism. Quickly gathering large numbers of disciples, they staged rebellions against Vietnamese imperial and French colonial armies alike. However, these uprisings were typically incoherent and caused minimal disruption to the ruling authorities. On the other hand, the French were often troubled by resistance movements in southern Vietnam that were led by more conventionally motivated nationalist militants, such as the guerrilla outfits of Trương Định and Nguyễn Trung Trực.|$|E

5|$|The {{second season}} {{featured}} numerous guest stars. Michael Emerson portrayed a man <b>calling</b> <b>himself</b> Henry Gale, who is suspected {{to be one}} of the Others, a group of mysterious island inhabitants who terrorize the survivors. L. Scott Caldwell returned to play Rose Henderson, while Sam Anderson joined the cast playing her husband, Bernard Nadler. Kimberley Joseph returns as flight attendant Cindy, having appeared in the pilot episode. Henry Ian Cusick portrayed Desmond Hume, a man who had been living in the hatch for three years. M. C. Gainey played the Other named Tom and Tania Raymonde played the Other named Alex. John Terry appeared in numerous flashbacks as Jack's father, Christian Shephard. François Chau appeared in orientation films for the Dharma Initiative. Clancy Brown acted as Desmond's companion in the hatch, Kelvin Inman. Katey Sagal appeared throughout the season as Helen, Locke's love interest who gets caught between his pugnacious relationship with his father.|$|E
5|$|Its royal {{occupant}} {{may very}} well have made York House the pinnacle of Brettingham's career. Built during the 1760s, it was one of his last grand houses. His last country-house commission was at Packington Hall, Warwickshire. In 1761, he published his plans of Holkham Hall, <b>calling</b> <b>himself</b> the architect, which led critics, including Horace Walpole, to decry him as a purloiner of Kent's designs. Brettingham died in 1769 at his house outside St. Augustine's Gate, Norwich, and was buried in the aisle of the parish church. Throughout his long career, Brettingham did much to popularise the Palladian movement. His clients included a Royal Duke and at least twenty-one assorted peers and peeresses. He is not a household name today largely because his provincial work was heavily influenced by Kent and Burlington, and unlike his contemporary Giacomo Leoni he did not develop, or was not given the opportunity to develop, a strong personal stamp to his work on country houses. Ultimately, he and many of his contemporary architects were eclipsed by the designs of Robert Adam. Adam remodelled Brettingham's York House in 1780 and, in addition to Kedleston Hall, went on to replace James Paine as architect at Nostell Priory, Alnwick Castle, and Syon House. In spite of this, Adam and Paine remained great friends; Brettingham's relationships with his fellow architects are unrecorded.|$|E
5|$|The IRA {{immediately}} began {{making plans to}} break Twomey, O'Hagan and Mallon out of the prison. The first attempt involved explosives that had been smuggled into the prison, which were {{to be used to}} blow a hole in a door which would give the prisoners access to the exercise yard. From there, they would scale a rope ladder thrown over the exterior wall by members of the IRA's Dublin Brigade who would have a getaway car waiting to complete the escape. The plan failed when the prisoners could not gain access to the exercise yard and the rope ladder was spotted, so the IRA began making new escape plans. The idea of using a helicopter in an escape had been discussed before, an idea to break Gerry Adams out of Long Kesh internment camp had been ruled out because of faster and more sophisticated British Army helicopters being stationed at a nearby base. The IRA's GHQ staff approved the plan to break out Twomey, O'Hagan and Mallon, and arrangements were made to obtain a helicopter. A man with an American accent <b>calling</b> <b>himself</b> Mr. Leonard approached the manager of Irish Helicopters at Dublin Airport, with a view to hiring a helicopter for an aerial photographic shoot in County Laois. After being shown the company's fleet of helicopters, Leonard arranged to hire a five-seater Alouette II for 31 October.|$|E
