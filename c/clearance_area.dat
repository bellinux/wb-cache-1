Also, as noted by a biography on Morrison, the opposition attacked Morrison “for the deliberate injection of LCC housing into previous Tory strongholds.” The standard of the houses was improved, with more facilities and bigger sizes, and Morrison’s administration also scrapped the Municipal Reform tenement where one bathroom was shared by three families. More capital expenditure was allocated towards the LCC housing programme, new flats and houses were built more quickly, and rents were reduced for tenants coming from the slums, “who often found the increased rents difficult to bear when they were rehoused.” ...|$|R

50|$|In {{accordance}} to the government's Poverty Alleviation Program, the {{oil palm}} project proceeded with 42.5 km2 of <b>clearance</b> <b>area,</b> but the project caused major forest destruction {{in the park}} during its implementation. The local cooperation unit formed a partnership with PT Amal Tani, which has strong relationship with the military command in the area. In January 1998, the Indonesian Forest Ministry granted permission for 11 km road to be built. In June 1998, the local office of the Forestry Service issued a decree stating that the Sapo Padang enclave was no longer legally {{a part of the}} national park, a controversial decision, which consequently led to further forest destruction during the road construction and invited newcomers to slash and burn forest area to create local plantations a way deeper to the park.|$|E

40|$|Clearance {{control is}} of {{paramount}} importance to turbomachinery designers and is required to meet today's aggressive power output, efficiency, and operational life goals. Excessive clearances lead to losses in cycle efficiency, flow instabilities, and hot gas ingestion into disk cavities. Insufficient clearances limit coolant flows and cause interface rubbing, overheating downstream components and damaging interfaces, thus limiting component life. Designers have put renewed attention on clearance control, as it is often the most cost effective method to enhance system performance. Advanced concepts and proper material selection continue to play important roles in maintaining interface clearances to enable the system to meet design goals. This work presents an overview of turbomachinery sealing to control <b>clearances.</b> <b>Areas</b> covered include: characteristics of gas and steam turbine sealing applications and environments, benefits of sealing, types of standard static and dynamics seals, advanced seal designs, as well as life and limitations issues...|$|R

The Act also made State aid available for the first time for building attractive little houses for older people without families.

40|$|A novel {{multiband}} antenna with an unbroken metal rim for wearable applications is presented. In {{order to achieve}} a wideband behavior, minimizing {{at the same time}} the size of the <b>clearance</b> <b>area</b> on the antenna ground plane, a novel feeding structure is proposed. This is achieved by connecting the metal rim to the ground plane thus allowing generating one lower-frequency resonance without occupying a large area. An additional resonance is then obtained using a suitable shorting patch. In this way, the proposed antenna presents a broadband behavior, while the width of the <b>clearance</b> <b>area</b> on the ground plane is of only 2 [*]mm. The antenna performances in free-space and on a human phantom simulating a human body are analyzed by means of numerical simulations. Finally, the specific absorption rate (SAR) is analyzed to establish the antenna reliability in wearable applications. The experimental results demonstrate superior and stable performances of the metal-rimmed antenna when it is employed in wearable applications...|$|E

Data were analysed from published pharmacokinetic studies (after oral and intravenous dosing) in healthy adults and other subgroups using parameters relating primarily to chronic exposure [renal and total <b>clearances,</b> <b>area</b> under the plasma concentration time-curve (AUC) ] and acute exposure (Cmax). Interindividual variability in kinetics was low for both routes of exposure, with coefficients of variation of 21 % (oral) and 24 % (intravenous) that were largely independent of the renal processes involved. Renal-excretion related uncertainty factors were below the default kinetic uncertainty factor of 3. 16 for most subgroups analysed {{with the exception of}} the elderly (oral data) and neonates (intravenous data) for whom renal excretion-related factors of 4. 2 and 3. 2 would be required to cover up to 99 % of these subgroups respectively.

40|$|With the {{continuing}} advancement of nuclear technologies, the detection and identification of radioactive material {{is a necessary}} part of commercial and government applications. There is a wide array of options available for detection and identification of material, but most rely on compact devices which are manually positioned. The deployment of robots equipped with detection equipment is not always feasible, especially in locations where there is considerable debris on the ground, or where there are low <b>clearance</b> <b>areas.</b> To solve this, the goal of this research was to design a remote sensing system for radiation using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A swarm of small-scale quadcopters with detection and navigation capabilities were employed to carry out dynamically tracked radiation measurements. Detection was carried out though the use of a Cs 2 LiYCl 6 :Ce 3 + scintillation detector equipped with pulse shape discrimination (PSD). This allowed for differentiation between neutron and photon radiation signatures based on the shape of the signal. The maximum likelihood estimation technique was employed to search remotely for radiation sources using the data obtained by multiple UAVs...|$|R
