5|$|Djajakusuma often {{included}} traditional arts in his films, {{and two of}} them (Lahirnja Gatotkatja and Bimo Kroda) {{were based}} on traditional wayang stories and used wayang-inspired costumes and tempos.

As a lecturer teaching screenwriting and the history of theatre, Djajakusuma focused on Indonesian arts. He argued that Indonesians should rely on local culture, not continuously look towards the West. In other areas he was mostly apolitical.|$|E

5|$|Roman <b>city</b> <b>life</b> {{and culture}} changed greatly {{in the early}} Middle Ages. Although Italian cities {{remained}} inhabited, they contracted significantly in size.

In Northern Europe, cities also shrank, while civic monuments and other public buildings were raided for building materials. The establishment of new kingdoms often meant some growth for the towns chosen as capitals. Although there had been Jewish communities in many Roman cities, the Jews suffered periods of persecution after the conversion of the empire to Christianity. Officially they were tolerated, if subject to conversion efforts, and at times were even encouraged to settle in new areas.|$|E
