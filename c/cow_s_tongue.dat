40|$|Background: Several {{different}} factors {{point to}} {{the significance of the}} role of non-genetic causes in the etiology of type 1 diabetes. Some studies have suggested a positive correlation between early exposure to <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> milk in infancy and increased later risk of developing the disease, while other studies have not found such a correlation. The issue is still unresolved, and in this systematic review I will investigate the most relevant literature on the subject. Methods: I conducted a systematic literature search in Medline and Embase databases, using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. All studies comparing infant <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> milk exposure with type 1 diabetes risk were included in the review. A total of 19 studies were included, most of them being retrospective case-control designed studies. Results: The included studies were categorized in terms of whether they showed a positive, negative or no correlation between infant <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> milk exposure and risk of type 1 diabetes, and with regard {{to the quality of the}} studies. Six of the studies results were considered to be positive and convincing for increased risk of type 1 diabetes with early infant exposure, four were positive and plausible or positive and lacking, and 12 showed no effect. Conclusions: Divergent results could be seen between the different studies included in this review with regards to whether early infant <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> milk exposure increases the risk of developing type 1 diabetes or not. On the basis of the findings in this review, one can therefore not conclude with a positive, negative or a non-existing relationship between the respective exposure and the disease...|$|R

It is at a later age that some adults do not secrete enough lactase, particularly when they have stopped drinking milk regularly. In such cases, the undigested lactose passes into the large intestine, where it is fermented by bacteria. This intolerance is quite frequent in adults in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America; it is rarer in Europe and North America. People suffering from this ailment can nonetheless consume milk in small amounts, as well as unlimited amounts of butter, cheese and yoghurt as these products contain very little lactose.

40|$|Introduction: Allergy to <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> {{milk protein}} {{is the most}} common food allergy in {{children}} under the age of three years. A diet without milk or dairy products is potentially low in many nutrients and could put the child at risk of malnutrition and compromised growth. Dairy products are a major source of iodine in the Norwegian diet, and excluding dairy products may negatively affect iodine status. Insufficient iodine status during childhood could potentially be detrimental and put the child at risk for delays in mental development and poor growth. Objectives: The main objectives of this study was to investigate iodine intake and status along with growth in infants and young children under two years of age who were on a <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> milk protein free diet and to identify factors affecting iodine status and growth in these children. Methods: Fifty-seven infants and children under two years of age where included in a larger cross-sectional study on the nutritional status of children on <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> milk protein free diets (MILKID study). Two spot urine samples from were collected and analysed for iodine, together with a three day food record and a food frequency questionnaire on dietary sources of iodine. Urine iodine concentrations were compared to the WHO cut-off values for iodine deficiency. Weight, length and head circumference were recorded at birth and at inclusion in the study and compared to the Norwegian growth standard. Sub-group analyses were done on different feeding patterns, according to weaning status. Results: One third of the children had iodine deficiency according to urine iodine concentration (UIC). Children who were mainly breastfed were at highest risk and 58 % was classified as deficient. Dietary factors associated with iodine were intake of enriched baby cereals (r = 0. 230, p = 0. 02) and reaching RDI for iodine through diet (r= 0. 313, p = 0. 03). Children of mothers who took supplement with iodine had higher urinary iodine concentrations, though this was not significant. Growth in length was compromised in boys, 11 % of the infants had weight for age z-score (WAZ) and BMI for age z-score (BMIZ) of ≤ - 2 and 5 % length for age z-scores (LAZ) of ≤ - 2 at inclusion and this was associated with food refusal and low appetite, but not associated with iodine deficiency. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that the exclusion of <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> milk protein puts the child at risk of deficiency of iodine and poor growth, however the two conditions were not related. Infants reliant on breast milk as their main iodine source are at increased risk of iodine deficiency. Boys with feeding problems were at highest risk of growth failure...|$|R

The potential impactof milk lipid structure and composition on neonatal digestive hydrolysis, intestinal physiology, and gutmicrobiota was recently underlined by several scientific teams. In this context, {{the purpose of the}} presentreview was to summarize the specificity of composition and structure of human milk and to highlight therecent results on the modulation of infant formula interfacial composition and fat source on neonataldigestive hydrolysis, intestinal physiology, and gut microbiota. More specifically, the interfacialcomposition of model emulsions stabilized with milk polar lipids will be unraveled as well as the additionof apolar milk fat extracts in replacement to vegetable lipids in infant formulas. The impact of partiallyreplacing vegetable lipids by milk lipids stabilized by milk fat membranes was investigated in the piglets. This replacement in fluenced the neonatal intestinal physiology through the release of immune-modulatory lipids, the modulation of proteolysis, and the modification of gut microbiota. PracticalApplications:The potential development of infant formulas including cow’s milk lipid fractions with a structure closer to human milk is discussed. These more biomimetic formulas should result in enhanced nutritional benefits concerning neonatal digestive hydrolysis, physiology, and gut microbiota developmen...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cow</b> <b>s</b> milk allergy (CMA) affects about 2 - 6 % {{of infants}} and young children. Environmental factors during early life are {{suggested}} {{to play a}} role in the development of allergic diseases. One of these factors is likely to be maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation. The association between maternal diet and development of CMA in offspring is not well known, but diet could contain factors that facilitate development of tolerance. After an established food allergy, another issue is gaining tolerance towards an antigen that causes symptoms. The strictness of the elimination depends on the individual level of tolerance. This study aimed at validating a questionnaire used to inquire about food allergies in children, at researching associations between maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation and subsequent development of <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> milk allergy in the offspring, and at evaluating the degree of adherence to a therapeutic elimination diet of children with CMA and factors associated with the adherence and age of recovery. These research questions were addressed in a prospective birth cohort born between 1997 and 2004 at the Tampere and Oulu University Hospitals. Altogether 6753 children of the Diabetes Prediction and Prevention (DIPP) Nutrition cohort were investigated. Questionnaires regarding allergic diseases are often used in studies without validation. High-quality valid tools are therefore needed. Two validation studies were conducted here: one by comparing parentally reported food allergies with information gathered from patient records of 1122 children, and the other one by comparing parentally reported CMA with information in the reimbursement records of special infant formulae in the registers of the Social Insurance Institution for 6753 children. Both of these studies showed that the questionnaire works well and is a valid tool for measuring food allergies in children. In the first validation study, Cohen s kappa values were within 0. 71 - 0. 88 for CMA, 0. 74 - 0. 82 for cereal allergy, and 0. 66 - 0. 86 for any reported food allergy. In the second validation study, the kappa value was 0. 79, sensitivity 0. 958, and specificity 0. 965 for reported and diagnosed CMA. To investigate the associations between maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation and CMA in offspring, 6288 children were studied. Maternal diet during pregnancy (8 th month) and lactation (3 rd month) was assessed by a validated, 181 -item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and as an endpoint register-based information on diagnosed CMA was obtained from the Social Insurance Institution and complemented with parental reports of CMA in their children. The associations between maternal food consumption and CMA in offspring were analyzed by logistic regression comparing the highest and lowest quarters with two middle quarters of consumption and adjusted for several potential confounding factors. High maternal intake of milk products (OR 0. 56, 95 % CI 0. 37 - 0. 86 p = 0. 002) was associated with a lower risk of CMA in offspring. When stratified according to maternal allergic rhinitis or asthma, a protective association of high use of milk products with CMA was seen in children of allergy-free mothers (OR 0. 30, 95 % CI 0. 13 - 0. 69, p < 0. 001), but not in children of allergic mothers. Moreover, low maternal consumption of fish during pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of CMA in children of mothers with allergic rhinitis or asthma (OR 1. 47, 95 % CI 0. 96 - 2. 27 for the lowest quarter, p = 0. 043). In children of nonallergic mothers, this association was not seen. Maternal diet during lactation was not associated with CMA in offspring, apart from an inverse association between citrus and kiwi fruit consumption and CMA. These results imply that maternal diet during pregnancy may contain factors protective against CMA in offspring, more so than maternal diet during lactation. These results need to be confirmed in other studies before giving recommendations to the public. To evaluate the degree of adherence to a therapeutic elimination diet in children with diagnosed CMA, food records of 267 children were studied. Subsequent food records were examined to assess the age at reintroduction of milk products to the child s diet. Nine of ten families adhered to the elimination diet of the child with extreme accuracy. Older and monosensitized children had more often small amounts of <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> milk protein in their diet (p < 0. 001 for both). Adherence to the diet was not related to any other sociodemographic factor studied or to the age at reintroduction of milk products to the diet. Low intakes of vitamin D, calcium, and riboflavin are of concern in children following a <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> milk-free diet. In summary, we found that the questionnaires used in the DIPP study are valid in investigating CMA in young children; that there are associations between maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation and the development of CMA in offspring; and that the therapeutic elimination diet in children with diagnosed CMA is rigorously adhered to. Maitoallergia koskettaa n. 2 - 6 % lapsista. Varhaisilla ympäristötekijöillä voi olla vaikutuksia allergisten sairauksien kehittymiseen. Tässä tutkimuksessa selvitettiin kyselykaavakkeen luotettavuutta ruoka-allergioiden tutkimisessa, äidin raskauden ja imetyksen aikaisen ruokavalion yhteyttä lapsen maitoallergian riskiin sekä maitoallergisten lasten välttämisruokavalion noudattamistarkkuutta ja sen yhteyttä taustatekijöihin ja ruokavalion päättymisikään. Näitä tutkimuskysymyksiä selvitettiin vuosien 1997 ja 2004 välisenä aikana Tampereen ja Oulun yliopistollisissa sairaaloissa tehdyssä tutkimuksessa (Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention (DIPP) Ravintotutkimus). Kyselykaavakkeiden luotettavuutta selvitettiin vertaamalla vanhempien ilmoittamia ruoka-allergioita sairaalan potilaskertomustietoihin sekä KELA:n rekisteritietoon imeväisten erityisvalmisteiden erityiskorvattavuuspäätöksistä. Kyselykaavakkeiden luotettavuus todettiin hyväksi: vanhemmat raportoivat lastensa ruoka-allergiat yhdenmukaisesti lääkärin tekemän diagnoosin kanssa. Äidin raskauden- ja imetyksen aikaisen ruokavalion ja lapsen maitoallergian riskin välisten yhteyksien selvittämiseksi äitien ruokavaliota kartoitettiin ruoankäytön frekvenssikyselyllä kahdeksannella raskauskuulla sekä imetyksen aikana lapsen ollessa kolmen kuukauden ikäinen. Tieto lapsen maitoallergiasta perustui KELA:n rekisteritietoihin sekä vanhempien raportoimaan. Äidin runsas maitovalmisteiden käyttö oli yhteydessä matalaan maitoallergian riskiin. Tutkittaessa allergisia ja ei-allergisia äitejä ja heidän lapsiaan erikseen, suojaava yhteys näkyi ainoastaan ei-allergisten äitien ja heidän lastensa kohdalla. Toisaalta allergisten äitien vähäinen kalan käyttö oli yhteydessä suurempaan maitoallergian riskiin. Äidin imetyksen aikainen ruokavalio ei ollut yhteydessä lapsen maitoallergian riskiin. Maitoallergisten lasten ruokapäiväkirjoja tutkittiin välttämisruokavalion noudattamistarkkuuden ja päättymisen selvittämiseksi. Yhdeksän kymmenestä perheestä noudatti ruokavaliota hyvin tarkasti. Pieniä määriä maitoproteiinia oli useammin yksinomaan maidolle allergisten ja vanhempien lasten ruokavaliossa. Ruokavalion noudattamistarkkuus ja maitotuotteiden palautus ruokavalioon ei riippunut muista taustatekijöistä, kuten vanhempien iästä tai koulutustasosta. Maitoallergisten lasten D-vitamiinin, kalsiumin ja B 2 vitamiinin (riboflaviini) saanti ei aina ole riittävää välttämisruokavalion aikana, eikä sen jälkeen. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että DIPP-ravintotutkimuksessa ruoka-allergian tutkimiseen käytettävät lomakkeet toimivat luotettavasti; että äidin raskauden aikaisella ruokavaliolla on yhteys lapsen maitoallergian kehittymiseen; ja että suomalaisperheissä maitoallergisten lasten välttämisruokavalio toteutuu tarkasti...|$|R

40|$|The exotic plant {{known as}} hound’s tongue (Cynoglossum officinale) invades rangelands in British Columbia (BC) and creates {{economic}} welfare losses to ranchers {{and the broader}} society through declining rangeland productivity, recreation opportunities, and soil fertility. In addition to such adverse effects, hound 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>tongue</b> also disperses "burrs" that infest cattle and reduce their market value. I assume that a representative rancher attempts to maximize the profits from livestock sales subject {{to the growth of}} hound’s tongue in nearby rangelands. I develop a bio-economic model to demonstrate this management problem and derive the optimal allocation of labour for pulling hound’s tongue and the area of infested land at the steady state. My research findings show that the private steady state equilibrium is not considerably different from the social steady state equilibrium. Furthermore, a private rancher may be willing to control hound’s tongue in the neighbouring rangelands, once the marginal benefits from controlling hound’s tongue {{in his or her own}} rangeland becomes less than the marginal benefits of controlling hound’s tongue in the neighbouring public rangeland. Under such circumstances, government intervention to control hound’s tongue may yield few incremental social benefits. The findings of this study may have implications for the design of invasive plant management strategies. Instead of direct government intervention, offering incentives to private ranchers may be appropriate for controlling invaders such as hound’s tongue in rangelands in BC or elsewhere. If the intent of invasive plant management strategy is to provide support to ranchers more generally, then this may be better achieved via other means...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out at the Mahwa station located in Bututsi natural region in South of Burundi at 1850 m of altitude. The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to assess the effects of days in milk, cow's calving age, type of crossbreeding, year and month of lactation, parity on daily milk yield of crossbreds Ayrshire (AY) x Sahiwal (S) x Ankole (A) cows. Milk yields were obtained from 9 <b>cows</b> (<b>S)</b> that have been both milked and suckled during the entire lactation, on 8 cows (M) only milked during the entire lactation and on 150 cows (SM) suckled before and milked after weaning. Data were analyzed using the procedure GLM in SAS for S,M, and SM cows separately. All factors affected significantly daily milk yields (P < 0. 001). Least-squares means (LSM) for daily milk yields were highest at the 8 th (7. 16 +/- 0. 07 1), 8 th (7. 63 +/- 0. 35 1), and 7 th (7. 34 +/- 0. 39 1) day in milk for SM, S and M lactations, respectively. The Wood model was able to detect 2 main groups of curve shape: standard for SM and <b>S</b> <b>cows</b> and atypical decreasing for M cows. An important decrease in milk production was observed around the 120 th day in SM cows corresponding to the weaning period. Crossbreeding improved milk production and highest yields were observed with 50 % to 75 % of Ayrshire inheritance (LSM = 5 +/- 0. 05 to 5. 51 +/- 0. 02 1 /day). A significant increase was observed from 1977 to 1992 due to the improvement of genetic and management techniques. During this period, LSM raised from 1. 26 +/- 0. 11 1 to 4. 74 +/- 0. 03 1 per day for SM cows. Unfortunately, the 1993 civilian war destabilized the managerial techniques and consequently, the milk production decreased in Mahwa station, In all cows, milk production was significantly higher from December to May (LSM - 3. 96 +/- 0. 03 1 /day) during the rainy season than in September (LSM = 3. 12 +/- 0. 03 1 /day) at the end of the dry season.
