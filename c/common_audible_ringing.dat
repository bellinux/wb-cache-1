50|$|<b>Audible</b> <b>ringing</b> (ringing tone, colloquially also {{ringback}} tone) is a {{signaling tone}} in telecommunication that is {{heard by the}} originator of a telephone call while the destination terminal is alerting the receiving party. <b>Audible</b> <b>ringing</b> is typically a repeated tone that is not synchronous with the cadence of the power ringing signal that {{is sent to the}} called party.|$|R
50|$|A {{telephone}} rings {{when the}} telephone network indicates an incoming call, {{so that the}} recipient is alerted of the calling attempt. For landline telephones typically receive an electrical alternating current signal, called power ringing, generated by the telephone exchange to which the telephone is connected.The ringing current originally operated an electric bell. For mobile phones, the network {{sends a message to}} the device, indicating the incoming call. The caller is informed about the progress of the call by the <b>audible</b> <b>ringing</b> signal, often called ringback tone. Power <b>ringing</b> and <b>audible</b> <b>ringing</b> are not synchronized.|$|R
50|$|In Japan, the {{standard}} <b>audible</b> <b>ringing</b> tone is a repeating 1-second tone with a 2-second pause between. The tone has a frequency of 400 Â± 20 Hz, and the amplitude modulation is 15 to 20Hz.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} caller tunes in some countries, such as India, {{ringback}} {{music is a}} service offered by mobile network operators to permit subscribers to select music or even install personalized recorded sounds for <b>audible</b> <b>ringing.</b>|$|R
50|$|In North America (excluding Mexico, Central America {{and parts}} of the Caribbean), the {{standard}} <b>audible</b> <b>ringing</b> tone is a repeating 2-second tone with a 4-second pause between. The signal is composed of the frequencies 440 Hz and 480 Hz.|$|R
50|$|Ringing is a {{telecommunication}} {{signal that}} causes a bell or other device to alert a telephone subscriber to an incoming telephone call. Historically, this entailed sending a high-voltage alternating current {{over the telephone}} line to a customer station which contained an electromagnetic bell. It is therefore also {{commonly referred to as}} power ringing, to distinguish it from another signal, <b>audible</b> <b>ringing,</b> which is sent to the originating caller to indicate that the destination telephone is in fact ringing.|$|R
60|$|Doctor Wallace's {{voice was}} low and grave; it quavered {{here and there in}} passages. Lane's was hardly <b>audible.</b> Mel's <b>rang</b> deep and full.|$|R
50|$|<b>Audible</b> <b>ringing</b> {{is usually}} {{generated}} in the switching system closest to the calling party, especially when {{under the control of}} strict implementations of Signalling System No. 7 and the Customized Application of Mobile Enhanced Logic (CAMEL) signaling system. It may also be {{generated in the}} distant switch, transmitted in-band, so that in analog networks the caller could monitor the quality of the voice path of the connection before the call is established. Remote call progress indication permits customized tones or voice announcements by a distant switch in place of the ringing tone.|$|R
5000|$|As per NFPA 72, 18.4.2 (2010 Edition)Temporal Code 3 is the {{standard}} audible notification in a modern system. It consists of a repeated 3-pulse cycle (.5s on [...]5s off [...]5s on [...]5s off [...]5s on 1.5s off). Voice Evacuation {{is the second most}} <b>common</b> <b>audible</b> in a modern system. Legacy systems, typically found in older schools and building have used continuous tones alongside other audible schema.|$|R
50|$|Another method, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} <b>common</b> <b>audible,</b> utilizes the internal circuitry of the KSU power supply, and circuitry {{in the individual}} key telephone units serving each line, to provide a separate and locally generated ringing signal for each phone line. This has the advantage that the ringing signal for any given line may be routed to any phone, or combinations of phones, but it also had the disadvantage of being non-functional during a local power outage.|$|R
25|$|The {{diaphragm}} {{is usually}} manufactured with a cone- or dome-shaped profile. A {{variety of different}} materials may be used, but the most common are paper, plastic, and metal. The ideal material would 1) be rigid, to prevent uncontrolled cone motions; 2) have low mass, to minimize starting force requirements and energy storage issues; 3) be well damped, to reduce vibrations continuing after the signal has stopped {{with little or no}} <b>audible</b> <b>ringing</b> due to its resonance frequency as determined by its usage. In practice, all three of these criteria cannot be met simultaneously using existing materials; thus, driver design involves trade-offs. For example, paper is light and typically well damped, but is not stiff; metal may be stiff and light, but it usually has poor damping; plastic can be light, but typically, the stiffer it is made, the poorer the damping. As a result, many cones are made of some sort of composite material. For example, a cone might be made of cellulose paper, into which some carbon fiber, Kevlar, glass, hemp or bamboo fibers have been added; or it might use a honeycomb sandwich construction; or a coating might be applied to it so as to provide additional stiffening or damping.|$|R
5000|$|Taylor now commentates on {{the three}} {{televised}} snooker tournaments each year for the BBC and {{is known for his}} bona fide and light-hearted commentary. His most famous commentary incident occurred in 1998 when co-commentator Clive Everton nearly strangled Taylor after instinctively grabbing his tie as he fell off his chair. Everton wrongly believed one snooker was required by a player before Taylor stated correctly that he actually needed three snookers {{to get back into the}} frame. Everton subsequently proclaimed that his [...] "brains have gone completely" [...] before leaning back in his chair which then gave way. He reached out as he fell, grabbing Taylor's tie and pulling him down with him. An <b>audible</b> bang <b>rang</b> around the auditorium as Everton fell off his chair and out the commentary box with Taylor chuckling uncontrollably.|$|R
5000|$|In music, metric {{modulation}} is {{a change}} in pulse rate (tempo) and/or pulse grouping (subdivision) which is derived from a note value or grouping heard before the change. Examples of metric modulation may include changes in time signature across an unchanging tempo, but the concept applies more specifically to shifts from one time signature/tempo (metre) to another, wherein a note value from the first is made equivalent to a note value in the second, like a pivot or bridge. The term [...] "modulation" [...] invokes the analogous and more familiar term in analyses of tonal harmony, wherein a pitch or pitch interval serves as a bridge between two keys. In both terms, the pivoting value functions differently before and after the change, but sounds the same, and acts as an <b>audible</b> <b>common</b> element between them. Metric modulation was first described by Richard Franko [...] while reviewing the Cello Sonata of Elliott Carter, who prefers to call it tempo modulation [...] Another synonymous term is proportional tempi [...]|$|R
6000|$|Again, in Courts of Law, {{with their}} money-quarrels, divorce-cases, wheresoever {{a glimpse into}} the {{household}} existence can be had, what indications! The Parlements of Besancon and Aix <b>ring,</b> <b>audible</b> to all France, with the amours and destinies of a young Mirabeau. He, under the nurture of a 'Friend of Men,' has, in State Prisons, in marching Regiments, Dutch Authors' garrets, and quite other scenes, 'been for twenty years learning to resist 'despotism:' despotism of men, and alas also of gods. How, beneath this rose-coloured veil of Universal Benevolence and Astraea Redux, is the sanctuary of Home so often a dreary void, or a dark contentious Hell-on-Earth! The old Friend of Men has his own divorce case too; and at times, 'his whole family but one' under lock and key: he writes much about reforming and enfranchising the world; and for his own private behoof he has needed sixty Lettres-de-Cachet. A man of insight too, with resolution, even with manful principle: but in such an element, inward and outward; which he could not rule, but only madden. Edacity, rapacity;--quite contrary to the finer sensibilities of the heart! Fools, that expect your verdant Millennium, and nothing but Love and Abundance, brooks running wine, winds whispering music,--with the whole ground and basis of your existence champed into a mud of Sensuality; which, daily growing deeper, will soon have no bottom but the Abyss! ...|$|R
