Currently, the germ plasm evaluation project at the Meat Animal Research Center (MARC) provides such a common environment for reference bulls of several breeds for estimation of breed differences for the reference sires. Reference sire estimates of breed differences are adjusted by the difference between average EPD of reference bulls and average EPD for the base year for that breed. Two related questions are as follows: 1) What are <b>confidence</b> <b>ranges</b> for the adjustments and 2) What are accuracies of interbreed EPD? Application of statistical principles and algebra shows that 1) apparent <b>confidence</b> <b>ranges</b> for breed adjustments are small, 2) apparent <b>confidence</b> <b>ranges</b> are substantially underestimated when random sire effects within breed are ignored, 3) correct <b>confidence</b> <b>ranges</b> also are small, 4) usual measures of accuracy {{cannot be applied to}} interbreed comparisons, and 5) standard errors of prediction used in calculating <b>confidence</b> <b>ranges</b> for interbreed comparisons are much less affected by variance of the adjustment factors than by within-breed accuracies for two bulls being compared except for bulls with accuracies of near unity.

50|$|The {{alternative}} {{is to take the}} original normal distribution of radiocarbon age ranges and use it to generate a histogram showing the relative probabilities for calendar ages. This has to be done by numerical methods rather than by a formula because the calibration curve is not describable as a formula. Programs to perform these calculations include OxCal and CALIB. These can be accessed online; they allow the user to enter a date range at one standard deviation confidence for the radiocarbon ages, select a calibration curve, and produce probabilistic output both as tabular data and in graphical form.In the example CALIB output shown at left, the input data is 1270 BP, {{with a standard deviation of}} 10 radiocarbon years. The curve selected is the northern hemisphere INTCAL13 curve, part of which is shown in the output; the vertical width of the curve corresponds to the width of the standard error in the calibration curve at that point. A normal distribution is shown at left; this is the input data, in radiocarbon years. The central darker part of the normal curve is the range within one standard deviation of the mean; the lighter grey area shows the range within two standard deviations of the mean. The output is along the bottom axis; it is a trimodal graph, with peaks at around 710 AD, 740 AD, and 760 AD. Again, the ranges within the 1σ <b>confidence</b> <b>range</b> are in dark grey, and the ranges within the 2σ <b>confidence</b> <b>range</b> are in light grey.

Certain projects like GCIP allow have focused on continental scale observations provide better prediction for project areas; however, areas outside these project areas may lag in receiving forecasting improvements. Many of the deficiencies in Phase I are improvement areas within the objectives of Phase II of the project.

A total of 257 ESs were in the moderate range for STM measures (M = –. 61, 95 % <b>confidence</b> <b>range</b> of –. 65 to –. 58), and 320 ESs were in the moder-ate range for WM measures (M = –. 67, 95 % <b>confidence</b> <b>range</b> of –. 68 to –. 64). The results indicated that children with RD were distinctively disadvantaged compared with average readers on (a) STM measures requiring the recall of phonemes and digit sequences and (b) WM measures requiring the simultaneous processing and storage of digits within sentence sequences and final words from unrelated sentences. No significant moderating effects emerged for age, IQ, or reading level on memory ESs.

In this study, we used a process-based ecosystem model driven by multiple environmental factors to examine the net warming potential resulting from net exchanges of CO(2), CH(4), and N(2) O between China's terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere during 1961 - 2005. In the past 45 years, China's terrestrial ecosystems were found to sequestrate CO(2) {{at a rate of}} 179. 3 Tg C yr(- 1) with a 95 % <b>confidence</b> <b>range</b> of (62. 0 Tg C yr(- 1), 264. 9 Tg C yr(- 1)) while emitting CH(4) and N(2) O at rates of 8. 3 Tg C yr(- 1) with a 95 % <b>confidence</b> <b>range</b> of (3. 3 Tg C yr(- 1), 12. 4 Tg C yr(- 1)) and 0. 6 Tg N yr(- 1) with a 95 % <b>confidence</b> <b>range</b> of (0. 2 Tg N yr(- 1), 1. 1 Tg N yr(- 1)), respectively. When translated into global warming potential, it is highly possible that China's terrestrial ecosystems mitigated global climate warming at a rate of 96. 9 Tg CO(2) eq yr(- 1) (1 Tg = 10 (12) g), substantially varying from a source of 766. 8 Tg CO(2) eq yr(- 1) in 1997 to a sink of 705. 2 Tg CO(2) eq yr(- 1) in 2002. The southeast and northeast of China slightly contributed to global climate warming; while the northwest, north, and southwest of China imposed cooling effects on the climate system. Paddy land, followed by natural wetland and dry cropland, was the largest contributor to national warming potential; forest, followed by woodland and grassland, played the most significant role in alleviating climate warming. Our simulated results indicate that CH(4) and N(2) O emissions offset approximately 84. 8 % of terrestrial CO(2) sink in China during 1961 - 2005. This study suggests that the relieving effects of China's terrestrial ecosystems on climate warming through sequestering CO(2) might be gradually offset by increasing N(2) O emission, in combination with CH(4) emission...|$|E

Imperative constructs written in other languages (MATLAB, FORTRAN, C++, etc.) are accessed through procedure calls. MML syntax is simple, basically defining the parameters and variables, then writing the equations in a straightforward, easily read and understood mathematical form. This makes JSim good for teaching modeling as well as for model analysis for research.    For high throughput applications, JSim can be run as a batch job.   JSim can automatically translate models from the repositories for Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and CellML models. Stochastic modeling is supported. MML supports assigning physical units to constants and variables and automates checking dimensional balance as the first step in verification testing. Automatic unit scaling follows, e. g. seconds to minutes, if needed.
