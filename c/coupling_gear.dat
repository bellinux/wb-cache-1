For example, planetary gear trains can be designed for following functions: gear reducers for power machinery, internal gear hubs for bicycle, gear increasers for wind generator, gear reducers for robot. In general, the reduction of non-coupled planetary gear train is less than 10. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to introduce the planetary gear train with high reduction ratio. <b>Coupled</b> planetary <b>gear</b> train can be designed to has high reduction ratio.

40|$|To {{study the}} fluid motion-vehicle {{dynamics}} interaction, {{a model of}} four, liquid filled two-axle container freight wagons was set up. The railway vehicle has been modelled as a multi-body system (MBS). To include fluid sloshing, an equivalent mechanical model has been developed and incorporated. The influence of several factors has been studied in computer simulations, such as track defects, curve negotiation, train velocity, wheel wear, liquid and solid wagonload, and container baffles. SIMPACK {{has been used for}} MBS analysis, and ANSYS for liquid sloshing modelling and equivalent mechanical systems validation. Acceleration and braking manoeuvres of the freight train set the liquid cargo into motion.

Simulation results showed that, for certain combinations of type of liquid, filling level and container dimensions, the liquid cargo could provoke an undesirable, although not hazardous, release of the unused coupling screw from its hanger. The coupling screw's release was especially obtained when a period of acceleration was followed by an abrupt braking manoeuvre at 1 m/s 2. It was shown that a resonance effect between the liquid's oscillation and the coupling screw's rotary motion could be the reason for the coupling screw's undesired release.

40|$|LecturePg. 101 - 110 The {{design and}} {{application}} of solid couplings combined with flexible quill shafts for high speed turbocompressors are presented. Solid couplings are rigid in the axial direction. They transmit any residual thrust from one compressor casing to another, and even into the gear. A single thrust bearing then positions the complete rotor train. Elimination of individual thrust bearings results in a smaller lube-oil system and a reduced power loss. Any additional thrust components from a prestressed flexible-disc coupling or a gear-type <b>coupling</b> (<b>gear</b> lock) are completely avoided. The use of a flexible intermediate shaft (quill shaft) gives the solid coupling the same lateral flexibility as for a geartype or flexible-disc coupling. Criteria for allowable misalignment are given in this paper. A solid coupling is neither exposed {{to any kind of}} wear nor endangered by corrosion or stress corrosion so that no maintenance is necessary. Couplings have a decisive influence on rotordynamics. The conventional arrangement of a multicasing train with gear-type or flexible-disc couplings incorporates individual thrust bearings located outboard of the journal bearings (long shaft over hangs). Introducing solid couplings leads to a stiffer rotor by eliminating individual thrust bearings. A comparison of critical speeds of a high-speed/high-power compressor train is made alternatively equipped with solid couplings, flexible-disc or gear-type couplings. The response of the different rotors and couplings to specified unbalance weights is calculated and compared throughout the complete speed range. Torsional and lateral critical frequencies can easily be influenced by modification of intermediate shafts, even after installation of a compressor train. Operating experience on nearly 1500 compressors equipped with solid couplings have proven their excellent reliability especially on high speed, high power turbocompressor applications...|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 79 - 92 A rotordynamics {{analysis}} of an 8000 hp steam turbine which drives an ethylene compressor is presented. This machine characteristically exhibited increasing vibration levels with increasing speed, {{in the upper}} portion of the speed range. It was suspected that this ramping vibration was due to operation near a critical speed. The purpose of this analysis was to identify {{the source of this}} high vibration with the present rotor and hearings and then to determine the best solution to the problem. The computer analysis determined that the original rotor/bearing system was operating near the second critical speed. The predicted peaks were within nine percent to thirteen percent of miming speed (8400 cpm). The optimum solution was to shorten the shaft at the governor end and replace the bearings. The shaft modification consisted of cutting off the governor worm gear assembly and replacing it with an electronic governor disk. This new bearing design was also a four-shoe tilting pad journal bearing, but it had longer pads and higher preload than the existing design. Because there was concern about <b>coupling</b> <b>gear</b> tooth lock-up in the original design, a dry, flexible-element coupling design was evaluated. The coupling change was also of interest because of its potential effect on moving the second critical speed. However, in this ease, the analysis determined that the rotor vibration characteristics were very close with either the existing gear coupling or the dry coupling. Therefore, the justification fo r changing couplings would be that the dry coupling would not be susceptible to drive tooth lockup and unbalance eccentricity due to tooth wear...|$|E

In particular, the performances of two functions, the transmission and {{the conversion of the}} energy, are compared between the hard and soft gears systems.

Second, we show the responses of this system in which one of gears have contact with a high temperature heat bath and the other gears have contact with a 0 temperature heat bath. With the coupling T), the directional rotations appear in two gears having contact with 0 temperature heat bath. Here, the direction of these rotations change depending on the noise strength...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{micromachining}} generally {{offers more}} design freedom than related technologies, {{and it is}} the technology of choice for most microelectromechanical applications that require multi-level structures. However, the design flexibility that surface micromachining offers is not without limitations. In addition to determining how to fabricate devices in a planar world, the designer also needs to consider issues such as film quality, thickness, residual stress, topography propagation, stringers, processing limitations, and concerns about surface adhesion [1]. Only a few years ago, these were the types of issues that limited design complexity. As the technology improved, the number of mechanical layers available to the designer became the dominant constraint on system functionality. In response, we developed a 5 -level polysilicon fabrication technology [2] that offers an unprecedented level of microelectromechanical complexity with simultaneous increases in system yield and robustness. This paper outlines the application that was the driving force behind this work and describes the first devices specifically designed for and fabricated in this technology. The 5 -level fabrication technology developed to support this program is known as SUMMiT-V. Four mechanical layers of polysilicon referred to as polyl, poly 2, poly 3, and poly 4 are fabricated above a polyO electrical interconnect and ground plane layer [2, 4]. PolyO is 0. 3 pm thick, polyl is 1. 0 pm, poly 2 is 1. 5 pm, and both poly 3 and poly 4 are 2. 25 pm. All films except polyl and poly 2 are separated by 2 -pm thick depositions of sacrificial oxide. A 0. 5 -m sacrificial oxide between polyl and poly 2 typically defines the clearance between close mating parts such as hubs and hinges. This entire stack is built on a single crystal substrate with a dielectric foundation of 0. 8 pm of nitride over 0. 63 m of oxide. Seventeen drawing layer are combined to generate the 14 photolithographic masks used to pattern these films during a 240 -step fabrication sequence. Mirror Operation To become operational, both mirrors must be driven up to a 45 degree angle. In this position, optical energy entering through an opening in the substrate beneath one mirror [5] is redirected to the second mirror, then down through another substrate opening and onto the target receiver. Each mirror is actuated through a chain of gears driven by a mirror control engine. This chain incorporates a series of gear reduction units that significantly increase drive torque and positional resolution. Also included in this chain are two gears that are not coupled to each other (see figure 3). This prevents the mirror control engine from driving the rack that actuates the mirror. To complete the drive train, two additional gears must be inserted between the interrupted gear pair [4]. The <b>coupling</b> <b>gears</b> that perform this function are shown in figure 4. Both of these gears are fabricated on a plate that moves towards the interrupted pair of gears as the discrimination sequence The plate onto which the <b>coupling</b> <b>gears</b> are fabricated is attached to the left end of the maze rack, so it moves as the rack moves. If the wrong path is taken at any of the 24 decision points in the maze, the <b>coupling</b> <b>gears</b> will not move far enough to complete the mirror gear chain, and the mirror can never be operated. Thus, this is a single attempt device with more than 16 million possible code sequences...|$|R

40|$|<b>Coupling</b> worm <b>gears</b> {{in large}} machine tool {{manipulator}} units (axes) {{can lead to}} overload damages under some operating conditions, like asymmetrical driving and emergency stop. This behaviour {{is caused by the}} self locking characteristic of worm gears with small pitch. If operated in the direction opposite to the designated one, self-locking can occur in the gears, subjecting the gears to an arbitrary torque which can be destructive. This condition can occur without counter torque on the driving side. In most gears, tooth engagement is based on a rolling motion. The slip component increases with a growing axis angle between the paired gears. In case of worm gears, the axis angle is 90 _, and therefore the coupling is purely frictious. This friction coupling is important in modelling. Especially the transition between the static and dynamic friction, where the system parameters change abruptly by a factor of two, should not be neglected. Based on the evaluated model a synchronous controller has been developed.
