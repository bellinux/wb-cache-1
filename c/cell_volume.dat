5|$|In {{mammalian}} cells, {{the average}} {{diameter of the}} nucleus is approximately 6 micrometres (µm), which occupies about 10% of the total <b>cell</b> <b>volume.</b> The viscous liquid within it is called nucleoplasm (or karyolymph), and is similar in composition to the cytosol found outside the nucleus. It appears as a dense, roughly spherical or irregular organelle. The composition by dry weight of the nucleus is approximately: DNA 9%, RNA 1%, Histone Protein 11%, Residual Protein 14%, Acidic Proteins 65%.|$|E
5|$|In plant cells, vacuoles cover {{anywhere}} from 30% to 90% {{of the total}} <b>cell</b> <b>volume.</b> Most mature plant cells contain one large central vacuole encompassed by a membrane called the tonoplast. Vacuoles of plant cells act as storage compartments for the nutrients and waste of a cell. The solution that these molecules are stored in is called the cell sap. Pigments that color the cell are sometime located in the cell sap. Vacuoles can also {{increase the size of}} the cell, which elongates as water is added, and they control the turgor pressure (the osmotic pressure that keeps the cell wall from caving in). Like lysosomes of animal cells, vacuoles have an acidic pH and contain hydrolytic enzymes. The pH of vacuoles enables them to perform homeostatic procedures in the cell. For example, when the pH in the cells environment drops, the H+ ions surging into the cytosol can be transferred to a vacuole {{in order to keep the}} cytosol's pH constant.|$|E
50|$|Osmosis is {{the process}} in which water flows from an area with a low solute concentration, to an {{adjacent}} area with a higher solute concentration until equilibrium between the two areas is reached. All cells are surrounded by a lipid bi-layer cell membrane which permits {{the flow of water}} {{in and out of the}} cell while also limiting the flow of solutes. In hypertonic solutions, water flows out of the cell which decreases the <b>cell's</b> <b>volume.</b> When in a hypotonic solution, water flows into the membrane and increases the <b>cell's</b> <b>volume.</b> When in an isotonic solution, water flows in and out of the cell at an equal rate.|$|R

5|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) is a membranous synthesis and transport organelle {{that is an}} extension of the nuclear envelope. More than half the total membrane in eukaryotic cells is accounted for by the ER. The ER is made up of flattened sacs and branching tubules that are thought to interconnect, so that the ER membrane forms a continuous sheet enclosing a single internal space. This highly convoluted space is called the ER lumen and is also referred to as the ER cisternal space. The lumen takes up about ten percent of the entire <b>cell</b> <b>volume.</b> The {{endoplasmic reticulum}} membrane allows molecules to be selectively transferred between the lumen and the cytoplasm, and since it is connected to the nuclear envelope, it provides a channel between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.|$|E
5|$|The {{proportion}} of <b>cell</b> <b>volume</b> that is cytosol varies: for example while this compartment forms {{the bulk of}} cell structure in bacteria, in plant cells the main compartment is the large central vacuole. The cytosol consists mostly of water, dissolved ions, small molecules, and large water-soluble molecules (such as proteins). The majority of these non-protein molecules have a molecular mass of less than 300Da. This mixture of small molecules is extraordinarily complex, as the variety of molecules {{that are involved in}} metabolism (the metabolites) is immense. For example, up to 200,000 different small molecules might be made in plants, although not all these will be present in the same species, or in a single cell. Estimates of the number of metabolites in single cells such as E. coli and baker's yeast predict that under 1,000 are made.|$|E
5|$|Both asexual {{and sexual}} spores or sporangiospores are often {{actively}} dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures {{as well as}} traveling through the air over long distances. Specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms, as well as spore surface structures (such as hydrophobins), enable efficient spore ejection. For example, {{the structure of the}} spore-bearing cells in some ascomycete species is such that the buildup of substances affecting <b>cell</b> <b>volume</b> and fluid balance enables the explosive discharge of spores into the air. The forcible discharge of single spores termed ballistospores involves formation of a small drop of water (Buller's drop), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000g; the net result is that the spore is ejected 0.01–0.02cm, sufficient distance for it to fall through the gills or pores into the air below. Other fungi, like the puffballs, rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces. The bird's nest fungi use the force of falling water drops to liberate the spores from cup-shaped fruiting bodies. Another strategy is seen in the stinkhorns, a group of fungi with lively colors and putrid odor that attract insects to disperse their spores.|$|E

40|$|Three end-member clinopyroxenes {{from the}} NaM 13 +Si 2 O 6 series (M 1 = Al, Fe and Ga) have been {{examined}} by single-crystal X-ray diffraction at pressures up to 11 GPa. NaGaSi 2 O 6 was also examined with Raman spectroscopy to 16. 5 GPa. NaAlSi 2 O 6 (jadeite) and NaFeSi 2 O 6 (aegirine) are naturally occurring minerals. NaGaSi 2 O 6 is synthetic. Various characteristics {{of each of the}} three clinopyroxenes as a function of pressure are reported, including bulk moduli (K 0), unit <b>cell</b> <b>volumes,</b> atomic positions, and bond lengths. The compressibilities of a selection of clino- and orthopyroxenes from the literature were examined and considered in terms of M 2 -O 3 bonding and unit <b>cell</b> <b>volumes.</b> As predicted by previous workers, pyroxene compressibilities generally correlate with unit <b>cell</b> <b>volumes</b> at ambient conditions. Compressibilities are also found, however, to be significantly affected by the relationship of M 2 -O 3 bonds with the sense of rotation of silica tetrahedra upon compression. Two such relationships are observed: sympathetic, where the corner of the SiO 4 tetrahedron tilts toward M 2, and antipathetic, where the corner of the tetrahedron tilts away from M 2. All interatomic separations in pyroxenes decrease with pressure, but sympathetic-type separations decrease more than expected based on isotropic scaling of the unit cell. Pyroxene structures may have one of several M 2 -O 3 bond configurations: none, one, two or four bonds, and none, only sympathetic, only antipathetic, or a mixture of both types of bonds. Structures with antipathetic bonds are significantly stiffer than structures without, all else constant. The sympathetic/antipathetic bond hypothesis represents a new, previously unrecognized, first-order control on pyroxene compressibility. M 1 size controls ambient unit <b>cell</b> <b>volumes</b> of clinopyroxenes. However, M 1 size does not correlate well with pyroxene bulk moduli. Applying the idea of sympathetic and antipathetic M 2 -O 3 bonding, much of the dispersion in a plot of M 1 cation size versus bulk modulus can be explained. The three NaM 13 +Si 2 O 6 clinopyroxenes examined in this study exhibit very similar behavior under compression. All show signs of approaching a C 2 /c -> C 2 /c phase transition at ~ 20 GPa. All exhibit unit strain ellipsoids with similar orientations and dimensions. All have identical bond topologies and bulk moduli that correlate with their ambient unit <b>cell</b> <b>volumes...</b>|$|R
5|$|Mitochondria (and related structures) {{are found}} in all eukaryotes (except one—the Oxymonad Monocercomonoides sp.). Although {{commonly}} depicted as bean-like structures they form a highly dynamic network {{in the majority of}} cells where they constantly undergo fission and fusion. Mitochondria vary in number and location according to cell type. A single mitochondrion is often found in unicellular organisms. Conversely, numerous mitochondria {{are found in}} human liver cells, with about 1000–2000 mitochondria per cell, making up 1/5 of the <b>cell</b> <b>volume.</b> The population of all the mitochondria of a given cell constitutes the chondriome. The mitochondrial content of otherwise similar cells can vary substantially in size and membrane potential, with differences arising from sources including uneven partitioning at cell divisions, leading to extrinsic differences in ATP levels and downstream cellular processes. The mitochondria can be found nestled between myofibrils of muscle or wrapped around the sperm flagellum. Often, they form a complex 3D branching network inside the cell with the cytoskeleton. The association with the cytoskeleton determines mitochondrial shape, which can affect the function as well: different structures of the mitochondrial network may afford the population a variety of physical, chemical, and signalling advantages or disadvantages. Mitochondria in cells are always distributed along microtubules and the distribution of these organelles is also correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Recent evidence suggests that vimentin, one of the components of the cytoskeleton, is also critical to the association with the cytoskeleton.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between cellular proliferation and mitochondria {{has been investigated}} using cervical cancer HeLa cells. Tumor cells require an ample amount of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) in order to synthesize bioactive compounds such as lipids, proteins, and nucleotides for rapid cell proliferation. The majority of ATP in tumor cells is generated via the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (OxPhos). Interference with OxPhos have shown to cause cell cycle arrest suggesting that mitochondria {{play a role in}} cell proliferation. Mitochondrial ATP production is also vital for cell division in addition to other basic functions in the cell including the regulation of <b>cell</b> <b>volume,</b> solute concentration, and cellular architecture. ATP levels differ at various stages of the cell cycle suggesting that there is a {{relationship between}} the abundance of ATP and the cell's ability to enter a new cell cycle. ATP's role in the basic functions of the cell make the cell cycle sensitive to changes in the availability of mitochondrial derived ATP. The variation in ATP levels at different stages of the cell cycle support the hypothesis that mitochondria {{play an important role in}} cell cycle regulation. Although the specific mechanisms between mitochondria and the cell cycle regulation is not well understood, studies have shown that low energy cell cycle checkpoints monitor the energy capability before committing to another round of cell division.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} ionic {{mechanisms}} underlying the regulatory volume increase of rat hepatocytes in primary culture {{by use of}} confocal laser scanning microscopy, conventional and ion-sensitive microelectrodes, cable analysis, microfluorometry, and measurements of 86 Rb+ uptake. Increasing osmolarity from 300 to 400 mosm/liter by addition of sucrose decreased <b>cell</b> <b>volumes</b> to 88. 6 % within 1 min; thereafter, <b>cell</b> <b>volumes</b> increased to 94. 1 % of control within 10 min, equivalent to a regulatory volume increase (RVI) by 44. 5 %. This RVI was paralleled by a decrease in cell input resistance and in specific cell membrane resistance to 88 and 60 %, respectively. Ion substitution experiments (high K+, low Na+, low Cl-) revealed that these membrane effects are due {{to an increase in}} hepatocyte Na+ conductance. During RVI, ouabain-sensitive 86 Rb+ uptake was augmented to 141 % of control, and cell Na+ and cell K+ increased to 148 and 180 %, respectively. The RVI, the increases in Na+ conductance and cell Na+, as well as the activation of Na+/K(+) -ATPase were completely blocked by 10 (- 5) mol/liter amiloride. At this concentration, amiloride had no effect on osmotically induced cell alkalinization via Na+/H+ exchange. When osmolarity was increased from 220 to 300 mosm/liter (by readdition of sucrose after a preperiod of 15 min in which the cells underwent a regulatory <b>volume</b> decrease, RVD) <b>cell</b> <b>volumes</b> initially decreased to 81. 5 %; thereafter <b>cell</b> <b>volumes</b> increased to 90. 8 % of control. This post-RVD-RVI of 55. 0 % is also mediated by an increase in Na+ conductance. We conclude that rat hepatocytes in confluent primary culture are capable of RVI as well as of post-RVD-RVI. In this system, hypertonic stress leads to a considerable increase in cell membrane Na+ conductance. In concert with conductive Na+ influx, cell K+ is then increased via activation of Na+/K(+) -ATPase. An additional role of Na+/H+ exchange in the volume regulation of rat hepatocytes remains to be defined...|$|R
