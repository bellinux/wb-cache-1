60|$|Credit has a great, but not, as {{many people}} seem to suppose, a magical power; it can not make {{something}} out of nothing. How often is an extension of credit talked of as equivalent to a <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> or as if credit actually were capital! It seems strange that there should be any need to point out that, credit being only permission to use the capital of another person, the means of production can not be increased by it, but only transferred. If the borrower’s means of production and of employing labor are increased by the credit given him, the lender’s are as much diminished. The same sum can not be used as capital both by the owner and also by the person to whom it is lent; it can not supply its entire value in wages, tools, and materials, to two sets of laborers at once. It is true that the capital which A has borrowed from B, and makes use of in his business, still forms a part of the wealth of B for other purposes; he can enter into arrangements in reliance on it, and can borrow, when needful, an equivalent sum on the security of it; so that to a superficial eye it might seem as if both B and A had the use of it at once. But the smallest consideration will show that, when B has parted with his capital to A, the use of it as capital rests with A alone, and that B has no other service from it than in so far as his ultimate claim upon it serves him to obtain the use of another capital from a third person, C.|$|E

50|$|A palace {{economy is}} a {{specific}} type of redistribution system in which the economic activities of the civilization are conducted on or near the premises of central administration complexes, the palaces of absolute monarchs. It is the function of the palace administration to supply the producers with the capital goods for the production of further goods and services, which are regarded as the property of the monarch. Typically this is not an altruistic undertaking. The palace is primarily interested in the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> which may then be disposed of as the king pleases. Some may become merchandising capital, to be sold or bartered for a profit, or some may be reinvested in further centers, including additional production facilities, wars (economic activities from which a profit is expected to be extracted), favorable alliances, fleets, and mastery of the seas.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{compares the}} {{development}} since the 1980 s of privatization of education {{services in the}} US and the UK. In both countries Education Management Organizations have become institutionalized to some degree, with policy borrowing {{between the two countries}} and a common ideological predisposition toward market solutions. Despite this history, privatization remains small-scale and not especially lucrative to those entering the market. In the UK, the emphasis has been on Compulsory Competitive Tendering and the Private Finance Initiative: public sector structures to aid privatization within a governmental system. The result is privatization at 'glacial speed', with few opportunities for EMOs. In the US, it is the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> markets and the roll-out of charter schooling which have sustained privatization- the activities of companies such as Edison and TesseracT are considered.

40|$|Abstract: Recently internationalized firms from {{emerging}} markets have started gaining {{importance in the}} world. This research attempts {{to contribute to the}} study of internationalized firms from {{emerging markets}} by analyzing the different ways in which internationalization has evolved in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. The main argument of this research is that state indirect and direct actions have shaped the type of internationalization in these three countries. A state that can enhance strong pro-market institutions {{but at the same time}} it does not hesitate to use a more direct type of intervention will most likely have higher levels of firms ’ internationalization. In this sense, the way privatizations are implemented, the specific incentives for the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> availability for private firms as well as consistent public policies and institutional stability are the central mechanisms by which the state influences the internationalization of domestic firms. Direct intervention has proven successful in several Brazilian sectors as well as in a select group of Chilean ones. Strong pro-market institutions may help in the process of internationalization in highly competitive and unregulated sectors but additional support seems to be necessary to increase the number and type of industries in which firms internationalize.

The results of the conducted analyses allowed us to assess the effectiveness of the instruments support-ing entrepreneurship used by local government units. The main conclusion derived from the research is that the use of fiscal instruments does not constitute the strongest factor in determining the location of eco-nomic activity. The use of tax forms of support de-pendant on the economic situation turns out to be much less important than the use of solutions such as improvement of infrastructure conditions, selection of areas for investment, lease of commune facilities for economic activities, <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> back-up comprised of loan funds, as well as implementation of organizational changes aiming at better efficiency of the office...|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{information}} asymmetry in the capital structure decisions of a corporation. Such an information asymmetry exists between different groups of stakeholders. Because the interests of those groups are connected with the financing of a company (managers on the one hand, owners and creditors on the other) a thesis may be put forward that an information asymmetry interferes with the financial decision making process. The consequences of the information asymmetry {{can be divided into}} two groups: direct and indirect ones. Direct consequences are the deviations from the optimal investment programme. There are two types of such deviations: underinvestment, meaning a rejection of the positive NPV investments and overinvestment, meaning an implementation of negative NPV investments. The stakeholders' action to minimise the consequences of the information asymmetry can be defined as indirect consequences. The most important indirect consequences include: asset substitution, i. e. replacement of safe assets with riskier ones, signalling, i. e. use of the capital structure to advise outsiders on the true situation of the corporation and <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> sources hierarchy to minimise the direct consequences of the information asymmetry. The information asymmetry nowadays, despite the development of technical possibilities of information transfer, has become a more serious problem leading, in a micro scale, to a decrease in the market value of the corporation and, in a macro scale, to the reduction of the effectiveness of capital allocation...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. We {{report on}} the {{experiences}} {{of a group of}} people as they become Wikipedia editors. We test Benkler’s (2002) theory that commons-based production processes accelerate the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> questioning what knowledge production processes do people engage in as they become editors? The analysis positions the development of editing expertise within broader social contexts to explore how the act of editing supports other types of commons-based production that foster and support and counteract issues of empowerment, equality and social justice. Method. Nine editathon participants were interviewed using a semi-structured interview transcript. Analysis. In a first round of analysis, data was coded into content areas. Then thematic coding examined: (1) the actions of participants as they became Wikipedia editors and the values and sentiments they ascribed to the role; (2) the emerging beliefs and emotions around becoming an editor and the agency and actions triggered by perceived responsibilities. Results. The study surfaced a range of emotions and beliefs editors developed as they took on editing responsibilities, ascribed different values to their new role. These distinct values and beliefs perceived led editors to engage in distinctive forms of action. Some participants developed a sense of empowerment to shape societal agendas, viewing editing as a form of continued activism. Conclusion. The findings pinpoint actions people engage in as they move into the editing role, highlighting the values they ascribe to editing. The study also surfaced the perceived responsibilities associated with editing as well as the emotions and beliefs associated with these obligations...|$|E

The text below was prepared In accordance with this logic, where the Theories of International Development are treated especially focusing on International Economic Development. Therefore, theoretical reflections present assumption side, and study of many empirically measured data will correspond with real facts, because with ought these facts assumption would be useless. Technically this writing consists of two parts: {{in the first part}} are elaborated all theoretical and practical characteristics of overall international development, while in a second part as a case study will be Economic Development i Kosovo. From methodological point of view this is a comparative study and based on statistical data, while problem treating approach is critical and explanatory. As it will be understood later, development theories have been decisively influenced by economic thinking, and the focus on this dimension responds best {{to the nature of the}} term development. On the other hand the fact of unfolding economical development will reflect interference and the nature of it’s inter politics. Today economic development becomes a worldwide goal, having a considerable place in most of the literature with economic content. Also, here are presented as well examples from different practices that reflect economic development in different periods and places. Here is presented international economic development starting with a brief description of a genealogy of this development and ways of economic development back that time. It is of a special importance elaboration through theoretical approach on the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> and economic development, as  mercantilist theory, classic and neo classic theory, than capitalization and Socialism-Marxism. To better understand the nature of economic development, the focus falls on the appearance of the Third Technological Revolution and its role in the world, contemporary economy and as well appearance of the development problems and a need for different theoretical approach. As a separate part is presented international development and its measurement, the one that marks empty topic of analyses. Then, an important reflection on economic growth or economic development provides both multinational corporations and foreign investments, as mechanism of money. Hence, elaboration of these topics has a considerable place within this text linked to their role in the development or exploitation in different regions or countries. On the other hand, another alternative of Development Theories are presented “Theories of Addiction” which will be understood best after giving a broader explanation on economic development or non-development.

40|$|The {{first stage}} of {{economic}} reform in the USSR (1987 - 1988) did not bring any significant practical changes. The crisis on a consumer market has gone deeper, inflation and budget deficit have grown higher and enterprises have still been oriented towards brutto" effects. It {{is the result of}} the lack of consistence both in the sphere of shaping formal and legal grounds of the new economic system as well as in the sphere of practical implementation of accepted solutions. The requisite for speeding up the reform is the elimination of bureaucratic machinery of branch system of administration of economy, i. e. the system which obstructs the process of changes. The reform should be carried out in stages. Basic changes should take place in the first half of the 1990 s. In the preceding years (1988 - 1990) conditions for subsequent reforms must be created, such as rearranging the structure of management, eliminating of influx of inflation money and setting in motion the process of gaining real independence by enterprises. By 1995 basic features of a new economic mechanism should already be fully shaped. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to give up the imperative character of parameters contained in the central plan, to reduce considerably the scope of state obligatory orders and to develop wholesale trade and the market for production goods. The system of economic norms should gradually evolve into a developed, uniform tax system. The latter should become a basic mechanism through which the state influences the decisions of enterprises. The efficiency of anti-inflation policy should be achieved through a two-level banking system and the market for securities. The introduction of fully convertible roubel could be preceded by the implementation of internally convertible roubel, a currency which would supersede the present one. The development of competition depends on the restructuring of economy, the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> market and the influx of foreign capital. The range of centrally determined prices should be limited to goods included in state orders. After 1995 a fully shaped market system should be in operation. It should be regulated by the state by means of a uniform tax system, financial and credit reliefs and state orders. State property should remain only in the areas where other forms of property should prove inefficient. The basic form of property should be the employee stock ownership. The exchange rate of roubel should be shaped by the money market. Digitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|E
40|$|This {{exploratory}} study {{set out to}} uncover views from the Occupy Movement’s Johannesburg leg. The Occupy Movement arose in late 2011, aiming to occupy public space and challenge conventional economics, politics, and governance. Data were collected {{by means of an}} online survey amongst 39 ‘core’ members of the group. The study took up a mixed methods approach underpinned by critical realism. Basic descriptive statistics and cross tabulations were used to analyse 6 closed-ended survey items in a quantitative fashion; thereafter, 4 open-ended items were qualitatively examined by delineating responses into discursive themes based on response content and positions taken up by respondents in their claims and statements. Finally, a cluster analysis was performed in order to cluster or profile significant groups that emerged from the data based on demographics, selection of closed-ended items, and quantitatively transformed response content to qualitatively examined open-ended items. It was found that the sample mirrored the demographics present in foreign movements as it was primarily male (61. 5 %), white (87. 2 %), highly educated (51. 4 % holding a bachelor’s degree or higher) and young (74. 4 % in the 21 to 40 age range). Furthermore, it was found that within a group that stood against various macro-level social systems, confidence in all social institutions was extremely low, in particular for big corporations, national government, and political parties. This sample was highly comparable to a representative South African sample as regards their views on the causes of social division; the factors that were seen as most socially divisive (in descending order) were: (1) socio-economic status; (2) race; (3) politics; (4) cultural differences; (5) language; (6) religion; (7) AIDS/disease. Qualitatively, the first item asked whether or not they believed that their movement lacked focus. Upon analysis it was found that four distinct themes existed in response: (1) duality (those revealing support for the movement but disdain for its processes); (2) aggressive justification (vehement justification and defense of the Occupy stance); (3) denial (lacking full knowledge of Occupy processes but ardently defending them while moving away from the difficult questions); (4) straddling the fence (vague and contradictory positions). Members responded {{to the question of whether}} their movement differed from foreign movements by stating that it did, based primarily on local socio-historical, economic, and contemporary issues peculiar to South Africa – these members sought a special place for their movement and acted in contradiction to the global Occupy stances; others said no and based this on appeals to homogeneity of cause, global concerns, and an Occupy solidarity. When asked why they, personally, were motivated to engage with the movement, the sample maintained either: (1) the unfair world argument (a strong theme in which perceived ‘systemic unfairness’ proved motivation enough); (2) socialist argument (a string of socialist-based positions connected to classic socialist disdain for the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> accruing of personal wealth, estrangement of labourers from produce etc.); (3) personal plight argument (exclusively personal standpoints appealing to individual socio-economic woes). Finally, pressure was placed upon the Occupy protestors to reveal what their ideal, utopian society would look like, given the option. The sample called for: (1) orthodox anarchy (stark calls for 4 absolute anarchy); (2) anarchic socialism (marrying socialism and anarchy – less extreme than anarchy, more equal than capitalism, incorporating multiple freedoms and backed by orthodox socialist rhetoric); (3) advancing through decentralized civil society (no clear ideology, rather providing a special place for civil society with few central power structures; driving forth through family and community); (4) fundamental equality and freedom (emphasis of final desires over process and ideology with a belief that society does not require strict regulation, it rather holds its own ‘homeostatic’ capabilities). The hierarchical cluster analysis for this study found 4 distinct clusters; each cluster was defined by a generally homogeneous set of responses and demographics. Significantly, cluster 3 included 50 % of the cases analysed (50 % of the sample) and uncovered a common profile (homogeneous demographics, vastly similar stances on sources of social division, similarity in terms of confidence in social institutions, and agreement on the rationale and motivation to be personally involvement in Occupy). Cluster 4 consisted of so-called outliers. PsychologyM. A. (Psychology with specialisation in Research Consultation...|$|E
40|$|Ovaj rad nastavak je i opširnije raspravljanje o početcima i nastaja- nju grada Dubrovnika o čemu sam pisao u nekoliko navrata u različitim prigodama. Ovom prilikom proširujem vlastita polazišta iznesena u tek- stu “Dubrovačka pripovijest”, objavljenom u časopisu za književnost i znanost Dubrovnik, n. s., 8 / 4, Dubrovnik, 1997., str. 145 - 161. Taj tekst, napisan ponešto slobodnijim esejističko-znanstvenim načinom, pokazat će se gotovo neizbježnim predgovorom ovome. Razlika je, međutim - a to će pažljivi čitatelj primijetiti - što sam odustao od nekih tadašnjih pret- postavki i zaključaka, isto kao što sam odustao i od onih napisanih prije gotovo trideset godina u zborniku radova ”Arheološka istraživanja u Du- brovniku i dubrovačkom području”, Izdanja HAD-a, 12, Zagreb, 1988., str. 39 - 50, posvećenom tada aktualnim temama koje su bile potaknute istraživanjima pod dubrovačkom Katedralom. K tome i ovdje nastojim opovrgnuti, ili barem dovesti u dvojbu koja bi pobudila razmišljanje, ona ustaljena uvjerenja kako se sve nevolje i stradanja jadranskih obalnih krajeva događaju poglavito zbog pogubnih i strašnih “provala Avara i Slavena” i njihovoga rušilačkog osvajanja gradova Epidaura i Salone. Propast Salone, naime, tema je bliska onoj o propasti Epidaura, a obra- dit ću je u posebnoj raspravi koja, kao i ova o Dubrovniku, polazi dobrim dijelom od pretpostavki koje sam bio naznačio radom o “Jednom pri- mjeru jadranske poleogeneze” (Prilozi Instituta za arheologiju, 11 - 12, Zagreb, 1994. - 1995., str. 63 – 70). Zato u izlaganju podsjećam na to moje odavna izloženo stanovište, a one uvriježene konstatacije o slijedu i nači- nu ugasnuća staroga svijeta u obalnoj Dalmaciji, ustaljene i u hrvatskoj historiogra ji uobličene sheme, navode me da ih pokušam barem dovesti u dvojbu, ako ih ne uspijem osporiti. After a long time, I am {{returning}} {{to the story of}} the origin and formation of Dubrovnik, relating it to the story of the demise of Salona and origin of Split. These two stories often allow me to compare Split (Spalatum) and Dubrovnik (Rausion) because of their similar development. I also attempt to show that, even though these events were always reported in both older and newer historiography, during the transition period from the 6 th to the 7 th century and during its rst decades in these Dalmatian, coastal Adriatic regions there were no mass robberies of “in nite masses of Avars and Slaves”, destruction, killing or similar atrocities which are usually used to mark that period. These conclusions were made based on the narrations of Constantine Porphyroge- nitus and the archdeacon Toma from Split. A closer reading of these sources can show a different course of the rst Slavic settlement, colonization of coastal Dalmatia, as well as the disappearance and formati- on of the aforementioned cities. In the rst chapter (Purpose of discussion), I co- mment the opinions to date, emphasizing that the approach to a topic sometimes depends on the si- tuation in which the authors write. I have already mentioned some of their views in a report published on the occasion of archaeological exploration be- neath and around the Dubrovnik Cathedral. Here, I also refer to my own interpretations of the origin of Dubrovnik which are outlined during the same event. A detailed overview of the ndings was also presented by Ž. Perković in his multiple works on the regional development of Dubrovnik and its Ca- thedral and city churches. Information about the origins of the city which {{can be found in the}} narrations of Emperor Porp- hyrogenitus, priest Duklja, archdeacon Toma and renaissance and later authors is relatively poor. Equally scarce is information about the origins of Split when the narrations of the chronicler Toma are added to those described by the Emperor. The grap- hical representation of early mediaeval Dubrovnik Prospetto della città di Ragusa nel secolo XII, to which I have devoted a signi cant amount of atten- tion, can signi cantly supplement the impression of the written records in certain details. The drawing brings forth data which later writers could not see, although the author of the drawing somehow acqui- red this information and depicted it very well in the drawing. It must be emphasized that, with regard to Dubrovnik, the fact should nally be accepted that it did not originate on an island (or islet), as is still written to this day, but on a peninsula. At the base of its cliffs was most likely a prehistoric structure, and later, a bizantine castrum from which developed a city, an explainable formation and well interpreted name. These have often in historiography been obs- curum. Dubrovnik is, along with Split, as I have written on several occasions in various instances, an exam- ple of one form of Adriatic development (by no me- ans exceptional or unique by European standards), which does not seek an unusual explanation for the creation of the city nor its origins. Archaeological ndings - the discovery of older churches beneath today’s Cathedral and the various structures around it, on the Bunić eld, beneath the Rector’s Palace and its surrounding area - have brought about seve- ral new ndings, but have also allowed for dilem- mas which should not be multiplied with unneces- sary conjectures. In the second chapter (Scope of discussion), I cite several geographic landmarks of the area from Epidaur (Cavtat) to Ston, as well as the historical circumstances which have marked them from the prehistoric era to the nal centuries of the old world. However, medieval cities on the eastern Adriatic coast continue to exist in conditions of reduced pe- ripheral life, outside of the main routes and some German (Langobard and Franc) and, later, Slavic invasions of the Empire’s soil. Therefore, there are no written records about them after the transitio- nal period from the 6 th and 7 th centuries when Pope Gregory the Great mentions them in his correspon- dences with the bishops of Salona, Jader, Epidaur and Risan. He was attempting to resolve matters of congregational hierarchy, realizing and attempting to eliminate various moral deviations and obsoles- cence, which were signi cant and frequent in the Church during the 6 th and 7 th centuries. He wrote about it in his letters to Dalmatian bishops. Howe- ver, his correspondences with the Adriatic bishops were also related to the dangers that threatened them from the “barbarians” with which almost all dioce- san headquarters were faced in the entire Illyrian region and whose threats were very well known. In the third chapter (From castrum-fortress Ra- usion to the same name new city), I describe how during the Roman Empire, as well as during earli- er eras, the surrounding area of today’s Dubrovnik were settled similarly to the entire coastal region from Pelješac, across Ston and Slano, to Cavtat and the Kotor bay. At one of the appropriate locations, on a cliff above the sea and the area in its immediate vicinity, there was a prehistoric structure with an epichoric settlement in which was built a military camp – castrum, probably in mid 6 th century, likely in the period of the Byzantine-Gothic wars. Mo- des of organizing and protecting navigation were implemented in many locations during Justinian’s occupation of the Adriatic and the con icts with the Goths. These locations provided magni cent views which stretched in vast expanses. They were built, of course, not only along the Adriatic coast, but along the coasts of the entire Mediterranean. Here, protection was needed from the eastern-gothic eet, while the northern coasts of Africa and western Me- diterranean required protection from the Vandals. It is because of its location that the former Illyrian structure Rausij also caught the eyes of imperial naval strategists and was, therefore, shaped into a fortress – castrum, a forti cation similar to many others along the eastern coast and the islands. That is precisely where, as well as on the neighboring islands, the privileged population of the city Epida- ur retreats during the time of the upcoming Slavic dangers. Similarly, the privileged from Salona re- treats to the Emperor’s palace in and around which the city Spalatum develops. Of course, they also re- treat to the neighboring islands and their properties. The recognition which Rausij acquired as a na- utical city within a relatively short time period – if narration and construction sources of the 10 th and subsequent centuries can be trusted – was undou- btedly due to the Empire’s dedication to best equip this nautical station at the entrance of the eastern Adriatic coast. It was not only important because of its traf c, nautical and mercantile signi cance, but also because of its strategic value during war con icts with the Saracens who started their attacks around the year 840. Proof of this is the intervention of the Empirical eet during the Saracen siege of Rausij. Alone, without any tradition and signi cant external support, Rausij could not achieve much. It would continue to remain equal in importance to ot- her coastal and island military stations of that late- Antiquity and, later, early mediaeval era. In the fourth chapter (Origins of Dubrovnik), I elaborate on my own previously declared statement that this was a special case of development: the Epi- daurites did not build the city, as Porphyrogenitus claims; rather, they assembled in a location which had been settled for several centuries. There, in the relative security of a military fortress, the immigra- ted social and religious structures created the nece- ssary conditions for a city and during the decades and centuries made it the way it is. In the process which lasted an entire century, the Byzantine for- tress gradually adapted to its new purpose; it was con gured into a new permanent residence. I formerly held the belief that the formation of the city started during Justinian’s era, during the se- cond half of the 6 th century. The 1980 ’s were a time of many explorations and ndings and, at that time, it was believed that an urban society was con gured and a large church was built, which the researchers then called the “Byzantine basilica”. I believed that that type of structure, still being researched at the time and lacking complete documentation, could very well have been built precisely during that peri- od and that it really can be attributed to Justinian’s rather than someone else’s era. The 7 th and 8 th centu- ries, as some assumed, were out of the question be- cause it was unknown who would have been able to invest in such a large structure in that early Middle Age era. Precisely that “basilica”, inadequately de- ned, steered me onto the wrong track about its origin and the setting/time in which it was supposedly built. Huge and appropriately “referenced” by rese- arch, it really could have been from Justinian’s era, especially since, the rst reference was to Poreč- Parentium and the bishop Euphrasius. Today, after Peković’s interpretations of the then discovered structure, as well as other archaeological discoveri- es in the city and Ničetić’s systematic descriptions of nautical circumstances which were important for the development of the city, I am inclined to fully abandon my previously expressed viewpoint. I have dedicated a special paragraph in the four- th chapter to the old drawing Prospetto della città di Ragusa nel secolo XII – saved in several copies and versions - which supports the interpretation of the origin of the City, based on Porphyrogenitus’ narration. Although it has been publicized for a long time, the drawing has recently drawn attention aga- in. Ž. Peković has interpreted it with a recti cation, as well as written commentary in which he descri- bes the development of the city and coordinated it with the Emperor’s records. The author of the old drawing was very familiar with the area and sequ- ence of the castrum’s expansion. Peković showed where the rst church of St. Blaise was and how it was altered over time to form what is known today as the Cathedral. In the fth chapter (“The Byzantine cathedral” and the entity of the new city), I outline doubts abo- ut the argumentations of the beginning and creation as well as the growth and development of the city beneath the castrum, which have multiplied after the research conducted during the eighties. At that time, the attempt was to depict and prove the forma- tion of the city using the time of the construction of the “ rst cathedral” as a reference. The outlined vi- ewpoints were always based on the widely accepted conclusion about the ight of the Epidaurites from the Avars and Slaves and the destruction of their city. Today, I realize that the Cathedral in Rausij is not mentioned by neither Porphyrogenitus, nor Dukljanin, nor Miletius and, as I have already emp- hasized, it is also not drawn on the representation of the city from the 12 th century, the Prospetto. In its place – which is a very important fact in support of Peković’s interpretation – is the church of St. Blai- se. It is a very valuable piece of information becau- se the Cathedral – had it represented importance in the memory of the residents – could not have been forgotten in the noting, writing or drawing of the main structures of any city during any time period. I, therefore, focus my attention on the imperial- Byzantine interest for the eastern coast which has shown itself in a special way after the abolition of the exarchate in Ravenna, the presence of the Fran- cs near the region of the northern Adriatic, and the Aachen agreement and division of politic interests between the Byzantine and Franc empires. Howe- ver the intrusions of the Saracenes in the middle of the century bring signi cant unrest to the Adriatic because they create a possible threat to all the re- gions of the two coasts, both eastern and western. Therefore, the empire’s political and military strate- gy immediately intervenes by guarding the nautical passages and the remaining outposts. The empirical eet, under the command of well-respected drunga- rios Nika Oria, takes actions so that, for example, Rausij could be liberated from Saracene siege (in 866), while at the same time reducing their aggre- ssion on the entire Adriatic and the important passa- ge from the south in Otrant, to the north in Istria and to Venice. That piece of information which is very important in Dubrovnik’s early history, has not, un- til now, been valued at all. After the Saracenes had been driven out of the area, trade and nautical traf c begins to develop, as well as cooperation with other nautical centers, which, at the time, had similar go- als and interests. With regard to the development of trade and nautical traf c, it is also signi cant to note the <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> More speci cally, this perta- ins to the investors who can nance the expensive construction of ships which, in Italian regions, co- mmonly consisted of trade associations focused on the eastern Mediterranean. Conditions were created in Rausij for general advancement and internal con- solidation, as well as religious organization which could build new churches. Therefore, the economic factors give an advantage to “Peković’s St. Blaise” over “Stošić’s Byzantine basilica from the 7 th and 8 th centuries”. I will also add to this that the city was gradually being secured with more adequate walls than those drawn on the Prospetto. In conclusion, in only a few words, I will pre- sent my opinion about the “atrocious robberies of the Avars and the Slaves”; of the destruction and conquest of cities from Epidaur to Salona; of the “in nite masses” which are from almost the be- ginning of Croatian historiography presented as the main culprits for the demise of the ancient world in western Illyria, even though, at least for now, there has been no reliable archaeological evidence whi- ch would witness their “massive” penetration and settlement of this region; neglecting every other reason for this degradation of a previous level of civilization. I therefore remain rm in my belief that cities fall because they are abandoned (Jader, for example, was not abandoned so it did not fall!), and not because they are conquered, destroyed and the inhabitants murdered. A detail from the Saloni- te Šulja crkva which the indigenous people re-built during the middle of the 7 th century is an excellent, undeniable proof of that (note 119). The origin of Dubrovnik, far to the south of Salona, is another va- luable example of a peaceful settlement in a slightly different manner. If I have contributed to the topic evident (or hid- den) in the title of this work with these extensive commentaries and personal re ections, considera- bly changing some of my previous views and expla- nations in the process, it will be a recognition of my efforts to shed light on a small part of early me- diaeval Croatia, speci cally the Dalmatian Adriatic history. So here I am, at the very end, with the wise thoughts of the Venerable Bede who said: Corrige te primum, qui rector sis aliorum. (Bedae Venerabi- lis Proverbia, Pat.
