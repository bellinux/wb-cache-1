40|$|Lake McConaughy is an {{important}} fishery resource {{of the state of}} Nebraska. The estimated fishing pressure in 1975 as determined from a postal <b>creel</b> <b>census</b> was 175, 872 angler days (Morris 1977). This estimate is inflated compared to an on-site <b>creel</b> <b>census</b> conducted in 1977 - 78 which showed a total of 69, 500 fishing trips annually (Madsen 1980). Not all fishermen were contacted so this estimate is undoubtedly too low. Regardless of which figure is accepted, the reservoir provides many man-days of fishing opportunity. Conservation and management of the fishery resource is necessary to maintain and/or improve its quality, An important factor in the management of any fishery resource is the limnological characteristics of the water body, This knowledge is a necessity when coldwater species are part of the fishery. Considerable data have been collected on the limnology of Lake McConaughy (Kiener 1951; McCarraher et al. 1971). Prior to 1969 much of the data were temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles at a limited number of locations on the reservoir. After 1969 some additional data were collected but never thoroughly analyzed or published (Van Velson 1978; Morris 1976), As the result of a project designed to develop a model of the eutrophication process in Lake McConaughy (Taylor 1979), a considerable amount of physicochemical data were collected from 1976 through 1978.

40|$|An {{intensive}} <b>creel</b> <b>census</b> and marking {{program was}} conducted in 1969 and 1970 to make possible population estimates and estimates of harvest of cutthroat trout in the Snake River in Teton County, Wyoming. Stock density determinations made {{in one of the}} five study areas provided an estimate of 400 and 992 cutthroat trout, eight inches or more in length, per mile of stream in 1969 and 1970 respectively. Harvest data provide an estimate of 5, 207 and 5, 903 cutthroat trout harvested in 1969 and 1970 respectively. The harvest estimates obtained in this study are not comparable to those made in 1967 and 1968 due to a difference in the methods used in obtaining these data. The catches of cutthroat trout per hour in 1969 and 1970 were calculated to be 0. 31 and 0. 30 respectively, These relatively low success rates are coincident with the fluctuating volume flows of the Snake River.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the commercial shad fishery on the Waccamaw and Pee Dee Rivers, South Carolina, during 1974, 1975, and 1976. A <b>creel</b> <b>census</b> was conducted to determine the effort, catch, and success for the commercial fishermen. The fisheries were valued at approximately $ 39, 000 annually. The approximate annual harvest for 1974, 1975, and 1976 was 99, 000, 96, 000, and 64, 000 lbs, respectively. These harvest figures represent a drastic decline from the 1896 data. Additional data was gathered on the life history of American shad in the Waccamaw-Pee Dee system. The majority of spawning fish were four and five years old, with the males generally younger than the females. No evidence of repeat spawning was found. The population of commercially harvestable fish varied around 80, 000. Escapement rates from commercial fishing effort for the males was approximately 80 % and females 68 %. Peak spawning activity occurred in April at water temperatures between 13. 9 C and 20. 6 C. The Pee Dee River was the major spawning stream, with little evidence of spawning in the upper Waccamaw River. The major nursery areas for juvenile shad were seaward of the 40 river mile limit with the majority of American shad moving into the ocean by March of the year following their hatching. Management recommendations were aimed at restoring the commercial catch to acceptable levels...|$|E
40|$|The Michigan Department of Natural Resources, in {{conjunction}} with the University of Michigan and the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, initiated a research study to determine the impact of double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) on the yellow perch (Perca flavescens) population in the Les Cheneaux Islands area of northern Lake Huron. Aerial and nesting colony counts were conducted to monitor cormorant abundance. <b>Creel</b> <b>census</b> counts and tagging of 8, 400 perch were used to study perch abundance. We collected 373 cormorants to study food habits via stomach-content analysis. We found that (1) cormorants fed heavily on yellow perch in early spring, but over the entire season only 10 percent of their diet was perch; (2) alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) and sticklebacks (Culaea inconstans, Pungitius pungitius, Gasterosteus aculeatus) made up the major portion of the cormorants’ diet; (3) cormorants removed only 2. 3 percent of the available perch biomass (v. 1. 8 percent by anglers over the same period); (4) most fish taken by cormorants were less than 150 mm long; (5) total annual perch mortality was about 45 percent, of which less than 9 percent was due to cormorants; and (6) cormorants accounted for only 0. 8 percent of the mortality of legal-size perch (≥ 178 mm), whereas summer sport fishing accounted for 2. 5 percent. Thus, although the impact of cormorants on the perch population may vary slightly from year to year, we conclude that cormorant predation had minimal impact on the local perch population...|$|E
40|$|Commercial and {{recreational}} harvests of fish from two eastern Australian coastal rivers, the Richmond and the Clarence, have been compared {{for the period}} from March 1988 to May 1989, using commercial fisheries statistics and a roving <b>creel</b> <b>census</b> of daytime recreational anglers. For both rivers, sea mullet (Mugil cephalus) made up about 70 % of the commercial catch by weight but was not caught in significant numbers by anglers. Fish species harvested in large numbers by both sectors were yellowfin bream (Acanthopagrus australis), dusky flathead (Platycephalus fiscus), luderick (Girella tricuspidata), sand whiting (Sillago ciliata), mulloway (Argyrosomus hololepidotus) and tailor (Pomatomus saltatrix). For the Richmond River, yellowfin bream, dusky flathead and tailor were harvested principally by recreational anglers; sand whiting were equally shared between fishing sectors, and harvests of luderick and mulloway were dominated by commercial fishers. For the Clarence River, which supports {{one of the largest}} estuarine-based commercial fisheries in Australia, tailor were harvested principally by recreational anglers; yellowfin bream, dusky flathead and mulloway were equally shared between fishing sectors, and sand whiting and luderick were taken predominantly by commercial fishers. Although data on recreational fishing throughout Australia are limited, anglers now appear to be the dominant harvesters of several estuarine fish species. As {{in other parts of the}} world, the numbers of recreational anglers in Australian waters appear to be increasing, and this situation is likely to lead to both heightened conflict between the user groups and increased exploitation of a limited resource. The need for sustained and cost-effective monitoring of recreational angler effort and harvests is emphasized...|$|E
40|$|The surf fishing {{investigation}} was begun when {{a need for}} more knowledge of the most important surf species became apparent. Discussions held with surf fishermen and biologists familiar with surf fishing conditions, indicated an apparent decline in fishing success. As a first step, a study was made to determine the most important game species in the fishery. A preliminary survey indicated that these were barred surfperch, Amphistichus argenteus, California corbina, Menticirrhus undulatus, spotfin croaker, Roncador stearnsi, yellowfin croaker, Umbrina roncador, and opaleye, Girella nigricans. The latter was not studied by the project because it is more truly a rocky shore dweller than a surf inhabitant. The essential life histories of the four remaining species (hereafter designated project species) were studied. A voluntary catch record system and a <b>creel</b> <b>census</b> were used to provide information on the relative importance of each and fishing success along the entire southern California coast. This information was needed before steps could be taken to insure sound management of the resource. The results of the surf fishing investigation will appear in two separate publications: this bulletin on barred surfperch and a later one on California corbina, and spotfin and yellowfin croakers. The present paper deals almost exclusively with the barred surfperch, family Embiotocidae, the most important species to the surf fisherman. Barred surfperch range from Bodega Bay, central California, to Santa Rosalia Bay, central Baja California. Although found primarily in or near the breaking surf along sandy beaches they were captured by project personnel in 15 fathoms of water in Santa Monica Bay during June 1957. A trawl boat operator reported that he took large barred surfperch regularly in 40 fathoms off Morro Bay during the winter. Ulrey and Greeley (1928) had previously reported one trawled from 28 fathoms in Santa Monica Bay...|$|E
40|$|Fish ladders {{were built}} on the Grand River to allow {{anadromous}} salmonids to migrate from Lake Michigan to the Lansing area (184 miles upstream). The first ladder was completed at Grand Rapids in 1975 and five other ladders were completed between there and Lansing in 1981. This study was started in fall of 1982 to evaluate (1) the species composition of fish using the ladders, (2) {{the effectiveness of the}} ladders for passing fish, and (3) the fishing pressure and catch of anadromous fish. Fish using the fish ladders were sampled initially with dip nets and trap nets, but these nets missed some species and some larger salmonids. A combination of drawdown and DC electrofishing gave better samples. Apparently, all species appeared to migrate up through the ladders without difficulty. Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), suckers (Moxostoma spp. and Catostomus spp.), and steelhead (Salmo gairdneri) were the most frequent users. Fair numbers of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieui), carp (Cyprnus carpio), and walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) used the ladders also. Visual counts were made at each fish ladder in spring and fall on a random around-the-clock basis to measure the number of salmonids moving upstream. The ladders above Grand Rapids were essentially 100 % efficient in passing salmonids. Generally, the number of salmonids migrating past upstream points declined curvilinearly with distance. Many fish were removed by anglers, strayed into major tributaries, or stopped to spawn between Grand Rapids and Lyons. Spring floods appeared to aid steelhead migration but hindered fishing. <b>Creel</b> <b>census</b> was used to measure fishing. In the fall, chinook salmon and coho salmon comprised 66. 9 % of the catch, on the average. Most were caught below the 6 th Street Dam at Grand Rapids. Few salmon (9. 5 % m, less than 4, 000 per year) were caught in the Lansing area. The spring salmonid catch, made up almost entirely of steelhead, occurred between Grand Rapids and Lyons. Returns of stocked salmonids to the Grand River fishery were roughly estimated by comparing average number stocked to average number harvested. Returns were about 2. 8 % for coho, 3. 4 % for chinook, and 2. 2 % for steelhead...|$|E
40|$|Koktneesalmon (Oncorhvnchusnerka), the land-locked form of sockeye salmon, were {{originally}} introduced to Flathead Lake in 1916. My 1933, kokanee had become {{established in the}} lake and provided a popular summer trolling fishery {{as well as a}} fall snagging fishery in shoreline areas. Presently, Flathead Lake supports the second highest fishing pressure of any lake or reservoir in Montana (Montana Department of Fish and Game 1976). During 1981 - 82, the lake provided 168, 792 man-days of fishing pressure. Ninety-two percent of the estimated 536, 870 fish caught in Flathead Lake in 1981 - 82 were kokanee salmon. Kokanee also provided forage for bull trout seasonally and year round for lake trout. Kokanee rear to maturity in Flathead Lake, then return to various total grounds to spawn. Spawning occurred in lake outlet streams, springs, larger rivers and lake shoreline areas in suitable but often limited habitat. Shoreline spawning in Flathead Lake was first documented in the mid- 1930 's. Spawning kokanee were seized from shoreline areas in 1933 and 21, 000 cans were processed and packed for distribution to the needy. Stefanich (1953 and 1954) later documented extensive but an unquantified amount of spawning along the shoreline as well as runs in Whitefish River and McDonald Creek in the 1950 's. A <b>creel</b> <b>census</b> conducted in 1962 - 63 determined 11 to 13 percent of the kokanee caught annually were taken during the spawning period (Robbins 1966). During a 1981 - 82 <b>creel</b> <b>census,</b> {{less than one percent of}} the fishermen on Flathead Lake were snagging kokanee (Graham and Fredenberg 1982). The operation of Kerr Dam, located below Flathead Lake on the Flathead River, has altered seasonal fluctuations of Flathead Lake. Lake levels presently remain high during kokanee spawning in November and decline during the incubation and emergence periods. Groundwater plays an important role in embryo and fry survival in redds of shoreline areas exposed by lake drawdown. Stefanich (1954) and Domrose (1968) found live eggs and fry only in shoreline spawning areas wetted by groundwater seeps. Impacts of the operation of Kerr Dam on lakeshore spawning have not been quantified. Recent studies have revealed that operation of Hungry Horse Dam severely impacted successful kokanee spawning and incubation in the Flathead River above Flathead Lake (Graham et al. 1980, McMullin and Graham 1981, Fraley and Graham 1982 and Fraley and McMullin 1983). Flows from Hungry Horse Dam to enhance kokanee reproduction in the river system have been voluntarily met by the Bureau of Reclamation since 1981. In lakeshore spawning areas in other Pacific Northwest systems, spawning habitat for kokanee and sockeye salmon was characterized by seepage or groundwater flow where suitable substrate composition existed (Foerster 1968). Spawning primarily occurred in shallower depths (< 6 m) where gravels were cleaned by wave action (Hassemer and Rieman 1979 and 1980, Stober et al. 1979 a). Seasonal drawdown of reservoirs can adversely affect survival of incubating kokanee eggs and fry spawned in shallow shoreline areas. Jeppon (1955 and 1960) and Whitt (1957) estimated 10 - 75 percent kokanee egg loss in shoreline areas of Pend Oreille Lake, Idaho after regulation of the upper three meters occurred in 1952. After 20 years of operation, Bowler (1979) found Pend Oreille shoreline spawning to occur in fewer areas with generally lower numbers of adults. In studies on Priest Lake, Idaho, Bjornn (1957) attributed frozen eggs and stranded fry to winter fluctuations of the upper three meters of the lake. Eggs and fry frozen during winter drawdown accounted for a 90 percent loss to shoreline spawning kokanee in Donner Lake, California (Kimsey 1951). Stober et al. (1979 a) determined irrigation drawdown of Banks Lake, Washington reduced shoreline survival during five of the seven years the system was studied. The goal of this phase of the study was to evaluate and document effects of the operation of Kerr Dam on kokanee shoreline reproduction in Flathead Lake. Specific objectives to meet this goal are: (1) Delineate the extent of successful shoreline spawning in Flathead Lake both on-shore (to an approximate depth of 6. 1 m below full pool elevation) and off-shore (approximately 6. 1 - 21. 3 m below full pool elevation). (2) Quantify and qualify influence of groundwater on reproductive success of on-shore spawners. The effects of groundwater on spawning and incubation on off-shore spawners will also be studied. Rates of groundwater discharge and groundwater chemistry will be established in spawning and non-spawning areas. Those data will be compared and contrasted in an attempt to delineate parameters affecting spawning site selection and embryo success. (3) Determine the relative contributions of major spawning areas to the total kokanee population...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to conduct {{physical}} and biological surveys of streams located on the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation. Surveys were designed to collect information on improving spawning habitat, rearing habitat, and access to spawning tributaries for bull trout and cutthroat trout and to evaluate the existing fish stocks. The objectives of the second year of the study were to: (1) Develop a stream ranking system to select the five streams of primary fisheries potential; (2) Conduct physical field surveys; (3) Determine population dynamics; (4) Determine growth rates of existing trout species; (5) Determine macroinvertebrate densities and diversities; and (6) Determine baseline angler utilization. The Missouri method of evaluating stream reaches was modified and utilized to rank the ten tributaries (as determined by Graves et al. 1990) associated with reservation lands. The method incorporated such data as stream bank and bed stability, condition of riparian vegetation, land use, degree of urbanization, passage barriers, water quality, flow and temperature regimes, as well as the overall habitat suitability for all life history stages of cutthroat and bull trout. This data was then combined with relative abundance data, growth rates and invertebrate densities to choose five streams, which offer the best potential habitat, for further study. Relative abundance estimates resulted in the capture of 6, 138 fish from June, August, and October, 1991. A total of 427 cutthroat trout were collected from all sampled tributaries. Relative abundance of cutthroat trout for all tributaries was 6. 7 %. Fighting Creek had the highest abundance of cutthroat trout at 93. 1 %, followed by Evans Creeks at 30. 8 %, Lake Creek at 12. 1 %, Hell's Gulch at 11. 1 %, Alder Creek at 3. 3 %, Benewah Creek at 2. 1 % and Plummer/Little Plummer creeks at 5 %. Population estimates were conducted in Benewah, Alder, Evans and Lake creeks. Estimates were: 23. 5 {+-} 2. 3 fish/l, 922. 6 m 2 in Benewah Creek, 15. 3 {+-} 2. 1 fish/l, 039. 6 m 2 in Alder Creek, 69. 1 {+-} 36. 4 fish/ 857. 1 m 2 in Lake Creek, and 120. 6 {+-} 20. 5 fish/ 634. 4 m 2 in Evans Creek. Growth rates and condition factors for cutthroat captured in each stream tended to be low in comparison to other streams in the region except for Benewah Creek. Eastern brook trout growth and condition factors were good in relation to other streams in the region. Mean annual invertebrate densities in the tributaries ranged from 1205. 3 organisms/m 2 in Alder Creek to 2885. 56 organisms/m 2 in Evans Creek. Mean annual densities in the drift ranged from 21. 3 organisms/m 2 in Alder Creek to 265. 7 organisms/m 2 in Evans Creek. Invertebrate densities were comparable to other streams of the same size in the region. Angler effort was determined to be minimal to nonexistent. Compliance with Idaho fish and game regulations regarding stream closures during spawning migrations limited the amount of angler utilization within the tributaries. Low to intermittent flow conditions in the tributaries during open fishing season also decreased angler pressure. Fishing pressure was heaviest by tribal members in late May during peak spawning runs. When runs began to diminish, fishing pressure declined. Fishing pressure was heaviest on those tributaries that were known to have existing runs of cutthroat trout such as Benewah and Lake creeks. Due to the lack of anglers, <b>creel</b> <b>census</b> were eliminated in early August...|$|E
40|$|Certain {{aspects of}} the biology of two species of fish, {{bluegill}} (Lepomis macrochirus) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), and the assessment of fishing pressure upon the sport fishery of Pelican Lake, Uintah County, Utah, a 680 ha warmwater lake, were studied between April 1, 1976 and June 30, 1978. The growth rate of bluegills (sexes combined) was fairly rapid; the mean back-calculated total lengths from ages one through nine were 55, 112, 166, 194, 211, 229, 245, 256 and 259 mm. The growth of largemouth bass was 104, 194, 271, 316, 350, 405 and 416 mm total length for ages one through seven for the combined sexes. Male bluegills matured earlier in life than females. Bluegills spawned continually from the first of June to the first of September, although the peak spawning occurred in June of both years. Gonadal weight to body weight ratios (maturity index) were greatest {{in the first of}} June for both male and female bluegills. Fecundity estimates ranged from 1 1, 102 mature ova for an age II bluegill to 4 6, 281 mature ova for an age V bluegill. Fecundity estimates for largemouth bass ranged from 4, 810 mature ova for a II year old to 31, 719 mature ova for a V year old. Largemouth bass spawned primarily in late May in 1976 and early June in 1977. Angler use of the lake was estimated to be 10, 054 angler days fished in 1975, culminating a seven-year increase in use, with subsequent declines in angling to 8, 001 angler days in 1976 and 5, 027 in 1977. A significant winter fishery developed in 1978. Anglers harvested an estimated 58, 277, 44, 918 and 22, 469 bluegills and 5, 791, 2, 747 and 4, 176 largemouth bass in 1975, 1976 and 1977, respectively. Angler catch rates for bluegills in respective years were 1. 520, 1. 640 and 1. 130 fish/hr and 0. 204, 0. 094 and 0. 213 fish/hr for largemouth bass. Bluegill age groups IV and V and largemouth bass age group III composed the majority of angler harvested fish in 1976 and 1977. Age and size composition of angler harvested bluegills indicated no statistically significant change between 1976 and 1977. Bass harvested by anglers in 1977 were significantly greater in weight than those harvested in 1976. The total annual mortality determined from scale analyses of angler harvested fish was 59. 9 % for bluegill and 71. 6 % for bass. A significant number of male bluegills was harvested by anglers in June 1977, the period of peak nesting activity. Anglers released 5, 158 bluegills in 1977, of which an estimated 11 % (565) were lost to hooking mortality. Of various hook sizes used to assess hooking mortality, number 8 regular shank hooks yielded the highest total mortality (18 %). The lowest hooking mortality was with number 6 regular shank jig hooks (0 %) and where the leader was cut and the hook allowed to remain (0 %). Higher mortality of worm-hooked fish was attributed largely to anatomical location of hooking. Of the total (19) bluegill mortalities, 63 % were hooked in the esophagus and 37 % in the gill/gill arch. Postwinter population sampling in May 1977 indicated the estimated standing crop weight was 40 % less than the prewinter standing crop weight in Au gust 1976. A similar loss in standing crop (37 %) was noted in weight from August 1977 to June 1978. The greatest loss in numbers was in young-of-the-year bluegill that suffered an estimated 98 % overwinter mortality. Midwinter water quality analyses indicated that anoxic conditions occurred from 2. 0 m below the ice to the bottom. An increase in hydrogen sulfide levels was also detected. Recommendations for the fishery were (1) adjustment of the daily bag limit for the bluegill sport fishery with fluctuations in angling use; (2) continuation of a <b>creel</b> <b>census</b> from April 1 through July 31 similar to the design used in this study to annually assess angling use, catch rates, total harvest and the size and age composition of this harvest; (3) stomach analyses of potential predators to assess the overwinter mortality of blue gills; (4) retainment of the current bag limit on largemouth bass with future consideration of utilizing a 12 - 15 -in (305 - 381 mm) total length limit to increase the numbers of larger, older bass in the population; (5) nonrestrictive use of terminal gear by anglers since hooking mortality of bluegills caught and released by anglers in the summer of 1977 was insignificant; (6) no size length restrictions on the bluegills retained by anglers; and (7) consideration of purchasing additional water storage from the irrigation company...|$|E
