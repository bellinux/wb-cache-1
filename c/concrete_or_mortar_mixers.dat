The excellence and promising benefits of modified composites have led to numerous progressive studies of its application. This paper presented a critical review from previous research on the polymer modified concrete and mortar. Both fresh and hardened state behaviours were reviewed as they are important for the development of excellent engineering material. Most of the applications of polymer modified concrete and mortar can be seen in diverse types of polymer such as latex, epoxy and emulsion.

The results of this study indicate that both mechanical properties and durability of concrete are greatly dependent on the replacement levels of silica fume. As the replacement level of silica fume increased, the mechanical properties including compressive and flexural strengths, and static modulus of elasticity were proportionally enhanced.

Many engineers usually have little information on the chemical compositions of cement in making decisions for the choice of commercially available Portland cement in Ghana.
