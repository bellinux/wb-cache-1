5|$|<b>Cherry</b> {{was born}} on 4 June 1895 at Drysdale, Victoria, to John Gawley <b>Cherry</b> and his wife Elizabeth, née Russel. When he was seven years old, {{the family moved to}} Tasmania and took up an apple orchard near Cradoc. <b>Cherry</b> {{attended}} the local state school until he was thirteen, after which he received private tuition. He worked with his father and became an expert apple packer; at fourteen he won a local case-making competition at the Launceston Fruit Show by packing thirty-five cases of apples in an hour. Joining the Australian Army Cadets in 1908, <b>Cherry</b> soon became a sergeant and later a second lieutenant, where he used to drill cadets in four different districts. At the age of sixteen, he won the President's Trophy and Gold Medal for being the best shot at the rifle range in Franklin. He also rowed with the Franklin rowing club, played the cornet in the Franklin brass band and sang in the Anglican church choir. In 1913, <b>Cherry</b> joined the Citizens Military Force and was commissioned into the 93rd Infantry Regiment as a second lieutenant.|$|E

Three days later, the 26th Battalion was withdrawn from Gallipoli and evacuated to Egypt where <b>Cherry</b> rejoined them in preparation for service on the Western Front. Remaining in Egypt during this time, <b>Cherry</b> was selected to attend a machine gun course in March 1916.

40|$|AbstractHarvesting {{practices}} in most coffee farms in Indonesia, due to some reasons, have resulted not only red coffee <b>cherries</b> but also green, yellow and deep red <b>cherries.</b> This is suspected {{to be the}} cause of low quality coffee beans encountered by traders. This research aimed to characterize some engineering properties of coffee beans produced from wet process in respect to different colors of coffee <b>cherries,</b> and to especially highlight engineering properties of beans from green and deep red <b>cherries.</b> Non Factorial Simple Random Sampling Experimental Design was used for experiment and then ANOVA and DMRT 5 % of SPSS statistical package programs were employed to analyze the experimental data. The result of experiments indicated that some engineering properties varied among the beans from different colors of coffee <b>cherries.</b> The length, frontal area, weight of 1000 beans, porosity, density and true density of beans processed from green <b>cherries,</b> and weight of 1000 beans and angle of repose of beans produced from deep red <b>cherries</b> were significantly different from those of beans resulted from the other <b>cherries.</b> This finding suggested that the first 6 and the second 2 engineering properties might be elaborated to separate respectively coffee beans of green <b>cherries</b> and coffee beans of deep red <b>cherries,</b> from the other beans...|$|R
40|$|Softening of sound, calcium bisulfite-brined <b>cherries</b> was induced {{fairly quickly}} by brining them with <b>cherries</b> rotted by Aspergillus niger, Cytospora leucostoma, and Penicillium expansum, {{but not with}} <b>cherries</b> rotted {{by a variety of}} other microorganisms, {{including}} Alternaria sp., Aspergillus oryzae, Aureobasidium pullulans, Botrytis cinerea, Cladosporium sp., Mucor racemosus, Rhizopus stolonifer, and Sclerotinia fructicola. Rapid softening was correlated with the presence of a bisulfite-stable polygalacturonase, as demonstrated by a cup-plate test. A survey of naturally rotted <b>cherries</b> suggests the involvement of a bark-canker fungus, C. leucostoma, in softening of commercially brined <b>cherries</b> in the Pacific Northwest...|$|R

The staff writers were <b>Cherry,</b> Goldstick, Spezialy, Pardee, Murphy, and Black; producers Alexandra Cunningham, Tracey Stern, and Patty Lin; co-executive producer Kevin Murphy, Jenna Bans, David Schulner, Adam Barr, Katie Ford, and Joshua Senter. Regular directors throughout the season included Charles McDougall, Arlene Sanford, Larry Shaw, Jeff Melman, Fred Gerber, David Grossman, and John David Coles. Its orchestral score was composed by Steve Bartek and Steve Jablonsky, while the series' theme was composed by Danny Elfman. <b>Cherry</b> also served as the season's show runner.|$|E

40|$|DETECTING DEFECTS IN CHERRIES USING MACHINE VISION By Patchrawat Uthaisombut This thesis {{describes}} {{machine vision}} procedures which {{are able to}} classify defective <b>cherries</b> from non-defective <b>cherries.</b> Defects {{can be divided into}} bruises, dry cracks, and wet cracks. Bandpass filters that enhance the intensity contrast between bruised and unbruised <b>cherries</b> are determined. An optimum combination of two wavelengths is identified at 750 nm (infrared range) and 500 nm (green range). An optimum single wavelength is identified at 750 nm. The image acquisition using these filters is described. Four detection methods using single view infrared images are studied. Two methods perform well in classifying <b>cherries</b> with bruises and wet cracks from nondefective <b>cherries.</b> One detection method using single view green images is studied. It performs well in classifying <b>cherries</b> with dry cracks from non-defective <b>cherries.</b> One detection method using infrared images and another using green images are used [...] ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the former}} example, {{suppose that the}} only {{commodities}} in the economy are <b>cherries</b> and apples, and that no other markets exist. This is an exchange economy with no money, so <b>cherries</b> are traded for apples and vice versa. If excess demand for <b>cherries</b> is zero, then by Walras's law, excess demand for apples is also zero. If there is excess demand for <b>cherries,</b> {{then there will be}} a surplus (excess supply, or negative excess demand) for apples; and the market value of the excess demand for <b>cherries</b> will equal the market value of the excess supply of apples.|$|R

5|$|Another legend {{tells of}} the digging of the church into the ground after the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria (14th–15th centuries), so that the Ottomans would not desecrate it. According to that story, the church was buried and {{forgotten}} about by the villagers until the mid-19th century, when a local coincidentally rediscovered it while tying his donkey to a nearby <b>cherry</b> tree. A different version places the <b>cherry</b> tree {{on top of the}} hill under which the church stood. Reportedly, that <b>cherry</b> tree was struck by a thunderbolt, which enabled the villagers to reach the buried gate through the now-hollow trunk. The church was reconsecrated soon thereafter and dedicated to the 4th-century military saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, <b>Cherry</b> was sent to Claremont Camp and assumed duties as a drill instructor. On 5 March 1915, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force and was allotted to the 26th Battalion, where he qualified as an infantry officer, but was considered too young for a commission in the Australian Imperial Force and was instead made a Quartermaster Sergeant. On 29 June, the battalion embarked from Brisbane for Egypt with <b>Cherry</b> aboard HMAT Aeneas. On arrival, the battalion spent several months training in the desert, where <b>Cherry</b> was promoted to company sergeant major in August. On 12 September, the battalion landed at Gallipoli and played a defensive role at Courtney’s and Steele’s Posts, and Russell’s Top.|$|E
