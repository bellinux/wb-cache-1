5|$|<b>Cirrus</b> {{comes in}} four {{distinct}} species; <b>Cirrus</b> castellanus, fibratus, spissatus, and uncinus; which are each {{divided into four}} varieties: intortus, vertebratus, radiatus, and duplicatus. <b>Cirrus</b> castellanus is a species that has cumuliform tops caused by high-altitude convection rising up from the main cloud body. <b>Cirrus</b> fibratus looks striated and {{is the most common}} <b>cirrus</b> species. <b>Cirrus</b> uncinus clouds are hooked and are the form that is usually called mare's tails. Of the varieties, <b>Cirrus</b> intortus has an extremely contorted shape, and <b>cirrus</b> radiatus has large, radial bands of <b>cirrus</b> clouds that stretch across the sky. Kelvin–Helmholtz waves are a form of <b>cirrus</b> intortus that has been twisted into loops by vertical wind shear.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cirrus</b> {{clouds are}} {{translucent}} {{and so have}} no opacity-based varieties; only one species is opaque, which is <b>cirrus</b> spissatus.|$|E
5|$|On Jupiter, <b>cirrus</b> {{clouds are}} {{composed}} of ammonia. When Jupiter's South Equatorial Belt disappeared, one hypothesis put forward by Glenn Orten was that a large quantity of ammonia <b>cirrus</b> clouds had formed above it, hiding it from view. NASA's Cassini probe detected these clouds on Saturn and thin water-ice <b>cirrus</b> on Saturn's moon Titan. <b>Cirrus</b> clouds composed of methane ice exist on Uranus. On Neptune, thin wispy clouds which could possibly be <b>cirrus</b> have been detected over the Great Dark Spot. As on Uranus, these are probably methane crystals.|$|E
5|$|Random, {{isolated}} <b>cirrus</b> do {{not have}} any particular significance. A large number of <b>cirrus</b> clouds can be a sign of an approaching frontal system or upper air disturbance. This signals a change in weather in the near future, which usually becomes stormier. If the cloud is a <b>cirrus</b> castellanus, there might be instability at the high altitude level. When the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the <b>cirrus</b> radiatus variety or <b>cirrus</b> fibratus species, this usually indicates an approaching weather front. If it is a warm front, the <b>cirrus</b> clouds spread out into cirrostratus, which then thicken and lower into altocumulus and altostratus. The next set of clouds are the rain-bearing nimbostratus clouds. When <b>cirrus</b> clouds precede a cold front, squall line or multicellular thunderstorm, it is because they are blown off the anvil, and the next to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels.|$|E
5|$|Based upon data {{taken from}} the United States using these methods, <b>cirrus</b> cloud cover was found to vary diurnally and seasonally. The {{researchers}} found that in the summer, at noon, the cover is the lowest, {{with an average of}} 23% of the United States' land area covered by <b>cirrus.</b> Around midnight, the cloud cover increases to around 28%. In winter, the <b>cirrus</b> cloud cover did not vary appreciably from day to night. These percentages include clear days and nights, as well as days and nights with other cloud types, as lack of <b>cirrus</b> cloud cover. When these clouds are present, the typical coverage ranges from 30% to 50%. Based on satellite data, <b>cirrus</b> covers an average of 20% to 25% of the Earth's surface. In the tropical regions, this cloud covers around 70% of the region's surface area.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cirrus</b> Fibratus clouds {{appear as}} thin and fibrous looking. Noticeably, {{they are the}} most common type of <b>cirrus</b> cloud. They might {{indicate}} windy weather, since they are mostly formed by wind shear on higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cirrus</b> clouds form {{on other}} planets, {{including}} Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and possibly Neptune. They {{have even been}} seen on Titan, one of Saturn's moons. Some of these extraterrestrial <b>cirrus</b> clouds are composed of ammonia or methane ice rather than water ice. The term <b>cirrus</b> is also used for certain interstellar clouds composed of sub-micrometer-sized dust grains.|$|E
5|$|Contrails are a manmade type of <b>cirrus</b> cloud {{formed when}} water vapor from the exhaust of a jet engine {{condenses}} on particles, which come {{from either the}} surrounding air or the exhaust itself, and freezes, leaving behind a visible trail. The exhaust can also trigger the formation of <b>cirrus</b> by providing ice nuclei {{when there is an}} insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere. One of the environmental impacts of aviation is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of <b>cirrus,</b> and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of <b>cirrus</b> in Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Individual <b>cirrus</b> cloud {{formations}} can be {{the remnants}} of anvil clouds formed by thunderstorms. In the dissipating stage of a cumulonimbus cloud, when the normal column rising up to the anvil has evaporated or dissipated, the mat of <b>cirrus</b> in the anvil {{is all that is}} left.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of their warming effects when {{relatively}} thin, <b>cirrus</b> clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of global warming. Scientists have speculated that global warming could cause high thin cloud cover to increase, thereby increasing temperatures and humidity. This, in turn, would increase the <b>cirrus</b> cloud cover, effectively creating a positive feedback circuit. A prediction of this hypothesis is that the <b>cirrus</b> would move higher as the temperatures rose, increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected back down to earth. In addition, the hypothesis suggests that the increase in temperature would tend to increase the size of the ice crystals in the <b>cirrus</b> cloud, possibly causing the reflection of solar radiation and the reflection of the Earth's infrared radiation to balance out.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cirrus</b> Uncinus clouds {{appear as}} thin and fibrous like, {{except that they}} always have a hook or curl on the tip.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cirrus</b> forms from {{tropical}} cyclones, and {{is commonly}} seen fanning {{out from the}} eyewalls of hurricanes. A large shield of <b>cirrus</b> and cirrostratus typically accompanies the high altitude outflow of hurricanes or typhoons, and these can make the underlying rain bands—and sometimes even the eye—difficult to detect in satellite photographs.|$|E
5|$|Jet stream-powered <b>cirrus</b> {{can grow}} {{long enough to}} stretch across continents while {{remaining}} only a few kilometers deep. When visible light interacts with the ice crystals in <b>cirrus</b> cloud, it produces optical phenomena such as sun dogs and halos. <b>Cirrus</b> is known to raise {{the temperature of the}} air beneath the main cloud layer by an average of 10°C (18°F). When the individual filaments become so extensive that they are virtually indistinguishable from one another, they form a sheet of high cloud called cirrostratus. Convection at high altitudes can produce another high-based genus called cirrocumulus, a pattern of small cloud tufts that contain droplets of supercooled water.|$|E
5|$|The ice {{crystals}} in <b>cirrus</b> clouds have different shapes {{in addition to}} different sizes. Some shapes include solid columns, hollow columns, plates, rosettes, and conglomerations of the various other types. The shape of the {{ice crystals}} {{is determined by the}} air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and ice supersaturation. <b>Cirrus</b> in temperate regions typically have the shapes segregated by type: the columns and plates tend to {{be at the top of}} the cloud, whereas the rosettes and conglomerations tend to be near the base. In the northern Arctic region, <b>cirrus</b> tend to be composed of only the columns, plates, and conglomerations, and these crystals tend to be at least four times larger than the minimum size. In Antarctica, <b>cirrus</b> are usually composed of only the columns, and these columns are much longer than normal.|$|E
5|$|A lawsuit {{brought by}} Lidle's family against the {{manufacturer}} of the aircraft, <b>Cirrus</b> Design, alleging a mechanical defect, was rejected by a jury in May 2011.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{hypothesis}} {{put forth}} by Richard Lindzen is the iris hypothesis in which an increase in tropical sea surface temperatures results in less <b>cirrus</b> clouds and thus more infrared radiation emitted to space.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cirrus</b> Radiatus clouds {{appear as}} {{parallel}} lines {{that seem to}} originate from one point and can stretch for hundreds of miles, and they move parallel to the wind shear.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cirrus</b> clouds often produce hair-like filaments—similar to the virga {{produced}} in liquid–water clouds—called fall streaks, {{and they are}} made of heavier ice crystals that fall from the cloud. The sizes and shapes of fall streaks {{are determined by the}} wind shear.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cirrus</b> clouds, like {{cirrostratus}} clouds, {{can produce}} several optical effects, such as halos {{around the sun}} and moon. Halos are caused by interaction of the light with hexagonal ice crystals present in the clouds, which, depending on their shape and orientation, {{can result in a}} wide variety of white and colored rings, arcs and spots in the sky. Common halo varieties are the 22° halo, sun dogs, the circumzenithal arc and the circumhorizontal arc (also known as fire rainbows). Halos produced by <b>cirrus</b> clouds tend to be more pronounced and colorful than those caused by cirrostratus.|$|E
5|$|In {{a weaker}} storm, the eye may be {{obscured}} by the central dense overcast, which is the upper-level <b>cirrus</b> shield {{that is associated with}} a concentrated area of strong thunderstorm activity near the center of a tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorms {{can form}} dense <b>cirrus</b> at their tops. As the {{cumulonimbus}} cloud in a thunderstorm grows vertically, the liquid water droplets freeze {{when the air}} temperature reaches the freezing point. The anvil cloud takes its shape because the temperature inversion at the tropopause prevents the warm, moist air forming the thunderstorm from rising any higher, thus creating the flat top. In the tropics, these thunderstorms occasionally produce copious amounts of <b>cirrus</b> from their anvils. High-altitude winds commonly push this dense mat out into an anvil shape that stretches downwind as much as several kilometers.|$|E
5|$|Within the tropics, 36hours {{prior to}} the center passage of a {{tropical}} cyclone, a veil of white <b>cirrus</b> clouds approaches {{from the direction of}} the cyclone. In the mid to late 19th century, forecasters used these <b>cirrus</b> veils to predict the arrival of hurricanes. In the early 1870s the president of Belén College in Havana, Cuba, Father Benito Viñes, developed the first hurricane forecasting system, and he mainly used the motion of these clouds in formulating his predictions. He would observe the clouds hourly from 4:00 am to 10:00 pm. After accumulating enough information, Viñes began accurately predicting the paths of hurricanes, and he eventually summarized his observations in his book, Apuntes Relativos a los Huracanes de las Antilles.|$|E
5|$|According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the <b>Cirrus</b> SR20 aircraft, tail number N929CD, {{was owned}} by Lidle. On May 1, 2007, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) stated that the {{probable}} cause of the crash was pilot error. The NTSB was unable to determine which person was flying the aircraft {{at the time of}} the crash.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cirrus</b> Spissatus {{clouds are}} the highest clouds of the main cloud genera. They may form in the higher {{tropopause}} or even at the lower stratosphere. They are dense and opaque, not allowing {{the light of the}} sun or moon to pass through. They are more common on the anvils of cumulonimbus clouds.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 New York City {{plane crash}} {{occurred}} on October 11, 2006, when a <b>Cirrus</b> SR20 general aviation, fixed-wing, single-engine light aircraft {{crashed into the}} Belaire Apartments in New York City at about 2:42p.m. local time (18:42 UTC). The aircraft struck {{the north side of}} the building, located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, causing a fire in several apartments, which was extinguished within two hours.|$|E
5|$|Cirrocumulus clouds form in {{patches and}} cannot cast shadows. They {{commonly}} appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like {{other members of}} the cumuliform and stratocumuliform categories, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into <b>cirrus</b> because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into <b>cirrus.</b> Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species which are common to all three genus-types that have limited-convective or stratocumuliform characteristics: stratiformis, lenticularis, castellanus, and floccus. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.|$|E

5|$|Continued {{effects from}} shear {{stripped}} the cyclone of all deep convection, and by September14 only {{a band of}} <b>cirrus</b> clouds remained in association with Uleki. The JTWC issued their final warning on the system at 00:00UTC that day accordingly. The JMA maintained {{the system as a}} tropical depression as the former typhoon began turning to the east. Uleki later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September16 as it accelerated to the east. The system dissipated the following day near the International Dateline, far from any major landmasses.|$|E
5|$|Due to Langmuir's efforts, and the {{research}} of Schaefer at General Electric, the concept of using cloud seeding to weaken hurricanes gathered momentum. Indeed, Schaefer had caused a major snowstorm on December 20, 1946 by seeding a cloud. This caused GE to drop out for legal reasons. Schaefer and Langmuir assisted the U.S. military as advisors for Project <b>Cirrus,</b> the first large study of cloud physics and weather modification. Its most important goal {{was to try to}} weaken hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Little {{more was}} {{discovered}} about Venus until the 20thcentury. Its almost featureless disc gave no hint what its surface might be like, {{and it was}} only with the development of spectroscopic, radar and ultraviolet observations that more of its secrets were revealed. The first ultraviolet observations were carried out in the 1920s, when Frank E. Ross found that ultraviolet photographs revealed considerable detail that was absent in visible and infrared radiation. He suggested this was due to a dense, yellow lower atmosphere with high <b>cirrus</b> clouds above it.|$|E
5|$|Major {{manufacturers}} in Grand Forks include wind turbine manufacturer LM Glasfiber and small aircraft manufacturer <b>Cirrus</b> Design. Major food producers include potato processor J. R. Simplot Company and the state-owned North Dakota Mill and Elevator {{which is the}} largest flour mill in the United States. Amazon.com and SEI Information Technologies both operate call centers in Grand Forks. Other large private employers in the city include the locally owned Alerus Financial branch of banks, Home of Economy, and the locally owned Hugo's chain of supermarkets.|$|E
5|$|On August 25, Tropical Storm Chloe made {{landfall}} on British Honduras (present day Belize) as {{a tropical}} depression. After dissipating, {{the remnants of}} the storm crossed into the Pacific Ocean, where they contributed to an area of shower activity that persisted over the Gulf of Tehuantepec. On August 28, the tropical activity organized around a circulation which quickly developed into a tropical depression the same day. The depression was upgraded to a tropical storm on August 29 based on satellite presentation that depicted significant <b>cirrus</b> outflow and a commashaped cloud mass spanning 2° of latitude in diameter and was subsequently named Lily.|$|E
5|$|Project <b>Cirrus</b> was {{the first}} attempt to modify a hurricane. It was a {{collaboration}} of the General Electric Corporation, the US Army Signal Corps, the Office of Naval Research, and the US Air Force. After several preparations, and initial skepticism by government scientists, the first attempt to modify a hurricane began on October 13, 1947 on a hurricane that was heading west to east and out to sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} {{moved to}} within 100miles (160kilometers) of Bermuda and slowly intensified. Late that afternoon, Tropical Depression Five had intensified into a 40mph (60km/h) storm {{and was named}} Chantal. Chantal intensified rapidly, intensifying to hurricane status late on September 11. Chantal turned {{to the east and}} gained a weak outflow with <b>cirrus</b> clouds. The structure changed little over the next 24hours, until becoming disorganized {{on the night of the}} 12th. Chantal was downgraded to a tropical storm around the same time.|$|E
5|$|Of the 240 {{people killed}} during the storm, 135 were workers on the Florida East Coast Railway. The {{hurricane}} {{eventually led to the}} end of pineapple production in the Florida Keys for commercial purposes in 1915, although this was amplified by two further hurricanes in the following years. In 1947, Project <b>Cirrus,</b> a collaboration of the United States Air Force, attempted to modify a hurricane; however, the seeded storm made a sudden re-curvature and came ashore near Charleston, South Carolina. As a result, several lawsuits were filed, although they were denied after the path of this storm was revealed to have been similar to the 1906 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|On July24, {{the storm}} crossed 140°W, {{entering}} the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's (CPHC) area of responsibility. Upon entering the region, Gilma became the fourth consecutive cyclone {{to move into}} the CPHC region. Several hours later, Gilma attained its peak intensity as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 160mph (260km/h) and a barometric pressure estimated at 920mbar (hPa; 27.17inHg). After maintaining this intensity for roughly 12hours, the storm abruptly weakened. Within a few hours, maximum winds decreased by 45mph (75km/h) to 115mph (185km/h), a low-end Category 3 hurricane. The reason for the sudden weakening is unknown; although the tropical upper tropospheric trough originally located over the storm, providing it with a favorable anticyclonic flow, shifted westward to the International Date Line. Additionally, the storm's eye became obscured by <b>cirrus</b> clouds.|$|E
