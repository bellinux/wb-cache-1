50|$|There {{has long}} been {{evidence}} that the cytoplasm behaves like a sol-gel.

50|$|Glutinous or waxy type of {{starches}} {{occur in}} maize, sorghum, wheat, and rice. An interesting characteristic of glutinous rice {{is that it}} stains red when iodine is added whereas non-glutinous rice stains blue. This phenomenon occurs when iodine is mixed with iodide to form tri-iodide and penta-iodide. Penta-iodide intercalates between the starch molecules and stains amylose and amylopectin blue and red respectively. The gelation and viscous texture of glutinous rice is due to amylopectin being more hygroscopic than amylose, so it has a higher affinity for water. Thus, water enters the starch granule causing it to swell, while the amylose leaves the starch granule and becomes part of a <b>colloidal</b> <b>solution.</b> In other words, the higher the amylopectin content, the higher the swelling of the starch granule.|$|E
50|$|Interface and colloid {{science is}} an {{interdisciplinary}} intersection of branches of chemistry, physics, nanoscience and other fields dealing with colloids, heterogeneous systems {{consisting of a}} mechanical mixture of particles between 1 nm and 1000 nm dispersed in a continuous medium. A <b>colloidal</b> <b>solution</b> is a heterogeneous mixture in which the particle size of the substance is intermediate between a true solution and a suspension, i.e. between 1-1000 nm. Smoke from a fire {{is an example of}} a colloidal system in which tiny particles of solid float in air. Just like true solutions, colloidal particles are small and cannot be seen by the naked eye. They easily pass through filter paper. But colloidal particles are big enough to be blocked by parchment paper or animal membrane.|$|E
50|$|Typically, gels are {{synthesized}} via sol-gel processing, a wet-chemical technique {{involving a}} <b>colloidal</b> <b>solution</b> (sol) {{that acts as}} the precursor for an integrated network (gel). There are two possible mechanisms whereby organogels form depending on the physical intermolecular inter-actions, namely the fluid-filled fiber and the solid fiber mechanism. The main difference is in the starting materials, i.e. surfactant in apolar solvent versus solid organogelator in apolar solvent. Surfactant or surfactant mixture forms reverse micelles when mixed with an apolar solvent. The fluid-fiber matrix forms when a polar solvent (e.g. water) {{is added to the}} reverse micelles to encourage the formation of tubular reverse micelle structures. As more polar solvent is added, the reverse micelles elongate and entangle to form organogel. Gel formation via solid-fiber matrix, on the other hand, forms when the mixture of organogelators in apolar solvent is heated to give apolar solution of organogelator and then cooled down below the solubility limit of the organogelators. The organogelators precipitate out as fibers, forming a 3-dimensional network which then immobilizes the apolar solvent to produce organogels. Table 1 lists the type of organogelators and the properties of the organogels synthesized.|$|E
