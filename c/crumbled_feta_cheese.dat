40|$|The survey aims at {{analysing}} {{the current}} positioning of Greek <b>feta</b> <b>cheese.</b> A regional UK market is selected {{as a typical}} research location. Four components of <b>feta</b> <b>cheese's</b> marketing mix (country of origin, brand name, type of milk used and price) are included in a conjoint task of product evaluation. Based on the importance assigned to these attributes, the survey identifies a number of consumer segments, and defines those that have a possibility to constitute regular <b>feta</b> <b>cheese</b> buyers. <b>Feta</b> <b>cheese</b> is seen by consumers of the sample as expensive compared to its perceived quality. This perception is attributed to the modest image of the product, which does not motivate a purchasing behaviour typical for a specialty cheese. Findings indicate the pressing need to reposition the product in the UK market. Marketing,...|$|R

40|$|Animal species {{identification}} {{of milk and}} dairy products has received increasing attention concerning food composition, traceability, allergic pathologies and accurate consumer information. Here we sought to develop an {{easy to use and}} robust method for species identification in cheese with emphasis on an authenticity control of PDO <b>Feta</b> <b>cheese</b> products. We used specific mitochondrial DNA regions coupled with high resolution melting (HRM) a closed-tube method allowing us to detect bovine, ovine and caprine species and authenticate Greek PDO <b>Feta</b> <b>cheese.</b> The primers successfully amplified DNA isolated from milk and cheese and showed a high degree of specificity. HRM was proven capable of accurately identifying the presence of bovine milk (not allowed in Feta) down to 0. 1 % and also of quantifying the ratio of sheep to goat milk mixture in different <b>Feta</b> <b>cheese</b> commercial products. In conclusion, HRM analysis can be a faster, with higher resolution and a more cost effective alternative method to authenticate milk and dairy products including PDO <b>Feta</b> <b>cheese</b> and to quantitatively detect its sheep milk adulterations...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of ultrafiltration in <b>Feta</b> <b>cheese</b> production {{is widely used}} especially due to maximal utilization of all milk components, the highest cheese yield and more economic production as well. The aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} influence of differentconcentrated milk samples (whole milk, 3 x and 5 x concentrated, or partially skimmed milk with 1. 8 % milk fat, 2 x and 3 x concentrated) on production parameters, chemical composition and sensory properties of experimental <b>Feta</b> <b>cheese</b> samples during ripening in brine at 12 °C. The control cheese samples from non-concentrated whole and partially skimmed milk were also produced. These samples obtained better sensory scores, during the entire ripening time (28 days), compared to experimental <b>Feta</b> <b>cheese</b> samples. The highest chemical changes were recorded for the experimental <b>Feta</b> <b>cheeses</b> from ultrafiltered whole milk, where total solid content increased for about 24 % after 14 days of ripening. In a case of <b>Feta</b> <b>cheeses</b> produced from ultrafiltered partially skimmed milk, the total solid content increased only for about 10 %. Furthermore, cheeses from ultrafiltered partially skimmed milk, 2 x concentrated, possessed similar composition and sensory properties to control cheese samples from non-concentrated partially skimmed milk. In this case the highest protein content (50 %) and the lowest fat content (36 %) in total solids of cheeses, was obtained. These cheese samples possessed also the best taste after 28 days of ripening in brine. For ripening of cheeses from ultrafiltered whole milk the brine with 20 % NaCl was necessary, but for another <b>Feta</b> <b>cheese</b> samples the brine with 10 % NaCl was desired. The highest cheese yield (59 %) was obtained from ultrafiltered whole milk, 5 x concentrated...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to determine}} the value-added of milk into cheese {{as well as the}} difference between various types of cheeseproduced in the cheese processing business in Boyolali. The method used in this research is a survey method. This research was held on 3 rd February- 29 th April, 2015. This research arebased on purposive sampling to find the research location and samples that close to a dairy farm with an adequate milk production. The results showed that there is value-added in the business of processing milk into cheese. The amount of value-added at each types of <b>cheese</b> is different. <b>Feta</b> <b>cheese</b> generate value-added as big as Rp 5108. 18, Mozarellacheese Rp 2166. 99 and Mountain cheese Rp 4302. 41. The value-added ratio of <b>Feta</b> <b>cheese</b> is equal to 46. 778 %, while the Mozarella cheese is 31. 276 % and Mountain cheese is 42. 493 %. Based on standard criteria, the value-added ratio of <b>Feta</b> <b>cheese</b> and Mountain cheese can be categorized as high while the Mozarellacheese included in the medium category. The conclusions derived from this research that there is value-added in the processing of milk into cheese with the greatest value-added is <b>Feta</b> <b>cheese</b> and the smallest is Mozarellacheese. The greatest ratio of value-added is <b>Feta</b> <b>cheese</b> and the smallest is Mozarellacheese.

40|$|Aims: The {{study of}} peptidase, {{esterase}} and caseinolytic activity of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, Debaryomyces hansenii and Sacchromyces cerevisiae isolates from <b>Feta</b> <b>cheese</b> brine. Methods and Results: Cell-free extracts from four strains of Lact. paracasei subsp. paracasei, four strains of D. hansenii and three strains of S. cerevisiae, isolated from <b>Feta</b> <b>cheese</b> brine were tested for their proteolytic and esterase enzyme activities. Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei strains had intracellular aminopeptidase, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, dipeptidase, endopeptidase and carboxypeptidase activities. Esterases were detected {{in three of}} four strains of lactobacilli and their activities were smaller with higher molecular weight fatty acids. The strains of yeasts did not exhibit endopeptidase as well as dipeptidase activities except on Pro-Leu. Their intracellular proteolytic activity was {{higher than that of}} lactobacilli. Esterases from yeasts preferentially degraded short chain fatty acids. Lactobacilli degraded preferentially beta-casein. Caseinolytic activity of yeasts was higher than that of lactobacilli. Conclusions: The results suggest that Lact. paracasei subsp. paracasei and yeasts may {{contribute to the development of}} flavour in <b>Feta</b> <b>cheese.</b> Significance and impact of the Study: Selected strains could be used as adjunct starters to make high quality <b>Feta</b> <b>cheese...</b>|$|R
