5|$|Having {{dealt with}} the {{pressure}} from the Magyars and the Byzantines, Simeon was free to plan a <b>campaign</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Magyars looking for retribution. He negotiated a joint force with the Magyars' eastern neighbours, the Pechenegs, and imprisoned the Byzantine envoy Leo Choirosphaktes in order to delay {{the release of the}} captives until after the <b>campaign</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Magyars. This would allow him to renegotiate the peace conditions in his favour. In an exchange of letters with the envoy, Simeon refused to release the captives and ridiculed Leo VI's astrological abilities.|$|E

The cessation of revolt was followed by over a decade of peace in Dublin while Sigtrygg's men served in the armies of Brian. However, Sigtrygg never forgot the insult of the Ulaid, and in 1002 he had his revenge when his soldiers served in Brian's <b>campaign</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Ulaid and ravaged their lands.|$|E
5|$|Decius revives {{the office}} of Censor; the Senate acclaims Valerian as worthy {{to hold it in}} a decree dated 27 October 251.

5|$|Jadid's {{government}} {{was the most}} radical administration in Syria's history. The coup created a permanent schism between the Syrian and Iraqi regional branches of the Ba'ath Party and their respective National Commands, with many senior Syrian Ba'athists defecting to Iraq. As {{a legacy of the}} coup, during Jadid's rule, Syria initiated a propaganda <b>campaign</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Iraqi Ba'athists. Jadid's government would be overthrown in the Corrective Movement of 1970, which brought Hafez al-Assad to power.|$|E
5|$|Late Roman {{emperors}} continued {{major and}} frequent offensive operations beyond the imperial borders throughout the 4th century. These were strikingly {{similar to the}} pincer movements described by Luttwak as being characteristic of forward defence in the early Principate. For example, Valentinian I's <b>campaign</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Quadi in 375. Julian in 356–60 and Valentinian I in 368–74 carried out several operations across the Rhine and Danube designed to force the submission of local tribes and their acceptance of tributarii status.|$|E

5|$|Maximian {{realized}} {{that he could not}} immediately suppress the rogue commander, so in 287 he campaigned solely against tribes beyond the Rhine instead. As Carausius was allied to the Franks, Maximian's campaigns could be seen as an effort to deny the separatist emperor in Britain a basis of support on the mainland. The following spring, as Maximian prepared a fleet for an expedition against Carausius, Diocletian returned from the East to meet Maximian. The two emperors agreed on a joint <b>campaign</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Alamanni. Diocletian invaded Germania through Raetia while Maximian progressed from Mainz. Each emperor burned crops and food supplies as he went, destroying the Germans' means of sustenance. The two men added territory to the empire and allowed Maximian to continue preparations against Carausius without further disturbance. On his return to the East, Diocletian managed what was probably another rapid <b>campaign</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> resurgent Sarmatians. No details survive, but surviving inscriptions indicate that Diocletian took the title Sarmaticus Maximus after 289.|$|E
5|$|Mazdakism {{was viewed}} by the Zoroastrian {{hierarchy}} as a heresy and its followers were persecuted by Zoroastrian Sassanian leaders. The Sassanian ruler Khosrau I launched a <b>campaign</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Mazdakis in 524 or 528, culminating in a massacre which killed most of them, including Mazdak himself and restored orthodox Zoroastrianism as the state religion.|$|E
