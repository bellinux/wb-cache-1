25|$|In {{order to}} {{calculate}} with vectors, the graphical representation {{may be too}} cumbersome. Vectors in an n-dimensional Euclidean space can be represented as coordinate vectors in a <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinate</b> system. The endpoint of a vector can be identified with an ordered list of n real numbers (n-tuple). These numbers are the coordinates of the endpoint of the vector, {{with respect to a}} given <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinate</b> system, and are typically called the scalar components (or scalar projections) of the vector on the axes of the coordinate system.|$|E
25|$|Other {{orthogonal}} two-dimensional {{coordinate systems}} involving hyperbolas {{may be obtained}} by other conformal mappings. For example, the mapping w = z2 transforms the <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinate</b> system into two families of orthogonal hyperbolas.|$|E

50|$|A {{drawback}} {{of these}} coordinates {{is that the}} points with <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinates</b> (x,y) and (x,-y) have the same coordinates , so the conversion to <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinates</b> is not a function, but a multifunction.|$|R

25|$|A <b>Cartesian</b> <b>{{coordinate}}</b> {{system is}} a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane {{by a pair of}} numerical coordinates, which are the signed distances from the point to two fixed perpendicular directed lines, that are marked using the same unit of length.|$|E
25|$|In two dimensions, {{if one of}} the {{coordinates}} in a point coordinate system is held constant and the other coordinate is allowed to vary, then the resulting curve is called a coordinate curve. In the <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinate</b> system the coordinate curves are, in fact, straight lines, thus coordinate lines. Specifically, they are the lines parallel to one of the coordinate axes. For other coordinate systems {{the coordinates}} curves may be general curves. For example, the coordinate curves in polar coordinates obtained by holding r constant are the circles with center at the origin. Coordinates systems for Euclidean space other than the <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinate</b> system are called curvilinear coordinate systems. This procedure does not always make sense, for example there are no coordinate curves in a homogeneous coordinate system.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{equations}} {{allows one}} to call on a large area of mathematics to solve geometric questions. The <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinate</b> system transforms a geometric problem into an analysis problem, once the figures are transformed into equations; thus the name analytic geometry.

25|$|Each {{locational}} term above {{can define}} {{the direction of}} a vector, and pairs of them can define , that is, lines of orientation. For example, blood can be said to flow in a proximal or distal direction, and anteroposterior, mediolateral, and inferosuperior axes are lines along which the body extends, like the X, Y, and Z axes of a <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinate</b> system. An axis can be projected to a corresponding plane.|$|E
25|$|In {{three-dimensional}} space, if one coordinate is {{held constant}} {{and the other}} two are allowed to vary, then the resulting surface is called a coordinate surface.

In three-dimensional space the intersection of two coordinate surfaces is a coordinate curve. In the <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinate</b> system we may speak of coordinate planes.|$|E

25|$|One way {{in which}} {{elliptic}} geometry differs from Euclidean geometry is that {{the sum of the}} interior angles of a triangle is greater than 180degrees. In the spherical model, for example, a triangle can be constructed with vertices at the locations where the three positive <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinate</b> axes intersect the sphere, and all three of its internal angles are 90degrees, summing to 270degrees. For sufficiently small triangles, the excess over 180degrees can be made arbitrarily small.|$|E
25|$|The {{geographic}} {{coordinate system}} uses the azimuth and {{elevation of the}} spherical coordinate system to express locations on Earth, calling them respectively longitude and latitude. Just as the two-dimensional <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinate</b> system is useful on the plane, a two-dimensional spherical coordinate system is useful {{on the surface of}} a sphere. In this system, the sphere is taken as a unit sphere, so the radius is unity and can generally be ignored. This simplification can also be very useful when dealing with objects such as rotational matrices.|$|E
25|$|Usually the <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinate</b> {{system is}} applied to {{manipulate}} equations for planes, straight lines, and squares, often in two and sometimes in three dimensions. Geometrically, one studies the Euclidean plane (two dimensions) and Euclidean space (three dimensions). As taught in school books, analytic geometry can be explained more simply: it is concerned with defining and representing geometrical shapes in a numerical way and extracting numerical information from shapes' numerical definitions and representations. The numerical output, however, might also be a vector or a shape. That the algebra of the real numbers can be employed to yield results about the linear continuum of geometry relies on the Cantor–Dedekind axiom.|$|E
