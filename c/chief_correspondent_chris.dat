50|$|Way Too Early was an American {{morning news}} show which aired weekday mornings on MSNBC. It premiered on July 27, 2009 hosted by Willie Geist. It {{has since been}} hosted {{by a variety of}} NBC News on-air talent {{including}} Thomas Roberts and others on a temporary basis, including Ayman Mohyeldin. The final host was <b>Chief</b> White House <b>Correspondent</b> <b>Chris</b> Jansing. It ended August 5, 2016, as its lead-in program First Look was expanded back into the full hour and re-branded as Morning Joe First Look to build continuity with the later program, and presumably because the timeslot is now nearly universally programmed as a morning news slot on local television stations in both the Eastern and Central Time Zones, making the title Way Too Early an artifact.|$|R
