5|$|Elizabeth David, CBE (born Elizabeth Gwynne, 26 December 1913 – 22 May 1992) was a British <b>cookery</b> writer. In the mid-20th century she {{strongly}} influenced the revitalisation of home <b>cookery</b> {{in her native}} country and beyond with articles and books about European cuisines and traditional British dishes.|$|E
5|$|Hannah Glasse's The Art of <b>Cookery</b> made Plain and Easy was {{the best-selling}} <b>cookery</b> {{book for a}} century from its {{publication}} in 1747. It ran to at least 40 editions, and was widely pirated.|$|E
5|$|Science {{classes at}} Mrs. Dow's around 1917 {{included}} Physiology, Botany, Chemistry, General Science, and Domestic Science. The latter class involved different curricula each term: dietaries, <b>cookery,</b> household administration and care, food chemistry, and (advanced) <b>cookery.</b> Mrs. Dow's held psychology, history of philosophy, political economy, social science, and ethics and logic classes.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} the result of several years of research, {{prompted}} by Longman, who had published Acton's Poems. Many of the recipes came from her friends. Modern <b>Cookery</b> quickly became a bestselling work, appearing in several editions and remaining a standard <b>cookery</b> book {{throughout the rest of the}} century. The book was immensely influential, establishing the format for modern <b>cookery</b> book writing, by listing the exact ingredients required for each recipe, the time needed, and potential problems that might arise. This was a major departure from previous cookbooks, which were less precise.|$|E

5|$|The Good Huswifes Jewell is an English <b>cookery</b> book by the <b>cookery</b> and {{housekeeping}} writer Thomas Dawson, {{first published}} in 1585. It includes recipes for medicines as well as food. To the spices found in Medieval English cooking, the book adds herbs, especially parsley and thyme. Sugar is used {{in many of the}} dishes, along with now-unfamiliar ingredients like violets and rosewater.|$|E

5|$|The Oxford English Dictionary of 1888 {{credited}} Raffald {{as one of}} {{the earliest}} sources in English to mention barbecue in <b>cookery.</b>|$|E

5|$|All five of David's early books {{remained}} in print {{half a century}} later, and her reputation among <b>cookery</b> writers such as Nigel Slater and Clarissa Dickson Wright is of enormous influence. The historian of food Panikos Panayi suggests that this is because she consciously brought foreign cooking styles into the English kitchen; she did this with fine writing, and with practical experience of living and cooking in the countries she wrote about. She deliberately destroyed the myths of restaurant cuisine, instead describing the home cooking of Mediterranean countries. Her books {{paved the way for}} other <b>cookery</b> writers to use foreign recipes. Post-David celebrity chefs, often ephemeral, included Philip Harben, Fanny Cradock, Graham Kerr ("the galloping gourmet"), and Robert Carrier.|$|E

5|$|Deighton {{authored}} two television scripts, {{the first}} of which was Long Past Glory in 1963; he also wrote a film script, Oh! What a Lovely War (1969). His long-held interest in cooking—his mother had been a professional chef and instilled a love for cuisine in her son—led to an illustrated <b>cookery</b> column in the Sunday newspaper, The Observer, for two years. The work was collected into two later books, Len Deighton's Action Cookbook and Où est le garlic (both 1965); he subsequently wrote several other <b>cookery</b> books. Deighton has produced several other works of non-fiction, including a study of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, a history of the airship, Second World War military history and a short e-book about James Bond.|$|E

Sales in Britain were over 245,000; worldwide, over 500,000; the book stayed in print until the 1880s. When Rundell and Murray fell out, she approached a rival publisher, Longman's, {{leading to a}} legal battle.|$|E
5|$|The Art of <b>Cookery</b> made Plain and Easy is a {{cookbook}} by Hannah Glasse (1708–1770) {{first published in}} 1747.

Between 1875 and 1914 {{it was probably the}} most often consulted <b>cookery</b> book. Mrs Beeton has been compared on the strength of the book with modern domestic goddesses like Nigella Lawson and Delia Smith.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is noted}} for its practicality, departing from earlier {{practice}} in avoiding plagiarism, consisting instead almost entirely of direct instructions based on Raffald's experience. It introduced the first known recipe for a wedding cake covered in marzipan and royal icing, and is an early use of barbecue. The book remains a reference for <b>cookery</b> writers.|$|E
5|$|Those {{with the}} skills and {{inclination}} to write Welsh recipes, the upper classes, conformed to English styles and therefore would not have run their houses with traditional Welsh cuisine. Upper-class households would take on any English fashions, even adopting English names.

5|$|Tinne {{studied as}} a {{domestic}} science teacher at Edinburgh School of <b>Cookery,</b> between 1904 and 1906, then moved to Aigburth, Liverpool {{to live with her}} maternal uncle, William Brogden Patterson.
