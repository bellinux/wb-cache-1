Our calculations used the Lindhard formalism with Fermi-Dirac distribution and with neglecting the collisional damping.

The inverse of the dielectric function showed antiscreening peak at small phonon wave vector at carrier temperature 77 K and 300 K. The screened scattering rate is strongly enhanced at low electron temperature and high <b>carrier</b> <b>concentrations.</b> This is due to antiscreening property of inverse dielectric function which appears in both emission and absorption screened optical phonons.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the properties of topological insulator Bi 2 Te 2 Se (BTS) crystals grown by the vertical Bridgeman method is described. Two defect mechanisms that create acceptor impurities {{to compensate for the}} native n-type carriers are compared: Bi excess, and light Sn doping. Both methods yield low <b>carrier</b> <b>concentrations</b> and an n-p crossover over the length of the grown crystal boules, but lower <b>carrier</b> <b>concentrations</b> and higher resistivities are obtained for the Sn-doped crystals, which reach <b>carrier</b> <b>concentrations</b> as low as 8 x 1014 cm- 3. Further, the temperature dependent resistivities for the Sn-doped crystals display strongly activated behavior at high temperatures, with a characteristic energy of half the bulk band gap. The (001) cleaved Sn-doped BTS crystals display high quality Shubnikov de Haas (SdH) quantum oscillations due to the topological surface state electrons. Angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) characterization shows that the Fermi energy (EF) for the Sn-doped crystals falls cleanly in the surface states with no interference from the bulk bands, that the Dirac point for the surface states lies approximately 60 meV below the top of the bulk valence band maximum, and allows for a determination of the bulk and surface state <b>carrier</b> <b>concentrations</b> as a function of Energy near EF. Electronic structure calculations that compare Bi excess and Sn dopants in BTS demonstrate that Sn acts as a special impurity, with a localized impurity band that acts as a charge buffer occurring inside the bulk band gap. We propose that the special resonant level character of Sn in BTS gives rise to the exceptionally low <b>carrier</b> <b>concentrations</b> and activated resistivities observed.

40|$|Weak antilocalization (WAL) {{effects in}} Bi 2 Te 3 single {{crystals}} {{have been investigated}} at high and low bulk charge <b>carrier</b> <b>concentrations.</b> At low charge carrier density the WAL curves scale with the normal component of the magnetic field, demonstrating the dominance of topological surface states in magnetoconductivity. At high charge carrier density the WAL curves scale with neither the applied field nor its normal component, implying a mixture of bulk and surface conduction. WAL due to topological surface states shows no dependence on the nature (electrons or holes) of the bulk charge carriers. The observations of an extremely large, non-saturating magnetoresistance, and ultrahigh mobility in the samples with lower carrier density further support the presence of surface states. The physical parameters characterizing the WAL effects are calculated using the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka formula. At high charge <b>carrier</b> <b>concentrations,</b> {{there is a greater}} number of conduction channels and a decrease in the phase coherence length compared to low charge <b>carrier</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The extremely large magnetoresistance and high mobility of topological insulators have great technological value and can be exploited in magneto-electric sensors and memory devices.

The size of the band-gap means that Bi2Te3 has high intrinsic <b>carrier</b> <b>concentration.</b> Therefore, minority carrier conduction cannot be neglected for small stoichiometric deviations.
