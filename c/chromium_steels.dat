50|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} blade designs for pruning shears: anvil, bypass and parrot-beak. Anvil pruners {{have only one}} blade, which closes onto a flat surface; unlike bypass blades it can be sharpened from both sides and remains reliable when slightly blunt. Anvil pruners are useful for cutting thick branches; one can bite into the stem from one direction, swing the handle around and bite further through narrowed wood from another direction. The anvil is made of a material softer than the blade, so that the blade is not damaged when it meets the anvil. Suitable materials for the anvil are plastic, aluminum, zinc, brass, or bronze alloys. The blades are made from hardened carbon or <b>chromium</b> <b>steels.</b> The hardness of the blades is generally between 54 and 58 HRC. On an anvil pruner, proper cutting is assured even if the blade swerves slightly {{to the left or}} right during cutting. As long as the blade meets the anvil {{at the end of the}} cut and fits tightly against it, the material is separated. For this reason, the blades of anvil pruners can be ground thinner than those on bypass pruners. The LÖWE principle - a drawing cut made against a fixed support - combines a drawing cut with a pushing cut. This is possible because the blade lever and base lever are connected by an eccentric bearing. When the pruners are open, the blade is longer than the anvil thanks to the eccentric bearing. When the pruners close, the blade draws back slightly while it pushes through the material. This reduces the cutting force needed to make a cut still further.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The higher steam {{temperatures}} and pressures {{required to achieve}} increase in thermal efficiency of fossil fuel-fired power-generation plants necessi-tate the use of steels with improved creep rupture strength. The 9 % <b>chromium</b> <b>steels</b> developed {{during the last three}} decades are of great interest in such applications. In this report, the development of steels P 91, P 92 and E 911 is described. It is shown that the martensitic transformation in these three steels produces high dislocation density that confers significant transient hardening. However, the dislocation den-sity decreases during exposure at service temperatures due to recovery effects and for long-term creep strength the sub-grain structure produced under different con-ditions is most important. The changes in the microstructure mean that great care is needed in the extrapolation of experimental data to obtain design values. Only data from tests with rupture times above 3, 000 h provide reasonable extrapolated values. It is further shown that for the 9 % <b>chromium</b> <b>steels,</b> oxidation resistance in steam is not sufficiently high for their use as thin-walled components at temperatures of 600 C and above. The potential for the development of steels of higher chromium contents (above 11 %) to give an improvement in steam oxidation resistance whilst maintaining creep resistance to the 9 % <b>chromium</b> <b>steels</b> is discussed...|$|E

Carbon steel presents a wide passive anodic region (0. 0 - 0. 9 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE)), while those of <b>chromium</b> <b>steel</b> and HSS, either as-received or heat-treated, are narrower because of transpassive anodic dissolution of Cr above ~ 0. 4 V.

The semiconductor properties of the passive films were investigated by Mott-Schottky plots. All steel samples behave like n-type semiconductors, showing that the passive film properties are dominated by iron.
