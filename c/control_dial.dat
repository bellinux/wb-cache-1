50|$|The central {{element of}} the MMI {{terminal}} is the <b>control</b> <b>dial.</b> This dial can be rotated, to navigate up and down through menus, and pressed to activate a selected highlighted function. Starting with MMI 3G system an integrated joystick in the main <b>control</b> <b>dial</b> {{can be used to}} (for example) navigate the map. Depending on the MMI generation and configuration, four to eight function buttons surround the <b>control</b> <b>dial</b> which are used to launch the various features. The MMI screen is available as a five-inch monochrome black-and-red or seven-inch 16:9 full colour display, depending on the variation of MMI fitted in the car. MMI uses Media Oriented Systems Transport (MOST) technology to interconnect the various systems. Harman Becker Automotive Systems manufactures the MMI system, utilizing QNX Neutrino's Real Time Operating System (RTOS) software.|$|E

Writing them through the ink channel suffices to make the controls available for the viewer used. Usually, the HTML for the <b>control</b> <b>dials</b> the ink web server through a websocket. Then, the control implementation in the server forwards events and updates to keep the multiple views of the control synchronized.|$|R
50|$|Being a first {{generation}} Virtual Analogue synthesizer, the AN1x's controller resolution responds by default to 128 {{steps from the}} built in control knobs. The result being especially noticeable when slow filter sweeps with more pronounced resonance are attempted. The user can hear slight but distinct 'stepping' of the filter. However several work arounds have been discovered to overcome this. One simple example being {{the use of a}} newer midi controller or synthesizer, whose <b>control</b> <b>dials</b> generate higher resolution movement intervals, the result being that the AN1x does in fact respond to these inputs and step changes sound remarkably more smoothed out. Thus resulting in a more 'analogue' filter effect.|$|R
5000|$|At the 2005 North American International Auto Show, the Volkswagen New Beetle Ragster {{concept car}} was introduced. It was {{supposed}} to be a preview of the future design of the New Beetle. The base of the Ragster (the name denoting a cross between a [...] "ragtop" [...] and a speedster) was a New Beetle Convertible modified with a new roof, giving it a much lower roofline, and a unique paint job with silver double stripes. The interior differs from the original New Beetle, being a 2+2, and having distinctive <b>control</b> <b>dials</b> The Ragster's rear-view mirror is mounted on its dashboard, a retro feature, reminiscent of the first Type 1s.|$|R

50|$|The α700 {{had a lower}} pixel {{resolution}} {{than the}} later α350 (12.4 vs. 14.2), and the α350 included additional features (Live preview mode, automatic pop-up flash) at a lower price. However, the α700 used a pentaprism viewfinder instead of a pentamirror, had a higher burst speed (5 frames per second vs 2.5), had a higher resolution LCD screen, magnesium alloy body, twin <b>control</b> <b>dials,</b> better environmental seals, dual flash media slots (CF and MS-DUO), a PC Sync socket, more autofocus points, a stronger autofocus motor, and HDMI output. The α350's sensor was also a CCD sensor, {{as opposed to the}} α700's Exmor CMOS sensor which granted the α700 superior low-light performance.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} <b>control</b> <b>dials</b> on the device that alter such aspects as tape speed, repeat pattern (an 11-position rotary switch), one {{instrument}} and two microphone inputs, a single analog backlit VU meter {{for all three}} inputs, wet/dry mix for both echo and reverb, and intensity (number of repeats, in a sense; it actually reduces how much the erase/record head erases the tape), that can be adjusted to a user's liking; and bass/treble controls to EQ {{the sound of the}} repeats (not the dry signal), as well as dry and effected [...] "Echo" [...] output jacks with a switch for output setting (-10, -20, -35db levels.) ...|$|R

5000|$|The EOS M10 is an {{interchangeable}} lens camera {{that uses the}} Canon EF-M lens mount. The EOS M10 is an entry-level model which lacks the large rubber grip, multiple <b>control</b> <b>dials,</b> and hot shoe flash {{that can be found}} on the larger and more expensive Canon EOS M3. [...] According to a Canon USA spokesperson, the EOS M10 uses the same 18MP APS-C sensor as the older Canon EOS M2, which was not sold in the United States. [...] The EOS M10 also uses the EOS M2's Hybrid CMOS AF II autofocus system, instead of the EOS M3's quicker Hybrid CMOS AF III system. [...] However, unlike the EOS M2, the EOS M10 features the same DIGIC 6 image processor as the newer EOS M3.|$|R
5000|$|The Panasonic DMC-GF3 uses a {{resistive}} touchscreen {{to provide}} mode selections, {{and as such}} {{that there is not}} a mode dial on the camera.

5000|$|The GF1's successor, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF2 was {{announced}} in November 2010. The GF line has since been extended with the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF3 (announced in June 2011), the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF5 (announced in April 2012) and the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF6 (announced in April 2013). Many enthusiasts decried the {{move away from the}} GF1's button driven interface and the omission of the top <b>control</b> <b>dial</b> in the GF2 and subsequent models. Because of this some feel that the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GX1 is the GF1's [...] "spiritual successor".|$|E
2500|$|A {{small part}} of the {{workings}} of the drives is revealed in Galactic North. [...] The drive has six manual <b>control</b> <b>dials</b> that allow the power of the drive to be varied. [...] As the drive power is increased, so does the risk of an uncontrolled, ship destroying explosion. [...] Lighthuggers mount a pair of Conjoiner drives, both of which are controlled by a disembodied Conjoiner brain that performs rapid calculations to control the internal drive reactions. [...] If the turbulence within the drive exceeds the ability of the brain, the drive will explode. The drive is also designed to explode if non-Conjoiners attempt to open it for reverse engineering, or if the gap between two drives on the same ship grows too large. [...] This occurs because the Conjoiner brain is housed within one of the engines and controls the other remotely; once the other drive passes out of the brain's control, the internal reactions quickly spiral out of control.|$|R
