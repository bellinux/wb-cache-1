5|$|Zones. The {{object of}} this mode is to capture various control {{points on the}} map. Each <b>control</b> <b>point</b> has 3 levels for each team, and a neutral level. A player can do this in other game modes (except deathmatch) to earn points for yourself, but in Zones, their team gains points {{for the number of}} zones the player has, and how many levels each one has. The player will only be able to capture levels if the area around it is clear, or {{captured}} by their team. The game ends when the time runs out, score limit is reached, or if the player is able to capture all control points.|$|E
5|$|In glycolysis, {{hexokinase}} {{is directly}} inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and pyruvate kinase is inhibited by ATP itself. The main <b>control</b> <b>point</b> for the glycolytic pathway is phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by {{high concentrations of}} ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual, since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the active form of the enzyme is a tetramer that exists in two conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two binding sites for ATP– the active site is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly. A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including cyclic AMP, ammonium ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose-1,6- and -2,6-biphosphate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A stereo {{matching}} {{algorithm was proposed}} based on pyramid algorithm and dynamic programming. High and low resolution images was computed by pyramid algorithm, and then candidate <b>control</b> <b>points</b> were stroke on low-resolution image, and final <b>control</b> <b>points</b> were stroke on the high-resolution images. Finally, final <b>control</b> <b>points</b> were used in directing {{stereo matching}} based on dynamic programming. Since the striking of candidate <b>control</b> <b>points</b> on low-resolution image, the time is greatly reduced. Experiments show that the proposed method has a high matching precision. ...|$|R

50|$|In assault, {{one team}} will be {{defending}} from an offensive team, or in rare cases, two offensive teams. The goal of the offensive team is to capture <b>control</b> <b>points</b> in order to seize two or three (depending on the map) main <b>control</b> <b>points,</b> while the defensive team has to defend the points. The offensive team wins if it captures all main <b>control</b> <b>points,</b> while the defensive team can win by either holding out with all <b>control</b> <b>points</b> until a timer runs out, or capturing all the offensive team's <b>control</b> <b>points.</b> Assault cannot be played by players until their player level is 4. This unlocks the assault maps, after which all soldiers owned by that player can play assault, regardless of rank.|$|R

In this example the connectivity {{is taken from}} the camel mesh. In (a) the LS-mesh is constructed with 100 <b>control</b> <b>points</b> and in (c) with 2000 <b>control</b> <b>points.</b> The connectivity graph contains 39074 vertices (without any geometric information). (b) and (d) show close-ups on the head; the <b>control</b> <b>points</b> are marked by red balls. In this paper we introduce Least-squares Meshes: meshes with a prescribed connectivity that approximate a set of <b>control</b> <b>points</b> in a least-squares sense. The given mesh consists of a planar graph with arbitrary connectivity and a sparse set of <b>control</b> <b>points</b> with geometry. The geometry of the mesh is reconstructed by solving a sparse linear system. The linear system not only defines a surface that approximates the given <b>control</b> <b>points,</b> but it also distributes the vertices over the surface in a fair way. That is, each vertex lies {{as close as possible}} to the center of gravity of its immediate neighbors. The Least-squares Meshes (LS-meshes) are a visually smooth and fair approximation of the given <b>control</b> <b>points.</b> We show that the connectivity of the mesh contains geometric information that affects the shape of the reconstructed surface. Finally, we discuss the applicability of LS-meshes to approximation of given surfaces, smooth completion, mesh editing and progressive transmission...|$|R
