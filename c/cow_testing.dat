40|$|Milk {{composition}} varies between herds, {{and between}} cows within herds. The opportunity therefore exists to segregate milk from cows with different milk composition on farm, {{based on its}} suitability for the manufacture of particular dairy products. Benefits can result from increased yields, reduced processing costs or the suitability of differentiated milk {{for the production of}} high value niche market products. A model was developed to determine the break even premium required for farmers producing differentiated milk to be no worse off economically than under the status quo. This model incorporated breeding (quantitative and qualitative traits), cow requirements and feeding, transport, and economic sub-models. Cows were segregated within herd and milk composition was altered over time by breeding. Four quantitative trait ("white" milk colour) scenarios and two qualitative trait (BB Î²-lactoglobulin milk) scenarios were considered. Manipulation of milk composition by feeding was allowed for in the model, although an example was not modelled. The transport model was developed to calculate the increase in milk collection costs associated with differentiated milk and this extra cost was included in the milk volume charge. A cost-benefit analysis was run over 20 years using a partial budget approach. This timeframe allowed for the long transition time required to manipulate milk composition by breeding. The breakeven premium on the status quo milksolids price was calculated over 10 year, 20 year and infinity time periods at a 7 % discount rate. Milk selection on a "differentiated" trait can lead to lower genetic gain in other production traits compared to the status quo. Lower production per cow allows for higher stocking rates (and therefore increased costs), and lower production per hectare. The scenarios modelled also included initial setup costs e. g. vat, <b>cow</b> <b>testing,</b> cow purchase. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on transport costs, premiums, and discount rates. The possibility of redistributing premium payments so a higher price was paid in earlier years was also explored. The premium required to break even for the quantitative scenarios was $ 1. 11 /kg of "white" milkfat over 20 years. The lower production of the "white" milk cows compared to their status quo counterparts had a considerable impact on the premium. The premium was lower ($ 0. 46 /kg milkfat) where a greater proportion of the cows produced "white" milk in year 1. The premium required for the qualitative scenarios was lower, requiring an extra 3. 4 % to 4. 1 % for differentiated milkfat and protein compared to the status quo to break even over 20 years. Production per cow was similar to the status quo for these scenarios, and transport costs contributed to a high proportion of the premium required. Risk associated with a discontinuance of a differentiated milk policy is high. The breakeven premium required was considerably greater when a premium was received for only a few years e. g. $ 0. 92 /kg milkfat for 20 + years compared to $ 9. 66 /kg milkfat if the premium was discontinued after 10 years. The rate of technology adoption will be important to the success of a differentiated milk policy. The premium required for milk differentiation policies may need to be considerably greater than the breakeven value to compensate for risk and encourage technology adoption. Farmers already producing milk closer to the required specifications could initially be targeted. Companies may need to consider taking some of the risk e. g. through price redistribution. Effective strategies involving both industry and farmers will need to be developed to facilitate the uptake of milk segregation. This research model could be used by dairy companies and farmers considering milk segregation policies...|$|E

The functional residual capacity (FRC), lung clearance index (LCI), Becklake index (BI), mixing ratio (MR), pulmonary N 2 clearance delay (PCD), index of distribution of inspiration (IDI) and ventilatory efficiency (EFF) were calculated for each MBNW. The LCI, MR, PCD, IDI and EFF were calculated at an end-tidal N 2 concentration of 3 % (FETN 2, 3 %) and the end-tidal N 2 concentration of the final breath of the MBNW (FETN 2,fb), while BI was calculated and EFF was also calculated at FETN 2 = 8 % (i. e. after washout of 90 % of the N 2 in the lung). All of the MBNW were irregular due to breath-to-breath variability in the breathing pattern of cows and variability in FRC. The within day coefficients of variation for FRC, LCI, MR, IDI, EFF 3 % and EFFfb were less than 10 %, but in the four <b>cows</b> <b>tested</b> on six days there was significant day-to-day variability for individuals for FRC, LCI, BI, MR, PCD and IDI.

40|$|In 2007, BTV- 8 re-emerged for {{the second}} year in the Netherlands and caused {{morbidity}} and increased mortality in cattle herds. In addition, cattle farmers reported reduced fertility in their cows. For this study, fifteen herds that were not vaccinated were selected. These were matched to 10 vaccinated herds by geographic region. At the start of the study, in July 2008, all cattle in the non-vaccinated herds > 1 year old were sampled. All seronegative cows entered the study program and blood samples from these <b>cows</b> were <b>tested</b> for antibodies against BTV- 8 in an ELISA. Cows were sampled at intervals of three weeks and sampling was stopped once a <b>cow</b> <b>tested</b> seropositive. Sampling ceased in all remaining cows in December 2008. Newborn calves originating from infected dams or from vaccinated dams were tested by PCR for BTV- 8. Fertility data were obtained from the Royal Dutch Cattle Syndicate (CRV). Multi-level generalized latent and linear models were used for analyses. In 2008, 185 (17. 2 %) out of 1, 074 initially seronegative non-vaccinated cattle seroconverted and were assumed to be infected with BTV- 8. Infected cows were 5 (95 % CI: 1. 9 â 14. 3) times more likely to return for insemination within 56 days after first insemination. In addition, these cows needed 1. 7 (95 % CI: 1. 4 â 2. 0) times more inseminations for an assumed pregnancy, and needed 2. 5 (95 % CI: 2. 4 â 2. 6) times more days between first and last insemination compared to the period prior to seroconversion and compared to cows not infected by BTV- 8 in 2008. No association between BTV- 8 infection and the chance to abort between 100 and 260 days after last insemination was found.

40|$|Objective/Background: Bovine {{tuberculosis}} {{is one of}} the {{zoonotic diseases}} and important in terms of both public health {{and its impact on the}} decrease in animal products and heavy economic losses. Consequently, its control is warranted. The key in controlling bovine tuberculosis is to test and slaughter the infected cows. In this method, animals > 3 months of age undergo a comparative tuberculin test, and the positive cases are sent to a slaughterhouse. This study reviews the trend of coverage process of testing and slaughtering of infected cows in Iran during 2000 â 2014 to evaluate the bovine tuberculosis control in this period. Methods: In the current study, the data related to the control program of bovine tuberculosis and domestic animal population in Iran were taken from the Agriculture Ministry. Next, the yearly percentage of the <b>tested</b> <b>cows</b> and the proportion of positive <b>cows</b> to <b>tested</b> <b>cows</b> were calculated, and the process was drawn. Results: The results show that the coverage of a tuberculin testing process has been constant. The lowest percentage of test coverage was in 2005 with 11. 8 %, and the highest percentage of test coverage was in 2008 with 19. 2 %. On average, 15. 7 % of cows underwent the program of tuberculin test over this period. The results showed that the proportion of positive cases to <b>tested</b> <b>cows</b> increased in 2008 and 2009, and subsequently decreased in the following years. In addition, 0. 13 % of tested cases in this period were positive. Conclusion: The results of this study show that the coverage of a tuberculin testing process has been constant during this period. If more animals were covered by the program, more positive cases would have been detected and removed; this will have better effect in controlling the tuberculosis. The proportion of positive tests showed that it had been increasing in 2008 and 2009, and subsequently decreasing, which indicates decreased prevalence and efficacy of the bovine tuberculosis control program in the cattle herd that underwent the tuberculin test in these years...|$|R

Actual in-dividual <b>cow</b> DHIA <b>test</b> day milk weight data for three Florida dairy herds in each herd milk yield category and month were adjusted to the mean of their respective actual milk shipped per <b>cow</b> on <b>test</b> day then pooled and converted to a basis of three times per day milk yield per milk-ing. After minor truncation, Weibull probability distributions fitted to these data sets adequately modeled milk yield per milking per cow. Analysis of simula-tion results for milk yield per milking per cow indicated no significant differ-ences between actual and simulated means for any herd milk yield category or month. Simulations of monthly and yearly total herd milk yield for each herd indicated that fitted Weibull distributions also adequately modeled monthly and yearly herd milk yield characteristics and reflected seasonal herd milk yield pat-terns typical of Florida.

40|$|A {{chemiluminescence}} Western blot analysis (WBA) {{for detecting}} antibovine immunodeficiency-like virus (BIV) antibodies, had good repeatability. The test was subsequently {{applied to a}} bank of serum samples from 928 adult cows from 265 herds in Ontario; the number of cows sampled within each herd ranged from 1 to 13. The overall prevalence of anti-BIV antibodies among cows was 5. 5 % with a 95 % confidence interval of 4. 2 % to 7. 2 %. In contrast, 18. 1 % of herds {{had at least one}} reactor among <b>cows</b> <b>tested,</b> resulting in a herd-prevalence confidence interval of 13. 8 % to 23. 4 %. These estimates of prevalence were in the same range as previous reports from the US and Europe. Bovine immunodeficiency-like virus may have a worldwide distribution. Unfortunately, BIV test sensitivity and specificity are difficult to estimate because virus isolation is inefficient. Therefore, the apparent prevalences could not be adjusted for test sensitivity and specificity, to estimate the true prevalence of infection. The serum samples had previously been tested for antibodies to bovine leukemia virus (BLV). There were no significant associations between BIV and BLV test results. Least squares regression was used to investigate potential associations between BIV test results and selected production indices. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|Wow! What a {{difference}} two years makes. At the Range Beef Cow Symposium in 2003, we endeavored {{to address the}} topic âTraceback, Verification, and Animal Identification on the Ranch: Big Brother of Best Buddy?â On the very day of this presentation, December 9, 2005, a Holstein cow {{in the state of}} Washington was harvested and due to abnormalities observed in this cow, tissue samples were taken for further evaluation. Later that month, on December 23, 2003, it was announced that this <b>cow</b> <b>tested</b> positive for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). This event, along with associated policy from USDA, combined to rocket the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) forward. Correspondingly, programs have developed in the beef sector designed to verify, assure, and differentiate animals and products in the marketplace. The {{purpose of this paper is}} not to reiterate all of the ramifications, producer attitudes or consumer feedback on the merits or challenges associated with is topic. Rather, it is our objective to simply âdecodeâ the alphabet soup used in this arena. It is our supposition, that many cattle producers, academics and allied industry folks involved in the business lack understanding of many of the terms, programs, and purposes of certain acronyms that are being freely thrown around today...|$|R
