40|$|Abstract—Simultaneous all-optical {{switching}} of 20 continuouswave wavelength channels {{is achieved}} in a microring resonator-based silicon broadband 1 2 2 <b>comb</b> <b>switch.</b> Moreover, single-channel power penalty measurements are performed during active {{operation of the}} switch at both the through and the drop output ports. A statistical characterization of the drop-port insertion losses and extinction ratios of both ports shows broad spectral uniformity, and bit-error-rate measurements during passive operation indicate a negligible increase in signal degradation {{as the number of}} wavelength channels exiting the drop port are scaled from one to 16, with peak powers of 06 dBm per channel. A high-speed broadband switching device, such as the one described here, is a crucial element for the deployment of interconnection networks based on silicon photonic integrated circuits.

30|$|One {{application}} of the IIR resonator is an all-optical <b>comb</b> <b>switch</b> for multi-wavelength message routing in photonic networks, which is implemented as a ring resonator [22]. Although silicon ring resonators {{and in some cases}} Fabry-Perot (FP) resonators [23], can have high finesse they either require complex structures and metal depositions in highly defined manner or cannot be fabricated in in-fiber applications such as in-fiber modulators since they have to be implemented as part of an SOI chip [24 – 28]. Even though ring resonators can be made in e.g. InP without any silicon/silica and does not require SOI, they will lack the advantages of silicon such as low price, industry oriented and easier integration in silicon based integrated circuits. Indeed, the coated silicon slab can be regarded as not less complicated, however, since it does not require lithography, etching, annealing or any other process, but only deposition of layers it is said to be less complicated. FB resonator can have high finesse with coating or in other ways, such as shown in [8], in which they propose by recording Bragg mirrors {{on both sides of the}} silicon inside a fiber, as discussed in details in the discussion section with a 1  dB insertion loss.|$|E

30|$|Our device has a smooth, rounded {{transmission}} spectrum {{that is the}} result of a single FP resonator, or cavity. However, flat top bandpass filters can be made by stacking multiple cavities together. The stacking of cavities results in the increase of the roll-off slope which in turn improves the out-of-band rejection level. Thus, our device, implemented as a multi-cavities device, can be used as an efficient optical <b>comb</b> <b>switching</b> for multi-wavelength message routing in Si photonics network applications such as CMOS technologies.|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid advance}} of {{technology}} enables {{a large number}} of processing cores to be integrated into a single chip which is called a Chip Multiprocessor (CMP) or a Multiprocessor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) design. The on-chip interconnection network, which is the communication infrastructure for these processing cores, plays a central role in a many-core system. With the continuously increasing complexity of many-core systems, traditional metallic wired electronic networks-on-chip (NoC) became a bottleneck because of the unbearable latency in data transmission and extremely high energy consumption on chip. Optical networks-on-chip (ONoC) has been proposed as a promising alternative paradigm for electronic NoC with the benefits of optical signaling communication such as extremely high bandwidth, negligible latency, and low power consumption. This dissertation focus on the design of high-performance and scalable ONoC architectures and the contributions are highlighted as follow: 1. A micro-ring resonator (MRR) -based Generic Wavelength-routed Optical Router (GWOR) is proposed. A method for developing any sized GWOR is introduced. GWOR is a scalable non-blocking ONoC architecture with simple structure, low cost and high power efficiency compared to existing ONoC designs. 2. To expand the bandwidth and improve the fault tolerance of the GWOR, a redundant GWOR architecture is designed by cascading different type of GWORs into one network. 3. The redundant GWOR built with MRR-based <b>comb</b> <b>switches</b> is proposed. <b>Comb</b> <b>switches</b> can expand the bandwidth while keep the topology of GWOR unchanged by replacing the general MRRs with <b>comb</b> <b>switches.</b> 4. A butterfly fat tree (BFT) -based hybrid optoelectronic NoC (HONoC) architecture is developed in which GWORs are used for global communication and electronic routers are used for local communication. The proposed HONoC uses less numbers of electronic routers and links than its counterpart of electronic BFT-based NoC. It takes the advantages of GWOR in optical communication and BFT in non-uniform traffic communication and three-dimension (3 D) implementation. 5. A cycle-accurate NoC simulator is developed to evaluate the performance of proposed HONoC architectures. It is a comprehensive platform that can simulate both electronic and optical NoCs. Different size HONoC architectures are evaluated in terms of throughput, latency and energy dissipation. Simulation results confirm that HONoC achieves good network performance with lower power consumption...|$|R
50|$|With {{incumbent}} Senator Scott Nein {{unable to}} run for the Senate again because of term limits, Cates, along with Representative Greg Jolivette and County Commissioner Courtney Combs were seen as potential successors. Midway through 2003, the Butler County Republican party sought to create a proposal that would help to avoid a primary. It focused on Jolivette and <b>Combs</b> <b>switching</b> offices, therefore allowing Cates to seal the nomination for the Senate seat. However, this did not work out. Jolivette decided to seek a fourth term in the House, and Combs decided to seek the Senate seat. Cates faced no opposition for his bid. Therefore, he had a clear path to the Senate in a staunchly Republican district. Against Democrat Melvin A. Smith in the general election, Cates won by about 48,000 votes.|$|R
50|$|An {{electromechanical}} cam timer uses a small synchronous AC motor {{turning a}} cam against a <b>comb</b> of <b>switch</b> contacts. The AC motor is turned at an accurate rate by the alternating current, which power companies carefully regulate. Gears drive a shaft at the desired rate, {{and turn the}} cam. The most common application of this timer now is in washers, driers and dishwashers. This type of timer often has a friction clutch between the gear train and the cam, so that the cam can be turned to reset the time.|$|R

40|$|The {{exponential}} growth of converged telecommunication {{services and the}} increasing demands for video rich multimedia applications have triggered the vast development of optical access technology to resolve the capacity bottleneck at metropolitan-access aggregations. To further enhance overall performance, next generation optical access networks will require highly efficient wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology beyond the capability of current standard time division multiplexed (TDM) systems. The successful implementation of future-proof WDM access networks depends on advancements in high performance transmission schemes {{as well as economical}} and practical electronic/photonic devices. This thesis focuses on an investigation of the use of optical frequency comb sources, and spectrally efficient modulation formats, in high capacity WDM based optical access networks. A novel injected gain <b>switched</b> <b>comb</b> generation technique which deliver simplicity, reliability, and cost effectiveness has been proposed and verified through experimental work. In addition, a detailed characterization of the optical comb source has been undertaken with special attention on the phase noise property of the comb lines. The potential of the injected gain <b>switched</b> <b>comb</b> source is then demonstrated in a digital coherent receiver based long reach WDM access scenario, which intends to facilitate 10 - 40 Gbit/s data delivery per channel. Furthermore, an optical scalar transmission scheme enabling the direct detection of higher order modulation format signals has been proposed and experimentally investigated...|$|R
40|$|The chalcogenide glass, Ge 28 Sb 12 Se 60, is a {{promising}} material platform for compact, low-threshold nonlinear optical devices {{operating in the}} near- to mid-infrared. It is particularly attractive given its wide range of transparency, large Kerr coefficient, and relatively weak multi-photon absorption. The nonlinear optical properties of Ge 28 Sb 12 Se 60 were investigated in bulk and waveguide forms, over a range of wavelengths from 1. 0 to 3. 5 μm. From z-scan measurements at 1. 03 µm, using circularly polarized, 200 fs pulses at 374 kHz, bulk Ge 28 Sb 12 Se 60 glass was found to have a nonlinear refractive index ~ 130 times that of fused silica and a two-photon absorption coefficient of 3. 5 cm/GW. Ge-Sb-Se waveguides and microresonators were designed and characterized, laying groundwork for the development of efficient, compact nonlinear devices such as frequency <b>combs</b> and optical <b>switches.</b> In particular, single-mode Ge-Sb-Se strip waveguides, fabricated by photo- or e-beam lithography, followed by thermal evaporation and lift-off, were demonstrated with average propagation losses of 11. 8 dB/cm at 1. 03 µm and 4. 0 - 6. 1 dB/cm at 1. 55 µm. Nonlinear optical waveguides were characterized with measurements of spectral broadening and intensity-dependent transmission, revealing a large measured nonlinear figure of merit of 5. 2 ± 1. 6 at 1. 55 µm. Hybrid chalcogenide-silica wedge microresonators were characterized from 1500 - 1630 nm, with loaded quality factors up to 1. 5 x 105 and thermal resonant shifts ~ 60. 5 pm/˚C. Finally, planar chalcogenide-based ring resonators were designed for operation at 1. 55 and 3. 5 µm, simulating dispersion and optimizing waveguide dimensions for maximum four-wave mixing conversion efficiency. Ring resonators with 6 - and 20 -µm radii were demonstrated with intrinsic quality factors of 1 - 2 x 104 and 8. 3 x 104, respectively...|$|R
