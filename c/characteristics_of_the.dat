Many other paleotologists have classified Ampelosaurus as belonging to Titanosauria, Saltasauridae, and Titanosauridae. Ampelosaurus may have an uncertain classification, but it is clearly a titanosaur, with many features found in titanosaurs.|$|E

30|$|In their {{examination}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antecedents to engagement, Schaufeli and Bakker (2004) {{focused on}} job resources and demands at the task, interpersonal, and organizational level (performance feedback, support from colleagues, and supervisory coaching). Here, we leverage complements to supervisory leadership, focusing on {{feedback from the}} work itself (task <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work), knowledge to work independently (task <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> worker), and alternative workplace use (contextual <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work).
