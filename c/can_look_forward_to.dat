Those individuals with mild symptoms generally do well and live long, productive lives, while individuals with the more severe form may have serious disabilities. However, with appropriate medical care, most individuals with the disorder <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> normal life expectancy.|$|E
25|$|Borussia {{had taken}} steps to improve their {{financial}} situation {{with the construction of}} a new state-of-the-art stadium called Borussia-Park with a permitted capacity of 59,771 spectators (limited to 54,067 for Bundesliga games and to 46,249 for international games). The club had long been hindered by playing in a much smaller and older facility (Bökelberg, capacity 34,500) and with the opening of the new stadium in 2004 <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> increased revenues through higher ticket sales and the ability to host lucrative international matches.|$|E

5000|$|After {{five years}} in India, <b>Canning</b> <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> {{returning}} to England and her family, with the intended departure date planned for January 1862. Back home, Queen Victoria had granted her rangership of Greenwich Park, a posting that <b>Canning</b> <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to.</b> She embarked on one final trip to see the mountains surrounding Darjeeling in October, and continued her trip into the following month by returning to Calcutta. However, Canning became ill during the journey and died at Government House of malaria, in her husband's arms. She was buried {{on the grounds of}} Barrackpore, in a small garden her husband described as a [...] "beautiful spot" [...] that looked upon a river she [...] "was so fond of drawing". News of her demise reached Queen Victoria shortly before the death of her own husband, Prince Albert, in December.|$|R

25|$|Wright however {{does not}} hold the view that good works {{contribute}} to one's salvation but rather that the final judgement is something we <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> as a future vindication of God's present declaration of our righteousness. In other words, our works {{are a result of}} our salvation and the future judgement will show that. Others tend to place a higher value on the importance of good works than the historic Lutheran and Reformed perspectives do, taking the view that they causally contribute to the salvation of the individual.|$|E
500|$|Strauss {{made his}} debut at Dommayer's in October 1844, where he {{performed}} {{some of his}} first works, such as the waltzes [...] "Sinngedichte", Op.1 and [...] "Gunstwerber", Op.4 and the polka [...] "Herzenslust", Op.3. Critics and the press were unanimous in their praise for Strauss's music. A critic for Der Wanderer commented that [...] "Strauss’s name will be worthily continued in his son; children and children’s children <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> the future, and three-quarter time will find a strong footing in him." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{brainstorming}} {{for ideas}} to the game's plot, Sakamoto decided to create an original story instead of remaking a Metroid game because he [...] "always [...] to do something really unprecedented, something people have never played before". He continued, saying, [...] "Many of our designers and creators want to challenge something new rather than simply porting over an old title. That's something I hope we'll always do. If you can challenge something new, you <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> the public response, be it good or bad." [...] The game introduces gameplay mechanics that are new to the Metroid series. Metroid Fusion offers a more direct, almost mission-based structure that supports the player to explore areas. Objectives are also flexible in {{how they can be}} completed, acting [...] "more as a guide for what the player should do instead of giving a completely blank map and saying 'Here you go, {{figure out what to do}} and how to do it.|$|E
60|$|This degrades Jonson into a libeller, {{instead of}} {{justifying}} {{him as a}} dramatic poet. 'Non quod verum est, sed quod verisimile', is the dramatist's rule. At all events, the poet who chooses transitory manners, ought to content himself with transitory praise. If his object be reputation, he ought not to expect fame. The utmost he <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>forwards</b> <b>to,</b> is to be quoted by, and to enliven the writings of, an antiquarian. Pistol, Nym and 'id genus omne', do not please us as characters, but are endured as fantastic creations, foils to the native wit of Falstaff.--I say wit emphatically; for this character so often extolled as the masterpiece of humor, neither contains, nor was meant to contain, any humor at all.|$|R

500|$|The {{television}} {{show that the}} Simpson family watches {{at the beginning of}} the episode, in which the two reviewers discuss the latest McBain film, is a parody of the American television series Siskel & Ebert & the Movies. In the flashback sequence, Homer is seen singing along to the 1973 song [...] "The Joker" [...] by the Steve Miller Band while driving to school. Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin posters hang on the wall of Homer's 1974 bedroom. The 1970 song [...] "(They Long to Be) Close to You" [...] by The Carpenters is heard when Homer sees Marge for the first time. Homer eats a bucket of Shakespeare Fried Chicken when he reveals his feelings towards Marge to Grampa. At the debate, Homer disagrees about the idea of lowering the United States national speed limit to 55mph (90km/h), arguing that [...] "Sure, it'll save a few lives, but millions will be late!" [...] This is a reference to the National Maximum Speed Law provision of the 1974 Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act that prohibited speed limits higher than 55mph. Barney asks a girl named Estelle if she wants to go to the prom with him, but she tells him that she would not go to the prom with him even if he were American actor Elliott Gould. Artie says he can think of a dozen highly cogent arguments to why Marge should accept his prom offer, one of which is from a Time magazine titled [...] "America's Love Affair with the Prom: Even wallflowers <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> one date a year," [...] a reference to the American magazine Time. Songs played in the episode include [...] "The Streak" [...] by Ray Stevens , [...] "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" [...] by Elton John, [...] "Colour My World" [...] by Chicago, [...] "Pick Up the Pieces" [...] by Average White Band, and [...] "The Hustle" [...] by Van McCoy.|$|E
2500|$|Kat was [...] {{written out}} of EastEnders {{temporarily}} in January 2012. The writers for EastEnders organised [...] "emergency script changes" [...] which saw Kat called away {{to care for}} her father Charlie after a stroke. A source said: [...] "It was a very easy decision to make for the show. She is a great actress and extremely popular on set. She'll come back stronger than ever." [...] It was announced shortly after Wallace's break from EastEnders that Sharon Watts, played by Letitia Dean, would return to the series. Numerous tabloids reported that the purpose of Dean's return is to replace Jessie Wallace or to [...] "fill the hole left behind by Wallace". This was later denied by an EastEnders spokesperson. The spokesperson commented: [...] "There is no link between Letitia's return to EastEnders and Jessie not being around at the moment. We have been working on plans to bring Sharon back for quite some time." [...] An insider added: [...] "Jessie and Letitia are two fantastic actresses and their characters are firm favourites with fans. Viewers <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> seeing them back on screen together later this year." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 29 April 2010, Turner's {{decision}} to leave the show was announced after she {{expressed a desire to}} pursue other roles. She said of her departure: [...] "I've had the most fantastic time at EastEnders. Stacey has been such a brilliant role for me to play, as {{has been part of the}} feisty Slater family. I'm so lucky to have had such challenging storylines, from the affair with Max and being diagnosed with bipolar to the complete shock of being revealed as Archie's killer during the live 25th Anniversary episode. I'll miss Stacey and everyone in Albert Square very much but the time has come to try something different." [...] Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood added: [...] "We'll be very sad to see Lacey Turner leave the show. Lacey is one of the best young actresses on TV at the moment and the fact that she's won 28 awards in the last five years is testament to this. It's only right that someone as talented and versatile as Lacey should pursue new challenges and we wish her the very best of luck. In the meantime, viewers <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> a typically dramatic Slater family exit when she leaves and the door will be left open for Stacey Branning to return to Albert Square in the future." [...] During an interview on This Morning, Kirkwood revealed that Stacey will take centre stage at Christmas and will depart in a [...] "dramatic plotline" [...] and said [...] "Christmas will be all about [...] " [...] and explained the storyline would be [...] "a suitably dramatic and fitting departure for one of the all-time greats". Stacey departed on Christmas Day 2010.|$|E

5000|$|Chris Reynolds of Gigwise viewed Sohodolls as [...] "a sleazy yet chic outfit {{comparable}} to Goldfrapp" [...] and wrote that [...] "Maya's vocals are seductive and the bass and synths are {{as smooth as}} can be", but felt that [...] "the lack of variation ... detracts greatest from a fine debut. When stripped down this is simple pop music with an eighties edge and can become tiresome at points such as the lacklustre 'Trash the Rental'." [...] Emily Kate Stephens of MyVillage concluded, [...] "With a huge mix of influences Sohodolls travel through this album with a strength and grace that means you can't help but listen. They <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>forwarded</b> <b>to</b> awakening their followers' senses. From the first listen the album {{makes you want to}} catch their next gig." ...|$|R
50|$|China Tobacco <b>can</b> also <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> an anti-smoking lobby that is {{currently}} small but growing.

6000|$|... "But {{after what}} you told us yesterday, I think, perhaps, that this need not be so; and that {{the way in which}} you were to save the Temple was not the way we thought. Your mission has been fulfilled--not by great victories, which would have made you the hero of Israel--but in that contest in the valley, where no eyes but those of God beheld you; and should the Temple be saved, no one will know that you were its savior, save we who love you.

60|$|And {{that the}} {{contrast}} may be felt in its fullest completeness, {{we must consider}} that no private soldier is tempted into the ranks by hopes of plunder, or driven into them by want of fair wages for fair work,--that no officer <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> the splendid prizes of hereditary wealth and title. Love of their country was the only incentive, its gratitude their only reward. And {{in the matter of}} taxation also, a willingness to help bear the common burden has more of generosity in it where the wealth of the people is in great part the daily result of their daily toil, and not a hoard inherited without merit, as without industry.|$|E

I {{know the difference between}} comfort and discomfort in money matters, but all that is as a feather in the balance. You are my god upon earth, and to you I must cling. Whether you be away from me or with me, I must cling to you the same. If I am to be separated from you for a time, I can do it with hope. If I am to be separated from you for ever, I shall still do so,--with despair. And now I will trust you, and I will do whatever you tell me. If you forbid me to call you mine any longer,--I will obey, and will never reproach you." ...|$|E
