5|$|The University of Toronto has {{traditionally}} been a decentralized institution, with governing authority shared among its <b>central</b> <b>administration,</b> academic faculties and colleges. The Governing Council is the unicameral legislative organ of the <b>central</b> <b>administration,</b> overseeing general academic, business and institutional affairs. Before 1971, the university was governed under a bicameral system composed {{of the board of}} governors and the university senate. The chancellor, usually a former governor general, lieutenant governor, premier or diplomat, is the ceremonial head of the university. The president is appointed by the council as the chief executive.|$|E
5|$|As a collegiate university, Oxford's {{structure}} can {{be confusing}} to those unfamiliar with it. The university is a federation, comprising over forty self-governing colleges and halls, {{along with a}} <b>central</b> <b>administration</b> headed by the Vice-Chancellor.|$|E

5|$|Royal {{officials}} {{were divided into}} three categories; officials attached to the palace, officials of <b>central</b> <b>administration</b> and officials of provincial administration. One {{of the most important}} positions was the purohita, the advisor of the king. The king also had a board of ministers called amati paheja. In <b>central</b> <b>administration,</b> senapati (Commander-in-Chief of the Army) was a position second only to the king, and held by a member of nobility. This position, and also the positions of yuvaraja (sub king), administrative positions in the country's provinces and major ports and provinces, were often held by relatives of the king.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church, {{also known}} as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.29billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest {{religious}} institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history and development of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the Pope, the church's doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. Its <b>central</b> <b>administration,</b> the Holy See, is in the Vatican City, enclaved within Rome, Italy.|$|E
5|$|The post-war era saw the {{creation}} of New College in 1962, Innis College in 1964 and Woodsworth College in 1974, all of them nondenominational. Along with University College, they comprise the university's constituent colleges, which are established and funded by the <b>central</b> <b>administration</b> and are therefore financially dependent. Massey College was established in 1963 by the Massey Foundation as a college exclusively for graduate students. Regis College, a Jesuit seminary, entered federation with the university in 1979.|$|E
5000|$|The President of the <b>Central</b> Tibetan <b>Administration,</b> officially Sikyong ( [...] ; [...] ) is {{the leader}} of the <b>Central</b> Tibetan <b>Administration,</b> a Tibetan exile {{organisation}} also known as the Tibetan government-in-exile. Prior to September, 2012, this office was known as Kalön Tripa, sometimes translated as prime minister. The current Sikyong is Lobsang Sangay. The Sikyong is the head of the Kashag or Cabinet, part of the executive branch of the <b>Central</b> Tibetan <b>Administration.</b> This office should not be confused with the Chairman of the government of the Tibet Autonomous Region.|$|R

5|$|After {{returning}} to Kathmandu, in complicity with Rana Bahadur, Bhimsen indulged in appropriating the palaces and properties of deposed members of Shah family, which he shared {{between himself and}} his supporter Rangnath Paudel. This aroused resentment and jealousy among Sher Bahadur Shah (Rana Bahadur's step brother) and his faction, since they did not receive any portion of this confiscated property, despite their help in reinstating Rana Bahadur to power. They were also wary of Bhimsen's growing power. By this time, Rana Bahadur was a nominal figure and Kaji Bhimsen Thapa was single-handedly controlling the <b>central</b> <b>administration</b> of the country, being able to implement even unpopular reforms like Baisathi Haran.|$|E
5|$|Englewood Place {{was a part}} of Robin Street until {{receiving}} {{its current}} name in the 1870s; it was laid out in lots in 1879, with large mansions and carriage houses built between 1879 and 1887. 5 and 7 Englewood Place were designed by Robert Gibson, who also designed the All Saints Cathedral. 5 Englewood Place became the residence of the University at Albany's president after 1997. Thurlow Terrace was developed a decade after Englewood. 8 Thurlow Terrace was the residence of the Albany Catholic bishops until 1957. From 1958 to 1972 the State University of New York owned 7, 8, 9, and 10 Thurlow Terrace as their <b>central</b> <b>administration,</b> prior to moving to One Commerce Plaza.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{integration}} of southern Vietnam into the <b>central</b> <b>administration,</b> newly appointed imperial officials arrived in Saigon. The new mandarins carried out a detailed inquiry into Duyệt's rule and claimed that widespread corruption and abuse of power took place. Bạch Xuân Nguyên, {{the head of the}} inquiry, called for Duyet's posthumous prosecution, which resulted in 100 lashes being applied to his grave. Many of Duyệt's subordinates were arrested and 16 of his family members were executed. This action prompted the Duyệt's officials—fearful of their positions and security under the central system—to launch a revolt under the leadership of his adopted son Lê Văn Khôi. Historical opinion is divided with scholars contesting whether the humiliation of Duyệt or the loss of southern autonomy was the main catalyst.|$|E

50|$|Governor Edward Rendell {{proposed}} that consolidation with adjacent school districts, in each county, would achieve substantial cost savings. The savings could be redirected to improving lagging reading and science achievement, to enriching the academic programs or to reducing residents' property taxes.

5|$|The Greater London Council was {{abolished}} in 1986, {{which left}} London without a <b>central</b> <b>administration</b> until 2000 when London-wide government was restored, {{with the creation}} of the Greater London Authority. To celebrate the start of the 21st century, the Millennium Dome, London Eye and Millennium Bridge were constructed. On 6 July 2005 London was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics, making London the first city to stage the Olympic Games three times. On 7 July 2005, three London Underground trains and a double-decker bus were bombed in a series of terrorist attacks.|$|E
5|$|After {{students}} {{passed the}} often difficult, bureaucratic, and heavily demanding Imperial Exams, as they became officials, {{they did not}} always {{see eye to eye}} with others that had passed the same examination. Even though they were fully-fledged graduates ready for government service, there was always the factor of competition with other officials. Promotion to a higher post, higher salary, additional honors, and selection for choice assignment responsibilities were often uncertain, as young new officials often needed higher-ranking officials to recommend them for service. Once an official would rise to the upper echelons of <b>central</b> <b>administration</b> based in the capital, they would often compete with others over influence of the emperor's official adoption of state policies. Officials with different opinions on how to approach administrative affairs often sought out other officials for support, leading to pacts of rivaling officials lining up political allies at court to sway the emperor against the faction they disagreed with.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} rising {{importance}} of a <b>central</b> <b>administration</b> arose {{a new class of}} educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration. As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150BC, is assumed to have caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.|$|E

5|$|Stephen {{decided to}} {{recapture}} Chilia (now Kiliya in Ukraine), an important port on the Danube, which {{brought him into}} conflict with Hungary and Wallachia. He besieged the town during the Ottoman invasion of Wallachia in 1462, but was seriously wounded during the siege. Two years later, he captured the town. He promised support to {{the leaders of the}} Three Nations of Transylvania against Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, in 1467. Corvinus invaded Moldavia, but Stephen defeated him in the Battle of Baia. Peter Aaron broke into Moldavia with Hungarian support in December 1470, but was also defeated by Stephen and executed, along with the Moldavian boyars who still endorsed him. Stephen restored old fortresses and erected new ones, which improved Moldavia's defence system as well as strengthened <b>central</b> <b>administration.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Mycenaean economy, {{given its}} pre-monetary nature, {{was focused on}} the {{redistribution}} of goods, commodities and labor by a <b>central</b> <b>administration.</b> The preserved Linear B records in Pylos and Knossos indicate that the palaces were closely monitoring a variety of industries and commodities, the organization of land management and the rations given to the dependent personnel. The Mycenaean palaces maintained extensive control of the nondomestic areas of production through careful control and acquisition and distribution in the palace industries, and the tallying of produced goods. For instance, the Knossos tablets record c. 80,000-100,000 sheep grazing in central Crete, and the quantity of the expected wool from these sheep and their offspring, as well as how this wool was allocated. The archives of Pylos display a specialized workforce, where each worker belonged to a precise category and was assigned to a specific task in the stages of production, notably in textiles.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Empire {{reached its}} {{greatest}} territorial extent {{during the second}} century AD; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories. Economic issues, including inflation, and external pressure on the frontiers combined to create the Crisis of the Third Century, with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers. Military expenses increased steadily during the third century, mainly {{in response to the}} war with the Sasanian Empire, which revived {{in the middle of the}} third century. The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the Roman legion as the main tactical unit. The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns. More bureaucrats were needed in the <b>central</b> <b>administration</b> to deal with the needs of the army, which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers.|$|E

5|$|The <b>central</b> <b>administration</b> at Huế {{was divided}} into six ministries: Public affairs, finance, rites, war, justice and public works. Each was under a minister, {{assisted}} by two deputies {{and two or three}} councillors. Each of these ministries had around 70 employees assigned to various units. The heads of these ministries formed the Supreme Council. A treasurer general and a Chief of the Judicial Service assisted a governor general, {{who was in charge of}} a number of provinces. The provinces were classified into trấn and dinh. These were in turn divided into phủ, huyện and châu. All important matters were examined by the Supreme Council in the presence of Gia Long. The officials tabled their reports for discussion and decision-making. The bureaucrats involved in the Supreme Council were selected from the high-ranking mandarins of the six ministries and the academies.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-one miners {{were killed}} in an {{accident}} in Ny-Ålesund in 1962. The resulting Kings Bay Affair, where unsafe mining had been approved to maintain an increased Norwegian presence on Svalbard, ultimately led to vote of no confidence in Parliament and the withdrawal of Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen's third cabinet. Oil drilling was started by Caltex in 1961. Caltex was granted claims based on indications of oil, rather than samples. Arktikugol was not granted claims based on similar evidence, contributing to tensions with the Soviet Union. Both the Kings Bay Affair and the Caltex Affair initiated public debate about the administration of Svalbard, {{and in particular the}} lack of resources and control of Soviet settlements. Funding for local and <b>central</b> <b>administration</b> was increased heavily, and the Governor increased its activities in Soviet settlements. More than half the archipelago was protected in 1972 through four national parks, fourteen bird sanctuaries and four nature reserves. Store Norske was nationalized between 1973 and 1976.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of May 18, 1833, Duyệt's {{supporters}} {{took control of the}} citadel, executing Nguyên and his subordinates. They then held a torch-lit ceremony at Duyệt's tomb, during which his adopted son Khôi formally rejected the imperial authority of Minh Mang and declared his support for An Hoa, the son of Prince Cảnh. On the same evening, Khoi's men assassinated Nguyen Van Que, the newly appointed Governor-General who was overseeing the integration of the south into the <b>central</b> <b>administration.</b> All of the centrally appointed officials were killed or fled the citadel. Surprise attacks caught the imperial garrisons off guard and within three days, all six southern provinces were in the hands of Khoi's forces. Khoi convinced a French priest named Joseph Marchand to come and stay within the citadel, hoping that his presence would win over support from the local Catholics. Khoi's support of An Hoa was also calculated to gain Catholic support, because Canh had converted to Catholicism. He further called on Catholics to congregate in the citadel under his protection. Vietnamese priests went on to lead Catholic armies in fighting off imperial forces as well providing messengers to communicate with the world outside their besieged citadel.|$|E
