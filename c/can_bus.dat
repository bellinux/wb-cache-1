25|$|The E46 {{electronics}} {{are more}} integrated than previous generations of 3 Series, {{including the use}} of a <b>CAN</b> <b>bus</b> system. Drivetrain information (such as engine, transmission and stability control) is communicated using the <b>CAN</b> <b>bus.</b> Vehicle electronics (such as the radio, navigation, television and telecommunications) can communicate to each other via the K-bus.|$|E
25|$|The vehicle {{responds}} to the PID query on the <b>CAN</b> <b>bus</b> with message IDs that depend on which module responded. Typically the engine or main ECU responds at ID 7E8h. Other modules, like the hybrid controller or battery controller in a Prius, respond at 07E9h, 07EAh, 07EBh, etc. These are 8h higher than the physical address the module {{responds to}}. Even though the number of bytes in the returned value is variable, the message uses 8 data bytes regardless (<b>CAN</b> <b>bus</b> protocol form Frameformat with 8 data bytes).|$|E

25|$|<b>CAN</b> <b>bus</b> {{may also}} be used for {{communication}} beyond the standard OBD messages. Physical addressing uses particular CAN IDs for specific modules (e.g., 720h for the instrument cluster in Fords) with proprietary frame payloads.|$|E
25|$|Another fully {{autonomous}} tractor technology involves {{using the}} native electrical (or <b>CAN</b> <b>bus)</b> {{system of the}} tractor or farm equipment to send commands. Using GPS positioning and radio feedback, automation software manages the vehicle's path and controls farming implements. A retrofit radio receiver and on-board computer are generally used to receive commands from the remote command station and translate it into vehicle commands such as steering, acceleration, braking, transmission, and implement control. Sensor technologies such as lidar improve safety by detecting and reacting to unforeseen obstacles.|$|E
25|$|The PID query and {{response}} occurs on the vehicle's <b>CAN</b> <b>bus.</b> Standard OBD requests {{and response}}s use functional addresses. The diagnostic reader initiates a query using CAN ID 7DFh, which {{acts as a}} broadcast address, and accepts responses from any ID in the range 7E8h to 7EFh. ECUs that can respond to OBD queries listen both to the functional broadcast ID of 7DFh and one assigned ID in the range 7E0h to 7E7h. Their response has an ID of their assigned ID plus 8 e.g. 7E8h through 7EFh.|$|E

During {{construction of the}} Mandurah line, the freeway-level bus platforms were removed and converted to rail platforms. To {{make room for the}} rail corridor, the 120 metre long, 1,800 tonne <b>Canning</b> Highway <b>bus</b> bridge was moved 9.5 metres southwest by pulling the bridge sideways over teflon mats. This was a more economical alternative to constructing a completely new bridge. The move did not disrupt ongoing traffic on the Kwinana Freeway.|$|R
