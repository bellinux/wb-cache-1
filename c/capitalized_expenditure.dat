40|$|Numerous {{empirical}} studies provide {{evidence on the}} value relevance of <b>capitalizing</b> <b>expenditures</b> on intangibles such as research & development (Lev and Sougiannis 1996, Hand 2003). However, accounting standards in many countries, such as the U. S. or Germany, prohibit capitalizing these. In this paper, we analyze {{the role of the}} capitalization of RND in the process of providing value relevant information. Several studies show that accrual information has superior predictive ability compared to cash flows (Wilson 1986, Dechow 1994). Reporting RND on the balance sheet leads to an additional accrual component of earnings which in turn serves as a conveyor of additional information. Within the framework of Dechow (1994) we analyze a sample of the 152 largest German listed companies over a period of five years (2002 - 2006). Our results show an added value of the accrual information provided by capitalized RND, in accordance with the literature surrounding the idea that accrual information is superior to cash information. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{decision}} of firms to expense or <b>capitalize</b> R&D <b>expenditures.</b> The firm has an incentive to mismatch the benefits and costs of R&D, expensing a larger portion of R&D when the benefits occur in the long-run and capitalizing a larger portion when the benefits occur in the short-run. There is strategic substitutability between R&D investments and expensing. Accounting standards, market evaluation of capitalization, and firms’ accounting policies can have real effects on innovation. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{the result}} of the {{adoption}} of Accounting Standards for Business Enterprise (2006) in the beginning of 2007, the accounting treatment of Research and Development (R&D) expenditure changed dramatically. IT (Information Technology) industry, an R&D intensive industry, was expected to experience more significant change than average. Meanwhile, the financial market in China was increasing mature and investors were becoming more sophisticated. These conditions provide a meaningful ground to investigate the value relevance of R&D reporting based on data of listed IT firms. The work observed all IT firms listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange over the period of 2009 to 2015. In this study, I find evidence supporting the implementation of accounting reforms on R&D increases the value relevance of financial reports. In addition, I also find positive (negative) association between the market value and R&D asset (expense). This study extends the existing studies regarding the effect of R&D reporting reform by using ‘AS-IF’ method. Besides, it collaborates with existing argument that valuation effect of <b>capitalized</b> R&D <b>expenditure</b> is distinct from that of expensed <b>capitalized</b> R&D <b>expenditure.</b> The existence of difference of valuation effect between GEM and Other Boards (Main Board and SME Board) is examined as well, while the study fails to find evidences supporting such difference...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine whether}} managers' {{decisions}} to capitalize or expense R&D expenditures convey {{information about the}} future performance of the firm. Focusing on a French setting where managers can choose to <b>capitalize</b> R&D <b>expenditures</b> under certain circumstances, we find that, after controlling for industry effects, firms that <b>capitalize</b> R&D <b>expenditures</b> spend less on R&D, have more volatile R&D efforts, and are smaller and more leveraged than firms that expense R&D expenditures. We also find that capitalizers capitalize R&D outlays {{when they need to}} meet or beat thresholds. Finally, we show that the decision to capitalize R&D is generally associated with a negative or neutral impact on future performance, even after controlling for self-selection. Our results also show that when firms both capitalize and expense R&D expenditures, the expensed portion exhibits a stronger (and negative) relationship with future performance. Market-based tests corroborate these findings. While we cannot unambiguously establish whether our findings imply that management uses R&D capitalization to manage earnings or because it is unable to estimate the earning power of R&D projects, our results suggest that management is unable to truthfully convey information about future performance through its decision to capitalize R&D. Our findings, based on real data as opposed to simulated data, therefore contrast with previous supportive evidence in favor of capitalization in the literature. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the economic impact}} of a Bayesian network model designed to predict clinical success of a new chemical entity (NCE) based on pre-phase III data. MethodsWe trained our Bayesian network model on publicly accessible data on 503 NCEs, stratified by therapeutic class. We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of our model on an independent data set of 18 NCE-indication pairs, using prior probability data for the antineoplastic NCEs within the training set. We performed Monte Carlo simulations to {{evaluate the}} economic performance of our model relative to reported pharmaceutical industry performance, taking into account reported capitalized phase costs, cumulative revenues for a postapproval period of 7 years, and the range of possible false negative and true negative rates for terminated NCEs within the pharmaceutical industry. ResultsOur model predicted outcomes on the independent validation set of oncology agents with 78 % accuracy (80 %sensitivity and 76 % specificity). In comparison with the pharmaceutical industry's reported success rates, on average our model significantly reduced <b>capitalized</b> <b>expenditures</b> from $ 727 million/successful NCE to $ 444 million/successful NCE (P < 0. 001), and significantly improved revenues from $ 347 million/phase III trial to $ 507 million/phase III trial (P < 0. 001) during the first 7 years post launch. These results indicate that our model identified successful NCEs more efficiently than currently reported pharmaceutical industry performances. ConclusionAccurate prediction of NCE outcomes is computationally feasible, significantly increasing the proportion of successful NCEs, and likely eliminating ineffective and unsafe NCEs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} and value relevance {{implications of the}} accounting method choice for development expenditures for firms with research and development (R&D) programs in the United Kingdom (UK). Using a sample of 3, 229 UK firm-year observations over the period 1996 - 2004, I find {{that the decision to}} expense versus <b>capitalize</b> development <b>expenditures</b> is influenced by earnings variability, earnings sign, firm size, R&D intensity, leverage, steady-state status of the firm's R&D program, and R&D program success. Additional results indicate that there is little difference in value relevance between reported and adjusted numbers for both the Expensers and the Capitalizers. The evidence in this paper suggests that managers choose the 'correct' method for accounting for R&D in order to best communicate the private information which they hold.

40|$|It is {{a widely}} {{accepted}} general principle that a taxpayer should <b>capitalize</b> an <b>expenditure</b> that produces a benefit lasting beyond the current tax period. Yet rules putting this principle into practice {{are among the most}} controversial in all of federal income taxation. Many argue that a retreat from the general principle is warranted when designing capitalization rules, and even those who argue that capitalization rules ought to be sweeping usually conclude that exceptions are necessary or desirable. For instance, most commentators accept uncritically that expenses incurred to procure certain intangible capital should be expensed, as under current law, without exploring whether expensing of intangibles costs is inevitable, although some have considered the implications of excepting intangibles costs from capitalization. Although the arguments with respect to exceptions to capitalization for tangible assets have received more attention, no consensus view has emerged regarding whether many of the exceptions are desirable as a matter of policy.

40|$|In {{this study}} I explore how {{accounting}} choice affects earnings {{quality in the}} software development industry. SFAS No. 86, which requires capitalization of software development costs (SDC), is the only exception in the US to SFAS No. 2, which requires immediate expensing of all research and development (R&D) expenditures. Aboody and Lev (1998) suggest that capitalized SDC are value-relevant. Thus, expensing of these costs might introduce noise into earnings. However, {{it has been suggested}} that future benefits associated with SDC are highly uncertain (Software Publishers Association). Consequently, capitalization might introduce noise into earnings by <b>capitalizing</b> unproductive <b>expenditures.</b> Hence, it is not clear how managers' choice between capitalization and expensing will affect earnings quality. I first find that there is a decline in the quality of earnings in the software industry after the adoption of SFAS No. 86, whereas no such decline is observed in other high-tech industries. Second, I find that, within the software industry, the quality of earnings for expensers is greater than for capitalizers. Finally, I find that, among the capitalizers, those with a large increase in software capital have lower earnings quality than others. Overall, the results suggest that capitalization of software costs does not improve earnings quality. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether {{the use of}} a high quality auditor and increased regulatory monitoring of R&D reporting influence both the level of R&D <b>expenditure</b> <b>capitalized</b> by Australian companies from 1992 to 2002 and the market’s perception of the reliability of these figures. The results indicate that firms with a higher quality auditor capitalize lower levels of R&D costs and that in the period following increased regulatory monitoring, firms capitalize fewer R&D costs. Analysis of the value relevance of R&D expenditure indicates that the market positively values R&D costs when expensed as incurred. These results are consistent using both price and returns models. Results are less persistent for capitalized R&D amounts. The finding from the returns model indicates that the quality of the auditor appears to enhance the reliability of capitalized R&D costs while the price model suggests that the cumulative R&D asset is less relevant in the period following ASC monitoring...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the interactions between}} a firm’s information disclosure decision and three markets: the product market, the takeover market, and the labor market, and the impact on firms’ real decisions. Chapter 1 provides an introduction and overview of this thesis. Chapter 2 considers a product-market competition setting through which to examine firms’ investments in explorative initiatives and their choices of capitalization method regarding exploration related expenditures. The capitalization of exploration expenditures may contain information on whether a firm’s exploration investment is successful, which may then incur imitative behavior from competitors (the information spillover effect), or intimidate competitors from investing (the pre-empting effect). These two effects are driving forces that induce firms to choose different capitalization methods. I find that if regulators require firms to <b>capitalize</b> only <b>expenditures</b> of successful explorations, firms may increase innovation. This study sheds light on the real effect that recognition of exploratory success has on firms’ exploration investments. Chapter 3 considers a setup in which the takeover market plays a disciplinary role in replacing an inefficient incumbent manager to increase firm value. We show that increasing the information quality improves takeover efficiency, but more precise information induces frequent managerial turnover and discourages the manager from working hard. We find that a perfectly informative accounting system is never optimal. Moreover, current shareholders prefer even higher information quality {{in the presence of}} antitakeover laws or provisions, since in such cases, motivating a raider to bid is particularly important for current shareholders. Chapter 4 examines shareholder decisions on innovative investments and information quality in the presence of managerial career concerns. Managers’ reputation concerns are costly to shareholders because managers must be compensated for taking career risks. I show that shareholders face a tradeoff when determining the information quality: lowering the information quality can mitigate a manager’s career risk; however, it also hinders motivating managerial effort. I find that for higher managerial career concerns, shareholders with intense innovation urgency invest more in innovation and lower the information quality to protect the manager from exposure. In contrast, shareholders with lower levels of innovation urgency invest less to mitigate managerial career risk while increasing the compensation incentive to motivate higher managerial effort. My results shed light on the effects of career concerns on innovative investment, disclosure policy, and compensation incentives...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the impact of capitalization of research and development on the valuation of equities for listed firms in South Africa. Design/methodology/approach: 15 years of financial data (2000 to 2014) was collected, and portfolios with similar price-to-book and market size ratios were formed to find any evidence of any post-investment excess returns and the association to the level of research and development investment. Portfolios were re-formed and annually ranked by their research and development intensity relative to sales. In addition, we looked at the changes in excess returns after adjusting the book value as a result of <b>capitalizing</b> R&D <b>expenditure,</b> to see if the distortion imposed by expensing R&D contributed to the under-valuation of firms that invest in R&D. Findings: The results indicate that firms that invest in research and development are systematically under-valued. We found no evidence of any positive association between the returns and investment levels, but rather found evidence of the glamour stock phenomenon in highly intensive research and development firms. Research limitations/implications: The sample data is limited to listed firms in South Africa, and for firms with intermittently omitted R&D on their financial report, we have assumed that such expenditure is zero for the non-disclosed period for the purpose of capitalization and amortisation. Listed firms whose main focus is on building intangible assets, are relatively few, hence our research is descriptive in nature. Practical implications: This paper highlights the commercial significance of valuing the long-term benefits of research and development. Capitalizing the development phase as afforded by the IASB lacks standardization, and as such, inconsistencies arise in the earnings reflected on companies’ financial statements. For investors though, highly intensive R&D firms should be avoided as these earn negative returns. Originality/value: The authors are not aware of any studies showing the effect of accounting rules on research and development that have been conducted in South Africa, or any research that have shown the glamour stock phenomena when investigating the impact of capitalization of research and development. Thus our contribution was to provide evidence on the valuation of stocks for listed firms that report research and development in South Africa that may be a result of the accounting rules. There is limited research on the on the accounting treatment of research and development in emerging markets, whose stock exchanges have been shown to not be highly correlated with the more developed markets, hence enables investors to diversify risk. This should motivate both managers and investors to venture beyond what the conservative accounting treatment of R&D has possibly instigated when valuing stocks...|$|R
40|$|The {{expansion}} of state-mandated {{tests in the}} 1990 s and the testing requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act have supplied researchers {{with an abundance of}} data on test scores that can be used as measures of school quality. This paper uses the state-mandated test scores for 5 th grade and 11 th grade in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, to examine three issues about the capitalization of school quality into house prices: (1) At what level do prospective home buyers evaluate the quality of local public education—at the district level or the level of the neighborhood school? (2) After accounting for student achievement as reflected in test scores, are other aspects of the local public school system, such as class size or <b>expenditures,</b> <b>capitalized</b> into the value of a house? (3) Are the positive results we get for the capitalization of school quality into house prices due simply to the correlation between high test scores and other desirable neighborhood characteristics? The results of our investigation suggest that to home buyers some test-score averages are significantly better indicators {{of the quality of the}} local public school system than others. In particular, home buyers seem to evaluate the quality of public education at the district level rather than at the level of the local school. Class size at the high-school level has some independent effect on house prices, but not class size at the elementary school level. And once we account for student achievement, expenditures per pupil have no further effect on house prices. Finally, restricting our sample to similar neighborhoods along school district boundaries confirms our earlier results for high school test scores but not for elementary school scores.

40|$|Theoretical thesis. Includes bibliographical references. Chapter Ome. Overview of {{the thesis}} [...] Chapter Two. Australian {{evidence}} on the accuracy of analysts' expectations : the value of consensus and timeliness prior to the earnings announcement [...] Chapter Three. Exploration intensity : analysts' private information development and their forecast performance [...] Chapter Four. Exploration intensity and analyst forecast bias [...] Chapter Five. Conclusions. Analysts’ earnings forecasts have long been recognized as proxies for market expectations of future earnings {{because they are more}} accurate and have a stronger association with excess returns on the date of the earnings announcement than time-series models of earnings (Brown and Rozeff, 1978; Bradshaw et al., 2012). A large literature establishes the important role of analysts’ forecasts. For example, Kothari (2001) suggests that “almost all models of valuation either directly or indirectly use earnings forecasts” (p. 144). The predictability of share returns is also associated with the properties of analysts’ forecasts (Frankel and Lee, 1998; Jorgensen et al., 2012). Australian research has increasingly used analysts’ forecasts as proxies for expected earnings (Brown et al., 1999; Jackson, 2005; Beekes and Brown, 2006). While extensive research on analysts’ forecasts focuses largely on the U. S. market, few studies relate to analysts’ forecasts using Australian data. Motivated by the distinctiveness of the Australian setting with continuous disclosure to the stock market, and the prominence of the resources sector in the Australian economy, this thesis examines the properties of analysts’ forecasts in Australia. The aims and objectives of the thesis are addressed in three papers, that is, a comparison of the relative accuracy of alternative earnings forecast measures, and the impact of the intensity of exploration and evaluation (E&E) activities on analysts’ private information acquisition, forecast accuracy and bias in the extractive industry setting. Specifically, the first paper (in Chapter Two) compares the relative accuracy of the consensus forecast against the most recent forecast in the month before the earnings announcement. It investigates how the number of analysts following a company and the timeliness of an individual analyst’s forecast impacts on the differential accuracy of the consensus and the most recent forecast in Australia. The results suggest that, whilst in the late 1980 s {{there is some evidence that}} the most recent forecast is more accurate than the consensus, since the early 1990 s the accuracy of the consensus forecast has consistently outperformed the most recent forecast. The forecasting superiority of the consensus forecast can be attributed to the aggregation value of the consensus outweighing the small timing advantage of the most recent forecast over the short forecast horizon examined in this study. The second paper (in Chapter Three) examines whether analysts in the extractive industries adjust their private information development activities in response to the complexity of information about E&E activities. The results suggest that both the proportion of private information in their forecasts and the accuracy of their forecasts increase with the intensity of E&E activities. Additional analyses reveal that this effect is more pronounced for firms with substantial E&E activities but limited production activities, and that analysts’ private information development activities are mainly related to the <b>capitalized</b> E&E <b>expenditure.</b> The third paper (in Chapter Four) investigates whether the nature and extent of the uncertainty associated with E&E expenditure is a potential determinant of biases in analysts’ forecasts, and also investigates an inter-temporal pattern of analysts’ forecasts for firms with substantial E&E activities. The study finds that pessimism in analysts’ forecasts increases with the intensity of E&E activities, suggesting that the effect of analysts biasing their forecasts to gain information access from managers is more pronounced for firms with higher levels of E&E expenditure. Moreover, analysts are more likely to follow a pessimistic-to-pessimistic pattern in response to greater exploration intensity, consistent with analysts’ strategic use of pessimistic biases to increase their forecast error consistency.
