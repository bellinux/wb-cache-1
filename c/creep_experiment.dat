First, fit thecreep data with a model that has closed form solutions in both compliance and relaxation; for example the Maxwell-Kelvin model(eq. 7.18-7.19) in or the Standard Solid Model (eq. 7.20-7.21) in (section 7.1.3). Oncethe parameters of the creep model are known, produce relaxation pseudo-data with the conjugate relaxation model for the sametimes of the original data. Finally, fit the pseudo data with the Prony series.|$|E

The experimental data consists {{of a series of}} creep diagrams for various applied stresses and temperatures, {{as well as of the}} tentative values of the failure time.

Prevention of the creep failure for constructions exploited for a long time at extreme temperature and loading conditions is one of the actual problems of the fracture mechanics.

In this article, hardness is adopted to indicate this effect.

During a <b>creep</b> <b>experiment,</b> with traction method, the specimens have different time of rupture (130 seconds, 159 seconds, 539 seconds [...] .). The acoustic activity during the test involves three phases (phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3). When we apply our normalization method (cumulative acoustic emission vs. time), we can notice that all tests look very similar, and we can see that there is a proportionality relation between the transition time t_m (phase 1 -> phase 2) and the time of rupture t_r. The technique works significantly better than other recent works. To validate this technique we have achieved a K-cross validation, on 7 specimens. The proportionality between t_m and t_r of the 7 -cross validations had a mean value of 0. 1218 and a standard deviation of 0. 0018. The mean errors that we got is about 8. 58...|$|E

Thanks to the columnar microstructure, discrimination of the nucleus {{can be done}} without ambiguity comparing pre- and post- deformation texture. In-situ DIC analyses are performed around a triple junction were nucleation occurred to follow strain field evolution. Strain field evolution appears strongly linked to nucleation mechanisms, local grain boundary migration and sub-grain boundary formation such as tilt sub-grain boundaries and kink bands. Nucleation processes are correlated with strong strain heterogeneities well characterized by the principal strains evaluated by DIC. It was possible to follow nucleus growth through the evolution of strain localization along the new grain boundaries. Kink bands act as a buffer zone close to the triple junction and accommodate shear parallel to the c-axis. The local strain field appears to be efficiently redistributed by recrystallization processes which create a new microstructure more compatible with the local stresses...|$|E

40|$|The {{long time}} {{relaxation}} behavior of linear and long chain branched (LCB) metallocene polyethylene (mPE) {{is very important}} for understanding their flow properties. One linear and four LCB mPEs were studied in shear creep and recovery measurements. All the mPEs have similar molecular weight and molecular weight distribution but different levels of long chain branching. A technique was developed to eliminate the effect of non-ideal start-up at the beginning of <b>creep</b> <b>experiment</b> and the small residual stress that exists during the creep recovery period. It is found that the existence of long chain branching is responsible for the increasing of the zero shear viscosity, the steady state compliance and the longest relaxation time.

Both are in very good agreement. These observations are compared with the molecular dynamics theory...|$|E

In situ {{measurements of the}} Acoustic Emission (AE) generated by the created damage and the non linear acoustic vibration of the samples are performed. Concerning <b>creep</b> <b>experiment,</b> recorded strain and AE rates exhibit both a power-law acceleration before global failure. We discover a correlation between {{the duration of the}} primary creep, AE activity and the time to failure of the samples. This suggests a method for predicting the time to failure based on the early time recording of the strain rate or AE rate. During three points bending tests when gradual damage is introduced in the material, acoustic emission in terms of released energy is strongly correlated to the nonlinear ultrasonic resonant behaviour induced by damage. Frequency drop and relaxation time are revealed to change as the logarithm of the acoustic emission energy. These results offer new perspectives in the field of the ultrasonic non-destructive evaluation of damage and remaining life-time assessment using in situ ultrasonic transducers...|$|E
