5|$|Loyal to {{the concept}} of the British Empire, Bruce envisaged {{strengthening}} it through mutual economic development, greater political cooperation, and common policies on defence, trade and foreign affairs. His first trip abroad as prime minister was for the 1923 Imperial Conference in London. Bruce put forward a wide range of proposals for stronger cooperation between Great Britain and her dominions {{in a wide range of}} areas, particularly in the areas of trade, defence and the formulation of a <b>common</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> He particularly desired a greater role for the dominions in imperial affairs, including a collective decision-making body for common questions of defence and foreign affairs. He took exception to a lack of involvement in foreign policy decisions made by Britain that would have significant ramifications for Australia. In 1922, in what became known as the Chanak Crisis, British brinkmanship over Turkey's aggressive manoeuvres to redefine its border with Greece had escalated to the point where the British cabinet had threatened war against Turkey. This threat included military participation of dominions in an intervention, though no dominion government had been informed of the developments in Turkey. Although a diplomatic end to the crisis was eventually found, dominion leaders were angered at having almost been committed to a military conflict without any consultation.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} led {{to civil}} war (the Wars of Kappel) and separate alliances with foreign powers by the Catholic and Protestant factions, but the confederacy {{as a whole}} continued to exist. A <b>common</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> was blocked, however, by the impasse. During the Thirty Years' War, religious disagreements among the cantons kept the confederacy neutral and spared it from belligerents. At the Peace of Westphalia, the Swiss delegation was granted formal recognition of the confederacy as a state independent of the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E
25|$|The Protestant Reformation in Switzerland was {{promoted}} initially by Huldrych Zwingli, who gained {{the support of}} the magistrate (Mark Reust) and population of Zürich in the 1520s. It led to significant changes in civil life and state matters in Zürich and spread to several other cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy. Seven cantons remained Roman Catholic, though, which led to inter-cantonal wars known as the Wars of Kappel. After the victory of the Catholic cantons in 1531, they proceeded to institute counter-reformatory policies in some regions. The schism and distrust between Catholic and Protestant cantons would define their interior politics and paralyse any <b>common</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> until well into the 18th century.|$|E

25|$|<b>Foreign</b> <b>policy</b> {{co-operation}} between {{member states}} {{dates from the}} establishment of the Community in 1957, when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the common commercial policy. Steps for a more wide-ranging co-ordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of European Political Cooperation which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming <b>common</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policies.</b> It was not, however, until 1987 when European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the Single European Act.

40|$|Since its {{foundation}} in 1993, the <b>common</b> <b>foreign</b> and security <b>policy</b> of the European Union has undergone many changes {{aimed at improving}} its strength and efficiency. The Lisbon Treaty brought the most significant changes so far, transforming its institutional character {{as well as its}} functioning. The goal of this thesis is to introduce to the reader the changes to the <b>common</b> <b>foreign</b> and security <b>policy</b> brought by the Lisbon Treaty. However, our aim is not only to describe what individual provisions of the Lisbon Treaty mean for this policy area but also to focus on their real impact on the functioning of the <b>common</b> <b>foreign</b> and security <b>policy</b> and the strength of the European Union at international level. The thesis also focuses on the main shortcomings that the <b>common</b> <b>foreign</b> and security <b>policy</b> had to face in the past. It then tries to answer the question, whether the Lisbon Treaty removes these shortcomings and indeed increases the strength and efficiency of the <b>common</b> <b>foreign</b> and security <b>policy</b> of the European Union...|$|R
