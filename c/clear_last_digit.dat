2500|$|A [...] "bad roll" [...] {{occurred}} if {{the total}} showing on the dice did not correspond with {{any combination of}} the digits still in play. A contestant making a bad roll immediately lost the game unless he/she had an insurance marker (see below). A contestant <b>clearing</b> the <b>last</b> <b>digit</b> from the board won the game. The winner of each game received any prizes that were banked, or $100 if no prizes had been banked. The first contestant to win two games won the match and advanced to the Big Numbers bonus round.|$|R

5000|$|... 4 This Way! {{ended in}} 2007. It was a pick-4 game; however, players won by {{matching}} the <b>last</b> <b>digit.</b> Prizes ranged from $1 for the <b>last</b> <b>digit</b> to $4,000 for matching all four.|$|R
50|$|To {{calculate}} the checksum, multiply the individual digits in the identity number and 212121-212. The resulting products (a two digit product, such as 16, would {{be converted to}} 1 + 6) are added together. The checksum is the <b>last</b> <b>digit</b> of 10 minus the <b>last</b> <b>digit</b> in this sum (note that if the <b>last</b> <b>digit</b> of the sum is zero, the checksum is 0). For further details, see Luhn algorithm.|$|R
5000|$|A number (i.e., integer) {{expressed}} in the decimal numeral system is even or odd according to whether its <b>last</b> <b>digit</b> is even or odd.That is, if the <b>last</b> <b>digit</b> is 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9, then it is odd; otherwise it is even. The same idea will work using any even base.In particular, a number {{expressed in}} the binary numeral system is odd if its <b>last</b> <b>digit</b> is 1 and even if its <b>last</b> <b>digit</b> is 0.In an odd base, the number is even according to {{the sum of its}} digits [...] - [...] it is even if and only if the sum of its digits is even.|$|R
5000|$|The {{method for}} general {{multiplication}} {{is a method}} to achieve multiplications [...] with low space complexity, i.e. as few temporary results as possible {{to be kept in}} memory.This is achieved by noting that the final digit is completely determined by multiplying the <b>last</b> <b>digit</b> of the multiplicands. This is held as a temporary result. To find the next to <b>last</b> <b>digit,</b> we need everything that influences this digit: The temporary result, the <b>last</b> <b>digit</b> of [...] times the next-to-last digit of , as well as the next-to-last digit of [...] times the <b>last</b> <b>digit</b> of [...] This calculation is performed, and we have a temporary result that is correct in the final two digits.|$|R
