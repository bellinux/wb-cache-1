50|$|Stamps {{owned by}} {{commercial}} entities have sometimes privately overprinted {{the backs of}} their purchased stamps.

50|$|Private overprints {{have been}} used for a number of reasons.

However, while in Great Britain privately overprinted stamps usually served as receipts for tax payments, in 1859, upon application of the Oxford Union Society, there was a unique instance of a private overprint being approved for application on the face of stamps.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{two problems}} related to 3 D camera calibration using a single mono-plane calibration target with circular control marks. The first problem is how to compute accurately {{the locations of the}} features (ellipses) in images of the target. Since the structure of the control marks is known beforehand, we propose to use a shape-specific searching technique to find the optimal locations of the features. Our experiments have shown this technique generates more accurate feature locations than the state-of-the-art ellipse extraction methods. The second problem is how to refine the <b>control</b> <b>mark</b> locations with unknown manufacturing errors. We demonstrate in a case study, where the control marks are laser printed on a A 4 paper, that the manufacturing errors of the control marks can be compensated to a good extent so that the remaining calibration errors are reduced significantly. 1...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{titanium}} dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2 NPs) have been ingredients {{in everything from}} paints to cosmetics, and even in some kinds of food. This growth in use {{has resulted in a}} substantial increase in the amount of titanium released into the environment, which could have detrimental effects on nearby plant and animal life. Currently, the number of studies conducted on the effects of TiO 2 NPs is quite small, {{especially when it comes to}} edible crops. Because of this lack of research data, this study has been designed to assess the effect of TiO 2 NPs exposure on growth and physiology of Medicago truncatula. This plant was chosen because each species has a unique reaction to nanoparticles, and it also an important feed crop for the cattle industry. The plants were grown in Turface MVP® soil that had been treated with 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 parts per million of TiO 2 NPs for two weeks and then examined for changes in biomass, metal ion concentrations, and gene expression related to antioxidant and photosynthesis. The results varied between the different experiments, but in general the dry weight showed a decrease in mass from the control to the treated soils. The metal nutrients estimation, which recorded a spike in titanium content in the 500 and 1000 PPM samples, showed a correlation between the titanium and important building blocks such as phosphorus, and a majority of the genes tested showed a spike in shoot expression at 250 PPM relative to <b>control</b> <b>mark</b> followed by a decline with the other samples. Altogether, it appears that TiO 2 NPs adversely affect the growth of Medicago at high concentration exposure...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{existing}} survey control infrastructure is paramount {{to the work}} carried out by surveyors when undertaking many projects. Due to the limited availability {{of existing}} survey control infrastructure throughout regional Australia; surveyors require a means to obtain coordinates in the relevant national datum. The method routinely used by surveyors in Australia involves recording GNSS observations and submitting these observations to a free online service GNSS postprocessing service run by Geoscience Australia- AUSPOS. The accuracy of AUSPOS has been investigated through {{a limited number of}} research papers. This project investigates the performance of AUSPOS and other on-line GNSS post-processing services that are available internationally: CSRS-PPP, SCOUT, AUTO GIPSY and OPUS. The performance of the services is investigated in two different respects. Firstly a comparison of the on-line postprocessing services by analysis of the results obtained from each service from identical input data. Secondly, the post processing services are also evaluated in terms of the positional accuracy expected when using any of the on-line GPS services, in relation to existing survey control infrastructure. It was found that the differences between the services AUSPOS, SCOUT and CSRS-PPP are negligible when compared to the residual difference to a known survey <b>control</b> <b>mark.</b> Trends in the consistency of the processed coordinates showed that baseline processing services were marginally more accurate than the PPP processing services, although the inconsistent results of GIPSY may have contributed to this trend. It was found that the accuracy of the processed solutions of each of the services did not significantly improve with observations longer than 4 hours. The accuracy of coordinates in relation to existing control marks is found to be in the order of 2 - 3 cm in the horizontal component and 100 - 150 mm in the vertical component. ...|$|E
40|$|In his ‘Postcript on the Societies of Control’, Gilles Deleuze diagnoses a new mode {{of control}} that pervades {{contemporary}} societies, surpassing the societies of enclosure and discipline so rigorously explored by Foucault. According to Deleuze, the old disciplinary paradigms {{are in the}} process of breaking down – or at least are undergoing a fundamental transformation: the control of individuals is no longer confined to the walls of the prison, school, factory or hospital, but rather spills out into other social spaces, functioning now as a free-floating, modulated form of surveillance made possible through the most sophisticated technologies. Little escapes its grasp, and yet this is a control which presupposes a certain freedom of movement and choices, thus immersing itself within the very fabric of ‘liberal’ societies. My purpose here is to explore the political implications of this new technology of control. The emergence of the control society is something that is coextensive with, I would suggest, the paradigm of bio-politics, as well as the global hegemony of neo-liberal capitalism. Moreover, techniques and practices of control have been intensified and given greater ideological consistency through the so-called ‘war on terrorism’ whose dark potentialities we have seen unfolding over recent years. However, we could equally say that such developments have themselves been made possible through the diverse techniques, practices and technologies of control – technologies which have placed themselves in the service of both capitalism and the state. In any case, I will argue that societies of <b>control</b> <b>mark</b> a certain transformation in politics, coinciding with, as Jacques Rancière would say, the age of postpolitics, where a dull, media-managed and technocratic consensus seems to have replaced the ideological conflicts of the past, and where the line between public and private domains becomes indiscernible. However, the reign of post-politics and the society of control does not mean the end of politics, only its reconfiguration. The central question, then, is what new forms of politics can take place in societies of control – and, in particular, what new forms of politics are needed to resist them. I will suggest here that a different ‘micropolitics’ is called for, one that is no longer organised around the themes of identity and difference, but rather around anonymity and ‘dis-identification’...|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: Permanent Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) {{networks}} of Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) are becoming routinely used for surveying activities, including {{maintenance of the}} geodetic datum, deformation monitoring and land surveying. These networks consist of several fixed GNSS antennas and receivers that operate on a 24 -hour basis and provide positional information to those who request it. Before a network {{can be used in}} survey application it must be validated to ensure the results required for specific tasks are achievable. The NSW Department of Lands (DOL) has developed a network of CORS, predominantly covering the Sydney basin called Sydnet. The network objective was to provide a user with centimetre accurate coordinates, regardless of their position, using static and real-time kinetic (RTK) applications. This dissertation tested and validated the coordinate information provided by Sydnet against class 2 A and class B for horizontal and class LB and class LC for AHD heights of coordinated permanent survey marks found in the northern suburbs and northern beaches of Sydney. The outcome determined whether the information provided could position a user with an accuracy and precision that is acceptable under current legislation. The aim was to evaluate and critically analyse the horizontal and vertical results of GNSS observations using Sydnet with respect to accuracy, precision and reliability. Research into the Sydnet system was critical to determine its functionality and limitations before, a network of control marks was planned to test these limits. The test network was based on careful planning to ensure that the special selection of known coordinated survey marks chosen, provided the necessary geometry along with mocking field simulated situations i. e. sky obstructions. The essential field observation data was collected in a manner that conformed to the ICSM SP 1 standard to make certain the best possible outcome for tests 1 and 2 were achieved which were as follows: Test 1 : Rapid static GNSS observations undertaken were to comply with a Class B survey requiring two occupations of seven of the eight marks in the network and three occupations of the eighth mark all for a half hour period. Test 2 : Real-time static application occupied each mark in the network firstly, for a ten minute period from two separate base CORS and secondly, for a one minute period from the same two base CORS on a separate day. Through Leica Geo Office and Microsoft Excel software, the data was processed to determine observed values at each network <b>control</b> <b>mark,</b> and then compared with the true value of each mark, with the final outcome determining Sydnet’s accuracy, precision and reliability. Analysis of results has proven that Sydnet {{can be used as a}} reliable GNSS tool for two-dimensional surveys at present provided that certain procedures are adhered to. Heights provided using Sydnet have proven less than adequate in both accuracy and precision tests and if possible other methods should be used for project completion until the systems refinement. The tests for reliability proved a 94...|$|E

Campaigns involved control surveys, coordination of photo control and elevation profiles, utilising the different GPS positioning techniques listed. The logistical problems of coordinating survey marks in areas of sparse survey control, deploying photo control targets over snow for image acquisition are discussed. The imagery acquired, in both winter (snow cover) and spring (no-snow cover), was later used to create surface models. The required positional accuracies resulting from the GPS surveys, for the photogrammetric validation purposes, were < 20 mm for both Easting and Northing (MGA 94, Zone 55), and < 50 mm for elevation (AHD). The required post-processing {{and the results of}} rigorous network adjustment are also detailed. GPS static data was network adjusted from simultaneous state-wide GPSnet data using MGA 94 coordinates derived from the ARGN. Network adjustments were required to obtain the best possible coordinates for <b>control</b> <b>marks</b> and photo <b>control</b> targets.
