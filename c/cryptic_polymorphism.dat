40|$|Some {{mutations}} in human mitochondrial tRNAs are severely pathogenic. The available computational methods have a poor record of predicting {{the impact of}} a tRNA mutation on the phenotype and fitness. Here patterns of evolution at tRNA sites that harbor pathogenic mutations and at sites that harbor phenoty-pically <b>cryptic</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> were compared. Mutations that are pathogenic to humans occupy more con-servative sites, are only rarely fixed in closely related species, and, when located in stem structures, often disrupt Watsonâ€“Crick pairing and display signs of compensatory evolution. These observations make it possible to classify 90 % of all known pathogenic mutations as deleterious together with only 30 % of polymorphisms. These polymorphisms segregate at frequencies that are more than two times lower than fre-quencies of polymorphisms classified as benign, indicating that at least 30 % of known polymorphisms in mitochondrial tRNAs affect fitness negatively...|$|R
40|$|Clinal {{variation}} {{is common for}} enzymes in the glycolytic pathway for Drosophila melanogaster and is generally accepted as an adaptive response to different climates. Although the enzyme phosphoglucomutase (PGM) possesses several allozyme polymorphisms, it is unique in {{that it had been}} reported to show no clinal variation. Our recent DNA sequence investigation of Pgm found extensive <b>cryptic</b> amino acid <b>polymorphism</b> segregating with the allozyme alleles. In this study, we characterize the geographic variation of Pgm amino acid polymorphisms at the nucleotide level along a latitudinal cline in the eastern United States. A survey of 15 SNPs across the Pgm gene finds significant clinal differentiation for the allozyme polymorphisms as well as for many of the <b>cryptic</b> amino acid <b>polymorphisms.</b> A test of independence shows that pervasive linkage disequilibrium across this gene region can explain many of the amino acid clines. A single Pgm haplotype defined by two amino acid polymorphisms shows the strongest correlation with latitude and the steepest change in allele frequency across the cline. We propose that clinal selection at Pgm may in part explain the extensive amino acid polymorphism at this locus and is consistent with a multilocus response to selection in the glycolytic pathway...|$|R
40|$|The common endosymbiotic Wolbachia {{bacteria}} influence arthropod hosts {{in multiple}} ways. They are mostly recognized for their manipulations of host reproduction, yet, more recent studies demonstrate that Wolbachia also impact host behavior, metabolic pathways and immunity. Besides their biological and evolutionary roles, Wolbachia are new potential biological control agents for pest and vector management. Importantly, Wolbachia-based control strategies require controlled symbiont transfer between host species and predictable outcomes of novel Wolbachia-host associations. Theoretically, this artificial horizontal transfer could inflict genetic changes within transferred Wolbachia populations. This could be facilitated through de novo mutations {{in the novel}} recipient host or changes of haplotype frequencies of polymorphic Wolbachia populations when transferred from donor to recipient hosts. Here we show that Wolbachia resident in the European cherry fruit fly, Rhagoletis cerasi, exhibit ancestral and <b>cryptic</b> sequence <b>polymorphism</b> in three symbiont genes, which are exposed upon microinjection into the new hosts Drosophila simulans and Ceratitis capitata. Our analyses of Wolbachia in microinjected D. simulans over 150 generations after microinjection uncovered infections with multiple Wolbachia strains in trans-infected lines {{that had previously been}} typed as single infections. This confirms the persistence of low-titer Wolbachia strains in microinjection experiments that had previously escaped standard detection techniques. Our study demonstrates that infections by multiple Wolbachia strains can shift in prevalence after artificial host transfer driven by either stochastic o...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{approach to the}} optimization of crypsis in heterogeneous habitats. Our model habitat consists of two different microhabitats, and the optimal combination of crypsis in the microhabitats is supposed to maximize the probability of escaping detection by a predator. The probability of escaping detection for a prey is a function of: (i) degree of crypsis, (ii) probability of occurrence in the microhabitats and (iii) probability of encountering a predator in the microhabitats. Because crypsis is background-specific there is a trade-off between crypsis in two visually different microhabitats. Depending {{on the nature of}} the trade-off, the optimal coloration is either a compromise between the requirements of the differing microhabitats or entirely adapted to only one of them. An increased risk of predation in one of the microhabitats favours increased crypsis in that microhabitat. Because the trade-off constrains possible optimal solutions, it is not possible to predict the optimal coloration only from factors (i) â€“(iii). However, habitat choice may fundamentally change the situation. If minimizing predation risk does not incur any costs, the prey should exclusively prefer the microhabitat where it has a lower probability of encountering a predator and better crypsis. The implications of these results for variation in <b>cryptic</b> coloration and <b>polymorphism</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Gynodioecy, the {{coexistence}} of hermaphrodites and females (i. e. male-sterile plants) in natural plant populations, most often results from polymorphism at genetic loci {{involved in a}} particular interaction between the nuclear and cytoplasmic genetic compartments (cytonuclear epistasis) : cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS). Although CMS clearly contributes to the coevolution of involved nuclear loci and cytoplasmic genomes in gynodioecious species, the occurrence of CMS genetic factors {{in the absence of}} sexual <b>polymorphism</b> (<b>cryptic</b> CMS) is not easily detected and rarely taken in consideration. We found cryptic CMS in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana after crossing distantly related accessions, Sha and Mr- 0. Male sterility resulted from an interaction between the Sha cytoplasm and two Mr- 0 genomic regions located on chromosome 1 and chromosome 3. Additional accessions with either nuclear sterility maintainers or sterilizing cytoplasms were identified from crosses with either Sha or Mr- 0. By comparing two very closely related cytoplasms with different male-sterility inducing abilities, we identified a novel mitochondrial ORF, named orf 117 Sha, that is most likely the sterilizing factor of the Sha cytoplasm. The presence of orf 117 Sha was investigated in worldwide natural accessions. It was found mainly associated with a single chlorotype in accessions belonging to a clade predominantly originating from Central Asia. More than one-third of accessions from this clade carried orf 117 Sha, indicating that the sterilizing-inducing cytoplasm had spread in this lineage. We also report the {{coexistence of}} the sterilizing cytoplasm with a non-sterilizing cytoplasm at a small, local scale in a natura...|$|R
