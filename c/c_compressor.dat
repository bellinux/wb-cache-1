Surface hot-film sensor observations are interpreted with the aid of numerical solutions from UNSFLO, a quasi-three dimensional viscous-inviscid flow solver. The passage of a rotor wake, with its associated negative jet, over the stator leading edge is observed to have a destabilizing effect on the suction surface boundary layer. This leads to transition closer to the stator leading edge than would have occurred under steady flow conditions. The strength of this phenomenon is influenced by the rotor-stator axial gap and the variability of individual rotor wake disturbances. A variety of transition phenomena is observed near the leading edge in the wake path. Wave packets characteristic of Tollmien-Schlichting waves are observed to amplify and break down into turbulent spots. Disturbances characteristic of the streaky structures occurring in bypass transition are also seen. Examination of suction surface disturbance and wake-induced transitional strip trajectories points to the leading edge as the principal receptivity site for suction surface transition phenomena at design loading conditions. This contrasts markedly with the pressure surface behavior, where transition at design conditions occurs remotely from leading-edge flow perturbations associated with wake chopping.

In fact {{it allows the}} characterization of the complex behaviour of turbomachinery components with high fidelity. Together with the availability of more and more powerful computing resources, current trends pursue the adoption of such high-fidelity tools and state-of-the-art technology even in the preliminary design phases. Within such a framework Graphical Processing Units (GPUS) yield further growth potential, allowing a significant reduction of CFD process turn-around times at relatively low costs. The target of the present work is to illustrate the design and implementation of an explicit density-based RANS coupled solver for the efficient and accurate numerical simulation of multi-dimensional time-dependent compressible fluid flows on polyhedral unstructured meshes. The solver has been developed within the object-oriented OpenFOAM framework, using OpenCL bindings to interface CPU and GPU and using MPI to interface multiple GPUS.

The results with the first chiller equipped with a counter-current plate evaporator showed that both capacity and EER are maintained within ± 5 %. The second chiller, which was not equipped with a counter-current evaporator showed poorer results. Capacity and EER were reduced by about 13 % and 10 %, respectively, as overall heat transfer coefficients were degraded {{by as much as}} 30 % in the evaporator and about 10 % in the condenser.

This work stemmed from the observation that the optimization of the thermodynamic cycle and the design of the system components can be integrated into a single calculation procedure, which can be subjected to an automated constrained optimization process. The objective of this work is therefore to perform a preliminary assessment of the envisaged methodology. First, the thermodynamic analysis is performed and consists in the study of three s-CO 2 power cycle configurations. The thermal efficiency is prescribed to 50 % with a power output of 18. 7 MW respectively. The effect of the components operation on the turbine inlet temperature (TIT) and regeneration load is studied. The recompression Brayton cycle configuration allows to comply with the specified performance with the lowest turbine inlet temperature (787 C) and at moderate maximum pressure (272 bar). The operating conditions given by this analysis are used as inputs for the design of the regenerator and the cooler. The models of these heat exchangers are validated against the design and performance data of an existing s-CO 2 heat exchanger, and well-known commercial design code. The methodology that combines the thermodynamic analysis and the components design is tested with two study cases. The first one is aimed as a first assessment of the adoption of a s-CO 2 closed Brayton gas turbine for aircraft propulsion. The s-CO 2 power system is designed such that it exceeds the performance rating of a cutting-edge turbofan, {{and at the same time}} the weight of the system is decreased as much as possible.

It is based on experimental and modeling works carried out on: a) 	A hermetic scroll compressor used inside an air-cooled water chiller. b) 	An oil-free open-drive scroll expander integrated into an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) power system. <b>c)</b> 	Open-drive scroll <b>compressor</b> and expander used in a Liquid Flooded Ericsson Cycle Cooler (LFEC). Such a system uses the liquid flooding of the compressor and of the expander to approach isothermal compression and expansion processes. New semi-empirical models of the scroll compressor and expander were proposed and existing models improved. A deterministic model of the scroll expander was established. The model associates a geometrical description of the machine with a thermodynamic description of the expansion process. This model was validated for the two expanders investigated experimentally. The model validation revealed that {{the performance of the}} expanders is mainly affected by the supply pressure drop and by the internal leakages. Using the validated model, parametric studies were carried out to investigate the variation of the performance of both expanders with modification of their design and with the operating parameters. The thesis also investigated the scroll machines {{from the point of view}} of their integration into thermal systems. A first experimental investigation was carried out on an air-cooled chiller. The scroll compressor semi-empirical model, with its parameters identified on the basis of published manufacturer data, was used as a refrigerant flow meter. The analysis of the experimental data allowed a better understanding of the chiller operation and a better identification of its model parameters (such as the fan and the hot gas bypass control models). A second experimental investigation was carried out on an ORC power system, working with R 123. In order to select the most appropriate fluid, the performances achieved with four different fluids were compared by simulation. The experimental study confirmed that the scroll expander is a good candidate for an ORC system: the tested prototype presented a good performance (the maximum global isentropic effectiveness achieved was 68 %). Using an ORC simulation model, parametric studies were carried out to investigate the effects of the expander characteristics and operating conditions on the cycle performance. The latter is mainly affected by the expander internal leakage and by the liquid subcooling at the condenser exhaust. A third experimental investigation was performed on a LFEC working with nitrogen as refrigerant and alkyl-benzene oil as flooding liquid. Experimental data was used to identify the parameters of the scroll compressor and expander semi-empirical models. Parametric studies were performed to identify the different factors affecting their performance.

40|$|The Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) and the Supercritical Carbon Dioxide (S-C 0 ₂) Recompression cycle are two {{technologies}} {{that have the}} potential to impact the power generation landscape of the future. In order for their implementation to be successful, they must compete economically with existing light water reactors and the conventional Rankine cycle. Improvements in efficiency, while maintaining safety and proliferation goals, will allow the SFR to better compete in the electricity generation market. These improvements will depend on core design as well as the balance of plant, including the choice of steam or C 0 ₂ as the working fluid. This work has developed some of the tools necessary for evaluating different design core and balance of plant options. Much of it has concentrated on the S-C 0 ₂ Recompression cycle. S-C 0 ₂ promises to be useful as a working fluid in high-efficiency power conversion systems for SFRs because it achieves higher efficiencies at the high temperatures associated with SFRs. The recompression cycle is capable of operating with very high efficiencies due to the low compressor work needed when C 0 ₂ approaches its critical point at the compressor inlet.

A steady-state code for analysis of the recompression cycle was previously developed at MIT in the form of CYCLES II, but the present work has made significant improvements to this code that make the new version, CYCLES III, more versatile. (cont.) This code can help to size components of the system and predict the costs and performance of the system at steady -state. Coupling of the primary and secondary loops is a major concern, the construction of the intermediate loop and associated heat exchangers (IHX) being critical to cost, efficiency, and safety. Furthermore, there is little experience in industry with large-scale compressors for S-C 0 ₂. The experience that has been gained is typically proprietary. Most existing <b>C</b> 0 ₂ <b>compressors</b> do not operate near the critical point and therefore, perform much like any other semi-ideal gas compressor. Accordingly, consistent, usable models of non-ideal gas compressors have been developed in the present work to produce preliminary designs and performance maps for the compressors in S-C 0 ₂ recompression cycles. Compressor designs were developed for a 500 MWth S-C 0 ₂ recompression cycle. The main compressor achieves an operating point total-to-static efficiency of 90. 4 % and the recompressing compressor achieves 91. 4 %. Further work can continue once these areas have been developed, including transient analysis, the effects of impurities on the system, and investigation of cycles which operate on other working fluids. Additionally, changes in the intermediate loop, the arrangement of the reactor vessel, and in-core changes will affect the efficiency of the SFR. These include the option of diluent grading in the fuel, flattening of the core outlet temperature profile, choosing Rankine or S-C 0 ₂ for the balance of plant, and heat exchanger design. All these have been evaluated for their impact on plant efficiency. (cont.) It has been determined that the S-C 0 ₂ recompression cycle can provide efficiency benefits over conventional Rankine cycles for SFRs with core outlet temperatures at or above 510 oC. With the S-C 0 ₂ cycle, SFRs can achieve thermal efficiencies of ~ 42 %. by Alexander R. Ludington. Thesis (S. M.)
