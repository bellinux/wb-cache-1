5|$|Greater {{problems}} arose over financial {{speculation and}} {{the management of the}} national debt. Certain government bonds could not be redeemed without the consent of the bondholder and had been issued when interest rates were high; consequently each bond represented a long-term drain on public finances, as bonds were hardly ever redeemed. In 1719 the South Sea Company proposed to take over £31million (three fifths) of the British national debt by exchanging government securities for stock in the company. The Company bribed Lord Sunderland, George's mistress Melusine von der Schulenburg, and Lord Stanhope's cousin, Charles Stanhope, who was Secretary of the Treasury, to support their plan. The Company enticed bondholders to convert their high-interest, irredeemable bonds to low-interest, easily tradeable stocks by offering apparently preferential financial gains. Company prices rose rapidly; the shares had cost £128 on 1 January 1720, but were valued at £500 when the <b>conversion</b> <b>scheme</b> opened in May. On 24 June the price reached a peak of £1,050. The company's success led to the speculative flotation of other companies, some of a bogus nature, and the Government, in an attempt to suppress these schemes and {{with the support of the}} Company, passed the Bubble Act. With the rise in the market now halted, uncontrolled selling began in August, which caused the stock to plummet to £150 by the end of September. Many individuals—including aristocrats—lost vast sums and some were completely ruined. George, who had been in Hanover since June, returned to London in November—sooner than he wanted or was usual—at the request of the ministry.|$|E

40|$|Single-shot qubit readout {{typically}} combines high readout {{contrast with}} long-lived readout signals, leading to large signal-to-noise ratios and high readout fidelities. In recent years, {{it has been}} demonstrated that both readout contrast and readout signal lifetime, and thus the signal-to-noise ratio, can be enhanced by forcing the qubit state to transition through intermediate states. In this work, we demonstrate that the sub-Poissonian relaxation statistics introduced by intermediate states can reduce the single-shot readout error rate by orders of magnitude even {{when there is no}} increase in signal-to-noise ratio. These results hold for moderate values of the signal-to-noise ratio (S≲ 100) and a small number of intermediate states (N ≲ 10). The ideas presented here could have important implications for readout schemes relying on the detection of transient charge states, such as spin-to-charge <b>conversion</b> <b>schemes</b> for semiconductor spin qubits and parity-to-charge <b>conversion</b> <b>schemes</b> for topologically protected Majorana qubits.

40|$|The {{power quality}} and {{resiliency}} (or self-healing capacity) {{characteristics of a}} renewable energy based microgrid (REM) are limited majorly due to their inherent dependency on the static power electronics based energy conversion devices. Whereas, conventional electrical machines based power plants possess good power quality and resiliency characteristics due to their high inertia and control features. So, the REMs’ research need to be shifted towards making its operation similar to conventional electrical machines based power plant. With this intent, this paper proposes two DC/AC energy <b>conversion</b> <b>schemes</b> that are designed based on the theory of electrical machines such as DC Motor (DCM) and Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG). The first scheme is a rotary inverter (named as RDCMIGI) that replaces the conventional static power electronic inverter with a real DCM-DFIG set. The second scheme is a static inverter (named as VDCMIGI) that uses a pulse width modulated power electronic inverter, whose modulating signals are generated through a closed loop virtual DCM-DFIG based control system. These two schemes emulate the behavior of electrical machines based conventional power plant in REM, {{which leads to the}} improvement of power quality through the smooth control of voltage/frequency and resiliency through the injection of necessary moment of inertia. For the analysis, the conventional/proposed energy <b>conversion</b> <b>schemes</b> are modeled in MATLAB/Simulink® and are tested during various uncertainties. From the results, it is observed that the proposed DC/AC energy <b>conversion</b> <b>schemes</b> have effectively improved the power quality and resiliency, and thereby, leverages REMs as better future grids...|$|R

Those photoelectric converters are composed of X-ray absorber and electron collector sheets nested concentrically in an onion-like array. Indeed, since X-rays can go through far greater thickness of material than electrons can, many layers are needed to absorb most of the X-rays.

50|$|In October 1913 Billinton {{ordered the}} design of an {{enlarged}} version of the J class tank, with the trailing truck replaced by a bogie. This 4-6-4 or Baltic wheel arrangement {{was intended to be}} more stable at speed than the 4-6-2 arrangement of the original design. An order for five locomotives was placed with Brighton Works in November 1913, and the first, no. 327, was completed in April 1914. Construction of the second member of the class, no. 328, was interrupted whilst no. 327 was tested. As at the same time Billinton began a project to design and construct an express 4-6-0 tender locomotive, {{it has been suggested that}} he may have been intending to complete no. 328 as such. No. 327 was involved in a couple of minor derailments in August and November 1914, which were ascribed to the surging movement of water in half-full side tanks. The locomotive was withdrawn from service whilst consideration was given to its conversion to a tender engine. Billinton instructed the drawing office in February 1915 to cost both a <b>conversion</b> <b>scheme</b> and a scheme to modify the side tanks to improve stability. As costs appeared to be almost equal it was decided to complete no. 328 as a tank engine, and to modify both locomotives by inserting a well tank between the frames and restricting the depth of water in the side tanks. By the time no. 328 was completed in March 1916 the order for the remaining three locomotives had been cancelled because of wartime material shortages, and nos. 327 and 328 remained the only members of the L class until 1919.|$|E
