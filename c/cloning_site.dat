2500|$|Reporter genes: Some vectors {{may contain}} a {{reporter}} gene {{that allow for}} identification of plasmid that contains inserted DNA sequence. [...] An example is lacZ-α which codes for the N-terminus fragment of β-galactosidase, an enzyme that digests galactose. [...] A multiple <b>cloning</b> <b>site</b> is located within lacZ-α, and an insert successfully ligated into the vector will disrupt the gene sequence, resulting in an inactive β-galactosidase. [...] Cells containing vector with an insert may be identified using blue/white selection by growing cells in media containing an analogue of galactose (X-gal). Cells expressing β-galactosidase (therefore doesn't contain an insert) appear as blue colonies. White colonies would be selected as those that may contain an insert. Other commonly used reporters include green fluorescent protein and luciferase.|$|E
2500|$|In a cloning experiment, a gene may be {{inserted}} into a plasmid used for transformation. [...] However, in such experiment, {{not all the}} plasmids may contain a successfully inserted gene. [...] Additional techniques may therefore be employed further to screen for transformed cells that contain plasmid with the insert. [...] Reporter genes {{can be used as}} markers, such as the lacZ gene which codes for β-galactosidase used in blue-white screening. [...] This method of screening relies on the principle of α-complementation, where a fragment of the lacZ gene (lacZα) in the plasmid can complement another mutant lacZ gene (lacZΔM15) in the cell. [...] Both genes by themselves produce non-functional peptides, however, when expressed together, as when a plasmid containing lacZ-α is transformed into a lacZΔM15 cells, they form a functional β-galactosidase. [...] The presence of an active β-galactosidase may be detected when cells are grown in plates containing X-gal, forming characteristic blue colonies. [...] However, the multiple <b>cloning</b> <b>site,</b> where a gene of interest may be ligated into the plasmid vector, is located within the lacZα gene. [...] Successful ligation therefore disrupts the lacZα gene, and no functional β-galactosidase can form, resulting in white colonies. [...] Cells containing successfully ligated insert can then be easily identified by its white coloration from the unsuccessful blue ones.|$|E

The current methods that applied in protein-protein interaction, such as co-immunoprecipitation and pull down etc., often cause plenty of working time {{due to the}} burdensome cloning and purification procedures. Here we established a system that characterization of protein-protein interaction was accomplished by co-expression and simply purification of target proteins from one expression cassette within E. coli system. We modified pET vector into co-expression vector pInvivo which encoded PPV NIa protease, two cleavage site F and two multiple <b>cloning</b> <b>sites</b> that flanking cleavage sites. The target proteins (for example: protein A and protein B) were inserted at multiple <b>cloning</b> <b>sites</b> and translated into polyprotein {{in the order of}} MBP tag-protein A-site F-PPV NIa protease-site F-protein B-His 6 tag. PPV NIa protease carried out intracellular cleavage along expression, then led to the separation of polyprotein components, therefore, the interaction between protein A-protein B can be detected through one-step purification and analysis. Negative control for protein B was brought into this system for monitoring interaction specificity. We successfully employed this system to prove two cases of reported protien-protein interaction: RHA 2 a/ANAC and FTA/FTB. In conclusion, a convenient and efficient system has been successfully developed for detecting protein-protein interaction.|$|R

Bovine brain 14 - 3 - 3 eta chain cDNA was PCR-amplified and used to demonstrate the expression capacity of the newly constructed vectors. A significant increase in expression of 14 - 3 - 3 protein was observed when synthetic TIRs were used in the place of the cII TIR. Expression levels vary from 15 % to 48 % of total cell protein. The effects of a reported translational enhancer from phage T 7 on expression of the 14 - 3 - 3 protein are also discussed.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{identification}} of protein trafficking signals, and their interacting mechanisms, {{is a fundamental}} objective of modern biology. Unfortunately, the analysis of trafficking signals is complicated by their topography, hierarchical nature and regulation. Powerful strategies to test candidate motifs include their ability to direct simpler reporter proteins, {{to which they are}} fused, to the appropriate cellular compartment. However, present reporters are limited by their endogenous expression, paucity of <b>cloning</b> <b>sites,</b> and difficult detection in live cells. Results Consequently, we have engineered a mammalian expression vector encoding a novel trafficking reporter – pIN-G – consisting of a simple, type I integral protein bearing permissive intra/extracellular <b>cloning</b> <b>sites,</b> green fluorescent protein (GFP), cMyc and HA epitope tags. Fluorescence imaging, flow cytometry and biochemical assays of transfected HEK 293 cells, confirm the size, topology and surface expression of PIN-G. Moreover, a pIN-G fusion construct, containing a Trans-Golgi Network (TGN) targeting determinant, internalises rapidly from the cell surface and localises to the TGN. Additionally, another PIN-G fusion protein and its mutants reveal trafficking determinants in the cytoplasmic carboxy terminus of Kv 1. 4 voltage-gated potassium channels. Conclusion Together, these data indicate that pIN-G is a versatile, powerful, new reporter for analysing signals controlling membrane protein trafficking, surface expression and dynamics. </p...|$|R
