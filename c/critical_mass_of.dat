At some point the accumulated gas can reach the conditions necessary for hydrogen fusion to occur, producing a runaway reaction that will drive a portion of the gas from the surface. This would result in a (recurrent) nova explosion—a cataclysmic variable star—and the luminosity of the white dwarf rapidly would increase by several magnitudes for a period of several days or months. An example of such a star system is RS Ophiuchi, a binary system consisting of a red giant and a white dwarf companion.

5|$|Britain {{contributed to}} the Manhattan Project by helping {{initiate}} the effort to build the first atomic bombs in the United States during World War II, and helped carry it through to completion in August 1945 by supplying crucial expertise. Following the discovery of nuclear fission in uranium, scientists Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch at the University of Birmingham calculated, in March 1940, that the <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> a metallic sphere of pure uranium-235 was as little as , and would explode {{with the power of}} thousands of tons of dynamite. The Frisch–Peierls memorandum prompted Britain to create an atomic bomb project, known as Tube Alloys. Mark Oliphant, an Australian physicist working in Britain, was instrumental in making the results of the British MAUD Report known in the United States in 1941 by a visit in person. Initially the British project was larger and more advanced, but after the United States entered the war, the American project soon outstripped and dwarfed its British counterpart. The British government then decided to shelve its own nuclear ambitions, and participate in the American project.|$|E

Kortnight, Miguel Andino and Fernando Fernández. They were then to proceed to the sugarcane fields of Miguel Figueres, and retrieve cutlasses and swords which were hidden in those fields. Xiorro, together with a slave from the McBean plantation named Mario and another slave named Narciso, would lead the slaves of Bayamón and Toa Baja and capture the city of Bayamón. They would then burn the city and kill those who were not black. After this, they would all unite with slaves from the adjoining towns of Río Piedras, Guaynabo and Palo Seco. With this <b>critical</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> slaves, all armed and emboldened from a series of quick victories, they would then invade the capital city of San Juan, where they would declare Xiorro as their king.

Polyethylene is usually present in TRU waste as a result of glovebox bagout operations and as liners in 55 gallon drums. The methodology utilized the SCALE driver CSAS 1 X.

For TRU solid waste, tests with 55 gallon drums indicate that polyethylene bagging cannot be tightly stuffed to a volume fraction greater than 15. 5 %. To allow for settling, calculations were conducted for 20 % and 50 % polyethylene volume fractions as well as for full density for comparison. The effects of 10 % concrete or steel mixed with 20 % polyethylene were also evaluated. Since water egress into underground solid waste containers would be possible, additional calculations evaluated <b>critical</b> <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> water in polyethylene moderator.
