After having gotten back to Delta Alpha Kappa sorority house, while opening up presents, Kelli and her sisters are called by an unknown caller who, initially, uses Clair's phone and later Megan's. Worried about Megan, Kelli goes to her room only to find Kyle there. While attempting to find clues about her disappearance the power goes out, causing Megan's computer to switch on from standby mode, revealing a recording Kyle made of himself having sex with Megan. After kicking him out of, she meets Clair's elder half-sister Leigh who <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> looking for her.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 1824, the Senate {{voted to}} repeal the law that had {{established}} the Court of Appeals and {{to establish a new}} Court of Appeals with four justices. The measure <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> floor on December 23. During the debate, Governor Desha personally lobbied legislators to support the measure, a blatant violation of the rules of the House. The next day the measure passed in the House by a vote of 5443. Governor Desha appointed pro-relief stalwart William T. Barry as Chief Justice, and three associate justices who were also Relief Party supporters.|$|E

25|$|However, Clark {{remained}} belligerent in his {{attacks on}} the Trudeau government, angrily clashing with the prime minister in Parliament. He hired experienced staffers such as Lowell Murray, Duncan Edmonds, and William Neville, who shaped his policies and ran his office efficiently. He improved his party's standing in national opinion polls. Clark worked very hard, and gradually earned the respect of most people, including his own caucus, by presenting a series of well thought out speeches and questions in Parliament. He benefited when live television <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons in 1977, allowing viewers {{to see that he}} was evolving into a real rival for Trudeau.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} morning of 22 May 2013, a girlfriend {{of one of the}} sons left the house. At 6:40AM, Mrs. Haroková called the grammar school where she worked, saying that she had a bad {{headache}} and would take the day off. The police believe that she and two other victims were killed between this time and 8:00AM, which was the moment at which Mrs Haroková's wristwatch stopped. A post woman arrived at the door shortly before nine. The doorbell was answered by Dahlgren, who accepted the mail. Two hours later, a cleaner <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> but was sent away by Dahlgren immediately after entering the hallway. Meanwhile, the fourth victim, David, who was at school, received text messages from Dahlgren's phone that they would go running after his return. David was probably murdered immediately after returning to the house around 12:30PM.|$|E
25|$|Helen is safely away {{to recover}} from her concussion. Inspector Morton asks each family member to account for {{themselves}} {{on the day of}} Cora Lansquenet's murder after which Poirot makes a surprising statement which shocked everyone present. Cora had not come to the funeral at all. It was Miss Gilchrist in disguise, as part of a plot for her own gain, leaving Cora home asleep from a sedative in her tea. Miss Gilchrist planted the idea that Richard Abernethie's death had been a murder - when Cora is murdered, it would seem that Richard's alleged murderer had killed Cora to silence her. None of the family had seen Cora for more than two decades, due to the ill-feeling {{at the time of her}} marriage. Miss Gilchrist copied her mannerisms and the only flaw in her portrayal was spotted by Helen Abernethie - Miss Gilchrist had rehearsed a characteristic turn of the head in a mirror, where the reflection is a reverse of reality; when she <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> after the funeral, she turned her head to the left, not the right. After a timely conversation among the young cousins, Helen realises this difference. Miss Gilchrist gave herself away to Poirot by referring to the wax flowers on the green malachite table the first day the relatives gathered to select objects before the auction: these were on display on the day of the reading of Richard Abernethie's will but removed by the time Miss Gilchrist, as herself, visited Enderby Hall. She had deliberately poisoned herself with the arsenic-laced wedding cake to evade suspicion and appear yet another potential victim, which aroused suspicion.|$|E

25|$|Around 2 A.M. on April 15, 1865, {{members of}} the District of Columbia police visited the Surratt {{boarding}} house, seeking John Wilkes Booth and John Surratt. Why the police <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> is not entirely clear. Most historians conclude that Weichmann's friend, Department of War employee Daniel Gleason, had alerted federal authorities to Confederate activity centered on the Surratt house, {{but that does not}} explain why police rather than federal agents appeared there. (Historian Roy Chamlee, however, says that there is evidence that Gleason did not tell police about his suspicions of Weichmann for several days.) Within 45 minutes of the attack on Lincoln, John Surratt's name had become associated with the attack on Secretary of State William H. Seward. The police as well as the Provost Marshal's office both had files on John Surratt, Jr., and knew he was a close friend of Booth. (It is possible that either James L. Maddox, property supervisor at Ford's Theatre and a friend of Booth's, or actor John Matthews, both of whom may have known about the plot to attack government officials, mentioned Surratt's name.) Historian Otto Eisenschiml has argued that David Herold's attempt to steal a horse from John Fletcher may have led them to the Surratt boarding house, but at least one other scholar has called the link uncertain. Other sources claim that eyewitnesses had identified Booth as Lincoln's attacker, and the detectives had information (a tip from an unnamed actor and a bartender) linking John, Jr., to Booth. Mary lied to the detectives that her son had been in Canada for two weeks. She also did not reveal that she had delivered a package to the tavern on Booth's behalf, only hours earlier.|$|E
500|$|Chartwell {{has become}} among the National Trust's most popular properties; in 2016 some 232,000 {{visitors}} <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> In that year, the fiftieth {{anniversary of the}} house's opening, the Trust launched the Churchill's Chartwell Appeal, to raise £7.1M {{for the purchase of}} hundreds of personal items held at Chartwell on loan from the Churchill family. The items available to the Trust include Churchill's Nobel Prize in Literature awarded to him in 1953. The citation for the award reads, [...] "for his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values". The medal is currently displayed in the Museum room on the first floor at Chartwell, {{at the opposite end of}} the house to the study from which, in words used by John F. Kennedy when awarding him honorary citizenship of the United States, Churchill, [...] "mobilized the English language and sent it into battle".|$|E
500|$|In {{the opinion}} of Robin Fedden, a diplomat, and later Deputy General Secretary of the National Trust {{and author of the}} Trust's first guidebook for Chartwell, the house became [...] "the most {{important}} country house in Europe". A stream of friends, colleagues, disgruntled civil servants and concerned military officers <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> to provide information to support Churchill's struggle against appeasement. At Chartwell, he developed what Fedden calls, his own [...] "little Foreign Office... the hub of resistance". The Chartwell visitors' book, meticulously maintained from 1922, records some 780 house guests, not all of them friends, but all grist to Churchill's mill. An example of the latter was Sir Maurice Hankey, Clerk of the Privy Council, who was Churchill's guest for dinner in April 1936. Hankey subsequently wrote, [...] "I do not usually make a note of private conversations but some points arose which gave an indication of the line which Mr Churchill is likely to take in forthcoming debates (on munitions and supply) in Parliament". A week later, Reginald Leeper, a senior Foreign Office official and confident of Robert Vansittart, visited Churchill to convey their views on the need to use the League of Nations to counter German aggression. Vansittart wrote, [...] "there is no time to lose. There is indeed a great danger that we shall be too late".|$|E

2500|$|Franklin v. South Carolina, [...] was {{the trial}} of Pink Franklin {{for the murder of}} South Carolina Constable Henry H. Valentine in 1907.

The defense included claims that Franklin acted in self-defense and that the peonage laws were unjust. In appeal, the defense claimed that the make-up of the jury, all white based on the requirement that the jury be based on those who were eligible to vote, was based on unconstitutional racism in election laws stemming from the 1895 South Carolina constitution. Franklin's conviction was upheld in all appeals, including the appeal before the United States Supreme Court heard in April 1910.|$|E
