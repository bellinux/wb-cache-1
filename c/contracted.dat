30|$|The use of <b>contracts</b> differs across {{commodities}}. Some commodities use primarily production <b>contracts,</b> {{some use}} marketing <b>contracts</b> {{and others have}} little use of <b>contracts</b> of any type. 1 With the exception of dairy production, for which <b>contracts</b> are mostly marketing <b>contracts,</b> the majority of <b>contracts</b> in livestock production are production <b>contracts.</b> A smaller share of crops are under <b>contract,</b> and most <b>contracts</b> are marketing <b>contracts</b> (O’Donoghue et al. 2011). The use of <b>contracts</b> also varies by farm size; large commercial farms {{are more likely to}} use production and/or marketing <b>contracts</b> and to use <b>contracts</b> for a larger share of their production (MacDonald and Korb 2011; MacDonald et al. 2004).|$|R
50|$|In <b>contract</b> law the <b>contract</b> {{price is}} a {{material}} term.

If the <b>contract</b> price is not included in the written <b>contract,</b> then upon litigation the court may hold that a <b>contract</b> did not exist.|$|R

40|$|Classically, {{the root}} of the <b>contract</b> is the {{agreement}} of the <b>contracting</b> parties. That is why, sometime people consider the <b>contract</b> as the agreement of the <b>contracting</b> parties. However, the agreement is not the <b>contract.</b> The both are different. In fact, if for the <b>contracting</b> parties there is a <b>contract</b> after an agreement, for the law there is a <b>contract</b> when the agreement of the <b>contracting</b> parties respects the frame previewed by the law. That is why the <b>contract</b> must be an institution. This view of the <b>contract</b> enables to have another meaning and to gather the keys ideas of the different opinions on the meaning of the <b>contract.</b> Thanks to the <b>contract</b> as an institution, we can no longer be afraid of the crisis of the <b>contract...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a composite (CP) <b>contract</b> for a two-stage supply chain by organically combining two component contracts: a buy back (BB) <b>contract</b> and a quantity flexibility (QF) <b>contract.</b> The CP <b>contract</b> {{is shown to}} have advantages over both component <b>contracts</b> in terms of supply chain coordination, profit allocation, and risk allocation. In particular, we obtain the following results: (a) {{as long as one}} of the component <b>contracts</b> is able to coordinate the supply chain, so is the CP <b>contract.</b> Moreover, when <b>contract</b> parameters are constrained, we find situations where the CP <b>contract</b> coordinates the supply chain when neither of the component <b>contracts</b> coordinates. (b) When <b>contract</b> parameters are constrained, the CP <b>contract</b> is more flexible in terms of profit allocation among supply chain members than the component <b>contracts.</b> (c) The CP <b>contract</b> is more flexible in terms of risk allocation than the component <b>contracts.</b> Supply chain management <b>Contract</b> design Coordination Profit allocation Risk allocation...|$|R
50|$|Some <b>contracts,</b> {{known as}} {{executory}} <b>contracts,</b> may be rejected if canceling {{them would be}} financially favorable to {{the company and its}} creditors. Such <b>contracts</b> may include labor union <b>contracts,</b> supply or operating <b>contracts</b> (with both vendors and customers), and real estate leases. The standard feature of executory <b>contracts</b> is that each party to the <b>contract</b> has duties remaining under the <b>contract.</b> In the event of a rejection, the remaining parties to the <b>contract</b> become unsecured creditors of the debtor. For example, in some districts a <b>contract</b> for deed is an executory <b>contract,</b> while in others it is not.|$|R

5|$|While Roman {{emperors}} {{almost always}} married wives {{who were also}} Roman citizens, the ruling families of the empire's client kingdoms in the Near East and North Africa often <b>contracted</b> marriages with other royal houses to consolidate their position. These marriages were often <b>contracted</b> with the approval, or even at the behest, of the Roman emperors themselves. Rome thought that such marriages promoted stability among their client states and prevented petty local wars that would disturb the Pax Romana. Glaphyra of Cappadocia was known to have <b>contracted</b> three such royal intermarriages: with Juba II, King of Numidia and Mauretania, Alexander of Judea and Herod Archelaus, Ethnarch of Samaria.|$|E

5000|$|Futures: are <b>contracts</b> {{to buy or}} sell {{an asset}} on a future date at a price {{specified}} today. A futures <b>contract</b> differs from a forward <b>contract</b> in that the futures <b>contract</b> is a standardized <b>contract</b> written by a clearing house that operates an exchange where the <b>contract</b> can be bought and sold; the forward <b>contract</b> is a non-standardized <b>contract</b> written by the parties themselves.|$|R
50|$|A {{collateral}} <b>contract</b> {{is usually}} a single term <b>contract,</b> made in consideration of the party for whose benefit the <b>contract</b> operates agreeing {{to enter into the}} principal or main <b>contract,</b> which sets out additional terms relating to the same subject matter as the main <b>contract.</b> The collateral <b>contract</b> co-exists {{side by side with the}} main <b>contract.</b> For example, a collateral <b>contract</b> is formed when one party pays the other party a certain sum for entry into another <b>contract.</b> A collateral <b>contract</b> may be between one of the parties and a third party.|$|R

5|$|Another risk to rat owners is Rat-bite fever. This is a {{rare disease}} among domesticated rats and is most often found in rats from large chain pet stores who breed their stock of rats in masses (usually with the {{intention}} of being snake food rather than pets) or from breeders who fail to take good care of their rats. This disease is fairly unnoticeable in the rat, but is characterized by the swelling of the site of the bite or scratch where it was <b>contracted,</b> a fever, vomiting and body aches. It is <b>contracted</b> by being bitten or scratched by an infected rat.|$|E
5|$|As {{discussed}} above, any non-pseudoforest graph contains as a subgraph a handcuff, {{figure 8}}, or theta graph; any handcuff or figure 8 graph may be <b>contracted</b> {{to form a}} butterfly graph (five-vertex figure 8), and any theta graph may be <b>contracted</b> to form a diamond graph (four-vertex theta graph), so any non-pseudoforest contains either a butterfly or a diamond as a minor, {{and these are the}} only minor-minimal non-pseudoforest graphs. Thus, a graph is a pseudoforest if and only if it does not have the butterfly or the diamond as a minor. If one forbids only the diamond but not the butterfly, the resulting larger graph family consists of the cactus graphs and disjoint unions of multiple cactus graphs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>contract</b> of interim {{insurance}} is separate from and {{independent of the}} final <b>contract</b> of insurance following on the conclusion of an interim <b>contract,</b> although it may share some {{or most of the}} terms of the final <b>contract.</b> If a claim arises during the currency of the interim <b>contract,</b> it must be considered in terms of the interim <b>contract</b> itself, not in terms of the final <b>contract.</b> This may be of importance where only the final <b>contract,</b> not the interim <b>contract,</b> is voidable because of a misrepresentation or other unlawful conduct, and also where the terms of the two <b>contracts</b> differ.|$|R

40|$|This paper studies optimal {{managerial}} <b>contracts</b> applying both {{complete and}} incomplete <b>contracting</b> approaches. In a complete <b>contracting</b> environment where <b>contracts</b> can {{be based on}} earnings, an optimal <b>contract</b> is interpreted as a combination of base salary, golden parachute and bonus. When earnings are not veri able, two types of optimal <b>contracts</b> are derived: a <b>contract</b> with restricted stock ownership, and a <b>contract</b> with stock options. These three types of optimal <b>contracts</b> are payoff-equivalent in a strong sense: agents' ex ante and ex post payoffs are the same under all three <b>contracts.</b> This suggests that the choice of contractual form is irrelevant in the environment studied in this paper. Comparative static analyses of optimal <b>contracts</b> generate several testable hypotheses. ...|$|R
