3000|$|The paper’s {{findings}} {{also suggest that}} <b>Craigslist’s</b> entry might have had mixed welfare effects. In other words, while increased competition prompted by <b>Craigslist’s</b> entry benefitted online users by resulting in lower prices at competing employment websites, the entry also reduced online traffic at these websites. Because the gains of visiting these websites increase the more these websites get used by other participants (a feature that is inherent to platforms, like employment websites, that operate in multi-sided markets), <b>Craigslist’s</b> entry rendered these websites less useful to their potential users by reducing their online traffic. 3 [...]...|$|R
30|$|Second, our {{findings}} contribute to other {{studies on the}} effects of <b>Craigslist’s</b> expansion in the USA. In addition to Kroft and Pope (2014), a study by Seamans and Zhu (2014) is closely related to our paper because of its focus on the effect of <b>Craigslist’s</b> entry on pricing (together with circulation and provision of content) in the market for newspapers. Chan and Ghose (2014) focus on the effect of <b>Craigslist’s</b> entry on new HIV cases, while Gurun and Butler (2012) on the use of slant by local newspapers. Unlike these papers that focus on how the diffusion of the Internet—as represented by entry of an online intermediary—affects activities offline (e.g., decision-making by newspaper, sexual behavior), our study examines <b>Craigslist’s</b> effects on activities online (i.e., online traffic at and pricing by competing online intermediaries).|$|R

Thomas intends to limit the party to the backyard and poolhouse with the house guarded by two young security guards, Everett and Tyler. However, more and more people begin to arrive and the party moves beyond their control and into the house. Thomas questions Costa on how he advertised the party, forcing him to confess that he put ads on <b>Craigslist</b> and on a local radio station, worried that no one would attend.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the film {{originated}} from a suggestion by Michael Ferris Gibson, {{who had made the}} 2005 documentary 24 Hours on <b>Craigslist.</b> Gibson, a producer on the film, met with co-director Nic Hill. Gibson financed Hill's travels while making the film. The working title for the film was Truth in Numbers: The Wikipedia Story. Gibson chose to finance the film through a request for funding from Internet visitors; the initial request drew in US$20,000 in initial investment. The production team made their initial work on the project known to Internet viewers via the website www.wikidocumentary.org. Another collaborative website focused on the documentary was formed at Wikia, located at wikidocumentary.wikia.com. Regarding his financing strategy, Gibson commented to the San Francisco Chronicle, that smaller incremental donations from multiple individuals showed genuine interest in his initiative.|$|E

25|$|Following {{continued}} pressure, <b>Craigslist</b> {{removed the}} adult services sections from its U.S. sites in September 2010 and from its international sites in December 2010.

The subpoena sought documents related to the company's processes for reviewing potentially objectionable ads, as well as documents detailing the revenue gained from ads sold to the company's erotic services and adult services categories. In August 2010, Blumenthal called on the website to shut down the section permanently and take steps to eradicate prostitution ads {{from other parts of the}} site. Blumenthal also called on Congress to alter a landmark communications law (Communications Decency Act) that <b>Craigslist</b> has cited in defense of the ads.|$|E

He reportedly exchanged the cash for the car at a Connecticut shopping center parking lot, where he inspected the interior and cargo area (but not the engine) and declined the offer of a bill of sale. He later had the car windows tinted, which made it harder to peer inside. A surveillance tape from the parking lot shows Shahzad test-driving the car, according to the FBI. He bought a second vehicle through <b>Craigslist</b> (a black Isuzu Rodeo) from a mechanic in Stratford, Connecticut.|$|E
