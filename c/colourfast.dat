50|$|In Glasgow, Dale’s {{business}} profile continued to grow. In Dalmarnock {{he set up}} a dyeworks where cloth was dyed with a new, <b>colourfast</b> dye called ‘Turkey Red’ (sometimes known in the city as 'Dale’s Red’). In the centre of town, in what is now Ingram Street, he built a warehouse and small manufactory which produced linen strips or tapes known as ‘incles’ or Scotch Tape. The company traded under the name Dale, Campbell, Reid & Dale. The second Dale here is David Dale’s nephew, also David, and known as David Dale Junior. Still in Glasgow, Dale invested a significant sum in the insurance business. He became a Director of the Glasgow Fire Insurance Company. Despite its name, the company sold life insurance and annuities and had offices in George Street and Wilson Street. Dale also owned a significant amount of land and property in and around the city. Records show at least 18 land and property transactions in his name. These included lands and tenements in the Ramshorn (Ingram Street) area, tenements in Shuttle Street, properties in Barrowfield and Ruchill and a major investment in land and property in the Parkhead area.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} use of drill in uniforms and casual wear {{is in the}} form of khaki. See:Khaki drill. Usually taken to be a sandy or tan colour, the word comes from the Hindustani [...] "khak", meaning the color of dust; a term that became current in mid-19th-century India. In the late 1840s native regiments raised for {{frontier}} service in the newly conquered Punjab were supplied with 'drab' coloured uniforms to make them [...] "invisible in a land of dust." [...] Learning from this practice, British troops took to dyeing their white drill uniforms to obtain more serviceable campaign clothing; a practice that became widespread during the crisis of the Indian Mutiny. Initially, improvised dyes produced clothing that range in shade from lavender grey to earth brown, although all were referred to as 'khaki.' In the mid-1880s standardised cotton drill uniforms were produced using a <b>colourfast</b> mineral dye of the shade now recognised universally as khaki. The fabric soon became a popular material for military uniforms, and, in the United States following World War II, as veterans returned to college campuses, it became popular in casual dress as well.|$|E
5000|$|Richard H. Juve {{joined the}} company in June 1953 and {{introduced}} a line of stabilizing products to push sales in the rubber industry. He was followed by Harvey E. Cooper who joined in 1958 as a chemist from Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. Both men acquired equal shares of The Caldwell Company making them President and Vice President of the company. [...] On September 2, 1959 the first manufacturing plant was opened on Home Ave. in Akron, OH. This {{was the beginning of}} The Caldwell Co. manufacturing its own products. With the change in business operations, The Caldwell Co. quickly changed their name to Americhem Inc. The newly named company began regularly producing their own products in 1960. With funding from issuance of bonds, Americhem was able to develop a number of new commercial products. By the end of 1964, Americhem was manufacturing color concentrates for ABS, many of which were used for the RV industry. In July 1965, Americhem Headquarters was moved to a new building in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. There was also an expansion with manufacturing in 1969 when a new plant was purchased in Medina, OH. Also in 1969, Americhem designed and manufactured the first masterbatches for vinyl siding. This marked the company’s first step into the building products industry. Americhem then {{became a member of the}} Vinyl Siding Institute and helped invent tests along with standards for weathering and durability that are still used today. Americhem was one of the first companies to use IBM System/3 computers and ACS Color Matching computers that were installed in 1972. Then in 1973, they opened their first out of state plant located in Elgin, Illinois. This plant eventually became the new location of the Medina, OH plant. The 1973 oil crisis devastated the automotive industry, which in turn severely affected sales at Americhem. During this time, Americhem gained business in the packaging and construction industries, which led to an upturn in profits. In 1974, partial owner Harvey Cooper retired, leaving ownership of Americhem Inc. to Richard Juve who became majority owner. [...] In 1978, Americhem reached a milestone when opening their first research department. The new laboratory led to the production of Americhem’s first color concentrates for synthetic fibers in response to the new developments of nylon and polyester dispersion technology. In 1987, Americhem received “Best Technical Paper” for the presentation “Weathering Metamerism: A Photochemical Process” and again in 1988 for “Refractive Index: A Key to Understanding Color Difference.” Around the same time, Americhem purchased <b>Colourfast</b> Plastics Ltd. in England to expand their international presence. Then, in order to be strategically located in the heart of the textile industry, Americhem opened a plant in Concord, North Carolina in 1989. Americhem opened a new plant on Steels Corners Road in Cuyahoga Falls, OH in 1998” In 2001, Americhem introduced a polyester solution dye product line for automotive interiors which still continues to be an excellent market that the company excels in. A plant was opened in 2002 located in the carpet capital of the world, Dalton, Georgia. Americhem continued to expand internationally with the establishment of the Luxembourg sales office in 2003, the Mexico City sales office in 2004, and the Suzhou, China plant that opened in 2006 and was expanded in 2014. [...] In the early 2000s, Americhem introduced the first variegated wood grain products for composite deck board applications in 2005, an outdoor color line for polyester fibers, and a low heat build-up technology for dark construction colors in 2006.In 2007, a new company logo and brand were introduced to the market. This included a reimagining of the traditional logo and new company colors: navy blue and sage green.|$|E
40|$|Mobile devices offer {{many new}} avenues for {{computer}} vision {{and in particular}} mobile augmented reality applications {{that have not been}} feasible with desktop computers. The motivation for this research is to improve mobile augmented reality applications so that natural features, instead of fiducial markers or pure location knowledge, can be used as anchor points for virtual mobile augmented reality models within the constraints imposed by current mobile technologies. This research focuses on the feasibility of GPU-based image analysis on current smart phone platforms. In particular it develops new GPU accelerated natural feature algorithms for object detection and tracking techniques on mobiles. The thesis introduces <b>ColourFAST</b> features which contain a compact feature vector of colour change values and an orientation for each feature point. The feature algorithms presented in this thesis process information in “real time”, with the objective on high data throughputs, whilst still maintaining suitable accuracy and correctness. It compares these new algorithms with well-known existing techniques as well as against their modified GPU-based equivalents. The research also develops a new GPU-based feature discovery algorithm for finding more feature points on an object, forming a cluster, which can be collectively used to track the object and improve tracking accuracy. It looks at clustering algorithms for tracking multiple objects and implements an elementary GPU-based object recognition algorithm using the generated <b>ColourFAST</b> feature data...|$|E
40|$|<b>ColourFAST</b> is an {{alternative}} technique to FAST developed by Ensor and Hall used to extract feature point descriptors from an image based on colour change values. The extracted descriptor is compact and, therefore, efficient to compute and match. The purpose of this thesis is to extend the Colour-FAST feature descriptor from a 4 -dimensional vector to a 6 -dimensional vector to improve feature point matching accuracy. This is achieved by incorporating spatial locality to gain {{a sense of the}} shape of an object alongside its colour change information. The main focus is designing, developing and testing feature point matching algorithms specifically architected for the GPU pipeline with an emphasis on accuracy while maintaining high throughput...|$|E
30|$|Lichen {{components}} {{related to}} orcein {{were identified in}} all purple-coloured samples except in patterns 374 and 439 where no dye components were detected. Samples from patterns 4, 435, 437, and 446 also contain indigotin, present in indigo plants or woad. In addition, possibly due to cross contamination, the sample from pattern 435 contained traces of morin, present in old fustic. Since we confirmed the presence of morin in numerous green samples, we believe its presence in purple 435 may {{be a result of}} contamination by handling of the pattern book after manufacture (for example, the yellow in pattern 447 on the same page contains morin). Finding indigo and/or lichen components, such as orcein was expected: during the eighteenth century English dyers obtained their purples either by using blue and red dyes like indigo and madder, or from less <b>colourfast</b> lichens.|$|E
40|$|Nigerian textile and {{clothing}} industries is face with crisis {{under the pressure}} of influx of smuggled second-h{{and clothing}} and cheap and poor quality of Chinese textiles. The situation has resulted to closure of many textile industries and massive unemployment with inability of the few existing industries to compete favourably base on price. The study was carried out in Abeokuta among tie-dye/batik practitioners and consumers of tie-dye/batik products with the aim to examine the challenges facing the resist dyeing industries. The research method is divided into three: Theoretical- this involves using secondary data from books, journal, newspaper, and the web to gather background information; Statistical- this involves the use of questionnaire to gather primary data. The data collected was analysed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Scientist); and Visual- this entails the use of images to establish facts and make judgement {{on the basis of the}} facts discovered. The findings revealed that the challenges facing the practitioners are multi-facet ranging from poor educational status, lack of adequate training/re-training programmes, poor financial status, low customers’ patronage, poor management and marketing skill, lack of adequate and functional social amenities, low purchasing power of consumers who often buy on credit and pay on instalment (some don’t bother to pay their debt), increased competition from smugglers of second-hand clothing and imported Chinese textiles, poor/ no knowledge of information technology, low access to international/ overseas markets and minimal willingness to take risk. Consumers of tie-dye/batik are pertinent to the study. The findings from the consumers shows that about half of the consumers interviewed cannot afford to buy clothes monthly while slightly more than half buy clothes on credit and pay on instalment. The industry has being affected with change in taste of consumers, consequently one third of the consumers do not patronise tie-dye/batik fabrics. Consumers pointed out that tie-dye/batik fabrics are not <b>colourfast</b> and the designs are too common (frequently seen). Consumers also complained of poor customers services of the practitioners. Base on the findings, the study proposes holistic approach to the challenges. A sustainable model of five major pillars (Continuous innovation, Customer Relationship Management, Government Policy Support, Networking and Practitioners Personal Capacity Development) is proposed. Absence of any of the pillar will result to sustainability collapse of tie-dye/batik industry. Other model being proposed include establishment of an Export Centre with an effective and efficient two way communication model; EVIPI an acronym of English words to stimulate innovative entrepreneurial drive in niche marketing, a model for internal secondhand clothing to revisit the pass me down clothing culture among the Yoruba and a networking model to complement each other for development.

40|$|The colour purple evokes an inestimable, priceless luxury in our understanding. It almost {{belongs in}} a legendary world {{along with other}} {{exquisite}} goods. Purple is seen as example par excellence for a symbol of social status, a token of prestige. A significant study {{on the importance of}} purple has brought to light the persistent desire for this colour throughout the Greek and Roman world. 2 Literary sources from Roman times provide us quite comprehensive information on the colour and its sources. The most often quoted author is doubtlessly Caius Plinius Secundus, known as Pliny the Elder, who compiled specialist knowledge in 37 books on various topics. In the chapter on sea animals of his Naturalis Historia Pliny covers shellfish, amongst them the purple snails (Plin. NH 9. 124 – 141). At this point Pliny gives a description of the purple dyestuff obtained from the animal and describes the dyeing process (Plin. NH 9. 133 – 135). His excursus is the most detailed ancient description of the dyeing method with mollusc-purple upon which modern experiments in dyeing are based. 3 However, the actual reason, why Pliny describes purple dyeing, is not that he is interested in dyeing fabrics in the first place. He describes maritime creatures, in particular the sea snails, and as such he pays some tribute to its characteristic feature: the <b>colourfast</b> dyestuff purple. The Roman author Vitruvius and his work De architectura provides further information. Unlike Pliny, Vitruvius focuses on colours used as pigments for painting (decorae picturae, as in Vitr. De arch. 7. 13 – 14). Already in his description diverse terms for ‘purple’ are used and it shows quite obviously, that different kinds of purple were produced, even from various species of molluscs. 1. Incipiam nunc de ostro dicere, quod et carissimam et excellentissimam habet praeter hos colores aspectus suavitatem. Id autem excipitur e conchylio marino, e quo purpura efficitur, cuius non minores sunt quam ceterarum naturae considerantibus admirationes, quod habet non in omnibus locis, quibus nascitur, unius generis colorem, sed solis cursu naturaliter temperatur. 2. Itaque quod lexitur Ponto et Gallia, quod hae regiones sunt proximae ad septentrionem, est atrum; progredientibus inter septentrionem et occidentem invenitur lividum; quod autem legitur ad aequinoctialem orientem et occidentem, invenitur violacio colore; quod vero meridianis regionibus excipitur, rubra procreatur potestate, et ideo hoc Rhodo etiam insula creatur ceterisque eiusmodi regionibus, quae proximae sunt solis cursui. 3.
