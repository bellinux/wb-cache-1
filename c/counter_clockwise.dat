Although cyclones can take an enormous toll in lives and personal property, they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they impact, as they may bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions.

5|$|Weather systems {{affecting}} Newfoundland usually {{originate from}} the west, over mainland Canada, {{or from the}} southwest, from {{the east coast of}} the United States. Cyclonic storms consist of an area of low atmospheric pressure characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate <b>counter</b> <b>clockwise</b> in the northern hemisphere. Such storms passing to the south of the island bring strong northeasterly winds sweeping in off the open North Atlantic Ocean. These storms are sometimes referred to as Nor'easters and are responsible for the worst of Newfoundland's weather. High winds sweeping over a large surface of ocean can build up very large waves. The frequency and severity of storms is greatest between November and March, although they may occur at any time of the year.|$|E

Its symbolism for motion and sun may be from shared prehistoric cultural roots, according to Norman McClelland.|$|E

40|$|Three rock {{units from}} {{southern}} Nova Scotia were sampled for a paleomagnetic {{study of the}} relationship of the Meguma terrane to the Atlantic-bordering continents during the Paleozoic. These include the Siluro-Ordovician White Rock Formation volcanics, sandstones of the Lower Devonian Torbrook Formation and red beds of the Lower Carboniferous Cheverie Formation. Progressive thermal and alternating field demagnetization of the White Rock basalts and rhyolites reveal a single component magnetization with a mean direction of D = 149. 1 °, I = 24. 3 °, α₉₅ = 10 °, for N = 13 sites. Rotation of the site mean directions about the axis of the Torbrook Syncline suggest a post-folding (post Middle Devonian) age for this magnetization, which corresponds to a pole at 21. 9 ° N Lat., 147. 7 ° E Long. after correction for post-Triassic regional tilting. The magnetization of the Torbrook Formation (D = 15. 8 °, I = 29. 6 °, a 95 = 11. 7 °) is clearly a secondary magnetization whose pole (55. 5 ° N Lat., 90. 7 ° E. Long.) lies near Triassic poles from both North America and southern Nova Scotia. The age of the Cheverie Formation magnetization (D = 146 °, I = 25 °, α₉₅ = 6 °, tilt corrected) appears to pre-date folding in the area (pre-Westphalian) and the corresponding pole (24 ° N Lat., 152 ° E Long.) lies near to the White Rock pole, suggesting a similar age of magnetization. The White Rock and Cheverie poles, which are constrained to have Early Carboniferous ages, are 30 ° or more away from the North American APW path over the same age range, a discrepancy which can be explained by a 15 - 19 ° northward motion of Meguma with respect to the North American craton along with a 20 - 25 ° <b>counter</b> - <b>clockwise</b> rotation. There is no paleolatitude discrepancy between these results and paleomagnetic results from the adjacent Avalon Zone although a similar rotational discrepancy is evident.

Spinning is a popular style in Asia, especially Taiwan, where lanes are usually oiled from the foul line to the pin rack, and present little to no opportunity for a ball thrown {{in one of the}} three more orthodox fashions to find friction on any part of the lane.

The angle χ is also significant in that the latitude (angle from the equator) of the polarization state as represented on the Poincaré sphere (see below) is equal to ±2χ. The special cases of linear and circular polarization correspond to an ellipticity ε of infinity and unity (or χ of zero and 45°) respectively.|$|E

2500|$|A typical {{bowling ball}} is {{designed}} to roll vertically, and the core is naturally lop-sided so that the ball will hook naturally if the thumb and finger holes are drilled in the proper places. In parts of Asia, where oil conditions are more difficult and lanes maintenance is poor, hooking the ball makes bowling more difficult. The [...] "spinner", [...] "helicopter" [...] or [...] "UFO" [...] release is popular. A top spinning bowling ball will slide (rather than roll vertically,) but also spin like a top down the lane, and will always slide straight regardless of the oil pattern applied to the lane. Because of the spin, the ball will take an unconventional path through the pins at impact, creating a domino effect (spinners call it [...] "deflection") pin reaction not normally seen when using more conventional releases. The spin is generated by rotating the hand <b>counter</b> <b>clockwise</b> (right-handed) until the hand {{is on top of}} the ball, the two fingers are in the 12-o'clock position, and the thumb is in the 6-o'clock position. At this point, both the fingers and thumb come out of the ball at the same time. The forearm is also used to create the spin on the ball and push the ball onto the lane. Once on the lane surface, the ball will continue to spin on the X-axis, and slide down the lane. This technique is not seen frequently in world-class competition where oil patterns are more standardized. Spinning is difficult to master, and can even cause injury if not done right. Using a lighter bowling ball (10 to 12 pounds) with a completely rounded core is recommended, along with a conventional grip. Spinning causes results like a weak 5-pin more frequently. Use of the spinner technique is seen more frequently in Taiwan and Hong Kong.|$|E
