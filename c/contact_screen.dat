Hence, this study investigated household <b>contact</b> <b>screening</b> adherence and associated factors among tuberculosis patients in Amhara region, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted from April 10 - June 30, 2013 in five urban districts of Amhara region, where 418 patients receiving treatment at tuberculosis clinic were interviewed. All patients were interviewed using structured and pre-tested questionnaire. Bringing at least one household contact to TB clinic was regarded as adherent to household <b>contacts</b> <b>screening.</b> Bivariate and multiple logistic regressions were used to investigate association. The overall adherence to household <b>contact</b> <b>screening</b> in Amhara region was 33. 7 %. Adherence was higher among Muslims than Christians. Adherence was high if patient took health education from Health Care Worker [AOR: 3. 22, 95 % CI: 1. 88 to 5. 51] and 2. 17 times higher if patient had sufficient knowledge on tuberculosis [AOR: 2. 17, 95 % CI: 1. 29 to 3. 67] during interview.

Therefore, this study designed to evaluate the implementation status of child <b>contact</b> <b>screening</b> and management in the health facilities of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Smear positive TB patients living with children attending daily observed treatment at the TB clinic and health care workers providing service were approached to address the study objective. Structured questionnaires were administered to smear positive index cases living with children whether they were requested to bring children age five year and below for TB screening and to health care providers in HIV, TB and child health clinics to assess their knowledge and practice on <b>contact</b> <b>screening</b> and management. Double data entry and analysis was done using EpiData software 3. 1. In 27 health centres, 688 smear-positive index tuberculosis patients were approached of whom 203 (29. 5 %) reported to have children five years and below in their household. A total of 48 (23. 6 %) index cases had been requested by the health care workers to bring their children for tuberculosis screening and 45 (93. 8 %) had complied with this request.

40|$|In this {{contribution}} edge {{isolation of}} crystalline silicon solar cells by dry etching is described. Dry etching {{has the potential}} to replace wet chemical etching steps in solar cell processing. An innovative atmospheric pressure plasma chemical etching process is introduced and feasibility for dry etching is demonstrated. The atmospheric plasma processing is expected to lead to reduced costs because of reduced wafer breakage rate, reduced chemical waste and reduced handling operation due to in-line processing. A reactive plasma is generated in a linear extended arc jet source operating at atmospheric pressure and used to remove the rear side emitter. The wafers are continuously moved through the reactor, resulting in an in-line process which can be applied between nitride deposition and <b>contact</b> <b>screen</b> printing. Plasma enhanced chemical etching of 125 mm x 125 mm mono-crystalline silicon wafers has been carried out. Different surface morphologies have been observed such as smooth surfaces, pyramids of several micrometers or nano-textured surfaces depending on the etch gas and process conditions. Good shunt resistance values of 14 kOhm cm(exp 2) were achieved. Industrial trials result in cell efficiencies being equivalent to the wet chemical reference process...|$|E

This involved the whole process of the developing of the cells, thus&# 13; annealing process is one of the important steps that needs to be optimised. Approach: Only Si solar&# 13; cells will be discussed and the processes involved would be metal <b>contact</b> <b>screen</b> printing and metal&# 13; paste co-firing. The contacts were first screen printed with Al paste for the rear side and Ag paste for&# 13; the front side of the cell.

Results: After the IV characteristics&# 13; were measured such as Voc, Isc, Pmax and fill factor, it shows that when higher annealing temperature&# 13; of the profile was used, all the parameter will increase accordingly.

OBJECTIVES: To quantify 2 -year TB risk and evaluate screening performance with single-step QuantiFERON TB Gold-In Tube (QFT) in adult contacts. To compare TB risk between QFT tested subgroups stratified by exposure type (smear positive pulmonary (SP) versus non-smear positive (NSP) TB) and age (younger (16 - 35 years) versus older (≥ 36 years)). METHODS: Screening involved QFT testing in older contacts of SP and all younger contacts, 8 - 12 weeks after index notification. Chemoprevention (3 RH) was offered to QFT positive (+) younger adults. TB risk was determined in a prospective cohort study. RESULTS: 43 TB events occurred in 1769 adult contacts observed for median 717 days (2 -year rate (95 % CI) = 2 · 5 % (1. 7 to 3. 2)). Index-contact strain matching was demonstrable for 18 of 22 (82 %) paired samples. No contacts (0 / 98) receiving 3 RH developed TB. 215 of 817 appropriately tested adults (26. 3 %) were QFT+. 14 of 112 untreated QFT+ adults developed TB (2 -year rate (95 % CI) = 13 · 4 % (7. 7 to 21. 1)). The model required 35 <b>contacts</b> <b>screened</b> with QFT to identify one contact developing TB at 2 years. TB rates were comparable in QFT+ contacts of SP and NSP (rate ratio (RR) = 0. 98, p= 0 · 962). For QFT+ older contacts, the disease rate was lower (8. 9 % (3. 3 to 19. 1)) and similar to the overall group rate (RR= 1. 4, p= 0. 503).

40|$|Evidence {{that informs}} the {{rationale}} for screening {{of children who are}} close contacts of a case of tuberculosis and for providing preventive therapy for this high-risk group has been available for> 50 years [1, 2]. The policy is almost universally accepted, being included in global and almost all national tuberculosis control program guidelines [3]. However, in practice it is rarely implement-ed except in low-tuberculosis-burden, re-source-rich settings [4]. <b>Contact</b> <b>screening</b> has 2 main roles. One is to identify at-risk contacts such as young or human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) –infected children who require preventive therapy. The othe...|$|R

40|$|T cell {{interferon}} gamma release assays (IGRAs) {{have been developed}} as blood tests with excellent specificity for diagnosing latent TB. They are now recommended by American and European guidelines for <b>contact</b> <b>screening.</b> Extending the use of IGRAs to the diagnosis of active TB, especially TB pleuritis, has attracted considerable interests. During active TB, sensitized T cells migrate to the site(s) of infection {{where they can be}} compart-mentalized. Concentrations of T lymphocytes can be significantly higher in pleural fluid than blood in patients with TB pleuritis. Recent studies that applied IGRAs to pleural fluid in the setting of TB pleuritis (table 1) have shown dichotomous results. In low TB prevalence settings 1,...|$|R

Passive case-finding is widely practised: we wanted to ascertain the consensus and possible improvements in active case-finding across Europe. Recommendations from national guidelines were collected from 50 countries of the WHO-European Region using a standard questionnaire. <b>Contacts</b> are universally <b>screened</b> for active tuberculosis and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Most countries (> 70 %) screen those with HIV-infection, prisoners and inpatient <b>contacts.</b> <b>Screening</b> of immigrants is related to their contribution to national rates of tuberculosis. Only 25 / 50 (50 %) advise a request for symptoms in their guidelines. 36 / 50 (72 %) countries recommend sputum examination for those with a persistent cough; 13 countries do not, even if the chest radiograph suggests tuberculosis. Nearly all countries (49 / 50) use tuberculin skin testing (TST); 27 / 50 (54 %) countries also perform chest radiography irrespective of the TST result. Interpretation of the TST varies widely.
