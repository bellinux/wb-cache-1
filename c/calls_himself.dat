25|$|In late 17th-century England, a {{homeless}} boy named Gwynplaine rescues an infant girl during a snowstorm, her mother having frozen to death whilst feeding her. They meet an itinerant carnival vendor who <b>calls</b> <b>himself</b> Ursus, and his pet wolf, Homo. Gwynplaine's mouth has been mutilated into a perpetual grin; Ursus is initially horrified, {{then moved to}} pity, and he takes them in. Fifteen years later, Gwynplaine {{has grown into a}} strong young man, attractive except for his distorted visage. The girl, now named Dea, is blind, and has grown into a beautiful and innocent young woman. By touching his face, Dea concludes that Gwynplaine is perpetually happy. They fall in love. Ursus and his surrogate children earn a meagre living in the fairs of southern England. Gwynplaine keeps the lower half of his face concealed. In each town, Gwynplaine gives a stage performance in which the crowds are provoked to laughter when Gwynplaine reveals his grotesque face.|$|E
25|$|Along the {{way they}} find Patrick Danville, a young man imprisoned by someone who <b>calls</b> <b>himself</b> Joe Collins but is really a psychic vampire named Dandelo. Dandelo feeds off the {{emotions}} of his victims, and starts to feed off of Roland and Susannah by telling them jokes. Roland and Susannah are alerted to the danger by Stephen King, who drops clues directly into the book, enabling them to defeat the vampire. They discover Patrick in the basement, and find that Dandelo had removed his tongue. Patrick is freed and soon his special talent becomes evident: his drawings and paintings become reality. As their travels bring them nearer to the Dark Tower, Susannah comes {{to the conclusion that}} Roland needs to complete his journey without her. Susannah asks Patrick to draw a door she has seen in her dreams to lead her out of this world. He does so and once it appears, Susannah says goodbye to Roland and crosses over to another world.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{recourse}} to biblical language, Leo also describes his own {{special relationship with}} St Peter in terms derived from Roman law. He <b>calls</b> <b>himself</b> the (unworthy) heir and deputy (vicarius) of Peter, having received his apostolic authority and being obliged to follow his example. On the one hand, Peter stands before him with a claim on how Leo is to exercise his office; on the other hand, Leo, as the Roman bishop, represents the Apostle, whose authority he holds. Christ, however, always comes out {{as the source of}} all grace and authority, and Leo is responsible to him for how he fulfills his duties (sermon 1). Peter is indeed the example for Leo's relationship to Christ. Thus, the office of the Roman bishop, with its universal significance, is grounded on the special relationship between Christ and St Peter, a relationship that cannot be repeated per se; therefore, Leo depends on St Peter's mediation, his assistance and his example {{in order to be able}} to adequately fulfill his role and exercise his authority as the Bishop of Rome, both in the city and beyond.|$|E

25|$|The Pequod is now heading {{southeast}} toward Moby Dick. A man falls overboard {{from the}} mast. The life buoy is thrown, but both sink. Now Queequeg proposes that his superfluous coffin {{be used as}} a new life buoy. Starbuck orders the carpenter take care it is lidded and caulked. Next morning, the ship meets in another truncated gam with the Rachel, commanded by Captain Gardiner from Nantucket. The Rachel is seeking survivors from one of her whaleboats which had gone after Moby Dick. Among the missing is Gardiner's young son. Ahab refuses to join the search. Twenty-four hours a day, Ahab now stands and walks the deck, while Fedallah shadows him. Suddenly, a sea hawk grabs Ahab's slouched hat and flies off with it. Next, the Pequod, in a ninth and final gam, meets the Delight, badly damaged and with five of her crew left dead by Moby Dick. Her captain shouts that the harpoon which can kill the white whale has yet to be forged, but Ahab flourishes his special lance and once more orders the ship forward. Ahab shares a moment of contemplation with Starbuck. Ahab speaks about his wife and child, <b>calls</b> <b>himself</b> a fool for spending 40 years on whaling, and claims he can see his own child in Starbuck's eye. Starbuck tries to persuade Ahab to return to Nantucket to meet both their families, but Ahab simply crosses the deck and stands near Fedallah.|$|E
25|$|Since Korellian law forbids Foundation missionaries {{to be on}} {{the planet}} under penalty of death, the crew determines that the Reverend Jord Parma of Anacreon (as he <b>calls</b> <b>himself)</b> had been {{captured}} by the Korellians but managed to escape before being killed. Rev. Parma is injured, apparently mentally confused, and in need of hospitalization. A short time after Parma has been aboard the ship, an angry mob appears, surrounding the Far Star, and demanding that the missionary be turned over to them as an escaped criminal. This rapid response by the Korellians in what is an extremely remote location arouses Mallow's suspicions: Where did Parma actually escape from? Why was there a mob seemingly already gathered in the middle of nowhere? And how were they able to pinpoint the location of the Far Star and surround it so promptly after Parma boarded the ship? Suspecting a set-up, rather than fight the mob, Mallow decides to turn the missionary over to them (and to certain death), despite Twer's frantic attempt to intervene. Soon afterwards, Mallow is invited to meet with Korell's authoritarian ruler, Commdor ("First Citizen Of The State") Asper Argo, indicating that Mallow had apparently passed a test by the Korellians by showing respect for their laws. Argo appears friendly and welcomes Foundation technological gifts; however, he refuses to allow Scientism on Korell, and Mallow agrees not to encourage missionary work in the Republic.|$|E
25|$|Back at Han's {{funeral in}} Los Angeles, Dom notices a car observing them, {{and after a}} chase, confronts its driver, who is {{revealed}} to be Shaw. Both prepare to fight, but Shaw flees when a covert ops team arrives and opens fire, led by Frank Petty, a man who <b>calls</b> <b>himself</b> Mr. Nobody. Petty says that he will assist Dom in stopping Shaw if he helps him obtain God's Eye, a computer program that uses digital devices to track down a person, and save its creator, a hacker named Ramsey, from a mercenary named Mose Jakande. Dom, Brian, Letty, Roman Pearce, and Tej Parker then airdrop their cars over the Caucasus Mountains in Azerbaijan, ambush Jakande's convoy, and rescue Ramsey. The team then heads to Abu Dhabi, where a billionaire has acquired the flash drive containing God's Eye, and manages to steal it from the owner. With God's Eye near telecommunications repeaters, the team tracks down Shaw, who is waiting at a remote factory. Dom, Brian, Petty and his team attempt to capture Shaw, but are ambushed by Jakande and his men and forced to flee while Jakande obtains God's Eye. At his own request, the injured Petty is then left behind to be evacuated by helicopter while Brian and Dom continue without him. To reduce their disadvantage, the crew returns to Los Angeles to fight Shaw, Jakande and his men. Meanwhile, Brian promises Mia that once they deal with Shaw, he will retire and fully dedicate himself to their family.|$|E

25|$|Six {{books in}} elegiacs survive of this second ambitious poem that Ovid {{was working on}} when he was exiled. The six books cover the first {{semester}} of the year, with each book dedicated to a different month of the Roman calendar (January to June). The project seems unprecedented in Roman literature. It seems that Ovid planned to cover the whole year, {{but was unable to}} finish because of his exile, although he did revise sections of the work at Tomis, and he claims at Trist. 2.549–52 that his work was interrupted after six books. Like the Metamorphoses, the Fasti was to be a long poem and emulated aetiological poetry by writers like Callimachus and, more recently, Propertius and his fourth book. The poem goes through the Roman calendar, explaining the origins and customs of important Roman festivals, digressing on mythical stories, and giving astronomical and agricultural information appropriate to the season. The poem was probably dedicated to Augustus initially, but perhaps the death of the emperor prompted Ovid to change the dedication to honor Germanicus. Ovid uses direct inquiry of gods and scholarly research to talk about the calendar and regularly <b>calls</b> <b>himself</b> a vates, a priest. He also seems to emphasize unsavory, popular traditions of the festivals, imbuing the poem with a popular, plebeian flavor, which some have interpreted as subversive to the Augustan moral legislation. While this poem has always been invaluable to students of Roman religion and culture for the wealth of antiquarian material it preserves, it recently has been seen as one of Ovid's finest literary works and a unique contribution to Roman elegiac poetry.|$|E
25|$|Before the New 52, the Trident, {{granted by}} Poseidon to the {{rightful}} ruler and {{protector of the}} seas, was indestructible and a very powerful melee weapon, able to destroy the very powerful Imperiex Probes for instance, which Aquaman wielded with unmatched skill. Apart from its power as a melee weapon, the Trident also {{had the power to}} manipulate water, fire bolts of powerful energy and act as a focus to amplify the magical power of others, most notably Tempest. In the New 52, the Trident is now part of a collection of seven very powerful Atlantean magical items, forged by the first king of Atlantis who <b>calls</b> <b>himself</b> 'The Dead King'. Thought to be the most powerful weapon of the set, {{with the possible exception of}} the recently discovered seventh item, the Trident is completely indestructible and able to hurt even the most powerful of opponents, such as the evil god Darkseid, with Aquaman being the only leaguer to puncture and make him bleed out. He was also able to break the mystical barrier of Dr. Graves which was deemed indestructible at the time. In one instance, the Trident was shown glowing with magical power when Black Manta used the rest of the items to discover the hidden seventh one. For a time, Aquaman withheld the Trident of said aforementioned god of the oceans in his battles against the Thule and Rao's disciples, which gave him the power to summon tsunamis and deluges, call down thunder and lighting, project and control ice, move the earth making it rise and tremble at his command, as well as teleport himself from global to interplanetary distances using water as a medium. It could also transform into a gladius and back at will. Arthur also uses both versions of the trident to boost the range his telepathy.|$|E
