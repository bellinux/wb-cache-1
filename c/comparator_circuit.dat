50|$|The {{successive}} approximation register is initialized so that the most significant bit (MSB) is equal to a digital 1. This code is fed into the DAC, which then supplies the analog equivalent of this digital code (Vref/2) into the <b>comparator</b> <b>circuit</b> for comparison with the sampled input voltage. If this analog voltage exceeds Vin the comparator causes the SAR to reset this bit; otherwise, the bit is left a 1. Then the next bit is set to 1 and the same test is done, continuing this binary search until every bit in the SAR has been tested.

5000|$|In theory, a {{standard}} op-amp operating in open-loop configuration (without negative feedback) {{may be used}} as a low-performance comparator. When the non-inverting input (V+) is at a higher voltage than the inverting input (V-), the high gain of the op-amp causes the output to saturate at the highest positive voltage it can output. When the non-inverting input (V+) drops below the inverting input (V-), the output saturates at the most negative voltage it can output. The op-amp's output voltage is limited by the supply voltage.

Among the stable matchings, there is one in which each woman gets the best man that she ever gets in any stable matching; this is known as the woman-optimal stable matching. The decision version of the stable matching problem is, given the rankings of all men and women, whether a given man and a given woman are matched in the woman-optimal stable matching.

5000|$|In electronics, a Schmitt trigger is a <b>comparator</b> <b>circuit</b> with {{hysteresis}} {{implemented by}} applying positive {{feedback to the}} noninverting input of a comparator or differential amplifier. It is an active circuit which converts an analog input signal to a digital output signal. The circuit is named a [...] "trigger" [...] because the output retains its value until the input changes sufficiently to trigger a change. In the non-inverting configuration, when the input is higher than a chosen threshold, the output is high. When the input is below a different (lower) chosen threshold the output is low, and when the input is between the two levels the output retains its value. This dual threshold action is called hysteresis and implies that the Schmitt trigger possesses memory and {{can act as a}} bistable multivibrator (latch or flip-flop). There is a close relation between the two kinds of circuits: a Schmitt trigger can be converted into a latch and a latch can be converted into a Schmitt trigger.|$|E

50|$|The charge-transfer {{amplifier}} (CTA) is {{an electronic}} amplifier circuit.

They consume zero static power and can be designed to consume (theoretically) arbitrarily low dynamic power, proportional to the size of input signals being sampled. CMOS technology is most commonly used for implementation. CTAs were introduced in memory circuits in the 1970s, and more recently have been applied in multi-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).
