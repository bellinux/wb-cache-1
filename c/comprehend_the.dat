He is unable to <b>comprehend</b> <b>the</b> subtleties and complexities that underlie Criseyde's vacillations and Pandarus' manoeuvrings.|$|E

They did not see that capital could not pay wages, buy raw {{material}} and manufacture goods unless it could sell its products and get returns. And if a few more intelligent did see these things the pressure of hungry wives and children obscured all reason and they were ready to go along on anything that offered a shadow of relief.|$|E
5|$|Although {{short fiction}} had been popular {{as far back}} as the Tang dynasty (618–907), and the works of {{contemporaneous}} authors such as Xu Guangqi, Xu Xiake, and Song Yingxing were often technical and encyclopedic, the most striking literary development was the vernacular novel. While the gentry elite were educated enough to fully <b>comprehend</b> <b>the</b> language of Classical Chinese, those with rudimentary education – such as women in educated families, merchants, and shop clerks – became a large potential audience for literature and performing arts that employed Vernacular Chinese. Literati scholars edited or developed major Chinese novels into mature form in this period, such as Water Margin and Journey to the West. Jin Ping Mei, published in 1610, although incorporating earlier material, marks the trend toward independent composition and concern with psychology. In the later years of the dynasty, Feng Menglong and Ling Mengchu innovated with vernacular short fiction. Theater scripts were equally imaginative. The most famous, The Peony Pavilion, was written by Tang Xianzu (1550–1616), with its first performance at the Pavilion of Prince Teng in 1598.|$|E

25|$|In higher education, {{linguistic}} profiling {{has been found}} to impede student comprehension. In a 1992 study, D.

When the same non-accented lecture was presented with a European American teaching assistant, students had a greater ability to <b>comprehend</b> <b>the</b> material. This suggests that face identification may be enough to make students believe that language performance will be accented, which corresponded with a belief that comprehension would be reduced.|$|E
