40|$|The {{effect of}} a range of {{constant}} temperatures (10 - 35 °C) on the germination of Cucurbita pepo var. styriaca seed was investigated to quantify the relationship between temperature and the rate of seed germination and to study the effect of conditioning temperature on the relationship. Seeds were conditioned on moist filter paper either at 25 or 20 °C for 14 days in an incubator. No seeds of C. pepo <b>conditioned</b> <b>at</b> 25 °C, germinated at 35 °C within 312 h. For seeds <b>conditioned</b> <b>at</b> 20 °C, germination occurred at temperatures between 15 and 5 °C within 312 h. The base (Tb, estimated from extrapolation), optimum (To) and ceiling (Tc) temperatures determined were: Tb = 17. 6 °C, To = 28 °C and Tc> 35 °C for seeds <b>conditioned</b> <b>at</b> 20 °C compared with Tb = 13. 7 °C, To = 25 - 27. 5 °C and Tc> 35 °C for seeds <b>conditioned</b> <b>at</b> 25 °C. Positive linear relationships were established between the rates (reciprocal of time taken) of germination of 90 % of the final germination percentage and temperature up to the respective optimal temperatures. The rate of germination for seed <b>conditioned</b> <b>at</b> 20 °C was lower than for seed <b>conditioned</b> <b>at</b> 25 °C. Similarly base and optimum temperatures were lower for seed <b>conditioned</b> <b>at</b> 25 °C...|$|R

However, further analysis of the work site showed that dozens of construction-related injuries had occurred at the site during the construction of One World Trade Center, including 34 not reported to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

5|$|A race riot {{broke out}} in May 1943 of whites against blacks. ADDSCO {{management}} had long maintained segregated <b>conditions</b> <b>at</b> the shipyards, although the Roosevelt administration had ordered defense contractors to integrate facilities. That year ADDSCO promoted 12 blacks to positions as welders, previously reserved for whites; and whites objected to the change by rioting on May 24. The mayor appealed to the governor to call in the National Guard to restore order, but it was weeks before officials allowed African Americans to return to work, keeping them away for their safety.|$|E
