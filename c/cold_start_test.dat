40|$|Copyright © 2004 SAE International A major {{manufacturer}} of small engines has recently implemented cold and hot start {{tests on the}} assembly lines {{of one of its}} engines. The <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> <b>test</b> refers to the test in which the engine is motored for a short time. Since this is a motored test, with no combustion occurring in the cylinder, the objective of this test is the detection of manufacturing and assembly defects. Next the engine undergoes a hot start test, in which fuel and air are supplied and the engine is started under a predefined load condition. This is a test performed to verify the performance of the engine under the application conditions. In both tests, typically multiple parameters are measured and extracted to assess the mechanical and thermal performance of the engine. Since noise level and sound quality of small engines have become major concerns for application manufacturers and end-users, an investigation was performed to assess the feasibility of including NVH parameters in the test criteria. Furthermore, some of the NVH parameters can be used to improve and refine the detection of mechanical defects in the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> <b>test</b> and to detect abnormal combustion phenomena (knock, misfire) in the hot start test. This paper will describe the process and the tools used in the investigation along with all testing, signal processing and correlation methods. Conclusions related to the usefulness and feasibility of NVH parameters and to the efficiency of the test stands will also be presented...|$|E

It {{is characterized by}} a reduced power per area ratio, relative to previous designs, and includes several improvements to run the whole system safely in a car. The new reactor design includes a concentric inner high voltage electrode, a grounded outer electrode, a shielded high-voltage and high temperature resistant electrical connection. A generator controller has been developed for better control of operating conditions as required during the engine cold start phase. The new generator/reactor system was installed in the exhaust pipe of a gasoline direct injection engine.

40|$|SLIM® {{transformers}} are compact liquid-immersed transformers {{according to}} IEC 60076 - 14 and customised for typical {{applications such as}} on- and off-shore wind turbines. State of the art SLIM® wind turbine generator transformers (WTGT) have to operate in wind farms which are often located in remote locations with harsh conditions and sometime very low temperatures. After {{a few days of}} no wind the transformer can be cooled down to - 30 °C or even - 40 °C so these conditions need to be tested in advance. To ensure the reliability of CG Power System Belgium’s WTGT’s and the possibility to start in cold conditions, several tests were conducted in OWI-Lab’s large climatic test chamber. OWI-Lab’s test facility is the first public test centre in Europe that deals with extreme climatic tests of heavy machinery applications up to 150 tonnes with a special focus on wind turbine components. CG wants to prove that when WTGT’s have to operate in cold conditions, the internal cooling is still working properly. Due to higher viscosity at low temperature of the used cooling liquids, the natural convection cooling of the internal windings may be limited. According to the properties of the cooling liquid that is used inside the WTGT, it remains ‘liquid’ above - 45 °C (pour point), but due to the high viscosity, the natural convection may be limited and {{there is a possibility that}} the initial losses generated inside the transformers’ windings cannot be evacuated fast enough. To verify if the natural convection starts, a full load <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> <b>test</b> was conducted at - 30 °C to prove that the natural cooling of the internal windings starts immediately. During the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> <b>test</b> the internal pressure and several temperatures such as the top oil were measured. Also a storage test was done at - 40 ºC to check if the transformer can resist this ambient temperature. This storage test was conducted to prove that no leaks or other visual issues occurred on the tank and gaskets...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of ambient temperature on exhaust emissions for an instrumented Euro 1 SI car was determined for urban congested traffic conditions. In UK cities cold-starting vehicles directly into congested traffic conditions {{is a common}} occurrence that is not currently taken into account when modeling urban traffic pollution. In-vehicle emission samples were taken directly from the exhaust, upstream and downstream of the catalyst, using the bag sampling technique. The first bag was for the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> emissions and approximately the first 1. 1 km of travel. The following three bags were with a hotter catalyst. The <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted over a year, with ambient temperatures ranging from 2 °C to 30 °C. The results showed that CO emissions for the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> were reduced by 70 % downstream of the catalyst when the ambient temperature rose from 2 °C to 30 °C. The corresponding hydrocarbon emissions were reduced by 41 % and NOx emissions were increased by 90 %. The {{influence of}} ambient temperature was less when the catalyst was fully warmed up. The results showed that ambient temperature had a greater influence on <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> emission under traffic jam conditions than in previous work with real world driving closer to the ECE passenger car drive cycle...|$|R
40|$|Methanol and ethanol {{are known}} as {{potential}} alcohol alternative fuels for spark ignition Engines, which can be blended with gasoline to increase oxygen content and to decrease emissions. Six kinds of fuels were prepared, they are commercial 93 #gasoline, M 10, M 20, M 30, E 10 and E 20. With a constant volume bomb, flame propagation speeds were studied under different temperatures, exhaust dilution and air fuel ratios. The flame radiuses were {{used to calculate the}} flame speed. The results indicate that methanol can increase flame speed no matter with or without exhaust dilution. At the ambient temperature of 5 ℃ and 15 ℃, engine <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> <b>tests</b> prove that methanol can improve engine combustion and lower HC and CO emissions during the first 200 seconds, while ethanol has little effects at the same conditions...|$|R
40|$|The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) has {{developed}} a dedicated E 85 -fueled Chevrolet Si verado pickup with superior emissions, cold starting, and performance {{when compared to the}} original gasoline-fueled vehicle. All fuel system components not E 85 compatible have been replaced or modified. Ethanol-specific light-off and main catalysts are utilized for emissions reductions, and an experimentally optimized air injection system rapidly heats the catalysts for reduced cold start emissions. Emissions tests have been performed at an EPA certified emissions test facility. Cold starting characteristics are improved by incorporating a high energy multiple spark ignition system, successfully extending the lean flammability limit of E 85. Cold start testing has been performed within a <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> <b>test</b> facility and an experimental procedure has been developed to determine engine start time. There have been no internal engine modifications to maintain fuel flexibility. However, an on-demand strategy utilizing a centrifugal supercharger at high load provides increased performance. Baseline and modified performance measurements have been made using an engine dynamometer. Certain engine control data within the Engine Control Module (ECM) have been modified based on experimentation, although the majority of the stock gasoline control strategy has been retained. To account for differences in fuel characteristics, increased mass flow rate fuel injectors are used. Individual fuel injectors have been calibrated using a newly developed fuel injector testing system, and each injector selected for the conversion provides fuel flow within a specified tolerance. The complete UTEP Challenge experience includes a substantial sponsorship effort, a student developed web page, and an attractive, functional, and consumer acceptable Chevrolet Silverado pickup...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{particulate matter}} emissions from a Ford XLD 4 T, passengercar diesel engine through a practical exhaust {{system in place}} was investigated during transient conditions, namely cold start and fast acceleration. Particulate emissions were measured at four sampling points through the exhaust system and the changes in particulate total mass concentration, total number concentration, particle size distribution and Carbon/SOF fractions were determined for various engine operating conditions. Each <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> <b>test</b> consisted of a step-change cold-start with fast acceleration, reaching {{one of the following}} target operation conditions: Idle, 1500 rpm - 15 kW, 2250 rpm - 15 kW, 2250 rpm- 35 kW and 3500 rpm - 15 kW. Two preconditioning procedures were designed to provide repeatable cold start tests. These consisted of a) Idle operation for 4 hours the day before the test, followed by overnight soak; and b) 10 minutes at high engine speed operation. Fast acceleration tests consisted of idle preconditioning followed by a step change to the target operation conditions. The particulate matter changes through the exhaust system were shown to be dependent on the previous operational history of the engine, idle conditions being effective at forming particle deposits. The amount of particulate deposited or blown out from the exhaust system constituted a significant fraction of the total engine exhaust emissions in a significant number of cold start and acceleration tests. The changes in particle concentration did not occur throughout the system in the same fashion. The catalyst produced predominantly particle number and mass reduction and the second silencer was a more efficient particle collector than the first silencer. From the first silencer, particles were resuspended more easily and in many more cases. Regarding the chemical composition, high-load conditions produced lower Solvent Organic Fraction (SOF) than their low load counterpart. However, the SOF did not change significantly through the exhaust system. Part of this work consisted of examining the use of the Electrical Low Pressure Impactor (ELP 1) to estimate particulate mass emissions. It was observed that the ELP 1 tended to overestimate the number of particles in the large (> 0. 1 (im) size range. This greatly affected the conversion from total particle number concentration to particle mass concentration. A correction based on comparison between the electrical and gravimetric methods (ELPI vs. Andersen Impactors) in the common size range for both techniques was proposed. Transient and steady-state tailpipe emission factors, expressed as grams of particulate per unit of engine work in kWh, were calculated from the test results and used to estimate the effect of transients on total cycle emissions in cycles with a different design from those followed in this work. The ELPI proved to be useful, yet limited for particle collection on Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) grids in several size ranges. TEM images of particles were analysed and their fractal dimension determined...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>start</b> <b>tests</b> {{are carried}} out to {{evaluate}} the performance of copper-exchanged zeolites as hydrocarbon traps under simulated gasoline car exhaust gases, paying {{special attention to the}} role of copper in the performance of these zeolites. It is concluded that the partial substitution of the protons in the parent H-ZSM- 5 zeolite is highly beneficial for hydrocarbon trapping due to the formation of selective adsorption sites with specific affinity for the different exhaust components. However, it is also observed that uncontrolled exchanging process conditions could lead to the presence of CuO nanoparticles in the zeolite surface, which seem to block the pore structure of the zeolite, decreasing the hydrocarbon trap efficiency. Among all the zeolites studied, the results point out that a CuH-ZSM- 5 with a partial substitution of extra-framework protons by copper cations and without any detectable surface CuO nanoparticles is the zeolite that showed the best performance under simulated <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> conditions due to both the high stability and the hydrocarbon retaining capacity of this sample during the consecutive cycles...|$|R
40|$|This study {{involves}} the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> <b>testing</b> of ULSD and JP 8 fuels on the 6 cylinder 7. 2 liter turbocharged diesel engine at various ambient temperatures {{as low as}} 0 oF for JP 8 fuel and 10 oF for ULSD fuel. Cycle by cycle analysis of the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> transient data, along {{with the effects of}} variation in ambient temperature on the engine cranking speed and in cylinder motoring pressure were analyzed and presented. It was found that the reduction in ambient temperature resulted in prolonged cranking periods along with the longer time taken to reach idling speed as well as increased combustion instability. This phenomenon was observed for both ULSD and JP 8 fuels at low ambient temperatures. The engine ECU fueling strategy was studied at ambient temperatures as low as 0 oF and found to be inadequate to result in prompt engine start.

40|$|The {{influence}} of ambient temperature on exhaust emissions for an instrumented Euro 1 SI car was determined. A real world test cycle was used, {{based on an}} urban drive cycle that {{was similar to the}} ECE urban drive cycle. It was based on four laps of a street circuit and an emissions sample bag was taken for each lap. The bag for the first lap was for the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> emissions. An in-vehicle direct exhaust dual bag sampling technique was used to simultaneously collect exhaust samples upstream and downstream of the three-way catalyst (TWC). The <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted over a year, with ambient temperatures ranging from – 2 °C to 32 °C. The exhaust system was instrumented with thermocouples so that the catalyst light off temperature could be determined. The results showed that CO emissions for the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> were reduced by a factor of 8 downstream of catalyst when ambient temperature rose from - 2 °C to 32 °C, the corresponding hydrocarbon emissions were reduced by a factor of 4. There was no clear relationship between NOx emissions and ambient temperature.

Preparations have been completed for testing the fuel in diesel electric generators in Alaska.

The experiments and analyses conducted during this project show that Fischer-Tropsch (FT) gas-to-liquid diesel fuel can easily be used in a diesel engine with little to no modifications. Additionally, based on the results and discussion presented, further improvements in performance and emissions can be realized by configuring the engine to take advantage of FT diesel fuel's properties.

40|$|Increasing {{the number}} of cold-start engine cycles which could be run in any one day would greatly improve the {{productivity}} of an engine test facility. However {{with the introduction of}} forced cooling procedures there is the inherent risk that test-to-test repeatability will be affected. Therefore an investigation into the effects caused by forced cooling on fuel consumption and the temperature distribution through the engine and fluids is essential. Testing was completed on a 2. 4 litre diesel engine running a cold NEDC. The test facility utilises a basic ventilation system, which draws in external ambient air, which is forced past the engine and then drawn out of the cell. This can be supplemented {{with the use of a}} spot cooling fan. The forced cool down resulted in a much quicker cool down which was further reduced with spot cooling, in the region of 25 % reduction. The implementation of forced cooling was found to have a small but repeatable effect on the fuel consumption, around 1 %, and the fluid temperature distribution through the engine.

40|$|Proton {{exchange}} membrane {{fuel cell}} (PEMFC) {{has been considered}} {{as one of the}} most promising energy conversion devices for the future in automotive applications. One of the major technical challenges for the commercialization of PEMFC is the effective start-up from subzero temperatures, often referred to as “cold start”. The major problem of PEMFC <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> is that the product water freezes when the temperature inside the PEMFC is lower than the freezing point. If the catalyst layer (CL) is fully occupied by ice before the cell temperature rises above the freezing point, the electrochemical reaction may stop due to the blockage of the reaction sites. However, only a few of the previous PEMFC studies paid attention to <b>cold</b> <b>start.</b> Hence, understanding the ice formation mechanisms and optimizing the design and operational strategies for PEMFC <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> are critically important. In this research, an experimental setup for the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> <b>testing</b> with simultaneous measurement of current and temperature distributions is designed and built; a one-dimensional (1 D) analytical model for quick estimate of purging durations before the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> processes is formulated; and a comprehensive three-dimensional (3 D) PEMFC <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> model is developed. The unique feature of the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> experiment is the inclusion of the simultaneous measurement of current and temperature distributions. Since most of the previous numerical models are limited to either 1 D or two-dimensional (2 D) or 3 D but only considering a section of the entire cell due to computational requirement, the measured distribution data are critically important to better understand the PEMFC <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> characteristics. With a full set of conservation equations, the 3 D model comprehensively accounts for the various transport phenomena during the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> processes. The unique feature of this model is the inclusion of: (i) the water freezing in the membrane electrolyte and its effects on the membrane conductivity; (ii) the non-equilibrium mass transfer between the water in the ionomer and the water (vapour, liquid and ice) in the pore region of the CL; and (iii) both the water freezing and melting in the CL and gas diffusion layer (GDL). This model therefore provides the fundamental framework for the future top-down multi-dimensional multiphase modelling of PEMFC. The experimental and numerical results elaborate the ice formation mechanisms and other important transport phenomena during the PEMFC <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> processes. The effects of the various cell designs, operating conditions and external heating methods on the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> performance are studied. Independent tests are carried out to identify and optimize the important design and operational parameters...|$|R

40|$|Air quality {{issues in}} urban areas are always a big concern. Air {{pollution}} especially NO 2 and PM exceedances in cities are common. This is particularly true with congested traffic and the monitoring station is at the roadside. It {{is well known that}} road transport in the urban area is a major source of air pollution. Though all the vehicles have to comply the EU emission standards, the emissions were tested using the legislated standard driving cycles, which could not represent real world driving emissions. This is because compared to the legislated driving cycle, the real world driving uses different powers, different average speeds, different traffic congestion, different road gradients, different maximum acceleration rates, different <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> conditions, different numbers of stop/start events and occurs at different ambient temperatures and pressures and will inevitably have different emissions. In recognition of importance of real driving emissions, the EU plans to introduce RDE (Real driving emission) test procedure in 2017. This work investigated real world emissions on a congested road by a roadside air quality monitoring station that exceeds European air quality standards for NOx and PM using a portable emissions measurement system (PEMS) and a Euro 4 SI passenger car. The PEMS used was the Temet FTIR with Horiba OBS pitot tube exhaust mass flow sensor and gas sampler. Twenty nine hot start repeat journeys were conducted at different times of the day (morning and evening rush hours, lunch time, night) so that a range of traffic conditions were included and eight <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> <b>tests</b> for the same journeys were conducted and compared with the hot start results and shown to give significantly higher emissions. The vehicle was equipped with thermocouple, lambda sensor and GPS for travel parameter analysis. The GHG including CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O, nitrogen species in the exhaust gases including NO, NO 2, N 2 O, NH 3 and HCN and other emissions were analysed. The results were compared to the NEDC and WLTC. One of the suggestions from this work is that the proposal for the EU RDE test procedure do not include congested traffic driving and <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> which will compromise its expected purpose and effect. ...|$|R

Emissions species were measured at 0. 5 Hz. The tests were designed to enable <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> to occur into congested traffic, typical of the situation of people living alongside congested roads into a large city. The <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> was monitored through temperature measurements of the TWC front and rear face temperatures and lubricating oil temperatures. The emissions are presented {{to the end of}} the <b>cold</b> <b>start,</b> defined when the downstream TWC face temperature is hotter than the front face which occurred at ~ 350 - 400 oC. Journeys at various times of the day were conducted to investigate traffic flow impacts on the <b>cold</b> <b>start.</b> The <b>test</b> route had traffic and pedestrian crossing lights, several major road junctions and a busy shopping area. The time aligned vehicle moving parameters with pollutant emission data and fuel consumption enabled the micro-analysis of correlations between these parameters. The average <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> emissions, fuel consumption and temperature data are presented for the journeys into different levels of congestion (based on the mean speed of the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> journey). The mean complete journey speed during was shown to reasonably correlate the emissions, which increased as mean speed reduced. The <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> congested traffic portion was separately analysed to show the much higher emissions for equivalence mean speeds. Engine vehicle specific power (VSP) output was calculated and used together with the fuel flow to determine the instantaneous and average thermal efficiency. Three way catalysts (TWC) light off was approximately 200 seconds, much longer than for the NEDC test cycle.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{planning of}} electricity generation in a liberalised market using the Bloom and Gallant {{model can be}} posed as a quadratic programming (QP) problem with an exponential number of linear inequality constraints called load-matching constraints (LMCs) and several other linear non-LMCs.

The problem is then solved as a nite succession of QP problems with an increasing, though still limited, number of LMCs, which can be solved eciently using a direct method, as would be the case with a QP interior-point algorithm.

Engine <b>tests</b> were conducted at variable speed, ranging from 1000 rpm to 3000 rpm at constant 80 N m torque on a 4 -cylinder turbocharged indirect injection diesel engine. Engine performance parameters like brake specific fuel consumption, brake specific energy consumption, brake thermal efficiency and engine emissions like carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxide and smoke opacity were measured. Performance and exhaust emissions variation of the modified blends from the baseline fuel (jatropha biodiesel-diesel blend) were compared for the assessment of the improvement quantitatively. In-cylinder pressure diagram of all the test fuels were acquired and the heat release rate analysis was conducted at different operating conditions to explore the features of combustion mechanism and correlate them with the performance and emission characteristics to acquire better understanding of the scenario. However, in a nut-shell, the investigation reveals the potential of n-butanol and diethyl ether to be used as the additive of jatropha biodiesel-diesel blend in the context of combustion, performance and emission characteristics.

40|$|Computer-based {{multimedia}} {{learning environments}} {{support the idea}} that people learn better and more deeply when appropriate pictures (i. e., animations, video, static graphics) are added to text or narration. There are many adaptive learning systems that adapt learning materials to student properties, preferences, and activities. Adaptive learning environments mostly support only traditional concepts of learning. There is a need to design and develop an e-learning system that embodies principles of constructivist learning approach. The solution is in recommenders systems, which suggest items of interest to users based on their preferences (i. e. previous ratings). If there are no ratings for a certain user or item/object, there is a situation called a <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem, which leads to unreliable recommendations. Researchers mostly avoid tackling the absolute <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> in recommender systems. The topic of presented dissertation is designing a recommender system with a novel approach to avoid <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem. Approaches for solving the new user <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem can be divided into two main groups: the first group performs additional inquiries to gather more information about the users; and the second group uses dedicated algorithms for users in the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> state. The first group of approaches aims at performing additional inquiries about the user. According to this approach, we relate combinations of different learning styles (taking into account four different learning styles models) to preferred multimedia types. We explore a decision model aimed at proposing learning material of an appropriate multimedia type. The study includes 272 student participants. The resulting decision model shows that students prefer well-structured learning texts with colour discrimination, and that the hemispheric learning style model is the most important criterion in deciding student preferences for different multimedia learning materials. To provide a more accurate and reliable model for recommending different multimedia types more learning style models must be combined. Kolb’s classification and the VAK classification allow us to learn if students prefer {{an active role in the}} learning process, and what multimedia type they prefer. The results also shows that there is an obvious need to combine learning styles model in order to get a wider view of the student’s characteristics: an approach to problem solving problems, cognitive modes, way of thinking, and a dominant mode of perceiving information. On another hand, model recommends same multimedia material regardless of the learning topic. In the second part of our research, we have designed and developed a novel approach for alleviating the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem by imputing missing values into the input matrix, thereby improving recommendation performance. Our approach has three steps: 1) finding similar users to given user in <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> state; 2) selecting relevant attributes for the imputation process; 3) aggregate ratings to input matrix for a user in the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> state. We separate our approach for solving <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem into solving absolute <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem and solving partial <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem. According to the results of our experiments (solving absolute <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem), the results indicate that all our proposed methods improve recommending for non-negative matrix factorization with stochastic gradient descent (NG). For semi-non-negative matrix factorization with missing data (SN), combinations FR-ME (imputing attribute's mean value into the attributes that have the highest frequency of the most frequent values) and SD-MF (imputing attribute’s most frequent value into attributes that have the lowest standard deviation) improve recommendations for users in the absolute <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> state. For non-negative matrix factorization with alternating least squares (NS) and matrix factorization by data fusion (DF), none of variations of proposed parameters (methods) improves recommending in absolute <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> state. In the next stage of our research, we evaluated our approach for solving partial <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem. Statistical analysis of experimental evaluation of our approach on the artificial domain showed that each parameter significantly improved recommending of matrix factorization methods. The methods that yield improvements in recommendation accuracy compared with the raw matrix factorization are methods that consider 25...|$|R

40|$|Recommender {{system is}} a {{specific}} type of intelligent systems, which exploits historical user ratings on items and/or auxiliary information to make recommendations on items to the users. It plays a critical role {{in a wide range of}} online shopping, e-commercial services and social networking applications. Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most popular approaches used for recommender systems, but it suffers from complete <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> (CCS) problem where no rating record are available and incomplete <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> (ICS) problem where only a small number of rating records are available for some new items or users in the system. In this paper, we propose two recommendation models to solve the CCS and ICS problems for new items, which are based on a framework of tightly coupled CF approach and deep learning neural network. A specific deep neural network SADE is used to extract the content features of the items. The state of the art CF model, timeSVD++, which models and utilizes temporal dynamics of user preferences and item features, is modified to take the content features into prediction of ratings for <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> items. Extensive experiments on a large Netflix rating dataset of movies are performed, which show that our proposed recommendation models largely outperform the baseline models for rating prediction of <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> items. The two proposed recommendation models are also evaluated and compared on ICS items, and a flexible scheme of model retraining and switching is proposed to deal with the transition of items from <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> to non-cold start status. The experiment results on Netflix movie recommendation show the tight coupling of CF approach and deep learning neural network is feasible and very effective for <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> item recommendation. The design is general and can be applied to many other recommender systems for online shopping and social networking applications. The solution of <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> item problem can largely improve user experience and trust of recommender systems, and effectively promote <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> items...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{and rapid}} startup of proton {{exchange}} membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) at subfreezing temperatures (also called <b>cold</b> <b>start)</b> {{is of great}} importance for their commercialization in automotive and portable devices. In order to maintain good proton conductivity, the water content in the membrane must be kept at a certain level {{to ensure that the}} membrane remains fully hydrated. However, the water in the pores of the catalyst layer (CL), gas diffusion layer (GDL) and the membrane may freeze once the cell temperature decreases below the freezing point (Tf). Thus, methods which could enable the fuel cell startup without or with slight performance degradation at subfreezing temperature need to be studied. This paper presents an extensive review on <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> of PEMFCs, including the state and phase changes of water in PEMFCs, impacts of water freezing on PEMFCs, numerical and experimental studies on PEMFCs, and <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> strategies. The impacts on each component of the fuel cell are discussed in detail. Related numerical and experimental work is also discussed.
