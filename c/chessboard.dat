50|$|<b>Chessboards</b> arise {{frequently}} in computer vision {{theory and practice}} because their highly structured geometry is well-suited for algorithmic detection and processing. The appearance of <b>chessboards</b> in computer vision {{can be divided into}} two main areas: camera calibration and feature extraction. This article provides a unified discussion of the role that <b>chessboards</b> play in the canonical methods from these two areas, including references to the seminal literature, examples, and pointers to software implementations.|$|R

5|$|Chess is a two-player {{board game}} {{utilizing}} a <b>chessboard</b> and sixteen pieces of six types for each player. Each type of piece moves in a distinct way. The {{goal of the}} game is to checkmate (threaten with unescapable capture) the opponent's king. Games do not necessarily end with checkmate; players often resign if they believe they will lose. A game can also end in a draw in several ways.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to slides and pools, the park featured several other family attractions. In 2010 it added a beach family-fun area, a children's attraction featuring a giant <b>chessboard</b> with movable playing pieces such as knights, rooks and pawns. There {{was also a}} sand-beach area overlooking Geauga Lake. Little Tikes Town, a children's area with playhouses and toys, is located behind Thunder Falls.|$|E
5|$|The <b>chessboard</b> {{on the top}} of {{the cabinet}} was thin enough to allow for a {{magnetic}} linkage. Each piece in the chess set had a small, strong magnet attached to its base, and when they were placed on the board the pieces would attract a magnet attached to a string under their specific places on the board. This allowed the director inside the machine to see which pieces moved where on the chess board. The bottom of the <b>chessboard</b> had corresponding numbers, 1–64, allowing the director to see which places on the board were affected by a player's move. The internal magnets were positioned in a way that outside magnetic forces did not influence them, and Kempelen would often allow a large magnet to sit at the side of the board in an attempt to show that the machine was not influenced by magnetism.|$|E

Specifically, we characterize {{the dimensions of}} cylindrical <b>chessboards</b> that admit closed knight's tours realizing {{the identity of the}} fundamental group and those that admit closed tours realizing a generator of the fundamental group. We also produce analogous results for toroidal <b>chessboards.</b> Comment: 24 pages, 15 figure...|$|R
5|$|The size of {{the squares}} of the <b>chessboard</b> should be {{approximately}} 1.25 to 1.3 times {{the diameter of the}} base of the king, or 50 to 65mm. Squares of approximately 57mm (inches) normally are well-suited for pieces with the kings in the preferred size range. The darker squares are usually brown or green and the lighter squares are off-white or buff.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} factor in the evaluation of chess positions is the pawn structure (sometimes known as the pawn skeleton), or the configuration of pawns on the <b>chessboard.</b> Since pawns are the least mobile of the chess pieces, the pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position. Weaknesses in the pawn structure, such as isolated, doubled, or backward pawns and , once created, are often permanent. Care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset (for example, by the possibility of developing an attack).|$|E
5|$|Another {{part of the}} machine's {{exhibition}} was {{the completion of the}} knight's tour, a famed chess puzzle. The puzzle requires the player to move a knight around a <b>chessboard,</b> touching each square once along the way. While most experienced chess players of the time still struggled with the puzzle, the Turk was capable of completing the tour without any difficulty from any starting point via a pegboard used by the director with a mapping of the puzzle laid out.|$|E

5|$|John Gaughan, an American {{manufacturer}} of equipment for magicians based in Los Angeles, spent $120,000 building {{his own version}} of Kempelen's machine over a five-year period from 1984. The machine uses the original <b>chessboard,</b> which was stored separately from the original Turk and was not destroyed in the fire. The first public display of Gaughan's Turk was in November 1989 at a history of magic conference. The machine was presented much as Kempelen presented the original, except that the opponent was replaced by a computer running a chess program.|$|E

Using the chalice, he discovers {{an image of a}} church with a square tower. George returns to the Countess, and he discovers that the biblical references show a secret area inside a well containing a <b>chessboard</b> mural with a river running through it. Compiling their clues, George, Nicole and Andre decide that the Templars are going to Bannockburn, Scotland. George and Nicole board a train, but she and an old woman in their compartment soon go missing. He reaches the conductor's carriage, where the old woman, Khan in disguise, throws Flap out of the carriage. However, Khan is shot and killed by another man. George and Nicole reach the church {{in time to see the}} Grand Master of the Templars acquire a power from two huge Baphomet idols—the Sword of Baphomet, or the Broken Sword. After trying to tempt George to join their ranks, the Grand Master orders the couple to be killed, but they escape with the aid of explosives. The church explodes, killing Guido, the Templars and—presumably—the Grand Master. The game ends with George and Nico on their last date on the Eiffel Tower.|$|E
5|$|Carlsen's next tournament was the Grand Slam Masters Final on 9–15 October, {{which he}} had {{qualified}} for automatically by winning three of the previous year's four Grand Slam chess events (2009 Nanjing Pearl Spring, 2010 Corus, 2010 Bazna Kings). Along with Carlsen, the finals consisted of World Champion Anand and the highest two scorers from the preliminary stage held in Shanghai in September: Kramnik and Shirov. The average Elo of the participants {{at the time was}} 2789, making the Grand Slam Final the strongest chess tournament in history. In the first round, Carlsen lost with black to Kramnik; this was Carlsen's second consecutive loss to Kramnik, and placed his hold on the world No. 1 ranking in serious jeopardy. In his second round, Carlsen lost with the white pieces to Anand; this was his first loss as White since January 2010. Carlsen recovered somewhat {{in the latter part of}} the tournament, achieving a win over Shirov, and finishing with 2½/6. The tournament was won by Kramnik with 4/6. Carlsen finished this tournament with a rating of 2802, two points behind Anand at 2804 who temporarily ended Carlsen's reign at world No. 1. These setbacks called into question from some whether Carlsen's activities outside chess, such as modelling for G-Star Raw, were distracting him from performing well at the <b>chessboard.</b> Carlsen said he did not believe there was a direct connection.|$|E

25|$|Finding all {{solutions}} to the eight queens puzzle {{is a good example}} of a simple but nontrivial problem. For this reason, it is often used as an example problem for various programming techniques, including nontraditional approaches such as constraint programming, logic programming or genetic algorithms. Most often, it is used as an example of a problem that can be solved with a recursive algorithm, by phrasing the n queens problem inductively in terms of adding a single queen to any solution to the problem of placing n1 queens on an n-by-n <b>chessboard.</b> The induction bottoms out with the solution to the 'problem' of placing 0 queens on the <b>chessboard,</b> which is the empty <b>chessboard.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In this setting, camera {{calibration}} is {{the process}} of estimating the parameters of the [...] matrix [...] of the perspective model. Camera calibration is an important step in the computer vision pipeline because many subsequent algorithms require knowledge of camera parameters as input. <b>Chessboards</b> are often used during camera calibration because they are simple to construct, and their planar grid structure defines many natural interest points in an image. The following two methods are classic calibration techniques that often employ <b>chessboards.</b>|$|R

25|$|It is {{also known}} as <b>chessboard</b> {{distance}}, since in the game of chess the minimum number of moves needed by a king to go from one square on a <b>chessboard</b> to another equals the Chebyshev distance between the centers of the squares, if the squares have side length one, as represented in 2-D spatial coordinates with axes aligned to the edges of the board.
