40|$|The fishery for mobulid rays, {{also known}} as devil rays, has been practiced in the Bohol Sea {{for over a century}} yet very little is known about its history and characteristics. This study {{provides}} the first detailed description of the mobulid ray fishery in the Bohol Sea, Philippines. It describes the history and evolution of the fishery from the 19 th century to 2013. It characterizes the fishery based on the species targeted, gears used, the organization, catch distribution, processing, monetary value, and the market of its by-products. This paper also analyses the changes that occurred through time, the management of the fishery and the drivers of the fishery. A multi-disciplinary approach was employed by combining ethno-historical research methods and <b>catch</b> <b>landing</b> monitoring in four primary sites within the Bohol Sea. This fishery began as an artisanal fishery using sail and row boats equipped with harpoons and gaff hooks practiced in at least four coastal villages in Bohol, Camiguin and Limasawa. The fishing fleet has decreased {{since the beginning of the}} 20 th century however, with the motorization of the fishery and shift to the use of gillnets, the extent of the fishing grounds and market of the products have expanded. Four species of mobulid rays are caught in the Bohol Sea: Manta birostris, Mobula japanica, Mobula thurstoni and Mobula tarapacana. A fifth species, targeted by a fishing community off Dinagat as an off-shoot of the Bohol fishery is most likely the Manta alfredi. Currently, the fishery for mobulids is centered in Bohol Province where it has been practiced longest. The monetary value of mobulids in this region has increased and the dependence of fishing communities for their livelihood is significant. The unique characteristics of this fishery and the socio-cultural context within which it operates merits a thorough investigation in order to design the appropriate management strategy...|$|E
40|$|Lake Liambezi in the Zambezi Region of Namibia, {{formerly}} known as the Caprivi Region, is shallow (< 6 m deep) and characterised by cyclic episodes of filling and drying. When full the lake supports a highly productive fishery and when dry the lake is completely dry and used for agriculture and grazing. In 2000 the lake filled, and between May 2011 and April 2012 was surveyed using beach seine, experimental gillnets and <b>catch</b> <b>landing</b> surveys to obtain information for conservation and management recommendations for the fishery. Littoral fishes in Lake Liambezi and the Kavango floodplain were sampled using seine net and physicochemical properties were measured. Seine net surveys demonstrated that Lake Liambezi littoral zones were dominated by fishes of the family Alestidae (59. 7 %) while Cichlids constituted the most diverse family. Juvenile Tilapia rendalli and Oreochromis macrochir were among the five most important species in the littoral zone, indicating that these commercially important species use the littoral zone as a nursery ground. Since T. rendalli and O. macrochir are commercially important species, because of this, it is advised that seine nets should not be used. Catch efficiency between monofilament and multifilament gillnets in Lake Liambezi offshore waters were assessed. Catch efficiency experimental fishing trials showed that monofilament gillnets catch per unit effort (CPUE) was three times higher than that of multifilament gillnets for Oreochromis andersonii, O. macrochir, T. rendalli, Serranochromis macrocephalus and Clarias spp. Oreochromis andersonii comprised over 66 % of the overall CPUE for both net types combined indicating the importance of this species in the gillnet fishery on the lake. A fishery has been established on the lake with more than 300 canoes and 120 fishermen using monofilament and multifilament gillnets. CPUE was 15 kg/canoe/day and was significantly (P < 0. 05) associated with monthly temperature and moon phase parameters indicating that the fishery of Lake Liambezi may be altered by climate and environmental factors. Annual catch from Lake Liambezi was estimated at 3193 t with an estimated productivity of 106 kg/ha, suggesting that Lake Liambezi makes a significant contribution to the fish supply in the Zambezi Region. Recommendations were made to manage the Lake Liambezi fishery by imposing restrictions on effort (number of fishing boats), gear type, mesh sizes and access. Proper fisheries management and monitoring should incorporate climatic and environmental factors such as temperature and moon phase {{to meet the challenges of}} global climatic changes as well as other environmental issues...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Lack of reliable, {{high quality}} fishing {{activity}} data has undermined efforts to monitor marine fisheries efficiently. Further, {{there are many}} barriers to capturing this data including inefficient paper processes, lack of trust or incentives to encourage participation, few sources to verify data, and a landscape of information silos. One way to overcome these barriers is to improve fisheries data capture using technology. This project sought to better understand how small-scale dockside fisheries monitoring programs can transition from paper-based methods to digital data collection using a smartphone app. Market-testing of the app using surveys and interviews revealed that a typical NGO fisheries data collection program operates 7 field sites, is paper-based, collects data using dockside monitors, experiences an average time lag of 5 weeks from data recording to usability, and costs an average of $ 99, 000 annually. These NGOs prioritize ‘sustainable management of local resources’ as their most important organizational goal, rank ‘species type’ as the most valuable type of data collected, and rank ‘building local capacity’ as the most significant issue of concern related to fisheries data collection. Because the success of an electronic reporting program will hinge {{on the ability of}} these technology tools to provide clear and tangible benefits to fisheries, the app was then field-tested in a small-scale Indonesian tuna fishery as part of a pilot study. Specifically, I compared paper-based data collection methods to the app according to predetermined metrics of success (timeliness and availability; data collection cost) at 2 field sites. When using the app, data collectors tended to lose time at one site (34 % increase in time) and save time at the other (53 % decrease in time). This difference among sites was likely due to variations in patterns of <b>catch</b> <b>landing,</b> internet connectivity, and employee adoption rate. Total cost (including equipment and labor costs) was projected to increase by an average of 20 % per field sampling site when using the app. Time and cost metric data were then used to generate a cost-benefit analysis, which revealed that implementing this app at all field sites would result in a 12 % increase in total cost during the first year, followed by a 13 % cost decrease in subsequent years. Over a 5 -year horizon, using the app at all field sites was projected to decrease overall cost of data collection by 8 %. Specifically, high initial equipment costs would be balanced by a decrease in labor cost in the medium to long term. Ultimately, the incentive to transition to electronic monitoring in a particular fishery is highly dependent on the data needs of that fishery and the management goals of the organization as well as the strength of time preference (i. e. willingness to wait for future returns), and I hope lessons learned from this case study will provide other organizations with valuable insight as they contemplate similar transitions...|$|E
40|$|What is {{the focus}} of {{attention}} in the post-harvest fishing industry? Like other branches of the food sector, the post-harvest fishing industry depends on providing products that are both safe and which meet consumers´ increasing demands for quality. As fish exporters, we have a particularly difficult job because fish are extremely susceptible to contamination. They are exposed to everything from pathogens and allergens to heavy metals, parasites and toxins, so the potential health hazards for fish consumers are legion. What´s more, fish are highly perishable. Especially in hot climates, significant quality losses can occur very soon after the fish are caught. What is needed, then, is a control mechanism that takes in both these factors right through the entire fish processing supply chain, from the moment a fish is caught to the dispatch of the final product. Our fish processing plant in Uganda {{is one of the first}} in East Africa to implement such a comprehensive control mechanism. It has put into place a system of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) which is based on standard operating procedures and good manufacturing practices. HACCP dates back to the 1960 s, when NASA needed a foolproof method to prevent potentially catastrophic disease-producing bacteria and toxins in food consumed on space missions. From the 1990 s onwards, the food industry has adopted this method to comply with international food safety and hygiene regulations, chief among them European Council directives 91 / 493 /EEC and 98 / 83 /EEC, which lay down the requirements for handling and marketing fish products destined for the EU. HACCP is, essentially, a management tool that establishes control over the entire food preparation process. It aims to prevent food safety problems rather than identifying them after they have already occurred. Under this system, food inspections take place at every level of the fish supply chain - at the <b>catch,</b> <b>landing,</b> processing and marketing stages - and involve all main industry stakeholders, from small fishermen and processing plant workers to traders and regulatory authorities. When, for example, a parasite is found in a catch at the landing stage, it is stopped in its tracks and will never reach the processing plant, thus preventing mounting costs and the further spread of the organism. HACCP also imposes strict standards regarding the construction of buildings and equipment intended for holding fish prior to export. On-site laboratories, strict record keeping, and accurate traceability procedures are other requirements. Can you describe the fish processing phases and how ICTs are integrated? The chain starts with the local fishers, who are increasingly using ICTs in their daily activities. Mobile phones, for example, now allow fishing crews to communicate with staff on shore, to notify them of any preparations that need to be made or to alert them to any difficulties. Many larger fishing vessels are equipped with computers and software that allow their crews to weigh their catch immediately and store it at the right temperature. Also, in the near future, sophisticated GPS and sonar devices will provide an affordable means of accurately tracking and determining the size of fish stocks (see elsewhere in this issue). Once ashore, the fish are subjected to quality control inspections with the help of software that measures the catch against predefined standards, assessing everything from the freshness and shelf-life of the fish, to their texture and post-mortem skin colour. The results are entered into a database. Fish that pass the test are transported to the processing plant, where they are weighed by electronic scales and graded with the help of another software package. The next step involves plant workers filleting or descaling the fish, while computer programs calculate the speed at which this is carried out and continually regulate work environment temperatures. When the fish have been deskinned and trimmed, they are graded once more as workers input their new weight and quality parameters into a database. They are then quickly moved to a chilling/freezing area, where a computer monitors the temperature and total amount of time the fish are required to stay inside. The fish are subsequently packed in boxes or cartons and moved to a separate cold storage area, which is also computer-controlled, before being dispatched to the airport or port. Marine Products Ltd is currently working to perfect this HACCP-based and ICT-supported quality control system. HACCP not only allows us to comply with EU regulations, it also produces an efficient work environment that our employees find stimulating. Above all, the system - which is in place in several other Ugandan fish processing plants - has made it possible for us to stay competitive in the international export market and to secure the future of our national fisheries. Venu Pidachy is a quality assurance manager at Uganda Marine Products, Kampala. How are ICTs being used to support post-harvest fishing activities?
