50|$|In Summer 2009 South West Trains {{announced}} plans to replace the heritage EMUs with more modern units; Class 158 Sprinters on weekdays and Class 450 on weekends (the latter were also used on occasion when the 3Cigs were unavailable, with the 4th <b>carriage</b> <b>locked</b> out of use to overcome the platform height issue at Lymington Town). This change took place on 23 May 2010, with the final 3Cig service departing from Lymington Pier on 22 May 2010 at 22:14 and arriving at Brockenhurst at 22:24.|$|R
2500|$|In 1997 {{the fleet}} was {{augmented}} {{with the addition}} of eight 4Big units from Connex South Central. These operated with the counter in the buffet <b>carriages</b> <b>locked</b> out of use. By 1999 these units had been stored, but then eight additional [...] "Greyhound" [...] units were converted from the redundant 4Bigs. The units were reclassified as Class 421/8, and renumbered in the range 1392–1399. The modifications included the removal of the buffet carriages, which were replaced by spare intermediate trailers from mechanically similar 4Cep units. Most of these trailers came from 4Cep units to make 3Cep units, but a few came from withdrawn units. These trailers were immediately recognisable since although they had the same body profile {{as the rest of the}} unit the windows were different and they had InterCity70 seating. The buffet carriages were withdrawn, although many were saved for preservation.|$|R
2500|$|The {{ride through}} the dreary tunnel with the dark waters of the canal beneath us, and an {{insecure}} chalk roof above our heads, enlivened as it is by occasional shrieks from the engine's vaporous lungs, and the unceasing rattle of the train, is apt to make one feel somewhat nervous; and the first glimpse of bright daylight that breaks upon us, relieves us from a natural anxiety as to the chances we run of being crushed {{by the fall of}} some twenty tons of chalk from above, or being precipitated into twenty feet of water beneath, with the doors of the <b>carriages</b> <b>locked</b> and no [...] "Nautilus belt" [...] around our waists and not even a child's caul in our pocket. This relief is however temporary, for the light only breaks in through a gap in the tunnel, and some more experienced traveller informs us we are only half out of it. However, our journey is brought to a close without any accident: and we embark on the steamer that is to deposit us at Chatham.|$|R

5000|$|The initial {{shock of}} firing was absorbed by a hydro-spring mechanism, {{allowing}} 34 inches of recoil within the gun mounting. The remaining recoil energy was absorbed {{by allowing the}} entire railway wagon to roll backwards 40 feet (Vickers carriage) or 3-4 yards (Armstrong <b>carriage)</b> against <b>locked</b> brakes. This [...] "rolling recoil" [...] system allowed the gun to be operated without the need to construct a pit with a strong static platform below the gun for it to recoil into and to allow transmission of all the recoil force directly {{to the ground as}} was typical of many large US and French railway guns.|$|R

Then a man made Suneo faint while he was {{laughing}} evil, but he couldn't save Nobita and the others inside which the door is lock.|$|R
50|$|Dovetail slides, or {{dovetail}} way slides {{are typically}} constructed from cast iron, {{but can also}} be constructed from hard-coat aluminum, acetal or stainless steel. Like any bearing, a dovetail slide is composed of a stationary linear base and a moving carriage. a Dovetail carriage has a v-shaped, or dovetail-shaped protruding channel which locks into the linear base's correspondingly shaped groove. Once the dovetail carriage is fitted into its base's channel, the <b>carriage</b> is <b>locked</b> into the channel's linear axis and allows free linear movement. When a platform {{is attached to the}} carriage of a dovetail slide, a dovetail table is created, offering extended load carrying capabilities.|$|R
5000|$|Today was Sykes' first {{break into}} {{national}} media. He {{was hired by}} the programme soon after covering the 1978 sleeper-train fire in Taunton, Somerset, in which 12 people died. Sykes had interviewed a seriously burned survivor, who revealed from his hospital bed that many passengers had been unable to escape the flames and smoke because the <b>carriage</b> doors were <b>locked</b> and there was nothing available with which to break the sealed double-glazed windows. On Today, Sykes worked as a reporter and occasionally presenter along with Brian Redhead and John Timpson.|$|R

Their coachman, who knew he was to blame for this mishap, felt the {{advantage}} of taking time by the forelock in a case of accusation, and began swearing at his victim {{as if he were the}} sinner. Sol jumped out, and looking up at the occupants of the other conveyance, saw against the sky the back elevation of his father and Christopher Julian, sitting upon a little seat which they overhung, like two big puddings upon a small dish.|$|R
50|$|The Stepmother teaches {{her sons}} a new dance in {{preparation}} for the ball. The Baker arrives as a General Invitation Deliverer and gives CinderElmo an invitation to the ball, but the Stepmother won't permit him. When the horse and <b>carriage</b> arrive, she <b>locks</b> CinderElmo and his friends up in the house. When CinderElmo wishes upon a falling star, his Fairy Godperson comes and encourages CinderElmo {{to come up with some}} plan to make his dreams come true. After CinderElmo has a wash, Fairy Godperson provides him and Zoe with smart clothes, turns the dog into a handsome prince, turns the dog bowl into a carriage and the mice into horses. CinderElmo has limited time till midnight to make the best of what Fairy Godperson granted him.|$|R
50|$|In {{the last}} 50 {{years after the}} Indian {{independence}} and partition, many Hindu Right wing groups believe that the Muslims in India have preferential treatment with their own Muslim Personal Law. Communal tensions between the Hindus and the Muslims have erupted many a times during this period. Notable incidents of this phenomenon include the demolition of the Babri Masjid (believed to have been built on the sacred site of a demolished temple marking the birthplace of Lord Rāma) and the Gujarat riots of 2002. The Gujarat violence of 2002 is significant for recording the highest annual death toll in any event of Hindu-Muslim violence in a single state {{in the history of}} independent India: 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed following the murder of 59 innocent Hindu passengers mostly women and children allegedly by Muslim youths on a train near Godhra on 27 February. The incident that spurred the violence was when the Sabarmati Express train was attacked at Godhra allegedly by a Muslim mob and the coach carrying Hindu pilgrims, returning from Kar Seva {{at the site of the}} Babri Mosque, conflicting state enquiries established that the <b>carriage</b> was <b>locked</b> from outside and set on fire as per a preplanned conspiracy. 58 Hindu pilgrims, including 25 women and 15 children, returning from Ayodhya, were killed in the attack. This incident is not an isolated incident in the Gujarat state, in other states in India, especially in rural area violence between Muslims and Hindus is a common occurrence, that can result in fatalities.|$|R
6000|$|The tocsin is pealing its loudest, {{the clocks}} inaudibly {{striking}} Three, when poor Abbe Sicard, with some thirty other Nonjurant Priests, in six carriages, fare along the streets, from their preliminary House of Detention at the Townhall, westward towards the Prison of the Abbaye. Carriages enough stand deserted on the streets; these six move on,--through angry multitudes, cursing as they move. Accursed Aristocrat Tartuffes, {{this is the}} pass ye have brought us to! And now ye will break the Prisons, and set Capet Veto on horseback to ride over us? Out upon you, Priests of Beelzebub and Moloch; of Tartuffery, Mammon, and the Prussian Gallows,--which ye name Mother-Church and God! Such reproaches have the poor Nonjurants to endure, and worse; spoken in on them by frantic Patriots, who mount even on the carriage-steps; the very Guards hardly refraining. Pull up your carriage-blinds!--No! answers Patriotism, clapping its horny paw on the carriage blind, and crushing it down again. Patience in oppression has limits: we are close on the Abbaye, it has lasted long: a poor Nonjurant, of quicker temper, smites the horny paw with his cane; nay, finding solacement in it, smites the unkempt head, sharply and again more sharply, twice over,--seen clearly of us and of the world. It is the last that we see clearly. Alas, next moment, the <b>carriages</b> are <b>locked</b> and blocked in endless raging tumults; in yells deaf to the cry for mercy, which answer the cry for mercy with sabre-thrusts through the heart. (Felemhesi (anagram for Mehee Fils), La Verite tout entiere, sur les vrais auteurs de la journee du 2 Septembre 1792 (reprinted in Hist. Parl. xviii. 156-181), p. 167.) The thirty Priests are torn out, are massacred about the Prison-Gate, one after one,--only the poor Abbe Sicard, whom one Moton a watchmaker, knowing him, heroically tried to save, and secrete in the Prison, escapes to tell;--and it is Night and Orcus, and Murder's snaky-sparkling head has risen in the murk!-- ...|$|R
40|$|The Turning Oars {{collection}} {{features a}} series of photographs depicting {{the process of creating}} oars for Cape Kiwanda Wood Products of Pacific City by partners Paul Hanneman and Terry Learned. To look at the process chronologically, view the images in numerical order (Turning Oars 001 — Turning Oars 072). Terry Learned provided the description for this image. This photo features the cutter head or the “business end” of the machine used to shape the paddle end of the oar. A motor sits on the center left side. It has three blades in it and operates the cutter head. It is a 3 / 4 -horse motor that requires 220 electrical power. It has a big flat end on it and weighs about 100 pounds. The headstock is visible {{in the center of the}} photo. It holds the blade end of the oar blank. The headstock is made from a piece of ship channel with a pin in the middle that helps secure the blank in place. Overhead, belts can be seen. A leather belt runs up around a wood pulley. That wood pulley on a shaft has four other wood pulleys, each of which runs a belt down to four opposite sides of wood pulleys at the bottom. This four-speed system runs the headstock. It also runs a spine shaft underneath the bed that will drive the carriage once the <b>carriage</b> is <b>locked</b> to the shaft. A gearbox right behind the head contains eleven pairs of Model T Ford gears. Basically, there are forty-four speeds on the machine. By flipping a lever, the machine can run forward or in reverse. A wheel is also visible. This is the counterweight with a cable on it that runs to a pulley, then goes up to the carriage that holds it out. The patterns fit down the middle of the bed. The pattern indicates the shape and dictates where the oar machine is going to run. Learned explains, “You can make handles with it and everything else. ”[URL]...|$|R
6000|$|The same {{prospect}} of misery {{hung over the}} head of another tenant of this hardhearted lord of the soil. This was a tough true-blue Presbyterian, called Deans, who, though most obnoxious to the Laird on account of principles in church and state, contrived to maintain his ground upon the estate by regular payment of mail-duties, kain, arriage, <b>carriage,</b> dry multure, <b>lock,</b> gowpen, and knaveship, and all the various exactions now commuted for money, and summed up in the emphatic word rent. But the years 1700 and 1701, long remembered in Scotland for dearth and general distress, subdued the stout heart of the agricultural whig. Citations by the ground-officer, decreets of the Baron Court, sequestrations, poindings of outside and inside plenishing, flew about his ears as fast as the tory bullets whistled around those of the Covenanters at Pentland, Bothwell Brigg, or Airsmoss. Struggle as he might, and he struggled gallantly, [...] "Douce David Deans" [...] was routed horse and foot, and lay at the mercy of his grasping landlord just at the time that Benjamin Butler died. The fate of each family was anticipated; but they who prophesied their expulsion to beggary and ruin were disappointed by an accidental circumstance.|$|R
6000|$|Wilton {{came into}} my room {{about half an hour}} before dinner, and though his face was masked with a drop-curtain of highly {{embroidered}} indifference, I {{could see that he was}} not at ease. In time, for he was then almost as difficult to move as one of my own countrymen, I extracted the tale--simple in its extravagance, extravagant in its simplicity. It seemed that Hackman of the British Museum had been staying with him about ten days before, boasting of scarabs. Hackman has a way of carrying really priceless antiquities on his tie-ring and in his trouser pockets. Apparently, he had intercepted something on its way to the Boulak Museum which, he said, was [...] "a genuine Amen-Hotepa queen's scarab of the Fourth Dynasty." [...] Now Wilton had bought from Cassavetti, whose reputation is not above suspicion, a scarab of much the same scarabeousness, and had left it in his London chambers. Hackman at a venture, but knowing Cassavetti, pronounced it an imposition. There was long discussion--savant versus millionaire, one saying: [...] "ut I know it cannot be"; and the other: [...] "But I can and will prove it." [...] Wilton found it necessary for his soul's satisfaction to go up to town, then and there,--a forty-mile run,--and bring back the scarab before dinner. It was at this point that he began to cut corners with disastrous results. Amberley Royal station being five miles away, and putting in of horses a matter of time, Wilton had told Howard, the immaculate butler, to signal the next train to stop; and Howard, who was more of a man of resource than his master gave him credit for, had, with the red flag of the ninth hole of the links which crossed the bottom of the lawn, signalled vehemently to the first down-train; and it had stopped. Here Wilton's account became confused. He attempted, it seems, to get into that highly indignant express, but a guard restrained him with more or less force--hauled him, in fact, backyards from the window of a <b>locked</b> <b>carriage.</b> Wilton must have struck the gravel with some vehemence, for the consequences, he admitted, were a free fight on the line in which he lost his hat, and was at last dragged into the guard's van and set down breathless.|$|R
