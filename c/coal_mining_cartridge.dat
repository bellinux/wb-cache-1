30|$|Many {{scholars}} at {{home and}} abroad studied the current problems of China’s <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> supervision system from different aspects to explain the high occurrence of <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> accidents.

A number of studies have quantitatively analyzed the effectiveness of <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> safety supervisions (Viscusi 1979, 1986; Lewis-Back and Alford 1980; Gray and Jones 1991), and the results showed that there exist significant correlation between <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> accidents rate and the intensity of government supervision. Chinese scholar Xiao (2009, 2010) have empirically studied the effectiveness of China’s <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> safety regulation based on VAR model, and he drew the conclusion that China’s <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> safety regulation was effective in the long run. However, there is less research on quantitative study of China’s <b>coal</b> <b>mine</b> safety supervision, especially on quantitative study of the three types of collieries, and most research to date has focused on qualitative analysis.
