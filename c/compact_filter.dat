40|$|This paper proposes an {{efficient}} parallel computing approach {{based on a}} high-order accurate compact finite difference scheme {{in conjunction with a}} conventional domain decomposition method and MPI libraries. The proposed parallel computing approach consists of two major features: (a) a newly developed compact finite difference scheme with extended stencils containing halo points around subdomain boundaries, and (b) a predictor–corrector type implementation of a <b>compact</b> <b>filter</b> that effectively suppresses spurious errors from the subdomain boundaries. The current work employs three halo cells for the inter-node communication, based on which the coefficients of the new compact scheme at the subdomain boundaries are optimized to achieve as high level of resolution and accuracy as the interior compact scheme provides. Also, an optimal set of cut-off wavenumbers of the <b>compact</b> <b>filter</b> that minimizes spurious errors is suggested. It is shown that the level of errors from the proposed parallel calculations lies within the same order of magnitude of that from the single-domain serial calculations.

40|$|We {{describe}} a new photonic-crystal structure {{with a complete}} three-dimensional photonic band gap (PBG) and its potential application to integrated optics. The structure not only has a large band gap and is amenable to layer-by-layer litho-fabrication, but also introduces the feature of high-symmetry planar layers resembling two-dimensional photonic crystals. This feature enables integrated optical devices to be constructed by modification of only a single layer, and supports waveguide and resonant-cavity modes that strongly resemble the corresponding modes in the simpler and well-understood 2 d systems.
