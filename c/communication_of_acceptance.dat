2500|$|Once {{an offer}} is made, {{the general rule}} is the offeree must {{communicate}} her acceptance {{in order to have}} a binding agreement. Notification of acceptance must actually reach a point where the offeror could reasonably be expected to know, although if the recipient is at fault, for instance, by not putting enough ink in their fax machine for a message arriving in office hours to be printed, the recipient will still be bound. This goes for all methods of communication, whether oral, by phone, through telex, fax or email, except for the post. Acceptance by letter takes place when the letter is put in the postbox. The postal exception is a product of history, and does not exist in most countries. It only exists in English law so long as it is reasonable to use the post for a reply (e.g. not in response to an email), and its operation would not create manifest inconvenience and absurdity (e.g. the letter goes missing). In all cases it is possible for the negotiating parties to stipulate a prescribed mode of acceptance. It is not possible for an offeror to impose an obligation on the offeree to reject the offer without her consent. However, it is clear that people can accept through silence, firstly, by demonstrating through their conduct that they accept. In Brogden v Metropolitan Railway Company, although the Metropolitan Railway Company had never returned a letter from Mr Brogden formalising a long term supply arrangement for Mr Brogden's coal, they had conducted themselves for two years as if it were in effect, and Mr Brogden was bound. Secondly, the offeror may waive the need for <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance,</b> either expressly, or implicitly, as in Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company. Here a quack medicine company advertised its [...] "smoke ball", stating that if a customer found it did not cure them of the flu after using it thrice daily for two weeks, they would get £100. After noting the advertisement was serious enough to be an offer, not mere puff or an invitation to treat, the Court of Appeal held the accepting party only needed to use the smokeball as prescribed to get the £100. Although the general rule was to require <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance,</b> the advertisement had tacitly waived the need for Mrs Carlill, or anyone else, to report her acceptance first. In other cases, such as where a reward is advertised for information, the only requirement of the English courts appears to be knowledge of the offer. Where someone makes such a unilateral offer, they fall under a duty to not revoke it once someone has begun to act on the offer. Otherwise an offer may always be revoked before it is accepted. The general rule is that revocation must be communicated, even if by post, although if the offerree hears about the withdrawal from a third party, this is as good as a withdrawal from the offeror himself. Finally, an offer can be [...] "killed off" [...] if, rather than a mere inquiry for information, someone makes a counter offer. So in Hyde v Wrench, when Wrench offered to sell his farm for £1000, and Hyde replied that he would buy it for £950 and Wrench refused, Hyde could not then change his mind and accept the original £1000 offer.|$|E

40|$|Seventy-four {{parents of}} {{children}} with cancer were asked to characterize the behavior of medical staff members with whom they interacted. Seven empirically distinct dimensions of staff behavior relevant to their relationships with parents were identified, including information transmission, clarity and honesty <b>of</b> <b>communication,</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> parental efficacy, resolution of conflicts, personal contact with parents, empathy with the child, and staff competence. With respect to their experiences with the treatment of their child, parents also were asked to indicate their satisfaction with the medical staff in terms of changes in their respect and/or anger for the medical staff, changes in feelings about doctors, support received from doctors and nurses, and stress resulting from tense relations with the staff. The seven dimensions of parent-staff relationships were used as predictors in a series of multiple regressions employing these satisfaction measures as criteria. The overall quality of the parent-staff relationship was best predicted by positive personal contact. The strongest predictor of whether or not parents felt increased anger was staff empathy with child. Increased respect for the medical staff was predicted by a combination of information transmission and perception of staff competence.

Filial therapy is an intervention that focuses on strengthening and enhancing adult-child relationships. The fifth grade students were trained to be a therapeutic change agent for kindergarten children identified as having adjustment difficulties, by utilizing basic child-centered play therapy skills in weekly play sessions with the kindergarten children. Specifically, this research determined the effectiveness of filial therapy in increasing the fifth grade students': 1) empathic responses with kindergarten children; 2) <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> with kindergarten children; 3) allowance of self-direction with kindergarten children, and 4) involvement in play activities of kindergarten children. The experimental group of fifth grade students (N= 12) received thirty-five minutes of training twice a week for 5 weeks and then once a week {{for the duration of the}} 10 weeks of play sessions. The control group (N= 11) received no training during the 15 weeks of the project. Fifth grade student participants were videotaped playing with a kindergarten child identified as having adjustment difficulties in 20 -minute play sessions before and after the training to measure empathic behavior in adult-child interactions. Analysis of Covariance on adjusted post test means revealed that fifth grade children in the experimental group demonstrated statistically significant increases in empathic responses, acceptance, and behavioral willingness to follow the kindergarten children's lead, and involvement. A measure of <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> of kindergarten children's feelings and behaviors although not statistically significant indicated a positive trend. This study supports the use of filial therapy as an effective training model for increasing fifth grade students' empathic behavior with kindergarten children experiencing adjustment difficulties. Filial therapy offers significant possibilities for training fifth grade students in a developmentally appropriate model for working with kindergarten children, in order to prevent future problems. The observed power of the therapeutic relationship between the fifth grade students in the experimental group and the kindergarten children suggest the continued implementation of this innovative project...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the effectiveness of a filial/play therapy training model with high school juniors and seniors enrolled in a Peer Assistance and Leadership program (PALs). Filial/play therapy is an intervention that focuses on strengthening and enhancing adult-child relationships. The high students are trained to be a therapeutic change agent for primary school children identified as having adjustment difficulties by utilizing basic child-centered play therapy skills in weekly play sessions with young children. Specifically, this study is designed to determine the effectiveness of filial therapy in increasing: 1) the high school students' observed empathic behavior with young children, 2) the high school students' observed attitude of acceptance toward young children, 3) the high school students' observed ability to allow self-direction in young children, and 4) the high school students' observed level of involvement with young children. The experimental group, consisting of 16 volunteer high school students enrolled in a PALs class for high school credit, received a total of 24 weeks of filial/play therapy didactic training, application, and supervision for the playtimes they conducted with pre-kindergarten/kindergarten students identified with adjustment difficulties. The comparison group consisted of 15 volunteer high school students enrolled in a PALs class for high school credit. The comparison group received the standard PALs class curriculum. All students were videotaped playing with a young child 4 to 6 years of age before and after the training as a means of measuring empathic behavior with young children. An Analysis of Covariance revealed statistically significant findings in all four hypotheses. Specifically, the experimental group of high school students exhibited statistically significant increases in empathic interactions with young children when compared to the comparison group. The experimental group also exhibited statistically significant increases in <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> of young children's feelings and behaviors, acceptance and behavioral willingness to follow young children's lead rather than attempt to control their behavior, and attention to and participation in young children's play. This study supports the use of filial/play therapy as an effective training model for increasing high school students' empathic behavior with young children. Filial/play therapy offers significant possibilities for training high school students in a developmentally appropriate model for working with young children identified with school adjustment difficulties, in order to prevent future problems...|$|E

A second purpose was to determine the effectiveness of Filial Therapy training in reducing experimental group students': 1) overall behavior problems; 2) internalizing behaviors; and 3) externalizing behavior problems. Filial Therapy is a didactic/dynamic modality used by play therapists to train parents and teachers to be therapeutic agents with their children and students. Teachers are taught primary child-centered play therapy skills for use with their own students in weekly play sessions with their students. Teachers learn to create a special environment that enhances and strengthens the teacher-student emotional bond by means of which both teacher and child are assisted in personal growth and change. The experimental group (N= 24) consisted of 12 teachers, who participated in 11 weekly Filial Therapy training sessions (22 total instructional hours) during the fall semester at the preschool of a center for communications disorders, and 12 students chosen by the teachers as their student of focus. Teachers and students met once a week during the training for 30 minute teacher student play sessions in a room specified for this purpose. The non-treatment comparison group received no training during the 11 weeks. Teacher participants completed two written instruments: the Child Behavior Checklist/Caregiver-Teacher Report Form and the Meadow-Kendall Social-Emotional Assessment Inventory for Deaf and Hearing Impaired Students. Teachers who received Filial Therapy training were videotaped during student teacher play sessions. The videotaped sessions were used for pretest and posttest evaluation for the Measurement of Empathy in Adult-Child Interaction. Analysis of covariance revealed the children in the experimental group significantly decreased overall behavior problems. Teachers in the experimental group increased communication of empathy with their students of focus, significantly increased their attitude of acceptance with their students, and significantly increased in their ability to allow the students appropriate self-direction.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if parents trained in the Landreth Filial Therapy Model could demonstrate child-centered play therapy skills as effectively as graduate play therapy students who completed an Introduction to Play Therapy course. The participants in both the parent group and the graduate student group were videotaped in play sessions with children pre- and post-training in order to measure change in adult empathic behavior as defined on the Measurement of Empathy in Adult-Child Interaction (MEACI). The specific skills measured in this study were (a) communicating acceptance to the child, (b) allowing the child to direct his or her own play during the play sessions, (c) demonstrating appropriate levels of involvement in the child's play, and (d) demonstrating empathic behavior toward the child. The Landreth Filial Therapy Model is a training system that utilizes both didactic and dynamic means to train parents and other paraprofessionals to be therapeutic agents of change with children. Parents are taught child-centered play therapy skills to use in weekly home play sessions with their children in order to strengthen the emotional bond between parent and child. The Introduction to Play Therapy course is a graduate-level counseling course at the University of North Texas taught by Dr. Garry Landreth. The course focuses on the philosophy, theory, and skills of child-centered play therapy. Students enrolled in this course typically plan to use play therapy in professional settings. The filial-trained parent group (n = 21) consisted of the experimental group of single parents from Bratton and Landreth's (1995) study, Filial Therapy with Single Parents, Effects of Parental Acceptance, Empathy and Stress. The parents met for weekly 2 -hour filial therapy sessions over the course of 10 weeks and conducted six or seven 30 -minute play sessions at home with their child-of-focus. The graduate student group (n = 13) was enrolled in Dr. Landreth's Introduction to Play Therapy course during fall 2000. The class met over a course of a 15 -week semester for three hours per week. During the course of the semester, the students completed two play therapy sessions outside of class and two supervised play therapy sessions during class time. Analysis of covariance revealed that the play therapy-trained graduate students preformed at a statistically significant higher skill level than the filial-trained parents on Total Empathy scores and the Involvement subscale, but that there was no statistically significant difference between the groups' skill level on <b>Communication</b> <b>of</b> <b>Acceptance</b> to the child and Allowing the Child Self-Direction. Although the graduate students' mean post-training scores revealed a higher attainment of skill level, the parents made greater mean change of score on all measures except Involvement.

40|$|The {{eventual}} {{success of}} the product is valued based on the degree <b>of</b> its <b>acceptance</b> by the consumer market. In this paper, due to the frequent and rapid placement of new/modified products within {{a variety of industries}} and markets, the theory of "diffusion of innovation" is analyzed in detail. According to this theory, the process <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> and adoption <b>of</b> the product on the market known as diffusion is actually a process <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> the innovation through certain channels (mass media and interpersonal channels), over time, between members of a particular social system. For enterprises, in regards to the placement of new products on the market, is important {{to be aware of the}} basic factors that condition the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> innovation and accelerate the rate of adoption. The process of diffusion implies understanding and predicting consumer behavior. In this regard, it is critical to analyze the behavior of different types of consumers in the process <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> new products. Key words: new products, consumers, diffusion of innovation...|$|R
40|$|In an ever {{evolving}} technology dominated world, {{consumers and}} companies change their communication needs and wants. With a marketing-oriented {{new generation of}} customers, marketers must adopt new forms of efficient and targeted delivery of their message. Mobile marketing promises a direct one-to-one approach and a targeted commercial message, but, to be really appreciated by the customers, it needs their permission for a direct <b>communication.</b> The <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> customers depends on their level of trust in the company, {{due to the fact}} that mobile phones are one of the most personal devices and mobile marketing is using them as their communication channel. The purpose of this article is to synthesize the criteria for permission-based communication between companies and consumers. By establishing a constant bilateral communication flow with its customers, a company can leverage the interaction with its clients to new levels of trust and engagement...|$|R

Some suggest that flaws occur with random frequency; others claim that deficiencies are too diverse to measure. Methods. In 1995, an eight-page question-naire that contained 83 questions was mailed to {{a random sample of}} 50 peer reviewers for the Journal of the American Medical Association, 67 editors-in-chief of a sample of prominent medical journals, and 25 Nobel laureates in physiology or medicine of the preceding decade. Results. The overall response rate was 22 % (29 of 130); 12 undeliverable ques-tionnaires were excluded. Respondents reported that study-design problems were {{the most common cause of}} rejection (71 %). The survey results showed that the methods section contained the most flaws, was most often responsible for rejection, and was often too brief. Other common deficiencies were “conclusions unsup-ported by data ” and “results unoriginal, predictable, or trivial”. The most common writing problem was “wordiness”. Conclusions. Peer reviewers and editors reported that the manuscript deficiencies that most frequently led to rejection were related to study design and to the methods section. Scientific <b>communication</b> and likelihood <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> could be improved by more careful planning of study design and by including more reproducible detail in methods sections...|$|R
30|$|Combining these {{humanitarian}} technologies {{with the}} security triangle <b>of</b> <b>acceptance,</b> protection, and deterrence, organizations can broadcast and promote their programs and projects online via various fora to expand people’s understanding of their activities and build goodwill. Aid agencies can also employ basic communication technologies to crowdsource security information from the field to enhance their overview of volatile areas and to protect staff by pulling them back when a situation deteriorates (see Van der Windt and Humphreys 2016). Deterrence, additionally, can be modernized by the online <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> threats of withdrawal if aid workers are threatened or hurt.|$|R
50|$|An <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> {{the offer}} {{resulting}} in a binding contract must take place {{with knowledge of the}} offer and an intention to accept the offer. Although acceptance need not be express and may be implied from conduct, it must correspond with the offer; be unequivocal; and in general, be communicated to the offeror. Silence cannot be requested by the offeror to be, or used by the offeree as a method <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> for <b>acceptance.</b> Rather, if after a reasonable period has lapsed, silence will be seen as a rejection to the offer, unless the offeree's actions objectively show otherwise. Where a purported acceptance proposes one or more additional or different terms it is ineffective as an acceptance, unless the variation is solely in favour of the offeror. A purported acceptance will also be ineffective if made {{at a time when the}} offer has lapsed by virtue of time; if it is made subject to a contingency and that contingency ceases to exist; if the offeror dies and the offeree has notice of this fact; by the revocation of the offeror or the rejection by the offeree.|$|R
50|$|As {{a rule of}} convenience, if {{the offer}} is {{accepted}} by post, the contract comes into existence {{at the moment that}} the acceptance was posted. This rule only applies when, impliedly or explicitly, the parties have post in contemplation as a means <b>of</b> <b>acceptance.</b> It excludes contracts involving land, letters incorrectly addressed and instantaneous modes <b>of</b> <b>communication.</b> The relevance <b>of</b> this early 19th century rule to modern conditions, when many quicker means <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> are available has been questioned, but the rule remains good law for the time being.|$|R
40|$|Personal robots {{can help}} people live safer, more {{efficient}} and comfortable lives. However, such benefits cannot be achieved if people do not use, or accept, personal robots. The use of a technology is predominantly influenced by an individual's intention to use it, which is influenced {{by his or her}} attitudes toward it (Davis, 1989). Presently, the key factors that impact the use of personal robots are not fully understood. Two studies were conducted as first step assessments of the Smarr, Fisk, and Rogers (2013) theoretically-based framework <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> personal robots. In study 1, 14 participants used a personal robot (a robot lawn mower) at their homes for about six weeks. Their acceptance and factors important for acceptance identified in the framework were measured using pre-use and post-use interviews and questionnaires, and weekly diaries. The framework was conceptually validated; participants mentioned 16 of the 20 factors in the Smarr et al. (2013) framework. However, the framework did not fully account for the breadth of factors discussed by participants, thereby suggesting variables may need to be added to or removed from the framework. In study 2, 280 participants reported their initial <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> a personal robot (a robot mower) with different levels <b>of</b> reliability and <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> feedback in an online survey. Level of robot reliability did significantly affect attitudinal and intentional acceptance. Follow up analyses indicated a trend that participants who received no information on reliability had numerically higher acceptance than participants who were informed that the robot had 70 % reliability or 90 % reliability. Neither <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> feedback nor its interaction with reliability affected acceptance. The Smarr et al. (2013) framework explained about 60 % of the variance in intentional acceptance and 57 % in attitudinal <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> a personal robot. Eight of the 15 relationships tested were supported via path analysis. Findings largely supported the Smarr et al. (2013) framework in explaining what impacts intentional and attitudinal <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> a personal robot. Results from these studies can inform the Smarr et al. (2013) framework <b>of</b> robot <b>acceptance</b> and other models <b>of</b> <b>acceptance,</b> and can guide designers in developing acceptable personal robots. Ph. D...|$|R
50|$|The {{court ruled}} that Felthouse did not have {{ownership}} of the horse as there was no <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the contract. <b>Acceptance</b> must be communicated clearly and cannot be imposed due to silence {{of one of the}} parties. The uncle had no right to impose a sale through silence whereby the contract would only fail by repudiation. Though the nephew expressed interest in completing the sale there was no <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> that intention.|$|R
