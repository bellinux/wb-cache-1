The method makes use of a novel current source that is able to pro-duce nearly arbitrary current shapes. With it, it is possible to derive the stationary and transient arc characteristic independent of each other but within one experiment. The arcs under investigation are aimed for application in HVDC circuit breakers with passive resonance principle. The example shown in this contribution, an arc axially blown with air at pblow = 1. 5 bar, nicely demonstrates the power of this novel characterization method. 1...|$|R
40|$|A new two-contact {{system with}} double-transversal {{magnetic}} field (TMF) structure is investigated regarding {{its potential for}} high current interruption. It consists of two concentric TMF contacts, in which the inner contact has a disk-shaped structure (spiral contact) and the outer contact a cup-shaped structure. This contact assembly gives several advantages {{over the use of}} single-TMF contacts, as the <b>constricted</b> high-current <b>arc</b> might either split between both inner and outer contacts or commute from the inner to the outer contact and continue its rotation. In both scenarios, we expect a better distribution of the arc energy over a larger contact surface. B-field simulation and Lorentz force calculation are carried out to investigate whether two <b>constricted</b> <b>arcs,</b> with one burning on the inner contact and the other on the outer contact, can coexist given their mutual attraction. Single-phase high current interruption tests were carried out to compare the performance of this new double-TMF contact system with that of a standard spiral-type single-TMF one. These tests have revealed superior performance of the new double-TMF contact system, which could interrupt current amplitude at least 20 % higher than the one interrupted by the single-TMF contact system...|$|R

50|$|Plasma {{arc welding}} (PAW) is an arc welding process similar to gas {{tungsten}} arc welding (GTAW). The electric arc is formed between an electrode (which is usually {{but not always}} made of sintered tungsten) and the workpiece. The key difference from GTAW is that in PAW, by positioning the electrode within the body of the torch, the plasma arc can be separated from the shielding gas envelope. The plasma is then forced through a fine-bore copper nozzle which <b>constricts</b> the <b>arc</b> and the plasma exits the orifice at high velocities (approaching the speed of sound) and a temperature approaching 28,000 °C (50,000 °F) or higher.|$|R
5000|$|Non-transferred arc process: The arc {{is formed}} between the electrode(-) {{and the water}} cooled <b>constricting</b> nozzle(+). <b>Arc</b> plasma {{comes out of the}} nozzle as a flame. The arc is {{independent}} of the work piece and the work piece does not form a part of the electrical circuit. Just like an arc flame (as in atomic hydrogen welding), it can be moved {{from one place to another}} and can be better controlled. The non transferred plasma arc possesses comparatively less energy density as compared to a transferred arc plasma and it is employed for welding and in applications involving ceramics or metal plating (spraying). High density metal coatings can be produced by this process. A non-transferred arc is initiated by using a high frequency unit in the circuit.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} advancements in the modelling, optimisation, {{process control}} and mechanical performance of novel high deposition rate {{gas metal arc}} welding processes for large scale additive manufacturing applications. One of the main objectives {{of this study was to}} develop fundamental understanding of the mechanisms involved during processing with particular focus on single layer welds made of carbon steel using both pulsed-current {{gas metal arc welding}} and cold metal transfer processes. The effects of interactions between critical welding process variables and weld bead and plate fusion characteristics are studied for single and multi-layers. It was shown that several bead and plate fusion characteristics are strongly affected by the contact tip to work distance, TRIM, wire feed speed, wire feed speed to travel speed ratio, and wire diameter in pulsed-current gas metal arc welding. The arc-length control, dynamic correction and the contact tip to work distance are shown to strongly influence the weld bead geometry in the cold metal transfer process. This fundamental knowledge was essential to ensure the successful development of predictive interaction models capable of determining the weld bead geometry from the welding process parameters. The models were developed using the least-squares analysis and multiple linear regression method. The gas tungsten <b>constricted</b> <b>arc</b> welding process was utilised for the first time for out-of-chamber fabrication of a large scale and high-quality Ti- 6 Al- 4 V component. The main focus was, however, in the use of the cold metal transfer process for improving out-of-chamber deposition of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V at much higher deposition rates. The effect of the cold metal transfer process on the grain refinement features in the fusion zone of single layer welds under different torch gas shielding conditions was investigated. It was shown that significant grain refinement occurs with increasing helium content. The morphological features and static mechanical performance of the resulting multi-layered Ti- 6 Al- 4 V walls were also examined and compared with those in gas tungsten <b>constricted</b> <b>arc</b> welding. The results show that a considerable improvement in static tensile properties is obtained in both testing directions with cold metal transfer over gas tungsten <b>constricted</b> <b>arc</b> welding. It was suggested that this improvement in the mechanical behaviour could be due to the formation of more fine-grained structures,which are therefore more isotropic. The average ultimate tensile strength and yield strength of the as-deposited Ti- 6 Al- 4 V material processed via cold metal transfer meet the minima specification values recommended for most Ti- 6 Al- 4 V products. Neutron diffraction technique was used to establish the effect of repeated thermo-mechanical cycling on the generation, evolution and distribution of residual stresses during wire and arc additive manufacturing. The results show a significant redistribution of longitudinal residual stresses along both the substrate and multi-bead with repeated deposition. However, a nearly complete relaxation occurs along the built, once the base plate constraint is removed...|$|E

Physical features of plasma generation in such system are discussed. Special features of the electron emitter design provide a long lifetime due to decrease of arc cathode erosion rate, as well as decrease of contamination of gaseous plasma by metal ions, atoms and particles. The discharge voltage is 20 – 150 V and the discharge current is up to 20 A in DC mode. It is shown that simultaneous operating of three discharge systems provides for-mation of uniform and stable gaseous plasma in the volume of 1 m 3 with plasma density up to 1011 cm– 3 at operating gas pressure in the vacuum chamber of 10 – 3 torr.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} modified cathode assemblies, {{including their}} main characteristics, for plasma electron sources {{based on a}} <b>constricted</b> low-pressure <b>arc</b> initiated by a discharge in crossed electric and magnetic fields. One of the modified cathode assemblies allows the electrode system of the auxiliary discharge to operate at a pressure of≈ 0. 3 Pa, as against ≈ 10 Pa before the modification, provides a larger diameter constriction of the pulsed (up to [tau]= 250 [mu]s) arc, and thus extends the range of operating currents for the plasma-cathode discharge system up to I[d]= 300 A. The other modified assembly operates at widely varying discharge currents I[d]= 5 - 100 A, provides lesser amounts of cathode microdroplets at the discharge electrodes, and allows the arc to operate at comparatively low voltages. The use of cathode assemblies adapted for specific discharge systems extends the capabilities of plasma- emitter electron sources {{as well as the}} range of their applications in scientific and technological fields...|$|R
5000|$|Transferred arc process: The arc {{is formed}} between the electrode(-) {{and the work}} piece(+). In other words, arc is {{transferred}} from the electrode to the work piece. A transferred arc possesses high energy density and plasma jet velocity. For this reason it is employed to cut and melt metals. Besides carbon steels this process can cut stainless steel and nonferrous metals where an oxyacetylene torch does not succeed. Transferred arc {{can also be used}} for welding at high arc travel speeds. For initiating a transferred arc, a current limiting resistor is put in the circuit, which permits a flow of about 50 amps, between the nozzle and electrode and a pilot arc is established between the electrode and the nozzle. As the pilot arc touches the job main current starts flowing between electrode and job, thus igniting the transferred arc. The pilot arc initiating unit gets disconnected and pilot arc extinguishes as soon as the arc between the electrode and the job is started. The temperature of a <b>constricted</b> plasma <b>arc</b> may be of the order of 8000 - 25000°C.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} performed to evaluate arc jet operation at low power. A standard, 1 kW, <b>constricted</b> <b>arc</b> jet was run using nozzles with three different constrictor diameters. Each nozzle was run over a range of current and mass flow rates to explore stability and performance in the low power engine. A standard pulse-width modulated power processor was modified to accommodate the high operating voltages required under certain conditions. Stable, reliable operation at power levels below 0. 5 kW was obtained at efficiencies between 30 and 40 percent. The operating range {{was found to be}} somewhat dependent on constrictor geometry at low mass flow rates. Quasi-periodic voltage fluctuations were observed at the low power end of the operating envelope, The nozzle insert geometry was found to have little effect on the performance of the device. The observed performance levels show that specific impulse levels above 350 seconds can be obtained at the 0. 5 kW power level...|$|E
40|$|Arc plasma {{possesses}} a constriction phenomenon with a pulsed current. The constriction {{is created by}} the Lorentz force, the radial electromagnetic force during arc welding, which determines the energy distribution of the arc plasma. Welding experiments were carried out with ultra-high-frequency pulsed arc welding (UHFP-AW). Ultra-high-speed camera observations were produced for arc surveillance. Hue-saturation-intensity (HSI) image {{analysis was used to}} distinguish the regions of the arc plasma that represented the heat energy distribution. The measurement of arc regions indicated that, with an ultra-high-frequency pulsed arc, the constriction was not only within the decreased arc geometry, but also within the <b>constricted</b> <b>arc</b> core region. This can be checked by the ratio of the core region to the total area. The arc core region expanded significantly at 40 kHz at 60 A. A current level of 80 A caused a decrease in the total region of the arc. Meanwhile, the ratio of the core region to the total increased. It can be concluded that arc constriction depends on the increased area of the core region with the pulsed current (> 20 kHz) ...|$|E
40|$|Vacuum interrupters {{based on}} {{transverse}} magnetic field contacts now {{are widely used}} in medium voltage circuit breakers. The arc motion under the transverse magnetic field (TMF) plays a decisive role in the interruption. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} movement of vacuum arc driven by TMF and anode thermal process during the arcing. Then, based on the principle of conservation, a transient two-dimensional anode activity model (subjected to TMF <b>constricted</b> <b>arc)</b> is established. The state change of material, evaporation from contacts and motion of molten pool are also considered in our model. By considering the arc motion in the anode activity model, the transient anode thermal process and the movement of constrict arc under TMF are studied, respectively. The simulation predicted that average speed of arc is not higher than 200 m/s. In the simulation, the anode surface is completely melted near the current peak with 200 μm molten layer. In addition, the influence of movement of molten pool on the arc speed is analyzed, finding that the movement of the bath accelerates arc speed, but weakens the surface melting at the same time...|$|E
40|$|Additional {{constriction}} of the arc in {{plasma arc}} welding has been investigated. By additionally <b>constricting</b> the <b>arc,</b> the power density at the work piece can be increased. If successful, {{it is hoped that}} this increase will approach values achieved in laser beam welding {{at a fraction of the}} costs of the latter. A survey of the available literature on {{plasma arc welding}} was made. An experimental torch incorporating facilities for additional constriction was custom-designed and built. Experiments with an arc on a non-melting anode were carried out to assess the functioning of the experimental torch, explore the possibility of additional arc constriction and assess some of the changes to the arc as a result. Subsequently, preliminary keyhole welding trials were executed to determine the performance of the experimental torch under welding conditions and to obtain a first indication of the effect of additional arc constriction on a keyhole weld. Additional constriction of the arc in plasma arc welding has been proven to be possible. The power density was increased by a factor of two.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present in}} this paper a {{magnetohydrodynamic}} (MHD) modelling of the gliding arc behaviour of a dc plasma torch operating with air under low current and high voltage conditions. The low current leads to instabilities and difficulties with simulating the process because the magnetic field {{is not sufficient to}} <b>constrict</b> the <b>arc.</b> The model is 3 D, time dependent and the MHD equations are solved using CFD software Code_Saturne®. Although the arc is definitively non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), the LTE assumption is considered as a first approach. The injection of air is tangential. A hot gas channel reattachment model has been used to simulate the restriking process of the arc root. After the description of the model, the most appropriate electrical voltage breakdown parameter has been selected in comparing with experimental results. A typical operating point is then studied in detail and shows the helical shape of the arc discharge in the nozzle. Finally, the mass flow rate and the current have been varied in the range 0. 16 - 0. 5 g s− 1 and 100 - 300 mA, respectively, corresponding to typical glidarc operating points of our experimental plasma torch.

Accompanying these developments has come the need for suitable underwater repair and uainten-nce techniques. one such technique {{involves the use of}} fusion welding processes in localised dry high pressure environments created around weldments. Pressure chambers at Cranfield have been employed to simulate this sitiu. ation. These have been used to investigate the influence of ambient pressure (1 to 45 bars) on gas-tungsten arcs. The study has been of a basic nature with emphasis on arc characteristics and arc structure. Special attention is given to the argon TIG arc although helium TIG <b>arcs</b> and <b>constricted</b> argon-tungsten <b>arcs</b> have also been examined. Arc characteristics are reported in terms of arc appearance and modes, electrical characteristics and weld bead studies. The investigation of arc structure is concerned with gaining an understanding of observed characteristics. This has involved experimental and theoretical developments. Experimental techniques used include, electrostatic probes, calorimetry and the measurement of total power radiated from an arc. Models developed here have successfully explained many of the experimental findings and special emphasis has been directed at understanding gas flow in the column and arc stability. Much of the work included in this thesis has implications for the development of underwater welding procedures. Results presented should also contribute to gaining a better understanding of arcs operating under normal ambient conditions.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} two phase program is to conduct the development research required to make the low power arcjet a flight ready technology. Many important results were obtained during Phase 1 to move closer to this objective. Fundamental analyses were performed of the arcjet nozzle, the gas kinetic reaction effects, the thermal environment, and the arc stabilizing vortex. These aided the conceptual understanding of the arcjet and guided design work. A hydrazine (N 2 H 4) arcjet was designed that combined a flight qualified catalyst bed with a modular arcjet. Extensive testing was performed which demonstrated the feasibility of using this propellant in an arcjet for the first time. Startup techniques were developed, stability maintained, material compatibility tests conducted, and performance mapping tests performed. Specific impulse values from 400 to 730 seconds were produced with a non-optimized design. These levels are higher than were originally thought possible and proved that extremely high enthalpy values can be obtained with <b>constricted</b> <b>arc</b> technology. Erosion rate data are promising for lifetime extensions to meet flight application requirements. Power control unit (PCU) development was started with the design and fabrication of a laboratory high switching frequency supply. Valuable data were obtained on PCU operation and on the interaction with the dynamic arc.

40|$|Recently, a {{constricted}} attachment of an {{atmospheric pressure}} low-current argon arc in {{the centre of}} the flat end face of a thoriated tungsten cathode was observed and spectroscopically analysed. Its diameter of 0. 6 mm and its length of the free standing part of 10 mm are the typical dimensions of electrodes for high-intensity discharge lamps. This paper gives a physical interpretation of the axially symmetric arc spot by a simulation of its properties with a cathodic sheath model which takes into account a reduction in the work function above a critical temperature of the cathode surface by a thorium ion current. At first the optical observation and spectroscopic investigations are recapitulated. Then, an overview is given on the essential elements which are needed to simulate the cathodic arc attachment on a hot electrode. A simulation of a central cathode spot with these elements gives results which are far away from the experimental findings if a constant work function φ is used. Therefore, a temperature-dependent work function φ(T) is introduced. This φ(T) transitions from 4. 55 to 3 eV above temperatures of the order of 3000 K. With this emitter spot model a <b>constricted</b> <b>arc</b> attachment is obtained by simulation in {{the centre of the}} flat end face of the cathode in accordance with experiment. For currents below iarc,max ≈ 15. 5 A, two spot solutions with different cathode falls are found. They form a current–voltage–characteristic consisting of two branches which extend from a turning point at iarc,max to lower currents. For iarc > iarc,max, only a diffuse mode of cathodic arc attachment is obtained. It is shown by a comparison with measured data for iarc = 7. 5, 10, 12. 5 and 15 A that the solution with the lower cathode fall is observed experimentally...|$|E
40|$|Arcjet {{thrusters}} {{are being}} actively considered {{for use in}} Earth orbit maneuvering applications. Experimental studies are currently the chief means of determining an optimal thruster configuration. Earlier numerical studies have failed to include all of the effects found in typical arcjets including complex geometries, viscosity, and swirling flow. Arcjet geometries are large area ratio converging nozzles with centerbodies in the subsonic portion of the nozzle. The nozzle walls serve as the anode while the centerbody functions as the cathode. Viscous effects are important because the Reynolds number, based on the throat radius, is typically less than 1, 000. Experimental {{studies have shown that}} a swirl or circumferential velocity component stabilizes a <b>constricted</b> <b>arc.</b> This dissertation describes the equations governing flow through a constricted arcjet thruster. An assumption that the flowfield is in local thermodynamic equilibrium leads to a single fluid plasma temperature model. An order of magnitude analysis reveals the governing fluid mechanics equations are uncoupled from the electromagnetic field equations. A numerical method is developed to solve the governing fluid mechanics equations, the Thin Layer Navier-Stokes equations. A coordinate transformation is employed in deriving the governing equations to simplify the application of boundary conditions in complex geometries. An axisymmetric formulation is employed to include the swirl velocity component as well as the axial and radial velocity components. The numerical method is an implicit finite-volume technique and allows for large time steps to reach a converged steady-state solution. The inviscid fluxes are flux-split, and Gauss-Seidel line relaxation is used to accelerate convergence. Converging-diverging nozzles with exit-to-throat area ratios up to 100 : 1 and annular nozzles were examined. Quantities examined included Mach number and static wall pressure distributions, and oblique shock structures. As the level of swirl and viscosity in the flowfield increased the mass flow rate and thrust decreased. The technique was used to predict the flow through a typical arcjet thruster geometry.

40|$|A MW-class {{electrothermal}} arcjet {{based on}} a water-cooled, wall-stabilized, <b>constricted</b> <b>arc</b> discharge configuration was subjected to extensive performance testing using hydrogen and simulated ammonia propellants with the deliberate aim of advancing technology readiness level for potential space propulsion applications. The breadboard design incorporates alternating conductor/insulator wafers to form a discharge barrel enclosure with a 2. 5 -cm internal bore diameter and an overall length of approximately 1 meter. Swirling propellant flow is introduced into the barrel, and a DC arc discharge mode is established between a backplate tungsten cathode button and a downstream ringanode/ spin-coil assembly. The arc-heated propellant then enters a short mixing plenum and is accelerated through a converging-diverging graphite nozzle. This innovative design configuration differs substantially from conventional arcjet thrusters, in which the throat functions as constrictor and the expansion nozzle serves as the anode, and permits the attainment of an equilibrium sonic throat (EST) condition. During the test program, applied electrical input power was varied between 0. 5 - 1 MW with hydrogen and simulated ammonia flow rates {{in the range of}} 4 - 12 g/s and 15 - 35 g/s, respectively. The ranges of investigated specific input energy therefore fell between 50 - 250 MJ/kg for hydrogen and 10 - 60 MJ/kg for ammonia. In both cases, observed arc efficiencies were between 40 - 60 percent as determined via a simple heat balance method based on electrical input power and coolant water calorimeter measurements. These experimental results were found to be in excellent agreement with theoretical chemical equilibrium predictions, thereby validating the EST assumption and enabling the utilization of standard TDK nozzle expansion analyses to reliably infer baseline thruster performance characteristics. Inferred specific impulse performance accounting for recombination kinetics during the expansion process implied nearly frozen flow in the nozzle and yielded performance ranges of 800 - 1100 sec for hydrogen and 400 - 600 sec for ammonia. Inferred thrust-to-power ratios were in the range of 30 - 10 lbf/MWe for hydrogen and 60 - 20 lbf/MWe for ammonia. Successful completion of this test series represents a fundamental milestone in the progression of high power arcjet technology, and it is hoped that the results may serve as a reliable touchstone for the future development of MW-class regeneratively-cooled flex-propellant plasma rockets...|$|E
