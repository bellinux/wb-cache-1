40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{experimental}} measurement was determination of relation among weight load of the tractor together, <b>hitch</b> <b>height</b> changes and drawbar characteristic. The measurement was realized on chassis dynamometer at MUAF in Brno. The first step consisted of rated speed characteristics measurement in conformity with OECD demands. The drawbar characteristic was measured under two selected gears. Adding 980 kg to the nominal wight of the tractor brought increasing maximal drawbar power and drawbar force together with decreasing of slip. The highest differences were observed during the mesurement of fifth gear shifted. The drawbar force grew up to 18. 9 % {{as well as the}} maximal drawbar power (15. 2 %). The maximal drawbar power at ninth gear gave 62. 8 kW. The <b>hitch</b> <b>height</b> was setting to 0. 54 m; 0. 64 m and 0. 74 m. When the <b>hitch</b> <b>height</b> was set from 0. 54 m to 0. 74 m the drawbar force an power on front axle was lower by reason of load reduction. As can be noticed from the final drawbar characteristics, both curves are identical up to border of maximal drawbar power. Small differences {{in the area of the}} highest slips can be ascribed to the rolling resistance...|$|R
50|$|The song is {{the story}} of two drifters, the narrator and his girlfriend Bobby McGee. The <b>couple</b> <b>hitch</b> a ride from a truck driver and sing as they drive through the American south. They visit California and then part ways, with the song's narrator expressing his sadness after her departure.|$|R

50|$|Lochy's life {{is placed}} in danger when she decides to wag school {{and go to the}} beach with Ryan and his girlfriend, Tania (Angela Nicholls). The <b>couple</b> <b>hitch</b> a lift with Kerry's husband Joe Mangel (Mark Little) and Lochy sneaks onto the back of Joe's ute. Ryan and Tania are angry when they find her. Lochy asks Tania to call her school and pretend she is sick. Ryan then tells Lochy to leave them alone, so he and Tania can be alone. Lochy gets into {{difficulty}} in the water, having gone out alone and Ryan pulls her to safety. Lochy is unconscious, but some lifeguards give her CPR and she comes around. Lochy tells everyone to blame her for the accident instead of Ryan, but Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) sacks Ryan from the Coffee Shop. Lochy protests outside the shop, outraging Harold. The Erinsborough News turn up and Harold agrees to re-instate Ryan.|$|R
50|$|While at UCLA {{she became}} {{politically}} active, designing posters for the UCLA chapter NAACP and eventually became its corresponding secretary. In June 1959, she met and became romantically linked with Jerry Gerowitz. She left school {{and moved in}} with him, {{for the first time}} having her own studio space. The <b>couple</b> <b>hitch</b> hiked to New York in 1959, just as Chicago's mother and brother moved to Los Angeles to be closer to her. The couple lived in Greenwich Village for a time, before returning in 1960 from Los Angeles to Chicago so she could finish her degree. Chicago married Gerowitz in 1961. She graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1962 and {{was a member of the}} Phi Beta Kappa Society. Gerowitz died in a car crash in 1963, devastating Chicago and causing her to suffer from an identity crisis until later that decade. She received her Master of Fine Arts from UCLA in 1964.|$|R
60|$|The boy {{did as he}} was bid, {{placing his}} hands behind him when Paulvitch told him to do so. Instantly the old man slipped the running noose over one of the lad's wrists, took a <b>couple</b> of half <b>hitches</b> about his other wrist, and knotted the cord.|$|R
50|$|Claire, {{recovering}} from the paralysis, barely manages to shut the tap off in time to save herself from drowning. When she regains her strength, she finds that Norman is missing from the bathroom floor. She crawls {{down the stairs to}} the phone, and notices Norman apparently unconscious, his head bleeding profusely. As she reaches over him and attempts to make a phone call, he grabs her ankle and in a blind panic she rushes out of the house, grabbing the car keys and a cellular phone and driving away in a truck with the <b>couple's</b> sailboat <b>hitched</b> to the back. As she is crossing the bridge over Lake Champlain, Norman bursts through the back window and grabs Claire; she frantically dials 911 and the truck careens down the embankment into the lake.|$|R
60|$|For answer Ernest tied {{a bit of}} {{driftwood}} to {{the rope}} {{and put it into}} Laddie's mouth. The next minute the dog was swimming out to me. As soon as he came close I caught the rope. It was just long enough to stretch from shore to rock, allowing for a <b>couple</b> of <b>hitches</b> which Ernest gave around a small boulder on the ledge. I tied my camera case on my head by means of some string I found in my pocket, then I slipped into the water and, holding to the rope, went hand over hand to the shore with Laddie swimming beside me. Ernest held on to the shoreward end of the rope like grim death, a task that was no light one for his small arms. When I finally scrambled up beside him, his face was dripping with perspiration and he trembled like a leaf.|$|R
40|$|The full-Automatic Quick <b>Hitch</b> <b>Coupling</b> Device (full-AQHCD for short) {{is used as}} the {{starting}} point, key technologies in a large-scale rescue robot wrist, which is constituted by integrating a quick <b>hitch</b> <b>coupling</b> device, a turning device, and a swaying device together, are reviewed respectively. Firstly, the semi-AQHCD made domestically for the main-Arm Claw Wrist (main-ACW for short) is introduced, and the full-AQHCD imported from Oil Quick company in Sweden for the vice-Arm Cutter Wrist (vice-ACW for short) is presented. Secondly, aiming at three key technologies in the full-AQHCD including rotary joint technology, automatic docking technology and precise docking technology for quick action coupling, are concisely expressed. Thirdly, the hydraulic motor driving gear type slewing bearing technology of the turning device made domestically for the main-ACW is introduced, and the hydraulic motor driving worm type slewing bearing technology of the turning device imported from HKS company in Germany for the vice-ACW is presented, especially, the existing gap in the similar domestic technology is discussed. Subsequently, the hydraulic cylinder driving 4 -bar linkage technology of the swaying device made domestically for the main-ACW is introduced, and the hydraulic double spiral swing cylinder technology of the swaying device imported from HKS company in Germany for the vice-ACW is presented, especially, the existing gap in the similar domestic technology is discussed. Finally, it is emphasized that these technological gaps have seriously restricted {{the ability of the}} vice-ACW to successfully work in future actual rescue combats, therefore, it must be highly valued in the follow-up research and development (R&D) through cooperating with professional manufacturers in China, thereby making technological advances...|$|R
500|$|The English {{version of}} First Departure {{received}} mixed to average reviews, earning a 77% rating on GameRankings and a 74 out of 100 average from Metacritic. Many reviewers felt {{that despite the}} updated graphics and sound, the game still felt less refined than more modern role-playing games. IGN found the game to have a [...] "bland, awkwardly-told narrative" [...] with [...] "weak characters", but that it would appeal to fans of older games, stating [...] "If {{you can look at}} First Departure and understand that it's based on a very old title, you'll likely be able to overlook the problems and get a fair amount of satisfaction". GameSpot also stated that the title had [...] "limited appeal" [...] in addition to providing little challenge. Andrew Fitch of 1UP.com, however, called First Departure an [...] "overlooked classic" [...] with [...] "ridiculously engrossing crafting minutiae" [...] and numerous character party combinations that increase its replay value. GameSpy would additionally declare that [...] "Despite a <b>couple</b> of minor <b>hitches,</b> Star Ocean: First Departure {{is one of the best}} remakes Square Enix has brought to portable consoles." ...|$|R
