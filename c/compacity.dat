40|$|International audienceThe {{structure}} of silica-latex nanocomposites of three matrix chain masses (20, 50, and 160 kg/mol of poly(ethyl methacrylate)) are studied using a SAXS/TEM approach, coupled via Monte Carlo simulations of scattering of fully polydisperse silica nanoparticle aggregates. At low silica concentrations (1 vol. %), {{the impact of}} the matrix chain mass on the structure is quantified in terms of the aggregation number distribution function, highest mass leading to individual dispersion, whereas the lower masses favor the formation of small aggregates. Both simulations for SAXS and TEM give compatible aggregate <b>compacities</b> around 10 vol. %, indicating that the construction algorithm for aggregates is realistic. Our results on structure are rationalized in terms of the critical collision time between nanoparticles due to diffusion in viscous matrices. At higher concentrations, aggregates overlap and form a percolated network, with a smaller and lighter mesh in the presence of high mass polymers. The linear rheology is investigated with oscillatory shear experiments. It shows a feature related to the silica structure at low frequencies, the amplitude of which can be described by two power laws separated by the percolation threshold of aggregates...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of wall effects on particle separation in an air jigging device. Tests were conducted with a ternary mixture of concrete, brick and gypsum particles in the size range from 12 to 20 mm for three different jigging times. It is shown that an unusual, remarkable segregation occurred in the direction perpendicular to the lateral walls, giving rise to a horizontal segregation pattern. In all cases, heavier particles concentrated more {{in the center of}} the particle bed while lighter particles concentrated along the side walls. Composition measurements of the stratified bed revealed that wall effects can significantly influence the composition of jig products. Linear predictions of jigging evolution suggest that stratification progress linearly after the first initial stages. Also, time evolution and analysis of local <b>compacities</b> indicate that stratification starts from the bottom to the upper layers of particle bed. Based on the experimental results, a mechanism for the pattern formation was proposed, which was enhanced by a geometry model of bed rearrangement. Prediction results for bed composition correlated well with experimental data and endorsed the role of lateral walls on the segregation pattern formed. The results obtained also show practical significance for the use of air jigging in the sorting of recycled aggregates...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSimplified silica (Zeosil 1165 MP) and SBR (140 k {{carrying}} silanol end-groups) nanocomposites {{have been}} formulated by mixing of a reduced number of ingredients {{with respect to}} industrial applications. The thermo-mechanical history of the samples during the mixing process was monitored and adjusted to identical final temperatures. The filler structure on large scales up to micrometers was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and very small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). A complete quantitative model extending from the primary silica nanoparticle (of radius ‚âà 10 nm), to nanoparticles aggregates, up to micrometer-sized branches with typical lateral dimension of 150 nm is proposed. Image analysis of the TEM-pictures yields the fraction of zones of pure polymer, which extend between {{the branches of a}} large-scale filler network. This network is compatible with a fractal of average dimension 2. 4 as measured by scattering. On smaller length scales, inside the branches, small silica aggregates are present. Their average radius has been deduced from a Kratky analysis, and it ranges between 35 and 40 nm for all silica fractions investigated here (Œ¶si = 8 ‚àí 21 % vol.). A central piece of our analysis is the description of the interaggregate interaction by a simulated structure factor for polydisperse spheres representing aggregates. A polydispersity of 30 % in aggregate size is assumed, and interactions between these aggregates are described with a hard core repulsive potential. The same distribution in size is used to evaluate the polydisperse form factor. Comparison with the experimental intensity leads to the determination of the average aggregate <b>compacity</b> (assumed identical for all aggregates in the distribution, between 31 % and 38 % depending on Œ¶si), and thus aggregation number (ca. 45, with a large spread). Because of the effect of aggregate <b>compacity</b> and of pure polymer zones, the volume fraction of aggregates is higher in the branches than Œ¶si. The repulsion between aggregates has a strong effect on the apparent isothermal compressibility: it leads to a characteristic low-q depression, which cannot be interpreted as aggregate mass decrease in our data. In addition, the reinforcement effect of these silica structures in the SBR-matrix is characterized with oscillatory shear and described with a model based on the same aggregate <b>compacity.</b> Finally, our results show {{that it is possible to}} analyze the complex structure of interacting aggregates in nanocomposites of industrial origin in a self-consistent and quantitative manner...|$|E

This is done in a general setting in which <b>compacity</b> arguments cannot be used, and for which there does not always exist an optimal control. Second, we prove that these processes lead to viscosity solutions for semi linear second-order partial differential equations with convex generator. Finally we give an application to mathematical finance. We show that our results allow {{for the construction of a}} No Arbitrage Pricing Procedure in the context of stochastic volatility. Within this approach, convexity takes into account liquidy risk...|$|E
