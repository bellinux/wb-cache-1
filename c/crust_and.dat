40|$|In {{semi-arid}} Kenya, {{the most}} dominatn soil types are of limited agricultural productivity due to <b>crusting</b> <b>and</b> compaction. The occurence of soil <b>crusting</b> <b>and</b> compaction {{is attributed to}} seasonal rainfall characteristics, physical soil properties and bad tillage practices. Soil <b>crusting</b> <b>and</b> compaction decrease rain water infiltration and increase surface runoff.

The objective of this sturdy {{was to examine the}} hydrological effects of two tillage practices with and without framyard manure on surface runoff and soil loss of <b>crusting</b> <b>and</b> compacting soils under field conditions at Katumani in semi-arid Kenya. Field investigtions on rainfall characteristics, surface runoff, soil loss, soil bulk density and soil sherar strengh covered two rainy seasons (short and long ranis) and were done on a Chromic Luvisol. etc. Key words: zero tillage, conventional tillage, farmyard manure, <b>crusting</b> <b>and</b> compacting soils, semi arid Kenya...|$|R

ISSN 0213 - 6937. The Middle-Upper Jurassic {{transition}} {{within the}} External Subbetic (Betic Cordillera) and the Jbel Moussa Group (Rifian Calcareous Chain) is characterised by numerous stratigraphic breaks recorded as palaeoreliefs, omission surfaces and hardgrounds. The features {{and number of}} unconformities {{vary depending on the}} domain studied and the tectonic unit. One common characteristic is the presence of microbial Fe-Mn <b>crusts</b> <b>and</b> Mn <b>crusts.</b> Three different contexts of microbially mediated Fe-Mn crusts can be distinguished: a) hydrogenetic surficial Fe-Mn <b>crusts</b> <b>and</b> macro-oncoids, b) hydrogenetic cryptic Fe-Mn <b>crusts,</b> <b>and</b> c) hydrothermal surficial Mn crusts. The surficial Fe-Mn <b>crusts</b> <b>and</b> macro-oncoids are hydrogenetic crusts related to the chemo-organotrophic behaviour of the benthic microbial communities in the External Subbetic. Encrusting foraminifera (Thurammina, Placops-ilina, Tolypammina and nubeculariids) and fungi fed on bacteria, while the bacteria and fungi took advantage of the nutrient-rich foraminiferal excretions.

Finally, the mixing of magma chamber contents with new and more mafic magma shortly before each eruption {{played an important role in}} rock genesis. In the case of Lastarria, this mixing occurs in a stratified magma chamber, with active convection occurring between lighter and colder upper contents and hotter and denser lower contents.|$|E

5|$|Cerro Blanco {{is part of}} the Central Volcanic Zone and {{is located}} at the {{southern}} limit of the Puna.

Rocks beneath this unit include dacitic–trachyandesitic volcanites 9–7 mya old and an igneous-metamorphic granitic basement containing orthogneiss, quartz of Neoproterozoic-early Paleozoic age, containing paleozoic mafic to ultramafic volcanic inclusions. The Cordillera de San Buenaventura is formed from lava domes and volcanic complexes of intermediary composition of Upper Miocene–Quaternary age. During the Miocene-Pleistocene, the isotope and chemical composition of areal magmas has moved away from arc like magmas to distinctly water-poor and unoxidized petrologies.
