30|$|Therefore, {{in order}} to recover the {{residual}} oil, utilization of tertiary oil recovery procedures which are mainly gas or <b>chemical</b> <b>injections</b> {{and the use of}} thermal recovery are essential. Past experiences demonstrated that this huge amount of oil remaining in the reservoirs could be recovered effectively by gas-injection methods (Rostami 2009; Rezaveisi et al. 2010; Kulkarni 2005). However, low viscosity of injected gases led to unfavorable mobility ratios and severe gas–oil gravity segregation with large un-swept reservoir volume. Consequently, despite their high microscopic displacement efficiencies, especially under miscible conditions, volumetric sweep efficiency of these EOR processes is their major shortcoming (Hinderaker et al. 1996; Van Pollen 1980). Thus, {{in order to}} improve sweep efficiency of gas-injection processes, water alternating gas (WAG) has been widely practiced with simultaneous decrease of gas consumption. Similarly, unfavorable mobility ratio in addition to the increased mobile water saturation which causes water shielding 1 result in poor recovery in WAG process (Kulkarni and Rao 2006).|$|R

30|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common chronic {{conditions}} in the world today. It results in breakdown of cartilage in joints and causes the patient to experience intense pain and even disability. The pathophysiology of OA is not fully understood; therefore, there is currently no cure for OA. Many researchers are investigating the pathophysiology of the disease and attempting to develop methods to alleviate the symptoms or cure the OA entirely using animal models. Most studies on OA use animal models; this is necessary as the disease develops very slowly in humans and presents differently in each patient. This makes it difficult to effectively study the progression of osteoarthritis. Animal models can be spontaneous, in which OA naturally occurs in the animal. Genetic modifications can be used to make the mice more susceptible to developing OA. Osteoarthritis can also be induced via surgery, <b>chemical</b> <b>injections,</b> or non-invasive trauma. This review aims to describe animal models of inducing osteoarthritis with a focus on the models used on mice and their advantages and disadvantages that each model presents.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the metabosensitive afferent response evoked by electrically induced fatigue (EIF), lactic acid (LA) and potassium chloride (KCl) in three muscle types. We recorded the activity of groups III-IV afferents originating from soleus, gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles. Our data showed a same pattern of response in the three muscles after <b>chemical</b> <b>injections,</b> i. e., a bell curve with maximal discharge rate at 1 mM for LA injections and a linear relationship between KCl concentrations and the afferent discharge rate. Furthermore, a stronger response was recorded after EIF in the gastrocnemius muscle compared to the two other muscles. The change in afferent discharge after 1 mM LA injection was higher for the gastrocnemius muscle compared to the response obtained with the corresponding concentration applied in the two other muscles, whereas changes to KCl injections did not dramatically differ between the three muscles. We conclude that anatomical (mass, phenotype, vascularization, receptor and afferent densityaEuro broken vertical bar) and functional (flexor vs. extensor) differences between muscles could explain the amplitude of these responses...|$|R
