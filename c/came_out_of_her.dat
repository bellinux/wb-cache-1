Wyman and Jeff Pickner {{were both}} impressed with Torv's {{take on the}} role, with Wyman stating that it [...] "just transcended all our expectations", while Pinkner noted that Nimoy himself was [...] "the most proud and most impressed" [...] with the outcome. Actor Joshua Jackson found her performance [...] "so creepy". He explained, [...] "In the episodes, you see I can barely look at her. I think it ended up being {{a good way to}} play Peter’s reaction to Olivia, but it was born out of the fact that when that voice <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> I was like: ‘Oh, that’s just wrong!'" [...] Pinkner confirmed in an interview with TVline that Bell's appearance would last for [...] "a couple" [...] episodes, and also warned that [...] "cohabitation is not as benign as William assumes it is", a reference to problems Bell would soon have in Olivia's body. The possessed state of Olivia has led viewers to refer to her as [...] "Bellivia".|$|E

500|$|Cher made cameo {{appearances}} in the Robert Altman films The Player (1992) and Prêt-à-Porter (1994). In 1994, she started a mail-order catalogue business, Sanctuary, selling Gothic-themed products, and contributed a rock version of [...] "I Got You Babe" [...] to MTV's animated series Beavis and Butt-head. Alongside Chrissie Hynde, Neneh Cherry, and Eric Clapton, she topped the UK Singles Chart in 1995 with the charity single [...] "Love Can Build a Bridge". Later that year, she signed with Warner Music UK's label WEA and released the album It's a Man's World (1995), which <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> idea of covering men's songs from a woman's point of view. In general, critics favored the album and its R influences, some saying her voice had improved. Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that [...] "From an artistic standpoint, this soulful collection of grown-up pop songs... is {{the high point of}} her recording career." [...] It's a Man's World reached number 10 on the UK Albums Chart and spawned the UK top-ten single [...] "One by One". Tracks were remixed for the American release of the album, abandoning its original rock sound in favor of a style more accessible to U.S. radio; it reached number 64 on the Billboard 200.|$|E
500|$|In June 2010, when Jill's adoptive mother, Liz Foster (Julianna McCarthy), died, it {{was then}} learned that her {{biological}} father was Neil Fenmore. Walton stated: [...] "Liz was the dream mother for Jill. She always could handle Jill." [...] During an interview with On-Air On-Soaps speaking about how her character has been thrown in different directions, Walton said: [...] "It used to bother me. I would try and keep a steady course with it, and now I can’t. Now I just roll with the punches. It’s impossible." [...] Walton noted that Jill was finally {{happy to have a}} blood relative through Neil's other daughter, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). She said: [...] "Liz dies within a week {{and all of a sudden}} it’s, 'I am a Fenmore'. And we really didn’t have a chance to explore it much, but in real life that happens. My first thought as Jill is, 'I actually know who my blood is, and I have a sister.' And, Jill was very moved and touched and shocked from the death of Liz, but full of love for her sister." [...] On her relationship with Lauren, Walton stated that, [...] "Most people don’t like Jill, and she hasn’t particularly loved Lauren. I have never had that much to do with Lauren, really." [...] Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted: [...] "The redhead told Jill in no uncertain terms that she intended to keep her father’s memory, and only child status, firmly in tact [...] and had no interest in a close relationship." [...] Borden also noted that Jill always wanted a sense of belonging, which prompted her to legally change her name to Jill Fenmore. The sisters were initially bitter towards each other having to share half of the Fenmore Boutique, but have since gotten closer. Walton said that, [...] "From my point of view, I think that Lauren has a really big heart; she's a naturally lovely person. Lauren was really awful a few times, and that just <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> pain. So, it looks like Lauren and Jill are kind of getting along okay, but there's nothing else coming up in the scripts for them yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lorde's time at Tougaloo College, {{like her}} {{year at the}} National University of Mexico, was a {{formative}} experience for her as an artist. She led workshops with her young, black undergraduate students, {{many of whom were}} eager to discuss the civil rights issues of that time.

2500|$|Alluding to [...] Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said in {{the name}} of Rabbi Jonathan that when a wife summons a husband to his marital duty, they will have {{children}} such as were not to be found even in the generation of Moses. [...] For with regard to the generation of Moses, [...] says, “Take wise men, and understanding and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.” But [...] says, “So I took the chiefs of your tribes, wise men and known,” without mentioning “understanding” (implying that Moses could not find men with understanding). [...] And [...] says, “Issachar is a large-boned donkey” (alluding to the Midrash that Leah heard Jacob's donkey, and so <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> tent to summon Jacob to his marital duty, as reported in [...] ). [...] And 1 Chronicles [...] says, “of the children of Issachar [...] [...] [...] were men who had understanding of the times to know what Israel ought to do.” But the Gemara limited the teaching of Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani {{in the name of}} Rabbi Jonathan by counseling that such behavior is virtuous only when the wife ingratiates herself to her husband without making brazen demands..
