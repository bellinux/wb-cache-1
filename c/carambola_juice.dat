40|$|Response surface {{methodology}} (RSM) {{was employed}} for simultaneous {{analysis of the}} effects of enzymatic treatment conditions of incubation time, incubation temperature and enzyme concentration on physical characteristics such as turbidity, clarity, viscosity, and color. In this study, a two-factor central composite design was used to establish the optimum conditions for the enzymatic treatment for clarification of <b>carambola</b> fruit <b>juice.</b> <b>Carambola</b> fruit <b>juice</b> was treated with pectinase enzyme at different incubation time (20 - 100 min), incubation temperature (30 - 50 Â°C) and enzyme concentration (0. 01 - 0. 10 v/v). These three variables were used as independent variables, whose effects on turbidity, clarity, viscosity and color were evaluated. Significant regression models describing the changes on turbidity, clarity, viscosity and color with respect to the independent variables were established with coefficient of determination, R 2, greater than 0. 70. The results indicated that the enzyme concentration was the most important factor affecting the characteristics of the <b>carambola</b> fruit <b>juice</b> as it exerted a significant influence on most of the dependent variables.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the toxic effect of Averrhoa carambola (star fruit) juice at different storage conditions in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. Twenty female rats weighing 180 &# 177; 20 g were randomly assigned into four groups with five rats per group (n = 5). First group served as the control group, fed with distilled water (vehicle). Second, third and fourth groups were orally treated with juice of A. carambola stored for 0, 1 and 3 h respectively for 14 days. Cage-side observations were done daily after each treatment. Body weight, food consumption and water intake were recorded on day- 0, day- 3, day- 7 and day- 14. All rats were fasted overnight prior to blood collection through cardiac puncture on day- 15. The levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), urea and creatinine in blood serum were measured. Data were analyzed using Dunnett&#x 2032;s test. From the results obtained, there was no lethality found and LD 50 could not be determined. Increment of ALT levels (P < 0. 05) was reported in those rats treated with A. <b>carambola</b> <b>juice</b> stored for 3 h.

40|$|Purpose. To {{examine the}} {{inhibitory}} fruit (Averrhoa <b>carambola)</b> <b>juice</b> towards seven major cytochrome P 450 (CYP) isoforms and NADPH-cytochrome P 450 reductase (CPR). Methods. The inhibitory effects of star fruit juice (0. 5 to 5 %, v/v) against {{the activities of}} seven CYP isoforms including CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 A 6, CYP 2 C 8, CYP 2 C 9, CYP 2 D 6, CYP 2 E 1, CYP 3 A 4 and CPR were examined in human liver microsomes. To identify time-dependent inhibition, star fruit juice (2. 5 %, v/v) was preincubated with microsomes and a NADPH-generating system for 0 - 15 min, and then the extent of inhibition towards seven CYP isoforms were examined. Results. Star fruit juice (5. 0 %, v/v) was found to inhibit all the activities of CYP isoforms tested by more than 70 %. Based on the half inhibition values (%, v/v), the inhibitory effects towards different CYP isoforms were in the following order: CYP 2 A 6 (0. 9) > CYP 1 A 2 (1. 4) > CYP 2 D 6 (1. 6) > CYP 2 E 1 (2. 0) > CYP 2 C 8 (2. 2) > CYP 2 C 9 (3. 0) > CYP 3 A 4 (3. 2). Time-dependent inhibition was not observed towards any of the tested CYP isoforms. In addition, star fruit juice was found not to inhibit the activity of CPR. Conclusions. Star fruit juice inhibited the seven CYP isoforms tested, with the strongest inhibitory effect against CYP 2 A 6 and the least towards CYP 3 A 4...|$|E
40|$|O metabolismo e o transporte intracelular atrav?s das membranas celulares est?o entre os principais processos que regem a cin?tica de f?rmacos em compartimentos fisiol?gicos. A enzima CYP 3 A 4, pertencente ao complexo enzim?tico citocromo P 450, ? respons?vel pelo metabolismo da maioria dos medicamentos atualmente comercializados e ? determinante em muitas intera??es medicamentosas. Al?m dela, o transportador de membrana glicoprote?na-P, da fam?lia ABC, representa outro fator respons?vel pela interfer?ncia na cin?tica de f?rmacos. A intera??o dessas prote?nas com sucos de algumas frutas de outros pa?ses, como a toranja, pode afetar a farmacocin?tica de v?rios medicamentos. No entanto, frutas nativas da regi?o amaz?nica ainda n?o foram alvo desse tipo de investiga??o. Para este estudo, primeiramente, foram determinados os constituintes fitoqu?micos, como polifen?is totais e flavon?ides dos sucos das frutas amaz?nicas a?a?, buriti, camu-camu, cubiu, cupua?u, jenipapo e tapereb?. Foi avaliado, tamb?m, o efeito desses sucos sobre a atividade da P-gP e CYP 3 A 4 utilizando prote?nas humanas recombinantes, bem como a linhagem celular MES-SA/DX e microssomas hep?ticos. O suco de a?a? apresentou o maior teor de polifen?is totais (102, 56 ? 7, 2 ?g EAG/mL) e flavonoides (7, 16 ? 0, 58 ?g EQ/mL). Com rela??o ? capacidade inibit?ria da PgP recombinante, o suco de cupua?u teve a maior taxa. A CYP 3 A 4 foi inibida pelo suco de a?a?, buriti, camu-camu, cubiu e tapereb?, apresentando atividade {{residual}} de 0 %, enquanto o padr?o suco de carambola teve atividade residual de 20 %. Sendo assim, nas concentra??es testadas, os sucos das frutas amaz?nicas tiveram a capacidade de interagir, principalmente, com a CYP 3 A 4 in vitro. No entanto, estudos adicionais devem ser realizados para confirmar estes resultados e esclarecer os mecanismos envolvidos nesse fen?meno. The {{metabolism and}} the intracellular transport through cell membranes {{are among the}} main procedures governing the kinetics of drugs in physiological compartments. The enzyme CYP 3 A 4, which belongs to the cytochrome P 450 enzymatic complex, {{is responsible for the}} metabolism of the majority of drugs currently used and is crucial in many drug-drug interactions. In addition to it, the transporter P-glycoprotein membrane, ABC Family, is another factor responsible for interference in the kinetics of drugs. The interaction of these proteins with juices of some fruits from other countries, for example grapefruit, may affect the pharmacokinetics of many drugs. However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, no investigation has been made evolving fruits from the Amazon region. For this study, first, we determined the phytochemical constituents such as total polyphenols and flavonoids juices of Amazon fruits a?a?, buriti, camu-camu, cubiu, cupua?u, jenipapo and tapereb?. Has been reported, too, the effect of these juices on activity of P-gP and CYP 3 A 4 which employs human recombinant protein and the cell line MES-SA/DX and liver microsomes. The acai juice showed the highest content of total polyphenols (102. 56 ? 7. 2 ?g EAG/mL) and flavonoids (7. 16 ? 0. 58 ?g EQ/mL). Regarding the inhibitory capacity of recombinant P-gP, cupua?u juice had the highest rate. CYP 3 A 4 was strongly inhibited by acai juice, buriti, camu-camu, cubiu and tapereba, with residual activity of 0 %, while the positive control <b>carambola</b> <b>juice</b> had residual activity of 20 %. According, the concentrations tested, the juices of Amazon fruits had the ability to interact mainly with CYP 3 A 4 in vitro. However, further studies should be done to confirm these findings and to clarify the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon...|$|E

50|$|Like the grapefruit, {{carambola}} {{is considered}} to be a potent inhibitor of seven cytochrome P450 isoforms. These enzymes are significant in the first-pass elimination of many medications, and, thus, the consumption of <b>carambola</b> or its <b>juice</b> in combination with certain prescription medications can significantly increase their effective dosage within the body. Research into grapefruit juice (its potent enzymes) for instance, identified a significant effect (requires change in dose or other side effects) on common medications when taken concurrently by the patient, including statins, which are commonly used to treat high cholesterol and cardiovascular illness, opiates/opioids, and benzodiazepines (a sedative tranquilizer drug family that includes diazepam).|$|R
