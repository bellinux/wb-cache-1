Already the simplest versions of the problem are NP-hard so that we cannot expect to find exact polynomial time algorithms. We give constant ratio approximation algorithms for packing axis-parallel (rectangular) cuboids under translation into an axis-parallel (rectangular) cuboid as <b>container,</b> <b>for</b> cuboids under rigid motions into an axis-parallel cuboid or into an arbitrary convex <b>container,</b> and <b>for</b> packing convex polyhedra under rigid motions into an axis-parallel cuboid or arbitrary convex container.
