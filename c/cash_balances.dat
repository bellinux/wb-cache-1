Minting rights were also granted to some princes and officials. By 660, {{deterioration}} of the coinage due to forgery had become a problem. The regulations were reaffirmed in 718, and forgeries suppressed. In 737, the first commissioner with overall responsibility for casting was appointed. In 739, ten mints were recorded, {{with a total of}} 89 furnaces casting some 327,000 strings of cash a year. 123 liang of metal were needed to produce a string of coins weighing 100 liang. In the late 740s, skilled artisans were employed for casting, rather than conscripted peasants. Despite these measures, the coinage continued to deteriorate. In 808, a ban on hoarding coins was proclaimed. This was repeated in 817. Regardless of the rank of a person, they could not hold more than 5,000 strings of cash. <b>Cash</b> <b>balances</b> exceeding this amount had to be expended within two months to purchase goods. This was an attempt to compensate for the lack of cash in circulation. By 834, mint output had fallen to 100,000 strings a year, mainly due to the shortage of copper. Forgeries using lead and tin alloys were produced.|$|E

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{this may not}} be the {{relevant}} comparison. If the alternative to <b>cash</b> <b>balance</b> conversion is that the plan is frozen or terminated (with the vested balance going to the worker), all workers would be much worse off than in a <b>cash</b> <b>balance</b> conversion. This is a realistic possibility; tens of thousands of defined benefit plans have been frozen and/or terminated in the last two decades, far more than have been converted to <b>cash</b> <b>balance</b> plans. Likewise, for the many employees who leave their job before retirement (whether voluntarily or not), many would be better off under the <b>cash</b> <b>balance</b> conversion than under the original defined-benefit plan.

5000|$|<b>Cash</b> <b>balance</b> {{conversions}} {{have been}} controversial and {{have raised the}} ire of workers and their advocates. In 2005 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report analyzing the effects of <b>cash</b> <b>balance</b> conversions on worker benefits. They found that in a typical conversion the <b>cash</b> <b>balance</b> plan would provide lower benefits for most workers than if the defined-benefit plan had remained unchanged and the worker had stayed in their job until retirement age. This decline in benefits tends to be largest for older workers. This is because in a traditional plan, where benefits are based on final average pay, the [...] "value" [...] of the benefits accrues much faster for older workers than for younger workers. In contrast, in a DC or <b>cash</b> <b>balance</b> plan, contributions are made {{at the same rate}} (by workers in the DC plans and by the employer in the <b>cash</b> <b>balance</b> plan), and a dollar contributed to a younger worker's account is actually more valuable because it has more time to compound before retirement. Thus some argue that <b>cash</b> <b>balance</b> plans hurt older workers.|$|R
