The other roles of PAI-1 include, <b>cell</b> <b>de-adhesion,</b> cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell signaling. These roles could suggest that PAI-1 expression in the tumor microenvironment enhances tumor cell progression. Urokinase cleaves the zymogen plasminogen into serine protease plasmin. The elevated levels of uPA is an indicator of cancer which {{could be found in}} the carcinoma of the breast. Plasmin can activate matrix metalloproteases (MMP's) in the extracellular matrix (ECM). MMP activation contributes to tumor cell invasion and metastasis by degradation of ECM components.|$|E
5000|$|Synthetic {{morphology}} extends {{this idea}} by adding output modules that alter the shape or social behaviour of cells {{in response to}} the state of the artificial gene network. For example, instead of just making a fluorescent protein, a gene network may switch on an adhesion molecule so that cells stick to each other, or activate a motility system so that cells move. It has been argued that the formation of properly-shaped tissues by mammalian cells involves mainly a set of about ten basic cellular events (cell proliferation, cell death, cell adhesion, differential adhesion, <b>cell</b> <b>de-adhesion,</b> cell fusion, cell locomotion, chemotaxis, haptotaxis, cell wedging). Broadly similar lists exist for tissues of plants, fungi etc. In principle, therefore, a fairly small set of output modules might allow biotechnologists to 'program' cells to produce artificially-designed arrangements, shapes and eventually 'tissues'.|$|E

This report describes aberrant {{expression of}} these genes in ovarian cancer, the commonest cause of death amongst gynaecological malignancies.

40|$|During inflammation, {{myeloperoxidase}} (MPO) {{released by}} circulating leukocytes accumulates within the subendothelial matrix by binding to and transcytosing the endothelium. Oxidative reactions catalyzed by subendothelial-localized MPO are implicated {{as a key}} cause of endothelial dysfunction in inflammatory vascular diseases. Whilst the subendothelial matrix is a reactive target for MPO-derived oxidants in disease, the functional implications of oxidative matrix modification for the endothelium are largely unknown. Here we show that hypochlorous acid (HOCl) produced by endothelial-transcytosed MPO oxidizes the subendothelial matrix, involving covalent crosslinking of the adhesive matrix protein fibronectin. Real-time biosensor and live cell imaging studies showed that HOCl-mediated matrix oxidation triggers rapid membrane retraction from the substratum and adjacent <b>cells</b> (<b>de-adhesion).</b> This de-adhesion was linked with the alteration of Tyr- 118 phosphorylation of paxillin, a key focal adhesion-dependent signaling process, as well as Rho kinase-dependent myosin light chain- 2 phosphorylation. De-adhesion dynamics were dependent on the contractile state of cells, with myosin II inhibition with blebbistatin markedly attenuating the rate of membrane retraction. Rho kinase inhibition with Y- 27632 also conferred protection, but not during the initial phase of membrane retraction, which was driven by pre-existing actomyosin tensile stress. Notably, diversion of MPO from HOCl production by thiocyanate and nitrite attenuated de-adhesion and associated signaling responses, despite the latter substrate supporting MPO-catalyzed fibronectin nitration.

40|$|Physical {{properties}} of the extracellular matrix (ECM) are known to regulate cellular processes ranging from spreading to differentiation, with alterations in cell phenotype closely associated with changes in physical {{properties of}} cells themselves. When plated on substrates of varying stiffness, fibroblasts {{have been shown to}} exhibit stiffness matching property, wherein cell cortical stiffness increases in proportion to substrate stiffness up to 5 kPa, and subsequently saturates. Similar mechanoadaptation responses have also been observed in other <b>cell</b> types. Trypsin <b>de-adhesion</b> represents a simple experimental framework for probing the contractile mechanics of adherent <b>cells,</b> with <b>de-adhesion</b> timescales shown to scale inversely with cortical stiffness values. In this study, we combine experiments and computation in deciphering the influence of substrate properties in regulating de-adhesion dynamics of adherent cells. We first show that NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts cultured on collagen-coated polyacrylamide hydrogels de-adhere faster on stiffer substrates. Using a simple computational model, we qualitatively show how substrate stiffness and cell-substrate bond breakage rate collectively influence de-adhesion timescales, and also obtain analytical expressions of de-adhesion timescales in certain regimes of the parameter space. Finally, by comparing stiffness-dependent experimental and computational de-adhesion responses, we show that faster de-adhesion on stiffer substrates arises due to force-dependent breakage of cell-matrix adhesions. In addition to illustrating the utility of employing trypsin de-adhesion as a biophysical tool for probing mechanoadaptation, our computational results highlight the collective interplay of substrate properties and bond breakage rate in setting de-adhesion timescales...|$|R

Evaluating drug effects on such responses becomes critical {{to the development of}} new cancer therapeutics. In this report, we have employed a label-free acoustic sensor, the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), to track the EGF-induced response of mutant MCF 10 A cells under various inhibitory conditions. We have identified a complex <b>cell</b> <b>de-adhesion</b> process, which can be distinctly altered by inhibitors of signaling pathways and cytoskeleton formation in a dose-dependent manner. The dose dependencies of the inhibitors provide IC 50 values which are in strong agreement with the values reported in the literature, demonstrating the sensitivity and reliability of the QCM-D as a screening tool. Using immunofluorescence imaging, we have also verified the quantitative relationship between the &# 916;D-response (change in energy dissipation factor) and the level of focal adhesions quantified with the areal density of immunostained vinculin under those inhibitory conditions. Such a correlation suggests that the dynamic restructuring of focal adhesions can be assessed based on the time-dependent change in &# 916;D-response. Overall, this report has shown that the QCM-D has the potential to become an effective sensing platform for screening therapeutic agents that target signaling and cytoskeletal proteins...|$|E
40|$|Background: Increased {{expression}} of Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin ligands has {{been implicated in}} tumor progression {{in a number of}} malignancies. This report describes aberrant {{expression of}} these genes in ovarian cancer, the commonest cause of death amongst gynaecological malignancies. Methods: Eph and ephrin expression was determined using quantitative real time RT-PCR. Correlation of gene expression was measured using Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s rho statistic. Survival was analysed using log-rank analysis and (was visualised by) Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Results: Greater than 10 fold over-expression of EphA 1 and a more modest over-expression of EphA 2 were observed in partially overlapping subsets of tumors. Over-expression of EphA 1 strongly correlated (r = 0. 801; p < 0. 01) with the high affinity ligand ephrin A 1. A similar trend was observed between EphA 2 and ephrin A 1 (r = 0. 387; p = 0. 06). A striking correlation of both ephrin A 1 and ephrin A 5 expression with poor survival (r = - 0. 470; p = 0. 02 and r = - 0. 562; p < 0. 01) was observed. Intriguingly, there was no correlation between survival and other clinical parameters or Eph expression.

40|$|Calpain {{activity}} {{is required for}} de-adhesion of the cell body and rear to enable productive locomotion of adherent cells during wound repair and tumor invasion. Growth factors activate m-calpain (calpain 2, CAPN 2) via ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinases, but only when these kinases are localized to the plasma membrane. We thus hypothesized that m-calpain is activated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) only when it is juxtaposed to the plasma membrane secondary to specific docking. Osmotic disruption of NR 6 fibroblasts expressing the EGF receptor demonstrated m-calpain being complexed with the substratum-adherent membrane with this increasing in an EGF-dependent manner. m-Calpain colocalized with phosphoinositide biphosphate (PIP 2) with exogenous phospholipase C removal of phosphoinositides, specifically, PI(4, 5) P 2 but not PI(4) P 1 or PIP 3, releasing the bound m-calpain. Downregulation of phosphoinositide production by 1 -butanol resulted in diminished PIP 2 in the plasma membrane and eliminated EGF-induced calpain activation. This PIP 2 -binding capacity resided in domain III of calpain, which presents a putative C 2 -like domain. This active conformation of this domain appears to be partially masked in the holoenzyme as both activation of m-calpain by phosphorylation at serine 50 and expression of constitutively active phosphorylation mimic glutamic acid-increased m-calpain binding to the membrane, consistent with blockade of this cascade diminishing membrane association. Importantly, we found that m-calpain was enriched toward the rear of locomoting cells, which was more pronounced in the plasma membrane footprints; EGF further enhanced this enrichment, in line with earlier reports of loss of PIP 2 in lamellipodia of motile cells. These data support a model of m-calpain binding to PIP 2 concurrent with and likely to enable ERK activation and provides a mechanism by which <b>cell</b> <b>de-adhesion</b> is directed to the cell body and tail as phospholipase C-γ hydrolyzes PIP 2 in the protruding lamellipodia...|$|E

40|$|CD 2 is a plasma {{membrane}} glycoprotein present on T lymphocytes that {{functions as a}} cell adhesion molecule (CAM). The CD 2 counter-receptor in rodents is the structurally-related CAM CD 48. Intercellular adhesion involves the formation of multiple CAM complexes between adhering <b>cells</b> and <b>de-adhesion</b> requires disruption of these complexes. To gain an insight into the initiation and termination of intercellular adhesion, the kinetics and affinity of the rat CD 2 -CD 48 interaction was analysed using a BIAcore instrument, which enables the monitoring of protein binding in real time. A soluble chimeric protein, comprising the extracellular portion of rat CD 48 and domains 3 and 4 of rat CD 4 (sCD 48 -CD 4), bound to immobilized soluble CD 2 (sCD 2) with a KD of 90 microM. The affinity was also determined in the reverse orientation and sCD 2 was shown to bind immobilized sCD 48 -CD 4 with a comparable KD of 60 microM. sCD 48 -CD 4 bound to immobilized deglycosylated sCD 2 with a KD of 125 microM, indicating that glycosylation of sCD 2 has {{little effect on the}} affinity of the interaction. The low affinity was the result of an extremely rapid off-rate constant (K(off) > or = 6 s- 1), whereas the on-rate constant was unremarkable (K(on) > or = 10 (5) M- 1 s- 1). The kinetic analysis revealed that small amounts of multimeric aggregates of sCD 48 -CD 4 formed in concentrated preparations. Our experience suggests that even low concentrations (< 2 %) of these aggregates may be a cause of artifactually high affinity values when analysing low-affinity protein interactions. In conclusion, this study provides the first detailed analysis of the kinetics and affinity of monomeric CAM interactions and suggests that binding between CAMs may be weaker than anticipated...|$|R
40|$|Normal {{wound healing}} is a complex, highly {{regulated}} dynamic process that requires co-ordinate responses of both epidermal and dermal compartments. To accomplish {{the healing process}} several growth factors, chemokines, and matrix elements signal both cell proliferation and migration during the inflammatory and reparative phases and limit these responses during the remodeling phase. We {{have found that the}} Glu-Leu-Arg-negative CXC chemokines interferon γ inducible protein 10, monokine induced by interferon γ, and platelet factor 4, limit fibroblast responsiveness to growth factors, but the functioning of these factors in wound healing remains uncertain. We hypothesized that the keratinocyte-derived member of this Glu-Leu-Arg-negative CXC family, interferon γ inducible protein 9 (IP- 9) CXCL 11 (also known as I-TAC, β-R 1, and H- 174) signals to the dermal compartment to synchronize the re-epithelialization process. Interferon γ inducible protein 9 was produced after mechanical wounding of a keratinocyte monolayer, suggesting {{for the first time that}} this could be a wound response factor. Interferon γ inducible protein 9 limited epidermal growth factor (EGF) -induced fibroblast motility (57 ± 7 %) by the same protein kinase A (KA) -mediated inhibition of calpain activation and <b>cell</b> <b>de-adhesion</b> as described for interferon γ inducible protein 10. Surprisingly, interferon γ inducible protein 9 enhanced growth factor-induced motility in undifferentiated keratinocytes (137 ± 19 %) as determined in a two-dimensional in vitro wound healing assay, and interferon γ inducible protein 9 alone promoted motility in undifferentiated keratinocytes (49 ± 10 % of epidermal growth factor-induced motility). A stimulated keratinocyte/target cell coculture system revealed that interferon γ inducible protein 9 acts as a soluble keratinocyte-derived paracrine factor for both fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Further, we found that in both fibroblasts and undifferentiated keratinocytes, interferon γ inducible protein 9 exerted its action through modulation of a cytosolic protease, calpain. Interestingly, interferon γ inducible protein 9 increased calpain activity in undifferentiated keratinocytes, whereas the same chemokine inhibited the calpain activity in fibroblasts. This provides for a model whereby redifferentiated basal keratinocytes could limit fibroblast repopulation of the dermis underlying healed wounds while simultaneously promoting re-epithelialization of the remaining provisional wound...|$|E
40|$|Precise {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} regulation of <b>cell</b> adhesion and <b>de-adhesion</b> is critical for dynamic lymphocyte migration. Although {{a great deal of}} information has been learned about integrin lymphocyte function–associated antigen (LFA) - 1 adhesion, the mechanism that regulates efficient LFA- 1 de-adhesion from intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) - 1 during T lymphocyte migration is unknown. Here, we show that nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA (MyH 9) is recruited to LFA- 1 at the uropod of migrating T lymphocytes, and inhibition of the association of MyH 9 with LFA- 1 results in extreme uropod elongation, defective tail detachment, and decreased lymphocyte migration on ICAM- 1, without affecting LFA- 1 activation by chemokine CXCL- 12. This defect was reversed by a small molecule antagonist that inhibits both LFA- 1 affinity and avidity regulation, but not by an antagonist that inhibits only affinity regulation. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy of the contact zone between migrating T lymphocytes and ICAM- 1 substrate revealed that inactive LFA- 1 is selectively localized to the posterior of polarized T lymphocytes, whereas active LFA- 1 is localized to their anterior. Thus, during T lymphocyte migration, uropodal adhesion depends on LFA- 1 avidity, where MyH 9 serves as a key mechanical link between LFA- 1 and the cytoskeleton that is critical for LFA- 1 de-adhesion...|$|R
40|$|In {{mammalian}} testis, spermatogenesis {{takes place}} in the seminiferous epithelium of the seminiferous tubule, which is composed of a series of cellular events. These include: (i) spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) renewal via mitosis and differentiation of SSC to spermatogenia, (ii) meiosis, (iii) spermiogenesis, and (iv) spermiation. Throughout these events, developing germ cells remain adhered to the Sertoli cell in the seminiferous epithelium amidst extensive cellular, biochemical, molecular and morphological changes to obtain structural support and nourishment. These events are coordinated via signal transduction at the cell-cell interface through cell junctions, illustrating the significance of cell junctions and adhesion in spermatogenesis. Additionally, developing germ cells migrate progressively across the seminiferous epithelium from the stem cell niche, which is located in the basal compartment near the basement membrane of the tunica propria adjacent to the interstitium. Recent studies have shown that some apparently unrelated proteins, such as polarity proteins and actin regulatory proteins, are in fact working in concert and synergistically to coordinate the continuous cyclic changes of adhesion at the Sertoli- Sertoli and Sertoli-germ cell interface in the seminiferous epithelium during the epithelial cycle of spermatogenesis, such that developing germ cells remain attached to the Sertoli cell in the epithelium while they alter in cell shape and migrate across the epithelium. In this review, we highlight the physiological significance of endocytic vesicle-mediated protein trafficking events under the influence of polarity and actin regulatory proteins in conferring cyclic events of <b>cell</b> adhesion and <b>de-adhesion.</b> Furthermore, these recent findings have unraveled some unexpected molecules to be targeted for male contraceptive development, which are also targets of toxicant-induced male reproductive dysfunction. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Adhesion plaques from chicken embryonic fibroblasts or from cells transformed by Rous sarcoma virus contain {{low levels of}} tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (YPPs) which were {{below the level of}} detection in 0. 5 -microns thin, frozen sections. In contrast, intense localization of YPPs was observed at invadopodia of transformed cells at sites of degradation and invasion into the fibronectin-coated gelatin substratum, but not in membrane extensions free of contact with the extracellular matrix. Local extracellular matrix degradation and formation of invadopodia were blocked by genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine-specific kinases, but cells remained attached to the substratum and retained their free- membrane extensions. Invadopodia reduced or lost YPP labeling after treatment of the cells with genistein, but adhesion plaques retained YPP labeling. The plasma membrane contact fractions of normal and transformed cells have been isolated form cells grown on gelatin cross- linked substratum using a novel fractionation scheme, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Four major YPPs (150, 130, 81, and 77 kD) characterize invadopodial membranes in contact with the matrix, and are probably responsible for the intense YPP labeling associated with invadopodia extending into sites of matrix degradation. YPP 150 may be an invadopodal-specific YPP since it is approximately 3. 6 -fold enriched in the invasive contact fraction relative to the cell body fraction and is not observed in normal contacts. YPP 130 is enriched in transformed cell contacts but may also be present in normal contacts. The two major YPPs of normal contacts (130 and 71 kD) are much lower in abundance than the major tyrosine-phosphorylated bands associated with invadopodial membranes, and likely represent major adhesion plaque YPPs. YPP 150, paxillin, and tensin appear to be enriched in the cell contact fractions containing adhesion plaques and invadopodia relative to the cell body fraction, but are also present in the soluble supernate fraction. However, vinculin, talin, and alpha-actinin that are localized at invadopodia, are equally concentrated in cell bodies and cell contacts as is the membrane-adhesion receptor beta 1 integrin. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of the membrane-bound proteins may contribute to the cytoskeletal and plasma membrane events leading to the formation and function of invadopodia that contact and proteolytically degrade the extracellular matrix; we have identified several candidate YPPs that may participate in the regulation of these processes...|$|R
