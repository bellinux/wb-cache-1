40|$|Abstract — False data {{injection}} {{attacks are}} recently introduced {{as a class}} of cyber attacks against smart grid’s monitoring systems. They aim to compromise <b>the</b> readings <b>of</b> grid sensors and phasor measurement units. Recent {{studies have shown that}} if the operator uses the DC, i. e., linear, state estimation to determine <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power system, the attacker can adjust the attack vector such that the attack remains undetected and successfully passes the commonly used residue-based bad data detection tests. However, in this paper, we examine <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> implementing a false data injection attack when the operator uses the more practical AC, i. e., nonlinear, state estimation. We characterize such attacks when the attacker has perfect and imperfect knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system. To <b>the</b> best <b>of</b> our knowledge, this is the first paper to address false data injection attacks against non-linear state estimation...|$|R
5|$|Oberon may be {{differentiated}} into a rocky core {{surrounded by}} an icy mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (480km) is about 63% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 54% of the moon's mass—the proportions are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Oberon is about 0.5GPa (5kbar). The <b>current</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> icy mantle is unclear. If the ice contains enough ammonia or other antifreeze, Oberon may possess a liquid ocean layer at the core–mantle boundary. The thickness of this ocean, if it exists, is up to 40km and its temperature is around 180K. However, the internal structure of Oberon depends heavily on its thermal history, which is poorly known at present.|$|E
5|$|The <b>current</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{motor vehicle}} {{industry}} in Ohio is mixed and dotted. In 2002, the Ohio motor vehicle industry produced about $16 billion of items. This is about 14% {{of the automobile}} production of the United States, and Ohio outputs every state in production of motor vehicles except for Michigan. These $16 billion account for approximately 4.1% of Ohio's gross state product; however, the motor vehicle industry only accounts for 1.1% of the United States' output. In 2003, Ohio was able to produce about 1,885,000 motor vehicles, accounting for 15.6% of the United States' production, and, again, more than any state except for Michigan, in which 928,000 of these were automobiles.|$|E
