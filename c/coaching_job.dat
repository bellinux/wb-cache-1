5|$|After {{spending}} {{less than a}} year with the team, Groh resigned to accept a <b>coaching</b> <b>job</b> at his alma mater, the University of Virginia. Parcells resigned from his front-office position and was replaced with Chiefs executive Terry Bradway on Parcells' recommendation.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{spent two}} {{successful}} years at Severn. The team was undefeated {{in his first}} season and won the Maryland state championship. In 1931, the team's win-loss-tie record was 5–2–1. Brown's overall record was 12–2–1. After his second year, Massillon's head <b>coaching</b> <b>job</b> became available, and Brown took the position.|$|E
50|$|Cameron {{was interviewed}} {{for a number}} of head <b>coaching</b> <b>jobs,</b> {{including}} the Houston Texans and St. Louis Rams vacancies following the 2005 season but was not hired.

5|$|Beamer {{himself was}} {{the object of}} some off-field {{controversy}} when Georgia considered offering him its head football <b>coaching</b> <b>job</b> during the days prior to the Sugar Bowl. Beamer denied any interest in the position, and the controversy abated when Georgia hired Glen Mason as its head coach on December 18. Mason later changed his mind, and Georgia hired Jim Donnan instead.|$|E
5|$|Parseghian's {{candidacy}} {{for the head}} <b>coaching</b> <b>job</b> at Notre Dame was unusual {{because he was not}} a Notre Dame graduate, as every head coach since Knute Rockne had been. Parseghian was also an Armenian Presbyterian, making him the first non-Catholic coach since Rockne, who converted in 1925. Joyce made it clear before his hiring that he did not care about Parseghian's religion, but simply wanted someone who could lead the football team to success.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{outbreak}} of the war, Kathleen Verity began to suffer from poor health, and the family planned a trip to South Africa in the English winter of 1939 to aid her recovery and so Verity could take up one of several offers of a <b>coaching</b> <b>job.</b> In the last months before Hedley Verity went overseas during the war, Kathleen joined him in Omagh and later in London just before he went away.|$|E

5|$|At Great Lakes, Collier went {{regularly}} {{to observe the}} practices of the station's service football team, the Great Lakes Bluejackets. There he met Paul Brown, who had left a head <b>coaching</b> <b>job</b> at Ohio State University {{to serve in the}} Navy and lead the Bluejackets team. Collier took notes and hoped to pick up some football knowledge he could use when he returned to Paris. Brown, however, noticed Collier's dedication and brought him onto his staff as a volunteer assistant.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1958 season, O'Connell, who {{lacked the}} stature and {{durability}} Paul Brown wanted in a starter, retired {{to take a}} <b>coaching</b> <b>job</b> in Illinois, and Milt Plum was named as his replacement. Cleveland, however, was relying increasingly on the running game, in contrast to its pass-happy early years under Graham. As the team built up a 9–3 regular-season record, Brown in 1958 ran for 1,527yards – almost {{twice as much as}} any other back and a league record at the time.|$|E
50|$|In January 2012, Hašek {{took over}} the head <b>coach</b> <b>job</b> at Riyadh-based team Al-Hilal FC, {{replacing}} Thomas Doll.|$|R

5|$|Entering the 2011–12 NCAA Division I men's {{basketball}} season head coach Mitch Henderson began his tenure at Princeton, taking over for Sydney Johnson. With the move {{that resulted from}} Johnson taking a new <b>coaching</b> <b>job,</b> Princeton has six alumni who are active Division I head coaches, a total second only to eight by the North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball program. The Ivy League media poll selected Princeton to be tied with Yale for second place behind Harvard. Princeton had been the preseason favorite the year before.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, he {{returned}} to Vanderbilt as {{head coach of the}} basketball team and assistant football coach. In his second stint as Vanderbilt's basketball coach, Cody went 51–50. In 1934, when McGugin retired, Cody was passed over for the head <b>coaching</b> <b>job</b> in favor of former Vanderbilt quarterback and SMU coach Ray Morrison. Morrison brought his own staff from SMU and neglected Cody's coaching abilities, but Cody remained basketball coach through the 1935–1936 season. His Commodores basketball teams tallied 51–50 in five seasons.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Shaughnessy {{was rumored}} as a {{candidate}} for the vacant Washington Redskins head <b>coaching</b> <b>job,</b> but nothing came of it. From 1951 to 1962, Shaughnessy served {{on the staff of the}} Chicago Bears as a technical advisor, vice president, and defensive specialist. Halas retained responsibility for the offense, including the Bears' T formation. Ironically, Shaughnessy was tasked with developing a defense to counter the T formation. One of his solutions was the 5–3–3 defense, which left outside linebackers available to defend against end runs and passes in the flat.|$|E
50|$|He later {{admitted}} joining Celta {{in such circumstances}} was a mistake and vowed never to accept <b>coaching</b> <b>jobs</b> in mid-season again.|$|R

5|$|Jones {{stayed with}} the Browns until early 1968, when he quit and was {{replaced}} by Nick Skorich. The Browns had offered him a part-time <b>coaching</b> <b>job</b> but made clear that he could not stay on as offensive coordinator; Jones declined the reduced role. After leaving the Browns, Jones moved back to Ruston and did occasional scouting for the team at the nearby Grambling State University. He was also a volunteer coach of receivers on Grambling's football team. Later in life, he worked for his son Tom's general contracting business in Ruston.|$|E
5|$|Ron Everhart {{returned}} for his fourth season as head coach. After {{the departure of}} previous coach Danny Nee, Everhart steadily improved the team's record year after year, taking the team from 3–24 the year before he arrived to the 21–13 record of 2008–09. Everhart attended Virginia Tech, from which he graduated in 1985. He served {{as an assistant coach}} at Georgia Tech, Virginia Military Institute, and Tulane University. In 1995, he took his first head <b>coaching</b> <b>job</b> at McNeese State University, and also coached at Northeastern University before moving to Duquesne in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Skip Holtz {{grew up in}} many towns {{while his}} father coached football. After Skip was born in Connecticut, the Holtz family moved to Columbia, South Carolina for two years, as his father worked as an {{assistant}} coach at the University of South Carolina. In 1968, the family moved to Columbus, Ohio after Holtz took a job at Ohio State University. One year later, the Holtz family moved to Williamsburg, Virginia and The College of William & Mary for Lou's first head coaching position. After two seasons, Lou took a head coaching position with the Wolfpack of North Carolina State University. The family lived in Raleigh, North Carolina for four years until Lou accepted a head <b>coaching</b> <b>job</b> for the National Football League's New York Jets. The family lived in Cold Spring Harbor, New York for one year, while Lou coached the Jets. After resigning from the Jets, Lou took his family back to the American South when he accepted the head <b>coaching</b> <b>job</b> in Fayetteville, Arkansas, at the University of Arkansas in 1977. In Fayetteville, Skip attended Fayetteville High School and graduated in 1982.|$|E

50|$|After leaving Brisbane Road, Sitton battled {{depression}} and had therapy. He was {{passed over for}} many club <b>coaching</b> <b>jobs</b> and his application for a youth coach position at Charlton Athletic was rejected due to how he was perceived in Club for a Fiver, leaving him very disillusioned with football. He spent eighteen months applying for <b>coaching</b> <b>jobs</b> without success despite being an otherwise well regarded coach within football due to his earlier coaching work at Lilleshall and with the Leyton Orient youth team.|$|R
5|$|The Browns {{also made}} a number of changes to the {{coaching}} staff before the season. Bob Voigts, the tackles coach in 1946, left to become head football coach at Northwestern University. Bill Edwards, a former schoolmate of Brown's at Massillon, was hired to replace him. Red Conkright, the end and center coach in 1946, left for an assistant <b>coaching</b> <b>job</b> with the Buffalo Bills; he was replaced by Dick Gallagher. Creighton Miller, meanwhile, who had served as a backfield coach, left the Browns staff to get a law degree.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, the United States Naval Academy {{hired him}} to coach their football team. He led the squad to a 4–1–2 record for the season, including a 1–1–1 record against rival schools. He then accepted a <b>coaching</b> <b>job</b> at Dartmouth College, where {{for the next four}} years he led them to perfect records against both of their Triangular Football League opponents. They had a winning record the first year and a 5–2–1 record the second year. In 1899, his fifth season as coach, his team went 2–7 and lost both of its conference games.|$|E
5|$|Bill Perigo {{took over}} the Michigan <b>coaching</b> <b>job</b> after having served three seasons as Western Michigan {{basketball}} coach. Despite previous success as a conference basketball champion coach at Western and subsequent success as a Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) champion basketball coach, his Michigan teams endured several mediocre seasons. His best Big Ten records came in 1956–57 and 1958–59 when his teams compiled 8–6 conference records. The latter team was tied for second in the conference and was 15–7 overall (8–6, Big Ten). It also had Perigo's only first-team All-Big Ten athlete in M. C. Burton. Team captain and two-time football consensus All-American Ron Kramer was third-team All-Big Ten in 1957 after being second-team All-Big Ten in both 1955 and 1956.|$|E
