The sewers were designed to {{be large enough to}} evacuate rain water immediately; the large amount of water used to wash the city streets; waste water from both industries and individual households; and water that collected in basements when the level of the Seine was high. Before Haussmann, the sewer tunnels (featured in Victor Hugo's Les Miserables) were cramped and narrow, just 1.8 meters high and 75 to 80 centimeters wide. The new tunnels were 2.3 meters high and 1.3 meters wide, large enough for men to work standing up. These flowed into larger tunnels that carried the waste water to even larger collector tunnels, which were 4.4 meters high and 5.6 meters wide. A channel {{down the center of the}} tunnel carried away the waste water, with sidewalks on either side for the égoutiers, or sewer workers. Specially designed wagons and boats moved on rails up and down the <b>channels,</b> <b>cleaning</b> them.

40|$|Population {{growth and}} rapid {{development}} have caused changes {{of land use}} arrangement. This phenomenon also occurs in the Syahdan campus area, Bina Nusantara University. Impacts of these changes were the increasing of direct surface flow, so that the rain which came down in a short duration could cause puddles at Syahdan campus. Article explores the effectiveness of rain water management system at Campus Syahdan, Bina Nusantara University; which was studied based on rainfall records to obtain rain intensity for various frequent periods. The field survey was conducted to detect the condition of existing drainage at Campus Syahdan, Bina Nusantara University; including drainage scheme, channel dimension, capturing area, and existing condition of the existing channel. From the analysis, {{it can be concluded}} that the channel capacity of rain water was still able to retain the rain water discharge.

40|$|Salinity {{control is}} a major {{component}} of water management in arid climates and irrigated areas and one of particular concern in the Colorado River Basin. The alts enter the water as it flows over land or moves through the soil or geologic formations. The principal salt collection processes are 1) dissolution from the soil surface during runoff events, 2) transpiration of soil water leaving salt residuals, 3) efflorescence left by evaporating seepage and then dissolved by subsequent runoff, 4) dissolution with weathering of fixed bed channels, 5) salts released by sediments entering the channel from sheet, gulley, and bank erosion, and 6) deep percolation through saline aquifer reaching the stream as base flow. This study examined processes 3 and 5. Salt efflorescence was examined by field observation and instrumentation, laboratory experiments, and mathematical modeling. The field data showed near saturation conditions of sodium sulfate waters below crusts of densities between 0. 14 and 0. 36 g/cm^ 2 and which formed over abouta 10 -day period following <b>channel</b> <b>cleaning</b> by storm runoff. Laboratory data on salt crusting in soil columns were also used in developing a model which when applied to the Price River Basin estimated that no more than 7. 5 percent of the total salt loading comes from salt efflorescence being carried away in the stream flow. The conditions favorable to the accumulation of salt efflorescence are highly saline water just below the soil surface and a source of heat for vaporizing the water. Salt release from suspended sediments was studied by laboratory experimentation with sediment material obtained from various locations in the Price River Basin. The Buckinham Pi Theorem was employed to derive relationships expressing the EC of a sediment water system as a function o fthe controlling factors. The results were presented in two salt release equations, one excluding the effect of initial EC and the other providing for initially saline solutions. The salt release equations were incorporated into an adapted version of the Watershed Erosion and Sediment Transport (WEST) model and applied to a small tributary of Coal Creek. Extrapolation to the entire Price River Basin led to an estimate that about 0. 50 percent of the total annual salt load is released from suspened sediments. This study concludes that surface salt sources produce a relatvely small fraction of the total loading. Future studies need to go underground. They need to quantify and examine the flow lines of water movement from mountain source and valley floow recharge areas to points of emergence as base flow in the larger stream channels. They need to investigate the aquifers and their soluble salt content...|$|E

40|$|In {{this report}} {{we discuss the}} impact of {{polarized}} foregrounds on a future CMBPol satellite mission. We review our current knowledge of Galactic polarized emission at microwave frequencies, including synchrotron and thermal dust emission. We use existing data and {{our understanding of the}} physical behavior of the sources of foreground emission to generate sky templates, and start to assess how well primordial gravitational wave signals can be separated from foreground contaminants for a CMBPol mission. At the estimated foreground minimum of ~ 100 GHz, the polarized foregrounds are expected to be lower than a primordial polarization signal with tensor-to-scalar ratio r= 0. 01, in a small patch (~ 1 %) of the sky known to have low Galactic emission. Over 75 % of the sky we expect the foreground amplitude to exceed the primordial signal by about a factor of eight at the foreground minimum and on scales of two degrees. Only on the largest scales does the polarized foreground amplitude exceed the primordial signal by a larger factor of about 20. The prospects for detecting an r= 0. 01 signal including degree-scale measurements appear promising, with 5 sigma_r ~ 0. 003 forecast from multiple methods. A mission that observes a range of scales offers better prospects from the foregrounds perspective than one targeting only the lowest few multipoles. We begin to explore how optimizing the composition of frequency channels in the focal plane can maximize our ability to perform component separation, with a range of typically 40 < nu < 300 GHz preferred for ten <b>channels.</b> Foreground <b>cleaning</b> methods are already in place to tackle a CMBPol mission data set, and further investigation of the optimization and detectability of the primordial signal will be useful for mission design.

João ordered an inspection on the hydraulic works made on the Lis River. This inspection resulted in a new project proposal by sergeant major Manuel Caetano de Sousa, who contested the hydraulic project of Reinaldo Oudinot. These actions cause Oudinot to be removed {{from the direction of the}} harbour.Although the presence of Reinaldo Oudinot was no longer required in Leiria, a short time later he was assigned to work on Porto, to open and clean the harbour of Douro River.

40|$|The arid {{climate of}} the High Algerian Plateaux {{constitutes}} a limiting factor {{to the development of}} wild endangered Cuvier’s Gazelle (Gazella cuvieri) registered in IUCN’s red list. This antelope can utilize water from plants as well as dew, but it needs to visit waterholes frequently. In this semi-desert region, the classified nature reserve of Mergueb located in the M’sila Wilaya (Algeria) is the predilection area for Cuvier’s Gazelle. It is located south of Algiers in the main high steppes of Hodna and covers an area of about 16 482 hectares. It faces however the critical problem of water scarcity and surface water storage, vital for the survival of the gazelle. Precipitation in this arid region, with an annual average around 260 mm, is characterized by a large variability, with a sporadic and torrential distribution. Maximum monthly values are observed in May and from October to December. Months from June to September suffer important water deficit. The study undertaken in 2002 by the General Direction of Forestry (DGF) within the framework of G 35 UNDP-DGF project led to the selection of sites to mobilize and store surface water for wild mammals to ensure water availability during periods of shortage. An integrated management scheme has been proposed, using simple techniques and local building materials at a minimum cost. It is represented by the ‘Djobs traditional water storage system’ which description constitutes the core of the present paper. The choice of djobs as water storage system is based on: (1) simple building techniques adapted to the local materials; (2) a topography with very small watershed, where the runoff can be gathered and stored. Djob can be defined as a large shallow hole in the soil, or a small pond, that will store enough runoff water and will allow gazelles to easily use it without being scared. Favorable runoff catchment area for djob’s construction, should: (1) be clean, smooth, non-erosive and have small slope to slow down the runoff; (2) not require heavy equipment disturbing the environment; (3) provide local building materials and at a minimum cost; (4) be easy to clean and to restore; (5) allow the wild species to approach. Selected sites are characterized by: (1) their position across small shallow and very narrow thalwegs, thus requiring only an embankment to be built with local rocks and soil gathered from the stream channel bottom; (2) impermeable reservoir bottom and side wall reducing water loss; (3) limited dike height which is function of the amount of water to be mobilized and which should reduce surface water plan to limit evaporation. With this storing method, drinking water is available for a long period and the construction is easy to realize and does not disturb the environment, thus allowing wild livestock to settle. Because of the extreme intensity of the storms that may occur in the region, the dike resistance should be increased: (1) by curing the stream <b>channel</b> bottom and <b>cleaning</b> the banks (thalweg preparation); (2) by compacting the talus and its vegetation. Autumn rainfall is responsible for alluvial deposits in the djobs. Silt deposits inside these reservoirs are inevitable in these arid lands. However, the choice of the sites should minimize this effect; catchment area less than 63 000 m 2 with geological formations hard to erode should be favoured. In conclusion, djobs are the solution for helping developing and protecting Cuvier’s Gazelle. Their construction is simple to perform at a minimum cost. However, they should periodically be cleaned, controlled and fixedL'aridité du climat des Hauts Plateaux algériens constitue un facteur limitant pour l'émancipation de la faune sauvage et particulièrement pour les espèces protégées. La réserve de Mergueb (M'sila) localisée dans ces hautes plaines steppiques représente une zone où la réhabilitation des eaux de surface est indispensable pour la sédentarisation et le développement des troupeaux de la Gazelle de Cuvier (Gazella cuvieri) espèce emblématique de la région, inscrite sur la liste rouge de l'IUCN. Suite à l'étude initiée en 2002 par la Direction Générale des Forêts dans le cadre du projet G 35 PNUD-DGF pour l'élaboration du plan de gestion de la réserve, il a été détecté un manque critique de points d'eau pour ce mammifère. En tenant compte des potentialités hydriques très faibles de la région (pluie moyenne annuelle autour de 260 mm, répartie sur seulement 77 jours avec un maximum en mai et entre octobre et décembre), ainsi que des différentes formes d'érosion des versants, de la technicité locale et des moyens financiers modestes, il est proposé la capture des eaux de ruissellement par le système de Djobs, ouvrages traditionnels parfaitement intégrés au paysage et édifiés avec des matériaux locaux.
