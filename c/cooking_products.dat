40|$|Cooking oil is an {{important}} product in the Malaysia food industries. Most of the <b>cooking</b> oil <b>products</b> is based on palm oil. However, there are activities in selling cheaper cooking oil by labelling as high quality in <b>cooking</b> oil <b>product.</b> Traditional methods {{have been developed to}} measure the quality of the <b>cooking</b> oil <b>product</b> such as the chromatography technique but the cost for the system setup is expensive and requires a large amount of time to analyse the sample. Thus, a suitable and reliable system with less analysis time is needed for widespread industrial uses. This paper has presented a discriminative technique for palm cooking oil using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) with planar electromagnetic sensor array. The sensor consists of a meander sensor and an interdigital sensors which interact with the test samples. Three types of palm cooking oil such as double refined palm oil, refined and deodorized palm oil with peanut and sesame oil, and filtered palm oil were prepared. The results obtained showed that the presented technique was able to differentiate the samples between 20 kHz to 1 Mhz. The results obtained correlate with the theories on EIS technique and planar electromagnetic sensor which are presented in this paper...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} examines perceived risk at the facet level (Psychological, Social, Performance, Safety, Health and Financial) and {{assesses the}} influence of consumer experience and perception of self (perceived ability, interest in product and interest in <b>cooking),</b> <b>product</b> (perceived product consistency), and environment (perceived confidence in the independent butcher) on these facets. It can be concluded that {{the influence of}} experience and perceptions varies by facet. However, perceived ability, confidence in the independent butcher and interest in beef were significant determinants of perceived risk for most risk facets while cooking interest, perceived consistency and experience were more risk facet specific. In the second section of this paper the use of risk relievers is considered. It is clear that consumer experience and perceptions also influence the level of use of risk relievers, for example those with more experience, who believe beef is consistent and are confident {{in their ability to}} select beef tend to use location more than others. It was concluded that the person's views of themselves, of the product and of the purchase environment have a direct effect on their information search activity even for a relatively low involvement product.
