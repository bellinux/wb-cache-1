5|$|A fierce sky {{caught in}} the {{dichotomy}} between the setting sun and the crescent moon dominates {{more than a third}} of the painting. The rain-heavy clouds swirling ominously around each celestial entity are separated by a gulf of calmness, intensifying the contrast and infusing the heavens with an unearthly glow. Light from the sky spills onto the landscape: while the western continent and the Nile are bathed in the sun's light, the east and the Tower of Babel are <b>cloaked</b> <b>in</b> shadow.|$|E
5|$|The Société des Gens des Lettres, a Parisian {{organization}} of writers, planned {{a monument to}} French novelist Honoré de Balzac immediately {{after his death in}} 1850. The society commissioned Rodin to create the memorial in 1891, and Rodin spent years developing the concept for his sculpture. Challenged in finding an appropriate representation of Balzac given the author's rotund physique, Rodin produced many studies: portraits, full-length figures in the nude, wearing a frock coat, or in a robe– a replica of which Rodin had requested. The realized sculpture displays Balzac <b>cloaked</b> <b>in</b> the drapery, looking forcefully into the distance with deeply gouged features. Rodin's intent had been to show Balzac at the moment of conceiving a work– to express courage, labor, and struggle.|$|E
5|$|Devil Daggers is {{a shooter}} video game with {{gameplay}} experienced from a first-person perspective. The {{goal of the}} game is to kill demonic enemies and survive for as long as possible. Devil Daggers opens with the player character standing in a shadowy room; in front of them is a floating dagger illuminated by a spotlight. Upon retrieving the dagger, the player is transported to a flat, floating platform arena <b>cloaked</b> <b>in</b> darkness. In the arena, demonic enemies begin spawning. Initially, a series of tentacled, towering creatures spawn and start releasing swarms of flying skulls that pursue the player. As time progresses, more exotic creatures that pose a greater threat and exhibit different behaviour begin to appear. Each enemy makes a unique and continuous noise, so that the player is able to recognise what type of enemy is approaching them.|$|E

5|$|The Voyage Home was {{the first}} Star Trek film to {{extensively}} film on location—only one day was spent doing so in The Search for Spock. Much of the production was filmed in and around San Francisco during ten days of shooting. The production wanted to film scenes that were readily identifiable as the city. The use of extensive location shooting caused logistical problems; {{a scene in which}} Kirk is nearly run over by an irate cab driver required 12–15cars to be repositioned if the shot was incorrect, taking a half-hour to reshoot. Other scenes were filmed in the city but used sets rather than real locations, such as an Italian restaurant where Taylor and Kirk eat. In the film, the Bird-of-Prey lands <b>cloaked</b> <b>in</b> Golden Gate Park, surprising trashmen who flee the scene in their truck. The production had planned to film in the real park, where they had filmed scenes for The Wrath of Khan, but heavy rains before the day of shooting prevented it—the garbage truck would have become bogged down in the mud. Will Rogers Park in western Los Angeles was used instead.|$|E
25|$|The {{veteran of}} bombing at Morobe Bay and the kamikaze in San Pedro Bay, however, proved tougher. The communists {{salvaged}} her, refitted her, and renamed her Taku San.

25|$|The plot of Purge {{focuses on}} two main females, {{both of whom}} reviewers have commented on as complex and are {{integral}} to understanding the themes of the book. The novel begins with Aliide Truu, an elderly woman who has survived many of {{the horrors of the}} Soviet occupation of Estonia. The Aliide who the reader first meets has alienated herself from the local people, though strongly self-reliant. Though <b>cloaked</b> <b>in</b> a rough exterior, she represents a woman who has weathered considerable hardship. She has hardly anything in the way of motherly instinct, especially in regards to the other main character, Zara.|$|E

25|$|Visual {{interventions}} {{within the}} buildings allow constant interaction between patrons {{and the outer}} environment. From floor to ceiling expansive windows in the pool area to the spiraling staircase with windows opening into the park, the building offers patrons different perspectives of environment outside. Regardless of the season, athletes can enjoy physical recreation and the outdoor environment. The building’s main façade is <b>cloaked</b> <b>in</b> a single concrete matrix of different aggregates used to form the mixture of surfaces within each section. Tucked between the concrete matrix are multicolored glass tiles reminiscent of the glimmering colors of water. These apertures, which are sprinkled along the building’s façade, cast varying shadows on the interior.|$|E
25|$|The {{ending of}} the novel, with Admiral Bertie sailing in and taking credit, in that way matches the {{historical}} event, as he led the squadron in December 1810. Some view that defeat as the most serious to the Royal Navy in the Napoleonic Wars; the interim defeat and very real loss of ships were <b>cloaked</b> <b>in</b> victory, as the islands were taken. The French mark their victory on the Arc de Triomphe, the only naval action noted there. Though Aubrey expects no baronetcy for his accomplishments in the novel, in history, both Admiral Bertie and Commodore Rowley received a baronetcy in recognition of their success in a popular military campaign.|$|E
25|$|În preajma revoluției first {{appeared}} in eight volumes between 1932 and 1936, when it met with popular and critical success, although this was {{largely due to the}} fact that its author was <b>cloaked</b> <b>in</b> legend. The Communist regime banned the work for its duration, considering it unpublishable, even after Ceaușescu steered a course away from Soviet tutelage. The book was published between 1990 and 1991 at Chișinău, while Stere's biographer Zigu Ornea put out another edition in 1991-1993. Both editions of the somewhat problematic 2331-page text were flawed, and in 2010, the Iași-based literary historian Victor Durnea began publishing a critical, annotated edition of Stere's works, starting with the novel. The manuscripts no longer exist, Stere's archive in his country house at Bucov having mysteriously disappeared after World War II, so that Durnea's interventions were limited to introducing uniformity into the available text, eliminating arbitrary decisions both by Stere and his editors, and replacing obsolete terms and punctuation that resulted from the author's culturally Russian outlook.|$|E
40|$|Despite much {{interest}} and progress <b>in</b> optical spatial <b>cloaking,</b> a three-dimensional (3 D), transmitting, continuously multidirectional <b>cloak</b> <b>in</b> the visible regime {{has not yet}} been demonstrated. Here we experimentally demonstrate such a cloak using ray optics, albeit with some edge effects. Our device requires no new materials, uses isotropic off-the-shelf optics, scales easily to cloak arbitrarily large objects, and is as broadband as the choice of optical material, all of which have been challenges for current <b>cloaking</b> schemes. <b>In</b> addition, we provide a concise formalism that quantifies and produces perfect optical <b>cloaks</b> <b>in</b> the small-angle (`paraxial') limit...|$|R

500|$|The homoerotic {{overtones of}} Barton's {{relationship}} with Charlie are not unintentional. Although one detective demands {{to know if}} they had [...] "some sick sex thing", their intimacy is presented as anything but deviant, and <b>cloaked</b> <b>in</b> conventions of mainstream sexuality. Charlie's first friendly overture toward his neighbor, for example, {{comes in the form of}} a standard pick-up line: [...] "I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink". The wrestling scene between Barton and Charlie is also cited as an example of homoerotic affection. [...] "We consider that a sex scene", Joel Coen said in 2001.|$|E
500|$|The {{botanist}} Sandra Knapp {{writes that}} [...] "Buffon's prose was so purple that the ideas themselves are almost hidden", observing {{that this was}} also the contemporary academic opinion. She notes that some quite radical ideas {{are to be found in}} his work, but they are almost invisible, given the language they are <b>cloaked</b> <b>in.</b> She quotes Buffon's dramatic description of the lion, which along with the engraving in her view [...] "emphasized both the lion's regal bearing and personality not only in his text but also in the illustration... A reader was left in no doubt as to the importance and character of the animal." [...] She concludes [...] "No wonder the cultured aristocratic public lapped it up – the text reads more like a romantic novel than a dry scientific treatise".|$|E

500|$|D'Angelo's singing {{throughout}} Brown Sugar is a gospel-influenced, falsetto crooning style, which {{critics have}} compared {{the singing of}} Prince, Al Green, Donny Hathaway, and Sam Cooke. Despite the album's retro influence, music writers have noted his delivery as having a hip hop approach and [...] "", as one critic described the album as a [...] "blend of classic soul and urban attitude". Another writer described the album's vibe as [...] "sultry" [...] and D'Angelo's vocal delivery as [...] "sly". Music journalist Jon Caramanica later called D'Angelo a [...] "classicist, in other words, <b>cloaked</b> <b>in</b> {{the guise of a}} hip-hop roughneck." [...] Shapiro viewed the vocal production as similar to that of Prince's Sign o' the Times (1987). The album's closing track [...] "Higher" [...] features D'Angelo's organ set to a choir of his overdubbed vocals, while [...] "Jonz in My Bonz", which compares love to an addiction, features D'Angelo's falsetto moans overdubbed in an array for effect.|$|E
500|$|In a mixed analysis, Amy Pettifer of The Quietus {{called it}} [...] "a Ted-talk of well-worn, motivational {{encouragement}} <b>cloaked</b> <b>in</b> a club anthem." [...] Saaed Saaed of The National called the album's [...] "mini slump," [...] while Jonh Murphy of musicOMH {{noted that the}} song [...] "falls rather flat." [...] Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club was confused with the song's message, saying that it [...] "can’t decide {{if it wants to}} skewer fame or encourage people to embrace it." [...] Lydia Jenkins wrote for New Zealand Herald that the song [...] "could definitely be accused of trying to emulate the success of Katy Perry's 'Dark Horse." [...] Lauren Murphy of The Irish Times dismissed Tyson's appearance, declaring that his spoken word turn on 'Iconic' is tokenistic." [...] Sasha Geffen of Consequence of Sound criticized the song's [...] "lazy rhymes", which according to herself, lumps into [...] "an awkward hybrid of EDM and hip-hop featuring one of hip-hop's finest [...] sounds out of place here amid the bass drops and robot vocals." ...|$|E
500|$|The Home Fleet {{initiated}} a further four raids against Tirpitz between April and July 1944, though the battleship was only attacked {{during the last}} of these operations. These attacks were hindered by the transfer {{of many of the}} Home Fleet's airmen to other units following Operation Tungsten, as the replacement aircrew were less experienced. The first raid (Operation Planet) began on 21 April but cancelled three days later when agents stationed near Kaafjord reported bad weather over the target area. The Home Fleet put to sea to attack Tirpitz again in mid-May in what was designated Operation Brawn. A strike force of 27 Barracudas escorted by Vought F4U Corsair and Supermarine Seafire fighters took off from the carriers [...] and Victorious on 15 May, but returned to the ships without attacking after they encountered heavy cloud over Kaafjord. The next raid, Operation Tiger Claw, was initiated in late May but cancelled due to bad weather on the 28th of the month. The subsequent attack (Operation Mascot) was timed for mid-July, before the resumption of the Arctic convoys, which had been suspended since April 1944 to free up ships for the Normandy landings. The strike force of 44 Barracudas and 40 fighters dispatched on 17 July reached the target area, but found Tirpitz <b>cloaked</b> <b>in</b> a protective smokescreen and the attack failed to inflict any damage on the battleship.|$|E

500|$|In {{the next}} section, the song [...] "Devil Wouldn't Recognize You" [...] {{featured}} Madonna atop a piano, <b>cloaked</b> <b>in</b> a black shroud.

Madonna then performed [...] "Spanish Lesson", featuring a flamenco-influenced dance solo by Alexander Kolpakov. She played the guitar once again for [...] "Miles Away". [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] featured the Ukrainian-gypsy group, Kolpakov Trio, incorporating the gypsy wedding song, [...] "Lela Pala Tute". At the end of the song, Madonna marched ahead with a band of violin players {{to the front of the}} stage and then sat aside with her dancers for a solo performance from Kolpakov Trio, who performed the traditional song [...] "Doli Doli". She returned to the stage for [...] "You Must Love Me", the Academy Award winning song from, Evita. The act ended with [...] "Get Stupid", a video interlude portraying global warming, famine and other global issues, while juxtaposing John McCain with Hitler and Barack Obama with Gandhi. In the final act, Madonna appeared on stage for a duet of the song [...] "4 Minutes" [...] with Justin Timberlake and Timbaland, both of them appearing on screens. A remix of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] followed, featuring elements from [...] "Feels Like Home" [...] and video screens depicting messages from the Bible, the Quran, the Torah and the Talmud. The electric guitar was played by Madonna for the performance of [...] "Ray of Light". She then sought audience participation, asking them to request for [...] "an oldie but goodie". Madonna sang the first verse and chorus of the requested song, before moving onto a rock version of [...] "Hung Up". After a brief video featuring a modern take on classic arcade games was played, Madonna returned on stage for the finale performance, [...] "Give It 2 Me", ending the song with a sing-a-long of the chorus.
