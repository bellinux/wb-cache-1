5|$|Lara <b>Croft</b> Go is a 2015 turn-based puzzle {{video game}} in the Tomb Raider series. The player moves Lara <b>Croft</b> as a puzzle piece through a board game while {{avoiding}} obstacles and manipulating the environment. The developers distilled major series motifs, such as boulder chases and reaction-based gameplay, to suit Lara <b>Croft</b> Go time-independent gameplay. Square Enix Montreal developed the game as a spiritual successor to its 2014 Hitman Go, based on another Square Enix franchise. The company released Lara <b>Croft</b> Go in August 2015 for Android, iOS, Windows, and Windows Phone devices. A version for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita was unveiled in November 2016. In 4. December 2016. it's released on Steam.|$|E
5|$|At E3 2015, Square Enix Montreal {{announced}} Lara <b>Croft</b> Go, {{a successor}} to Hitman Go set within the Tomb Raider universe. It was released on 27 August 2015. In the game, players use touchscreen controls to move Lara <b>Croft</b> around a level composed of nodes and lines. While the core mechanics and design are similar to Hitman Go, the developers did not want Lara <b>Croft</b> Go {{to feel like a}} re-skin, so an emphasis has been placed on the puzzle-driven exploration and gameplay elements of the Tomb Raider brand. The following year, Square Enix Montreal announced a similar title Deus Ex Go, based on the Deus Ex series.|$|E

5|$|Lara's backstory {{has changed}} {{dramatically}} {{over the course of}} the series. During the first era, game manuals describe the character as the Wimbledon, London-born daughter of Lord Henshingly <b>Croft</b> (Lord Richard <b>Croft</b> in Legend and its sequels). She was raised as an aristocrat and betrothed to the fictitious Earl of Farringdon. Lara attended the Scottish boarding school Gordonstoun and a Swiss finishing school. At the age of twenty-one, she survived a plane crash, which left her stranded in the Himalayas for two weeks; the experience spurred her to shun her former life and seek other adventures around the world. <b>Croft</b> published books and other written works based on her exploits as a mercenary, big-game hunter, and master thief.|$|E

5|$|The {{team also}} {{emphasized}} gameplay for the player to learn without tutorial and storytelling {{that did not}} interrupt the play experience. Compared to the previous game, the developers wanted Lara <b>Croft</b> Go puzzles to have fewer elements and be completely visible without scrolling, such that the player could see puzzles in their entirety and focus instead on solving for the correct sequence. The camera also follows <b>Croft</b> rather than remaining stationary.|$|E
5|$|Although the xx {{had been}} {{strongly}} influenced by R acts, the album also drew comparisons from critics to alternative rock, electronica, and post-punk sounds. The melancholic songs on xx featured minimalist arrangements and were built around Smith's beats, Oliver Sim's basslines, and sparse guitar figures played by Baria Qureshi and Romy Madley <b>Croft,</b> who employed reverb in her lead guitar parts. Most of them were sung as low-key duets by <b>Croft</b> and Sim, both of whom wrote emotional lyrics about love, intimacy, loss, and desire.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{consider}} Lara <b>Croft</b> {{a significant}} game character in popular culture. She holds six Guinness World Records, {{has a strong}} fan following, and is among the first video game characters to be successfully adapted to film. Lara <b>Croft</b> is also considered a sex symbol, {{one of the earliest}} in the industry to achieve widespread attention. The character's influence in the industry has been a point of contention among critics; viewpoints range from a positive agent of change in video games to a negative role model for young girls.|$|E

5|$|Eidos hired several {{models to}} portray Lara <b>Croft</b> at {{publicity}} events, promotions, trade shows, and photo shoots. Nathalie Cook {{was the first}} model, portraying the character from 1996 to 1997. Cook was followed by British actress Rhona Mitra from 1997 to 1998. Eidos then updated the <b>Croft</b> costume to match its video game depiction. Core Design reportedly restricted Mitra's dialogue as the character at trade shows and out of costume. French model Vanessa Demouy succeeded Mitra {{for a brief time}} until fashion model Nell McAndrew took over the role at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo. McAndrew portrayed <b>Croft</b> from 1998 until 1999, when Eidos fired her for posing in Playboy, which used the character and Tomb Raider franchise to promote the McAndrew's issue without Eidos's approval. Core Design was granted an injunction against the magazine to protect the character's image; Playboy was ordered to place stickers {{on the cover of the}} issue to conceal the reference to Tomb Raider. Eidos later donated McAndrew's Tomb Raider costume to a UNICEF charity auction.|$|E
