40|$|Background: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the manifest refractive error (ΔM), the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> apical corneal power (ΔACP) and initial corneal asphericity (Q) in overnight orthokeratology (ortho-K). Methods: One hundred and twenty-eight clinical records of children undergoing ortho-K from a university optometry clinic were reviewed. The refractive and topographical data at baseline and at two-week visit of 58 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were retrieved and analysed. Results: Significant differences (p < 0. 001) between the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error and <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the apical corneal power or the maximum <b>change</b> <b>in</b> corneal power (ΔMCP) within the treatment zone were found. Linear regression analysis was used to describe the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error and the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> apical corneal power, and the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error and the maximum <b>change</b> <b>in</b> corneal power, with the equations: ΔM = 0. 91 ΔACP + 0. 57 (r = 0. 78, p < 0. 001) and ΔM = 0. 93 ΔMCP + 0. 01 (r = 0. 79, p < 0. 001) respectively. On average, the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> apical corneal power underestimated the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error by 0. 34 ± 0. 57 D; whereas on average, the maximum <b>change</b> <b>in</b> corneal power overestimated the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error by 0. 23 ± 0. 57 D (paired-t-tests, p < 0. 001). A low but significant correlation between initial corneal asphericity and the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error (Spearman r = - 0. 33, p = 0. 01) was observed. Conclusions: The <b>change</b> <b>in</b> apical corneal power underestimates the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error in ortho-K, whereas the maximum <b>change</b> <b>in</b> corneal power overestimates this parameter. Compared with retinoscopy and autorefraction, the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> apical corneal power is still useful for estimation of the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error. Although the maximum <b>change</b> <b>in</b> corneal power appears to give a closer estimation of the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error than the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> apical corneal power, there is no advantage in the use of maximum corneal power (manually located) instead of apical corneal power (a default given by the topographer) to estimate the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error, as there is {{no significant difference in the}} estimations by either parameter.

40|$|Despite the {{recovery}} of economic growth in Latin America during the 1990 s, rising unemployment, high informality rates and sluggish wages lie {{at the root of}} high inequality and poverty. This paper looks at <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> hourly earnings from the early 1990 s to the early 2000 s in three relatively stable countries: Brazil, Chile and Mexico. Using econometric techniques, the paper decomposes the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> earnings per worker into <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the demographic and socio-occupational characteristics of workers, <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the returns to such characteristics, and <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> unobservable factors. The paper attempts to address the link between labour markets and the dynamics of inequality and poverty by comparing the average performance of the entire working labour force with the performance of the 20 per cent of workers with the lowest earnings. The paper finds that earnings per worker are the result of slow-moving <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the structure of employment and the characteristics of workers, as well as rapid <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the prices of labour for specific workers. Demographic changes, better education and the decline of agricultural labour are among the most significant <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the structure of employment, and they contribute to observed <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> earnings. Among the most important <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> prices contributing to the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> earnings are <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the returns to formal and informal employees relative to the self-employed; changes to full-time employment relative to part-time workers; <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the returns to urban workers relative to rural workers; and <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the earnings of workers in services relative to workers in agriculture. <b>In</b> general, <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> earnings frequently favoured low-earning workers, mostly because of the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the returns for their labour.
