If the result is negative, Case III profits are taken as nil, with the negative result being treated as non-trading debits.

Information and skills are constructed out of ‘little pieces’ into a whole relevant to the situation at the time.

5000|$|Robert van Voren of the Global Initiative on Psychiatry {{says the}} {{emergence}} of individual cases of political abuse of psychiatry in Russia {{is directly related to}} the deterioration of the human rights situation and to the fact that on-the-spot authorities feel more carefree than they did before, and deal with undesirable elements at their own discretion. The aura of inviolability is returned to the Russian rulers, the rule of law becomes subject to political machinations. Everything points to the fact that Russia still has the structure to exercise political abuse of psychiatry. Both political and economic nomenklatura is quite powerful and would not stop short at using illegal means especially now, when the political nomenklatura has absorbed economic power from Russian oligarchs, and the country is, in fact, ruled by the circle of people who came directly from the KGB whose capacities to establish control are limitless. This does not bode well for the future. According to Eduard Kuznetsov, [...] "More than 50 percent of the key state positions are occupied by former KGB officials. The KGB officials have a specific mentality. They can't change. There is a danger that it will really be a police state. Not so straightforward as it was under Brezhnev, because there is inertia, because they have to balance between the of the free world and a controlled society." [...] The same occasionally happens in many countries monitored by the Global Initiative on Psychiatry. Psychiatry is regarded as a handy tool to solve disputes, and one can easily buy a diagnosis from a psychiatrist. In most of the countries, forensic psychiatry has changed only slightly, the strong resistance to introducing the modern practices of forensic psychiatry is due to not disparities in schools or views but the fact that the reform of the system would mean the end of corruption. Criminals pay off their imprisonment of many years by having themselves declared insane. Wealthy husbands declare about the mental illnesses in their wives to get rid of them and yet keep control over their children. Children declare their parents and grandparents legally incapable to sell their apartments. Even medical institutions recognize their patients as insane to take their property. It is just a press for printing money. Today the Russian opposition cannot expect the type of help the West gave in Soviet times. Supporting Soviet dissidents was part of anti-Soviet policy but now pragmatism and precise <b>calculation</b> <b>rules.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Many useful <b>calculation</b> <b>rules,</b> such as fusion and tupling, rely on well-structured functions, {{especially}} {{in terms of}} inputs and outputs. For instance, fusion requires that well-produced outputs should be connected to well-consumed inputs, so that unnecessary intermediate data structures can be eliminated. These <b>calculation</b> <b>rules</b> generally fail to work unless functions are well-structured. In this paper, we propose a new calculation rule called IO swapping. IO swapping exchanges call-time computations (occurring in the arguments) and return-time computations (occurring in the results) of a function, while guaranteeing that the original and resulting function compute the same value. IO swapping enables us to rearrange inputs and outputs so that the existing <b>calculation</b> <b>rules</b> can be applied. We present new systematic derivations of efficient programs for detecting palindromes, and a method of higherorder removal that can be applied to defunctionalize function arguments, as two concrete applications. ...|$|E

40|$|To help {{understand}} the high activity of silver as an oxidation catalyst, e. g., for the oxidation of ethylene to epoxide and the dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde, the interaction {{and stability of}} oxygen species at the Ag(111) surface has been studied {{for a wide range}} of coverages. Through calculation of the free energy, as obtained from density-functional theory and taking into account the temperature and pressure via the oxygen chemical potential, we obtain the phase diagram of O/Ag(111). Our results reveal that a thin surface-oxide structure is most stable for the temperature and pressure range of ethylene epoxidation and we propose it (and possibly other similar structures) contains the species actuating the catalysis. For higher temperatures, low coverages of chemisorbed oxygen are most stable, which could also play a role in oxidation reactions. For temperatures greater than about 775 K there are no stable oxygen species, except for the possibility of O atoms adsorbed at under-coordinated surface sites Our <b>calculations</b> <b>rule</b> out thicker oxide-like structures, as well as bulk dissolved oxygen and molecular ozone-like species, as playing a role in the oxidation reactions.

40|$|The most {{significant}} {{limitation of the}} imaging SAR in rain measurements is the ground return coupled to the rain cell. Here we report {{a study of the}} possibility of using the X-SAR and the C-band channel of SIR-C for rain measurement. Earlier signal-to-clutter <b>calculations</b> <b>rule</b> out the use of X-SAR at steeper off-vertical angles of incidence (i. e., 20 less than theta less than 50). Only rain rates greater than 30 mm/hr at angles of incidence greater than 60 degrees showed good signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR). This study involved calculations at vertical incidence. There is adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at vertical incidence, but the presence of high-range side-lobe levels leads to small SCR for measurement over oceans at both X and C bands. For larger rain thickness (greater than two km), the SCR gets better and smaller rain rates (greater than 10 mm/hr) can be measured. However, rain measurements over forests seem to be feasible at nadir even for smaller rain thickness (less than two km). We conclude that X band may be usable over the forest at vertical incidence to measure rain rates greater than five mm/hr even for shallow rain thickness and over ocean for large rain thickness...|$|R
