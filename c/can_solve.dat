5|$|Anomalous X-ray {{scattering}} (MAD or SAD phasing)– the X-ray wavelength may be scanned past an {{absorption edge}} of an atom, which changes the scattering in a known way. By recording full sets of reflections at three different wavelengths (far below, far above {{and in the middle}} of the absorption edge) one <b>can</b> <b>solve</b> for the substructure of the anomalously diffracting atoms and hence the structure of the whole molecule. The most popular method of incorporating anomalous scattering atoms into proteins is to express the protein in a methionine auxotroph (a host incapable of synthesizing methionine) in a media rich in seleno-methionine, which contains selenium atoms. A MAD experiment can then be conducted around the absorption edge, which should then yield the position of any methionine residues within the protein, providing initial phases.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a methodology, called decomposition-based reductions, for showing the equivalence among various problems of bounded-width. First, {{we show that}} the following are equivalent for any α > 0 : * SAT <b>can</b> be <b>solved</b> in O^*(2 ^αtw) time, * 3 -SAT <b>can</b> be <b>solved</b> in O^*(2 ^αtw) time, * Max 2 -SAT <b>can</b> be <b>solved</b> in O^*(2 ^αtw) time, * Independent Set <b>can</b> be <b>solved</b> in O^*(2 ^αtw) time, and * Independent Set <b>can</b> be <b>solved</b> in O^*(2 ^αcw) time, where tw and cw are the tree-width and clique-width of the instance, respectively. Then, we {{introduce a}} new parameterized complexity class EPNL, which includes Set Cover and Directed Hamiltonicity, and show that SAT, 3 -SAT, Max 2 -SAT, and Independent Set parameterized by path-width are EPNL-complete. This implies that if one of these EPNL-complete problems <b>can</b> be <b>solved</b> in O^*(c^k) time, then any problem in EPNL <b>can</b> be <b>solved</b> in O^*(c^k) time.

The Institute promotes Engelbart's philosophy for boosting Collective IQ—the concept of dramatically improving how we <b>can</b> <b>solve</b> important problems together—using a strategic bootstrapping approach for accelerating our progress toward that goal. In 2005, Engelbart received a National Science Foundation grant to fund the open source HyperScope project. The Hyperscope team built a browser component using Ajax and Dynamic HTML designed to replicate Augment's multiple viewing and jumping capabilities (linking within and across various documents).|$|E
5|$|One <b>can</b> <b>solve</b> these problems, {{according}} to Fodor, with functionalism, a hypothesis {{which was designed}} to overcome the failings of both dualism and reductionism. What is important is the function of a mental state regardless of the physical substrate which implements it. The foundation for this view lies in the principle of the multiple realizability of the mental. Under this view, for example, I and a computer can both instantiate ("realize") the same functional state though we are made of completely different material stuff (see graphic at right). On this basis functionalism can be classified as a form of token materialism.|$|E

5|$|Crystal {{structures}} of proteins (which are irregular {{and hundreds of}} times larger than cholesterol) began to be solved in the late 1950s, beginning with the structure of sperm whale myoglobin by Sir John Cowdery Kendrew, for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Max Perutz in 1962. Since that success, 132055 X-ray crystal {{structures of}} proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules have been determined. For comparison, the nearest competing method in terms of structures analyzed is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which has resolved 11904 chemical structures. Moreover, crystallography <b>can</b> <b>solve</b> structures of arbitrarily large molecules, whereas solution-state NMR is restricted to relatively small ones (less than 70 kDa). X-ray crystallography is now used routinely by scientists to determine how a pharmaceutical drug interacts with its protein target and what changes might improve it. However, intrinsic membrane proteins remain challenging to crystallize because they require detergents or other means to solubilize them in isolation, and such detergents often interfere with crystallization. Such membrane proteins are a large component of the genome, and include many proteins of great physiological importance, such as ion channels and receptors. Helium cryogenics are used to prevent radiation damage in protein crystals.|$|E
5|$|Similar to its predecessor, Brain Age 2 is an {{edutainment}} {{video game}} that offers the player several minigames to play. Before the game begins, the player must create a profile, after which Brain Age Check runs three random {{tests to determine}} the player's brain age, which ranges from 20 to 80 and depends on the player's test performance. The brain age determines approximately the responsiveness of the player's brain; a brain age of 20, the lowest age that the player can achieve, indicates that the player's brain is as responsive as that of an average 20-year-old. Once the player is told their initial brain age, three modes are unlocked: Quick Play, Daily Training, and Sudoku. In Quick Play, the player can practice {{with any of the}} available minigames without receiving a score. In Daily Training, the player can perform Brain Age Check to determine their updated brain age. They can also complete one of the available minigames, after which they are given a rating based on their performance. In Daily Training, the player can also play Virus Buster, a simplified version of Dr. Mario (1990) modified for mobile play. To let the player track their progress, the game saves daily statistics of the player's performance, which are shown in a graph. In the third mode, Sudoku, the player <b>can</b> <b>solve</b> one of a hundred Sudoku puzzles.|$|E
