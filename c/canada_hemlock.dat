It generally occupies richer and less acidic soils than the spruce and firs and is characteristic of deep, shaded and moist mountain valleys and coves. It is, unfortunately, subject to the hemlock woolly adelgid (...) , an introduced insect, that is rapidly extirpating it as a forest tree. Less abundant, and restricted to the southern Appalachians, is Carolina hemlock (...) [...] Like <b>Canada</b> <b>hemlock,</b> this tree suffers severely from the hemlock woolly adelgid.|$|E

The PEF was established in 1950 for the long-term study at the Penobscot Experimental Forest in purpose of conducting timber management research in east-central Maine, shelterwood silviculture reduced the northern conifers. At the time of establishment, the area was a hemlock component in regenerating stands compared to mix of even-aged and apparently uneven-aged stands. Even-parent stands, while hemlock increased in abundance and aged stands were 60 to 100 years old (Safford et al. 1969). dominance under selection silviculture.
