40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} our study was to {{evaluate}} all <b>contact</b> <b>pressures</b> between the molded ankle-foot orthosis (MAFO) and the subject during activities of daily living. The MAFOs studied are used clinically to reduce plantar <b>contact</b> <b>pressures</b> associat-ed with foot ulcers in adult neuropathic diabetic subjects, alle-viating abnormal pressures by redistributing them to low-pressure plantar regions. While effective, MAFOs are often not used by the subject due to weight and comfort issues. An understanding of the <b>contact</b> <b>pressures</b> between the subject and the orthosis {{is a first step}} in improving basic MAFO design. Four nonimpaired, young adult males were tested in this study. A right-side MAFO was custom-molded and fitted for each sub-ject by the same orthotist. Real-time pressures were obtained for the entire contact area using the F-Scan pressure measurement system. The data obtained demonstrated high <b>contact</b> <b>pressures</b> along the metatarsals of the foot, around the heel and ankle, and adjacent to the strap attachment sites. No <b>contact</b> <b>pressures</b> were noted along the posterior calf region during any of the activities performed. These data suggest the calf region would be a suit-able site for material removal for weight reduction and increased comfort, especially in warm weather. In addition, these data may be useful to orthotists in improving the basic design and to researchers {{as a starting point for}} performing com-plex finite element analysis on the MAFO.

40|$|In this article, {{we report}} on a novel {{diaphragm-type}} tactile pressure sensor that produces stepwise output currents depending on varying low <b>contact</b> <b>pressures.</b> When <b>contact</b> <b>pressures</b> are applied to the stepped output tactile sensor (SOTS), the sensorâs suspended diaphragm makes contact with the substrate, which completes a circuit by connecting resistive current paths.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{major cause}} of the limited {{longevity}} of total ankle replacements is premature polyethylene component wear, which can be induced by high joint <b>contact</b> <b>pressures.</b> We implemented a computational model to parametrically explore the hypothesis that intercomponent positioning deviating from the manufacturer's recommendations can result in pressure distributions that may predispose to wear of the polyethylene insert. We also investigated the hypothesis that a modern mobile-bearing design {{may be able to}} better compensate for imposed misalignments compared with an early two-component design. METHODS: Two finite element models of total ankle replacement prostheses were built to quantify peak and average <b>contact</b> <b>pressures</b> on the polyethylene insert surfaces. Models were validated by biomechanical testing of the two implant designs with use of pressure-sensitive film. The validated models were configured to replicate three potential misalignments with the most CLINICAL RELEVANCE: version of the tibial component, version of the talar component, and relative component rotation of the two-component design. The misalignments were simulated with use of the computer model with physiologically relevant boundary loads. RESULTS: With use of the manufacturer's guidelines for positioning of the two-component design, the predicted average joint <b>contact</b> <b>pressures</b> exceeded the yield stress of polyethylene (18 to 20 MPa). Pressure magnitudes increased as implant alignment was systematically deviated from this reference position.
