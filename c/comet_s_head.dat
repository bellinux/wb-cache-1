In the early nineteenth century, a shop called 2 ̆ 2 At the sign of the Turk 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Head</b> 2 ̆ 2 existed in the Building 2 ̆ 7 s location. The shopkeeper, Jacob Whitman, installed a figurehead from an Ottoman Empire ship above the shop 2 ̆ 7 s doors.

40|$|AbstractThe ribosomal {{translocation}} involves both intersubunit rotations {{between the}} small 30 S and large 50 S subunits and the intrasubunit rotations of the 30 <b>S</b> <b>head</b> {{relative to the}} 30 S body. However, the detailed molecular mechanism on how the intersubunit and intrasubunit rotations {{are related to the}} translocation remains unclear. Here, based on available structural data a model is proposed for the ribosomal translocation, into which both the intersubunit and intrasubunit rotations are incorporated. With the model, we provide quantitative explanations of in vitro experimental data showing the biphasic character in the fluorescence change associated with the mRNA translocation and the character of a rapid increase that is followed by a slow single-exponential decrease in the fluorescence change associated with the 30 <b>S</b> <b>head</b> rotation. The calculated translation rate is also consistent with the in vitro single-molecule experimental data...|$|R

40|$|Intelligent {{interfaces}} {{that make}} use of the user 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>head</b> pose or facial features in order to interpret the user 2 ̆ 7 s identity or point of attention, are finding increasing application in numerous fields. Although various techniques exist to passively track the user 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> gaze or <b>head</b> pose using monocular or stereo cameras, these systems generally cannot perceive in detail the characteristic three-dimensional (3 D) profile of the user 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>head</b> or face. Time-of-flight cameras, such as the Swiss Ranger SR- 3000, are a recent innovation capable of providing three-dimensional image data from a single sensor. The advent of such sensors opens up new possibilities in the fields of head-pose tracking and face recognition. In this paper we propose a novel 3 D time-of-flight camera system for robust and accurate head-pose tracking in real-time.
