5|$|Low {{back pain}} may be {{classified}} {{based on the}} signs and symptoms. Diffuse pain that does not change in response to particular movements, and is localized to the lower back without radiating beyond the buttocks, is classified as nonspecific, the most <b>common</b> <b>classification.</b> Pain that radiates down the leg below the knee, is located on one side (in the case of disc herniation), or is on both sides (in spinal stenosis), and changes in severity in response to certain positions or maneuvers is radicular, making up 7% of cases. Pain that is accompanied by red flags such as trauma, fever, a history of cancer or significant muscle weakness may indicate a more serious underlying problem and is classified as needing urgent or specialized attention.|$|E

25|$|Stećci are {{described}} as stone, monolithic, horizontal and vertical tombstones prismatic shape with flat or gable-top surface, with or without pedestal. The <b>common</b> <b>classification</b> was established by Dmitrij Sergejevski in 1952, dividing them on recumbent and standing types. Up until now the systematization of stećci is not finished, according to Šefik Bešlagić there exist seven types of form: a slab, a chest, a chest with a pedestal, a ridge/gable, a ridge/gable with a pedestal, a pillar, a cross, while according to Lovrenović nine types in Radimlja: slab, slab with pedestal, chest, chest with pedestal, tall chest, tall chest with pedestal, sarcophagus (i.e. ridge/gable), sarcophagus with pedestal, cruciform.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, the {{question}} of whether Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian languages are dialects of a single language or three separate languages was actively discussed, with the debate affected by linguistic and political factors. The political situation (Ukraine and Belarus being mainly part of the Russian Empire at the time) and the historical existence of the medieval state of Kievan Rus', which occupied large parts of these three nations, {{led to the creation of}} the <b>common</b> <b>classification</b> known later as the East Slavic languages. The underlying theory of the grouping is their descent from a common ancestor. In modern times, Ukrainian, Russian, and Belarusian are usually listed by linguists as separate languages.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>common</b> <b>classification</b> of the Lepidoptera {{involves}} their differentiation into {{butterflies and}} moths. [...] Butterflies are a natural monophyletic group, often given the suborder Rhopalocera, which includes Papilionoidea (true butterflies), Hesperiidae (skippers), and Hedylidae (butterfly moths). In this taxonomic scheme moths {{belong to the}} suborder Heterocera. Other taxonomic schemes have been proposed; the most common putting the butterflies into the suborder Ditrysia and then the [...] "superfamily" [...] Papilionoidea, and ignoring a classification for moths. However none of the taxonomic schemes are perfect, and taxonomists commonly argue over how to define the obvious differences between butterflies and moths.|$|E
2500|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} energy necessary for arc welding processes, {{a number of}} different power supplies can be used. [...] The most <b>common</b> <b>classification</b> is constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. [...] In arc welding, the voltage {{is directly related to the}} length of the arc, and the current is related to the amount of heat input. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. [...] Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. [...] In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. [...] For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|E
