The lateritic soil samples were selected and treated with 0 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 % of MHA by weight of laterite. The lateritic soil-MHA mixture was later admixed with 0 %, 2 %, 4 %, 6 %, 8 %, 10 %, 12 % and 14 % <b>cut-back</b> <b>bitumen</b> solution by weight of laterite. Both the natural lateritic soil, lateritic and MHA, and the blend of Soil, MHA and Bitumen were first subjected to physical and chemical analysis using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and Scanning Electromagnetic Machine (SEM) to determine their engineering properties followed by the performance test on bricks cast with varying quantities of the additives. A total of one hundred and ninety two (192) cubes were tested for moisture absorption, erodability and compressive strength tests. The result of the test showed that MHA and Bitumen acted as pozzolana in performance test on the soil blocks. Up to 30 % MHA â€“ laterite and 20 % MHA admixed with 8 % laterite were found to give optimum compressive strength of 10. 8 N/mm 2 and 10. 9 N/mm 2 for the bricks produced. The result also showed that about 50 % MHA blended with 14 % Bitumen solution ensured water tight bricks. Thus the use of MHA as partial replacement of cement will provide an economic use of by-product and consequently produce a cheaper soil block construction without comprising its strength...|$|E
