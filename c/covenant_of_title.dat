50|$|The {{suit was}} brought for breach <b>of</b> <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> {{warranty}} <b>of</b> <b>title</b> to a {{tract of land}} in Kansas. Plaintiff in error was defendant below. Its title was derived from grants of public land {{to aid in the}} construction of a railway to the Pacific. The tract was within the location of the railroad grants, but was excepted from those grants by reason of a homestead entry and possession. Subsequent to this entry and possession, the party so in possession took title from the railroad company, and the homestead entry was cancelled. The alleged paramount adverse title was derived from a patent from the United States issued on a homestead entry made subsequent to these proceedings. The Supreme Court of Kansas found that there was a breach of the warranty, and rendered judgment accordingly. This writ of error was brought to review that judgment.|$|R

5|$|Covenant {{theology}} is an interpretive framework used by Reformed theologians which was significantly {{developed during the}} seventeenth century. Under this scheme, as articulated by the Assembly, God's dealings with men are {{described in terms of}} two covenants: the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works and <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace. The Westminster Confession was the first major Reformed symbol to explicitly mention the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works (sometimes called the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> life), in which God offered Adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience. In the fall of man, Adam broke the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. To remedy this, God offered salvation apart from human initiative in what was called the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace. This <b>covenant</b> allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey God's law perfectly.

50|$|Concepts {{foundational}} {{to covenant}} theology {{can be found}} in the writings of Church Fathers such as Irenaeus and Augustine. Huldrych Zwingli and Johannes Oecolampadius were among the first reformers to speak of God's salvation economy under the categories <b>of</b> a <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works and a <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace. John Calvin (Institutes 2:9-11), like Heinrich Bullinger (A Brief Exposition of the One and Eternal Testament or <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> God), focused on the continuity <b>of</b> the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace, but taught the substance of what became classic covenant theology in terms of Law and Gospel. Early post-reformation writings, including Zacharius Ursinus (1534-83) in Commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism (published posthumously, 1591), Caspar Olevianus (1536-87) in Concerning the Substance <b>of</b> the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace between God and the Elect (De substantia foederis gratuiti inter deum et electos, 1585), and Scottish Theologian Robert Rollock (1555-99) in A Treatise of our Effectual Calling (Tractatus de vocatione efficaci, 1597), developed the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works and <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace scheme along the lines of the law-gospel distinction.|$|R

2500|$|Through the {{influence}} of Karl Barth, many contemporary Reformed theologians have discarded the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works, along with other concepts of federal theology. Barth saw the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works as disconnected from Christ and the gospel, and rejected the idea that God works with people in this way. Instead, Barth argued that God always interacts with people under the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace, and that the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace is free of all conditions whatsoever. Barth's theology and that which follows him has been called [...] "monocovenantal" [...] {{as opposed to the}} [...] "bi-covenantal" [...] scheme of classical federal theology. Conservative contemporary Reformed theologians, such as John Murray, have also rejected the idea <b>of</b> <b>covenants</b> based on law rather than grace.

50|$|Overview: Under the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Works humanity, {{represented}} ultimately in a covenantal sense under Adam beginning {{from the}} Garden of Eden, failed {{to live as}} God intended and stood condemned. But beyond time the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Redemption was made between the Father and Son, to agree that Christ would live an acceptable substitutionary life on behalf of, and as a covenantal representative for, those who would sin but would trust in Christ as their covenantal substitutionary representative, which bought them into the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace. The <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace applies to all who trust Christ for their salvation, regardless of ethnicity, and thus the Covenant covers Jews and Gentiles alike with regard to salvation, sanctification, and resurrection. The <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace forms the basis <b>of</b> the later <b>covenants</b> with Noah, Abraham, Moses, David and the New Covenant in Christ.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace {{promises}} {{eternal life}} for all people who have faith in Christ. He also promises the Holy Spirit to the elect to give them willingness and ability to believe. Christ is the substitutionary covenantal representative fulfilling the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works on their behalf, in both the positive requirements of righteousness and its negative penal consequences (commonly described as his active and passive obedience). It is the historical expression <b>of</b> the eternal <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> redemption. Genesis 3:15, {{with the promise of}} a [...] "seed" [...] of the woman who would crush the serpent's head, is usually identified as the historical inauguration for the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace.|$|R
50|$|Covenant {{theology}} first sees a <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works administered with Adam in the Garden of Eden. Upon Adam's failure, God {{established the}} <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace in the promised seed Genesis 3:15, and shows his redeeming care in clothing Adam and Eve in garments of skin — perhaps picturing {{the first instance}} of animal sacrifice. The specific covenants {{after the fall of}} Adam are seen as administered under the overarching theological <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> grace.|$|R
5000|$|Having created man in His {{image as}} a free {{creature}} with knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, God entered into a <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works whereby the mandate was [...] "do this and live" [...] (Romans 10:5, Galatians 3:12). [...] "Like Adam, they have trespassed the covenant" [...] (Hosea 6:7) is the classic reference to the <b>covenant</b> <b>of</b> works; Hebrews 8:6; 9:15; 12:24 the reference that explains God's work of redemption in the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace.|$|R
50|$|All the {{covenants}} that God makes {{with humans}} after the Fall, (e.g. with Noah, Abraham, Moses, and David) all extend the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace to its logical conclusion in Jesus Christ. In Covenant theology, however, {{there is a}} long-standing understanding that the Mosaic Covenant is also a republication <b>of</b> the <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Works, which required obedience to receive its benefits. The underlying <b>Covenant</b> <b>of</b> Grace extends through the whole Old Testament, which suggests that two covenants are in play throughout the history <b>of</b> Israel.
