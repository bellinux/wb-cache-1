The closed guard {{is a very powerful}} guard seen often in MMA style tournaments because of the amount of control it gives the bottom fighter and lack of necessity for grips to control top opponent and block his strikes.

30|$|Cut cores made of nanocrystalline Fe–Nb–Cu–B–Si alloy with linear loop {{are widely}} used in power {{electronics}} for the manufacture of linear and storage <b>chokes</b> as <b>well</b> as power reactors because these cores have lower remagnetization loss compared to crystalline ferrite cores and cut cores made of iron-based amorphous alloy [7].

40|$|A {{first order}} {{model for the}} {{behavior}} of a linear orifice pulse tube refrigerator (OPTR) was developed as a design tool for construction of actual OPTRs. The model predicts cooling power as well as the pressure/volume relationships for various segments of the refrigerator with minimal computational requirements. The first portion of this document describes the development of this model and its simplifications relative to higher-order numerical models. The second portion of this document details a physical implementation of the pulse tube and compares its performance to the predicted performance of the model. It was found that the model accurately predicted qualitative behavior and trends of the orifice pulse tube refrigerator, but that the predicted temperature difference was approximately five times higher than the measured temperature difference.

40|$|Supersonic ejector-diffuse {{systems have}} {{application}} in driving an advanced airbreathing propulsion system, consisting of turbojet engines {{acting as the}} primary and a single throat ramjet acting as the secondary. The turbojet engines are integrated into the single throat ramjet to minimize variable geometry and eliminate redundant propulsion components.

At this high Mach number (approximately Mach 3. 0), the turbojets are turned off and the high speed ramjet/scramjet take over and drive the vehicle to Mach 6. 0. The turbojet-ejector-ramjet system consists of nonafterburning turbojet engines with ducting canted at 20 degrees to supply supersonic flow (downstream of CD nozzle) to the horizontal ramjet duct at a supply total pressure and temperature.

The non-dimensional (or corrected flow) at compressor exit tends to stay constant, because it sees, beyond the combustor, the constant corrected flow of the choked turbine.
