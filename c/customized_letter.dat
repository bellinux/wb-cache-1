40|$|OBJECTIVE. Because of time {{constraints}} {{in the office}} environment, problems of con-cern to elderly patients may not be raised during clinic visits. To facilitate communi-cation about geriatric health problems, we examined {{the impact of a}} strategy that used patient self-assessment data to improve community practices. DESIGN. Twenty-two primary care practices were randomized to participate in the intervention strategy (intervention practices) or to provide usual care (usual care practices). SETTING. Primary care practices in 16 towns in New Hampshire (total, 45 physicians). PATIENTS. 1651 patients 70 years of age or older. INTERVENTION. All patients received a mailed survey that asked about their health problems and about how well these problems were being addressed by their physi-cians. In the intervention practices, these data were used to generate a <b>customized</b> <b>letter</b> that directed the patient to specific sections in an 80 -page modified version of the National Institute on Aging’s Age Pages and were summarized and communicat-ed to the patient’s physician...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{test the}} {{effectiveness}} of <b>customized,</b> family-oriented reminder <b>letters</b> in activating patients to seek appropriate preventive services. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. One group received computer-generated, <b>customized</b> <b>letters</b> explaining recommended preventive procedures for each family member. A second group received a form letter listing recommendations for all preventive procedures for all age and sex groups. A third group (control group) received no letters. SETTING: A private medical centre, without university affiliation, in rural Quebec. PARTICIPANTS: From 8770 patients who met study criteria, 719 families were randomly selected. Data were available for 1971 of 1998 patients in these families. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Family Received Index is the proportion of all procedures for which a family was overdue that they received. The Family End-of-study Up-to-date Index is the proportion of procedures for which the family was eligible and {{for which they were}} up-to-date {{at the end of the}} study. RESULTS: The Family Received Index for families mailed <b>customized</b> <b>letters</b> was more than double the index for patients not mailed letters (Kruskal-Wallis P =. 0139). Comparison of the Family End-of-study Up-to-date indices also demonstrated that families of patients sent <b>customized</b> <b>letters</b> were more likely to be up-to-date than families not sent letters (Kruskal-Wallis P =. 0054). No statistically significant difference appeared between the number of preventive measures received by the control group and the form-letter group. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a clinically small but statistically significant value to <b>customizing</b> reminder <b>letters...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{the move}} from paper to {{electronic}} public comments makes it much easier for individuals to <b>customize</b> form <b>letters</b> while harder for agencies to identify substantive information since there are many near-duplicate comments that express the same viewpoint in slightly different language.

40|$|ABSTRACT Excitement {{about the}} {{political}} science job market builds {{around the time of}} the Labor Day AnnualMeeting of the APSA, when schools start to post their openings for the next year. As we entered the job market, we found ourselves repeatedly collecting infor-mation about available positions as we prepared application materials. We monitored APSA’s eJobs website, cut and pasted relevant job information into a single spreadsheet, and assembled letters using that information. Here, we introduce free and open-source tools to automate these data collection and letter generationprocedures usingRandLaTeX. Our system minimizes manual data entry by extracting and creating a spreadsheet from APSA’s eJobs information. Wewalk applicants through the initial job search steps, includ-ing using eJobs, compiling position information, and producing attractive letters. As we entered the job market, we found ourselvesspending hours collecting information about jobopenings and preparing applications to send to hir-ing committees. First, we repeatedly transferredinformation about dozens of jobs from the web to a single spreadsheet. This process involved line-by-line cutting and pasting for every position towhichwe applied (most of which were drawn from APSA’s eJobs). Second, we manually created <b>customized</b> <b>letters</b> that drew information from our spreadsheet...|$|R
40|$|Compliance with {{preventive}} {{screening tests}} is inadequate in the United States. We describe a computer based system for generating reminder letters {{to patients who}} may have missed their indicated screening tests {{because they do not}} visit a provider regularly or missed their tests {{despite the fact that they}} do visit a provider. We started with national recommendations and generated a local consensus for test indications. We then used this set of indications and our electronic record to determine test deficiencies in our pilot pool of 3073 patients. The computer generated <b>customized</b> reminder <b>letters</b> targeting several tests. Physicians chose any patients who should not receive letters. The response rate for fecal occult blood (FOB) testing was 33 % compared with an 18 % historical compliance rate within the same community. FOB reminders generated improved test compliance. Test execution must be considered when commencing a program of screening test reminders...|$|R
40|$|Large volume {{public comment}} campaigns and web portals that {{encourage}} {{the public to}} <b>customize</b> form <b>letters</b> produce many near-duplicate documents, which increases processing and storage costs, but is rarely a serious problem. A more serious concern is that form letter customizations can include substantive issues that agencies are likely to overlook. The identification of exact- and near-duplicate texts, and recognition of unique text within nearduplicate documents, {{is an important component}} of data cleaning and integration processes for eRulemaking. This paper presents DURIAN (DUplicate Removal In lArge collectioN), a refinement of a prior near-duplicate detection algorithm DURIAN uses a traditional bag-of-words document representation, document attributes (&quot;metadata&quot;), and document content structure to identify form letters and their edited copies in public comment collections. Experimental results demonstrate that DURIAN is about as effective as human assessors. The paper concludes by discussing challenges to moving near-duplicate detection into operational rulemaking environments...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} Iowa’s Driver Improvement Program (DIP), measured as {{the reduction in the}} number of driver convictions subsequent to the DIP. The analysis involved a random sample of 9, 055 drivers who had been instructed to attend DIP and corresponding data on driver convictions, crashes, and driver education training history that were provided by the Iowa Motor Vehicle Division. The sample was divided into two groups based on DIP outcome: satisfactory or unsatisfactory completion. Two evaluation periods were considered: one year after the DIP date (probation period) and the period from the 13 th to 18 th month after the DIP date. The evaluation of Iowa’s DIP showed that there is evidence of effectiveness in terms of reducing driver convictions subsequent to attending the DIP. Among the 6, 790 (75 %) drivers who completed the course satisfactorily, 73 % of drivers had no actions and 93 % were not involved in a crash during the probation period. Statistical tests confirmed these numbers. However, the positive effect of satisfactory completion of DIP on survival time (that is, the time until the first conviction) was not statistically significant 13 months after the DIP date. Econometric model estimation results showed that, regardless of the DIP outcome, the likelihood of conviction occurrence and frequency of subsequent convictions depends on other factors, such as age, driver history, and DIP location, and interaction effects among these factors. Low-cost, early intervention measures are suggested to enhance the effectiveness of Iowa’s DIP. These measures can include advisory and warning <b>letters</b> (<b>customized</b> based on the driver’s age) sent within the first year after the DIP date and soon after the end of the probation period, as well as a closer examination of DIP instruction across the 17 community colleges that host the program. Given the large number of suspended drivers who continued to drive, consideration should also be given to measures to reduce driving while suspended offenses...|$|R
