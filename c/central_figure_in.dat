5|$|Bonds led a {{controversial}} career, notably as a <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> baseball's steroids scandal. In 2007, he was indicted {{on charges of}} perjury {{and obstruction of justice}} for allegedly lying to the grand jury during the federal government's investigation of BALCO. The perjury charges against Bonds were dropped and an initial obstruction of justice conviction was overturned in 2015.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Providence College {{was founded}} as an all-male school {{through the efforts}} of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence and the Dominican Province of St. Joseph. The <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> the college's {{incorporation}} was Matthew Harkins, Bishop of Providence, who sought an institution that would establish a center of advanced learning for the Catholic youth of Rhode Island.|$|E
5|$|A semi-legendary figure, Laozi {{was usually}} {{portrayed as a}} 6th-centuryBCE {{contemporary}} of Confucius, but most modern historians consider him, assuming he existed, to have lived during the Warring States period of the 5th or 4thcenturyBCE. A <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> Chinese culture, Laozi is claimed by both the emperors of the Tang dynasty and modern people of the Li surname as a founder of their lineage. Laozi's work has been embraced by both various anti-authoritarian movements as well as Chinese Legalism.|$|E

5|$|Berndt Von Üxküll – Von Üxkül is a {{paraplegic}} junker from Pomerania and {{a composer}} {{who is married}} to Una. A World War I veteran, he fought alongside Aue's father in the Freikorps, whom he describes as a sadist. Despite essentially agreeing with their nationalist and antisemitic ideology, he distances himself from the Nazis. His name is possibly a reference to Nikolaus Graf von Üxküll-Gyllenband, an anti-Nazi resistant and uncle of Claus von Stauffenberg, a <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> the failed plot to assassinate Hitler.|$|E
5|$|Disney {{remains the}} <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> {{the history of}} animation. Through {{technological}} innovations and alliances with governments and corporations, he transformed a minor studio in a marginal form of communication into a multinational leisure industry giant. Despite his critics, his vision of a modern, corporate utopia {{as an extension of}} traditional American values has possibly gained greater currency in the years after his death.|$|E
5|$|Sir William Alexander Gordon Gordon-Cumming, 4th Baronet (20 July 1848– 20 May 1930) was a Scottish landowner, soldier, adventurer and socialite. A notorious womaniser, he is {{best known}} for being the <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> the royal baccarat scandal of 1891. After inheriting a baronetcy he joined the Army and saw service in South Africa, Egypt and the Sudan; he served with {{distinction}} and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Something of an adventurer, he also spent time hunting in the US and India.|$|E

5|$|Structure 5D-82 is {{the northernmost}} {{structure}} adjoining the East Platform. The {{first version of}} this building {{was built in the}} 4th century AD. This early version was a semicircular platform supporting a building that possessed a single chamber. This building was decorated with an elaborate stucco frieze decorated with anthropomorphic figures and glyphs. The <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> the frieze is believed by archaeologists to represent the deity Itzamna.|$|E
5|$|Arthur is a <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> {{the legends}} {{making up the}} Matter of Britain. The legendary Arthur {{developed}} as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain). In some Welsh and Breton tales and poems that date from before this work, Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore, sometimes associated with the Welsh Otherworld, Annwn. How much of Geoffrey's Historia (completed in 1138) was adapted from such earlier sources, rather than invented by Geoffrey himself, is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Ramza is chased {{throughout}} the story by the Shrine Knights, {{the soldiers of}} the Church who are hunting the Zodiac Stones, although he gains allies, either by saving their lives, or by showing them the truth. Some individuals {{with knowledge of the}} Zodiac Stones attempt to conspire with the Shrine Knights for its power, though most fail. Ramza also acquires proof of the Church's lies about Saint Ajora, a <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> the religion, and attempts to use it along with the Zodiac Stone to reveal the organization's plot.|$|E

5|$|Wallace {{was raised}} in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. When he {{released}} his debut album Ready to Die in 1994, he became a <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> the East Coast hip hop scene and increased New York City's visibility in the genre at a time when West Coast hip hop was dominant in the mainstream. The following year, Wallace led his childhood friends to chart success through his protégé group, Junior M.A.F.I.A. While recording his second album, Wallace was heavily involved in the growing East Coast–West Coast hip hop feud.|$|E
5|$|With her {{formidable}} physique and outspoken manner, Braddock was a pugnacious {{presence in}} parliament, and a keen {{supporter of the}} 1945–51 Attlee ministry's reform agenda, particularly {{the establishment of the}} National Health Service in 1948. She served on Labour's National Executive Committee between 1947 and 1969. Her combative style led to a brief suspension from parliament in 1952. For most of her parliamentary career she remained a member of Liverpool's council, and was a <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> the controversy that arose in the 1950s over the city's decision to acquire and flood the Tryweryn Valley in Wales {{for the construction of a}} reservoir.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp (March 19, 1848– January 13, 1929) was an American Old West gambler, {{a deputy}} sheriff in Pima County, and deputy town marshal in Tombstone, Arizona Territory, {{who took part}} in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, during which lawmen killed three outlaw cowboys. He is often mistakenly {{regarded}} as the <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> the shootout in Tombstone, although his brother Virgil was Tombstone city marshal and deputy U.S. marshal that day, and had far more experience as a sheriff, constable, marshal, and soldier in combat.|$|E

5|$|A 5 hours, 9 {{minutes long}} biographical {{documentary}} film, , made by Vithalbhai Jhaveri in 1968, quoting Gandhi's words and using black & white archival footage and photographs, captures {{the history of}} those times. Ben Kingsley portrayed him in Richard Attenborough's 1982 film Gandhi, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. The 1996 film The Making of the Mahatma documented Gandhi's time in South Africa and his transformation from an inexperienced barrister to recognised political leader. Gandhi was a <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> the 2006 Bollywood comedy film Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Jahnu Barua's Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara (I did not kill Gandhi), places contemporary society as a backdrop with its vanishing memory of Gandhi's values {{as a metaphor for}} the senile forgetfulness of the protagonist of his 2005 film, writes Vinay Lal.|$|E
5|$|Glastonbury {{may have}} been a site of {{religious}} importance in pre-Christian times. The abbey was founded by Britons, and dates to at least the early 7th century, although later medieval Christian legend claimed that the abbey was founded by Joseph of Arimathea in the 1st century. This fanciful legend is intimately tied to Robert de Boron's version of the Holy Grail story and to Glastonbury's connection to King Arthur, which dates at least to the early 12th century. Glastonbury fell into Saxon hands after the Battle of Peonnum in 658. King Ine of Wessex enriched the endowment of the community of monks already established at Glastonbury. He is said to have directed that a stone church be built in 712. The Abbey Church was enlarged in the 10th century by the Abbot of Glastonbury, Saint Dunstan, the <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> the 10th-century revival of English monastic life. He instituted the Benedictine Rule at Glastonbury and built new cloisters. Dunstan became Archbishop of Canterbury in 960. In 1184, a great fire at Glastonbury destroyed the monastic buildings. Reconstruction began almost immediately and the Lady Chapel, which includes the well, was consecrated in 1186.|$|E
5|$|Her husband's {{early death}} in 1962 forced Stokes {{to return to}} {{painting}} as a career, resulting in a successful one-woman show in 1964, her first in thirty years. She continued to paint and exhibit through the 1970s and 1980s, and {{was the subject of}} a retrospective exhibition that toured Victorian regional galleries including Swan Hill Regional Art Gallery and Geelong Art Gallery in 1985. She died in 1991 and is little-known in comparison to some other women artists including Grace Cossington Smith and Clarice Beckett, but her fortunes were revived somewhat as a <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> Anne Summers' 2009 book The Lost Mother. Her art is represented in most major Australian galleries, including the National Gallery of Australia and the National Gallery of Victoria; the Art Gallery of New South Wales is the only significant Australian collecting institution not to hold one of her works.|$|E

5|$|In America Widmerpool becomes {{something}} of a figurehead among youth protest movements; there are suggestions that his earlier problems may have resulted from a CIA plot. He returns to England in the late 1960s and is installed as Chancellor of a new university. During the ceremony he is pelted with red paint but immediately identifies with the demonstrators and becomes a <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> the counter-culture movement. He resigns the chancellorship after a year, to run a commune for dissident youth. By late 1969, he has been drawn into a more sinister cult, led by the young mystic Scorpio Murtlock, which gradually overwhelms his life and independence. He is last heard of late in 1971, when during a ritual dawn run through the woods he collapses and dies.|$|E
5|$|Standard Oil {{moved its}} {{headquarters}} to New York City at 26 Broadway, and Rockefeller became a <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> the city's business community. He bought a residence in 1884 on 54th Street near the mansions of other magnates such as William Henry Vanderbilt. Despite personal threats and constant pleas for charity, Rockefeller took the new elevated train to his downtown office daily. In 1887, Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission which was tasked with enforcing equal rates for all railroad freight, {{but by then}} Standard depended more on pipeline transport. More threatening to Standard's power was the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, originally used to control unions, but later central to {{the breakup of the}} Standard Oil trust. Ohio was especially vigorous in applying its state anti-trust laws, and finally forced a separation of Standard Oil of Ohio {{from the rest of the}} company in 1892, the first step in the dissolution of the trust.|$|E
5|$|Sue Elvie Bailey {{was born}} on August 26, 1903, in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, to Reverend Isaac and Susie (née Ford) Bailey. She {{attended}} primary school at Nannie Burroughs' School for Girls in Washington, D.C. In 1920, she graduated from the college preparatory school, Spelman Seminary (now Spelman College) in Atlanta, Georgia. She continued her education at Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio, graduating in 1926 with bachelor's degrees in music and liberal arts, making her the first black student to earn a music degree from Oberlin. While there, Bailey developed a friendship with Louise Thompson, who would become a <b>central</b> <b>figure</b> <b>in</b> the Harlem Renaissance movement, and encouraged Langston Hughes, inventor of jazz poetry, to read poetry there. She traveled with a quintet giving concerts in Cleveland, New York, and Philadelphia, as well as London and Paris.|$|E
