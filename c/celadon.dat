5|$|The {{array of}} {{different}} types and styles of ceramic found during the excavations of Gedi provide information about the city's trade ties through the origin of imported vessels and aid in dating the site through seriation. At Gedi, a chronology has been established for the appearance {{of many of the}} ceramics, which have been found in deposits up to five feet. The dated tomb with an inscription connecting it to AD 1399 has served as a datum point for dating the stratigraphic layers. <b>Celadon,</b> Islamic monochromes, and blue and white Chinese porcelain were found in levels above the tomb, which date to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Below the tomb, yellow and black Islamic wares were found down to the natural soil, while <b>celadon</b> was found in layers immediately below the tomb. The <b>celadon</b> below the tomb varied from the <b>celadon</b> found above the tomb, since carvings of lotus pedals were more common on the <b>celadon</b> in the lower layers. Given the date of the tomb, it was determined that the ceramics above the tomb dated to the fifteenth century, which helped extrapolate dates for the remaining stratigraphy.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourteenth}} century, <b>celadon</b> was a prized import in East Africa, which was {{initially}} {{obtained from the}} Ming Dynasty in exchange for ivory. However, knowledge of direct exchange with the Chinese is restricted to a single account of a Chinese fleet harbored off of Malindi and Mombasa between 1417 and 1419. The number of imports from China and elsewhere continued to increase throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, represented by {{a large number of}} black on yellow Islamic wares and <b>celadon.</b> Also during the fourteenth century, local wares began to diversify with Gedi's expanding economy. During {{the beginning and end of}} the fifteenth century, respectively, blue and white porcelain began to gradually replace <b>celadon</b> and monochrome Islamic wares completely replaced black on yellow types. During the same century, local wares began to change with the reduction in the number of incised ornamental patterns and a shift to long necked-pots, compared to earlier short-necked variants. In the following century, blue and white porcelain and monochrome Islamic wares became the dominant imports; a trend that began to emerge in the previous century and would continue until Gedi's decline in the seventeenth century.|$|E
50|$|The museum's {{collection}} has about 30,000 pieces of Goryeo <b>celadons</b> and actively holds exhibitions for informing the people about Korean <b>Celadons</b> and its props. Some of kilns were reconstructed to reenact {{the way people}} of Goryeo made the <b>celadons.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Van Tilburg Collection {{contains}} a representative collection of Song wares: many <b>Celadons,</b> a few Ding wares, nine Cizhou wares {{and a few}} Junyao wares. <b>Celadons</b> are characterised by the semi-translucent green glaze, which varies in colour from a pale grey-green to a deep olive-green. Junyao wares are unmistakable due to their blue, purple and crimson colours. There are seven Junyao items in the collection.|$|R
5|$|Celadon: Named after a pale-tinted spring green colour, Chinese {{archaeologist}} Wang Zhongshu (1982) {{asserts that}} shards having {{this type of}} ceramic glaze have been recovered from Eastern Han Dynasty (25–220 AD) tomb excavations in Zhejiang; he also asserts {{that this type of}} ceramic became well known during the Three Kingdoms (220–265). Richard Dewar (2002) disagrees with Wang's classification, stating that true celadon—which requires a minimum 1260°C (2300°F) furnace temperature, a preferred range of 1285° to 1305°C (2345° to 2381°F), and reduced firing—was not created until the beginning of the Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127). The unique grey or green <b>celadon</b> glaze is a result of iron oxide's transformation from ferric to ferrous iron (Fe2O3 → FeO) during the firing process. Longquan <b>celadon</b> wares, which Nigel Wood (1999) writes were first made during the Northern Song, had bluish, blue-green, and olive green glazes and high silica and alkali contents which resembled later porcelain wares made at Jingdezhen and Dehua rather than stonewares.|$|E
5|$|Structured as {{a trailer}} for a {{non-existent}} film, Pokémon Apokélypse {{is set in}} the fictional <b>Celadon</b> City, and takes place several years after the events of the original anime series. The plot focuses on Ash Ketchum (Lee Majdoub), a Pokémon Trainer who commands creatures called Pokémon to battle other Trainers' Pokémon to advance within a league setting. Formerly a global sport, it was long since outlawed due to outcries of animal abuse, and instead continued in underground arenas, where the fighting became much more brutal. Despite warnings by his friend Brock (Kial Natale), Ash takes part in the battles with his Pokémon, Pikachu. When approached by Giovanni (David Quast), the head of Rocket Industries, with a bribe to throw his next fight, Ash turns the offer down. In response, Giovanni threatens Ash's former mentor Professor Oak (Richard Toews) and girlfriend, Misty (Rebecca Strom). Deciding to keep them safe, Ash accepts the bribe, and Pikachu is nearly killed in the match.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavations}} led to antiquities of Roman origin such as {{beads and}} gems, amphorae (wine making vats) with remnants of wine, a Roman stamp, big bricks recovered {{from an old}} wall, Arretine ware and so forth. From these antiquities Wheeler concluded that the site was related to a period of trading with Rome, {{and that it was}} first established by emperor Augustus. He also noted that this Indo-Roman trade lasted for a period of about 200 years, till 200 CE. Wheeler also found the Chinese <b>celadon,</b> identified to belong to the Song-Yuan dynasty, and Chola coins from about the eleventh century, but these were rejected as despoiling items or remnants left by brick-robbers. Items Chinese blue-and-white ware were also recovered from the site.|$|E

50|$|The museum owns {{more than}} 10,000 pieces of Korean art {{including}} more than 3,000 earthenwares, 2,100 porcelains, 1,100 <b>celadons,</b> 500 buncheongs, 2,000 paintings, 400 pieces of metal arts amongst many other items.|$|R
5|$|Ceramic {{that were}} {{imported}} to Gedi represent either {{direct or indirect}} trade with China, South Asia, and the Islamic world. Islamic pottery found at Gedi was wheel spun, glazed, and kiln fired, which includes sgraffiato, Yemeni black on yellow ceramics, and figured wares frequently depicting floral designs on blue and white panels. Sgraffiato is red-bodied earthenware with yellow or green glaze that was common in modern-day Iraq from the ninth to the sixteenth century. A type of polychrome stoneware from the sixteenth century characterized by grey, green, and brown glazes may {{have been made in}} Persia or India as an attempted imitation of Chinese porcelain. Another type of partially grey glazed bowls with circular decorations on their interior is believed to come from Indochina since the disappearance of the style coincides with the Thai conquest of the region in AD 1467. Various types of Chinese pottery also appear at Gedi, including <b>celadon</b> and blue and white porcelain, which were found in large enough volumes to assume that {{a significant portion of the}} population had access to higher quality wares, while sherds were also found inlayed in the mosques.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of the tea ceremony among the ruling class had a significant influence on ceramic production. To satisfy the demand for high quality pottery items necessary to the tea ceremony {{a large number of}} <b>celadon</b> vases and tenmoku ash-glazed teabowls initially were imported from China from the mid-11th to the 16th centuries. These imported items were copied and produced locally at the Seto kiln in Owari Province. Around the mid-16th century adjacent Mino took over as a production center of conservative Chinese inspired Seto style pottery. The Japanese invasions of Korea from 1592–1598, and subsequent relocation of Korean potters to Kyushu, brought new pottery styles to Japan. From the late-16th century, Mino potters developed new, distinctly Japanese techniques such as Shino ware or Raku ware. This was also motivated by a general shift of tastes among teamasters and others, who came to prefer simpler unglazed tea bowls formed by hand rather than on a pottery wheel. Of the 14 pottery items in this list, eight entries are chawan bowls used in the tea ceremony, three are flower vases, one is an incense burner, one a tea-leaf jar and one a funerary pot. Eight objects originated in China, five in Japan and one in Korea.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the Northern Song in 1125, the {{remainder}} of the Imperial court fled south, and the capital of the Southern Song was set up at Hangzhou. The nearby Longquan <b>celadon</b> kilns became the main producer of <b>celadon</b> and Yaozhou and the other Northern Celadons declined accordingly, in both quantity and quality, although celadons continued to be produced at Yaozhou until the Yuan dynasty.|$|E
50|$|The term {{may have}} become used very loosely by the Ming period, for all {{southern}} <b>celadons</b> with a pronounced crackle, and such usage continued in the West, though in recent decades it is discouraged.|$|R
50|$|Chinese greenwares {{were very}} popular imports to Korea, and {{inspired}} local potters. Exceptional high-quality <b>celadons</b> were produced in Korea during the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties. An inlaid greenware technique known as sanggam, where potters would engrave semi-dried pottery with designs and place {{black or white}} clay materials within the engraving, was invented in Korea during this time.|$|R

5000|$|The wares {{covered by}} the term have been {{gradually}} reduced; initially used {{for a wide range}} of early <b>celadons</b> with a grey body, it was first made more specific to refer only to wares from north China, and then later only to those from the Tang dynasty onwards, and sometimes to restrict it [...] "to the finest quality wares of the ninth and tenth centuries".|$|R

5000|$|Wares {{fired in}} mantou kilns include Ding ware, Yaozhou ware and other Northern <b>Celadons,</b> Jun, Ru, and Cizhou wares. The zhenyao [...] "egg-shaped kiln", {{developed}} for Jingdezhen ware {{in the late}} Ming dynasty, {{is in some ways}} a compromise between mantou and dragon kilns, like a stretched mantou kiln. Official Guan ware had been made at Jingdezhen in a northern-style mantou kiln, rare this far south.|$|R
2500|$|In {{traditional}} Western terms, most <b>celadons</b> {{are strictly}} counted as stoneware, since the fired clay body is usually neither white nor translucent. In the traditional Chinese classification, which divides pottery into low-fired earthenware and high-fired porcelain, they count as porcelain. Compromise {{terms such as}} [...] "porcellanous stoneware" [...] {{may be used to}} describe the pieces, and some Western writers consider the wares should be [...] "regarded as porcelains".|$|R
5000|$|The wares are {{stoneware}} {{in terms}} of Western classification, and [...] "high-fired" [...] or porcelain in Chinese terms (where the class of stoneware is not generally recognised). Like the still more prestigious Ru ware, they are often not quite fired {{as high as the}} normal stoneware temperature range, and the body remains permeable to water. [...] They form a [...] "close relative" [...] of the wider group of Northern <b>celadons</b> or greenwares.|$|R
25|$|During this period, {{laws were}} codified and a civil service system was introduced. Buddhism flourished and spread {{throughout}} the peninsula. The development of <b>celadon</b> pottery flourished in the 12th and 13th centuries.

25|$|In {{southern}} Kyūshū, kamuiyaki were excavated from sites {{near the}} month of the Manose River, Minamisatsuma, Kagoshima Prefecture. The Mottaimatsu Site, which was at its peak from the middle 12th century to {{the first half of}} the 13th century, had a huge variety of goods including kamuiyaki, a large number of Chinese ceramics such as Longquan <b>celadon</b> and Tong'an <b>celadon,</b> and in smaller quantity, sue wares from eastern Harima Province and Tokoname-yaki from Owari Province. Kamuiyaki were also found at the neighboring Wataribata and Shibahara Sites, and at the Kozono Site in the interior. Archaeologist Miyashita Takahiro argued that the Manose River basin had served as a trade center connected to Hakata–Dazaifu of northern Kyūshū. The presence of kamuiyaki suggests that this region was involved in the trade with the Southern Islands although excavated wares were slightly newer (around the 13th century) than archaeologists expected them to be.|$|E

5000|$|Chinese {{porcelain}} of the 14th or 15th {{century was}} {{transmitted to the}} Middle East and the Near East, and especially to the Ottoman Empire either through gifts or through war booty. Chinese designs were extremely influential with the pottery manufacturers at Iznik, Turkey. The Ming [...] "grape" [...] design in particular was highly popular and was extensively reproduced under the Ottoman Empire. The style of Persian pottery known as Kubachi ware also absorbed influence from China, imitating both <b>celadons</b> and Ming blue-and-white porcelain.|$|R
50|$|Korean ceramic history {{begins with}} the oldest {{earthenware}} dating to around 8000 BC. Influenced by Chinese ceramics, Korean pottery developed a distinct style of its own, with its own shapes, such as the moon jar or maebyeong version of the Chinese meiping vase, and later styles of painted decoration. Korean ceramic trends had an influence on Japanese ceramic culture. Examples of classic Korean wares are the <b>celadons</b> of the Goryeo dynasty (918 - 1392) and the white porcelains of the Joseon dynasty (1392 - 1897).|$|R
