The strands pass to a {{finishing}} area, where a lubricant, which may be a soap or silicone or other agent depending on the future use of the fibre, is applied. This step is basically a detangler, prior to carding and spinning into yarn. The dried, finished fibres are {{at this stage in}} a form called tow, a large untwisted bundle of continuous lengths of filament. The bundles of tow are taken to a crimper, a machine that compresses the fibre, giving it texture and bulk. The <b>crimped</b> <b>fibre</b> is carded by mechanical carders, which perform an action like combing, to separate and order the strands. The carded strands are cut and baled for shipment to a fabric mill. The entire manufacturing process, from unrolling the raw cellulose to baling the fibre, takes about two hours. After this, the Lyocell may be processed in many ways. It may be spun with another fibre, such as cotton or wool. The resulting yarn can be woven or knitted like any other fabric, and may be given a variety of finishes, from soft and suede-like to silky.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the mathematics and modelling of the industrial crimper, {{perhaps one of the}} least well understood processes that occurs in the manufacture of artificial fibre. We begin by modelling the process by which the fibre is deformed as it is forced into the industrial crimper. This we investigate by presuming the fibre to behave as an ideal elastica confined in a two dimensional channel. We consider how the arrangement of the fibre changes as more fibre is introduced, and the forces that are required to confine it. Later, we apply the same methods to a fibre confined to a three dimensional channel. After the fibre has under gone a preliminary deformation, a second process known as secondary crimp can occur. This involves the `zig-zagged' material folding over. We model this process in two ways. First as a series of rigid rods joined by elastic hinges, and then as an elastic with a highly oscillatory natural configuration compressed by thrusts at each end. We observe that both models can be expressed in a very similar manner, and both predict that a buckle can occur from a nearly straight initial condition to an arched formation. We also compare the results to experiments performed on the <b>crimped</b> <b>fibre.</b> Throughout much of the process, the configuration of the fibre does not alter. This part of the process we call the block, and model the material in this region in two ways: as a series of springs; and as an isotropic elastic material. We discuss the coupling between the different regions and the process that occurs in the block, and consider both the steady state and stability of the system...|$|E

A recently proposed limit-analysis model for {{the description of the}} ultimate behaviour of thin-webbed RC and prestressed concrete (PC) beams subjected to shear is extended here {{to the study of the}} role of fibres. A stabilized shear-crack pattern is assumed, with the stirrups at or beyond the yielding threshold, and the end sections of the concrete struts at the onset of failure in shear compression. The shear cracks, either limited to the web (PC beams) or extended to the lower flange (RC beams), are modelled with non-uniform opening and slip distributions, with mode 1 prevailing at the crack tip and mixed mode along the cracks. The fibres are introduced as fully kinked, randomly oriented, randomly embedded, linear connectors across the shear cracks, and their contribution to shear resistance is analysed in three different types of <b>fibres</b> (<b>crimped</b> and hooked-end or smooth steel fibres, and polyacrylonitrilic (PAN) fibres), different fibre contents, normal and high-strength concretes.

40|$|Collagen fibres in tendons and ligaments run {{straight}} but in {{some regions}} they show crimps which disappear or appear more flattened during the initial elongation of tissues. Each crimp is formed of collagen fibrils showing knots or fibrillar crimps at the crimp top angle. The present study analyzes by polarized light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy the 3 D morphology of fibrillar crimp in tendons and ligaments of rat demonstrating that each fibril in the fibrillar region always twists leftwards changing the plane of running and sharply bends modifying the course on a new plane. The morphology of fibrillar crimp in stretched tendons fulfills the mechanical role of the fibrillar crimp acting as a particular knot/biological hinge in absorbing tension forces during fibril strengthening and recoiling collagen fibres when stretching is removed. The left-handed path of fibrils in the fibrillar crimp region gives rise to left-handed fibril helices observed both in isolated fibrils and sections of different tendons and ligaments (flexor digitorum profundus muscle tendon, Achilles tendon, tail tendon, patellar ligament and medial collateral ligament of the knee). The left-handed path of fibrils represents a new final suprafibrillar level of the alternating handedness which was previously described only from the molecular to the microfibrillar level. When {{the width of the}} twisting angle in the fibrillar crimp is nearly 180 ° the fibrils appear as left-handed flattened helices forming <b>crimped</b> collagen <b>fibres</b> previously described as planar crimps.

In the present study, {{the effect of adding}} <b>crimped</b> polypropylene <b>fibres</b> on the improvement in the compressive properties of hardened concrete was studied. <b>Crimped</b> polypropylene <b>fibres</b> with different levels of reinforcements index was investigated systematically with designed concrete mixtures consisting of various fibres dosages of 0. 1 to 0. 5 % by volume of concrete. The effect of crimped profile of polypropylene fibres on the improvement in failure properties of concrete in compression and flexural tension were evaluated. Test results showed that polypropylene fibres showed higher fracture energy absorption and exhibited a marginal improvement in strength index and sudden failure is prevented resulting in multiple splitting cracks. The ultrasonic pulse velocity test results were also found to be consistent and exhibited a good integrity for all CPFRC concrete specimens.

The major weaknesses of concrete are its brittleness and poor resistance to tensile forces. Intensive number of studies has been conducted to add various types of short discrete fibres into concrete mix to enhance its ductility and post-peak load-bearing capacity. A spiral-shaped steel fibre was recently proposed for reinforcing concrete material with 3 D bond components. A series of laboratory tests have been conducted for a comprehensive investigation of the performances of spiral-shaped steel fibre reinforced concrete materials and structures. A fundamental understanding of the bond-slip behaviour of spiral fibres and its mechanism of reinforcing the matrix was achieved by conducting pull-out tests. Compressive and direct tensile tests on Ø 100 - 200 mm concrete specimens with spiral fibres of different geometries were conducted for properly determining fibre geometries to reinforce concrete materials. Split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) tests were carried out to study the dynamic behaviour of spiral steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) with various volume fractions under compression and splitting tension. The corresponding relations of dynamic increase factor (DIF) vs. strain rate were proposed based on test data. Repeated drop-weight impact tests on SFRC beams reinforced with the commonly-used hook-end fibres and spiral fibres were performed. Test results demonstrated the superiority of spiral fibres in bonding and enhancing concrete structural elements in resisting impact loads. The even distributions of spiral fibres in comparison with <b>crimped</b> <b>fibres</b> in concrete matrix were justified by physical examinations. Mesoscale simulations with distinctive consideration of mortar matrix, coarse aggregates and spiral fibres were conducted for statistical derivation of dynamic properties of spiral SFRC.

40|$|Crimp, a {{distinguishing}} feature of sheep fibres, significantly affects wool value, processing and final fabric attributes. Several explanations for fibre bending have been proposed. Most concentrate on relative {{differences in the}} physicochemical properties of the cortical cells, which comprise {{the bulk of the}} fibre. However, the associations between cortical properties and <b>fibre</b> <b>crimp</b> are not consistent and may not reflect the underlying causation of fibre curvature (FC). We have formulated a mechanistic model in which fibre shape is dictated primarily by the degree of asymmetry in cell supply from the follicle bulb, and the point at which keratinisation is completed within the follicle. If this hypothesis is correct, one would anticipate that most variations in <b>fibre</b> <b>crimp</b> would be accounted for by quantitative differences in both the degree of mitotic asymmetry in follicle bulbs and the distance from the bulb to the point at which keratinisation is completed. To test this hypothesis, we took skin biopsies from Merino sheep from sites producing wool differing widely in <b>fibre</b> <b>crimp</b> frequency and FC. Mitotic asymmetry in follicle bulbs was measured using a DNA-labelling technique and the site of final keratinisation was defined by picric acid staining of the fibre. The proportion of para- to ortho-cortical cell area was determined in the cross-sections of fibres within biopsy samples. Mitotic asymmetry in the follicle bulb accounted for 0. 64 (P < 0. 0001) of the total variance in objectively measured FC, while the point of final keratinisation of the fibre accounted for an additional 0. 05 (P < 0. 05) of the variance. There was no association between ortho- to para-cortical cell ratio and FC. FC was positively associated with a subjective follicle curvature score (P < 0. 01). We conclude that <b>fibre</b> <b>crimp</b> is caused predominantly by asymmetric cell division in follicles that are highly curved. Differential pressures exerted by the subsequent asymmetric cell supply and cell hardening in the lower follicle cause fibre bending. The extent of bending is then modulated by the point at which keratinisation is completed; later hardening means the fibre remains pliable for longer, thereby reducing the pressure differential and reducing fibre bending. This means that even highly asymmetric follicles may produce a straight fibre if keratinisation is sufficiently delayed, {{as is the case in}} deficiencies of zinc and copper, or when keratinisation is perturbed by transgenesis. The model presented here can account for the many variations in fibre shape found in mammals. P. I. Hynd, N. M. Edwards, M. Hebart, M. McDowall and S. Clar...|$|R

Tensile {{studies in the}} 01 fibre direction are performed on unidirectional and quasi-isotropic laminates reinforced with different volume contents and sizes of fibrous composite z-pins. Microstructural analysis reveals that z-pinning causes several types of damage, including out-of-plane <b>fibre</b> <b>crimping,</b> in-plane <b>fibre</b> distortion, mild dilution of the in-plane fibre volume fraction due to laminate swelling, and clusters of broken fibres, In unidirectional composites, resin pockets form around pins and coalesce into continuous resin channels at higher z-pin contents. Young&# 039;s modulus falls only a few percent at most, due partly to in-plane fibre dilution and partly to fibre waviness. Monotonic tensile strength is degraded more significantly, falling linearly with both pin content and pin diameter. Comparison with prior data shows {{that the rate of}} degradation is evidently a strong function of the particular pin insertion method used. Failure mechanisms include fibre rupture, presumably affected by broken fibres, and, in unidirectional laminates, longitudinal splitting cracks emanating from resin pockets. Whereas non-pinned laminates show very modest fatigue effects, the pinned laminates exhibit strong fatigue effects, with strength falling by as much as 33 % at 10 (6) cycles. The slope of the fatigue life (S-N) curve tends to increase in magnitude with pin content and density. Limited evidence and prior literature suggest that the dominant fatigue mechanism may be progressive softening and fibre damage in misaligned segments of in-plane fibres...|$|R

Part of this goal can be achieved {{with the use of}} new types of composite materials, such as non-crimp fabric composites. These new composites, still under development, are made from dry fabrics and combine in theory the excellent in-plane behaviour of the unidirectional pre-impregnated tape composites with better out-of-plane behaviour and lower cost of the woven fabric composites. In practice, however, due to several parameters associated with the different stages of manufacturing of the non-crimp fabric laminates, some in-plane and out-of-plane waviness at the mesoscopic scale is introduced. This waviness (typically called crimp) is responsible for lowering the in-plane behaviour and causing specific failure models.

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} (RC) pipes {{are widely}} used as open channels (non-pressurized pipes) for sewage and storm water conveyance. RC pipes have generally achieved a reliable long-term performance. Depending on multiple parameters (e. g. pipe diameter, pipe wall thickness, required strength, etc.) the pipe may have up to three welded reinforcement cages in order to resist anticipated loads. Each cage is an assembled unit of steel reinforcement consisting of circumferential and longitudinal bars or wires. The fabrication process of a steel cage reinforcement is time and labour consuming. Thus, eliminating the steel cage reinforcement will yield an overall reduction in the production cost of precast concrete pipes. Dispersed steel fibres {{can be an effective}} alternative for the reinforcement of concrete pipes. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore using steel fibres as reinforcement in dry-cast concrete pipes. Mechanical properties of dry-cast steel-fibre reinforced concrete (DCSFRC) fabricated using multiple steel fibre types at various dosages were characterized. Consequently, precast pipes reinforced with Dramix RC- 65 / 35 -CN and Dramix RC- 80 / 60 -CN fibres at various dosages were fabricated. An extensive experimental program was carried out in order to evaluate the structural performance of the full-scale steel fibre-reinforced concrete (SFRC) pipes that were produced in comparison to plain concrete (PC) and RC pipes. Precast pipes had internal diameters of 300, 450, and 600 mm as well as a Type C wall thickness. The structural performance of pipes was characterized using both the continuous and cyclic three-edge-bearing tests (TEBT). Furthermore, the soil-pipe interaction of buried full-scale SFRC pipes was investigated. Finally, a three dimensional non-linear finite element model of the TEBT of SFRC pipes was developed. Subsequently, a parametric study covering multiple pipe configuration and reinforcement parameters was conducted. Results showed that hooked-end fibres with the largest fibre aspect ratio (Dramix RC- 80 / 60 -CN) induced the best flexural performance of DCSFRC specimens while <b>crimped</b> <b>fibres</b> (Novocon XR) were the least effective in enhancing the flexural strength and post-peak behaviour of DCSFRC. The load carrying capacity of SFRC pipes increased with increased fibre dosage. Results of the TEBT for 300 mm diameter pipes showed that the reinforcement specified for Class V pipes in ASTM C 76 “Standard Specification For Reinforced Concrete Culvert, Storm Drain, And Sewer Pipe” could be achieved using a steel fibre dosage of 20 kg/m³, while a fibre dosage of 30 kg/m³ was sufficient for 450 and 600 mm diameter pipes to satisfy the same strength class (Class V). Furthermore, provided using a sufficient fibre dosage, SFRC pipes exhibited higher residual strengths and less deformations than that of RC pipes when subjected to small to moderate loading levels. In addition, results showed that using a hybrid system of short (Dramix RC- 65 / 35 -CN) and long (Dramix RC- 80 / 60 -CN) fibres did not result in synergetic effects. Full-scale testing results of buried SFRC pipes indicated that the pipes could sustain live loads consisting of a fully loaded 625 CL Standard Ontario Truck without exhibiting any cracks or significant deformations, even when the pipe was installed in the least quality installation type (Type IV). This indicated that the current design recommendations for the pipe wall thickness in ASTM C 76 (Type C wall) are overly conservative. Furthermore, it was found that the post-cracking behaviour of buried SFRC pipes was more sensitive to the installation type than to the type of steel fibre reinforcement. Finally, the findings of the parametric study were presented in a tabular form that can be used as a design aid supplementary to the newly released ASTM C 1765 “Standard Specification for Steel Fiber Reinforced Concrete Culvert, Storm Drain, and Sewer Pipe”. The experimental findings of this study should assist the precast concrete industry in producing more economical SFRC pipe without the need for costly and time consuming welded steel cage reinforcement.

There was a smaller dataset that contained also lamb live weight, greasy fleece weight and additional fleece characteristics including fibre diameter measured with the OFDA method.

Selective breeding {{is a means of}} improving raw wool clean colour, but its effectiveness is currently unclear due to limited existing information on clean colour variability, heritability and correlations with other fleece traits. Clean colour was measured on yearling (10 mths, n= 7106) and adult (21 mths, n= 8078) animals. Other fleece traits, including assessed greasy wool colour, were also recorded and genetic parameters for clean and greasy wool colour estimated. Clean wool colour was moderately to highly heritable at both yearling and adult ages (0. 25 and 0. 29 respectively), as was greasy colour (0. 33 and 0. 40). Clean wool colour at yearling and adult age was moderately genetically correlated (0. 52), suggesting that selection using yearling measurements would be effective for improving lifetime clean wool colour. Greasy and clean wool colour were poorly correlated phenotypically and genetically at both yearling and adult age. Of the measured fleece traits, fibre diameter and curvature were those with highest genetic correlations with clean wool colour (yearling, 0. 52,- 0. 34). These correlations indicate that superfine wool animals with a classical <b>crimp</b> frequency to <b>fibre</b> diameter ratio (true-to-type) tend to have superior clean wool colour compared to other wool types included here...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Three-dimensional woven composites were developed to improve the through-thickness properties which conventional two-dimensional laminate composites currently lack. However, these textile composites generally show lower in-plane mechanical properties due to <b>fibre</b> <b>crimping,</b> and also encounter modelling difficulties due to the complex geometries. In this thesis, the static and fatigue mechanical behaviour of several types of 3 D woven composites were experimentally characterised, {{the influence of the}} weave architecture on the mechanical performance was revealed, and meso/macro scale numerical models with improved failure criteria were developed to simulate the tensile behaviour of the 3 D woven composites. The mechanical characterisation was conducted on six woven structures under tension, compression, and flexural loading, and were also carried out on two weaves under open-hole quasi-static tensile and fatigue loading. Digital image correlation and thermoelastic stress analysis were used to characterise the strain and damage development during static and fatigue loading. The testing results showed that the angle-interlock weave W- 3 had higher in-plane quasi-static properties, lower notch sensitivity, higher fatigue damage resistance, but lower delamination resistance. The meso-scale model was developed on the unit cell of the woven structure and the macro-scale model (mosaic model) was created on the testing samples. Both un-notched and notched tensile behaviour were modelled for the angle-interlock weave W- 3 and a one-by-one orthogonal weave W- 1, and the difference between the predicted and experimental results was within 16...|$|R
40|$|Felting is {{a unique}} {{attribute}} of animal fibres used {{for the production of}} a range of industrial and apparel textiles. Felting can be an adverse attribute as a consequence of dimensional shrinkage during laundering. As there is little objective information regarding the feltability of rare animal fibres or the factors which may affect felting three investigations were undertaken. A survey (n = 114) of the feltability of cashmere from different origins of production, cashgora, quivet, camel hair, llama, guanaco, bison wool, cow fibre and yak wool quantified the large variation between and within these fibre types. Cashmere from some origins and cashgora produced higher feltball density than the other fibres. Different nutritional management of cashmere goats (n = 35) showed that cashmere grown by poorly fed goats had a lower propensity to felt compared with cashmere grown by better fed goats. A consequence of the progressive blending of cashmere (n = 27) with a low propensity to felt superfine wool (high fibre curvature) increased the propensity of the blend to felt, but when the same cashmere was blended with low curvature superfine wool, there was little or no effect on feltability. The mechanisms which lead to variance in feltability of these fibres were quantified with multiple regression modelling. The mechanisms were similar to those reported for wools, namely variations in the resistance to compression, fibre curvature and mean fibre diameter, with likely effects of <b>fibre</b> <b>crimp</b> form. It is possible to source cashmere and other animal fibres which have different propensities to felt and therefore to produce textiles which are likely to have different textile properties. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The {{economically}} important {{characteristics of}} the adult fleece of Merino sheep, such as increases in clean fleece weight, fibre length, <b>fibre</b> diameter and <b>crimp</b> characteristics are determined during critical phases of fetal development of the skin and its appendages. Genetics {{plays a major role}} in the development of traits, but the maternal uterine environment could also influence development. Treatment of pregnant ewes with cortisol and its analogues has previously been shown to produce changes in wool follicle morphology. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of transient manipulation of maternal cortisol status during critical phases of wool follicle initiation and development in utero. From Days 55 – 65 post-conception, singleton-bearing Merino ewes were treated with metyrapone (cortisol inhibitor) or betamethasone (cortisol analogue). Lambs exposed to metyrapone in utero were born with hairier birthcoats than the control or betamethasone treatment groups (P < 0. 05), displayed a 10 % increase in staple length and a reduction in crimp frequency for the first three shearings (P < 0. 05). Co-expression network analysis of microarray data revealed up-regulation of members of the transforming growth factor-β and chemokine receptor superfamilies, gene families known to influence hair and skin development. These experiments demonstrate that presumptive transient manipulation of maternal cortisol status coinciding with the initiation of fetal wool follicle development results in long-term alteration in fleece characteristics, namely fibre length and <b>fibre</b> <b>crimp</b> frequency. These results indicate it is possible to alter the lifetime wool production of Merino sheep with therapeutics targeted to gene expression during key windows of development in utero. M. L.

40|$|Summary. -The topical {{carcinogenicity}} to mouse skin {{of smoke}} condensates ob-tained from a tobacco substitute (NSM), {{alone or in}} combination with tobacco, has been compared with condensate from tobacco and with acetone, the solvent used. Sixteen different types of cigarette were {{used to make the}} condensates, and the age-standardized results have been analysed according to the Weibull distribution model. The results show that NSM condensate has less than 25 % of the potency of tobacco condensate (37 0 at 95 0 upper confidence limit), and that condensates from blends of NSM and tobacco are similarly reduced in activity. General pathology analysis failed to reveal abnormalities due to NSM. THE chemical complexity of cigarette smoke precludes the precise attribution of the known carcinogenic effects to a single component or group of components, and animal models are therefore required to assay carcinogenic activity. A model commonly used is the topical application of smoke condensates to mouse skin, and measurement of the incidence of tumours which result. The method has been much used to monitor attempts at reduction of the carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke, and although there is as yet no evidence equating mouse skin response with the human lung response, it is assumed that a direct relationship exists between the ability to induce tumours in mouse skin and in the human bronchial tract. The experiments described were de-signed to determine the carcinogenic potential of smoke condensate from a substitute smoking material and from blends of this material with conventional tobacco.

Zaradi visoke orientacije in kristalinosti vlaken kažejo liocel vlakna močno težnjo k fibriliranju, t. j. cepljenju fibrilov vzdolž vlaken. Nabrekanje in mehanske obremenitve ta pojav pospešijo in ojačajo. Zelo tanki fibrili na površini vlaken in njihovo kodranje povzročijo povečano površino vlaken in s tem spremembo površine tkanin. Metoda, ki so trenutno na razpolago za ocenitev stopnje fibriliranja so še nepopolne. Spremembo površine vlakna kot funkcijo fibriliranja lahko zaznamo optično ali po spremembah otipa. V prispevku smo predstavili novo metodo zasledovanja fibriliranja s spremembo optičnih lastnosti tkanin, in sicer Tencel vlaken. Z obdelavo in kvantitativno analizo mikroskopskih slik smo določali spremembe oblike in velikosti por v tkanini, ki so nastale kot posledica različnih postopkov obdelane, n. pr. fibriliranje surove tkanine, encimatska obdelava in zamreženje liocel vlaken. The {{differences}} in the man-made cellulose fibre forming processes produce some varieties in the morphological structure of fibres, which shows in fibres 2 ̆ 7 different tendency to fibrillate, i. e. to split along the fibre axis. The basic parameters connected with {{the high degree of}} crystallinity and orientation of lyocell fibres are also the reason for lyocell fibres 2 ̆ 7 high tendency to fibrillate. Fibre swelling and mechanical stress promote this effect. Very fine fibrils on the fibre surface and their <b>crimping</b> increase the <b>fibre</b> surface and thereby influence the surface changes of the fabric. Some methods for following the formation of fibrils, their density and homogeneity have been proposed, but have proved to be insufficient. The changes of the fibre surface due to fibrillation can be followed optically or by handle changes. In the paper a new method for observing the changes of optical properties of lyocell fibres influenced by fibre fibrillation is given. The analyses were performed on Tencel fabrics. Processing and quantitative analysis of microscopic images was involved for studying the form and dimensions of fabric pores that were produced by different treatments, like raw fabric fibrillation, enzyme treatment and crosslinking of lyocell fibres...|$|R
40|$|Yarn {{hairiness}} affects {{not only}} the quality of products, but also the productivity in spinning and weaving. Too much yarn hairiness is undesirable for many end uses {{as well as the}} spinning and post spinning processes. The main aims of this project are to examine the hairiness features of various yarns and to reduce yarn hairiness. The thesis covers five related areas – hairiness assessment, factors affecting yarn hairiness, the hairiness of newly developed yarns, yarn hairiness reduction, and effect of yarn hairiness on the energy consumption in ring spinning. The worsted cashmere, pure wool and wool/cashmere blend yarns were employed to investigate the effect of some fibre parameters on the yarn hairiness. A single exponential distribution of the hair-length was confirmed first, using the data from the Zweigle G 565 Hairiness Meter. A linear relationship was observed between the blend ratio and the hairiness indexes. In particular, the effect of <b>fibre</b> <b>crimp</b> or curvature on yarn hairiness is examined. The theory of yarn hairiness composition was also developed further. The effect of draft ratio and spindle speed on the hairiness of worsted wool yarn was examined next with a factorial experiment design. Several new hairiness indexes, namely the relative hairiness indexes, have been used to explain the results obtained. In the investigation of the hairiness of newly developed yarns, the hairiness of the Compact Spun and Roller-Jet-Spun yarns was examined first. The composition of the yarn hairiness, the hair-length distribution, and the effect of test speed on yarn hairiness were then studied. An important finding is that for both yarns, the predominant hairiness feature is the looped hairs. A comparison of the hairiness of Solospun yarns and the equivalent ring spun wool yarns was undertaken. The hair-length distribution of the Solospun yarn was examined first. The Solospun yarns used had fewer hairs in most hair-length groups and lower variations in hairiness. In addition, the effect of twist level and spindle speed on the hairiness of Solospun and conventional ring spun yarns has also been discussed. A novel approach of reducing yarn hairiness – spinning with a ‘Diagonal’ yarn path was examined next. Both ‘Left Diagonal’ and ‘Right Diagonal’ yarn arrangements were studied. A new finding is that the ‘Right Diagonal’ yarn path leads to reduced hairiness for the Z-twist yarn, while yarn evenness and tenacity are not as sensitive to the modified yarn path. The mechanism of hairiness reduction with the ‘Diagonal’ yarn path has been discussed. The spinning performance of “Right Diagonal” yarn arrangement has also been evaluated. Finally, the effect of yarn hairiness on the energy consumption in ring spinning has been investigated theoretically and experimentally. A theoretical model has been developed, which represents the first attempt at theoretically investigating the influence of yarn hairiness on energy consumption during the winding stage of ring spinning. The experimental results have generally confirmed predictions of this model. Recommendations for further research in this area have also been made in the concluding chapter of this thesis...|$|R
