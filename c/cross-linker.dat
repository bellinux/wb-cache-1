25|$|Collagen {{is a major}} {{component}} of the extracellular matrix, and it is found in the supporting tissues of peripheral nerves. A terpolymer (TERP) was synthesized by free radical copolymerization of its three monomers and cross-linked with collagen, creating a hybrid biological-synthetic hydrogel scaffold. The terpolymer is based on poly(NIPAAM), which is known to be a cell friendly polymer. TERP is used both as a <b>cross-linker</b> to increase hydrogel robustness and as a site for grafting of bioactive peptides or growth factors, by reacting some of its acryloxysuccinimide groups with the –NH2 groups on the peptides or growth factors. Because the collagen-terpolymer (collagen-TERP) hydrogel lacks a bioactive component, a study attached to it a common cell adhesion peptide found in laminin (YIGSR) in order to enhance its cell adhesion properties.|$|E
25|$|Polyacrylamide gel (PAG) {{had been}} known as a {{potential}} embedding medium for sectioning tissues as early as 1964, and two independent groups employed PAG in electrophoresis in 1959. It possesses several electrophoretically desirable features that make it a versatile medium. It is a synthetic, thermo-stable, transparent, strong, chemically relatively inert gel, and can be prepared {{with a wide range}} of average pore sizes. The pore size of a gel and the reproducibility in gel pore size are determined by three factors, the total amount of acrylamide present (%T) (T = Total concentration of acrylamide and bisacrylamide monomer), the amount of <b>cross-linker</b> (%C) (C = bisacrylamide concentration), and the time of polymerization of acrylamide (cf. QPNC-PAGE). Pore size decreases with increasing %T; with cross-linking, 5%C gives the smallest pore size. Any increase or decrease in %C from 5% increases the pore size, as pore size with respect to %C is a parabolic function with vertex as 5%C. This appears to be because of non-homogeneous bundling of polymer strands within the gel. This gel material can also withstand high voltage gradients, is amenable to various staining and destaining procedures, and can be digested to extract separated fractions or dried for autoradiography and permanent recording.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "gel" [...] in this {{instance}} refers to the matrix used to contain, then separate the target molecules. In most cases, the gel is a crosslinked polymer whose composition and porosity is chosen based on the specific weight and composition of the target to be analyzed. When separating proteins or small nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, or oligonucleotides) the gel is usually composed of different concentrations of acrylamide and a <b>cross-linker,</b> producing different sized mesh networks of polyacrylamide. When separating larger nucleic acids (greater than a few hundred bases), the preferred matrix is purified agarose. In both cases, the gel forms a solid, yet porous matrix. Acrylamide, in contrast to polyacrylamide, is a neurotoxin and must be handled using appropriate safety precautions to avoid poisoning. Agarose is composed of long unbranched chains of uncharged carbohydrate without cross links resulting in a gel with large pores allowing for the separation of macromolecules and macromolecular complexes.|$|E

In addition to Nafion®, polymers of 2 -acrylamido- 2 -methylpropane sulfonic acid (AMPS) have been used as a proton-conducting ionomer since sulfonic groups are known for their good proton conductivity.

5000|$|Condensation curing {{systems can}} be one-part or two-part systems. [...] In one-part or RTV (room-temperature vulcanizing) system, a <b>cross-linker</b> exposed to ambient {{humidity}} (i.e., water) experiences a hydrolysis step and is left with a hydroxyl or silanol group. The silanol condenses further with another hydrolyzable group on the polymer or <b>cross-linker</b> and continues until the system is fully cured. Such a system will cure on its own at room temperature and (unlike the platinum-based addition cure system) is not easily inhibited by contact with other chemicals, though the process may be affected by contact with some plastics or metals and may not take place at all if placed in contact with already-cured silicone compounds. The crosslinkers used in condensation cure systems are typically alkoxy, acetoxy or oxime silanes such as methyl trimethoxy silane for alkoxy-curing systems and methyl triacetoxysilane for acetoxy-curing systems. In many cases an additional condensation catalyst is added to fully cure the RTV system and achieve a tack-free surface. Organotitanate catalysts such as tetraalkoxy titanates or chelated titanates are used in alkoxy-cured systems. Tin catalysts such as dibutyl tin dilaurate (DBTDL) {{can be used in}} oxime and acetoxy-cured systems. Acetoxy tin condensation {{is one of the oldest}} cure chemistries used for curing silicone rubber, and is the one used in household bathroom caulk. The smell of vinegar in the form of acetic acid is the usual indicator that the curing reaction is taking place. Non-acid-producing formulations also exist which have a shorter shelf-life, however, and reduced adhesion when finally cured. [...] Two-part condensation systems package the <b>cross-linker</b> and condensation catalyst together in one part while the polymer and any fillers or pigments are in the second part.

We have combined Triton X- 100 extraction with lectin cytochemistry in the photoreceptor sensory cilium to investigate the relationship between cell surface glycoconjugates and the underlying cytoskeleton, and to identify the cell surface components involved. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) binds heavily to the cell surface in the region of the Y-shaped <b>cross-linkers</b> of the neonatal rat photoreceptor cilium. WGA binding is not removed by prior digestion with neuraminidase and succinyl-WGA also binds the proximal cilium, suggesting a predominance of N-acetylglucosamine containing glycoconjugates. Extraction of the photoreceptor plasma membrane with Triton X- 100 removes the lipid bilayer, leaving the Y- shaped crosslinkers associated with the axoneme. WGA-binding sites are found at the distal ends of the crosslinkers after Triton X- 100 extraction, indicating that the microtubule-membrane <b>cross-linkers</b> retain both a transmembrane and a cell surface component after removal of the lipid bilayer. To identify glycoconjugate components of the <b>cross-linkers</b> we used a subcellular fraction enriched in axonemes from adult bovine retinas.

Decorridas 24 h do tratamento com esses agentes e da cimentação de pinos de fibra de vidro com cimento resinoso, as raízes foram seccionadas transversalmente para a obtenção de espécimes com 1 mm de espessura, das regiões {{cervical}}, média e apical. Nove raízes por grupo foram utilizadas para o ensaio mecânico de extrusão e três para determinação da atividade proteolítica dentinária, por meio de zimografia in situ. Os dados de resistência de união (RU) foram submetidos aos testes de ANOVA e Tukey e a existência de associação entre o tipo de fratura e as variáveis independentes do estudo foi determinada pelo teste de qui-quadrado ( 2) (= 0, 05).

After 24 h from dentin treatment with the <b>cross-linkers</b> and the cementation of a fiber post with a resin-based cement, the roots were transversally sectioned to obtain 1 mm-thick specimens, from the cervical, mid and apical areas. Nine roots per group were used for the push-out test and three for determining the proteolytic activity of the root dentin by in situ zymography. Bond strength data were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey tests and the existence of an association between the type of fracture and the independent variables of the study was determined by chi-square test (= 0. 05). None of the <b>cross-linkers</b> affected the bond strength. GD increased bond strength compared to PA, but both were similar to the control. Significant reduction in bond strength was observed between the cervical and the apical root thirds. Increase in the percentage of adhesive fractures between the glass fiber post and resin cement was observed for EDC and GD groups, in comparison with the control group, while for PA, an increase of adhesive fractures between the resin cement and dentin was observed. Intense gelatinolytic activity was seen in the control group which was remarkably reduced in the cross-linker-treated groups.
