5000|$|In mid-1957 {{western powers}} {{began to worry}} that Syria was close to a {{communist}} takeover; it had a highly organized communist party and the newly appointed army's chief of staff, Afif al-Bizri, was a communist sympathizer. This caused the Syrian Crisis of 1957 after which Syrians intensified their efforts to unite with Egypt. [...] Nasser told a Syrian delegation, including President Shukri al-Quwatli and Prime Minister Khaled al-Azem, {{that they needed to}} rid their government of communists, but the delegation countered and warned him that only total union with Egypt would end the [...] "communist threat". According to Abdel Latif Boghdadi, Nasser initially resisted a total union with Syria, favoring instead a federal union. However, Nasser was [...] "more afraid of a Communist takeover" [...] and agreed on a total merger. The increasing strength of the Syrian Communist Party, under the leadership of Khalid Bakdash, worried the Syrian Ba'ath Party, which was suffering from an internal crisis from which prominent members were anxious to find an escape. Syria had had a democratic government since the overthrow of Adib al-Shishakli's military regime in 1954, and popular pressure for Arab unity was reflected in the <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliament.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Several {{authorities}} {{declared that}} the Crown {{had the power to}} add life peers to the House of Lords. Therefore, on the advice of her ministers, Queen Victoria created the Barony of Wensleydale, a life peerage, for Sir James Parke, a Baron of the Court of the Exchequer (baron, in this case, being a judicial, rather than a noble, title), in 1856. When Parliament met, Lord Wensleydale, being ill with gout, failed to present himself and take his seat. Thereafter, John Singleton Copley, 1st Baron Lyndhurst moved that the entire matter be referred to the Committee for Privileges. During the debates, it was pointed out that no case of a life peer sitting in the House of Lords had occurred for over four centuries [...] - [...] the question, then, was, whether or not the power of the Crown was lost with time. The ministers of the Crown pointed out the doctrine that the Royal prerogative was not fettered by the passage of time. On the other hand, it was pointed out that formerly, the Sovereign's power over the <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliament</b> was without limit: peers entitled to seats in Parliament were denied writs of summons; constituencies were enfranchised or disenfranchised in the House of Commons through the exercise of the Royal prerogative. That power, however, had been vitiated {{by the time of the}} Wensleydale case. Thus, it was submitted that the Crown could not change the constitutional character of Parliament alone; rather, an Act of Parliament, with the authority of the Sovereign and both Houses, was necessitated.|$|E
