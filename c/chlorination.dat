5|$|In 1845 German chemist Hermann Kolbe {{synthesised}} {{acetic acid}} from inorganic compounds {{for the first}} time. This reaction sequence consisted of <b>chlorination</b> of carbon disulfide to carbon tetrachloride, followed by pyrolysis to tetrachloroethylene and aqueous <b>chlorination</b> to trichloroacetic acid, and concluded with electrolytic reduction to acetic acid.|$|E
5|$|TcCl4 is {{obtained}} by <b>chlorination</b> of Tc metal or Tc2O7 Upon heating, TcCl4 gives the corresponding Tc(III) and Tc(II) chlorides.|$|E
5|$|The {{raw water}} intake (headworks) at Bull Run is just below Dam 2. This is where water is {{diverted}} {{from the river}} for <b>chlorination</b> and then routed into three distribution conduits for delivery to Portland. About 23percent of the watershed's annual runoff is diverted to the city's water supply.|$|E
5|$|Alkanes and aryl alkanes may be {{chlorinated}} under {{free radical}} conditions, with UV light. However, {{the extent of}} <b>chlorination</b> is difficult to control: the reaction is not regioselective and often results {{in a mixture of}} various isomers with different degrees of <b>chlorination,</b> though this may be permissible if the products are easily separated. Aryl chlorides may be prepared by the Friedel-Crafts halogenation, using chlorine and a Lewis acid catalyst. The haloform reaction, using chlorine and sodium hydroxide, is also able to generate alkyl halides from methyl ketones, and related compounds. Chlorine adds to the multiple bonds on alkenes and alkynes as well, giving di- or tetra-chloro compounds. However, due to the expense and reactivity of chlorine, organochlorine compounds are more commonly produced by using hydrogen chloride, or with chlorinating agents such as phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) or thionyl chloride (SOCl2). The last is very convenient in the laboratory because all side products are gaseous and {{do not have to be}} distilled out.|$|E
5|$|Bromine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between chlorine and iodine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. Bond energies to bromine tend to be lower than those to chlorine but higher than those to iodine, and bromine is a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine but a stronger one than iodine. This can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the X2/X− couples (F, +2.866V; Cl, +1.395V; Br, +1.087V; I, +0.615V; At, approximately +0.3V). Bromination often leads to higher oxidation states than iodination but lower or equal oxidation states to <b>chlorination.</b> Bromine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Br bonds.|$|E
5|$|From May to late August 1996 {{the park}} was closed for a $700,000 {{refurbishment}} that included repairs and upgrades to filters and pumps, automated <b>chlorination,</b> restoration of cement, and updating of the lighting system. The fountain was also shut down in 1997 and 1998 for 10 months while the water bureau replaced a 1930s-era pump. The piping was also relined with cross-linked polyethylene {{in the spring of}} spring 2000, a costly operation due to the original piping being cast into the concrete.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} carbon–halogen bonds, the C–Cl bond {{is a common}} {{functional}} group that forms part of core organic chemistry. Formally, compounds with this functional group may be considered organic derivatives of the chloride anion. Due to the difference of electronegativity between chlorine (3.16) and carbon (2.55), the carbon in a C–Cl bond is electron-deficient and thus electrophilic. <b>Chlorination</b> modifies the physical properties of hydrocarbons in several ways: chlorocarbons are typically denser than water due to the higher atomic weight of chlorine versus hydrogen, and aliphatic organochlorides are alkylating agents because chloride is a leaving group.|$|E
5|$|Many small {{communities}} obtain their drinking water from diverse sources (lakes, streams, springs and groundwater wells). Levels of treatment vary widely, from rudimentary systems with coarse screening or settling followed by disinfection (usually <b>chlorination),</b> to more sophisticated systems using a filtration step. It {{should be noted}} that unless a high quality source is used, such as secure groundwater, disinfection alone is unlikely to guarantee that drinking water is safe from protozoa such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium, which are relatively resistant to standard disinfectants and which require additional removal steps such as filtration.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between fluorine and bromine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. Chlorine is a weaker oxidising agent than fluorine but a stronger one than bromine or iodine. This can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the X2/X− couples (F, +2.866V; Cl, +1.395V; Br, +1.087V; I, +0.615V; At, approximately +0.3V). However, this trend is not shown in the bond energies because fluorine is singular due to its small size, low polarisability, and lack of low-lying d-orbitals available for bonding (which chlorine has). As another difference, chlorine has a significant chemistry in positive oxidation states while fluorine does not. <b>Chlorination</b> often leads to higher oxidation states than bromination or iodination but lower oxidation states to fluorination. Chlorine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Cl bonds.|$|E
5|$|Rhenium and {{technetium}} form a {{range of}} oxyhalides from the halogenation of the oxide. The <b>chlorination</b> of the oxide forms the oxychlorides MO3Cl, so BhO3Cl should be formed in this reaction. Fluorination results in MO3F and MO2F3 for the heavier elements {{in addition to the}} rhenium compounds ReOF5 and ReF7. Therefore, oxyfluoride formation for bohrium may help to indicate eka-rhenium properties. Since the oxychlorides are asymmetrical, and they should have increasingly large dipole moments going down the group, they should become less volatile in the order TcO3Cl > ReO3Cl > BhO3Cl: this was experimentally confirmed in 2000 by measuring the enthalpies of adsorption of these three compounds. The values are for TcO3Cl and ReO3Cl are −51kJ/mol and −61kJ/mol respectively; the experimental value for BhO3Cl is −77.8kJ/mol, very close to the theoretically expected value of −78.5kJ/mol.|$|E
5|$|Though it is {{the least}} {{reactive}} of the halogens, iodine {{is still one of}} the more reactive elements. For example, while chlorine gas will halogenate carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, and sulfur dioxide to phosgene, nitrosyl chloride, and sulfuryl chloride respectively, iodine will not do so. Furthermore, iodination of metals tends to result in lower oxidation states than <b>chlorination</b> or bromination; for example, rhenium metal reacts with chlorine to form rhenium hexachloride, but with bromine it forms only rhenium pentabromide and iodine can achieve only rhenium tetraiodide. By the same token, however, since iodine has the lowest ionisation energy among the halogens and is the most easily oxidised of them, it has a more significant cationic chemistry and its higher oxidation states are rather more stable than those of bromine and chlorine, for example in iodine heptafluoride.|$|E
25|$|Permanent water <b>chlorination</b> {{began in}} 1905, when a faulty slow sand filter and a {{contaminated}} water supply {{led to a}} serious typhoid fever epidemic in Lincoln, England. Dr. Alexander Cruickshank Houston used <b>chlorination</b> of the water to stem the epidemic. His installation fed a concentrated solution of chloride of lime to the water being treated. The <b>chlorination</b> of the water supply helped stop the epidemic and as a precaution, the <b>chlorination</b> was continued until 1911 when a new water supply was instituted.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlorination</b> of S4N4 gives thiazyl chloride.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlorination</b> of hafnium carbide above 250°C.|$|E
25|$|Sucralose is {{manufactured}} by the selective <b>chlorination</b> of sucrose in a multistep synthesis, which substitutes {{three of the}} hydroxyl groups of sucrose with chlorine atoms. This <b>chlorination</b> is achieved by selective protection of a primary alcohol group, followed by <b>chlorination</b> of the partially acetylated sugar with excess chlorinating agent, and then by removal of the acetyl groups to give the desired sucralose product. A company realignment announced April 21, 2015 moved sucralose production from Tate & Lyle's plant on Jurong Island, Singapore to the recently reopened plant in McIntosh, Alabama.|$|E
25|$|A {{more typical}} {{laboratory}} synthesis involves the <b>chlorination</b> of V2O5 using SOCl2.|$|E
25|$|Pasteurization of {{milk and}} <b>chlorination</b> of {{drinking}} water destroy the organism.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{byproduct}} in the <b>chlorination</b> of propene to make allyl chloride.|$|E
25|$|Various factors {{affect the}} water quality in the Dominican Republic, including: poor {{condition}} of purification systems, minimal operational controls, low level of maintenance of treatment plants, and mostly intermittent systems. 38.4% of water systems have no <b>chlorination</b> system installed. These are mostly smaller systems in rural areas. The fact that a <b>chlorination</b> system exists is not a guarantee that water is actually properly disinfected.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the nitration and sulfonation, the direct bromination and <b>chlorination</b> of pyridine proceed well. The reaction of pyridine with molecular bromine in sulfuric acid at 130°C readily produced 3-bromopyridine. The yield is lower for 3-chloropyridine upon <b>chlorination</b> with molecular chlorine {{in the presence of}} aluminium chloride at 100°C. Both 2-bromopyridine and 2-chloropyridine can be produced by direct reaction with halogen with a palladium(II) chloride catalyst.|$|E
25|$|In principle, {{it can be}} {{prepared}} by the <b>chlorination</b> of ethane and, less directly, from ethanol.|$|E
25|$|Victoria's water {{infrastructure}} includes {{a series of}} dams and reservoirs, predominantly in Central Victoria, that hold and collect water {{for much of the}} state. The water collected is of a very high quality and requires little <b>chlorination</b> treatment, giving the water a taste more like water collected in a rainwater tank. In regional areas however, such as in the west of the state, <b>chlorination</b> levels are much higher.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{elements}} that form volatile high-valence fluorides will also form volatile high-valence chlorides. <b>Chlorination</b> and distillation is another possible method for separation. The sequence of separation may differ usefully from the sequence for fluorides; for example, zirconium tetrachloride and tin tetrachloride have relatively low boiling points of 331°C and 114.1°C. <b>Chlorination</b> has even been proposed as a method for removing zirconium fuel cladding, instead of mechanical decladding.|$|E
25|$|Methane is also {{subjected}} to free-radical <b>chlorination</b> {{in the production}} of chloromethanes, although methanol is a more typical precursor.|$|E
25|$|Examples of <b>chlorination</b> {{reactions}} include transformations to dichloroamine {{and nitrogen}} trichloride in acidic medium, {{as described in}} the decomposition section.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlorination</b> {{remains the}} most common form of waste water {{disinfection}} in North America due to its low cost and long-term history of effectiveness. One disadvantage is that <b>chlorination</b> of residual organic material can generate chlorinated-organic compounds that may be carcinogenic or harmful to the environment. Residual chlorine or chloramines may also be capable of chlorinating organic material in the natural aquatic environment. Further, because residual chlorine is toxic to aquatic species, the treated effluent must also be chemically dechlorinated, adding to the complexity and cost of treatment.|$|E
25|$|Sources: Warnings about {{possible}} cholera contamination should be posted around contaminated water sources with directions {{on how to}} decontaminate the water (boiling, <b>chlorination</b> etc.) for possible use.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>chlorination</b> was effective, it was {{difficult}} to manage the pH of the water, as chlorine could cause burning of the skin if wrongly administered. A simple test was devised in 1939 which made <b>chlorination</b> practical. World War II delayed its introduction until the early 1950s. The October 16, 1950 Life magazine had a large illustration of boys swimming together in the indoor pool of New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois, and the caption didn't mention they were naked. The practice continued in the states that had a tradition of nude swimming.|$|E
25|$|Experimentally, ethane {{is under}} {{investigation}} as a feedstock for other commodity chemicals. Oxidative <b>chlorination</b> of ethane has long {{appeared to be a}} potentially more economical route to vinyl chloride than ethene <b>chlorination.</b> Many processes for producing this reaction have been patented, but poor selectivity for vinyl chloride and corrosive reaction conditions (specifically, a reaction mixture containing hydrochloric acid at temperatures greater than 500nbsp&°C) have discouraged the commercialization of most of them. Presently, INEOS operates a 1000 t/a (tonnes per annum) ethane-to-vinyl chloride pilot plant at Wilhelmshaven in Germany.|$|E
25|$|Impurities and {{precious}} metals settle {{to the bottom}} of the electrolytic cells as anode slimes. A <b>chlorination</b> leaching process recovers the gold and silver, which is melted in induction furnaces.|$|E
25|$|Parathion is {{synthesized}} from diethyl dithiophosphoric acid (C2H5O)2PS2H by <b>chlorination</b> {{to generate}} diethylthiophosphoryl chloride ((C2H5O)2P(S)Cl). In a salt metathesis reaction, the chloride treated with sodium 4-nitrophenolate (the {{sodium salt of}} 4-nitrophenol).|$|E
25|$|Polyethylene {{may either}} be {{modified}} in the polymerization by polar or non-polar comonomers or after polymerization through polymer-analogous reactions. Common polymer-analogous reactions are {{in case of}} polyethylene crosslinking, <b>chlorination</b> and sulfochlorination.|$|E
25|$|This {{compound}} {{was first}} prepared in 1933, {{a few years}} after the discovery of rhenium. The preparation involves <b>chlorination</b> of rhenium at temperatures up to 900°C. The material can be purified by sublimation.|$|E
25|$|The density {{varies from}} 1.182 to 1.566kg/L. Other {{physical}} and chemical properties vary widely across the class. As the degree of <b>chlorination</b> increases, melting point and lipophilicity increase, and vapour pressure and water solubility decrease.|$|E
25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of UVGI {{is that while}} water treated by <b>chlorination</b> is resistant to reinfection (until the chlorine off-gasses), UVGI water is not resistant to reinfection. UVGI water must be transported or delivered {{in such a way}} as to avoid reinfection.|$|E
25|$|Water purification: All {{water used}} for drinking, washing, or cooking should be sterilized by either boiling, <b>chlorination,</b> ozone water treatment, {{ultraviolet}} light sterilization (e.g., by solar water disinfection), or antimicrobial filtration {{in any area}} where cholera may be present. <b>Chlorination</b> and boiling are often the least expensive and most effective means of halting transmission. Cloth filters or sari filtration, though very basic, have significantly reduced the occurrence of cholera when used in poor villages in Bangladesh that rely on untreated surface water. Better antimicrobial filters, like those present in advanced individual water treatment hiking kits, are most effective. Public health education and adherence to appropriate sanitation practices are of primary importance to help prevent and control transmission of cholera and other diseases.|$|E
