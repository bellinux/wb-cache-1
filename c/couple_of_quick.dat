25|$|During pre-production, Eiji Tsuburaya had {{toyed with}} the idea of using Willis O'Brien's stop-motion {{technique}} instead of the suitmation process used in the first two Godzilla films, but budgetary concerns prevented him from using the process, and the more cost efficient suitmation was used instead. However, some brief stop motion was used in a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>quick</b> sequences. One of these sequences was animated by Koichi Takano who was a member of Eiji Tsuburaya's crew.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the quick}} scoring {{and the first}} Test result led many {{people to believe that}} Australia would come back with a vengeance {{on the second day of}} the matcht. Instead, Steve Harmison bowled a maiden over first up to Justin Langer, and Matthew Hayden holed out to Harmison's new-ball partner Matthew Hoggard for a golden duck – the first of Hayden's career. The {{dismissal}} was to set the tone of the innings. Although Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer hit runs just as quickly as England had done, the umpire's finger went up twice more before lunch – Ponting swept to the opposing captain Vaughan for 61, and Damien Martyn was run out taking a risky single for 20. Once again, Vaughan was in the action, hitting the stumps with a throw from mid off. Langer and Michael Clarke continued after lunch in the same vein, but again, a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>quick</b> wickets – Clarke edging a quicker ball from Ashley Giles behind and Simon Katich falling in the same way to Andrew Flintoff swung it England's way. At 208 for 5, the Australians were struggling, but another good partnership between Langer and Gilchrist saw them to tea with no further loss.|$|E
2500|$|When England {{arrived in}} Australia Ray Illingworth boasted {{of his new}} ball fast bowlers [...] "The Derbyshire Demon" [...] Alan Ward and [...] "The Abominable Snow Man" [...] John Snow. The [...] tall Ward was 'tall, lean, raw boned youngster with a fine pair of {{shoulders}} and powerful, rhythmical side-on action' compared to Frank Tyson, but suffered from assorted injuries and never made the expected impact in Test cricket. Instead he returned to England and the young Bob Willis was flown out to Australia as his replacement, though few people realised that this tall, gangling bowler with the chest on action would be England's fast bowling spearhead for the next 14 years. John Augustine Snow dominated the series with 31 wickets (22.83). Although {{the son of a}} country vicar who published two volumes of poetry, Snow revelled in his reputation as a big, fast bowler and emerged as Fred Trueman's successor in 1967-68 when he took a record 27 wickets (18.66) in the West Indies. He usually bowled within himself at fast-medium, but sent down a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>quick</b> balls every over as he varied his pace and Australia had no real answer to his fast, short pitched bowling. Snow had a reputation for being mercurial - he took only 7 wickets (71.57) in the state matches - strong-willed and difficult to handle, and his autobiography was suitably entitled Cricket Rebel. Keith Fletcher said [...] "In 1970/71 John Snow was at his peak, obtaining pace and movement off the seam and troubling all the upper-order batsmen". Ken Shuttleworth and Peter Lever provided good support to the two quick bowlers, Lever took 7/83 against the Rest of the World at the Oval, and Shuttleworth 5/47 in the First Test at Brisbane, but neither held down a regular Test place. Basil d'Oliveira helped with his tidy medium pace swing bowling and occasional off-spin. Illingworth himself was an off-spinner of nagging accuracy who contained batsmen rather than took wickets, conceding only 1.91 runs an over in Tests. If [...] "Illy" [...] was proof that spin bowlers mature slowly his partner Derek Underwood was a first class bowler from his teens and he would take his 100th Test wicket and 1,000th First Class wicket on the tour aged only 25. He bowled immaculate slow-medium spinners and used to say that bowling was a [...] "low mentality profession: plug away, line and length, until there's a mistake" [...] as sooner or later every batsmen would make a mistake. On damp English wickets he earned the nickname [...] "Deadly" [...] for his ability to make the ball leap and turn, as when he took 7/50 against Australia at The Oval in 1968 to win the match and square the series with five minutes to spare. The reserve spinner Don Wilson was Illingworth's old Yorkshire [...] "spin twin", but he and Underwood kept him out of the England team, like the other two he was an accurate bowler rather than a wicket-taker.|$|E
