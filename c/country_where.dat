5|$|Sheep {{are not an}} {{important}} part of China's agricultural economy, since the majority of China does not have the large open pastures required for sheep-rearing. Sheep farming is more common in the northwestern provinces of the <b>country,</b> <b>where</b> such tracts of land exist. China does have a native sheep breed, the zhan. The population of the breed has been in decline since 1985, despite government promotion of the breed.|$|E

5|$|The United States is {{a melting}} pot {{consisting}} of numerous ethnic groups. Many of these peoples have kept alive the folk traditions of their homeland, often producing distinctively American styles of foreign music.

5|$|The prose, while simple at {{the level}} of the {{sentence}} (and we can safely assume that Hofmann's translation is very faithful to the original), is shifty, blurred, to the point where at times we are left unsure as to what exactly is going on – a deliberate flight from causation, quite understandable in a <b>country</b> <b>where</b> everyone (even, we learn, the horses) has been driven mad by fear.|$|E

For one week late in November 2016, Windows 10 overtook first rank from Windows 7 in the United States, before losing it again; it becomes more popular every weekend.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{military}} conflict essentially {{ended with the}} 1764 expeditions, Native Americans still called for resistance in the Illinois <b>Country,</b> <b>where</b> British troops had yet to take possession of Fort de Chartres from the French. A Shawnee war chief named Charlot Kaské emerged as the most strident anti-British leader in the region, temporarily surpassing Pontiac in influence. Kaské traveled {{as far south as}} New Orleans in an effort to enlist French aid against the British.|$|E
5|$|Born in Cape Town, South Africa, to William and Bertha Butlin, Butlin had a {{turbulent}} childhood. His parents separated {{before he was}} seven, and he returned to England with his mother.

30|$|The {{variance}} ratio. Differences {{in gender}} variability were {{measured by the}} variance ratio. This ratio has been widely used by authors examining gender variability (Feingold 1992; Nowell and Hedges 1998). The variance ratio expresses the variance of males in relation to that of females. A variance ratio greater than 1 means that males’ variance is higher than females’ variance. A mean variance ratio has been computed for each study (each country being equal to one). For each study, we computed also (1) the proportion of participating <b>countries</b> <b>where</b> the variance ratio is significantly greater than 1 (proportion of <b>countries</b> <b>where</b> the variance is significantly greater for males); (2) the proportion of <b>countries</b> <b>where</b> the variance ratio is greater than 1, but not significantly; (3) the proportion of <b>countries</b> <b>where</b> the variance ratio is lower than 1, but not significantly, and (4) the proportion of <b>countries</b> <b>where</b> the variance ratio is significantly lower than 1 (variance significantly greater for females).|$|R

5|$|By 1965 pirate radio had a British {{audience}} of 10 to 15 million, and by 1966 sold almost £2million worth of advertising {{a year to}} customers including the government-funded Egg Marketing Board. Radio Caroline's audience was one third {{the size of the}} Light Programme in the parts of the <b>country</b> <b>where</b> it could be received, but the Light Programme's audience did not decrease, indicating that pirate radio appealed to an audience that the BBC did not serve.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1874, Smetana {{had become}} {{completely}} deaf but, freed from his theatre duties and the related controversies, he began a period of sustained composition that continued for almost {{the rest of his}} life. His contributions to Czech music were increasingly recognised and honoured, but a mental collapse early in 1884 led to his incarceration in an asylum and subsequent death. Smetana's reputation as the founding father of Czech music has endured in his native <b>country,</b> <b>where</b> advocates have raised his status above that of his contemporaries and successors. However, relatively few of Smetana's works are in the international repertory, and most foreign commentators tend to regard Antonín Dvořák as a more significant Czech composer.|$|E

Nagasaki Prefecture has the highest percentage of Christians: about 5.1% in 1996. , there are 32,036 Christian priests and pastors in Japan. Throughout the latest century, some Western customs originally related to Christianity (including Western style weddings, Valentine's Day and Christmas) have become popular as secular customs among many Japanese.|$|E

5|$|Evaluating Mountfort's works today, one has {{to avoid}} judging them against a {{background}} of similar designs in Europe. In the 1860s, New Zealand was a developing <b>country,</b> <b>where</b> materials and resources freely available in Europe were conspicuous by their absence. When available they were often of inferior quality, as Mountfort discovered with the unseasoned wood in his first disastrous project. His first buildings in his new homeland were often too tall, or steeply pitched, failing to take account of the non-European climate and landscape. However, he soon adapted, and developed his skill in working with crude and unrefined materials.|$|E
5|$|Fortune {{was born}} in Llandudno, North Wales, to a wealthy upper middle-class English family, {{although}} little is known of her early life.

After time spent at a horticultural college she began studying psychology and psychoanalysis at the University of London before working as a counsellor in a psychotherapy clinic. During the First World War she joined the Women's Land Army and established a company selling soy milk products. She became interested in esotericism through the teachings of the Theosophical Society, before joining an occult lodge led by Theodore Moriarty and then the Alpha et Omega occult organisation.|$|E
