Currents along the top and bottom of the coil produce radial forces that do not rotate the head.|$|E

50|$|Copper wire does pose some {{challenges}} {{in that it}} is harder than both gold and aluminum, so bonding parameters must be kept under tight control. The formation of oxides is inherent with this material, so storage and shelf life are issues that must be considered. Special packaging is required in order to protect copper wire and achieve a longer shelf life. Palladium <b>coated</b> <b>copper</b> wire is a common alternative which has shown significant resistance to corrosion, albeit at a higher hardness than pure copper and a greater price, though still less than gold. During the fabrication of wire bonds, copper wire, as well as its plated varieties, must be worked in the presence of forming gas nitrogen and 5% hydrogen or a similar anoxic gas in order to prevent corrosion. A method for coping with copper's relative hardness is the use of high purity 5N+ varieties.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Nanowires of <b>copper</b> can be <b>coated</b> from liquids {{to create}} flexible, {{transparent}} conducting films that can potentially replace the dominant transparent conductor, indium tin oxide, in displays, solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes, and electrochromic windows. One issue with these nanowire films is that copper {{is prone to}} oxidation. It was hypothesized that the resistance to oxidation could be improved by <b>coating</b> <b>copper</b> nanowires with nickel. This work demonstrates a method for synthesizing copper nanowires with nickel shells {{as well as the}} properties of cupronickel nanowires in transparent conducting films. Time- and temperature-dependent sheet resistance measurements indicate that the sheet resistance of copper and silver nanowire films will double after 3 and 36 months at room temperature, respectively. In contrast, the sheet resistance of cupronickel nanowires containing 20 mol % nickel will double in about 400 years. <b>Coating</b> <b>copper</b> nanowires to a ratio of 2 : 1 Cu:Ni gave them a neutral gray color, making them more suitable for use in displays and electrochromic windows. These properties, and the fact that copper and nickel are 1000 times more abundant than indium or silver, make cupronickel nanowires a promising alternative for the sustainable, efficient production of transparent conductors...|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{electron}} flux the apertures can become negatively charged, {{which makes them}} effectively smaller for the passing electrons. This has to be considered when doing {{the design of the}} setup as it is anyway difficult to keep different potentials, of repeller, lenses, screening elements, and the reflector, constant. Unstable potentials on lenses or CHA deflectors would cause fluctuations in the measured signal. Similar problems are caused by external electric or magnetic fields, either they cause fluctuations in the signal, or add a constant offset. That is why the sample is normally shielded by equipotential, metal electrodes to keep the region of the sample field free so that neither the probe electrons nor the sample is affected by external electric fields. Further a cylinder of a material with a high magnetic permeability, e.g. Mu-metal, built around the whole spectrometer to keep magnetic fields or field inhomogeneties at the experiment down to 10 mG or 1mG/cm. Because of the same reason the whole experiment, except the lenses which are normally made of <b>coated</b> <b>copper,</b> is designed in stainless antimagnetic steel and insulating parts are avoided wherever possible.|$|E
