25|$|While many kitchens {{belonging}} to poor families {{continue to use}} clay stoves and the older forms of fuel, the urban middle and upper classes usually have gas stoves with cylinders or piped gas attached. Electric <b>cooktops</b> are rarer since they consume {{a great deal of}} electricity, but microwave ovens are gaining popularity in urban households and commercial enterprises. Indian kitchens are also supported by biogas and solar energy as fuel. World's largest solar energy kitchen is built in India. In association with government bodies, India is encouraging domestic biogas plants to support the kitchen system.|$|E
2500|$|Stainless {{steel is}} an iron alloy {{containing}} {{a minimum of}} 11.5% chromium. Blends containing 18% chromium with either 8% nickel, called 18/8, or with 10% nickel, called 18/10, are commonly used for kitchen cookware. Stainless steel's virtues are resistance to corrosion, non-reactivity with either alkaline or acidic foods, and resistance to scratching and denting. Stainless steel's drawbacks for cooking use {{is that it is}} a relatively poor heat conductor and its non-magnetic property, although recent developments have allowed the production of magnetic 18/10 alloys, and which thereby provides compatibility with induction <b>cooktops,</b> which require magnetic cookware. Since the material does not adequately spread the heat itself, stainless steel cookware is generally made as a cladding of stainless steel on both sides of an aluminum or copper core to conduct the heat across all sides, thereby reducing [...] "hot spots", or with a disk of copper or aluminum on just the base to conduct the heat across the base, with possible [...] "hot spots" [...] at the sides. In so-called [...] "tri-ply" [...] cookware, the central aluminum layer is obviously non-magnetic, and the interior 18/10 layer need not be magnetic, but the exterior 18/10 layer must be magnetic to be compatible with induction <b>cooktops.</b>|$|E
2500|$|An {{electric}} stove {{is a large}} kitchen appliance {{that converts}} electricity into heat in order to cook and bake food. In addition to heated coils atop a stovetop range, glass-ceramic <b>cooktops</b> and induction stoves using electromagnetic induction {{have proven to be}} popular in commercial kitchens as well as for domestic use in homes. Canadian inventor Thomas Ahearn is often credited with inventing the electric cooking range in 1882. However, the first such patent for an electrical stove apparatus was awarded in the United States much earlier to George B. Simpson on September 20, 1859. Simpson's patent, US patent #25532 for an 'electro-heater' surface heated by an platinum-wire coil powered by batteries; is described in his own words to be useful to [...] "warm rooms, boil water, cook victuals...".|$|E
50|$|The DOE {{test cycle}} starts {{with both the}} block and the <b>cooktop</b> at room temperature: 77 °F ± 9 °F (25 °C ± 5 °C). The <b>cooktop</b> is then {{switched}} to maximum heating power. When the test block temperature reaches + 144 °F (+80 °C) above the initial room temperature, the <b>cooktop</b> power is immediately reduced to 25% ± 5% of its maximum power. After 15 minutes of operation at this lower power setting, the <b>cooktop</b> is turned off and the heat energy in the test block is measured. Efficiency is given by the ratio between energy in the block and input (electric) energy.|$|R

50|$|Compared to {{conventional}} kitchen stoves, glass-ceramic <b>cooktops</b> are relatively simple to clean, {{due to their}} flat surface. However, glass-ceramic <b>cooktops</b> can be scratched very easily, so {{care must be taken}} not to slide the cooking pans over the surface. If food with a high sugar content (such as jam) spills, it should never be allowed to dry on the surface, otherwise damage will occur.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s, {{glass-ceramic}} <b>cooktops</b> {{started to}} appear. Glass-ceramic has very low thermal conductivity, a {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of practically zero, but lets infrared radiation pass very well. Electrical heating coils or infrared halogen lamps {{are used as}} heating elements. Because of its physical characteristics, the cooktop heats more quickly, less afterheat remains, and only the plate heats up while the adjacent surface remains cool. Also, these <b>cooktops</b> have a smooth surface and are thus easier to clean, but are markedly more expensive.|$|E
50|$|A Heat Diffuser is {{a cooking}} utensil that {{is placed on}} top of a ring on a <b>cooktop</b> in order to {{separate}} the pan/pot from the direct source of heat.|$|R

5000|$|A {{glass-ceramic}} stove uses {{radiant heating}} coils or infrared halogen lamps as the heating elements. The {{surface of the}} glass-ceramic <b>cooktop</b> above the burner heats up, but the adjacent surface remains cool because of the low heat conduction coefficient of the material.|$|R
