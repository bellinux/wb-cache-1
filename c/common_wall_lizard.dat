5|$|The {{common toad}} (Bufo bufo) {{and the common}} frog (Rana temporaria) are the only {{amphibians}} on the site. They use it in winter or during their migration. The viviparous lizard (Zootoca vivipara) likes the slate deposits and ballast of the track. It hunts in the herbaceous areas, very flowery in summer and high in insects.

The slowworm reproduction (Anguis fragilis) is attested by the observation of young under rocks and other debris.|$|E
5|$|Manual {{removal of}} the Japanese {{knotweed}} has preserved heritage stations of common butterbur and hart's-tongue fern. Early hand pruning was conducive to orchids. The late mowing seems rather ineffective. The grubbing-up of the Canada golden-rod and American asters was successful. The bush clearing and selective logging have helped maintain the wood-fringe with narrow-leaved everlasting-pea and liquorice milkvetch. Common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid, species non-adapted to open areas, benefited areas without clearing. The low dry-stone walls probably favored the installation of viviparous lizard or <b>common</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard,</b> observed in 2013, but also the consolidation of the hart's-tongue fern population.|$|E

40|$|Head {{shape in}} lizards {{correlates}} {{with a wide}} range of environmental pressures, supporting the hypothesis that patterns of phenotypic change represent adaptive responses to selective processes. However, natural selection promotes evolutionary adaptation only if the trait under selection has enough heritable variation. In this study we used geometric morphometrics and quantitative genetics to assess the heritability patterns of the head shape and size of <b>common</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards</b> (Podarcis muralis). Genetic and phenotypic components were estimated using animal models, which showed that more than half of the variation in head morphology is inheritable. Furthermore, at least five independent patterns of genetically determined phenotypic change were detected. These outcomes confirm that morphological differentiation in <b>common</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards</b> may reliably be regarded as the result of adaptive processes driven by natural selection...|$|R

2500|$|Although {{predominantly}} {{not in a}} subtropical climate, some warmer-climate {{flora and}} fauna does reach well into Ohio. For instance, a number of trees with more southern ranges, such as the blackjack oak, Quercus marilandica, are found at their northernmost in Ohio {{just north of the}} Ohio River. Also evidencing this climatic transition from a subtropical to continental climate, several plants such as the Southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), Albizia julibrissin (mimosa), Crape Myrtle, and even the occasional Needle Palm are hardy landscape materials regularly used as street, yard, and garden plantings in the Bluegrass region of Ohio; but these same plants will simply not thrive in {{much of the rest of}} the State. This interesting change may be observed while traveling through Ohio on Interstate 75 from Cincinnati to Toledo; the observant traveler of this diverse state may even catch a glimpse of Cincinnati's <b>common</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizard,</b> one of the few examples of permanent [...] "subtropical" [...] fauna in Ohio.|$|E
50|$|Humans {{and animals}} are mostly {{incapable}} of synthesizing carotenoids, and must obtain them through their diet. Carotenoids {{are a common}} and often ornamental feature in animals. For example, the pink color of salmon, and the red coloring of cooked lobsters and scales of the yellow morph of <b>common</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards</b> are due to carotenoids. It has been proposed that carotenoids are used in ornamental traits (for extreme examples see puffin birds) because, given their physiological and chemical properties, {{they can be used}} as visible indicators of individual health, and hence are used by animals when selecting potential mates.|$|R
40|$|Female <b>common</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards</b> (Podarcis muralis) {{typically}} reproduce {{annually and}} lay {{more than one}} clutch per season. In this study, we tested whether females store sperm between clutches and between years by manipulating mating opportunities of females through appropriate experiments. Our results revealed that females are definitely unable to store sperm for medium or long-term, suggesting they necessary need to repeatedly mate with males to fertilize their eggs. Finally, by comparing our results to other similar multi-clutched species, we conclude that sperm storage probably does not constitute a selective advantage for species with a promiscuous reproductive system based on multiple mating in populations with high densities...|$|R
40|$|The condition-dependent sexual {{dimorphism}} model {{explains the}} evolution {{and maintenance of}} sexual dimorphism in traits targeted by sexual selection, and predicts that the magnitude of sexual dimorphism depends on the variability of individual condition, male traits being more variable than female corresponding traits. Most convincing examples concern insects, while studies among vertebrates are scanty because manipulating condition often is not possible, and the time to reach sexual maturity may be too long. Islands offer {{a unique opportunity to}} compare how the environment affects the expression of sexual dimorphism, since they represent ‘natural experimental sets’ in which different populations of the same species may experience alternative environmental constraints. We investigated the occurrence of context-dependent expression in sexual dimorphism of head shape in insular populations of the <b>common</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards</b> (Podarcis muralis) inhabiting the Tuscan Archipelago (Tyrrhenian Sea). Alternative models were formulated: H 0 assumes that the sexual dimorphism is uninfluenced by islands, H 1 assumes the only effect of phylogeny, H 2 A and H 2 B account for the biogeography of the archipelago (island size and distance from the mainland), while H 3 assumes island-specific effects on sexual dimorphism. Models were compared using Akaike’s information criterion adjusted for multivariate analyses. All hypotheses performed better than H 0, but H 3 largely outperformed all other alternative hypotheses, indicating that environmental features of islands play an additive effect to ontogenetic, biogeographic and genetic factors in defining variation in head shape sexual dimorphism. Our results support the hypothesis of a context-dependent sexual dimorphism in <b>common</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards...</b>|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} whether the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia lusitaniae is associated with lizards, we compared the prevalence and genospecies of spirochetes present in rodent- and lizard-associated ticks at a site where this spirochete frequently infects questing ticks. Whereas questing nymphal Ixodes ricinus ticks were infected mainly by Borrelia afzelii, one-half of the infected adult ticks harbored B. lusitaniae at our study site. Lyme disease spirochetes were more prevalent in sand lizards (Lacerta agilis) and <b>common</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards</b> (Podarcis muralis) than in small rodents. Although subadult ticks feeding on rodents acquired mainly B. afzelii, subadult ticks feeding on lizards became infected by B. lusitaniae. Genetic analysis confirmed that the spirochetes isolated from ticks feeding on lizards {{are members of the}} B. lusitaniae genospecies and resemble type strain PotiB 2. At our central European study site, lizards, which were previously considered zooprophylactic for the agent of Lyme disease, appear to perpetuate B. lusitaniae...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Ecological {{immunology}} {{attempts to}} explain the variability of immune response among individuals by invok-ing costs and trade-offs, which may optimize the immune defence against pathogens. In ectotherms body temperature is correlated {{to that of the}} surrounding environment, so that their entire physiology, including immune functions, is influenced by the environmental temperature. We used in vitro phytohaemoagglutinin (PHA) stimulation in order to assess the effects of temperature on cell mediated adaptive response in male and female <b>Common</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards</b> (Podar-cis muralis). Cell cultures were prepared from blood samples, inoculated with PHA and incubated at 22 °C, 25 °C, 32 °C, and 38 °C for three days. PHA stimulation caused proliferation of T-lymphocytes, but the effect depended on the incubation temperature. Lymphocyte proliferation was significantly impaired at both 22 °C and 38 °C compared to 32 °C, which represented the highest levels of activation. Furthermore, lymphocyte activation was more variable in males while females were less immune suppressed than males at low temperatures. Differences between sexes suggest a possible influence of steroid hormones...|$|R

40|$|Multiple {{advertising}} sexual traits {{may either}} advertise different characteristics of male condition or be redundant to reinforce reliability of signals. Research {{has focused on}} multiple visual traits. However, in animals that use different multiple additional sensory systems, such as chemoreception, different types of traits might have evolved to signal similar characteristics of a male quality using different sensory channels. We examined whether ventral coloration and chemicals in femoral gland secretions of male <b>common</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards,</b> Podarcis muralis, are affected by their health state (blood-parasite load and cell-mediated immune response). Our results indicated that less parasitized lizards had brighter and more yellowish ventral colorations and also femoral secretions with higher proportions of two esters of octadecenoic acid. In addition, lizards with a greater immune response had more saturated coloration and secretions with higher proportions of octadecenoic acid methyl ester. We suggest that these signals would be reliable because only healthier males seemed able to allocate more carotenoids to coloration and presumably costly chemicals to secretions. The use of multiple sensory channels may provide more opportunities to signal a male quality under different circumstances, but also may reinforce {{the reliability of the}} signal when both types of traits may be perceived simultaneously. ...|$|R
40|$|Populations {{adapting}} independently to {{the same}} environment provide important insights into the repeatability of evolution {{at different levels of}} biological organization. In the 20 th century, <b>common</b> <b>wall</b> <b>lizards</b> (Podarcis muralis) from southern and western Europe were introduced to England, north of their native range. Non-native populations of both lineages have adapted to the shorter season and lower egg incubation temperature by increasing the absolute rate of embryonic development. Here we tested if this adaptation is accompanied by signatures of directional selection in the transcriptomes of early embryos and, if so, if non-native populations show adaptive convergence. Embryos from non-native populations exhibited gene expression profiles consistent with directional selection following introduction, but different genes were affected in the two lineages. Despite this, the functional enrichment of genes that changed their expression following introduction showed substantial similarity between lineages, and was consistent with mechanisms that should promote developmental rate. Moreover, the divergence between non-native and native populations was enriched for genes that were temperature- responsive in native populations. These results indicate that small populations are able to adapt to new climatic regimes, but the means by which they do so may largely be determined by founder effects and other sources of genetic drift...|$|R
40|$|Ecological {{aspects of}} the {{dispersal}} behavior of <b>Common</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>Lizards,</b> Podarcis muralis (LAURENTI, 1768), were studied under the short-term effects of population density and individual body condition. The individual dispersal attitude was assessed by comparing emigration rates between two alternative scenarios of (i) moderate starting density (augmentation design) and (ii) high starting density (colonization design). The study system consisted of two interconnected seminatural enclosures simulating two habitat patches linked by corridors. The study revealed that the dispersal activity in the study species {{was influenced by the}} starting lizard density in the enclosures. The study species showed no dispersal behavior in the augmentation design and a density-dependent pattern in the colonization design. Moreover, males moved more frequently between enclosures than females, whereas neither sex nor body condition influenced the dispersal rate. Podarcis muralis showed behavioral similarity with P siculus (RAFINESQUE-SCHMALTZ, 1810), although for this latter species dispersion rate was found to be higher and movements between enclosures to start at lower population densities. Unlike P. siculus, muralis exhibited different dispersal behavior at opposite density conditions: the lizards moved away from enclosures both highly crowded and unpopulated by conspecifics, i. e., avoided to stay longer in initially empty than in occupied enclosures...|$|R

40|$|Populations at range {{limits are}} often {{characterized}} by lower genetic diversity, increased ge-netic isolation and differentiation relative to populations {{at the core}} of geographical ranges. Furthermore, it is increasingly recognized that populations situated at range limits might be the result of human introductions rather than natural dispersal.
