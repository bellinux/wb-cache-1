40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with {{an investigation of the}} evolution in time and space of shot clouds. The shot cloud is produced by launching a number of spherical projectiles from a shotgun barrel. With limited detailed information on the distribution of pellets within a shot cloud generated from previous studies, a considerable part of the investigation is dedicated to the design and implementation of a measurement facility to acquire accurate experimental data. Opto- and acousto-electronics were employed to meet <b>contractual</b> and <b>research</b> requirements in generating timing and positional information on the distribution of pellets in a shot cloud travelling, typically, at transonic velocities. The nature of the measurement facility also allows three-dimensional graphical reconstruction of shot cloud outlines. From the experimental data statistical analysis on the distribution of pellets within shot cloud was performed. Theoretical models are introduced which describe the dispersion of pellets within a shot cloud as it develops in flight. The preliminary work involved the motion of a single sphere in free flight and with the experimental data the deceleration characteristics of pellets were determined. U sing this information a model was developed which predicted the development of the shot clouds from the point where the pellets become independent of one another. Finally, a stochastic model was developed to describe the behaviour of a shot cloud. The equation of motion of a single sphere was perturbed by the addition of a random force term, and the width and length of the cloud were determined by performing ensemble averages. The prediction of these theoretical models were then compared to the experimental data to assess their validity...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to enquire {{into how}} {{building}} information modelling (BIM) and gaming can be integrated to support professionals in their learning about the spatial layout of a new building. This knowledge is important to prepare building operation and facilities management (FM). Design/methodology/approach – Ingrained in task–technology fit theory, this paper reports from {{a case study of}} a serious game staged in the graphical environment of a building information model. A series of interviews with the client, subject-matter experts and software developers involved in developing the game were conducted. The industrial setting for the study is a major hospital construction project in Norway. The project has been awarded BuildingSMART’s 2015 award for “outstanding open BIM practice”, making it Norway’s role model for BIM practice. Findings – Importing and exporting geometry from BIM into a game engine remain challenging. The transfer of data between the two requires workarounds using intermediary software. Apart from issues related to technical interoperability, several sociotechnical challenges influential for the integration of BIM and gaming have been identified, related to: the collaboration among construction, operational and gaming experts; clear communication of information needs; and better <b>contractual</b> agreements. <b>Research</b> limitations/implications – BIM’s geometric and semantic data enabled the creation of a sophisticated game for preparing building operation. Test-users perceived the game to be superior to classroom teaching for learning about the spatial layout of the building.

40|$|Agenda 21 may be {{considered}} the most significant programme of action influencing environmental policy for the Australian development and construction industry. The industry has remained {{one of the most}} rapidly expanding sectors; yet, we have seen the gradual process of exhausting natural resources and irreversible environmental degradation. Even with the introduction of numerous new environmental policies, it remains questionable as to whether real improvements have occurred across the industry.

40|$|The {{processes}} {{of research and}} research training have been radically transformed. The old paradigm of discovery was characterised by the hegemony of disciplinary research and driven by the autonomy of researchers and their host universities. This practice is being superseded-but not replaced-by a new paradigm of knowledge production known as Mode 11 research (Gibbons et al. 1994). Mode 11 research is done by teams of researchers who often have contractual links with, and obligations to, stakeholders external to the university who are underwriting the research. Research students are often vital members of such research teams, and most contemporary doctoral research projects in the sciences would not proceed without external research funding. Some research higher degree candidates {{are members of the}} research team who are undertaking research of commercial potential, where both the host university and the relevant funding body are keen to protect their interests in, and maximise their returns from, the outcomes of the research. Such arrangements present supervisors and their doctoral candidates with significant challenges, which need to be addressed proactively to pre-empt any disputes and loss of trust that can be so damaging to a supervisor-research candidate relationship.

In structuring their contracts, as well as in managing the relationships governed by the contracts, firms try to mitigate uncertainties that could destroy the value-adding potential of such transactions. These uncertainties may be specific to the transaction partner, but they might also arise from the institutional context of the contracting parties, particularly in the case of transactions that cross borders. The coevolutionary process whereby firms both adjust to and shape the institutional constraints facing them results in new hybrid forms of governance, which contribute to the body of private transnational law.

40|$|Although Tanzanian {{policies}} {{are focusing on}} a green productive revolution, there are still various inefficiencies in the agro-industry value chains. This study reveals some causes of these inefficiencies and it offers possible solutions to mitigate them. The study employs property rights, agency and transaction cost theories to explore, describe, and explain these inefficiencies. Using case study methodology, the findings from four case {{studies show that the}} factory owners and the smallholder farmers interact in the market through contracts, which are regulated by semi-governmental crop boards. To facilitate the production of high quality farm produce, the factory owners or the cooperative society of the farmers acts among others as loan guarantors or credit service providers. The relationship between factory owner and farmer is characterized by agency problems of which moral hazard, adverse selection, holdout, and collective action problems manifest themselves. To abate these governance problems, the factory owners employ various instruments such as screening devices, incentives schemes, monitoring and bonding. However, these instruments are costly which impede efficiency. In one case, a fair trade organisation enforces rules on the factory owner and farmers to mitigate these costs and attain a better, i. e. more efficiently, governed agro-industry. In all four cases, the factory owners and the cooperative societies help developing the capacity of the smallholder farmers through training with the objective to transform them into more efficient producers. The training also equips farmers with the skills to handle <b>contractual</b> obligations. The <b>research</b> also reveals that the promotion of cooperative societies in Tanzania is still important as they transform the short term mindset of farmers to a long(er) -term one.

40|$|The {{topic of}} the {{research}} is the institutional governance logics of the funding and contractual steering of the Finnish higher education system. Higher education reforms in Finland and internationally {{have in the past}} decades favored market-orientation and performance measurement. More perspectives to study governance are needed. The research question guides to look for an assumed on-going shift between the recent theorized governance models of New Public Management (NPM) and New Public Governance (NPG), which act as the theoretical framework. This research delves into the institutional logics behind decision making and outspoken political goals. Major concepts are governance, steering, institutional logic, practical reasoning, and agency. The steering activities are made according to institutional governance logics. Institutions are continuously constructed and upheld through the discursive behaviour of the actors, and agency is understood as the actors' possibilities to affect the practical reasoning and the institutional logic of the institutional system. The contents of the selected policy documents regarding the funding and contractual steering are used as the data, and the analysis is based on a categorization of the practical reasoning and the theoretical framework. The findings from the data and the analysis reveal a variety of logical elements. The logical elements of NPM are in a dominant role {{in most parts of the}} funding model, and a shift to a stronger grip of NPM is seen. The elements of NPG are emphasized in parts related to measuring research and other publications, evaluating the societal influence of HEIs, and in the reasoning of the <b>contractual</b> steering.
