The main advantage of the new stemming method is the reduction in the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>blasting.</b> At a limestone quarry, blasting costs per unit volume of rock were reduced by 7 %. This is obtained by increasing burden and spacing distances. In addition, better fragmentation was obtained by using the plaster stemming method.

The main computational bottleneck in the BLAST algorithm is a "nulling and cancellation" step, where the optimal ordering for the sequential estimation and detection of the received signals is determined. To reduce the computational <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>BLAST</b> we develop an efficient square-root algorithm for the nulling and cancellation step.

In a 14 antenna system designed for transmission of 1 Mbit/sec over a 30 kHz channel, the nulling and cancellation computation is reduced from 190 MFlops/sec to 19 MFlops/sec, with the overall computations being reduced from 220 MFlops/sec to 49 MFlops/sec.

This route involves production of Directly Reduced Iron (DRI) using non-coking coal and gases as the reducing agent. The commercial name of DRI is Sponge Iron owing to its spongy appearance since the ore is reduced in solid rather than liquid state. Since DRI can work with low quality non-coking coal, it makes the best possible usage of cheap coal available in India. High {{availability of}} low- quality and iron-ore and coal, the low establishment <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> DRI plants has over the years attracted multitude of opportunist to earn a fortune in this sector.

The production rate and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> hauling are substantially influenced by {{the magnitude of the}} payloads of the trucks (Dickerson et al. 1986) which highly depends on a fill factor decided by the particle size <b>of</b> the <b>blasted</b> material. Lower fragmentation size results in higher fill factor and higher production rate for the trucks. However, when weight capacity of the trucks is reached, production rate remains constant even if fragmentation size decreases. In this case, unnecessary fragmentation causes an increase in unit <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> drilling and <b>blasting.</b> If the bulk density of the loaded material is small, the lowering the fragmentation size can be considered to increase the truck’s production. Otherwise, the weight limit of the trucks does not allow to increase production even though the fragmentation size decreases.|$|R

Study Design: Survey design {{was used in}} designing the questionnaire used for collecting data from the selected quarries. Study Area and Methodology: Twenty four quarries were selected in North- Central Nigeria for this study. Sixteen of these quarries were for commercial purposes while eight were for construction purposes. A total number of one hundred and fifty-five questionnaires were randomly distributed to the workers and managements of the various quarries {{to collect data on}} the quantity <b>of</b> granite rock <b>blasted</b> per month, <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> drilling accessories used, <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> explosives used, <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> maintenance <b>of</b> plant/equipment and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> manpower.

40|$|Drilling and {{blasting}} are {{the major}} unit operations in opencast mining. Inspite of the best efforts to introduce mechanization in the opencast mines, blasting continue to dominate the production. Therefore to cut down the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> production optimal fragmentation from properly designed blasting pattern has to be achieved. Proper adoption <b>of</b> drilling and <b>blasting</b> can contribute significantly towards profitability and therefore optimization of these parameters is essential. Introduction Rock breaking by drilling and blasting is {{the first phase of}} the production cycle in most of the mining operations. Optimization of this operation is very important as the fragmentation obtained thereby affects the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the entire gamut of interrelated mining activities, such as drilling, blasting, loading, hauling, crushing and to some extent grinding. Optimization of rock breaking by drilling and blasting is sometimes understood to mean minimum cost in the implementation of these two individual operations. However, a minimum cost for breaking rock may not be in the best interest of the overall mining system. A little more money spent in the rock-breaking operation can be recovered later from the system and the aim of the coordinator of the mining work should be to achieve a minimum combined <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> drilling, <b>blasting,</b> loading, hauling, crushing and grinding. Only a “balance sheet” <b>of</b> total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the full gamut of mining operations vis-à-vis production achieved can establish whether the very first phase- rock breaking- was “optimum” financially; leaving aside factors of human safety. An optimum blast is also associated with the most efficient utilization <b>of</b> <b>blasting</b> energy in the rock- breaking process, reducing blasting cost through less explosive consumption and less wastage of explosive energy in <b>blasting,</b> less throw <b>of</b> materials, and reduction <b>of</b> <b>blast</b> vibration resulting in greater degrees of safety and stability to the nearby structures. Development <b>of</b> a <b>Blast</b> Optimization Model Selection of proper explosive in any blasting round is an important aspect <b>of</b> optimum <b>blast</b> design. Basic parameters include VOD of explosive (m/s), Density (g/cc), Characteristic impedance, Energy output (cal/gm), and Explosive type (ANFO, Slurry, Emulsion etc.). However, all these parameters can not be taken for optimizing the blasting method successfully. Some of the parameters are taken for minimizing the blasting cost. These cost reduction and optimum blast design parameter will give an economical result. The parameters are i. Drill hole diameter, ii. Powder factor (desired), iii. <b>Cost</b> <b>of</b> explosive, iv. Numbers of holes required to blast. Methodology The study of the various parameters <b>of</b> <b>blasting</b> suggests that the powder factor should be constant as per the requirement. The number of holes desired as per the explosive, the drill ihole diameter as available and the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> explosive are kept as input. The spacing, bench height, burden, charge per hole as depending on the previous parameters can be calculated. From the different input and calculated parameters the total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the method is calculated and the least expensive method is selected as the optimized model. Blasting related information were collected from three different mines of Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. (MCL) for implementation of the optimization model. A program was designed using visual basic on. net platform taking the above parameters into consideration to select the optimized model. It was observed that the program gives satisfactory results. A sample output of the program is as presented below: Conclusion The blast optimization model has been developed with simple methodologies which can be adopted by the mining industry to compare the explosive costs and achieve better blasting results and. The model developed is a user friendly one, since by keeping the powder factor and number of choices of explosives available as constant and by varying the parameters like drill hole diameter, number <b>of</b> holes and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> explosives one can compare the explosive performance and accordingly take a decision to select the proper type <b>of</b> explosives for <b>blasting.</b> It may be noted, that the model has been developed based on case studies of three different mines of MCL, and it can be modified with collection of information from a large number of mines.
