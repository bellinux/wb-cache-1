50|$|Several {{different}} types of lubrication systems are used. Simple two-stroke engines are lubricated by oil mixed into the fuel or injected into the induction stream as a spray. Early slow-speed stationary and marine engines were lubricated by gravity from small chambers {{similar to those used}} on steam engines at the time — with an engine tender refilling these as needed. As engines were adapted for automotive and aircraft use, the need for a high power-to-weight ratio led to increased speeds, higher temperatures, and greater pressure on bearings which in turn required pressure-lubrication for <b>crank</b> <b>bearings</b> and connecting-rod journals. This was provided either by a direct lubrication from a pump, or indirectly by a jet of oil directed at pickup cups on the connecting rod ends which had the advantage of providing higher pressures as the engine speed increased.|$|E

50|$|The {{important}} {{concept of}} pressure lubrication of engine bearings began with high-speed steam engines {{and is now}} a vital part of internal combustion engines. This is both reliable as a lubrication system and also allows the use of hydrodynamic bearings ('oil wedge') that can support greater loads. The first patents for this were issued to Belliss & Morcom in 1890, from the work of their draughtsman Albert Charles Pain. Belliss & Morcom preferred double-acting cylinders, so as to produce the smallest possible engines for a given power; one of their major markets, like Peter Brotherhood, was in supplying generator sets to the Royal Navy for use in the confines of a warship engine room. The difficulty of a double-acting engine was that the direction of the forces in the connecting rod now reverses between compression and tension, so that the bearing clearances must be made tighter to avoid any rattling. Belliss and Morcom developed a two-cylinder engine of 20 bhp at 625 rpm that used a small separate oil pump to feed oil under pressure to the <b>crank</b> <b>bearings,</b> through long drilled holes in the crankshaft. This provided reliable lubrication and cooling and the pressure of the oil film was sufficient to allow the use of double-acting engines with adequate clearance to provide free running.|$|E

The part of more interesting text from this story will translate here: Christened (The story of [...] "granddad") I started my {{job in the}} Far East in 1940s. I was signed on the old riveted steamer «Лиза Чайкина». When I joined the ship I was young alumnus of the Nautical College and was {{signed off on the}} staff assistant stoker. Operations are simple and the same as [...] "steamed turnip": it was necessary to feed the steam boiler with coal. During four hours you feed, eight hours in the rest. And, on the circle. Assistant task: to haul the coal to the furnace... Once my shiftworker, such a healthy [...] "ambal" [...] from Kohtla-Jarve, told me (due to he was Estonian, he uttered the letters D, G, B, V, Ch as T, K, P, F, T respectively and sometimes lost R): — Pefore we entrust the [...] "Montay" [...] to you, you hafe to pe tristenet, frient. Ant it will pe, as in the sonk: [...] "For a moment he saw a plintink likht, fell - the heat (heart) is not peatink any more." [...] As per jargon amongst the stokers, the [...] "Monday" [...] was a hefty scrap and not less than one pound of weight, which broke up slag in the furnace before cleaning the boiler. — So, I was christined, - I say - the grandmother told me that a poop christined me in the village when I was four years old. And his partner immediately corrected: — So, you was christined in the Orthodox faith to be believe in Christ. And here christen in Steamship faith. That you will believe in the power of steam else. It is tradition. Without it you will not survive here. Steam will pull all the juices from you. In short, come tomorrow in the engine room after the daily watch. There all [...] "the clear" [...] will gather in full team. That he meant the whole engine team of the glorious ship «Лиза Чайкина». [...] Next day, just after the watch, I climbed down in engine room and there all my [...] "oily belly buttons" [...] brethren headed by [...] "grand-dad", I means the chief engineer, and waiting. Standing grandly and important. [...] "Grand-dad" [...] wore a tunic with wide chevrons on the sleeves for the solemnity even. And, in hand of the second engineer I observed a big white enamel mug, which was filled with not the water, not the alcohol to the brim. But I did not know details of the christening. I was thinking, if it is alcohol, - the trumped deal, due to I did not drink alcohol also and could normally stand on my feet after the watch. The [...] "grand-dad" [...] came solemnly and shouted in my ear as it was noisly in the engine room due to motors run. However, the diesel engine is more noisly now. So, he shouts me: — Shura, we are now intend to christen you as per maritime tradition and then you will our spirit man, and no any contagion or trouble will not overtake you easy. For this reason we need to make two sacraments, or possible to say — to perform only two conditions: to kiss a <b>crank</b> <b>bearing</b> of the main engine and then drink a cup of seawater. Are you ready? — Ready - I reply. And, thank God, I will hope if it is not alcohol. [...] Regarding <b>crank</b> <b>bearing</b> should be discussed separately. The fact that steam engines connecting rods attached to the pistons, located outside, rather than inside as in modern engines, and they go into the cycle of the piston not reciprocates only, that is up and down, but also too much sweeping to the sides that you have look to avoid its [...] "elbow" [...] does not hurt you if you stand close. The <b>crank</b> <b>bearing</b> is in the lower joint of the elbow and this bearing needs to be lubricated constantly with the machine oil using the oilcans. It is required the highest category skill as a funnel for the pouring was on the rod, which is hopping a dance of death. And a oilcaner, so a motorman was called in that years, was involved unwittingly into the rhythm of this pagan dance, it was independs if he like it or not. And, oilcaner was crouching and twisting when he began to follow movement of the connecting rod, and at the right time he injected the right portion of the oil using big oilcan with a large down-curved nose (outlet pipe). One wrong move, - the oilcan could be striked by the connecting rod and the entire portion of the lubricant will be on your head. So motormen and engineers were unsurpassed dancers in this sense. They were virtuosos of the deal. It is marvel if you look at them from the side. The boogie-woogie is a pathetic parody regarding what they were doing. It is possible to say that their watch passed in the rhythm of this macabre ritual dance with the accompaniment of the romped monster. And an engineer contrives to determine the temperature of a crank some times during the watch also, thus he was controlling its possible overheating. He did it using own palm. A flat of the hand could safely withstand the temperature 70 degrees. And if the temperature is higher, then it begins to burn... Then I did not know all subtleties, but I felt that I encountered the situation. This bearing was dangerous to catch by hand, but here it was necessary to touch by the lips. I took the position. All engine valetry surrounded me, the second engineer was closest and indicate the direction me by the mug to the <b>crank</b> <b>bearing</b> in front of me. I thought: [...] "How long will I fit in? This crank will hits my teeth with the star effects exactly". I stretched my lips out {{in the form of a}} pipe as far as possible and began to approach the [...] "killer". And right now, unfortunately, swayed to the left side, well, and I suddenly kissed the iron elbow so much that my eyes darkened. I woke from a stupor, and immediately the mug was served to me. I swallowed a little water with salt, my eyes climbed up on my forehead, and it burns in my mouth. It turns out, that my two upper teeth had been knocked out and hurted, became painfully due to salt. I wanted to howl. So it turned out, that I did not know who kissed whom - or I kissed the <b>crank</b> <b>bearing</b> or the <b>crank</b> <b>bearing</b> kissed me. But I survived it fully. More finally my forehead was anointed with axle-grease and said to me: — Well, now you're christened as per all rules, and no any adversities will able to hurt you. We accept you into our brotherhood of steam, coal and axle-grease, and, be healthy. [...] And, indeed, after the christening my second breath opened, and the power came from nowhere. I was not tired as before, and was able to beat off and split the outgrowths of slag to pieces by the [...] "monday". I was accustomed to the heat conditions after a week, I did not want to get out from the boiler room. And the fact, that I was christened second time - apparently, this is not in vain, because during my second voyage such situation happened that only a miracle was able to save me.|$|R

The D15B shares the same head as the US Civic Si (D16Z6) but features a unique block, crank, and rods. the car shared the 1.5 L displacement of the other D15 blocks, but the rods were the same length as the D16's (137mm) and a better rod to stroke ratio (1.63) rather than the normal D15's ratio of 1.59. Despite this, the <b>crank</b> and <b>bearing</b> sizes were not the same.|$|R
50|$|A tramp bike is a {{specifically}} converted BMX bike {{that can be}} used on a trampoline. In most cases the bike will have everything removed leaving only the frame, fork, seat and handlebars. This means that the wheels, chain, pedals, <b>cranks,</b> and <b>bearings</b> of a conventional bike are not required. Padding is wrapped and secured with tape around anything sharp that is likely to damage the trampoline. The bike is used to practice difficult tricks as performed during freestyle BMX and freestyle motocross. Some of the tricks that can be done using a tramp bike are: (i) Hell cliker; (ii) Superman;(ii) Superman seat grab; (iv) Cancan; (v) Barrel roll; (vi) Tailwhip; (vi) 360;(vii) 360 Tailwhip; (viii) Bike flip; (ix) Body Varial; (x) Backflip.|$|R

Finite element analysis was performed to obtain the variation of stress magnitude at critical locations. The pressure-volume diagram was {{used to calculate the}} load boundary condition in dynamic simulation model, and other simulation inputs were taken from the engine specification chart. The dynamic analysis was done analytically and was verified by simulation in ADAMS which resulted in the load spectrum applied to <b>crank</b> pin <b>bearing.</b> This load was applied to the FE model in ABAQUS, and boundary conditions were applied according to the engine mounting conditions. The analysis was done for different engine speeds and as a result critical engine speed and critical region on the crankshaft were obtaine...|$|R
40|$|Improving engine {{warm up time}} is {{of great}} {{interest}} because cold start engines suffer from increased fuel consumption. This study comprises of two phases: the first looking at global benefits from a novel engine cooling system incorporating coolant flow control valves and dual EGR setup. The new cooling system showed promising signs of influencing energy flows during warm up, however only limited analysis was possible. The second phase used an instrumented engine to show new ways of quantifying performance enhancements through combustion chamber heat transfer, local bearing oil film temperatures and bearing heat transfer. 1 dimensional heat transfer analysis demonstrated the significant energy required to warm up the engine structure and 25 - 50 kJ heat loss per main <b>crank</b> shaft <b>bearing...</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{crankcase}} {{often has}} {{an opening in}} the bottom to which an oil pan is attached with a gasketed bolted joint. Some crankcase designs fully surround the <b>crank's</b> main <b>bearing</b> journals, whereas many others form only one half, with a bearing cap forming the other. Some crankcase areas require no structural strength from the oil pan itself (in which case the oil pan is typically stamped from sheet steel), whereas other crankcase designs do (in which case the oil pan is a casting in its own right). Both the crankcase and any rigid cast oil pan often have reinforcing ribs cast into them, as well as bosses which are drilled and tapped to receive mounting screws/bolts for various other engine parts.|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 97 - 102 Surveys {{aiming to}} isolate the main causes of severe damage of large {{machines}} such as reciprocating compressors and diesel engines clearly indicate {{the need for a}} reliable method to perform real-time monitoring of the crosshead, <b>crank</b> pin/big end <b>bearing</b> temperatures. The main objective for installing such a system is {{to reduce the risk of}} high cost damage and, thus, increase the overall operational level of safety. However, both the hostile environment inside such large machines and the need for a highly flexible system that easily can be installed and adjusted to different mechanical tolerances have kept exiting solutions form being reliable methods of temperature monitoring on these rotating and orbiting bearings. As an introduction to the main topic of the paper, some selected information on engine damage and causes for such failures - in particular, damage following a detected crosshead and/or <b>crank</b> pin <b>bearing</b> failure situation - have been reviewed. Both indirect and direct methods of bearing temperature measurement are discussed. The main section of the paper describe the applied technical solution for real-time temperature monitoring. The principle of the applied radar technology is presented followed by installation examples and drawings. These are results from both test and permanent installations (refer to ?ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS? at end of paper). The paper ends with a summary of the major issues discussed and the implications that have been achieved in terms of increased operation safety of large reciprocating machines...|$|R
