5|$|After World War II, France granted Chad {{the status}} of {{overseas}} territory and its inhabitants the right to elect representatives to the National Assembly and a <b>Chadian</b> assembly. The largest political party was the <b>Chadian</b> Progressive Party (PPT), based in the southern half of the colony. Chad was granted independence on 11 August 1960 with the PPT's leader, Sara François Tombalbaye, as its first president.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its great}} variety of peoples and languages, Chad {{possesses}} a rich cultural heritage. The <b>Chadian</b> government has actively promoted <b>Chadian</b> culture and national traditions by opening the Chad National Museum and the Chad Cultural Centre. Six national holidays are observed throughout the year, and movable holidays include the Christian holiday of Easter Monday and the Muslim holidays of Eid ul-Fitr, Eid ul-Adha, and Eid Milad Nnabi.|$|E
5|$|In March 1987, {{the main}} Libyan air base of Ouadi Doum was {{captured}} by <b>Chadian</b> forces. Although strongly defended by minefields, 5,000 soldiers, tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft, the Libyans' base fell to a smaller <b>Chadian</b> attacking force led by Djamous equipped with trucks mounted with machine guns and antitank weapons. Observers estimated that, in the <b>Chadian</b> victories {{in the first three}} months of 1987, more than 3,000 Libyan soldiers had been killed, captured, or deserted. Large numbers of tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery, fixed-wing aircraft, and helicopters were captured or destroyed. In some cases, Libya sent its own aircraft to bomb abandoned Libyan equipment to deny its use to the Chadians. It was reported that, in many cases, Libyan soldiers had been killed while fleeing to avoid battle. At Ouadi Doum, panicked Libyans had suffered high casualties running through their own minefields.|$|E

5|$|The Chadian–Libyan {{conflict}} {{was a series}} of sporadic clashes in Chad between 1978 and 1987 between Libyan and <b>Chadian</b> forces. Libya had been involved in Chad's internal affairs prior to 1978 and before Muammar Gaddafi's rise to power in Libya in 1969, beginning with the extension of the <b>Chadian</b> Civil War to northern Chad in 1968. The {{conflict was}} marked by a series of four separate Libyan interventions in Chad, taking place in 1978, 1979, 1980–1981 and 1983–1987. In all of these occasions Gaddafi had the support of a number of factions participating in the civil war, while Libya's opponents found the support of the French government, which intervened militarily to save the <b>Chadian</b> government in 1978, 1983 and 1986.|$|E
5|$|The largest <b>Chadian</b> {{delegation}} {{to reach the}} Olympics appeared in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea and at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain; each time, Chad's National Olympic Committee sent six athletes. During the 1992 games, the NOC sent the nation's first female Olympian. Since then (and up to the Beijing games), at least one woman {{has been a part}} of the <b>Chadian</b> delegation. The smallest contingency of <b>Chadian</b> Olympians occurred during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, when only Kaltouma Nadjina competed on the country's behalf. The delegation that arrived in Beijing consisted of two athletes—one man (30-year-old Moumi Sébergué) and one woman (15-year-old Hinikissia Albertine Ndikert), both participants in track events. Ndikert was Chad's flagbearer at the ceremonies. Up to and including the Beijing games, there has yet to have been a medalist from Chad.|$|E
5|$|According to Nolutshungu, the 1984 {{bilateral}} Franco-Libyan agreement {{may have}} provided Gaddafi with {{an excellent opportunity}} to find an exit from the <b>Chadian</b> quagmire, while bolstering his international prestige and giving him an opportunity to force Habré into accepting a peace accord which would have included Libya's proxies. Instead, Gaddafi misread France's withdrawal as a willingness to accept Libya's military presence in Chad and the de facto annexation of the whole BET Prefecture by Libya, an action that was certain to meet the opposition of all <b>Chadian</b> factions and of the OAU and UN. Gaddafi's blunder would eventually bring about his defeat, with the rebellion against him of the GUNT and a new French expedition in 1986.|$|E

5|$|Apparently formidable, the Libyan {{military}} disposition in Chad was {{marred by}} serious flaws. The Libyans were prepared for a war {{in which they would}} provide ground and air support to their <b>Chadian</b> allies, act as assault infantry, and provide reconnaissance. By 1987, however, Muammar Gaddafi had lost his allies, exposing Libya's inadequate knowledge of the area. Libyan garrisons came to resemble isolated and vulnerable islands in the <b>Chadian</b> Sahara. Also important was the low morale among the troops, who were fighting in a foreign country, and the structural disorganization of the Libyan army, which was in part induced by Gaddafi's fear of a military coup against him. This fear led him to avoid the professionalization of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|As of 2004, {{the highest}} number of Chadians {{participating}} at any one Games was six at both the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea, and at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. Nor had any <b>Chadian</b> ever won a medal at an Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Chad, a {{landlocked}} country in Central Africa, participated in 11 Summer Olympic games between {{its debut in}} the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan and the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The highest number of <b>Chadian</b> athletes to {{have participated in the}} summer games is six in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. , no <b>Chadian</b> athlete has ever won a medal at the Olympics. Two athletes from Chad qualified for the London games; Hinikissia Ndikert in the women's track and field 200 metres and Carine Ngarlemdana in the women's 70 kilogram judo completion. Chad had no men competing for them; they and Bhutan were the only nations to send only female athletes to the 2012 games.|$|E

50|$|Chad is not {{a member}} despite Arabic being one of its two {{official}} languages, some 12% of <b>Chadians</b> identifying as Arab and around 900,000 are Arabic-speaking. It applied for membership in March 2014.|$|R
5|$|The decisive {{confrontation}} between the Libyan-FAP forces and the <b>Chadian</b> regular forces took place at Faya-Largeau, {{the capital of the}} BET. The city, defended by 5,000 <b>Chadian</b> soldiers, fell on 18 February after sharp fighting to a force of 2,500 rebels, supported by possibly as many as 4,000 Libyan troops. The Libyans do not seem to have directly participated in the fighting; in a pattern that was to repeat itself in the future, the Libyans provided armor, artillery and air support. The rebels also were much better armed than before, displaying Strela-2 surface-to-air missiles.|$|E
5|$|The {{highest number}} of Chadians {{participating}} at any one Games was six at both the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea, and at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. No <b>Chadian</b> has ever won a medal at an Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The {{music group}} Chari Jazz formed in 1964 and {{initiated}} Chad's modern music scene. Later, more renowned {{groups such as}} African Melody and International Challal attempted to mix modernity and tradition. Popular groups such as Tibesti have clung faster to their heritage by drawing on sai, a traditional style of music from southern Chad. The people of Chad have customarily disdained modern music. However, in 1995 greater interest has developed and fostered the distribution of CDs and audio cassettes featuring <b>Chadian</b> artists. Piracy {{and a lack of}} legal protections for artists' rights remain problems to further development of the <b>Chadian</b> music industry.|$|E

50|$|When {{the country}} became {{independent}} in 1960, Chad had no university. For {{the first decade}} of the nation's life, students who wished to study beyond the secondary level had to go abroad. In the 1966-67 school year, eighty-three <b>Chadians</b> were studying outside the country; the following year, this number rose to 200. In the early years, almost all students seeking advanced education were male. The largest number went to France (30 percent in the academic year 1966-67, for example), but some <b>Chadians</b> studied in Belgium, Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire, and Congo. At that time, most students were pursuing degrees in education, liberal arts, agriculture, and medicine.|$|R
25|$|Afrol News {{reported}} on 25 May that about 2,000,000 <b>Chadians</b> {{were at risk}} of having a famine occur in their regions after the combined effects of 2 years of drought and pestilence had ruined their harvest yet again.|$|R
5|$|Through French {{pressure}} on Libya and {{the mediation of}} Nigerien President Hamani Diori, the two countries resumed diplomatic relations on 17 April 1972. Shortly after, Tombalbaye broke diplomatic relations with Israel and {{is said to have}} secretly agreed on 28 November to cede the Aouzou Strip to Libya. In exchange, Gaddafi pledged 40 million pounds to the <b>Chadian</b> President and the two countries signed a Treaty of Friendship in December 1972. Gaddafi withdrew official support to the FROLINAT and forced its leader Abba Siddick to move his headquarters from Tripoli to Algiers. Good relations were confirmed in the following years, with Gaddafi visiting the <b>Chadian</b> capital N'Djamena in March 1974; in the same month a joint bank was created to provide Chad with investment funds.|$|E
5|$|To {{put an end}} to the deadlock, Gaddafi {{proposed}} on 30 April {{a mutual}} withdrawal of both the French and Libyan forces in Chad. French President François Mitterrand showed himself receptive to the offer, and on 17 September the two leaders publicly announced that the mutual withdrawal would start on 25 September, and be completed by 10 November. The accord was at first hailed by the media as proof of Mitterrand's diplomatic skill and a decisive progress towards the solution of the <b>Chadian</b> crisis; it also demonstrated Mitterrand's intent of following a foreign policy independent from both the US and the <b>Chadian</b> government regarding Libya and Chad.|$|E
5|$|Chad's {{official}} {{languages are}} Arabic and French, but over 100 languages and dialects are spoken. Due to {{the important role}} played by itinerant Arab traders and settled merchants in local communities, <b>Chadian</b> Arabic has become a lingua franca. Chad submitted an application to join the Arab League as a member state on 25 March 2014, which is still pending.|$|E
5|$|Chad's {{energy sector}} has had years of {{mismanagement}} by the parastatal Chad Water and Electric Society (STEE), which provides power for 15% of the capital's citizens and covers only 1.5% {{of the national}} population.

50|$|Roughly 4.8 million {{citizens}} were registered to vote, {{which is just}} two-fifths of the population.

The chairperson of the independent electoral commission reported a 56.6% participation turnout.|$|R
5|$|Feeling that a {{complete}} {{destruction of the}} GUNT would be an intolerable blow for his prestige, and fearing that Habré would provide support for all opposition to Gaddafi, the Colonel called for a Libyan intervention in force, as his <b>Chadian</b> allies could not secure a definitive victory without Libyan armor and airpower.|$|E
5|$|Football is Chad's {{most popular}} sport. The country's {{national}} team is closely followed during international competitions and <b>Chadian</b> footballers have played for French teams.

5|$|In 2016, Hissène Habré {{was sentenced}} to life in prison in Senegal for crimes against humanity. Chad has also been {{included}} on Presidential Proclamation 9645, the expanded version of United States president Donald Trump's Executive Order 13780, which restricts entry by nationals from 8 countries, including Chad, into the US. This move has angered the <b>Chadian</b> government.|$|E
50|$|The {{conference was}} a failure, as it soon foundered on {{procedural}} points and questions of representation, and, at a deeper level, {{due to the}} deep mistrust between northern and southern <b>Chadians.</b> Déby used it to divide the opposition, allying himself with groups willing {{to put an end}} to armed confrontation with the government.|$|R
2500|$|The BBC {{reports that}} after his {{repatriation}} Al Garani {{has not been}} able to receive any official identity documents, because Chad officials are not sure he is actually a citizen. [...] They report that since Al Garani grew up in Saudi Arabia he is unable to speak to any other <b>Chadians</b> in their local language.|$|R
5|$|Chad {{has more}} than 200 {{distinct}} ethnic groups, which create diverse social structures. The colonial administration and independent governments have attempted to impose a national society, but for most <b>Chadians</b> the local or regional society remains the most important influence outside the immediate family. Nevertheless, Chad's peoples may be classified according to the geographical region in which they live.|$|R
