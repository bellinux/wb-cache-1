Argüello {{was also the first}} native-born Californian to govern the state. He at first was very opposed to the independence revolution. He threatened anyone in favor of the Mexican revolution. But when Canon Agustin Fernandez de San Vicente, the commissioner from the imperial Spanish regency, came to Monterey and asked him to transfer his allegiance to Mexico, he complied. He took down the Spanish flag and raised the new Mexican flag.In his tenure one new mission was founded: Mission San Rafael Arcángel on December 14, 1817.|$|R

40|$|The <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> {{registry}} and {{classification society}} {{are an integral}} part of the target factors used by Port State Control authorities (PSC) when deciding on vessels to select for inspection.

Using data on PSCs collected over 6 years from 7, 500 vessels, we study the relevance of this assumption using bivariate Probit models. Our estimates show that vessels in relatively bad conditions are more likely to be subject to flag- and class-hopping and that these phenomena are more likely amongst vessels which have changed flag and class in the past. ...|$|R

50|$|Following the {{invasion}} and occupation of Iraq by the United States in 2003, the Iraqi government was overthrown, and the Ba'ath Party was outlawed. Strong speculation followed that the U.S. government would {{press for a}} change in the Iraqi flag to remove its pan-Arab symbolism, and to make a definitive break with the period of Ba'athist rule. To a degree, this view was shared by some groups in Iraq. In addition to some displeasure among Iraqis who had suffered under Saddam Hussein to retaining national symbols used by his government, there was also strong aversion to the flag from Iraq's Kurdish minority, who resented its evocation of pan-Arabism. However, Iraqi opponents <b>of</b> <b>changing</b> the <b>flag</b> argued that since the flag had been used since 1963, long before Saddam Hussein's presidency, it was unfair to characterise it as a 'Saddamist' flag. They also stressed that pan-Arabism has been a dominant popular principle among Iraqi's majority population for decades prior to Iraqi independence in 1932.|$|R
