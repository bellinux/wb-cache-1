25|$|In 1920 {{the bridge}} deck needed repair. The repairs were {{completed}} and the bridge repainted, marking {{the last time}} Lyndon Bridge was painted. In 1939 the south pier began to settle into the riverbed. The concrete piling {{and some of the}} concrete inside the pier's steel casing was deteriorating. The dilapidated concrete in the casing was replaced and a new <b>concrete</b> <b>footing</b> was poured. In 1968 the abutment on which the bridge's south approach rests was repaired and a new deck installed at a cost of $6,800. The deck was again replaced in 1976 for an additional $4,500.|$|E
25|$|The {{main feature}} of Lions Park {{is a series}} of long terraces, formed by boulder walls and garden beds that descend the steep slope falling from Canberra Terrace. A number of trees are planted {{throughout}} this area, including wind-stunted endemic Eucalypt species and Grevillea robusta. Along the Canberra Terrace boundary is a small car park with a garden bed at the southern end. A sandstone block in this garden displays a plaque containing historical information about the lighthouses. To the east of the garden bed is a boulder set in a round <b>concrete</b> <b>footing</b> with a memorial plaque dedicated to World War II servicemen attached (erected 1991). With the exception of the memorial, none of the remainder of these elements is considered to be of state-level cultural heritage significance. It is the extent of the largely undeveloped site (part of the original lighthouse reserve) that is significant, rather than the elements that comprise the park.|$|E

Case studies of two real structures are presented in this paper. One is a 10 storey concrete building which is considered as a non-slender structure with complex boundary conditions. The other is a single span <b>concrete</b> <b>foot</b> bridge which is also a relatively inflexible planar structure with complex boundary conditions.

There are sixteen trusses spanning the interior space. Each is composed of four curved half-trusses which are pinned at the foundations and at the apex where they meet.

Therefore, each half-truss consists of four timber chords sprung into arch form, with light timber bracing nailed into position to form a curved open-latticed box truss. The trusses are made entirely of sawn pieces of native hardwood nailed together.|$|R

50|$|The Bedell Bridge was a Burr truss covered {{bridge that}} spanned the Connecticut River between Newbury, Vermont and Haverhill, New Hampshire. Until {{its most recent}} {{destruction}} in 1979, it was, with a total length of 382 ft, the second-longest covered bridge in the United States. The bridge was divided into two spans of roughly equal length, and rested on a central pier and shore abutments constructed from mortared rough stone. The eastern abutment has been shored up {{by the addition of}} a <b>concrete</b> <b>footing.</b> The bridge was 23 ft wide, with a roadway width of 18.5 ft. Because the state line is the western low-water mark of the Connecticut River, most of the bridge is in New Hampshire; only the western abutment is in Vermont.|$|E
50|$|A taut wire {{perimeter}} security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually {{mounted on a}} fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick {{that there is no}} need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to ignore objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A <b>concrete</b> <b>footing</b> directly below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.|$|E
