40|$|The {{amount of}} {{suspended}} solid material transported by a stream is usually determined by making measurements of sediment-content and of velocity at many {{points in the}} cross-section and integrating the results. The number of sampling points required will depend upon the degree of accuracy necessary, and, according to O'Brien [see 1 of “References” at end of paper], upon our knowledge of turbulent flow {{and its relation to}} sediment-transportation. The suspended-load samplers used for these measurements may be divided into two classifications, depending upon the length of the sampling period. One might be called the integrating or <b>continuous</b> <b>sampler,</b> and the other the instantaneous or grab sampler. Turbulent fluctuations cause the sediment-content at any point in a stream to be continually-varying; therefore, only an integrated sample, taken {{over a period of time}} long enough to get an average concentration, can truly represent the sediment-content. This integration may be made with a <b>continuous</b> <b>sampler</b> of the suction-nozzle type, which maintains the same velocity at the entrance as the undisturbed velocity of the stream at that point. (Continuous suction-nozzle samplers are now being used in the Cooperative Laboratory of the Soil Conservation Service at the California Institute of Technology.) The mean concentration may also be obtained by combining a number of small grab-samples which show the true instantaneous sediment-content...|$|E

The sampler only requires access to the gradient of the log-density function, hence the normalizing constant is not needed. We prove the proposed Markov chain is invariant for the target distribution and illustrate its applicability through a wide range of examples. We show that the sampler introduced in the present paper is intimately related to the <b>continuous</b> <b>sampler</b> of Peters and de With (2012), Bouchard-Cote et al. (2017). In particular, the computation is quite similar in the sense that both are centered around simulating an inhomogenuous Poisson process. The computation can be simplified when the gradient of the log-density admits a computationally efficient directional decomposition into a sum of two monotone functions. We apply our sampler in selective inference, gaining significant improvement over the formerly used sampler (Tian et al. 2016) ...|$|E

To investigate the sewage outflow for Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), N, pH and heavy metals, a <b>continuous</b> <b>sampler</b> was installed at two hospitals and a Medical School. Samples were analysed by atomic absorption spectrometry for As, Hg, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn and Fe. Mercury levels ranged from l- 70 μg l⁻¹, exceeding the Environmental Target Quality of 0. 04 μg l⁻¹, and the South African General Effluent Standard of 20 μg l⁻¹. All other heavy metals were below General Effluent Standard Limits. In addition, a sludge sample from the Athlone Wastewater Plant was tested for Hg, realising 6 mg kg⁻¹ on a dry weight basis, which was within Department of Health (DOH) Guidelines of 10 mg kg⁻¹. Samples of incinerator bottom ash analysed for heavy metal content gave Hg concentrations of 1. 1 - 4. 0 mg kg⁻¹, and Zn concentrations of 5. 1 - 11. 0 g kg⁻¹. Incinerator ash was also analysed for radio-activity and substantial levels of ¹²⁵I (332 - 650 bq kg⁻¹), and Ga⁶⁷ (9186 bq kg⁻¹) recorded, which exceeded the South African limits of 200 bq kg⁻¹. In Cape Town, hospital incinerators are old, burn large amounts of plastics and produce toxic emissions. They are all situated in residential or inner-city areas, and {{even though there is}} legislation dealing with emissions and chemical waste, these laws are not being enforced. Based on the above results, an investigation was carried out to assess attitudes to and knowledge of hazardous waste in the ten institutions. One thousand questionnaires were administered to staff, and the data from the 80 % response rate statistically analysed. Results suggest that there is an urgent need for an holistic approach to toxic {{waste management}}, encompassing enforceable legislation coupled with on-going educational programmes and strong support from top management and all levels of staff...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{presentation}} of particulate matter data collected from February 2007 to June 2008. Personal environment monitors (PEM), which measured 7 -day PM 2. 5 concentrations, had been deployed at 14 homes during the 2007 year and deployed in 16 different homes during the 2008 sampling year. Within each sampling year, sampling occurred for two one-week (7 -day) periods during each season. In addition to PEM sampling, a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) <b>continuous</b> <b>sampler</b> had been deployed in both indoors and outdoors at one pre-selected household per week. Gravimetric, chemical, and black carbon analysis had been performed on the PEM PM 2. 5 filters while time-series plots of the TEOM PM 10 and PM 2. 5 data were constructed to extract diurnal patterns from the data. Results from the TEOM data affirm the purported existence of a strong diurnal patter in particulate matter observations in the El Paso region. ^ Strong increases in particulate matter were seen, on average, between the hours of 06 : 00 and 10 : 00 (morning) and once again in the evening from 16 : 00 to 20 : 00. Of the TEOM data, the mean outdoor and indoor PM 2. 5 concentrations were found to be 23. 9 µg/m 3 and 17. 8 µg/m 3, while the mean outdoor and indoor PM 10 concentrations were found to be 27. 3 µg/m 3 and 18. 0 µg/m 3, respectively. Mean outdoor and indoor TEOM PM 2. 5 concentrations were found to be, on average, greater during the summer seasons. The mean TEOM outdoor PM 10 was also found to be greater during the summer seasons over the winter seasons, while the mean indoor PM 10 TEOM concentration was found to be only slightly greater during the winter seasons over the summer seasons. Indoor/Outdoor (I/O) ratios for PM 10 for all TEOM sampling locations during the entire study period were found to be greater, on average, than (I/O) ratios for PM 2. 5 with values of 1. 15 and 1. 05, respectively. ^ A mean PM 2. 5 concentration of 19. 8 µg/m 3 was seen in the PEM indoor samples collected at all locations during the entire study period, while the mean winter concentration 22. 9 µg/m 3 was shown to be much higher than the mean summer concentration 16. 8 µg/m 3. Results of an EDXRF analysis found that geologic elements (Al, Si, Ca, Fe, Ti, and K) were found to compose a majority of the total PM 2. 5 mass at 17. 4 %, while toxic trace elements (Cu, Cr, As, Cd, and Pb) were found to compose only 0. 19 % of the total PM 2. 5 mass. All analyzed elements (Σ Elements) were found to compose, on average, 24 % of the total PM 2. 5 mass collected using the PEM sampler. The mean black carbon (BC) concentration on the PEM filters for the entire study period was found to be 0. 30 µg/m 3; BC concentrations were also found to be higher during the winter seasons, 0. 38 µg/m 3, than the summer seasons, 0. 21 µg/m 3. Black carbon was also found to compose, on average, 1. 8 % of the total PM 2. 5 mass. ^ Principle components analysis (PCA) was conducted on the EDXRF data and presented four primary components within the elemental data. The first component included Al, Ba, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Pb, Sr, Ti, and V, while the second component included Cr, Ga, Mo, and Ni. The third component consists of As, Rh, and Te, while the final component was composed of what is believed to be salt (Na and Cl). The first component, composed of mostly geologic material, composed the greatest majority of elements found in the total PM mass, while the other components were mostly hypothesized to be related to industrial release in the area. ...|$|E

Hospitals are {{a major source of}} antibiotics released into the environment. To reduce these residues, research to improve knowledge of the dynamics of antibiotic release from hospitals is essential. Therefore, we undertook a study to estimate seasonal and temporal variation in antibiotic release from two hospitals in India over a period of two years. For this, 6 sampling sessions of 24 hours each were conducted in the three prominent seasons of India, at all wastewater outlets of the two hospitals, using <b>continuous</b> and grab <b>sampling</b> methods. An in-house wastewater sampler was designed for <b>continuous</b> <b>sampling.</b> Eight antibiotics from four major antibiotic groups were selected for the study. To understand the temporal pattern of antibiotic release, each of the 24 -hour sessions were divided in three sub-sampling sessions of 8 hours each.

Six of the eight antibiotics studied were detected in the wastewater <b>samples.</b> Both <b>continuous</b> and grab <b>sampling</b> methods indicated that the highest quantities of fluoroquinolones were released in winter followed by the rainy season and the summer.
