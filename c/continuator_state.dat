25|$|The {{analysis}} of the succession of states {{with respect to the}} 15 post-Soviet states is complex. The Russian Federation is seen as the legal <b>continuator</b> <b>state</b> and is for most purposes the heir to the Soviet Union. It retained ownership of all former Soviet embassy properties, as well as the old Soviet UN membership and permanent membership on the Security Council.|$|E
5000|$|International {{convention}} {{since the}} end of the Cold War has come to distinguish two distinct circumstances where such privileges are sought by such a successor state, in only the first of which may such successor states assume the name or privileged international position of their predecessor. The first set of circumstances arose at the dissolution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1991. One of this federation's constituent republics, the Russian Federation has declared itself to be [...] "the <b>continuator</b> <b>state</b> of the USSR" [...] on the grounds that it contained 51% of the population of the USSR and 77% of its territory. In consequence, Russia agreed that it would acquire the USSR's seat as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. This was also accepted by the rest of the former states of the USSR; in a letter dated 24 December 1991, Boris Yeltsin, at the time President of the Russian Federation, informed the Secretary-General that the membership of the Soviet Union in the Security Council and all other United Nations organs was being continued by the Russian Federation with the support of the 11 member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States. All Soviet embassies became Russian embassies.|$|E
40|$|If Scotland votes 'Yes' to the {{question}} 'Should Scotland be an independent country?' how will its relationship change with {{the remainder of the}} UK? A 'yes' vote will have huge financial, political and legal implications. This article, written by Candace Guite, considers the current role of the UK Supreme Court in Scotland, the recent conflict (to which the title alludes) and it reflects on Scotland's potential international status. The UK Government has argued that it would be regarded as the <b>continuator</b> <b>state</b> and an independent Scotland would be a successor state, and so, {{in the event of a}} 'yes' vote Scotland would have to re-apply for entry to the European Union and the United Nations. However, there are arguments to support the alternative option, that Scotland could be regarded as a co-equal successor state with England, and thus would retain EU and UN membership...|$|E
30|$|The {{following}} table {{shows that}} three modalities of secession exist under the international law: An armed conflict (like in Croatia), a unilateral separation (Kosovo), and {{an agreement with}} the central state (Montenegro). These situations have in common that the desire for secession comes from one part of the initial territory. In turn, an unanimous will of separation, representing the whole population and territory of a state, provokes a scission. The initial state is dissolved in favor of several entities. A recent example of a scission is the separation of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic into Czech Republic and Slovakia on 31 December 1992, which was negotiated by governments. We call successor state a state which has lost a part of its territory by secession but keeps existing under international law. Among others, it was the case of Pakistan after the secession of Bangladesh in 1971, of Ethiopia when Eritrea became independent in 1993, of Serbia after the separation of Montenegro in 2006, and of Sudan after the independence of South Sudan in 2011. Nevertheless, both a separation and a scission may provoke the dissolution of the initial state. Indeed, if after one or several secessions a state is regarded as substantially different from the initial state, it may lose its juridical personality and transform itself into a new state. As an illustration, we may recall that the Yugoslavian Federal Republic was not recognized as the <b>continuator</b> <b>state</b> after four out of six of its entities became independent.|$|E
40|$|Scientific {{interest}} in issues concerning federalism, which implies determining {{the difference between}} a confederation (a union of confederal states) and a federation (a federal state comprising federal entities) seems to have disappeared after the dissolution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1992, the country which had existed in the period from 1945 to 1992 under different names: the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia (DFY), the Federal Peoples' Republic of Yugoslavia (FPRY), and finally the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). Although a number of other confederations or federations (notably, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia) ceased to exist in the 20 th century, history bears witness of the establishment of two important associations of states: the United Nations Organisation (UN) and the European Union (EU). They are highly significant for Serbia, which is a member state of the UN and cherishes close cooperation with the EU. However, the dissolution of the SFRY has not resolved some important issues among its former member states. The basic postulate of these problems {{is the fact that the}} Federal Peoples' Republic of Yugoslavia (FPRY as 'the second Yugoslavia') is not the successor state of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia ('the first Yugoslavia') because 'the first Yugoslavia' was never dissolved, i. e. its international personality did not cease to exist; namely, the 'second Yugoslavia' is only the <b>continuator</b> <b>state</b> (ensuring the continuity of the state in the territory of its predecessor), just as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was the <b>continuator</b> <b>state</b> rather than the successor state of the Kingdom of Serbia. Hence, the problem comes down to the identity of legal subjects. The essential difference between a confederation and a federation are as follows: 1) confederation member states may autonomously decide whether they would act independently abroad (e. g. to maintain diplomatic relations, to conclude international agreements, etc.); on the other hand, federal entities (members of a federation) do not have such an option, or they may possibly be given such an option (to an extend which is considered relevant) by the central (federal) government; 2) the internal borders between confederation member states may be changed only by international treaties adopted at an international conference, whereas the internal borders between federal entities may be unilaterally established and changed by the central government; 3) confederation member states, in principle, have the secession right (ius secessionis) to withdraw from the confederation, whereas federal entities have no such right. It should be noted that a confederation, as a rule, has a capacity of legal personality in international law, just as its individual members. Yet, the difference between the internal state law and public international law is quite relative. Namely, as noted by Toma Živanović, international law (both private and public) is governed by collision norms. While the essence of private international law is conflict resolution involving subjective private rights and obligations arising from the internal law of different states, the essence of public international law is resolution of conflicts between different sovereign states. The basic difference between a confederation and a federation is that each confederation member state is the holder of supreme power (sovereignty), whereas the federal units in a federal state have no such power, given the fact that sovereignty is exclusively vested in the federation (federal state). The supreme power is a de facto matter; it implies the capacity to maintain public order in a specific territory. Relying on the comparative research of different confederations and federations, the author comes to a conclusion that the 'second Yugoslavia' (FPRY) was actually a confederation (despite its official title). However, this conclusion raises the question of borders between its former member states, particularly considering that these (FPRY) borders were not established by any international treaty. Given the fact that there is legal continuity between the Kingdom of Serbia, the 'First Yugoslavia' (Kingdom of Yugoslavia) and the 'Second Yugoslavia' (FPRY), the solution must be sought in the process of restitution, which implies a return to a prior state of affairs that existed before the creation of the (first) Yugoslav state...|$|E
