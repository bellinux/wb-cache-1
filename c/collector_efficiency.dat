In this first report, the basic equations are derived by applying the one-dimensional analytical model to evaluate the effect of the various parameters on the <b>collector</b> <b>efficiency,</b> including evaporator performance, condenser performance and heat loss coefficient of the panel. It is found that when the evaporator performance is improved, the mean plate temperature decreases whereas the working fluid temperature increases making lessen the heat loss from the plate and thus the <b>collector</b> <b>efficiency</b> improved. On the other hand, when the condenser performance is improved, the mean plate and the working fluid temperature decrease. Therefore the <b>collector</b> <b>efficiency</b> is improved.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} the derivation of a modified equation for solar <b>collector</b> <b>efficiency</b> that is expressed using the heating load term {{instead of the}} inlet fluid temperature term from the currently used linear <b>collector</b> <b>efficiency</b> equation.

The numerical results show that the <b>collector</b> <b>efficiency</b> increases as the collector height and NP volume fraction increase and then reaches a maximum value. An optimum collector height (∼ 10  mm) and particle concentration (∼ 0. 03 %) achieving a <b>collector</b> <b>efficiency</b> of 90 % of the maximum efficiency can be obtained under the conditions used in the simulation.

40|$|An axisymmetric, multistage, {{depressed}} {{collector of}} fixed geometric design was evaluated {{in conjunction with}} an octave bandwidth, dual mode traveling wave tube (TWT). The TWT was operated {{over a wide range}} of conditions to simulate different applications. The collector performance was optimized (within the constraint of fixed geometric design) over the range of TWT operating conditions covered. For operation of the TWT in the linear, low distortion range, 90 percent and greater <b>collector</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were obtained leading to TWT overall efficiencies of 20 to 35 percent, as compared with 2 to 5 percent with an undepressed collector. With <b>collectors</b> of this <b>efficiency</b> and minimized beam interception losses, it becomes practical to design dual mode TWT's such that the low mode can represent operation well below saturation. Consequently, the required pulse up in beam current can be reduced or eliminated, and this mitigates beam control and dual mode TWT circuit design problems. For operation of the dual mode TWT at saturation, average <b>collector</b> <b>efficiencies</b> in excess of 85 percent were obtained for both the low and high modes across an octave bandwidth, leading to a three to fourfold increase in the TWT overall efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Solar energy {{collectors}} are {{a special}} kind of heat exchangers that transform solar radiation energy to internal energy of the transport medium. The major component of any solar system is the solar collector. This is a device which absorbs the incoming solar radiation, converts it into heat, and transfers this heat to a fluid (usually air, water, or oil) flowing through the collector. The measurement of the flat plate collector performance is the <b>collector</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The <b>collector</b> <b>efficiency</b> is the ratio of the useful energy gain to the incident solar energy over a particular period of time.
