This paper presents the results of research which forms part of a larger study on the theoretical predictions of residual stresses in cold-formed sections. The paper is concerned with residual stresses that arise from the <b>coiling</b> and <b>uncoiling</b> process experienced by steel sheets before they are cold formed into sections. In this paper, a closed-form solution is presented for these residual stresses, in which the <b>coiling</b> and <b>uncoiling</b> process is modelled as an elastic-plastic plane strain pure bending problem with the steel assumed to obey the von Mises yield criterion and the Prandtl-Reuss flow rule. To facilitate its application in subsequent finite element simulation of the cold-forming process, the prediction of equivalent plastic strains is also addressed in this solution. The accuracy of the solution is demonstrated by comparing its predictions with those from a finite element simulation. Numerical results from the analytical solution are also presented to illustrate the development process of residual stresses and the effects of coiling curvature and yield stress on the final residual stresses.

Although all flower visiting Lepidoptera regularly {{come in contact}} with pollen, only Heliconius and Laparus butterflies actively collect pollen with the proboscis and subsequently take up nutrients from the pollen grains. This study focused on the behavior of pollen processing and compared the movement patterns with proboscis grooming behavior in various nymphalid butterflies using video analysis. The proboscis movements of pollen processing behavior consisted of a lengthy series of repeated <b>coiling</b> and <b>uncoiling</b> movements in a loosely coiled proboscis position combined with up and down movements and the release of saliva. The proboscis-grooming behavior was triggered by contamination of the proboscis in both pollen feeding and non-pollen feeding nymphalid butterflies. Proboscis grooming movements included interrupted series of <b>coiling</b> and <b>uncoiling</b> movements, characteristic sideways movements, proboscis lifting, and occasionally full extension of the proboscis. Discharge of saliva was more pronounced in pollen feeding species than in non-pollen feeding butterfly species. We conclude that the pollen processing behavior of Heliconius and Laparus is a modified proboscis grooming behavior that originally served to clean the proboscis after contamination with particles...|$|R

40|$|Many {{kinds of}} adult Lepidoptera insects possess a long {{proboscis}} {{which is used}} to suck liquids and has the <b>coiling</b> and <b>uncoiling</b> movements. Although experiments revealed qualitatively that the coiling movement is governed by the hydraulic mechanism and the uncoiling movement is due to the musculature and the elasticity, it needs a quantitative investigation to reveal how insects achieve these behaviors accurately. Here a quasi-one-dimensional (Q 1 D) curvature elastica model is proposed to reveal the mechanism of these behaviors. We find that the functions of internal stipes muscle and basal galeal muscle which locate at the bottom of proboscis are to adjust the initial states in the <b>coiling</b> and <b>uncoiling</b> processes, respectively. The function of internal galeal muscle which exists along proboscis is to adjust the line tension. The knee bend shape is due to the local maximal spontaneous curvature and is an advantage for nectar-feeding butterfly. When there is no knee bend, the proboscis of fruit-piercing butterfly is easy to achieve the piercing movement which induced by the increase of internal hydraulic pressure. All of the results are in good agreement with experiential observation. Our study provides a revelatory method to investigate the mechanical behaviors of other 1 D biologic structures, such as proboscis of marine snail and elephant.

During extinction periods, many ammonoids are affected by drastic simplifications of their shell geometry, ornamentation and suture line. We observe that relatively tightly coiled ammonites can give rise to highly evolute forms or uncoiled heteromorphs with simple ornamentation and almost ceratitic suture line-a phenomenon called "proteromorphosis". Such simplifications often correspond to a reappearance of ancestral geometries (primitive ornamentation, evolute <b>coiling</b> or <b>uncoiling)</b> which suggest that the evolutionary clock of these organisms can be reinitialized by extreme, sublethal, environmental stress such as giant volcanism (including its consequences on diverse pollutions and on climatic changes) and major regressive events.

50|$|To {{carry out}} gene expression, a cell must control the <b>coiling</b> and <b>uncoiling</b> of DNA around histones. This is {{accomplished}} {{with the assistance}} of histone acetyl transferases (HAT), which acetylate the lysine residues in core histones leading to a less compact and more transcriptionally active chromatin, and, on the converse, the actions of histone deacetylases (HDAC), which remove the acetyl groups from the lysine residues leading to the formation of a condensed and transcriptionally silenced chromatin. Reversible modification of the terminal tails of core histones constitutes the major epigenetic mechanism for remodeling higher-order chromatin structure and controlling gene expression. HDAC inhibitors (HDI) block this action and can result in hyperacetylation of histones, thereby affecting gene expression. The open chromatin resulting from inhibition of histone deacetylases can result in either the up-regulation or the repression of genes.|$|R
40|$|The {{recombination}} of linked genes is a funda-mental {{property of}} genetic systems ranging {{from those of}} the bacteriophages to higher plants and animals. Until recently, our consideration of gene recombination through crossing over has been directed toward those forms whose genetic material is clearly organized into a complex of macromolecules formed into chromosomes. As a logical consequence, the major hypotheses pro-posed to explain the mechanism of crossing over have drawn heavily upon cytological studies of various animal and plant chromosomes and in particular, they have been directed toward the differentiation of certain chromosomes into chromomeric and non-chromomeric egions (Bell-ing, 1933) and to the <b>coiling,</b> <b>uncoiling,</b> and "opening out " of chromosomes arly in meiosis (Darlington, 1935; Sax, 1930, 1932). The discovery of linkage between genetic factors in bacteria (Lederberg, 1947), in bacterio-phage (Hershey and Rotman, 1948), and in pneumocoecus transformation (Hotchkiss and Marmur, 1954) and more recently in the trans-duction of genetic factors in Salmonella (Demerec and Demerec, 1955) has broadened the field of investigation i to recombination mechanisms to organisms whose genetic systems were not as clearly defined as in many higher forms. However, in the genetic systems of higher and lower forms alike, deoxyribonucleic a id (DNA) is considered to be of fundamental significance. This is true of higher forms where DNA occurs in the nucleus and specifically in the chromosomes where its quantity is correlated with chromosome number. Similarly, it undergoes a duplication which is in turn associated with chromosome doubling. It is the active genetic material in phage (Hershey and Chase, 1952) and in the transforming principle of pneumoeoccus. In both of these cases recombi-nation of genetic factors has been demonstrated (Hershey and Rotman, 1948 and Hotchkiss and Marmur, 1954). What is apparently a one to one relationship between DNA and genetic material, particularly in phage and pneumococcus along with the recombination of linked genetic factors points up the real possibility for a form of recom-bination or crossing over {{at the level of the}} DNA molecule.

Laboratory measurements of residual stresses by destructive methods are not only time-consuming but also of limited accuracy.

The method offers a powerful tool for exploring the effect of different forming parameters on the magnitude and distribution of residual stresses,so that these forming parameters can be optimized.

Numerical results from this method are shown to agree closely with laboratory measurements,demonstrating the validity and accuracy of the method.

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} focused on the {{modeling}} of rod-like elastic bodies that have an initially curved and thin-walled cross-section and that undergo important localized changes of the cross-section shape. The typical example is the folding of a carpenter's tape measure for which the folds are caused by the flattening of the cross-section in some localized areas. In this context, we propose a planar rod model that accounts for large displacements and large rotations in dynamics. Starting from a classical shell model, the main additional assumption consists in introducing an elastica kinematics to describe the large changes of the cross-section shape with very few parameters. The expressions of the strain and kinetic energies are derived by performing an analytical integration over the section. The Hamilton principle is directly introduced in a suitable finite element software to solve the problem. The folding, coiling and deployment of a tape spring is studied to demonstrate the ability of the model to account for several phenomena: creation of a single fold and associated snap-through behavior, splitting of a fold into two, motion of a fold along the tape during a dynamic deployment, scenarios of <b>coiling</b> and <b>uncoiling</b> of a bistable tape spring.

In the analytical solution, the coiling-uncoiling stage is modelled as an inelastic plane strain pure bending problem; the stainless steel sheets are assumed to obey Hill's anisotropic yield criterion with isotropic hardening to account for the effects of material anisotropy and nonlinear stress-strain behaviour. The accuracy of the solution is demonstrated by comparing its predictions with those obtained from a finite element analysis.
