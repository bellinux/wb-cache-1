The {{purpose of this study is}} to briefly identify the various prospects, problems, and policies for energy efficiency in industries. Basis of purpose on the negative impacts caused due to the increased use of energy consumption in industries. This literature study is based from practical examples of industries, industrial applications and other new technology. As the electric motor system operates most of the industrial processes, the electricity consumption of motors in industries accounts for two thirds of total energy consumption. Influencing energy efficiency in industries provides substantial advantages. Various motor applications such as pumps, fans, air compressors, <b>cooling</b> <b>compressors,</b> variable speed drives is studied for their operation and working conditions. The utilization of energy efficient technologies to a greater extent can perceive savings to the industries. In spite of being aware of potentials of using energy efficient technologies in industries, energy efficient technologies are not widely used. A barrier to energy efficiency is explained as a practice that inhibits the industrial decision of being efficient in terms of energy and finance. The barriers consent with energy efficiency in industries is fair enough to be considered, while compromising energy for temporary prosperity is not upright. Influence of increased energy efficiency in market areas need coordination of all industries and commercial area throughout the country. The coordination between the industries and commercial sectors can be closely achieved by raising energy policies and energy regulations. The energy efficient policies are considered as cognizance for market transformation and this can maintain the industry, the environment, and the energy. The options available for market transformation are enormous. It is suggested to implement the energy efficient policies as energy efficiency is important for sustainable future. By adopting the right policy, at right situation can provide enormous benefits to the process, industry, and nation.

40|$|Abstract Today Sweden has 341 {{ice hockey}} arenas, around 140 outdoor ice hockey rinks, 60 ice fields for bandy and about 35 curling arenas. In addition, {{the numbers of}} indoor bandy arenas are increasing. The cooling systems {{installed}} today {{should be able to}} lower its energy consumption with 10 - 30 %. In this thesis, Ronneby ice-arena has been researched. This artificial cooling facility was inaugurated 2011 {{and is one of the}} newest in Sweden. This is an outdoor ice field for bandy and therefor has no roof or walls to cover the field. Ronneby ice-arena has problems with uneven cooling distribution of the ice field. This results in cracks and uneven ice quality. These problems also result in higher energy consumption than necessary. To find a solution for the uneven cooling of the ice field flow measurements were carried out in the brine circuit. To get a better understanding of the cooling distribution, temperature measurements were carried out on the brine feeding lines. A calculation has been performed on what energy savings a speed control of the brine circulation pumps depending on the outdoor temperature could generate. Another calculation was made to see the possible savings with a windshield around the field. In this thesis the benefits of a heat recovery system on the <b>cooling</b> <b>compressors</b> refrigerant has been investigated. The heat recovery system could heat the locker rooms, the clubhouse, the showers and the hot water for the Zambonis. In order to perform the necessary calculation for this thesis, Fredriksbergs BK and Ronneby municipality provided operating data. The actions proposed to Ronneby ice-arena to solve the uneven cooling of the ice field is to change the location of the brine feeding line connection point. At the same time this work is carried out it’s suggested that the brine feed and return lines get insulated. When the uneven cooling problems have been solved, a speed control system should be installed to control the brine circulation pumps, in order to lower the electricity consumption. Ronneby ice-arena has the possibility to install a heat recovery system. Therefore it is suggested to install a heat exchanger on each cooling compressor refrigerant. This installation is to be used to heat the clubhouse, the showers and the hot water for the Zambonis. The system to cool the condensers with seawater and currently the heat pump are not optimal designed.

40|$|The thrust {{capability}} of turbojet cycles is reduced at high flight Mach number (3 +) by {{the increase in}} inlet stagnation temperature. The 'hot section' temperature limit imposed by materials technology sets the maximum heat addition and, hence, sets the maximum flight Mach number of the operating envelope. Compressor pre-cooling, either via a heat exchanger or mass-injection, has been suggested {{as a means to}} reduce compressor inlet temperature and increase mass flow capability, thereby increasing thrust. To date, however, no research has looked at <b>compressor</b> <b>cooling</b> (i. e., using a compressor both to perform work on the gas path air and extract heat from it simultaneously). We wish to assess the feasibility of this novel concept for use in low-to-high Mach number flight. The results to-date show that an axial compressor with cooling: (1) relieves choking in rear stages (hence opening up operability), (2) yields higher-pressure ratio and (3) yields higher efficiency for a given corrected speed and mass flow. The performance benefit is driven: (i) at the blade passage level, by a decrease in the total pressure reduction coefficient and an increase in the flow turning; and (ii) by the reduction in temperature that results in less work required for a given pressure ratio. The latter is a thermodynamic effect. As an example, calculations were performed for an eight-stage compressor with an adiabatic design pressure ratio of 5. By defining non-dimensional cooling as the percentage of compressor inlet stagnation enthalpy removed by a heat sink, the model shows that a non-dimensional cooling of percent in each blade row of the first two stages can increase the compressor pressure ratio by as much as 10 - 20 percent. Maximum corrected mass flow at a given corrected speed may increase by as much as 5 percent. In addition, efficiency may increase by as much as 5 points. A framework for characterizing and generating the performance map for a <b>cooled</b> <b>compressor</b> has been developed. The approach is based upon CFD computations and mean line analysis. Figures of merit that characterize the bulk performance of blade passage flows with and without cooling are extracted from CFD solutions. Such performance characterization is then applied to a preliminary compressor design framework (mean line). The generic nature of this approach makes it suitable for assessing the effect of different types of <b>compressor</b> <b>cooling</b> schemes, such as heat exchange or evaporative cooling (mass injection). Future work will focus on answering system level questions regarding the feasibility of <b>compressor</b> <b>cooling.</b> Specifically, we wish to determine the operational parametric space in which <b>compressor</b> <b>cooling</b> would be advantageous over other high flight Mach number propulsion concepts.

40|$|This report {{identifies}} and quantifies the cycling {{losses in}} a domestic refrigerator-freezer. During cycling operation the refrigerator {{was found to}} operate between 5 and 25 % less efficient then the corresponding quasisteady machine. The cycling refrigerator operates with an evaporator capacity between 3 and 17 % less than the quasi-steady refrigerator, {{while at the same}} time requiring between 1 and 9 % more power to operate. This refrigerator performance degradation was attributed to several factors, the most important being the refrigerant migration and the thermal mass of the evaporator and compressor. During the off-cycle refrigerant migrates from the condenser to the evaporator as the system pressures equalize. The off-cycle migration increases the temperature of the evaporator and necessitates refrigerant redistribution during the on-cycle, and thereby tends to reduce system performance. The increased power requirements, traced to the compressor, result from slight differences in system pressure and the reduced compressor efficiency due to a <b>cool</b> <b>compressor.</b> With the cycling losses identified, several possible refrigerator design changes were suggested. It appears that a refrigerator equipped with a reciprocating compressor, solenoid valves to isolate the condenser, and no accumulator should operate in a nearly quasi-steady manner.

However, since the experimental refrigerator was equipped with an accumulator which held up some charge manipulating the condenser fan showed little payoff.

Hermetic compressor motor design also face the same challenge. However, reducing motor size for same compressor capacity will increase the motor power density, with the same motor cooling design as before, motor running temperature will be increased and this affect both motor life and reliability as well as passing UL certification requirement for compressors using OLP (internal overload protector). Hermetic motor cooling improvement using thermal modelling has been investigated before by using thermal network method, with limited accuracy since this do not taken all thermal correlation between motor and compressors. (refer to Purdue paper: thermal modelling ro the motor in semi-hermetic screw refrigeration compressor under part load conditions) However, the real situation in terms of thermal and fluid distribution which affect motor <b>cooling</b> inside the <b>compressor</b> in much more complicated than a pure thermal lumped circuit can represent. With the usage of fluid and thermal coupled simulation method today, we can simulate and understand more accurately the correlation between motor and compressor heat transfer and fluid distribution to optimize motor cooling channel, both in static and dynamic stage, and keep motor temperature under the accepted level while main a good flow for the overall compressor performance. In this paper, different geometry of stator outer diameter profiles are investigated, to balance between the motor efficiency impacts versus the motor temperature increase, compressor and conclude the optimization in terms of stator outer profile for the compressor structure discussed in this paper. Motor efficiency results are calculated and also tested, motor cooling optimization also calculated and tested inside compressor. From the research work done here, we can see that by using CFD tool (ANSYS), compressor motor design engineers can find the optimal stator lamination design, and understand the biggest influence factor to motor cooling, but not important for motor electromagnetic design and performance.

40|$|Evaporative cooling {{of fluids}} under {{compression}} reduces the input work with relatively low equipment costs. Currently, water injection at about 1 % {{of the air}} mass-flow rate is used; additional cooling can be obtained with higher injection rates. Water is non-toxic and relatively non-corrosive, which makes it the fluid of choice for evaporatively-cooled compressors in gas turbines. Water does have a relatively low vapor-pressure, that tends to limit the amount evaporated, although its large heat of vaporization partially compensates for this deficiency. Residence times in compressors are {{of the order of}} hundredths of seconds. Hence, the time available for evaporation is brief. One expectation is that higher-vapor-pressure refrigerants could evaporate at higher rates, and hence overcome some of the limitations of water. We present here a study of such a refrigerant, but the results fall short of expectations: evaporation is projected to occur fast initially, but the reduced work expectation does not fully materialize. A heat-and-mass transfer model that predicts droplet evaporation is used for our projections. Three parameters are varied to determine their effects on the compressor calculated performance: injection ratio, initial droplet radius, and pressure ratio. Low compressor discharge temperatures appear possible, which in some applications in gas turbines could uphold definite promise for recuperative cycles. Yet, the difficulties associated with the combustion process involving a refrigerant may very well override all other considerations. For the general case of evaporatively-cooled compression, high-pressure substances would need much larger heats of vaporization than the ones considered here for their application to be sustainable as compared with water.
