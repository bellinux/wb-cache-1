40|$|ABSTRACT The two-microelectrode {{technique}} of <b>voltage</b> <b>clamping</b> sheep cardiac Purkinje fibers {{was used to}} examine the changes in contraction which occur during trains of <b>voltage</b> <b>clamps.</b> (A "train " is defined as a series of <b>voltage</b> <b>clamps</b> delivered at a particular rate, beginning after a rest long enough that the effects of previous stimulation have died away.) Contractions showed striking staircases, or progressive changes in peak isometric tension, during trains. Short <b>clamps,</b> <b>clamps</b> to <b>voltages</b> more negative than [...] 20 or [...] 30 mV, or holding potentials less negative than the resting potential favored negative staircases, while long clamps, <b>clamps</b> to positive <b>voltages,</b> and holding potentials near the resting potential each favored positive staircases. The staircase behavior appeared to be due to changes in the initial rate of recovery of the ability to contract. The changes in staircase behavior as a function of <b>clamp</b> <b>voltage</b> suggested that the relationship between peak tension and <b>clamp</b> <b>voltage</b> should depend on the experimental design. When the steady-state contraction was plotted as a function of <b>clamp</b> <b>voltage,</b> voltage-tension relations like those recently reported for working ventricle were obtained, with a threshold between [...] 30 and [...] 40 mV and a steep relation between tension and voltage. When the first contraction after a rest was plotted, the threshold voltage was more negative, the curve was flatter, and the peak tensions at inside positive voltages were reduced...|$|R

50|$|This number defines {{how much}} energy a MOV-based surge {{protector}} can theoretically absorb {{in a single}} event, without failure. Counter-intuitively, a lower number may indicate longer life expectancy if the device can divert more energy elsewhere and thus absorb less energy. In other words, a protective device offering a lower <b>clamping</b> <b>voltage</b> while diverting the same surge current will cause more of the surge energy to be dissipated elsewhere in that current's path. Better protectors exceed peak ratings of 1000 joules and 40,000 amperes.|$|E

The effect of the diode volt drop on the circuit output will be divided down by the gain of the amplifier, resulting in an insignificant error. The circuit also has a great improvement in linearity at small input signals in comparison to the simple diode circuit.|$|E
5000|$|A common {{application}} {{is to protect}} electronic circuits against damaging high voltages. The avalanche diode {{is connected to the}} circuit so that it is reverse-biased. In other words, its cathode is positive with respect to its anode. In this configuration, the diode is non-conducting and does not interfere with the circuit. If the voltage increases beyond the design limit, the diode goes into avalanche breakdown, causing the harmful voltage to be conducted to ground. When used in this fashion, they are often referred to as clamping diodes or transient voltage suppressors because they fix or [...] "clamp" [...] the maximum voltage to a predetermined level.

50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} commonly design higher joule-rated surge protectors {{by connecting}} multiple MOVs in parallel. Since individual MOVs have slightly different non-linear responses {{when exposed to}} the same overvoltage, any given MOV might be more sensitive than others. This can cause one MOV in a group to conduct more (a phenomenon called current hogging), leading to overuse and eventually premature failure of that component. If a single inline fuse is placed in series with the MOVs as a power-off safety feature, it will open and fail the surge protector even if remaining MOVs are intact. Thus, the effective surge energy absorption capacity of the entire system {{is dependent on the}} MOV with the lowest <b>clamping</b> <b>voltage</b> and the additional MOVs do not provide any further benefit. This limitation can be surmounted by using carefully matched sets of MOVs, but this matching must be carefully coordinated with the original manufacturer of the MOV components.|$|E

40|$|Instrumentation of the {{universal}} <b>clamp.</b> <b>Voltage</b> <b>clamp</b> {{has been an important}} method for studying current-voltage relationships across membranes of excitable cells such as neurons and muscles. The conventional <b>voltage</b> <b>clamp</b> amplifiers have been based on analog feedback controls. In this study a prototype digital <b>voltage</b> <b>clamp</b> system has been developed, which uses a digital signal processor (DSP) to implement feedback controls. The development was guided by computer simulation of both analog and digital <b>voltage</b> <b>clamps</b> that interact with a neuron model.

The DSP-based <b>voltage</b> <b>clamp</b> provides the possibility of interactions with the excitable cells by changing control algorithms dynamically. The instrument should also be useful in research areas such as brain-machine interface and neuromuscular controls of prosthetic limbs, where dynamic interactions between electrodes and excitable cells are important. ^ Modeling in biochemistry. Because the exact underlying mechanisms of many biochemical processes are still unknown, modeling and simulation methods are useful for describing, understanding, and predicting these processes based on limited amount of experimental data. In this study, a model based on forward/reverse rates and an associated parameter estimation method are developed. The model uses experimental data obtained from the steady state states to construct a state-space representation of the biochemical process. The associated parameter estimation method can be used to reduce the inconsistency among experimental data that may come from different sources. The resulting model parameters define a well-behaved mathematical model in the steady state. Based on experimental data collected separately from individual sub-steps of a pathway, this approach achieves overall optimization in two steps: flux optimization and individual parameter optimization. The method is also useful for identifying an initial state in modeling the dynamics of a biochemical pathway. ...|$|R
