The two latter methods are new to Scania and wereevaluated in depth. Furthermore, field-aged samples, which had had theircatalytic performance tested in another study, were investigated, in an attemptto find some link between characterization results and catalytic activity. Theinvestigation of oven-aged samples yielded information about the timescales ofcarrier sintering and sintering of <b>catalytically</b> <b>active</b> <b>material,</b> showing theformer to be much slower than the latter.

The present paper demonstrates an approach to modify diatoms both in vivo and in vitro to produce a porous aluminosilicate that is serving as a potential source for sustainable catalyst production. The obtained material was characterized at various processing stages with respect to morphology, elemental composition, surface area, and acidity. The cell walls appeared normal without morphological changes, while their aluminum content was raised from the molar ratio n(Al) :n(Si) 1 : 600 up to 1 : 50.

40|$|The multistep flow {{synthesis}} of vinyl azides and their application in the {{synthesis of}} vinyltriazoles is reported. The synthesis relies on a stable polymer-bound equivalent of iodine azide that serves to carry out 1, 2 -functionalization of alkenes in a telescope flow protocol. The intermediate 2 -iodo azides are subjected to a DBU-mediated polymer-supported elimination step yielding vinyl azides in good yield. The third step involves the formation of vinyl triazoles by a copper-catalyzed Huisgen-"click" cycloaddition. The required heat is generated by electromagnetic induction based on copper. Copper serves both as heatable as well as <b>catalytically</b> <b>active</b> packed-bed <b>material</b> inside the flow reactor. Fonds der Chemischen IndustrieHenkel AG & Co.
