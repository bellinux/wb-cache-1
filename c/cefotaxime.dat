25|$|Hospitalized {{patients}} {{without risk}} for pseudomonas: This group requires intravenous antibiotics, with a quinolone active against streptococcus pneumoniae (such as levofloxacin), a β-lactam antibiotic (such as <b>cefotaxime,</b> ceftriaxone, ampicillin/sulbactam or high-dose ampicillin plus a macrolide antibiotic (such as azithromycin or clarithromycin) for seven to ten days.|$|E
25|$|Antibiotics are {{the primary}} treatment. The {{specific}} approach to their use {{is dependent on the}} individual affected and the stage of the disease. For most people with early localized infection, oral administration of doxycycline is widely recommended as the first choice, as it is effective against not only Borrelia bacteria but also a variety of other illnesses carried by ticks. Doxycycline is contraindicated in children younger than eight years of age and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; alternatives to doxycycline are amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and azithromycin. Individuals with early disseminated or late infection may have symptomatic cardiac disease, refractory Lyme arthritis, or neurologic symptoms like meningitis or encephalitis. Intravenous administration of ceftriaxone is recommended as the first choice in these cases; <b>cefotaxime</b> and doxycycline are available as alternatives.|$|E

500|$|While other {{treatments}} for croup have been studied, none have sufficient {{evidence to support}} their use. Inhalation of hot steam or humidified air is a traditional self-care treatment, but clinical studies have failed to show effectiveness and currently it is rarely used. The use of cough medicines, which usually contain dextromethorphan or guaifenesin, are also discouraged. While breathing heliox (a mixture of helium and oxygen) to decrease the work of breathing {{has been used in}} the past, there is very little evidence to support its use. [...] Since croup is usually a viral disease, antibiotics are not used unless secondary bacterial infection is suspected. In cases of possible secondary bacterial infection, the antibiotics vancomycin and <b>cefotaxime</b> are recommended. In severe cases associated with influenzaA or B, the antiviral neuraminidase inhibitors may be administered.|$|E

2500|$|These enzymes {{were named}} for their greater {{activity}} against <b>cefotaxime</b> than other oxyimino-beta-lactam substrates (e.g., ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, or cefepime). Rather than arising by mutation, they represent examples of plasmid acquisition of beta-lactamase genes normally {{found on the}} chromosome of Kluyvera species, a group of rarely pathogenic commensal organisms. These enzymes are not very closely related to TEM or SHV beta-lactamases in that they show only approximately 40% identity with these two commonly isolated beta-lactamases. More than 80 CTX-M enzymes are currently known. Despite their name, a few are more active on ceftazidime than <b>cefotaxime.</b> They have mainly been found in strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and E. coli, but have also been described in other species of Enterobacteriaceae and are the predominant ESBL type in parts of South America. (They are also seen in eastern Europe) CTX-M-14, CTX-M-3, and CTX-M-2 are the most widespread. [...] CTX-M-15 is currently (2006) the most widespread type in E. coli the UK and is widely prevalent in the community. An example of beta-lactamase CTX-M-15, along with ISEcp1, {{has been found to}} have recently transposed onto the chromosome of Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC BAA-2146.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment of CAP in {{children}} {{depends on the}} child's age and the severity of illness. Children under five are not usually treated for atypical bacteria. If hospitalization is not required, a seven-day course of amoxicillin is often prescribed, with co-trimaxazole an alternative when there is allergy to penicillins. Further {{studies are needed to}} confirm the efficacy of newer antibiotics. [...] With the increase in drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, antibiotics such as cefpodoxime may become more popular. Hospitalized children receive intravenous ampicillin, ceftriaxone or <b>cefotaxime,</b> and a recent study found that a three-day course of antibiotics seems sufficient for most mild-to-moderate CAP {{in children}}.|$|E
2500|$|For infections {{caused by}} ESBL-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella species, {{treatment}} with imipenem or meropenem {{has been associated}} with the best outcomes in terms of survival and bacteriologic clearance. Cefepime and piperacillin/tazobactam have been less successful. Ceftriaxone, <b>cefotaxime,</b> and ceftazidime have failed even more often, despite the organism's susceptibility to the antibiotic in vitro. Several reports have documented failure of cephamycin therapy as a result of resistance due to porin loss. Some patients have responded to aminoglycoside or quinolone therapy, but, in a recent comparison of ciprofloxacin and imipenem for bacteremia involving an ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, imipenem produced the better outcome ...|$|E
2500|$|Among Gram-negative bacteria, the {{emergence}} of resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins {{has been a major}} concern. It appeared initially in a limited number of bacterial species (C. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, and P. aeruginosa) that could mutate to hyperproduce their chromosomal class C β-lactamase. A few years later, resistance appeared in bacterial species not naturally producing AmpC enzymes (K. pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., P. mirabilis) due to the production of TEM- or SHV-type ESBLs. Characteristically, such resistance has included oxyimino- (for example ceftizoxime, <b>cefotaxime,</b> ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime, as well as the oxyimino-monobactam aztreonam), but not 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins [...] (cephamycins; in other words, cefoxitin and cefotetan); has been blocked by inhibitors such as clavulanate, sulbactam, or tazobactam, and did not involve carbapenems and temocillin. Chromosomal-mediated AmpC β-lactamases represent a new threat, since they confer resistance to 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins (cephamycins) such as cefoxitin or cefotetan are not affected by commercially available β-lactamase inhibitors, and can, in strains with loss of outer membrane porins, provide resistance to carbapenems.|$|E
2500|$|The {{commonly}} quoted {{figure of}} 10% {{of patients with}} allergic hypersensitivity to penicillins and/or carbapenems also having cross-reactivity with cephalosporins originated from a 1975 study looking at the original cephalosporins, and subsequent [...] "safety first" [...] policy meant this was widely quoted and assumed to apply to {{all members of the}} group. Hence, it was commonly stated that they are contraindicated in patients with a history of severe, immediate allergic reactions (urticaria, anaphylaxis, interstitial nephritis, etc.) to penicillins, carbapenems, or cephalosporins. [...] This, however, should be viewed in the light of recent epidemiological work suggesting, for many second-generation (or later) cephalosporins, the cross-reactivity rate with penicillin is much lower, having no significantly increased risk of reactivity over the first generation based on the studies examined. The British National Formulary previously issued blanket warnings of 10% cross-reactivity, but, since the September 2008 edition, suggests, in the absence of suitable alternatives, oral cefixime or cefuroxime and injectable <b>cefotaxime,</b> ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone can be used with caution, but the use of cefaclor, cefadrocil, cefalexin, and cefradine should be avoided.|$|E
2500|$|OXA beta-lactamases {{were long}} {{recognized}} as a less common but also plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase variety that could hydrolyze oxacillin and related anti-staphylococcal penicillins. These beta-lactamases differ from the TEM and SHV enzymes in that they belong to molecular class D and functional group 2d [...] The OXA-type beta-lactamases confer resistance to ampicillin and cephalothin and are characterized by their high hydrolytic activity against oxacillin and cloxacillin {{and the fact that}} they are poorly inhibited by clavulanic acid. Amino acid substitutions in OXA enzymes can also give the ESBL phenotype. While most ESBLs have been found in E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and other Enterobacteriaceae, the OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in P. aeruginosa. OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from Turkey and France. The OXA beta-lactamase family was originally created as a phenotypic rather than a genotypic group for a few beta-lactamases that had a specific hydrolysis profile. Therefore, there is as little as 20% sequence homology among some of the members of this family. However, recent additions to this family show some degree of homology to one or more of the existing members of the OXA beta-lactamase family. Some confer resistance predominantly to ceftazidime, but OXA-17 confers greater resistance to <b>cefotaxime</b> and cefepime than it does resistance to ceftazidime.|$|E
2500|$|Members of {{the family}} {{commonly}} express plasmid-encoded β-lactamases (e.g., TEM-1, TEM-2, and SHV-1). which confer resistance to penicillins but not to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. In the mid-1980s, {{a new group of}} enzymes, the extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), was detected (first detected in 1979). The prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria have been gradually increasing in acute care hospitals. ESBLs are beta-lactamases that hydrolyze extended-spectrum cephalosporins with an oxyimino side chain. These cephalosporins include <b>cefotaxime,</b> ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime, as well as the oxyimino-monobactam aztreonam. Thus ESBLs confer multi-resistance to these antibiotics and related oxyimino-beta lactams. In typical circumstances, they derive from genes for TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1 by mutations that alter the amino acid configuration around the active site of these β-lactamases. [...] A broader set of β-lactam antibiotics are susceptible to hydrolysis by these enzymes. An increasing number of ESBLs not of TEM or SHV lineage have recently been described. [...] The ESBLs are frequently plasmid encoded. Plasmids responsible for ESBL production frequently carry genes encoding resistance to other drug classes (for example, aminoglycosides). Therefore, antibiotic options in the treatment of ESBL-producing organisms are extremely limited. Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections due to ESBL-producing organisms, yet carbapenem-resistant (primarily ertapenem resistant) isolates have recently been reported. [...] ESBL-producing organisms may appear susceptible to some extended-spectrum cephalosporins. [...] However, treatment with such antibiotics has been associated with high failure rates.|$|E
2500|$|If all {{mutations}} are additive, {{they can}} be acquired in any order and still give a continuous uphill trajectory. The landscape is perfectly smooth, with only one peak (global maximum) and all sequences can evolve uphill to it by the accumulation of beneficial mutations in any order. Conversely, if mutations {{interact with one another}} by epistasis, the fitness landscape becomes rugged as the effect of a mutation depends on the genetic background of other mutations. At its most extreme, interactions are so complex that the fitness is ‘uncorrelated’ with gene sequence and the topology of the landscape is random. This is referred to as a rugged fitness landscape and has profound implications for the evolutionary optimisation of organisms. If mutations are deleterious in one combination but beneficial in another, the fittest genotypes can only be accessed by accumulating mutations in one specific order. This makes it more likely that organisms will get stuck at local maxima in the fitness landscape having acquired mutations in the 'wrong' order. [...] For example, a variant of TEM1 β-lactamase with 5 mutations is able to cleave <b>cefotaxime</b> (a third generation antibiotic). However, of the 120 possible pathways to this 5-mutant variant, only 7% are accessible to evolution as the remainder passed through fitness valleys where the combination of mutations reduces activity. In contrast, changes in environment (and therefore the shape of the fitness landscape) have been shown to provide escape from local maxima. In this example, selection in changing antibiotic environments resulted in a [...] "gateway mutation" [...] which epistatically interacted in a positive manner with other mutations along an evolutionary pathway, effectively crossing a fitness valley. This gateway mutation alleviated the negative epistatic interactions of other individually beneficial mutations, allowing them to better function in concert. Complex environments or selections may therefore bypass local maxima found in models assuming simple positive selection.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>cefotaxime</b> has {{demonstrated}} efficacy in these infections, {{it is not}} necessarily considered to be the first-line agent. In meningitis, <b>cefotaxime</b> crosses the blood-brain barrier better than cefuroxime.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cefotaxime</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in patients}} with a known hypersensitivity to <b>cefotaxime</b> or other cephalosporins.

5000|$|Historically, <b>cefotaxime</b> {{has been}} {{considered}} to be comparable to ceftriaxone (another third-generation cephalosporin) in safety and efficacy {{for the treatment of}} bacterial meningitis, lower respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, genitourinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections, as well as prophylaxis for abdominal surgery. The majority of these infections are caused by organisms traditionally sensitive to both cephalosporins. However, ceftriaxone has the advantage of once-daily dosing, whereas the shorter half-life of <b>cefotaxime</b> necessitates two or three daily doses for efficacy. Changing patterns in microbial resistance suggest <b>cefotaxime</b> may be suffering greater resistance than ceftriaxone, whereas the two were previously considered comparable. [...] Considering regional microbial sensitivities is also important when choosing any antimicrobial agent for the treatment of infection.|$|E
50|$|Effective {{antibiotics}} include penicillin G, ampicillin, amoxicillin and doxycycline. In {{more severe}} cases <b>cefotaxime</b> or ceftriaxone should be preferred.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike β-lactams such as {{penicillin}} and amoxicillin, {{which are}} highly susceptible to degradation by β-lactamase enzymes (produced, for example, nearly universally by S. aureus), <b>cefotaxime</b> boasts the additional benefit {{of resistance to}} β-lactamase degradation due to the structural configuration of the <b>cefotaxime</b> molecule.

50|$|Where {{resistance}} is uncommon, {{the treatment of}} choice is a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. Otherwise, a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone or <b>cefotaxime</b> is the first choice. Cefixime is a suitable oral alternative.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to their native reaction, many enzymes perform side reactions. Similarly, binding proteins may spend some proportion of their time bound to off-target proteins. These reactions or interactions may be of no consequence to current fitness but under altered conditions, may provide {{the starting point for}} adaptive evolution. For example, several mutations in the antibiotic resistance gene B-lactamase introduce <b>cefotaxime</b> resistance but do not affect ampicillin resistance. In populations exposed only to ampicillin, such mutations may be present in a minority of members since there is not fitness cost (i.e. are within the neutral network).
