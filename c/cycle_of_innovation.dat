40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{development}} and uptake of an emerging infrastructural technology: the mobile Wireless Broadband technology and service known as WiBro in South Korea, and Mobile WiMAX internationally. WiBro has emerged through a national development effort since the early 2000 s. The commercial service was launched in 2006. However, uptake fell far below initial expectations, only succeeding in niche markets. This study was motivated by concerns about the perceived gulf between development and diffusion and the ‘failure’ of WiBro. However, this study seeks to go beyond the technology-driven perspective that informs conceptions of diffusion gap: it aims to explicate the sociotechnical factors leading to such a gap. This study draws on Science and Technology Studies (STS) and in particular the Social Shaping of Technology (SST) perspective, which provides tools to scrutinize the interactions among the various interests and factors involved in the process <b>of</b> technological <b>innovation.</b> The SST perspective goes beyond approaches that treat technology as a static object to be developed and diffused. It provides tools to examine the complex and dynamic forces that develop technical capacity towards particular forms and uses. The ‘social learning’ perspective extends SST and provides concepts to explore the changing dynamics over multiple <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>innovation.</b> Here, Jørgensen’s concept of ‘development arena’ helps examine the interlinked, yet dispersed and multiple spaces in which differing goals, motivations and strategies <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> players together shape technological innovation. Through comprehensive analyses of a longitudinal study of WiBro, a broader view of the process and the outcomes <b>of</b> technological <b>innovation</b> have been achieved. Rather than viewing the technology as a stable object that would progress in a linear manner through the stages of design, development, and diffusion, it has focused on the process of shaping of WiBro through multiple <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>innovation.</b> Several arenas <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> were identified as diverse players sought to align their interests towards exploiting the resources, capacities, and tools for innovation that seemed to be available. In these spaces, conflicting and yet coevolving dynamics were observed: one involving coordination through alignments of multiple interests, and the other incorporating tensions and misalignments among the differing concerns, aims and commitments towards the innovation. The complex dynamics involved a multi-level game where the collective actions among the innovation players and their individual strategies diverged to a degree. Furthermore, changing contingencies, linked to shifting choices <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> players, resulted in the deviation <b>of</b> the <b>innovation</b> from the initial visions and aims. The study thus illustrates the outcomes of highly divergent interactions at play in innovation process and the mutual enrollment efforts of players that constituted the distributed governance <b>of</b> <b>innovation.</b> Here the complex interplays among the innovation players involved in multi-level games produced a gap between the generic vision and the actual uptake of WiBro. Changing contingencies, especially linked to broader and evolving structures and relations - brought about the reshaping of the generic vision of WiBro. This research therefore suggests the concept of the ‘distributed governance of innovation’ as a new mode for governance: that accommodates not only differing knowledges and interests but also the shifting choices and visions through the various <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> technological <b>innovation.</b> The boundary <b>of</b> social learning is thus extended to incorporate diverging choices over time and across the multiple spaces <b>of</b> <b>innovation.</b> Its implications for policy include achieving reflexivity by incorporating into the policy framework the learning process that takes place as the innovation players go through the varying stages and <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> technological <b>innovation...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the nature of}} entrepreneurship {{and its relation to}} innovation along a cycle in which exploration and exploration follow upon each other. We place the roles of entrepreneurship in innovation policy within this <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>innovation.</b> Different types of innovation along the <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> are realized with different forms of entrepreneurship, which are constrained or enabled by different legal institutions. One of the key roles of governments is to design, change or destruct institutions in order to improve societal welfare. The question is what governments should do in the context of innovation policy. Here, social scientists can make a contribution by providing insight into what entrepreneurship and innovation is (theories about these phenomena), and how institutions affect them in reality (empirical evidence about their effects). This requires social scientists to be engaged scholars and to provide new policy options as an honest broker between the academic world and the policy world. The key question of this paper is: How can policy best enable innovation based entrepreneurship? The answer is derived from looking at both theoretical tenets and empirical evidence using an institutional design perspective, which aims at providing arguments for the design, change and/or destruction of institutions, given the goals of the governments. We provide an overview of some (empirically tests of) institutions that enable or restrain particular types of entrepreneurship. Examples of these institutions are intellectual property rights and the Small Business Innovation Research program, employment protection, and non-compete covenants. entrepreneurship, innovation, institutions, innovation policy...|$|E

30|$|First, to {{incorporate}} the entire system, Dougherty (2016) suggests a way to unpack the complexity without obscuring the inherent interdependencies among activities. Rather than chop complex problems into separate bits {{to be worked on}} separately, complex systems require that four entire problem-setting and problem-solving <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> be worked on simultaneously and continuously. These four problem cycles are: projects – working on the innovation project (which, like curing cancer, are enormous, global networks); processes – continually integrating diverse emergent sciences to support projects; strategies – experimenting with value creating opportunities that map far into the future; and institutions – generating collaborative commons. Second, to encompass ambiguities, Dunne and Dougherty (2016) develop abductive reasoning to work on all these problems. Third, to address long term emergence and mustering the requisite staying power to persist and learn despite short term pressures, Dougherty et al. (2013) develop a way to leverage diverse temporal structures (kairos along with chronos) to leverage emergent knowing and gauge progress over the very long term.|$|R

In this understanding, the real innovation process is completed with the first economic use and the associated transition from the development <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> a product or process to its market cycle. The market <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> an <b>innovation</b> can be divided into innovation diffusion and adoption. Under diffusion, an early communication <b>of</b> the <b>innovation</b> is understood (i.e. in the model of Rogers (1995)) followed by the physical diffusion <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> in the market. Diffusion includes both the diffusion <b>of</b> an <b>innovation</b> geographically as well as within specific industries or markets (OECD, Eurostat 1997). Adoption <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> by the user means actual use (Rogers 1995). This is not to be equated with the innovation’s general and permanent application; rather, users can disregard <b>innovation</b> because <b>of</b> unfulfilled expectations, substitution technologies or other reasons connected with further use of the technology. In the mid-twentieth century, a view predominated that innovation is entirely due to technological breakthroughs that will automatically generate demand (the technology push approach).
