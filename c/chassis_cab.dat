5|$|The 1980s were {{challenging}} for Holden and the Australian automotive industry. The Australian Government tried {{to revive the}} industry with the Button car plan, which encouraged car makers to focus on producing fewer models at higher, more economical volumes, and to export cars. The decade opened with the shut-down of the Pagewood, New South Wales production plant and introduction of the light commercial Rodeo, sourced from Isuzu in Japan. The Rodeo was available in both two- and four-wheel drive <b>chassis</b> <b>cab</b> models {{with a choice of}} petrol and diesel powerplants. The range was updated in 1988 with the TF series, based on the Isuzu TF. Other cars sourced from Isuzu during the 1980s were the four-wheel drive Jackaroo (1981), the Shuttle (1982) van and the Piazza (1986) three-door sports hatchback. The second generation Holden Gemini from 1985 was also based on an Isuzu design, although, its manufacture was undertaken in Australia.|$|E

2500|$|Replacing the M880/M890 series, the CUCV {{represented}} General Motors' {{first major}} light-truck military vehicle production since World War II. GM CUCVs were assembled mostly from existing heavy duty light commercial truck parts. The CUCVs came in four basic body styles: pickup, utility, ambulance body and <b>chassis</b> <b>cab.</b> The M1008 was the basic cargo truck, the M1010 was the ambulance, and the M1009 and later year model M1008 ¾-ton utility rig was a Chevrolet K5 Blazer uprated to ¾-ton capacity. With {{the exception of}} the M1009, the trucks were all rated as 1 ton (commonly called a [...] "five-quarter"), even though some of them had payloads in excess of that. There were heavier-duty variants, including the M1028, M1028A1, M1028A2 and M1028A3 shelter carriers (the shelter being a mobile command, communications or intelligence operations enclosure). The M1031 was the <b>chassis</b> <b>cab.</b> These latter trucks were all rated for heavier [...] or [...] loads, compared to the M1008s [...] load capacity. The M1028A2 (converted M1031 or m1028a1) and m1028A3 (converted M1028) models had dual rear wheels. Many M1028s were upgraded at the company level to M1028A2 and A3 specs—the dual wheel rear end arrangement was a result of the M1028 flipping on its side because of the high center of gravity when carrying equipment shelters.|$|E

2500|$|The British {{police have}} used Land Rovers (including the Defender) in their service for many years, they are {{supplied}} {{with the entire}} range from Land Rover itself. Due to the ongoing terrorist threat and proliferation of public order disturbances, the Police Service of Northern Ireland has employed armoured and hardened versions of the Land Rover Defender for over 40 years in various guises. The current PSNI armoured public order vehicle is based upon a heavy duty Defender 110 chassis which starts life as a <b>chassis</b> <b>cab</b> and which is then stripped of the original body and fitted with upgraded suspension, brakes, and drive train.
