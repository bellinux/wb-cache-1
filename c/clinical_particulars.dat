40|$|Background: Due to high {{prevalence}} of multiple sclerosis among {{women of childbearing}} age, special {{attention is paid to}} the problems of pregnancy management in such patients. Aim: To study <b>clinical</b> <b>particulars</b> of the course of pregnancy, delivery and postpartum period in patients with multiple sclerosis. Materials and methods: Eighty seven pregnant women with multiple sclerosis were followed up. Forty eight patients were taking disease modifying therapies (DMT), among them, 27 patients were taking glatiramer acetate, 17, interferon beta, 2, cladribine and 2, mitoxantrone. Thirty nine patients received no DMT. We evaluated the number and time to exacerbations; <b>clinical</b> <b>particulars</b> of the course of pregnancies and deliveries were studied depending on previous treatment with immune modulators. Results: The rate of exacerbations during pregnancy decreased by 47. 7 % and increased by 12. 4 % in the postpartum period, compared to this parameter in the year before pregnancy. Most often, the attacks occurred in the first trimester (54. 5 %, р < 0. 05) and in the first 6 months after delivery (40. 1 %, p < 0. 05). A long remission before the pregnancy (2 years and more, р < 0. 01), the use of the 1 st line DMT just before conception (p < 0. 01) and multiple pregnancies (р < 0. 001) were all predictors of the reduced number of postpartum exacerbations of the disease. Pregnancy and delivery did not significantly affect the degree of neurological deficiency (mean EDSS at the postpartum period increased by 0. 05 ± 0. 01). Conclusion: Multiple sclerosis and the use of DMT are not contraindications to pregnancy and delivery. Management of pregnancies and deliveries in multiple sclerosis patients does not differ from that in the general population. Previous use of DMT decreased the number of exacerbations during pregnancy and postpartum. Health status of the newborns, the numbers of complications during pregnancy and delivery, as well as changes in EDSS in the patients did not depend on previous DMT and on the time of its cessation. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{association}} of the four following congenital abnormalities-ectodermal dysplasia affecting the hair, teeth and nails; polydactyly; chondro-dysplasia; and congenital morbus cordis-has been observed in two children in whom the clinical picture is so strikingly similar as to justify its description as a separate syndrome. Although many atypical cases of achondroplasia and chondro-osteo-dystrophy have been recorded with associated abnormalities, {{and there is an}} extensive literature relating to congenital ectodermal dysplasia, we have found no detailed description of the syndrome previously published. McIntosh (1933), however, in the tenth edition of ' Diseases of Infancy and Childhood ' includes illustrations and some <b>clinical</b> <b>particulars</b> of a child who is clearly an incomplete example of the same syndrome.

40|$|Introduction: Cerebral {{function}} monitoring (CFM) is {{a simplified}} EEG device {{that is used}} to monitor cerebral function at the cot-side. Various studies have shown its value in detecting neonatal encephalopathy and electrographic seizures, prognostication of neonatal cerebral insults, assessment of response to anticonvulsant therapy and in selecting encephalopathic infants for therapeutic hypothermia. This paper describes our preliminary experience with this monitoring device at Mater Dei Hospital, and a draft of a protocol for its clinical application. Methods: Fourteen recordings were performed on neurologically normal and abnormal term neonates. The quality of the records and their correlation with other imaging and standard EEG findings was assessed. A dataset including technical and <b>clinical</b> <b>particulars</b> of these cases was then compiled, analyzed and discussed. Results: Amplitude aEEG traces were recorded from a total of 14 patients, 4 of whom were normal term or near term infants, and 10 were infants with a neurological abnormality. All records were of satisfactory quality, and all showed very high impedance levels. Five out of 11 neurologically-abnormal patients had signs of seizure activity on CFM. A technical fault caused high impedance level in the first 2 traces. Annotations were generally lacking. Five out of 10 infants with CNS problems had clinical seizures of which 4 had electrographic seizures on CFM, 4 had electrographic seizures on formal EEG, and 3 had abnormal MRI findings. Conclusion: Our local experience has confirmed the usefulness of CFM monitoring in the setting of a neonatal intensive care unit. Despite some initial problems with high impedance levels and electrode attachment, the tracings obtained were reproducible and of good quality. Almost half of the neurologically-abnormal neonates showed signs of seizure activity on CFM with good correlation with clinical and standard EEG. The timely diagnosis enabled the clinicians to confirm seizure activity, initiate anticonvulsant therapy and monitor the response. Staff training is vital in order to improve utilisation of CFM in neonatal practice...|$|E
