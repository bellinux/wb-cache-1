40|$|Whether colostral leukocytes (CLs) of vaccinated dams {{influence}} the immune response of neonatal calves following vaccination against the same antigen as their respective dams remains unanswered. Therefore, {{we compared the}} induction of humoral and cellular immune responses after vaccination in calves that had received CL-free or maternal CL-enriched colostrum from a cell-free <b>colostrum</b> <b>bank</b> of nonvaccinated cows. Also, vaccinated calves that had received fresh maternal colostrum from their own dam {{were included in the}} study. Moreover, we analyzed whether the post-partum time of priming vaccination (day 2, 5 or 10) of the calves could {{influence the}} outcome of the immune responses. All calves received a booster vaccination 23 days after the priming vaccination. All calves showed only an increase in tetanus toxoid (TT) -specific antibodies and TT-induced proliferation after booster vaccination. Tetanus toxoid-specific antibody responses in calves increased immediately after booster vaccination, irrespective of whether or not their cell-free bank colostrum had been enriched with CLs from their own dam. Conversely, calves receiving their own plain dam colostrum displayed a later humoral response, due to colostral antibodies. After booster vaccination, calves of the CL-enriched colostrum group had a more pronounced antigen-specific proliferative response than the calves of the CL-free colostrum group. We propose that CLs might have a suppressive influence on the emergence of the TT-specific antibodies, but an enhancing effect on the TT-specific lymphocyte proliferation of newborn calves upon TT vaccination, which is dependent on the time point of the priming vaccination. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} bovine colostrum, {{including}} its thermally labile compounds, on the survival and growth performance of local breed piglets reared by their mother, in Benin, was evaluated over a 49 -day trial. Three groups of 16 piglets, stemming from two primiparous sows {{belonging to a}} unique traditional farm, were respectively fed for the first 48 h of life with either bovine colostrum heated to 85 °C for 30 min, or thawed bovine colostrum, or colostrum from the mother. Thereafter, the animals that received bovine colostrum turned back to their mother. At day 21, almost all piglets from the group that received heated colostrum died. The highest total weight gain was obtained in the group that received thawed bovine colostrum (P[*]˂[*] 0. 01), followed by the group left with the mother. Corresponding average daily gains (ADGs) were 56, 34 and 2 g/day, respectively (P[*]˂[*] 0. 05). At {{the end of the}} trial, the treatment effect was highly significant on the survival of piglets (100 % in the thawed colostrum group vs. 00 and 50 %, respectively, in the heated colostrum group and in the group left with the mother). At day 49, numerically higher weight and ADGs were obtained in the group that received thawed cow colostrum. Thawed bovine colostrum improved the growth performance and piglet survival in the local pig breed in Benin, probably owing to thermally labile components. Bovine colostrum may be used in our farms in order to reduce pre-weaning mortality, improve the profitability of livestock farmers, and ensure survival of traditional farms. The use of bovine colostrum on farms could be facilitated by collaboration between pig farmers and bovine farmers. It could also be facilitated by the creation of a <b>colostrum</b> <b>bank.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Passive {{immunity}} transfer {{failure is}} the most important cause of septicemia in the newborn foal. Good quality colostrum contains not less than 60 g Ig/L and low quality one less than 38 g/L. Levels normally in accordance with the foal protection are over 800 mg/dL IgG serum concentration at 18 - 24 hours from first suckling, when colostrum is ingested under optimal conditions (1. 5 - 2 litres within 6 hours from delivery). Aim of this work was to measure growing evolution by morphological traits, APGAR test and haemochrome evaluation in two thoroughbred foal groups from the same breeding with different serum IgG level concentration. IgG serum concentration from 74 foals at 18 - 24 hours from first suckling and at 21 days of age was determined by semiquantitative Elisa test kits. Morphological traits (body weight, whiters height, chest and shin measurement), daily gain, APGAR test and haemochrome (RBC, WBC, Hb, PCV, PLT) were evaluated from 1 to 6 months of age and differences between A and B groups were statistically evaluated by JMP 8. In 70 foals (A group), 94. 3 %, IgG amounts were over 800 mg/dL, in 4 foals (B group), 5. 7 %, IgG levels were lower than 400 mg/dL. 1 litre colostrum per os from internal <b>colostrum</b> <b>bank</b> and parenteral immune serum (Plasmalife, Siena) were administered to B group foals. Body weight differences were statistically significant between A and B (266. 48 kg vs 259. 25 kg) at 6 months. No differences were observed between other morphological traits. 97. 3 % foals was APGAR test as 7 - 8. 2. 3 % was 6 (1 from B group, 0 from A group). No statistically significant differences were observed between RBC, WBC, Hb, PCV, PLT at 21 days test. The enlightenment to breeders about the incidence and high risk of passive immunization failure by foals should be intensified. At the same time we confirm that early and specific interventions as excellent colostrum supplementation and specific hyper-immune serum administration might prevent failure of immunity passive transfer...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the nutritional and microbiological composition of colostrum samples collected from <b>colostrum</b> <b>banks</b> or newly calved cows on dairy farms. For this purpose, 66 colostrum samples from dairy cows were directly collected during the milking of newly calved cows or from <b>colostrum</b> storage <b>bank.</b> Samples were collected from commercial properties in the states of Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Paraná - Brazil, which were classified according to the total daily milk yield (MY). Even though average immunoglobulin concentrations were either adequate (79. 7 and 51. 7 mg/mL, for farms with MY> 701 L/d and < 200 L/d, respectively) or marginal (48. 1 mg/mL for MY between 201 - 700 L/d), for only 48. 4 % of the colostrum samples, immunoglobulin concentrations were greater than 50 mg/mL. A variety of factors such as production system, animal breed, and time of sample collection can also affect the variables studied. In addition to emphasizing nutrition, good hygiene practices during the colostrum collection and storage process also deserve attention, since 24 % of colostrum samples were below the microbial quality parameters. When nutritional and microbiological quality were simultaneously analyzed, only 22. 6 % of colostrum samples met the recommendations. Therefore, most of the calves in this region of Brazil are likely to present failure of passive immunity transfer and are exposed to pathogens when fed maternal colostrum...|$|R
40|$|Colostrum {{and milk}} are complex mammary {{secretions}} providing the puppy with many nutritional and immunological factors, which {{play a crucial}} role for its correct development and survival. In the case of colostrum and/or milk intake deficiency, puppies are at increased risk of infectious diseases. This work reviews the various nutritional hyperimmune supplementations proposed to provide a passive immune protection and to positively impact puppies' health. Some strategies rely on canine immunoglobulins: canine <b>colostrum</b> <b>banking</b> and canine serum/plasma supplementation. Others involve heterologous sources of antibodies and other immune factors: bovine colostrum or hyperimmune egg powder. Among the different solutions evaluated from birth to weaning, canine plasma and hyperimmune egg powder showed promising beneficial effect on puppies' health. Canine plasma seems to positively impact not only growth (increased growth during the neonatal period), but also digestive health (higher species richness of intestinal microbiota) and the general health (tendency of lower morbidity). Puppies supplemented with hyperimmune egg powder presented increased neonatal growth and decreased risk of canine parvovirus infection. Nevertheless, natural canine maternal colostrum and milk ingestion remains the optimal guarantee for puppies' health and survival, as a source of immunity, energy and growth factors...|$|R
