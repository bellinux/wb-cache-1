40|$|Bohr's dictum "Physical {{phenomena}} {{are observed}} relative to different experimental setups" {{is applied to}} a set of <b>binary</b> <b>elements</b> that represent the smallest units of information. A description relative to "macroscopic" setups of such elements is formulated. This requires the introduction of a Hilbert space formalism. It is shown, that the Hilbert space is symmetric with respect to the de Sitter group SO(3, 2). For macroscopic setups SO(3, 2) is approximated by the Poincare group. A space-time manifold is obtained that expresses the orientation of macroscopic setups relative to each other. Individual <b>binary</b> <b>elements</b> can then be given a "position" relative to macroscopic reference frames. To an observer <b>binary</b> <b>elements</b> will then exhibit properties of massive particles. This informational approach to particle physics determines a mass scale, delivers interaction terms for all four interactions and is, in principle, capable of fixing coupling constants and masses. Despite its simplicity it forms a promising basis for a theoretical model that leads beyond the standard model.

40|$|A new metaheuristic called {{estimation}} of distribution algorithm using correlation between <b>binary</b> <b>elements</b> (EDACE) is proposed. The method searches for optima using a binary string {{to represent a}} design solution. A matrix for correlation between <b>binary</b> <b>elements</b> of a design solution is used to represent a binary population. Optimisation search is achieved by iteratively updating such a matrix. The performance assessment is conducted by comparing the new algorithm with existing binary-code metaheuristics including a genetic algorithm, a univariate marginal distribution algorithm, population-based incremental learning, binary particle swarm optimisation, and binary simulated annealing by using the test problems of CEC 2015 competition and one real-world application which is an optimal flight control problem.

40|$|Inspired by Bohr's dictum that "physical {{phenomena}} {{are observed}} relative to different experimental setups", this article investigates {{the notion of}} relativity in Bohr's sense, starting from a set of <b>binary</b> <b>elements.</b> The most general form of information coding within such sets requires a description by four-component states. By using Bohr's dictum as a guideline a quantum mechanical description of the set is obtained {{in the form of}} a SO(3, 2) based spin network. For large (macroscopic) sub-networks a flat-space approximation of SO(3, 2) leads to a Poincare symmetrical Hilbert space. The concept of a position of four-component spinors relative to macroscopic sub-networks then delivers the description of 'free' massive spin- 1 / 2 particles with a Poincare symmetrical Hilbert space. Hence Minkowskian space-time, equipped with spin- 1 / 2 particles, is obtained as an inherent property of a system of <b>binary</b> <b>elements</b> when individual elements are described relative to macroscopic sub-systems.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We use a MRF with {{asymmetric}} pairwise compatibility constraints between direct pixel {{neighbors to}} solve a constrained binary image segmentation task. The model is constraining shape and alignment of individual <b>contiguous</b> <b>binary</b> segments by introducing auxiliary labels and their pairwise interactions. Such representation is not necessarily unique. We study several ad-hoc labeling models for binary images consisting of non-overlapping rectangular contiguous regions. Nesting and equivalence of these models are studied. We observed a noticeable increase in performance even in cases when {{the differences between the}} models were seemingly insignificant. We use the proposed models for segmentation of windowpanes and windows in orthographically rectified façade images. Segmented window patches are always axis-parallel non-overlapping rectangles which must also be aligned in our strongest model. We show experimentally that even very weak data model in the MAP formulation of the optimal segmentation problem gives very good segmentation results. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of randomly connected networks composed of <b>binary</b> Boolean <b>elements</b> and those composed of <b>binary</b> majority vote <b>elements.</b> We elucidate their differences in both sparsely and densely connected cases. The quickness of large network dynamics is usually quantified by the length of transient paths, an analytically intractable measure. For discrete-time dynamics of networks of <b>binary</b> <b>elements,</b> we address this dilemma with an alternative unified framework by using a concept termed state concentration, defined as the exponent of {{the average number of}} t-step ancestors in state transition graphs. The state transition graph is defined by nodes corresponding to network states and directed links corresponding to transitions. Using this exponent, we interrogate {{the dynamics of}} random Boolean and majority vote networks. We find that extremely sparse Boolean networks and majority vote networks with arbitrary density achieve quickness, owing in part to long-tailed in-degree distributions. As a corollary, only relatively dense majority vote networks can achieve both quickness and robustness. Comment: 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|With the {{development}} of optical technology, optical instruments become smaller and more integrated.

But the diffraction efficiency of <b>binary</b> optical <b>elements</b> will decrease quickly with the change of wavelength. And this situation will have big impact on image quality. Since double-layer BOE can blaze at two wavelengths, it has high diffraction efficiency at wide spectral bandwidth. There are kinds of fabrication errors. Based on scalar diffraction theory, this paper analyzes the diffraction efficiency of double-layer BOE with fabrication errors and simulates it in MATLAB. Simulation shows the diffraction efficiency decreases quickly if the depth errors of two layers are opposite, and this situation should avoid. As for periodic errors, tilt errors and angular errors, these fabrication errors have different impact of double-layer BOE on diffraction efficiency. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe report {{here on the}} {{theoretical}} performance of blazed <b>binary</b> diffractive <b>elements</b> composed of pillars carefully arranged on a two-dimensional grid whose period is smaller than the structural cutoff. These diffractive elements operate under unpolarized light. For a given grating geometry, the structural cutoff is a period value above which the grating no longer behaves like a homogeneous thin film. Because the grid period is smaller than this value, effective-medium theories can be fully exploited for the design, and straightforward procedures are obtained. The theoretical performance of the blazed <b>binary</b> <b>elements</b> is investigated through electromagnetic theories. It is found that these elements substantially outperform standard blazed échelette diffractive elements in the resonance domain. The increase in efficiency is explained by a decrease of the shadowing effect and by an unexpected sampling effect. The theoretical analysis is confirmed by experimental evidence obtained for a 3 λ-period prismlike grating operating at 633 nm and for a 20 °-off-axis diffractive lens operating at 860 nm...|$|R
