25|$|Hickories sprout readily from stumps and roots. Stump {{sprouting}} {{is not as}} prolific as {{in other}} deciduous trees species but the sprouts that are produced are vigorous and grow fairly rapidly in height. Root sprouts also are vigorous and probably more numerous than stump sprouts in <b>cut-over</b> areas. Small stumps sprout more frequently than large ones. Sprouts that originate at or below ground level and from small stumps {{are less likely to}} develop heartwood decay. Pignut hickory is difficult to reproduce from cuttings.|$|E
25|$|By 1938, an {{estimated}} 20 woodpeckers {{remained in the}} wild, some six to eight of which were in the old-growth forest called the Singer Tract, owned by the Singer Sewing Company in Madison Parish in northeastern Louisiana, where logging rights were held by the Chicago Mill and Lumber Company. The company brushed aside pleas from four Southern governors and the National Audubon Society that the tract be publicly purchased and set aside as a reserve. By 1944, the last known ivory-billed woodpecker, a female, was gone from the <b>cut-over</b> tract.|$|E
25|$|They {{located the}} village {{on a high}} grassy meadow where a logging company may have {{previously}} grazed its livestock, {{in an area where}} settlers were scarce. Nearby were large marshes where they caught muskrats to eat. Deer and other game were probably plentiful in the surrounding <b>cut-over.</b> They pulled earth up into raised garden beds and planted corn, onions, beans, squash and potatoes. They gathered wild ginseng in the woods, and in spring they tapped sugar maples and made syrup. Some lived in log cabins, others probably in more traditional structures.|$|E
2500|$|The biomass-is-carbon-neutral {{proposal}} {{put forward}} in the early 1990s has been superseded by more recent science that recognizes that mature, intact forests sequester carbon more effectively than <b>cut-over</b> areas. When a tree's carbon is released into the atmosphere in a single pulse, it contributes to climate change much more than woodland timber rotting slowly over decades. Current studies indicate that [...] "even after 50 years the forest has not recovered to its initial carbon storage" [...] and [...] "the optimal strategy {{is likely to be}} protection of the standing forest".|$|E
2500|$|The {{effect of}} rail {{connections}} was ultimately transformative; timber {{and other goods}} could be produced {{in the north and}} shipped to urban markets to the south. Diverse industries developed, such as iron works, tanneries, mills, cement plants, and agricultural enterprises. By 1885, the intense harvesting and export of pine trees led to visible decline in the lumber industry's ability to produce white pine. Logging in Michigan peaked in 1889. Where available, hardwoods and hemlock were harvested, temporarily extending the life of lumbering in the area, especially around East Jordan, the Traverse Bay, and near Crawford County. [...] William Howard White's lumber railroad (Boyne City, Gaylord & Alpena Railroad Company), David Ward's Detroit and Charlevoix Railroad, and the East Jordan and Southern Railroad enabled access to remote timber areas. [...] As lumbering declined, rail lines began to promote Northern Michigan as a [...] "fresh air" [...] resort destination, and the logging companies promoted their <b>cut-over,</b> stump-filled tracts for their agricultural potential.|$|E
2500|$|The town's two {{parks are}} the main open spaces in the town centre. Cheetham Park was opened in June 1932 to a crowd of 15,000 people. The park was left to the town under the will of John Frederick Cheetham along with his house, Eastwood, and his {{collection}} of paintings, which now form part of the Astley Cheetham Art Gallery collection. The park is landscaped informally with large areas of woodland. Adjacent to Cheetham's Park lies the Eastwood Nature Reserve. Eastwood {{was one of the}} first reserves to be owned by the RSPB. It is managed by Cheshire Wildlife Trust. The reserve is a <b>cut-over,</b> lowland, raised mire SSSI, surrounded by a woodland fringe. Characteristic bog plants include sphagnum mosses, cotton grass and cross-leaved heath. Nine species of dragonfly and damselfly have been recorded on the reserve, along with the green hairstreak butterfly. The steep-sided broad-leaved woodland is bisected by Acres Brook and contains several old mill ponds. The geology is shale and sandstone, with a rich variety of plants and animals typical of woodland habitat on an acid soil. Access is from the A6018 Mottram Road. Car parking is available in Stalybridge Celtic FC's car park. The reserve occupies [...]|$|E
60|$|We made camp at sunset, with a flare of gold {{along the}} west, and the Peaks rising rosy and {{clear to the}} north. We camped in a <b>cut-over</b> pine forest, where stumps and lopped tops and burned deadfalls made an aspect of {{blackened}} desolation. From a distance, however, the scene was superb. At sunset there was a faint wind which soon died away.|$|E

6000|$|Luke Dawson, lender {{of money}} on mortgages, owner of Northern <b>cut-over</b> land, was a {{hesitant}} man in unpressed soft gray clothes, with bulging eyes in a milky face. His wife had bleached cheeks, bleached hair, bleached voice, and a bleached manner. She wore her expensive green frock, with its passementeried bosom, bead tassels, and gaps between the buttons down the back, {{as though she had}} bought it second-hand and was afraid of meeting the former owner. They were shy. It was [...] "Professor" [...] George Edwin Mott, superintendent of schools, a Chinese mandarin turned brown, who held Carol's hand and made her welcome.|$|E
6000|$|At length the <b>cut-over</b> land {{ended in}} a forest of straggling pines, through which the road wound southward, and {{eventually}} down into a wide shallow canyon. Through the trees Carley saw a stream of water, open fields of green, log fences and cabins, and blue smoke. She heard the chug of a gasoline engine and the baa-baa of sheep. Glenn {{waited for her to}} catch up with him, and he said: [...] "Carley, this is one of Hutter's sheep camps. It's not a--a very pleasant place. You won't care to see the sheep-dip. So I'm suggesting you wait here--" ...|$|E
6000|$|In the {{afternoon}} we reached Lake Mary, a long, ugly, muddy pond {{in a valley}} between pine-slopes. Dead and ghastly trees stood in the water, and the shores were cattle-tracked. Probably to the ranchers this mud-hole was a pleasing picture, but to me, who loved {{the beauty of the}} desert before its productiveness, it was hideous. When we passed Lake Mary, and farther on the last of the <b>cut-over</b> timber-land, we began to get into wonderful country. We traveled about sixteen miles, rather a small day's ride. Romer stayed on his horse all through that ride, and when we selected a camp site for the night he said to me: [...] "Well, you're lucky you wouldn't bet." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1896, after most pine was logged off in {{the town}} of Arthur, the Cypreanson Brothers of Eau Claire offered <b>cut-over</b> land for sale and hired Vincent Benish to {{advertise}} that land in Bohemian-language newspapers to Czech immigrants in southwest Wisconsin.|$|E
50|$|But {{the lumber}} {{companies}} sold the <b>cut-over</b> land to families and logging {{was replaced by}} farming. A cream collection station opened in Hannibal in 1915, and the Farmers Union Feed Store in 1923. A cheese factory operated there from 1924 to around 1945.|$|E
50|$|Prentice {{was founded}} on the lumber {{industry}} when the local sawmill opened in 1882. But the sawmill closed in the 1890s when the best timber ran out. Without that big industry, people wondered how little communities left in the <b>cut-over</b> would survive.|$|E

50|$|After the sawmill closed, the U.S. Leather Company's tannery ran until 1915, using local hemlock bark for its tanning process. And {{more and}} more farmers settled on the {{surrounding}} <b>cut-over</b> lands left by logging. Around 1903 a creamery in town began buying milk from them and selling butter.|$|E
50|$|Most of the Mackinaw State Forest was logged for {{red pine}} and white pine during {{the golden age}} of Michigan old-growth lumbering, which ended about 1910.

50|$|The Orokonui Valley {{was once}} part of a {{hospital}} farm. It was previously <b>cut-over</b> and grazed, and parts of it planted in Eucalyptus regnans, {{one of which is}} New Zealand's tallest measured tree. The former hospital property was divided. The agricultural land was vested in Landcorp and the major part of the land was managed as the Orokonui Conservation Area by DOC.|$|E
50|$|The Lake Superior forest {{region was}} one of the last areas in Michigan to be logged for old-growth Red Pine and White Pine. Logging {{continued}} into the 1910s. Much of the sandy, <b>cut-over</b> land was seen as worthless and was allowed to revert to the state of Michigan in lieu of unpaid property taxes. The state reorganized these parcels of property as the Lake Superior State Forest.|$|E
50|$|The village grew as {{the logging}} {{operations}} drew more workers, and the <b>cut-over</b> land was settled. A log schoolhouse {{was the first}} building built, located {{on the west side}} of the settlement. Taverns, a boarding house, general store, and a train station also soon appeared. A frame schoolhouse and post Office were built in 1911. In time, Kennedy had some basic businesses, including a hotel.|$|E
