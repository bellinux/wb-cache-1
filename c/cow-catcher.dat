The Constitutionalist Army divisions now utilized trains rather than cavalry to move men and war materiel, including their horses, {{as well as}} soldaderas. The change in technology enabled the movement of combatants, women and children, with horses and male soldiers inside box cars, with women and children on top of them. As with the Federal Army where allowing soldiers to have their wives, sweethearts, and possibly their children with them, soldiers' morale was better and the armies could retain their combatants.

60|$|We had {{a splendid}} ride. We went {{slashing}} along {{through the woods}} the whole way, and as {{neither of us had}} ever ridden on an engine before, we made the best of our time. We found out what every crank and handle was for, and kept a sharp look-out ahead, through the little windows in the cab. If we had caught an alligator on the <b>cow-catcher,</b> the thing would have been complete.

6000|$|Waving {{the lantern}} Geoffrey stood {{with a foot}} {{on one of the}} rails and every sense intent, until the first engine's <b>cow-catcher</b> was almost upon him. Then he leaped for his life and stood half-blinded amid {{whirling}} ballast and a rushing wind, as, veiled in thick dust, the great box cars clanged by. He was savage with dismay, for it seemed that the engineer had not seen his signal; then his heart bounded, a shrill hoot from two whistles was followed by the screaming of brakes. When he came up with the standing train {{at the end of the}} trestle, one engineer, leaning down from the rail of the cab, said: ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{was pushed}} forward a foot at a time; whirled backward, his rear drivers clinking and clanking, {{a quarter of}} a mile; jerked into a switch (yard-switches are very stubby and unaccommodating), bunted into a Red D, or Merchant's Transport car, and, with no hint or {{knowledge}} of the weight behind him, started up anew. When his load was fairly on the move, three or four cars would be cut off, and [...] .007 would bound forward, only to be held hiccupping on the brake. Then he would wait a few minutes, watching the whirled lanterns, deafened with the clang of the bells, giddy with the vision of the sliding cars, his brake-pump panting forty to the minute, his front coupler lying sideways on his <b>cow-catcher,</b> like a tired dog's tongue in his mouth, and the whole of him covered with half-burnt coal-dust.|$|E
60|$|Thurston {{was strong}} of limb and every muscle in him had been {{toughened}} by strenuous toil, but Leslie had struck {{his head on}} the rails and lay still, stunned and helpless. The lift was heavy for the man who strove to raise him, and though the brakes screamed along the line of cars the locomotive was almost upon them. Standing horrified, and, without power to move, the two spectators saw Geoffrey still gripping his enemy's shoulders, heave himself erect in a supreme effort, then the <b>cow-catcher</b> on the engine's front struck them both, and Savine felt, rather than heard, a sickening sound as the huge machine swept resistlessly on. Afterward he declared that the suspense which followed while the long box-cars rolled by was horrible, for nothing could be seen, and the two men shivered with the uncertainty as to what might be happening beneath the grinding wheels.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I won't. It'll {{be as much}} as I can do to {{get through}} this story, without going over any of it again. Well, the thing that the little Pony Engine wanted to be, the most in this world, was the {{locomotive}} of the Pacific Express, that starts out every afternoon at three, you know. It intended to apply for the place as soon as its <b>cow-catcher</b> was grown, and it was always trying to attract the locomotive's attention, backing and filling on the track alongside of the train; and once it raced it a little piece, and beat it, before the Express locomotive was under way, and almost got in front of it on a switch. My, but its mother was scared! She just yelled to it with her whistle; and that night she sent it to sleep without a particle of coal or water in its tender.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, never you mind," [...] {{said the}} papa to the boy. [...] "You'll be putting up your lip before I'm through. Well, {{and then she}} used to caution the little Pony Engine against {{getting in the way}} of the big locomotives, and told it to keep close round after her, and try to do all it could to learn about {{shifting}} empty cars. You see, she knew how ambitious the little Pony Engine was, and how it wasn't contented a bit just to grow up in the pony-engine business, and be tied down to the depot all its days. Once she happened to tell it that if it was good and always did what it was bid, perhaps a <b>cow-catcher</b> would grow on it some day, and then it could be a passenger locomotive. Mammas have to promise all sorts of things, and she was almost distracted when she said that." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Oakland railway terminus, whence all {{the main}} lines start, does not own {{anything}} approaching to a platform.

[...] "Well, it got away from the {{nightmare}} about morning, but not till the nightmare had bitten a large piece out of its tender, and then it braced up for the home-stretch. It thought that if it could once beat the Express to the Sierras, it could keep the start {{the rest of the}} way, for it could get over the mountains quicker than the Express could, and it might be in San Francisco before the Express got to Sacramento. The Express kept gaining on it. But it just zipped along the upper edge of Kansas and the lower edge of Nebraska, and on through Colorado and Utah and Nevada, and when it got to the Sierras it just stooped a little, and went over them like a goat; it did, truly; just doubled up its fore wheels under it, and jumped. And the Express kept gaining on it. By this time it couldn't say 'Pacific Express' any more, and it didn't try. It just said 'Express! Express!' and then ''Press! 'Press!' and then ''Ess! 'Ess!' and pretty soon only ''Ss! 'Ss!' And the Express kept gaining on it. Before they reached San Francisco, the Express locomotive's <b>cow-catcher</b> was almost touching the Pony Engine's tender; it gave one howl of anguish as it felt the Express locomotive's hot breath on the place where the nightmare had bitten the piece out, and tore {{through the end of the}} San Francisco depot, and plunged into the Pacific Ocean, and was never seen again. There, now," [...] said the papa, trying to make the children get down, [...] "that's all. Go to bed." [...] The little girl was crying, and so he tried to comfort her by keeping her in his lap.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, thanks, thanks!" [...] {{said her}} uncle. He was a tall, slender man of fifty-five or sixty, with a {{straight}} gray mustache, {{and not at all}} the typical Englishman, but much more English-looking than if he had been. His bearing toward Lydia blended a fatherly kindness and a colonial British gallantry, such as one sees in elderly Canadian gentlemen attentive to quite young Canadian ladies at the provincial watering-places. He had an air of adventure, and of uncommon pleasure and no small astonishment in Lydia's beauty. They were already good friends; she was at her ease with him; she treated {{him as if he were}} an old gentleman. At the station, where Veronica got into the same carriage with them, Lydia found the whole train very queer-looking, and he made her describe its difference from an American train. He said, [...] "Oh, yes--yes, engine," [...] when she mentioned the locomotive, and he apparently prized beyond its worth the word <b>cow-catcher,</b> a fixture which Lydia said was wanting to the European locomotive, and left it very stubby. He asked her if she would allow him to set it down; and he entered the word in his note-book, with several other idioms she had used. He said that he amused himself in picking up these things from his American friends. He wished to know what she called this and that and the other thing, and was equally pleased whether her nomenclature agreed or disagreed with his own. Where it differed, he recorded the fact, with her leave, in his book. He plied her with a thousand questions about America, with all parts of which he seemed to think her familiar; and she explained with difficulty how very little of it she had seen. He begged her not to let him bore her, and to excuse the curiosity of a Britisher, [...] "As I suppose you'd call me," [...] he added.|$|E
6000|$|The papa said, [...] "Now {{every time}} you stop me I shall have to begin all over again." [...] But he saw {{that this was not}} going to spite them any, so he went on: [...] "One of the {{locomotives}} was its mother, and she had got hurt once in a big smash-up, so that she couldn't run long trips any more. She was so weak in the chest you could hear her wheeze as far as you could see her. But she could work round the depot, and pull empty cars in and out, and shunt them off on the side tracks; and she was so anxious to be useful that all the other engines respected her, and they were very kind to the little Pony Engine on her account, though it was always getting in the way, and under their wheels, and everything. They all knew it was an orphan, for before its mother got hurt its father went through a bridge one dark night into an arm of the sea, and was never heard of again; he {{was supposed to have been}} drowned. The old mother locomotive used to say that it would never have happened if she had been there; but poor dear No. 236 was always so venturesome, and she had warned him against that very bridge time and again. Then she would whistle so dolefully, and sigh with her air-brakes enough to make anybody cry. You see they used to be a very happy family when they were all together, before the papa locomotive got drowned. He was very fond of the little Pony Engine, and told it stories at night after they got into the car-house, at the end of some of his long runs. It would get up on his <b>cow-catcher,</b> and lean its chimney up against his, and listen till it fell asleep. Then he would put it softly down, and be off again in the morning before it was awake. I tell you, those were happy days for poor No. 236. The little Pony Engine could just remember him; it was awfully proud of its papa." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{had just}} cleared the Black Cañon and another gorge, and were sailing out into open country nine {{thousand}} {{feet above the}} level of the sea, when we came most suddenly round a corner upon a causeway across a waste water--half dam and half quarry-pool. The locomotive gave one wild [...] "Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!" [...] but it was too late. He was a beautiful bull, and goodness only knows why he had chosen the track for a constitutional with his wife. She was flung to the left, but the <b>cow-catcher</b> caught him, and turning him round, heaved him shoulder deep into the pool. The expression of blank, blind bewilderment on his bovine, jovine face was wonderful to behold. He was not angry. I don't think he was even scared, though he must have flown ten yards through the air. All he wanted to know was: [...] "Will somebody have the goodness to tell a respectable old gentleman what in the world, or out of it, has occurred?" [...] And five minutes later the stream that had been snapping at our heels in the gorges split itself into a dozen silver threads on a breezy upland, and became an innocent trout beck, and we halted at a half-dead city, the name of which does not remain with me. It had originally been built on the crest of a wave of prosperity. Once ten thousand people had walked its street; but the boom had collapsed. The great brick houses and the factories were empty. The population lived in little timber shanties on the fringes of the deserted town. There were some railway workshops and things, and the hotel (whose pavement formed the platform of the railway) contained one hundred and more rooms--empty. The place, in its half-inhabitedness, was more desolate than Amber or Chitor. But a man said: [...] "Trout--six pounds--two miles away," [...] and the Sorrowful Man and myself went in search of 'em. The town was ringed by a circle of hills all alive with little thunder-storms that broke across the soft green of the plain in wisps and washes of smoke and amber.|$|E
