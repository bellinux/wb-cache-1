2500|$|Although the Kims had a {{cellular}} phone with them, their remote location in the mountains was {{out of range of}} the cellular network, rendering the phone unusable for voice calls. [...] Despite being unusable for voice calls, their cell phone would {{play a key role in}} their rescue. [...] Cell phone text messages may go through even when there appears to be no signal, in part because text messaging is a store-and-forward service. [...] Two Edge Wireless engineers, Eric Fuqua and Noah Pugsley, contacted search and rescue authorities offering their help in the search. On Saturday, December 2, they began searching through the data logs of cell sites, trying to find records of repeaters to which the Kims' cellphone may have connected. They discovered that on November 26, 2006 at around 1:30a.m., the Kims' cellphone made a brief automatic connection to a cell site near Glendale, Oregon, and retrieved two text messages. Temporary atmospheric conditions, such as tropospheric ducting, can briefly allow radio communications over larger distances than normal. Through the data logs, the engineers determined that the cell phone was in a specific area west of the <b>cellular</b> <b>tower.</b> They then used a computer program to determine which areas in the mountains were within a line-of-sight to the <b>cellular</b> <b>tower.</b> This narrowed the search area tremendously, and finally focused rescue efforts on Bear Camp Road.|$|E

40|$|Understanding mobile traffic {{patterns}} of large scale <b>cellular</b> <b>towers</b> in urban environment is extremely valuable for Internet service providers, mobile users, and government managers of modern metropolis. This paper aims at extracting and modeling the {{traffic patterns}} of large scale towers deployed in a metropolitan city. To achieve this goal, {{we need to}} address several challenges, including lack of appropriate tools for processing large scale traffic measurement data, unknown traffic patterns, as well as handling complicated factors of urban ecology and human behaviors that affect traffic patterns. Our core contribution is a powerful model which combines three dimensional information (time, locations of towers, and traffic frequency spectrum) to extract and model the traffic patterns of thousands of <b>cellular</b> <b>towers.</b> Our empirical analysis reveals the following important observations. First, only five basic time-domain traffic patterns exist among the 9, 600 <b>cellular</b> <b>towers.</b> Second, each of the extracted traffic pattern maps to one type of geographical locations related to urban ecology, including residential area, business district, transport, entertainment, and comprehensive area. Third, our frequency-domain traffic spectrum analysis suggests that the traffic of any tower among the 9, 600 can be constructed using a linear combination of four primary components corresponding to human activity behaviors. We believe that the proposed traffic patterns extraction and modeling methodology, combined with the empirical analysis on the mobile traffic, pave the way toward a deep understanding of the traffic patterns of large scale <b>cellular</b> <b>towers</b> in modern metropolis.
