60|$|There {{may be some}} inequalities in the {{practical}} application of our system. It is fair that each man shall pay taxes in exact proportion {{to the value of}} his property; but if we should wait, before <b>collecting</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax,</b> <b>to</b> adjust the <b>taxes</b> upon each man in exact proportion with every other man, we should never collect any tax at all. There may be mistakes made sometimes; and things may be done wrong, while the officers of the Government do all they can to prevent mistakes. But I beg of you, as citizens of this great Republic, not to let your minds be carried off from the great work we have before us. This struggle is too large for you to be diverted from it by any small matter. When you return to your homes, rise up to the height of a generation of men worthy of a free government, and we will carry out the great work we have commenced. I return to you my sincere thanks, soldiers, for the honor you have done me this afternoon.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the possibility that}} foreign aid financing for public capital accumulation in developing countries may lead to excess depreciation of capital. The depreciation rate on public capital is endogenised in a general equilibrium framework {{in which the government}} <b>collects</b> <b>a</b> consumption <b>tax</b> <b>to</b> finance maintenance and repair expenditures as well as public investment. Tow simple cases are formulated and analysed to show that excess depreciation of public capital may result from budgetary and international aid and financing distortions that skew allocations to new investment rather than to maintenance of existing capital...|$|R

Traditionally, the Commission selected some of its own members {{to serve on the}} WMATA Board.

50|$|There were no {{funds in}} the city's {{treasury}} out of which the judgment could be paid, and its corporate authorities refused to satisfy it, in the only {{way in which it}} can be paid, by <b>a</b> levy of <b>taxes</b> for that specific purpose. The judgment in the present action, which was commenced by a petition for mandamus, requires the City Council of Quincy to levy and <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> special <b>tax</b> sufficient <b>to</b> discharge the amount thereof with interest from the date of its rendition and also the costs of this and the former action.

25|$|All large {{businesses}} incur {{administrative costs}} {{in the process of}} delivering revenue collected from customers to the suppliers of the goods or services being purchased. Taxation is no different; the resource collected from the public through taxation is always greater than the amount which can be used by the government. The difference is called the compliance cost and includes (for example) the labour cost and other expenses incurred in complying with tax laws and rules. The collection of <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> in order <b>to</b> spend it on a specified purpose, for example <b>collecting</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> on alcohol <b>to</b> pay directly for alcoholism-rehabilitation centres, is called hypothecation. Finance ministers often dislike this practice, since it reduces their freedom of action. Some economic theorists regard hypothecation as intellectually dishonest since, in reality, money is fungible. Furthermore, it often happens that taxes or excises initially levied to fund some specific government programs are then later diverted to the government general fund. In some cases, such taxes are collected in fundamentally inefficient ways, for example, though highway tolls.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} welfare effects of brain-drain taxes levied by non-benevolent governments, whereby <b>a</b> country <b>collects</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> from skilled emigrants but {{potentially}} wastes a sizable {{portion of the}} revenue. Using a model in which <b>taxes</b> are chosen <b>to</b> maximize expected political rents, I show that the availability of <b>a</b> brain-drain <b>tax</b> increases <b>a</b> weighted sum of citizen utilities. However, the government's optimal brain-drain <b>tax</b> is found <b>to</b> be higher than the level that maximizes this weighted sum. In another model, <b>a</b> brain-drain <b>tax</b> is found <b>to</b> be desirable when governments use public good expenditures to compete for mobile residents.
