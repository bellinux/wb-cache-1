[...] There Hazen was again involved in litigation; he was rejected for service on a court martial considering charges against Benedict Arnold {{due to their}} previous confrontations, and he also opened complaints of supply mismanagement during the summer's roadbuilding activities. [...] A detailed review of the army {{in the spring of}} 1780 by Baron von Steuben led to the recommendation that the regiments of Hazen and Livingston be merged, as Livingston's had shrunk to 103 men. [...] Hazen and Livingston had a political tussle over seniority; although Hazen lost <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> to <b>seniority,</b> he ended up in command of the combined regiment.|$|R
40|$|This article studies <b>the</b> {{relationship}} between <b>seniority</b> and wages. Micro data {{with more than}} one observation from each firm are utilized to single out <b>the</b> <b>seniority</b> effect on wages arising within firms from <b>the</b> total <b>seniority</b> wage effect. <b>The</b> results show that <b>the</b> <b>seniority</b> effect arises within firms, but do not support the human capital explanation of <b>the</b> <b>seniority</b> wage profile. Employees with high levels of firm-specific on-the-job training requirements have less steep wage profiles. The results give some support to the theory of delayed compensation as piece rate workers have negligible returns to seniority. Copyright 1997 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|R
2500|$|Carrington {{took three}} {{batteries}} of the 1st Regiment south with Johann de Kalb in 1780, but Harrison arrived [...] "unexpectedly" [...] to <b>claim</b> <b>seniority.</b> <b>The</b> two men clashed {{and the new}} commander Horatio Gates sent Carrington to reconnoiter crossings of the Dan River. At the Battle of Camden on 16 August 1780, Harrison commanded 100 artillerists and six cannons. Otho Holland Williams recalled that Harrison's guns were massed in the center near the main north-south road. One of Harrison's officers, Captain Anthony Singleton pointed out to Williams that the British troops were about [...] away and received permission to open fire. The guns of both sides blazed away and produced a fog-like bank of smoke. When the British right wing advanced, the American militiamen on the left panicked and ran away, most without even firing a shot. The Maryland Continentals of the American right and reserve defended themselves stoutly but were enveloped and crushed with heavy losses. De Kalb was mortally wounded in the disastrous defeat.|$|R
40|$|This study {{discusses}} newly {{collected data}} concerning {{the role played by}} seniority in U. S. firms' termination and promotion decisions. The new information, based on 561 usable responses to a nation-wide survey of companies conducted by the authors, sheds light on two key questions: For what percentage of U. S. private sector employees (outside of agriculture and construction) is seniority [...] per se (that is, seniority independent of current performance) rewarded in promotion decisions? For what percentage does protection against job loss grow with seniority even when current value to the firm does not? While there appear to be important differences for hourly versus salaried employees and for those covered by collective bargaining versus those not so covered, the new evidence presented strongly supports <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> that <b>seniority</b> independent of productivity {{plays a major role in}} the compensation and termination decisions affecting all employee groups at most U.

50|$|The East and West pilots {{along with}} US Airways {{management}} signed a Transition Agreement (TA) in 2005. This tri-party agreement specifies the methods for merging the two pilot {{groups and the}} operating rules during the transition. Until a joint contract is ratified by the combined pilot group, the East and West pilots remain separate. This means that all aircraft brought to the merger by each respective pilot group can only be flown by the pre-merger pilots of each group. No cross utilization or mixing of crews and/or equipment is permitted during the transition period. (http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Collective+bargaining+agreements The Transition Agreement signed by the three parties specified that ALPA Merger Policy {{would be used to}} combine <b>the</b> <b>seniority</b> lists and US Airways management agreed to accept the list as long as certain cost requirements were met. Doug Parker officially accepted <b>the</b> <b>seniority</b> list from ALPA First Vice-President Paul Rice during December 2007.

40|$|The low-lying {{structures}} of the midshell Î½ g_ 9 / 2 Ni isotopes ^ 72 Ni and ^ 74 Ni have been investigated at the RIBF facility in RIKEN within the EURICA collaboration. Previously unobserved low-lying states were accessed {{for the first time}} following Î² decay of the mother nuclei ^ 72 Co and ^ 74 Co. As a result, we provide a complete picture in terms of <b>the</b> <b>seniority</b> scheme up to the first (8 ^+) levels for both nuclei. The experimental results are compared to shell-model calculations in order to define to what extent <b>the</b> <b>seniority</b> quantum number is preserved in the first neutron g_ 9 / 2 shell. We find that the disappearance of <b>the</b> <b>seniority</b> isomerism in <b>the</b> (8 ^+_ 1) states can be explained by a lowering of the seniority-four (6 ^+) levels as predicted years ago. For ^ 74 Ni, the internal de-excitation pattern of the newly observed (6 ^+_ 2) state supports a restoration of <b>the</b> normal <b>seniority</b> ordering up to spin J= 4.
