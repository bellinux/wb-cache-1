40|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} to prepare tint ladders of each <b>colorant</b> consisting of five or more concentrations {{in order to develop}} a <b>colorant</b> database for instrumental-based color matching, characterization of optical properties of a coloration system, and pigment mapping.

The objective of this research was to find the minimum number of samples in order to characterize each <b>colorant.</b> For the purpose of pigment identification, a pure pigment (masstone) and a mixture sample of unknown concentration with white paint were sufficient to describe each pigment qualitatively. On the other hand, pigment mapping, which resolves not only <b>colorant</b> constituents but also their concentrations, required a masstone and a mixture sample of known concentration, preferably 40 % to 60 % with white paint, to quantitatively characterize each <b>colorant.</b> For either case, only two samples were needed, which greatly simplified the process to develop a <b>colorant</b> database.

25|$|The same {{precautions}} {{that apply}} to cosmetics should be observed. If the skin shows any sign of allergy from a paint, its use should immediately be ceased. Moreover, {{it should not be}} applied to damaged, inflamed or sensitive skin. If possible, a test for allergic reaction should be performed before use. Special care should be paid to the list of ingredients, as certain dyes are not approved by the US FDA for use around the eye area—generally those associated with certain reddish <b>colorants,</b> as CI 15850 or CI 15985—or on lips, generally blue, purple or some greens containing CI 77007. More stringent regulations are in place in California regarding the amount of permissible lead on cosmetic additives, as part of Proposition 65. In the European Union, all <b>colorants</b> listed under a CI number are allowed for use on all areas.

This study conducted to determine the levels of SGOT and SGPT blood serum of mice (Mus musculus) Balb/C after administration of <b>colorant</b> powder pigment of B. orellana seed coatâ€™s at various concentrations. Design and Methods: The research is an experimental research with Factorial Design with 2 factors.

As most other oxides of rare-earth elements, holmium oxide is used as a specialty catalyst, phosphor and a laser material. Holmium laser operates at wavelength of about 2.08 micrometres, either in pulsed or continuous regime. This laser is eye safe and is used in medicine, LIDARs, wind velocity measurements and atmosphere monitoring.|$|E

25|$|Experimenting {{with the}} new technology, the forest glassmakers found it {{difficult}} to achieve the high standards of clarity and colour of the Roman methods, due mainly to the great variability of colour-controlling elements in the raw materials. European sand and soil is generally higher in iron and manganese. Iron gives a blue-green tinge to glass under usual furnace atmosphere conditions, but also may give a yellow colour. Manganese has its own purple colour which may balance out the iron colour to make colourless glass. For instance, glass made from beech wood grown on meagre lime-rich soil (e.g. Kleinlutzel, Jura) is high in manganese and thus, nearly colourless while that in a clay-rich area (e.g. Court-Chalvet, Jura) is olive green. Thus, a variety of colours may be produced and experimentation allowed the glassmakers to progress from the early muddy green-yellow-brown colours toward clear-coloured and colourless glass. Local conditions allowed some areas to produce finer glass at an earlier stage. In Bohemia {{at the end of the}} sixteenth century the decolourising powers of manganese were used to produce a clear glass suitable for engraving. The amount of carbon left in the wood ash also may affect the colour of the glass by modifying the furnace atmosphere. The glass in York Minster has been shown to be 90% naturally coloured, without added <b>colorants.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{constrained}} optimization {{method is}} employed {{to calculate the}} <b>colorant</b> values of the multispectral images. Because the spectral separation from the 31 -dimensional spectral reflectance to low dimensional <b>colorant</b> values is very complex, an inverse process based on spectral Neugebauer model and constrained optimization method is performed. Firstly, the spectral Neugebauer model is applied to predict the colorants’ spectral reflectance values, and it is modified by using the Yule-Nielsen n-value and the effective area coverages. Then, the spectral reflectance root mean square (RRMS) error is established as the objective function for the optimization method, while the <b>colorant</b> values are constrained to 0 ~ 1. At last, when the nonlinear constraints and related parameters are set appropriately, the <b>colorant</b> values are accurately calculated for the multispectral images corresponding to the minimum RRMS errors.
