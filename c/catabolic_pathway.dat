5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are also}} {{important}} in metabolic control. Many metabolic pathways in the cell are inhibited by metabolites that control enzyme activity through allosteric regulation or substrate inhibition. A good example is the allosteric regulation of the glycolytic pathway. This <b>catabolic</b> <b>pathway</b> consumes glucose and produces ATP, NADH and pyruvate. A key step for the regulation of glycolysis is an early reaction in the pathway catalysed by phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1). When ATP levels rise, ATP binds an allosteric site in PFK1 to decrease {{the rate of the}} enzyme reaction; glycolysis is inhibited and ATP production falls. This negative feedback control helps maintain a steady concentration of ATP in the cell. However, metabolic pathways are not just regulated through inhibition since enzyme activation is equally important. With respect to PFK1, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and ADP are examples of metabolites that are allosteric activators.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{metabolic}} pathways that are characterized by their ability to either synthesize molecules with the utilization of energy (anabolic pathway) or break down of complex molecules by releasing energy in the process (<b>catabolic</b> <b>pathway).</b> The two pathways complement each other in that the energy released from one is used up by the other. The degradative process of a <b>catabolic</b> <b>pathway</b> provides the energy required to conduct a biosynthesis of an anabolic pathway. In addition to the two distinct metabolic pathways is the amphibolic pathway, which can be either catabolic or anabolic based on the need for or the availability of energy.|$|E
25|$|A <b>catabolic</b> <b>pathway</b> is {{a series}} of {{reactions}} that bring about a net release of energy {{in the form of a}} high energy phosphate bond formed with the energy carriers Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP) to produce Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP), respectively. The net reaction is, therefore, thermodynamically favorable, for it results in a lower free energy for the final products. A <b>catabolic</b> <b>pathway</b> is an exergonic system that produces chemical energy in the form of ATP, GTP, NADH, NADPH, FADH2, etc. from energy containing sources such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The end products are often carbon dioxide, water, and ammonia. Coupled with an endergonic reaction of anabolism, the cell can synthesize new macromolecules using the original precursors of the anabolic pathway. An example of a coupled reaction is the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to form the intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate by the enzyme phsophofructokinase accompanied by the hydrolysis of ATP in the pathway of glycolysis. The resulting chemical reaction within the metabolic pathway is highly thermodynamically favorable and, as a result, irreversible in the cell.|$|E

40|$|Significant {{selective}} enrichments of mutants defective in <b>catabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> can {{be achieved}} by exposure of pseudomonad cells to halogenated analogs of growth substrates. Between 3 and 95 % of viable clones rescued from such enrichments have been defective in specific <b>catabolic</b> <b>pathways.</b> This has been demonstrated for eight different <b>catabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> for aromatic compounds in pseudomonads, in which the genes are located on plasmids or on the chromosome. The plasmid-encoded pathways studied include those for the catabolism of p-cymene (CYM), m- and p-xylenes (TOL), naphthalene (NAH), salicylate (SAL), and 4 -methylphthalate (MOP), and the chromosome-encoded pathways include those for p-hydroxybenzoate, monohydric phenols, and p-anisate utilization. The recalcitrance of halogenated compounds may, in part, be explained by these observations, which introduce an as yet not widely recognized factor in assessment of biodegradability of halogenated compounds and their effects on the transformation of the natural substrates...|$|R
25|$|In {{contrast}} to catabolic pathways, anabolic pathways require an energy input to construct macromolecules such as polypeptides, nucleic acids, proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids. The isolated reaction of anabolism is unfavorable {{in a cell}} due to a positive Gibbs Free Energy (+ΔG). Thus, an input of chemical energy through a coupling with an exergonic reaction is necessary. The coupled reaction of the <b>catabolic</b> <b>pathway</b> affects the thermodynamics of the reaction by lowering the overall activation energy of an anabolic pathway and allowing the reaction to take place. Otherwise, an endergonic reaction is non-spontaneous.|$|E

2500|$|Bilirubin (formerly {{referred}} to as haematoidin and discovered by Rudolf Virchow in 1847) is a yellow compound that occurs in the normal <b>catabolic</b> <b>pathway</b> that breaks down heme in vertebrates. This catabolism is a necessary process in the body's clearance of waste products that arise from the destruction of aged red blood cells. First the hemoglobin gets stripped of the heme molecule which thereafter passes through various processes of porphyrin catabolism, depending {{on the part of}} the body in which the breakdown occurs. For example, the molecules excreted in the urine differ from those in the faeces. The production of biliverdin from heme is the first major step in the <b>catabolic</b> <b>pathway,</b> after which the enzyme biliverdin reductase performs the second step, producing bilirubin from biliverdin.|$|E

40|$|D-Arginine {{dehydrogenase}} {{activity was}} discovered in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This enzyme was inducible by its substrate, D-arginine, {{as well as by}} its product, 2 -ketoarginine, but not by L-arginine. The enzyme activity was measured in uitro, in the presence of artificial electron acceptors (phenazine methosulphate and iodonitrotetrazolium chloride). 2 -Ketoarginine was catabolized further to 4 -guanidinobutyraldehyde, 4 -guanidinobutyrate and 4 -aminobutyrate. Two enzymes involved, 4 -guanidinobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase and guanidinobutyrase, were inducible by 2 -ketoarginine; the latter enzyme was also strongly induced by 4 -guanidinobutyrate. An arginine racemase activity was detected by an in vivo test. D-Arginine had the potential to be catabolized via the D-arginine dehydrogenase pathway and, after racemization, via the three L-arginine <b>catabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> previously demonstrated in P. aeruginosa. In mutants blocked in the L-arginine succinyltransferase pathway, but not in the wild-type, L-arginine was channelled partially into the D-arginine dehydrogenase pathway. Mutations in the kauB locus abolished growth of P. aeruginosa on 2 -ketoarginine, agmatine and putrescine, and led to loss of 4 -guanidino bu t yralde h yde de h ydrogenase and 4 -amino bu tyralde hyde de hydrogenase activities. Thus, these two activities appear to be due to one enzyme in P. aeruginosa. The kauB locus was mapped on the chromosome between 1 ysA and argB and was not linked to known genes involved in the three L-arginine <b>catabolic</b> <b>pathways.</b> The existence of four arginine <b>catabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> illustrates the metabolic versatility of P. aeruginosa...|$|R
40|$|The Crc {{protein is}} {{involved}} in the repression of several <b>catabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> for the assimilation of some sugars, nitrogenated compounds, and hydrocarbons in Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa when other preferred carbon sources are present in the culture medium (catabolic repression). Crc appears to be a component of a signal transduction pathway modulating carbon metabolism in pseudomonads, although its mode of action is unknown. To better understand the role of Crc, the proteome profile of two otherwise isogenic P. putida strains containing either a wild-type or an inactivated crc allele was compared. The results showed that Crc {{is involved in}} the catabolic repression of the hpd and hmgA genes from the homogentisate pathway, one of the central <b>catabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> for aromatic compounds that is used to assimilate intermediates derived from the oxidation of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and several aromatic hydrocarbons. This led us to analyze whether Crc also regulates the expression of the other central <b>catabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> for aromatic compounds present in P. putida. It was found that genes required to assimilate benzoate through the catechol pathway (benA and catBCA) and 4 -OH-benzoate through the protocatechuate pathway (pobA and pcaHG) are also negatively modulated by Crc. However, the pathway for phenylacetate appeared to be unaffected by Crc. These results expand the influence of Crc to pathways used to assimilate several aromatic compounds, which highlights its importance as a master regulator of carbon metabolism in P. putida...|$|R

Both its creation and release are tightly regulated, as is its removal. Multiple neurochemical pathways are responsible for the catabolism of 5 -HT and are phyla specific; therefore, by elucidating these <b>catabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> we glean greater understanding of the relationships and origins of various transmitter systems. Here, 5 -HT <b>catabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> were studied in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Xenoturbella bocki, two organisms occupying distinct positions in deuterostomes. The 5 -HT-related compounds detected in these organisms were compared with those reported in other phyla. In S. purpuratus, 5 -HT-related metabolites include N-acetyl serotonin, γ-glutamyl-serotonin and 5 -hydroxyindole acetic acid; the quantity and type were found to vary based on the specific tissues analyzed. In addition to these compounds, varying levels of tryptamine were also seen. Upon addition of a 5 -HT precursor and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, 5 -HT itself was detected. In similar experiments using X. bocki tissues, the 5 -HT-related compounds found included 5 -HT sulfate, γ-glutamyl-serotonin and 5 -hydroxyindole acetic acid, as well as 5 -HT and tryptamine. The sea urchin metabolizes 5 -HT {{in a manner similar to}} both gastropod mollusks, as evidenced by the detection of γ-glutamyl-serotonin, and vertebrates, as indicated by the presence of 5 -hydroxyindole acetic acid and N-acetyl serotonin.

(i) Endogenously biosynthesized triacylglycerols and cholesteryl esters were degraded extra-lysosomaily {{since they were}} catabolized at similar rates in normal and in WD fibroblasts. In NLSD fibroblasts, the degradation of endogenous triacylglycerols was severely deficient, whereas that of endogenous cholesteryl esters was in the normal range, (ii) Reconstituted high density lipoproteins (HDL) containing radiolabelled [3 H]triolein and cholesteryl [14 C]oleate were taken up by cultured fibroblasts and rapidly degraded in a non-lysosomal compartment. In NLSD fibroblasts the degradation of HDL-[3 H]triolein was blocked whereas that of HDL-[14 C]cholesteryl oleate was in the normal range. These data suggest that: (i) the cytoplasmic pools of triacylglycerols and cholesteryl esters originate from HDL uptake and from endogenous biosynthesis as well; (ii) cytoplasmic (non-lysosomal) triacylglycerols and cholesteryl esters are degraded by two separate <b>catabolic</b> <b>pathways...</b>|$|R
