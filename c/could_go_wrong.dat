25|$|Cardiacs toured and gigged {{intermittently}} during 1990, {{culminating in}} a shared concert with Napalm Death at Salisbury Arts Centre on 30 August. The Cardiacs half of the concert was filmed and released as the video Maresnest (produced by Steve Mallet and directed by Steve Payne, and eventually also released as the 1995 live album All that Glitters is a Mares Nest). The band performed as a seven-piece, with Sarah Smith making a one-day return as a band member. Although the concert has achieved legendary status amongst Cardiacs fans, {{it was also an}} occasion on which everything that <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>wrong,</b> did go wrong. Among other things, Tim Smith's guitar fell apart and keys fell off Sarah Smith's saxophone.|$|E
25|$|A {{well trained}} soldier could fire {{up to three}} rounds per minute, {{and the use of}} the platoon {{formation}} by the British army meant that a constant volley of fire could be employed. There was much that <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> with the musket– from misfires in wet weather, to the gun firing at random due to sparks which set the powder off. In the heat of battle a soldier may forget to remove the ramrod from the barrel before firing. Nonetheless, the musket proved to be an overall reliable weapon which's performance, especially when used en masse, should not be underestimated. Even though contemporary writers often state that a musket's effective range when firing at an individual target did not go beyond 30 paces, modern test firings at individual human-sized targets suggest that a musket's effective range lies somewhere between 70 and 100 yards.|$|E
500|$|An inquiry was {{chaired by}} High Court judge Sir Michael Connell, the deputy senior steward of the Jockey Club since 1988. His report apportioned some blame to Keith Brown for {{allowing}} the horses {{to get too}} close to the tape, but most blame to Ken Evans, the official further down the track, for failing to notice the second false start.

500|$|Although Keynesian Nobel laureate Paul Krugman praised Friedman as a [...] "great {{economist}} {{and a great}} man" [...] after Friedman's death in 2006, and acknowledged his many, widely accepted contributions to empirical economics, Krugman had been, and remains, a prominent critic of Friedman. Krugman has written that [...] "he slipped all too easily into claiming both that markets always work and that only markets work. It's extremely hard to find cases in which Friedman acknowledged the possibility that markets <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>wrong,</b> or that government intervention could serve a useful purpose." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall {{was very}} {{positive}} towards the episode on his blog What's Alan Watching, calling Czuchry's casting [...] "genius" [...] and that [...] "the heavier {{focus on the}} rape storyline was welcome, though {{the amount of time}} spent on Logan Squared robbed it of some urgency." [...] In addition, he wrote that [...] "The 'Just Shoot Me' reunion gave an interesting twist to the usual private eye infidelity case." [...] Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, gave a mostly positive review, writing that it struck a good balance in a storyline that <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> very quickly. [...] "This happens with emotionally charged criminal cases. Mass public scapegoating is an all-too-human reaction, one studied by a bunch of social sciences (Salem Witch Trials, anyone?). And it’s certainly interesting to have Veronica trying to be the voice of reason. I think that largely works here, but it’s a delicate balance. This could easily go so very wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|On 13 April 1943 the {{committee}} of the Chiefs of Staff met and agreed that they thought the plan should proceed. The committee informed Colonel John Bevan – the head of London Controlling Section, which controlled the planning and co-ordination of deception operations – {{that he needed to}} obtain final approval from Churchill. Two days later Bevan met the prime minister – who was in bed, wearing a dressing gown and smoking a cigar – in his rooms at the Cabinet War offices and explained the plan. He warned Churchill that there were several aspects that <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>wrong,</b> including that the Spaniards might pass the corpse back to the British, with the papers unread. Churchill replied that [...] "in that case we shall have to get the body back and give it another swim". Churchill gave his approval to the operation, but delegated the final confirmation to Eisenhower, the overall military commander in the Mediterranean, whose plan to invade Sicily would be affected. Bevan sent an encrypted telegram to Eisenhower's headquarters in Algeria requesting final confirmation, which was received on 17 April.|$|E

500|$|Glee {{choreographer}} Zach Woodlee described [...] "Proud Mary" [...] as the [...] "scariest" [...] number produced to date, citing {{concerns with}} choreographing an entire routine in wheelchairs and problems building the correct staging. Woodlee explained the stage ramps were initially built too steeply, preventing the actors from ascending them in wheelchairs, {{and that the}} actors experienced problems learning to distribute their weight correctly, flipping the wheelchairs over backwards: [...] "It was like roller derby. All of the actors would fall backwards and hit their heads—particularly Lea Michele. You lose your balance really quick {{when you try to}} go up a ramp in a wheelchair. Amber Riley caught an edge going down a ramp and fell off completely. There were pile-ups; there were crashes. Basically, everything that <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>wrong,</b> did." [...] Murphy specified to Woodlee that cast members should not be able to leave their wheelchairs during the number, as: [...] "Artie doesn't get to get up ever, so I didn't want anyone to get up." [...] Woodlee agreed: [...] "If it looked too fun and easy, it wouldn't read right. Ryan really wanted people to understand what Artie deals with." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{cognitive}} {{models of}} social anxiety disorder, those with social phobias experience dread over {{how they will}} be presented to others. They may feel overly self-conscious, pay high self-attention after the activity, or have high performance standards for themselves. According to the social psychology theory of self-presentation, a sufferer attempts to create a well-mannered impression towards others but believes he or she is unable to do so. Many times, prior to the potentially anxiety-provoking social situation, sufferers may deliberately review what <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> and how to deal with each unexpected case. [...] After the event, they may have the perception that they performed unsatisfactorily. Consequently, they will perceive anything that may have possibly been abnormal as embarrassing. These thoughts may extend for weeks or longer. Cognitive distortions are a hallmark, and are learned about in CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy). Thoughts are often self-defeating and inaccurate. Those with social phobia tend to interpret neutral or ambiguous conversations with a negative outlook, and many studies suggest that socially anxious individuals remember more negative memories than those less distressed.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{they had}} 23 baserunners in the game, 13 of whom they left on base, the Nationals’ season ended with {{elimination}} in the NLDS, as in their previous three postseason appearances, {{and it was}} the third time that they had played Game 5 of an NLDS at home and lost, the only MLB team other than the Oakland Athletics to lose more than one NLDS Game 5 loss at home over the previous decade. The Nationals became only the second team in MLB history to draw at least nine walks and score at least eight runs in a postseason game and still lose, the only previous team to do it having been the 1997 Cleveland Indians in the 1997 World Series. It was the eighth time the Nationals had played a one-run game in their postseason history, and they had lost all eight. It was the tenth time in a row that a team managed by Dusty Baker had lost a postseason game in which it had a chance to advance to the next round of the playoffs. Summing up the Nationals′ evening in a postgame interview, Jayson Werth said, [...] "It feels like everything that <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>wrong,</b> did...I can't believe we lost that game." ...|$|E

2500|$|His next posting, {{starting}} 25 September 1879, was to [...] as Flag Captain to Sir Leopold McClintock, {{commanding the}} North American squadron. Northampton {{was a new}} ship {{with a number of}} innovations, including twin screws, searchlights and telephones, as well as being armed with torpedoes. It was fitted with an experimental Thompson-designed compass, which the inventor was on hand to adjust. Three days were spent attempting and failing to adjust the compass, with Thomson becoming increasingly bad tempered, until it was noticed that by accident the degree card had only been marked with 359 degrees instead of 360. The ship was fitted with a new design of lamp created by Captain Philip Colomb, who came on board to inspect them. As a joke, Fisher arranged for anything that <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> with the lamps to do so, sending Colomb away disheartened over his invention (although Fisher officially reported favourably about the lamps). On another occasion, the naval hospital at Halifax requested some flags to fly for the Queen's birthday. Fisher obliged, but sent only yellow and black flags signifying plague and quarantine. On the other hand, he worked hard at improving his ship. As reported by his second in command, Commander Wilmot Fawkes, the ship carried out 150 runs with torpedoes in a fortnight, whereas the whole rest of the navy only performed 200 in a year.|$|E

6000|$|He {{seemed to}} see himself proposing to her--ages ago. They were strolling {{up the slope}} of a lawn. Groups of people were {{scattered}} in sunshine. The shadows of leafy boughs lay still on the short grass. The coloured sunshades far off, passing between trees, resembled deliberate and brilliant butterflies moving without a flutter. Men smiling amiably, or else very grave, within the impeccable shelter of their black coats, stood {{by the side of}} women who, clustered in clear summer toilettes, recalled all the fabulous tales of enchanted gardens where animated flowers smile at bewitched knights. There was a sumptuous serenity in it all, a thin, vibrating excitement, the perfect security, as of an invincible ignorance, that evoked within him a transcendent belief in felicity as the lot of all mankind, a recklessly picturesque desire to get promptly something for himself only, out of that splendour unmarred by any shadow of a thought. The girl walked by his side across an open space; no one was near, and suddenly he stood still, as if inspired, and spoke. He remembered looking at her pure eyes, at her candid brow; he remembered glancing about quickly to see if they were being observed, and thinking that nothing <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> in a world of so much charm, purity, and distinction. He was proud of it. He was one of its makers, of its possessors, of its guardians, of its extollers. He wanted to grasp it solidly, to get as much gratification as he could out of it; and in view of its incomparable quality, of its unstained atmosphere, of its nearness to the heaven of its choice, this gust of brutal desire seemed the most noble of aspirations. In a second he lived again through all these moments, and then all the pathos of his failure presented itself to him with such vividness that there was a suspicion of tears in his tone when he said almost unthinkingly, [...] "My God! I did love you!" ...|$|E
