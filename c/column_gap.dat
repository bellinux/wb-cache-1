It is also known that probabilistic alignments based on marginal probabilities (e. g. aligned-column and/or gap probabilities) provide more accurate alignment than conventional maximum score-based alignment. There exists, however, no study about probabilistic alignment that considers quality scores explicitly, although the method {{is expected to be}} useful in SNP/indel callers and bisulfite mapping, because accurate estimation of aligned <b>columns</b> or <b>gaps</b> is important in those analyses. Results: In this study, we propose methods of probabilistic alignment that consider quality scores of (one of) the sequences as well as a usual score matrix. The method is based on posterior decoding techniques in which various marginal probabilities are computed from a probabilistic model of alignments with quality scores, and can arbitrarily trade-off sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of prediction (aligned <b>columns</b> and <b>gaps).</b> The method is directly applicable to read mapping (alignment) toward accurate detection of SNPs and indels. Several computational experiments indicated that probabilistic alignments can estimate aligned <b>columns</b> and <b>gaps</b> accurately, compared with other mapping algorithms e. g. SHRiMP 2, Stampy, BWA and Novoalign. The study also suggested that our approach yields favorable precision for SNP/indel calling.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{presence}} of gaps in an alignment of nucleotide or protein sequences {{is often an}} inconvenience for bioinformatical studies. In phylogenetic and other analyses, for instance, <b>gapped</b> <b>columns</b> are often discarded entirely from the alignment. Results MaxAlign is a program that optimizes the alignment prior to such analyses. Specifically, it maximizes the number of nucleotide (or amino acid) symbols that are present in gap-free columns – the alignment area – by selecting the optimal subset of sequences to exclude from the alignment. MaxAlign can be used prior to phylogenetic and bioinformatical analyses {{as well as in}} other situations where this form of alignment improvement is useful. In this work we test MaxAlign's performance in these tasks and compare the accuracy of phylogenetic estimates including and excluding <b>gapped</b> <b>columns</b> from the analysis, with and without processing with MaxAlign. In this paper we also introduce a new simple measure of tree similarity, Normalized Symmetric Similarity (NSS) that we consider useful for comparing tree topologies. Conclusion We demonstrate how MaxAlign is helpful in detecting misaligned or defective sequences without requiring manual inspection. We also show that it is not advisable to exclude <b>gapped</b> <b>columns</b> from phylogenetic analyses unless MaxAlign is used first. Finally, we find that the sequences removed by MaxAlign from an alignment tend to be those that would otherwise be associated with low phylogenetic accuracy, and that the {{presence of}} gaps in any given sequence does not seem to disturb the phylogenetic estimates of other sequences.

In designing such navigation safety applications, reliable dissemination of data, i. e., every affected vehicle receives data, is the key issue.

40|$|Thermal barrier {{coatings}} with a columnar microstructure {{are prone to}} erosion damage by a mechanism of surface cracking upon impact by small foreign particles. In order to explore this erosion mechanism, the elastic indentation and the elastic-plastic indentation responses of a columnar thermal barrier coating to a spherical indenter were determined by the finite element method and by analytical models. It was shown that the indentation response is intermediate between that of a homogeneous half-space and that given by an elastic-plastic mattress model (with the columns behaving as independent non-linear springs). The sensitivity of the indentation behaviour to geometry and to the material parameters was explored: {{the diameter of the}} <b>columns,</b> the <b>gap</b> width between <b>columns,</b> the coefficient of Coulomb friction between columns and the layer height of the thermal barrier coating. The calculations revealed that the level of induced tensile stress is sufficient to lead to cracking of the columns at a depth of about the column radius. It was also demonstrated that the underlying soft bond coat can undergo plastic indentation when the coating comprises parallel columns, but this is less likely for the more realistic case of a random arrangement of tapered columns.

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{analysis}} of trace gases from fluid inclusions of minerals has been developed. The purge and trap GC-MS system is based on the system described by Nolting et al.

The sample preconcentration cold trap consists of a U-shaped glass lined steel tube (GLT™), that is immersed into a small liquid nitrogen Dewar vessel for cooling. A rapid desorption step heats up the preconcentration tube in < 30 s from - 196 °C to 200 °C. The process is carried out by using a pressurized air stream to dissipate the liquid nitrogen followed by resistive heating of the trap. The design of the cold trap and the direct transfer of desorbed analytes onto the GC column via a deactivated capillary <b>column</b> retention <b>gap</b> made sample refocusing within the GC oven unnecessary. Furthermore, a special air-tight grinding device was developed in which samples ranging from soft halite (hardness 2, Mohs scale) to hard quartz (hardness 7) are effectively ground to average diameters of 1000 nm or below, thereby releasing gases from fluid inclusions of minerals.

30|$|The {{relationship}} between the indoor–outdoor air temperature and electric consumption also can be expressed by a bi-linear relationship. Hockey-stick regression analysis [19] was {{used to analyze the}} effect of the indoor–outdoor air temperature difference on the increasing tendency of electric consumption. In this method, a predictor variable is used as the threshold to perform a convergent calculation to minimize the residual sum of the square of the two linear regressions line. As shown in Fig.  8, when the indoor–outdoor air temperature difference exceeded the threshold, the slope of regression line increased rapidly. The thresholds of each experimental house were 20.8  °C for Type WM, 20.7  °C for Type M, and 24.0  °C for Type I. Comparing the threshold for Type I with those of other experimental houses, it was 3  °C higher. That is, Type I tended to suppress the electric consumption associated with increases in the indoor–outdoor air temperature differences more effectively than the other houses. This result {{can be attributed to the}} effect of thermal capacity [16], air tightness, and the status of air conditioning equipment in the building. As the indoor–outdoor air temperature or vapor pressure difference increased, the indoor–outdoor air pressure difference also increased. In the winter, as cold air from the outside flowed inside, the thermal load became higher. Murakami [20] reported that walls with exposed timber columns tend to be less airtight than the stud wall-framed structure. Since Type I was a stud wall-framed structure finished on both sides, its structural plywood and wallpapering increased air tightness. On the contrary, the walls in Type WM and Type M were constructed with exposed timber <b>columns,</b> and <b>gaps</b> frequently occurred between the columns and mud walls. In addition, when the indoor–outdoor air temperature exceeded 25  °C, the electric consumption increased significantly as well as other houses. The operating characteristics of the heat pump under cold conditions likely affected these results. When the outdoor air temperature is below the freezing point, frost is generated in the heat exchanger of the heat pump. To remove this frost, warm air was blown on to the heat exchanger. It is considered that this defrost operation increased electric consumption in each experimental house when the indoor–outdoor air temperature difference was significant.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{quality of}} {{progressive}} sequence alignments strongly {{depends on the}} accuracy of the individual pairwise alignment steps since gaps that are introduced at one step cannot be removed at later aggregation steps. Adjacent insertions and deletions necessarily appear in arbitrary order in pairwise alignments and hence form an unavoidable source of errors. Research: Here we present a modified variant of progressive sequence alignments that addresses both issues. Instead of pairwise alignments we use exact dynamic programming to align sequence or profile triples. This avoids a large fractions of the ambiguities arising in pairwise alignments. In the subsequent aggregation steps we follow the logic of the Neighbor- Net algorithm, which constructs a phylogenetic network by step- wisely replacing triples by pairs instead of combining pairs to singletons. To this end the three- way alignments are subdivided into two partial alignments, at which stage all- <b>gap</b> <b>columns</b> are naturally removed. This alleviates the '' once a gap, always a gap '' problem of progressive alignment procedures. Conclusion: The three- way Neighbor- Net based alignment program aln 3 nn is shown to compare favorably on both protein sequences and nucleic acids sequences to other progressive alignment tools. In the latter case one easily can include scoring terms that consider secondary structure features. Overall, the quality of resulting alignments in general exceeds that of clustalw or other multiple alignments tools even though our software does not included heuristics for context dependent (mis) match scores...|$|R
40|$|Volatile organic halocarbons (VOX) play an {{important}} role in atmospheric processes. However, biogeochemical release mechanisms from terrestrial environments are complex, not well understood in most parts and a clear view of their relative importance is lacking. Previously, the lithospheric VOX formation potential was subject of only few studies. In the first part of this thesis the development of a new method for the analysis of VOX from rocks and minerals is reported in order to investigate terrigenic VOX formation potential. The purge and trap GC-MS system was optimized for the analyses of halogenated volatile organic compounds having boiling points as low as - 128 °C for carbon tetrafluoride (CF 4). The design of the U-shaped glass lined steel tube (GLT™) cold trap for sample preconcentration and the rapid desorption via resistant heating transferred the desorbed analytes directly onto the GC column via a deactivated capillary <b>column</b> retention <b>gap</b> made sample re-focussing unnecessary. Furthermore, a special air-tight grinding device was developed in which samples ranging from soft halite (hardness 2, Moh’s scale) to hard quartz (hardness 7) are effectively ground to average diameters of 1000 nm or below, thereby releasing gases from fluid inclusions of minerals. The gases are then purged from the grinding chamber with a He carrier gas flow. In the second part of this work, the newly developed method is applied to a set of various mineral and rock samples including fluorite, quartz and halite. The analytical results from GC-MS prove the presence of a wide spectrum of volatile compounds from FIs trapped in various minerals. SF 6 and CF 4 were released from fluorites. Methyl bromide, dichloroethene and dichloroethane were detected in quartz samples from the Archean Yilgarn craton in Australia. Methyl chloride (MeCl) has been detected from almost all samples, including halites, fluorites, quartz and dolerites. Initial heating experiments with halites using purge-and-trap GC-MS as well as pyrolysis-GC-MS demonstrated the important role of temperature in MeCl and VOX formation. Finally, in the last part of this dissertation a case study on one possible formation pathway for the volatile compounds MeCl and dimethylsulfide (DMS), via thermolytic degradation of the amino acid derivative methyl methionine is investigated. A fast response of MeCl and dimethylsulfide emission upon heating of freeze-dried samples at 40 °C was observed and made this a plausible abiotic volatile formation mechanism. Besides the mechanistic studies with methyl methionine and structurally related substances, the emission of MeCl and DMS from fluid inclusions, soil samples of terrestrial salt lakes and air sampled immediately above the salt lake surfaces indicated the relevance of this formation pathway for hypersaline environments...|$|R

Satellite-observed clouds {{have been used to}} correct model-predicted photolysis rates, and satellite-constrained top-down NOx emissions have been used to identify and reduce uncertainties in bottom-up NOx emissions. However, studies on using multiple satellite-derived model inputs to improve O 3 State Implementation Plan (SIP) modeling are rare. In this thesis, observations of clouds from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and of NO 2 from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) are used to adjust the inputs to SIP modeling of O 3 in Texas. The discrete Kalman filter (DKF) inversion approach is successfully applied with decoupled direct method (DDM) sensitivities in the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with extensions (CAMx) model to adjust Texas NOx emissions in designated emission regions and categories to better match OMI NO 2 data. The NO 2 vertical <b>column</b> densities (VCD) <b>gap</b> between OMI and CAMx over rural areas is alleviated by adding missing lightning and aviation and underestimated soil NOx emissions to the base regulatory emission inventory and further reduced by increasing modeled NOx lifetime and adding an artificial NO 2 layer in the upper troposphere. The region-based DKF inversion using OMI NO 2 tends to scale up NOx emissions in most regions, which conflicts with the inversion results using ground NO 2 measurements and fails to improve the ground-level O 3 simulations. The sector-based DKF inversion using OMI NO 2 suggests scaling down area and non-road NOx emissions by 50 %, leading to approximately 2 - 5 ppb decrease in ground 8 -h O 3 concentrations, and improving both hourly ground-level NO 2 and O 3 simulations by reducing biases by 0. 25 and 0. 04 and errors by 0. 13 and 0. 04, respectively. Finally, using both GOES-derived photolysis rates and OMI-constrained NOx emissions reduces modeled bias and error by 0. 05, and increases the model correlations in simulating ground O 3 measurements and makes O 3 more sensitive to NOx emissions in the O 3 nonattainment areas...|$|R

Gas-liquid flow may be characterised {{in terms of the}} gas void fraction, α. This is an important variable in two-phase flow, used in predicting the occurrence of flow regimes, and the associated pressure drop, and mass and heat transfer. The gas void fraction transitions in a two-phase flow system from uniform bubble flow (homogeneous) to churn-turbulent bubble flow (heterogeneous) in an open tube bubble column (OTBC) and an annular <b>gap</b> bubble <b>column</b> (AGBC) have been investigated using a vertical column with an internal diameter of 0. 102 m, containing a range of concentric inner tubes which formed an annular gap; the inner tubes had diameter ratios from 0. 25 - 0. 69. Gas (air) superficial velocities in the range 0. 014 - 0. 200 m/s were studied. Tap water and aqueous solutions of ethanol and isopropanol, with concentrations in the range 8 - 300 ppm by mass, were used as the working liquids. Experimental results are presented to show that there are very significant differences in the mean gas void fractions measured in the OTBC and the AGBC, when operated at the same gas superficial velocity using a porous sparger. The mean gas void fraction decreases with increasing ratio of the inner to outer diameter of the annular <b>gap</b> <b>column</b> and the transition to heterogeneous flow occurs at lower gas superficial velocities and lower void fractions. Two reasons are proposed and validated by experimental investigations: (i) the presence of the inner tube causes large bubbles to form near the sparger, which destabilize the homogeneous bubbly flow and reduce the mean void fraction; this was confirmed by deliberately injecting large bubbles into a homogeneous dispersion of smaller bubbles. Moreover, (ii) the shape of the void fraction profiles changes with gap geometry, which affects the distribution parameter in the drift flux model. Radial profiles of the local void fraction were obtained using a two- and four-point conductivity probe, and were cross-sectionally averaged to give mean values that were within 12...|$|R
