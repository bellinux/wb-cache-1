5|$|Then if V'i = V {{for each}} i, the {{resulting}} direct sum {{can be written}} in exponential notation as V⊕N, or simply VN {{with the understanding that}} the direct sum is the default. We can again replace the set N with a <b>cardinal</b> <b>number</b> n to get V'n, although without choosing a specific standard set with cardinality n, this is defined only up to isomorphism. Taking V to be the field R of real numbers (thought of as a vector space over itself) and n to be some natural number, we get the vector space that is most commonly studied in linear algebra, the real vector space Rn.|$|E

In Old Church Slavonic, the <b>cardinal</b> <b>numbers</b> 5 to 10 were feminine nouns; when quantifying a noun, that noun was declined in the genitive plural like other nouns that followed a noun of quantity (one would say the equivalent of [...] "five of people").|$|R

25|$|A large {{cardinal}} is a <b>cardinal</b> <b>number</b> with {{an extra}} property. Many such properties are studied, including inaccessible cardinals, measurable cardinals, and many more. These properties typically imply the <b>cardinal</b> <b>number</b> must be very large, with {{the existence of a}} cardinal with the specified property unprovable in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{logarithm}} of {{an infinite}} <b>cardinal</b> <b>number</b> κ {{is defined as}} the least <b>cardinal</b> <b>number</b> μ such that κ ≤ 2μ. Logarithms of infinite cardinals are useful in some fields of mathematics, for example in the study of cardinal invariants of topological spaces, though they lack some of the properties that logarithms of positive real numbers possess.|$|E
25|$|Proof: Assume the contrary, and let C be {{the largest}} <b>cardinal</b> <b>number.</b> Then (in the von Neumann {{formulation}} of cardinality) C is a set and therefore has a power set 2C which, by Cantor's theorem, has cardinality strictly larger than C. Demonstrating a cardinality (namely that of 2C) larger than C, which {{was assumed to be}} the greatest <b>cardinal</b> <b>number,</b> falsifies the definition of C. This contradiction establishes that such a cardinal cannot exist.|$|E

25|$|Clearly then, the {{existence}} of an assignment of an ordinal to every well-ordered set requires replacement as well. Similarly the von Neumann cardinal assignment which assigns a <b>cardinal</b> <b>number</b> to each set requires replacement, as well as axiom of choice.|$|E

25|$|For {{dealing with}} {{infinite}} sets, the natural {{numbers have been}} generalized to the ordinal numbers and to the cardinal numbers. The former gives the ordering of the set, while the latter gives its size. For finite sets, both ordinal and cardinal numbers are identified with the natural numbers. In the infinite case, many ordinal numbers correspond to the same <b>cardinal</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, <b>cardinal</b> <b>numbers,</b> or <b>cardinals</b> for short, are a {{generalization}} {{of the natural}} numbers {{used to measure the}} cardinality (size) of sets. The cardinality of a finite set is a natural number: the number of elements in the set. The transfinite <b>cardinal</b> <b>numbers</b> describe the sizes of infinite sets.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reason for}} using {{logistic}} regression for {{this problem is}} that the dependent variable pass/fail represented by [...] "1" [...] and [...] "0" [...] are not <b>cardinal</b> <b>numbers.</b> If the problem was changed so that pass/fail was replaced with the grade 0-100 (<b>cardinal</b> <b>numbers),</b> then simple regression analysis could be used.|$|R

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century Cantor {{was aware}} of the non-existence of the set of all {{cardinal}} numbers and the set of all ordinal numbers. In letters to David Hilbert and Richard Dedekind he wrote about inconsistent sets, the elements of which cannot be thought of as being all together, and he used this result to prove that every consistent set has a <b>cardinal</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cardinal numbers can {{be defined}} as follows. Define two sets to have the same size by: there exists a {{bijection}} between the two sets (a one-to-one correspondence between the elements). Then a <b>cardinal</b> <b>number</b> is, by definition, a class consisting of all sets of the same size. To have the same size is an equivalence relation, and the cardinal numbers are the equivalence classes.|$|E
25|$|A {{cardinal}} invariant is {{a property}} of the real line measured by a <b>cardinal</b> <b>number.</b> For example, a well-studied invariant is the smallest cardinality {{of a collection of}} meagre sets of reals whose union is the entire real line. These are invariants in the sense that any two isomorphic models of set theory must give the same cardinal for each invariant. Many cardinal invariants have been studied, and the relationships between them are often complex and related to axioms of set theory.|$|E

25|$|If V is a {{standard}} model of ZFC and κ is an inaccessible in V, then: Vκ {{is one of the}} intended models of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory; and Def(Vκ) is one of the intended models of Mendelson's version of Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory which excludes global choice, replacing limitation of size by replacement and ordinary choice; and Vκ+1 is one of the intended models of Morse–Kelley set theory. Here Def (X) is the Δ0 definable subsets of X (see constructible universe). However, κ {{does not need to be}} inaccessible, or even a <b>cardinal</b> <b>number,</b> in order for Vκ to be {{a standard}} model of ZF (see below).|$|E
25|$|Cardinal and ordinal numbers {{must agree}} in gender (masculine or feminine; mixed groups {{are treated as}} masculine) with the noun they are describing. If {{there is no such}} noun (e.g. a {{telephone}} number or a house number in a street address), the feminine form is used. Ordinal numbers must also agree in number and definite status like other adjectives. The <b>cardinal</b> <b>number</b> precedes the noun (e.g., shlosha yeladim), except for the number one which succeeds it (e.g., yeled echad). The number two is special: shnayim (m.) and shtayim (f.) become shney (m.) and shtey (f.) when followed by the noun they count. For ordinal numbers (numbers indicating position) greater than ten the cardinal is used.|$|E
25|$|Besides the cardinality, which {{describes}} {{the size of}} a set, ordered sets also form a subject of set theory. The axiom of choice guarantees that every set can be well-ordered, which means that a total order can be imposed on its elements such that every nonempty subset has a first element with respect to that order. The order of a well-ordered set is described by an ordinal number. For instance, 3 is the ordinal number of the set {0, 1, 2} with the usual order 0 < 1 < 2; and ω is the ordinal number of the set of all natural numbers ordered the usual way. Neglecting the order, we are left with the <b>cardinal</b> <b>number</b> |N|nbsp&=nbsp&|ω|nbsp&=nbsp&.|$|E
