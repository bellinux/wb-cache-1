In large cities such as Beijing and Chongqing, people are clearly suffering the adverse health effects of coal-smoke pollution, with PM- 10 and SO 2 as the main pollutants. Natural gas, although not the dominant energy source in China, is becoming one of the most attractive clean substitutes for coal. On one hand, there is widespread disagreement and doubt about the rationale for burning natural gas instead of using it as a raw material in the chemical industry. On the other hand, the economic advantages of natural gas over clean-coal technology are crucial in deciding whether to promote the use of natural gas as a fuel. This research has four goals: Firstly, it quantifies the health damage caused by air pollution, particularly coal burining, in Beijing and Chongqing.

40|$|Development of fueling {{technologies}} for modern and future tokamak reactors {{is essential for}} their implementation in a <b>commercial</b> <b>energy</b> <b>production</b> setting. Compared to the presently available fueling technologies, gas or cryogenic pellet injection, compact torus injection presents an effective and efficient method for directly fueling the central core of tokamak plasmas. Fueling of the central core of a tokamak plasma is pivotal for providing efficient energy production. The central core plasma of a reactor contains the greatest density of fusion processes. For consistent and continuous fueling of tokamak fusion reactors, compact torus injectors must be operated in a repetitive mode. The goal of this thesis was to study the feasibility of firing the University of Saskatchewan Compact Torus Injector (USCTI) in a repetitive mode. In order to enable USCTI to fire repetitively, modifications were made to its electrical system, control system and data acquisition system. These consisted primarily of the addition of new power supplies, to enable fast charging of the many capacitor banks used to form and accelerate the plasma. The maximum firing rate achieved on USCTI was 0. 33 Hz, an increase from the previous maximum firing rate of 0. 2 Hz achieved at UC Davis. Firing USCTI in repetitive modes has been successful. It {{has been shown that}} the CTs produced in any given repetitive series are properly formed and repeatable.

40|$|An {{attractive}} {{feature of}} the inertial fusion energy (IFE) approach to <b>commercial</b> <b>energy</b> <b>production</b> is that the fusion driver is well separated from the fusion confinement chamber. This ''standoff'' feature means the driver is largely isolated from fusion reaction products. Further, inertial confinement fusion (ICF) target ignition (with modest gain) is now scheduled to be demonstrated at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) using a laser driver system. The NIF program will, to a considerable extent, validate indirectly-driven heavy-ion fusion (HIF) target designs for IFE. However, it remains that HIF standoff between the final focus system and the fusion target needs to be seriously addressed. In fact, there now exists a timely opportunity for the Office of Fusion Energy Science (OFES) to experimentally explore the feasibility {{of one of the}} attractive final transport options in the fusion chamber: the self-pinched transport mode. Presently, there are several mainline approaches for HIF beam transport and neutralization in the fusion chamber. These range from the (conservative) vacuum ballistic focus, for which there is much experience from high energy research accelerators, to highly neutralized ballistic focus, which matches well to lower voltage acceleration with resulting lower driver costs. Alternatively, Z-discharge channel transport and self-pinched transport in gas-filled chambers may relax requirements on beam quality and final focusing systems, leading to even lower driver cost. In any case, these alternative methods of transport, especially self-pinched transport, are unusually attractive from the standpoint of chamber design and neutronics. There is no requirement for low chamber pressure. Moreover, only a minuscule fraction of the fusion neutrons can escape from the chamber. Therefore, it is relatively easy to shield sensitive components, e-g., superconducting magnets from any significant neutron flux. Indeed, self-pinched transport and liquid wall protection endow DT fusion with many of the advantages of aneutronic fusion. The question is: will self-pinched transport work? Early theoretical studies indicated that self-pinched transport was not an option because net currents established in gas during beam injection were too small to cause beam pinching. However, recent numerical simulations using the 3 D hybrid code IPROP 3, including the effects of non-local ionization, indicate that self-pinched transport may be possible. The capability to test the concept exists today in scaled experiments using a high-current focused proton beam produced by the Gamble II pulsed-power accelerator at the Naval Research Laboratory. This White Paper describes the implications of the self-pinched transport approach to HIF power plant design and the relevance of proton experiments designed to test the concept. Near-term experiments and analysis are also suggested...|$|E
40|$|The present work is {{the result}} of a three-year Ph. D. {{research}} project carried out at Consorzio RFX on magnetically confined plasmas. Research on controlled thermonuclear fusion is currently being pursued by many countries throughout the world, thanks to its promise of a relatively clean and abundant energy source. The next steps for the international community are the construction and operation of a large device, ITER, considered as the last fusion physics experiment with respect to the tokamak configuration. After ITER, in fact, the first commercial proto-reactor, DEMO, is envisaged to demonstrate the feasibility of fusion as an energy source. The stellarator community, on the other hand, is building a new device, Wendelstein 7 -X, which will provide further insight into three-dimensional physics. Among the various fusion devices, the reversed-field pinch has been demonstrated, if not a viable device for <b>commercial</b> <b>energy</b> <b>production,</b> an excellent tool for plasma physics studies. The RFX-mod experiment situated at Consorzio RFX in Padova, Italy, is the biggest RFP device in the world and the most advanced fusion device with respect to active stabilization of magnetohydrodynamic perturbations through feedback control. The RFX-mod team, further-more, has tackled first theoretically and then experimentally the paramount concept of self-organization in RFPs, which produces enhanced confinement regimes with better transport properties and reduced magnetic chaos. Resonant tearing modes are known to be the biggest players in the dynamo mechanisms responsible for the helically deformed and enhanced regimes. In such a complex framework, the reconstruction of the tearing modes in-side the plasma through external measurements is extremely important for both modelling and experimental reasons since, for example, the structures influencing the core transport properties of plasmas are in part linked to tearing modes. The present Ph. D. thesis focuses, in particular, on the development of two-and three-dimensional equilibrium codes. As a first problem, a Fortran algorithm has been developed for the numerical solution of the helical Grad-Shafranov equation, which is a two-dimensional equilibrium equation derived under the assumption of helical symmetry. Such assumption is found to be particularly appropriate for the study of the dominant tearing mode in RFX-mod during routine quasi-single-helicity phases in RFP shots, but it can be applied to tokamak shots as well. As a second problem, the three-dimensional VMEC/V 3 FIT code suite for equilibrium reconstruction has been analysed and studied. The helical Grad-Shafranov solver has been tested against the three-dimensional VMEC/V 3 FIT predictions, carrying out a valuable benchmark. Then, a further step has been taken in the application of the V 3 FIT code to fixed-boundary reconstructions in RFX-mod by implementing a new virtual diagnostic, which had been previously demonstrated to be able to solve the mismatch in the edge value for the helical safety factor. ...|$|E

The impossibility of meeting such request in an economically feasible and environmentally friendly manner within the existing portfolio of options is now a global self-awareness. The International Energy Agency has been thoroughly documenting through its reports during the last years that the known reserves of natural gas and oil will be exhausted in decades, due to overpopulation and increasing energy demand. Consequently, a crucial issue will soon concern supply problems. This is where the research on fusion as energy source enters the picture. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of fusion as an energy source, the international scientific community has devoted countless efforts to the research on controlled thermonuclear fusion. The main and biggest experiment under construction, ITER, {{is the result of}} the cooperation among many countries throughout the world and it will be a test bench for fusion physics and fusion engineering. Among the different magnetic configurations suitable for fusion devices, the reversed-field pinch has demonstrated to be an excellent tool for plasma physics studies, although it is not accounted as a viable device for <b>commercial</b> <b>energy</b> <b>production.</b> The RFX-mod experiment hosted by Consorzio RFX in Padova is the biggest RFP device in the world. The research activity that will be presented in this thesis has been developed mainly at RFX-mod in Padova but has also involved the participation to an experimental campaign on the COMPASS tokamak in Prague. The research activity that will be presented in this thesis focuses on the characterization of 3 D effects on transport mechanisms at the edge region of fusion plasmas in RFX-mod. The device is highly versatile: it can be operated both in reversed-field pinch and in tokamak magnetic configuration. A detailed description of transport properties at the plasma edge in both configurations will be given in the development of the thesis. The approach that will be followed can be described in terms of a twofold itinerary shared between the investigation of electrostatic fluctuations of transport properties through insertable probes and the study of magnetic topology modifications due to spontaneous 3 D processes. The thesis is organized as follows: Part I, Introduction. In the first part of the thesis, all the background information needed for the development of the work will be introduced. In chapter 1 the concept of plasma and fusion physics will be discussed together with a detailed description of the two magnetic configurations for fusion devices relevant for analyses: reversed-field pinch (RFP) and tokamak. In chapter 2 the RFP dynamics will be described in details by introducing Taylor relaxation theory and the two main topologies also experimentally observed: the Single Helicity (SH) and the Multiple Helicity (MH) states. Then, RFX-mod edge region will be specifically described and the main tools used in the analyses will be introduced. The chapter will close with the introduction of a comparison between RFP and tokamak’s edge region through the analogy of a common 3 D structure when external magnetic perturbations are applied. Part II, Transport analysis. In chapter 3 the two experimental configurations in which RFX-mod operates will be presented. The insertable U-probe used in the experiments will be described together with the theory upon which the collection of measurements relies. The investigation of electrostatic fluctuations of transport properties at the edge will be discussed. Studies on transport mechanism around different topological regions in presence of an externally applied magnetic perturbation will be shown for both reversed-field pinch and tokamak configuration in the RFX-mod device. Part III, Topology analysis. The study of magnetic topology modifications develops through analyses of spontaneous magnetic reconnection events in reversed-field pinch magnetic configuration. In chapter 4 reconnection models will be briefly discussed. Then, crash events in RFX-mod will be presented and the adopted analysis technique will be thoroughly explored. In the second part of the chapter the ion energy analyzer will be described together with its application in measurements of ion temperature profile in COMPASS tokamakand in RFX-mod. Part IV, Conclusions. In chapter 5 the results of the thesis are collected and discussed. In conclusion, a section entitled Summary and future perspectives is added where the main results are tautly summarized in view of future perspectives of research. Part V, Appendixes.

There have already been many investigations of risk perception related to <b>energy</b> <b>production....</b> The present study is a direct extension of the Mullet study. A similar, although more complete, set of items was used. These items related to specific energy domains as well as specific aspects of the <b>energy</b> <b>production</b> process. As in the Mullet study, nine energy sources (covering all currently known energy sources), were considered in this study: Wood and bio-mass, coal, gas, oil, nuclear, water, wind, geothermal, and solar. Also, nine stages in the <b>energy</b> <b>production</b> and utilization process were considered: obtaining raw materials, storage of raw materials, transportation of raw materials, <b>energy</b> <b>production,</b> waste products related to <b>energy</b> <b>production,</b> transportation of <b>energy,</b> transportation of waste products, the storage of waste products, and utilization of <b>energy.</b> Crossover of <b>production</b> phases and <b>energy</b> types resulted in a large number of items. ...|$|R
