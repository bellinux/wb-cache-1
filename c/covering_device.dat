40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the performance of seed drill with different covering devices of wheat seeds. The parameters used for evaluation were draft, seed depth, fuel consumption, number of plants/mt, power requirement and length of plant root. The experiment was designed as split plot and the main plot was the seed covering devices and the sub plot was forward speed. An instrumented tractor was used that consisted of sensitive sensors and a datalogger for measuring and recording performance parameters including fuel consumption, tractor forward speed and draft. Experiments were conducted with four types of seed covering devices named: spike tooth, wooden sweep, chains and smooth plastic wheel. Seed drill performance parameters were measured at various forward speeds (5. 94, 6. 53 and 7. 65 kmIh) and the planting depth was adjusted on 50 mm before planting. The results showed that there were significant differences among the used seed covering devices and forward speeds for all performance parameters were found. The spike tooth seed <b>covering</b> <b>device</b> had the smallest average value of draft compared with the other seed covering devices and was equal to 3. 85 kN as average for three forward speeds. On the other hand, the smooth plastic wheel seed <b>covering</b> <b>device</b> had the smallest average values of fuel consumption and seed depth, and big~est average values of length of plant root and number of plants/m compared with the other seed covering devices and were equal to 16. 36 litlh, 53. 11 rnm, 94. 3 rnm, and 174 plants/m' respectively as average for the three forward speeds...|$|E

Post-Stuxnet works have included a plethora of ICS focused cyber secu- rity research activities, with topics <b>covering</b> <b>device</b> maturity, network protocols, and overall cyber security culture. We often hear the notion of ICSs being highly vulnerable {{due to a lack of}} inbuilt security mechanisms, considered a low hanging fruit to a variety of low skilled threat actors. While there is substantial evidence to support such a notion, when considering targeted attacks on ICS, it is hard to believe an attacker with limited resources, such as a script kiddie or hacktivist, using publicly accessible tools and exploits alone, would have adequate knowledge and resources to achieve targeted operational process manipulation, while simultaneously evade detection. Through use of a testbed environment, this paper provides two practical examples based on a Man-In-The-Middle scenario, demonstrating the types of information an attacker would need obtain, collate, and comprehend, in order to begin targeted process manipulation and detection avoidance. This allows for a clearer view of associated challenges, and illustrate why targeted ICS exploitation might not be possible for every malicious actor...|$|E

40|$|Currently used {{conventional}} tillage systems for small-scale vegetable {{production in the}} region of Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico require a considerable amount of hand labor, energy and materials for all activities. Seedbed preparation can require up to 60 % of the total production cost in some systems in Mexico. Further, soil is degraded and eroded due to the system. Conservation tillage may reduce costs and prevent soil degradation, but appropriate tools, such as, no-tillage seeders for small-scale farmers are not available. This papers reports on the design and construction of a prototype of a no-tillage seeder for small-scale conservation tillage using a 2 -wheeled tractor. Three main functions received particular attention: opening of the soil, placing seed and/or fertilizer and closing the slot. Because of its vapor conservation and good seedling emergence, tools to create T-shaped slots were chosen, with adapted depth control and closing and <b>covering</b> <b>devices.</b> A systematic design process was applied in order to reach the required decisions. Function diagrams were defined from where morphologic charts guided the selection of the configuration of the seeder. A preliminary evaluation included testing of two furrow opener disc types (notched and fluted), and four crop residue levels, 0, 30, 60 and 100 %, with respect to performance of the seeder. An evaluation showed that with low cover amounts a consistent and firm seed cover was obtained, but emergence quality decreased due to insufficient residue cover. The notched disc had a better performance than the fluted disc. The inverted T-shape in the soil was not always sustained due to technical flaws. It was possible to build a prototype under 2000 dollars with basic tools in a local workshop.
