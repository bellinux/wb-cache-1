5|$|Like {{the other}} carbon–halogen bonds, the C–Cl bond {{is a common}} {{functional}} group that forms part of core organic chemistry. Formally, compounds with this functional group may be considered organic derivatives of the chloride anion. Due to the difference of electronegativity between chlorine (3.16) and carbon (2.55), the carbon in a C–Cl bond is electron-deficient and thus electrophilic. Chlorination modifies the physical properties of hydrocarbons in several ways: <b>chlorocarbons</b> are typically denser than water due to the higher atomic weight of chlorine versus hydrogen, and aliphatic organochlorides are alkylating agents because chloride is a leaving group.|$|E
25|$|NH2Cl is {{commonly}} used in low concentrations as a secondary disinfectant in municipal water distribution systems {{as an alternative to}} chlorination. This application is increasing. Chlorine (referred to in water treatment as free chlorine) is being displaced by chloramine—to be specific monochloramine—which is much more stable and does not dissipate as rapidly as free chlorine. NH2Cl also has a much lower, however still present, tendency than free chlorine to convert organic materials into <b>chlorocarbons</b> such as chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. Such compounds have been identified as carcinogens and in 1979 the United States Environmental Protection Agency began regulating their levels in U.S. drinking water.|$|E

Surfactants are a minor application but generate over $1 {{billion in annual}} revenue. Due to the danger from direct hydrocarbon–fluorine reactions above −150°C (−240°F), industrial fluorocarbon production is indirect, mostly through halogen exchange reactions such as Swarts fluorination, in which <b>chlorocarbon</b> chlorines are substituted for fluorines by hydrogen fluoride under catalysts.

40|$|For many years, {{chlorofluorocarbon}} (CFC) and <b>chlorocarbon</b> solvents {{have played}} {{an important part in}} aerospace operations. These solvents found extensive use as cleaning and analysis (EPA) solvents in precision and critical cleaning. However, CFCs and <b>chlorocarbon</b> solvents have deleterious effects on the ozone layer, are relatively strong greenhouse gases, and some are suspect or known carcinogens. Because of their ozone-depletion potential (ODP), the Montreal Protocol and its amendments, as well as other environmental regulations, have resulted in the phaseout of CFC- 113 and 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane (TCA). Although alternatives have been recommended, they do not perform as well as the original solvents. In addition, some analyses, such as the infrared analysis of extracted hydrocarbons, cannot be performed with the substitute solvents that contain C-H bonds. CFC- 113 solvent has been used for many critical aerospace applications. CFC- 113, also known as Freon (registered) TF, has been used extensively in NASA's cleaning facilities for precision and critical cleaning, in particular the final rinsing in Class 100 areas, with gas chromatography analysis of rinse residue. While some cleaning can be accomplished by other processes, there are certain critical applications where CFC- 113 or a similar solvent is highly cost-effective and ensures safety. Oxygen system components are one example where a solvent compatible with oxygen and capable of removing fluorocarbon grease is needed. Electronic components and precision mechanical components can also be damaged by aggressive cleaning solvents...|$|R

The measurements confirm the predominance of human activity in the atmospheric budget of organic chlorine, and allow the estimation of atmospheric histories of halogenated gases of combined anthropogenic and natural origin. The pre-twentieth-century burden of methyl chloride was close to that at present, while the burden of methyl bromide was probably over half of today's value...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The four {{chlorinated}} methanes, {{methyl chloride}} (CH 3 Cl), methylene chloride (CH 2 Cl 2), chloroform (CHCl 3), and carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4), {{were used as}} model <b>chlorocarbon</b> systems with Cl/H ratios of 0. 021 to 0. 083 to investigate the thermal stability and hydrodechlorination of chloromethanes in excess hydrogen. The pyrolytic reactions were studied in an isothermal tubular reactor at a total pressure of 1 atm with reaction times of 0. 3 ∼ 2. 0 s at temperatures between 525 and 900 oC. The thermal stabilities of the chloromethanes, i. e., the temperatures for 99 % destruction within a reaction time of 1 s were 875 oC for CH 3 Cl, 780 oC for CH 2 Cl 2, 675 oC for CHCl 3, and 635 oC for CCl 4. The less-chlorinated hydrocarbons were more stable, with CH 3 Cl the most stable <b>chlorocarbon</b> in this reaction system. This work focused on pyrolysis of CH 3 Cl in an ex-cess-hydrogen reaction atmosphere. The observed hydrodechlorinated products were CH 4, C 2 H 4, and C 2 H 6 at temperatures above 850 oC in the CH 3 Cl/H 2 reaction system. The number and quantities of intermediate chlori-nated products decreased with increasing temperature; the formation of non-chlorinated hydrocarbons in-creased as the temperature rose. One of main pathways for hydrodechlorinated products resulted from H atom cyclic chain reaction by abstraction. Product distributions along with preliminary activation energies and rate constants are reported. The pyrolytic reaction pathways that describe the important features of reagent decay and intermediate product distributions, based upon thermochemical and kinetic principles, are suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of UV diamond photocathodes in gaseous environments has been explored {{with regard to}} the potential applications, which exist for such devices. Stable performance is exhibited even at gas pressures approximately 0. 5 bar for hydrogenated diamond, in gaseous environments such as He, H 2, O 2, CH 4 and CF 4. However, for <b>chlorocarbon</b> gases, UV stimulated photodissociation of the ambient gas causes the adsorption of chlorine on the diamond surface, and rapidly degrades device performance. Thermal dissociation of ambient gases brings about a similar effect. Thus, although diamond photocathodes do have potential use in gaseous environments, it is clear that care is required to ensure that the hydrogenated surface layer is not destroyed when in use. © 2003 Elsevier B.

40|$|Hydrodechlorination is a {{promising}} method for treating toxic <b>chlorocarbon</b> compounds. Pd {{is among the}} most effective catalysts for chloroform hydrodechlorination, and experiments have shown that the Pd-Au alloy catalyst yields superior catalytic performance over pure Pd. Here we examine the chloroform hydrodechlorination mechanism over Pd(111) and Pd-ML/Au(111) surfaces using periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations (DFT, GGA-PW 91) and maximum rate analysis. We suggest that the reaction occurs on both surfaces through complete dechlorination of chloroform followed by hydrogenation of CH* to methane, and that the initial dechlorination step is likely the rate-limiting step. On Pd(111), the chloroform dechlorination barrier is 0. 24 eV higher than the desorption barrier, whereas on Pd-ML/Au(111), the chloroform dechlorination barrier is 0. 07 eV lower than the desorption barrier, which can explain the higher hydrodechlorination activity of the Pd-Au alloy catalyst...|$|R

40|$|Characterization of {{glovebox}} atmospheres and {{the black}} reaction product formed on plutonium surfaces shows that the abnormally rapid corrosion of components in the fabrication line {{is consistent with a}} complex salt-catalyzed reaction involving gaseous hydrogen chloride (HCl) and water. Analytical data verify that <b>chlorocarbon</b> and HCl vapors are presented in stagnant glovebox atmospheres. Hydrogen chloride concentrations approach 7 ppm at some locations in the glovebox line. The black corrosion product is identified as plutonium monoxide monohydride (PuOH), a product formed by hydrolysis of plutonium in liquid water and salt solutions at room temperature. Plutonium trichloride (PuCl{sub 3 }) produced by reaction of HCl at the metal surface is deliquescent and apparently forms a highly concentrated salt solution by absorbing moisture from the glovebox atmosphere.

All solids were active in cyclooctene epoxidation (conversion up to 100 %; epoxide selectivity 100 %; TOF 2 – 4 h− 1 anion− 1). The degree of surface coverage by organic functions was crucial for recycling performance. Catalysts with low densities of organic functions and hydrophilic surfaces were easily deactivated.
