But this time I’m realizing that people <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> life for a season, and my last relationship served its purpose. I can’t sit here and cry about it, because it ended right where it should have. A lot of that stuff is on the album.|$|E
500|$|The subplot of Homer {{entering}} the childproofing business {{was inspired by}} an instance when a salesman visited Payne and his pregnant wife to see if their home was safe for children. In an interview with Star-News, Payne commented: [...] "You hire this person to <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> home to look for changes you can make. They {{make you feel like}} the most horrible person in the world and that your house is the temple of doom." [...] "Bye Bye Nerdie" [...] features a scene based specifically on this instance in which a saleswoman (voiced by cast member Tress MacNeille) selling childproofing items visits Homer and Marge and exaggerates the dangers in their home. NRBQ's song [...] "Always Safety First" [...] is played during a montage in the episode in which Homer is seen improving the safety of the infants of Springfield.|$|E
500|$|When we now {{heard many}} {{disputes}} about the inheritance, I brought King Æthelwulf's will to our assembly at Langandene, {{and it was}} read before all the councillors of the West Saxons. When it had been read, I urged them all for love of me– and gave them my pledge that I would never bear a grudge against {{any one of them}} because they declared what was right– that none of them would hesitate, either for love or fear of me, to expound the common law, lest any man should say that I had treated my young kinsmen wrongfully, the older or the younger. And then they all pronounced what was right, and said that they could not conceive any juster title, nor could they find one in the will. [...] "Now everything has <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> possession, and you may bequeath it or give it into the hand of kinsman or stranger, whichever you prefer." ...|$|E

500|$|Bosworth {{was cast}} as {{reporter}} Lois Lane in Bryan Singer's superhero film Superman Returns (2006). She starred {{along with her}} Beyond the Sea co-star Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, as well as newcomer Brandon Routh as Superman. The film was a box office success and received mostly positive reviews. Bosworth's performance however, was not well received among critics; Anthony Lane of The New Yorker noted, [...] "The new Lois Lane, Kate Bosworth, is not a patch on Margot Kidder, or, for that matter, on Teri Hatcher, in the [...]" [...] San Francisco Chronicle film critic Mick LaSalle felt that Bosworth, {{at the age of}} 22 years, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the climax did not [...] "match the potential of the tiring 154 minute long film". Although Bosworth's performance was ambivalently received, she herself loved the experience of working on the movie. As she told Teen Vogue in August 2006, [...] "You know how you have an experience, a time in your life when you feel you've <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> own? When you grow up a bit, and think, Now I get it? [...] That's how I feel. I feel a little bit more complete." [...] The movie grossed $52million during its opening weekend in North America and went on to earn $391million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|The British force {{fighting}} in Mesopotamia was principally {{drawn from the}} British Indian Army, with only one solely British formation, the 13th (Western) Division. Its objective was to secure the Royal Navy's oil supply from Persia. On 7 November 1914, the British Indian force—led by General Sir John Nixon—invaded Mesopotamia, and on 23 November, entered Basrah. After this initial invasion, there followed a disastrous and humiliating defeat for the British by the Turks at the Siege of Kut-al-Amara from 7 December 1915 – 29 April 1916, when the entire garrison of 13,000 British and Indian troops surrendered. The British reorganised and raised the number of available troops to 250,000. The British eventually regained momentum upon General Frederick Stanley Maude becoming commander, and a new offensive began in December 1916. On 24 February 1917, Kut-al-Amara fell to the joint British and Indian force, and Baghdad was captured in March 1917. A week after the capture of Baghdad, General Maude issued the Proclamation of Baghdad, which contained the famous line, [...] "our armies do not <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> cities and lands as conquerors or enemies, but as liberators". Lieutenant General Sir William Marshall succeeded Maude following the latter's death from cholera on 18 November 1917. He continued with the River War until October 1918, when the British captured the Mosul oil fields, a development {{that led to the}} collapse of the Turkish forces. The Armistice of Mudros with Turkey was signed on 30 October 1918. During the campaign, 100,000 British and Indian casualties were caused. Of these, 53,000 died, with 13,000 of the dead succumbing to disease.|$|E

2500|$|By early March, the British {{were at the}} {{outskirts}} of Baghdad, and the Baghdad garrison, under the direct command of the Governor of Baghdad province Halil Kut (Khalil Pasha), tried to stop them on the Diyala river. General Maude outmanoeuvered the Ottoman forces, destroyed an Ottoman regiment and captured the Ottoman defensive positions. Khalil Pasha retreated in disarray out of the city. On 11 March 1917, the British entered Baghdad where they were greeted as liberators. The British Indian Army {{played a significant role}} in the liberation of Baghdad. Amidst the confusion of the retreat a large part of the Ottoman army (some 15,000 soldiers) were captured. A week after the city fell, General Maude issued the oft-quoted , which contained the famous line [...] "our armies do not <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> cities and lands as conquerors or enemies, but as liberators".|$|E
2500|$|Hecklers {{interrupted}} Oren's speech ten times, {{with many}} students cheering them in support. Among other slogans, the hecklers yelled, [...] "Michael Oren, propagating murder {{is not an}} expression of free speech," [...] "killers" [...] and [...] "how many Palestinians did you kill?" [...] After the fourth disruption, Oren took a 20-minute leave {{before returning to the}} podium. Before continuing he said, [...] "I've spent most of my life living in and studying the Middle East and one of the great and eternal cultural facets of the Middle East is hospitality... even if you do not agree with them, even if they're ostensibly your enemy. I'm your guest here and I'm asking for the Middle Eastern hospitality for your guest, I've <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> house." [...] By the end of the program, 11 UC Irvine and Riverside students were reportedly arrested.|$|E
