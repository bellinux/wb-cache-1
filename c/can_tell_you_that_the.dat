2500|$|On June 13, 2006, {{prosecutors}} determined {{there was}} no cause to charge Rove with any wrongdoing. Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald stated previously that [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> substantial bulk {{of the work of}} this investigation is concluded." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the middle}} of the {{controversy}} about Lindner’s remarks his lawyer sent a routine legal request for discovery to Rep. Neva Walker, an African-American DFL member from Minneapolis. The letter was addressed to her as “Walker-Black”. Walker had never been married, didn’t use a hyphenated name, and had never had the last name Black. It appeared as if someone forgot to remove the race notation before signing and sending out that letter. James Anderson, Lindner's lawyer, apologized to Walker saying it was a [...] "simple mistake. [...] I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> person typing the letter apparently looked at the file and put the words together wrong [...]” Walker said [...] "I do believe it was an accident and somebody forgot to erase it. ...I am an elected official and I deserve respect, and that misprint is a lack of respect." [...] The lawyer said [...] "Basically, it's a tempest in a teapot," [...] he said, adding that [...] "some people are just hypersensitive if from a simple mistake they can call someone a racist." [...] Walker responded, [...] "It's easy to say that when you're not on the receiving of a racist comment, but racist attacks are emotionally and mentally draining. And I am far from sensitive. It takes a lot to offend me. ...Folks who are so focused on this issue don't realize that there is a pattern with this particular representative." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "There {{are a lot}} {{of great}} {{technicians}} in advertising. And unfortunately they talk the best game. They know all the rules. They <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> people in an ad will get you greater readership. They <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> a sentence should be this short or <b>that</b> long. They <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> body copy should be broken up for easier reading. They can give you fact after fact after fact. They are the scientists of advertising. But there's one little rub. Advertising is fundamentally persuasion and persuasion happens to be not a science, but an art." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, {{whether that}} is so or not, Mr. Bullen, I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> affair has very greatly raised you in our esteem. We all liked you before; but we really did regard you only as a young officer who had proved that he possessed an {{uncommon}} amount of pluck and determination. In future, we shall regard you as a gentleman who was ready to take no inconsiderable risk {{on behalf of a}} fellow officer." ...|$|E
6000|$|Grace {{had looked}} at the {{handkerchief}}. [...] "Very well," [...] she said, with coldness. [...] "I shall not stand in your way of calling another physician. But if it will console you, I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> blood on your handkerchief means nothing worth speaking of. Whom shall I send for?" [...] she asked, turning {{to go out of}} the roam. [...] "I wish to be your friend still, and I will do anything I can to help you." ...|$|E
60|$|THE STATUE. [chuckling] I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that,</b> my dear. It's because {{heaven is}} the most angelically dull place in all creation: that's why.|$|R

6000|$|... "There's some I don't {{want to see}} {{the inside}} of any more. I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that.</b> How are these new {{householders}} going to vote?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Poor Lily!' said Claude. 'It {{is a bad}} prospect, but I {{think you}} see the worst side of it. You are not well, and, therefore, doleful. This, Lily, I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Baron always {{considered}} Emily's government {{as a kind of}} experiment, and so perhaps he will not be so grievously disappointed as you expect. Besides, I have a strong suspicion that Emily's own nature has quite {{as much to do with}} her present conduct as your principle, which, after all, did not live very long.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Without {{alluding}} to Mr. Bowmore's politics," [...] he went on, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> motive of everything {{he says and}} does is vanity. To the gratification of that one passion he would sacrifice you or me, his wife or his daughter, without hesitation and without remorse. His one desire is to get into Parliament. You are wealthy, and you can help him. He will leave no effort untried to reach that end; and, if he gets you into political difficulties, he will desert you without scruple." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, my dear fellow," [...] Colonel Mahon said, {{giving him}} a hearty slap on the shoulder, [...] "allow me to congratulate you. I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> title has been in abeyance, for the past {{fourteen}} years. Everyone knows the facts. Your grandfather died before the Marquis. Your uncle succeeded him, lived only three years and, being unmarried, your father became the next Earl; and has been advertised for, in vain, ever since. As, unhappily, your father is dead also, you are unquestionably the Marquis of Langdale." ...|$|E
6000|$|But <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> me so {{much more}} about them than I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> why should I tire you with my {{accounts}} and descriptions? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{you are not}} satisfied," [...] {{he said to the}} fellow, [...] "you can go to Prome, {{and appeal}} to the general there; but I warn you that, if you do, you must give notice to the villagers of your {{intention}} so that they may, if they choose, send two or three of their number to repeat the evidence that they have given me. I have noted this fully down, and I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> general, when he reads it, will be much more likely to order you a sound flogging, than to reinstate you in your office." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have already}} a gentleman named as staff {{interpreter}}, Mr. Hilliard, but I can appoint you, at once, interpreter to the quartermaster's department, attached to my personal staff for the present. I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Egyptian army will be largely increased, and I shall be able, after a time, to procure {{you a better}} appointment. When we have once defeated the Mahdi, and restored order, {{there will be many}} appointments open for the reorganization of the Soudan. There are a good many preparations to be made, before I leave, which I expect to do in the course of three or four weeks; and I shall be glad of your assistance, {{as soon as you can}} join us." ...|$|E
60|$|The Grimsel is CERTAINEMENT a {{wonderful}} place; {{situated at the}} bottom of a sort of huge crater, the sides of which are utterly savage GEBIRGE, composed of barren rocks which cannot even support a single pine ARBRE, and afford only scanty food for a herd of GMWKWLLOLP, it looks as if it must be completely BEGRABEN in the winter snows. Enormous avalanches fall against it every spring, sometimes covering everything to the depth of thirty or forty feet; and, in spite of walls four feet thick, and furnished with outside shutters, the two men who stay here when the VOYAGEURS are snugly quartered in their distant homes <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> snow sometimes shakes the house to its foundations.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} doctor, slowly, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> may say good-bye for ever to your best lighter, {{and to the}} Capataz of Cargadores." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "How? I {{shall have}} to be plain with you, I see. Perhaps I have not {{considered}} that, after all, you know nothing about life and are not to blame for things that a person born and bred {{in the world would}} understand from childhood. If you don't know already, I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> way you have behaved with Lord Lioncourt during {{the last two or three}} days, and the way you showed your pleasure the other night in his ridiculous flatteries of you, was enough to make you the talk of the whole steamer. I advise you for your own sake to take my warning in time. You are very young, and inexperienced and ignorant, but that will not save you in the eyes of the world if you keep on." [...] Mrs. Milray rose. [...] "And now I will leave you to think of what I have said. Here is the letter for Miss Milray--" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} well to draw {{pictures}} of him, and sing songs about him, and make {{as though he were}} an impostor; but I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fear of that man hung like a black shadow over all Europe, and that {{there was a time when}} the glint of a fire at night upon the coast would set every woman upon her knees and every man gripping for his musket. He had always won: that was the terror of it. The Fates seemed to be behind him. And now we knew that he lay upon the northern coast with a hundred and fifty thousand veterans, and the boats for their passage. But it is an old story, how a third of the grown folk of our country took up arms, and how our little one-eyed, one-armed man crushed their fleet. There was still to be a land of free thinking and free speaking in Europe.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is nothing," [...] Adolphe replied confidently. [...] "After yesterday's {{work there}} is not a sailor or {{fisherman}} in the port but would do all he could to help people to escape from the hands of the butchers, and once on board, it will help you. You may be sure the sailors will do their best to run away if they can, or to hide any on board, should they be overhauled, now they know that they will be guillotined if anyone is found. However, our captain has made the agreement, and {{he is a man of}} his word; besides, he hates the Reds. I have been helping ship the casks to-day, and we have stowed them so as to leave space into which your sisters can crawl and the entrance be stopped up with casks, if we should be overhauled. As for you, monsieur, you will pass anywhere as one of the crew, and we have arranged that one of the men shall at the last moment stay behind, so that the number will be right, and you will answer to his name. We have thought matters over, you see, and I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> captain does it more because he hates the Reds than for the money. The day before, he would give me no answer. He said he thought the risk was too great; but when I saw him last night he was a different man altogether. His face was as white as a sheet, and his eyes seemed on fire, and he said, 'I will take your friends, Adolphe. I would take them without a penny. I should never sleep again if, owing to me, they fell into the hands of these monsters.' So you see he is in it heart and soul." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that.</b> There is {{only one}} thing they can think. How these people will hate you {{who are trying to}} make {{mischief}} between France and England!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} must {{do what you want}} to," [...] he acquiesced sullenly, [...] "but you'll have to answer for it--I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that.</b> It's a damnable liberty!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't talk of it! Now it's all settled, Jamie, I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I'd sooner see {{you dead}} {{at my feet}} than <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should break your word to Mary." ...|$|R
60|$|How, then, has {{the world}} at large fallen into the pardonable error of believing {{tropical}} nature to be so rich in colouring, and circumpolar nature to be so dingy and unlovable? Simply thus, I believe. The tropics embrace the largest land areas in the world, and are richer by a thousand times in species of plants and animals than {{all the rest of the}} earth in a lump put together. That richness necessarily results from the fierceness of the competition. Now among this enormous mass of tropical plants it naturally happens that some have finer flowers than any temperate species; while as to the animals and birds, they are undoubtedly, on the whole, both larger and handsomer than the fauna of colder climates. But in the general aspect of tropical nature an occasional bright flower or brilliant parrot counts for very little among the mass of lush green which surrounds and conceals it. On the other hand, in our museums and conservatories we sedulously pick out the rarest and most beautiful of these rare and beautiful species, and we isolate them completely from their natural surroundings. The consequence is that the untravelled mind regards the tropics mentally as a sort of perpetual replica of the hot-houses at Kew, superimposed on the best of Mr. Bull's orchid shows. As a matter of fact, people who know the hot world well <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> average tropical woodland is much more like the dark shade of Box Hill or the deepest glades of the Black Forest. For really fine floral display in the mass, all at once, you must go, not to Ceylon, Sumatra, Jamaica, but to the far north of Canada, the Bernese Oberland, the moors of Inverness-shire, the North Cape of Norway. Flowers are loveliest where the climate is coldest; forests are greenest, most luxuriant, least blossoming, where the conditions of life are richest, warmest, fiercest. In one word, High Life is always poor but beautiful.|$|E
6000|$|The home letter, {{finished}} the last, had been begun before the first, on Feb. 11, 'My birthday,' as the Bishop writes, adding:--'How {{as time goes}} on we think more and more of him and miss him. Especially now in these times, with so many difficult questions distressing and perplexing men, his wise calm judgment would have been such a strength and support. You know I have all his letters since I left England, and he never missed a mail. And now it is nearly ten years since he passed away from this world. What would he say to us all? What would he think of all that has taken place in the interval? Thank God, he would certainly rejoice in seeing all his children loving each other more and more as they grow older and learn from experience the blessedness and infrequency of such a thoroughly united, happy set of brothers and sisters. Why, you have never missed a single mail in all these sixteen years; and I know, in spite of occasional differences of opinion, that there is really more than ever of mutual love, and much more of mutual esteem than ever. There is no blessing like this. And it is a special and unusual blessing. And surely, next to God, we owe it to our dear parents, and perhaps especially to him who was the one to live on as we grew up into men and women. What should I have done out here without a perfect trust in you three, and without your letters and loving remembrances in boxes, &c.? I fancy that I should have broken down altogether, or else have hardened (more than I have become) to the soft and restful influences of the home life. I see some people really alone in these countries, really expatriated. Now I never feel that; partly because I have your letters, partly because I have the knowledge that, if ever I did have to go to England, I should find all the old family love, only intensified and deepened. I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> consciousness of all this is a great help, and carries one along famously. And then the hope of meeting by-and-by and for ever!' ...|$|E
