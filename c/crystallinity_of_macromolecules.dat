40|$|In vivo {{localized}} proton {{magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy (1 H MRS) became a powerful and unique technique to non-invasively investigate brain metabolism of rodents and humans. The main goal of 1 H MRS is the reliable quantification of concentrations of metabolites (neurochemical profile) in a well-defined region of the brain. The availability of very high magnetic field strengths combined {{with the possibility of}} acquiring spectra at very short echo time have dramatically increased the number of constituents of the neurochemical profile. The quantification of spectra measured at short echo times is complicated by the presence <b>of</b> <b>macromolecule</b> signals <b>of</b> particular importance at high magnetic fields. An error in the macromolecule estimation can lead to substantial errors in the obtained neurochemical profile. The purpose of the present review is to overview methods of high field 1 H MRS with a focus on the metabolite quantification, in particular in handling signals <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules.</b> Three main approaches of handling signals <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules</b> are described, namely mathematical estimation <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules,</b> measurement <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules</b> in vivo, and direct acquisition of the in vivo spectrum without the contribution <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules...</b>|$|R

30|$|It {{is known}} that the {{kinetics}} of electron transport in the RCs of purple bacteria [1 – 3] and {{the shape of the}} curve of chlorophyll fluorescence in the complex of photosystem II in thylakoid grana are multiexponential in nature [4]. As a rule, this is explained by a multilevel organizational structure <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules</b> and a manifestation of self-regulation effect on the structural and dynamic properties <b>of</b> biological <b>macromolecules</b> in non-equilibrium operating conditions. This effect is determined by certain hidden parameters among which structural variables that characterize the state <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules</b> can act. While these parameters are difficult to measure directly in experiment, they impact the kinetics of basic reaction in macromolecules along with control parameters (substrate concentration, light intensity, etc.). Due to changes in the structure <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules,</b> a feedback in the basic reaction occurs. This feedback links the recurring elementary acts of the basic reaction. The elementary acts lead to significant changes in the structure <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules.</b> They modify the very elementary reaction and provide adaptive functioning <b>of</b> the <b>macromolecules.</b> The effect <b>of</b> self-regulation can occur with different amounts of structural variables. These factors make it difficult to analyze the basic reaction, and the kinetics of this reaction assumes a multiexponential character. Therefore, there is a problem, using the experimentally measured kinetics of basic reaction, to identify the stationary states and self-consistent reorganizations <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules,</b> which are reflected by monoexponential components of the basic reaction.|$|R
