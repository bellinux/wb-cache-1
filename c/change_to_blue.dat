2500|$|Goku {{is usually}} {{recognized}} by his unique hairstyle, {{which does not}} change in length except in his Super Saiyan forms, where his hair changes in color and length according to the form he takes. This is explained by Vegeta to be a common characteristic of full-blooded Saiyans. Goku's hair color changes from black to golden after ascending to a Super Saiyan, and his irises change from black to turquoise. In his Super Saiyan God form, both his hair color and irises change to a deep red. In his Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form, both his hair color and irises <b>change</b> <b>to</b> <b>blue</b> (hence its nickname [...] "Super Saiyan Blue"). In Dragon Ball GT, he has a noticeably darker skin complexion in his regular form. Goku prefers dressing in a dōgi uniform to show his devotion to Earth, instead of the standard battle fatigues of his race; {{the only time he}} actually does wear these garments is during his training with Gohan before the Cell Games.|$|E

50|$|Sometimes, it is {{possible}} to detect growth on the Simmons' citrate agar without the accompanying color <b>change</b> <b>to</b> <b>blue.</b> This should be scored as a negative for the citrate use test.Bacteria such as Salmonella and Providencia develop on such mediums.|$|E
50|$|Use of citrate {{results in}} the {{creation}} of carbonates and bicarbonates as byproducts. Organisms degrading citrate must also use the ammonium salts, producing ammonia, thus increasing the pH of the medium. The increase in pH then causes color change in the bromothymol blue indicator, turning it blue. Under neutral conditions the medium remains a green color. The color <b>change</b> <b>to</b> <b>blue</b> is useful because growth on Simmons' citrate agar is often limited and would be hard to observe {{if it were not for}} the color change.|$|E

50|$|In the 2015 off-season, BC Prienai {{announced}} a sponsorship deal with Birštonas mineral water company, will be changing their name to BC Birštono Vytautas for sponsorship reasons and also bringing back head coach Virginijus Šeškus. Having proper sponsorship, the club hopes {{to return to}} their competitive ways in the upcoming season. It was later corrected that the name will be BC Vytautas and that the club is going to be shared with the neighboring city of Birštonas, which hopefully would also expand the fanbase. Furthermore, on July 29, 2015, the club was invited to join the 2015-16 FIBA Europe Cup tournament, which is the alternative version of the 2nd tier European tournament Eurocup, organized by FIBA. Although, just before the drawing ceremony, it was announced that 56 teams will participate instead of 64 and Vytautas is not one of these 56. In this off-season BC Vytautas brought back former players Povilas Butkevičius, Vaidas Čepukaitis and Laimonas Kisielius, also resigning Prienai natives Domantas Šeškus, Paulius Ivanauskas and bringing in major reinforcement with Šarūnas Vasiliauskas, Vilmantas Dilys, Vytautas Šulskis, Gytis Sirutavičius. On 16 September 2015, Prienai announced their new logo and color <b>change</b> <b>to</b> <b>blue</b> and white as part of the sponsorship deal, though blue has been a traditional sports team color in the Prienai-Birštonas area.|$|E
50|$|The cap is {{initially}} globular before expanding to become convex and flattening somewhat; it grows to {{a diameter of}} 2 - 6 cm. The cap margin initially adheres to the stipe and {{has a tendency to}} become lobed or undulated in age. The cap surface is first somewhat pubescent but later becomes smooth and hairless, and may develop cracks in age. Its color is orangish-apricot, aging to ochre. Tubes are initially pale yellow, but become more vivid in age, and eventually develop greenish-yellow to greenish-olive tones. They will become pale blue upon with bruising. The pores are circular or a bit angular, with the same coloring and bruising reaction as the tubes. The robust stipe measures 3 - 8 cm long by 0.5 - 1.5 cm thick. It is usually thicker in the middle or lower region, and its base roots into the substrate. The top part of the stipe is yellow; under this the coloration tends to be masked by a dense and fine reticulation that becomes brown to brownish-crimson in age. In some specimens the stipe cuticle cracks and pointed patches lift from the surface. The flesh is pale yellow in the cap, with a narrow strip of pinkish-yellow under the cuticle; in the stipe, the flesh is orange-ochre, with a reddish tint. The flesh sometimes shows a slight and temporary color <b>change</b> <b>to</b> <b>blue</b> when cut or otherwise injured, but this feature is not consistent. It has a pleasant odor and a fruity-acid taste.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a novel strategy to fabricate a well-defined polydiacetylene (PDA) supramolecular pattern on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane utilizing a DNA bio-photomask. By focusing on that, the absorption spectrum of DNA molecules having a λmax at 260 nm overlaps with the wavelength {{at which the}} photopolymerization of the diacetylene monomer occurs, DNA molecules are used to define specific patterns on PVDF membranes coated with diacetylene lipids by shielding the applied 254 nm UV light and consequently preventing the photopolymerization of the lipids. As a result, the DNA-covered regions retain the original white color on the membrane while the regions uncovered by DNA molecules undergo the color <b>change</b> <b>to</b> <b>blue</b> through the photopolymerization by 254 nm UV irradiation. On {{the basis of the}} selective illumination through a DNA photomask, we precisely manufacture specific patterns using a microarray spotting method and also demonstrate the capability of this strategy to achieve a novel colorimetric DNA sensor without any complicated process. clos...|$|E

40|$|In many haplochromine cichlid fish, male nuptial {{coloration}} {{is subject}} to female mate choice and plays {{a central role in}} the evolution of reproductive isolation between incipient species. Intraspecific variation in male coloration may serve as a target for diversifying sexual selection and provide a starting point for species divergence. Here, we investigated a polychromatism in Neochromis omnicaeruleus, a haplochromine from Lake Victoria, East-Africa. In this species, male coloration ranges from skyblue to yellow-red and females are grey-blue to yellow. We found that both genetic and environmental factors influence the expression of these colours during individual development. In a natural population, we found that male colour was associated with size and sexual maturity: yellow males were smaller than blue males and tended to be sexually immature. In females, size and maturity did not differ between colour types. Laboratory crosses revealed that there is a heritable component to the observed colour variation: yellow parents produced more yellow offspring than blue parents. Together with repeated aquarium observations of yellow individuals that gradually become blue, these data suggest that yellow males <b>change</b> <b>to</b> <b>blue</b> as they approach sexual maturity, and that the occurrence and timing of this transition is influenced by both environmental and genetic effects. The significance of this mechanism of colour expression as a possible target for divergent selection remains to be evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Sudden {{infant death}} {{syndrome}} (SIDS) is the term used to designate the almost inexplicable deaths of seemingly healthy infants. Also known as, crib death, SIDS is the leading category of infant deaths {{between the ages of}} two weeks and one year and account for one-third of all deaths after the newborn period. It is agreed in the medical community that SIDS occurs in healthy infants because of the simultaneous occurrence of a series of seemingly unrelated biological events. Infants who have periods of apnea, or difficulty in breathing, sudden skin color <b>change</b> <b>to</b> <b>blue</b> or pale, changes in muscle tone either to limpness or rigidity and who appear to require help in breathing {{are more likely to be}} effect by SIDS. We have developed a wireless autonomous infant/baby mobility detection, monitoring, analysis and alarm event generation system. The system is capable of detecting, monitoring and profiling/correlating infant/baby mobility such as breathing, rollovers, falls, shaking (mild/violent), and tremors. Specific mobility events will require critical event processing such as an infant rolling over and as result could now be suffocating and may become a sudden {{infant death syndrome}} (SIDS) event. The system will wirelessly relay these critical series of events to a series of monitor/alarm mesh network node facilities for immediate caretaker notification. This system wirelessly relays these critical events to series of collector facilities that is in their default configuration, are attached directly to a medical managed service provider or care giver to support a large nursery or hospital pediatric unit.

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{was carried out}} on a total of 883 cold chain monitor (CCM) cards, which had been attached to batches of poliomyelitis, measles, DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus) and hepatitis B vaccines, during their transport and storage from the central store in Kuala Lumpur to Kelantan, a state in north-eastern Malaysia; 234 freeze watches attached to hepatitis B vaccines were also analysed. The monitor cards and freeze watches were observed at six levels between the central store and the periphery during distribution of the vaccines, and a colour change {{in any of the}} four windows (A, B, C, D) on the CCM cards or the freeze watches was recorded. In addition, 33 unopened vials of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), collected from refrigerators in 29 health facilities in Kelantan, were tested for potency using the tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID 50) method; 14 of them (42 %) did not meet the WHO criteria for potent vaccines. The results showed that at the final destination 13. 4 % of all cards remained white while a colour <b>change</b> <b>to</b> <b>blue</b> was observed in 65 % in window A, 16. 6 % in window B, and 4. 4 % in window C; none had turned blue in window D indicating that the vaccine had not been subjected to temperatures > or = 34 degrees C for 2 hours. All but 2 of the 234 freeze watches had turned purple, which indicates exposure of the hepatitis B vaccines to temperatures below 0 degree C. These results will assist health planners to correct the weaknesses identified in the cold chain system...|$|E
