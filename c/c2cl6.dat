The liquefying of gases helped to establish that gases are the vapours of liquids possessing a very low boiling point and gave a more solid basis to the concept of molecular aggregation. In 1820 Faraday reported the first synthesis of compounds made from carbon and chlorine, <b>C2Cl6</b> and C2Cl4, and published his results the following year. Faraday also determined the composition of the chlorine clathrate hydrate, which had been discovered by Humphry Davy in 1810. Faraday is also responsible for discovering the laws of electrolysis, and for popularizing terminology such as anode, cathode, electrode, and ion, terms proposed in large part by William Whewell.|$|E

40|$|Treatment of N,N'-bis(aryl) {{formamidines}} (ArFormH), N,N'-bis(2, 6 -difluorophenyl) formamidine (DFFormH) or N,N'-bis(2, 6 -diisopropylphenyl) formamidine (DippFormH), with europium {{metal in}} CH₃CN is an efficient {{synthesis of the}} divalent complexes: [{Eu(DFForm) ₂(CH₃CN) ₂}₂] (Eu 1) or [Eu(DippForm) ₂(CH₃CN) ₄] (Eu 2). The synthetic method was extended to ytterbium, but the metal required activation by addition of Hg⁰. With DFFormH in CH₃CN, [{Yb(DFForm) ₂(CH₃CN) }₂] (Yb 1) was obtained in good yield, and [Yb(DFForm) ₂(thf) ₃] (Yb 3) was obtained from a synthesis in CH₃CN/THF. Thus, this synthetic method completely circumvents the use of either salt metathesis, or redox transmetallation/protolysis (RTP) protocols to prepare divalent rare-earth formamidinates. Heating Yb 1 in PhMe/C₆D₆ resulted in decomposition to trivalent products, including one from a CH₃CN activation process. For a synthetic comparison, divalent ytterbium DFForm and DippForm complexes were synthesised by RTP reactions between Yb⁰, Hg(R) ₂ (R=Ph, C₆F₅), and ArFormH in THF, leading to the isolation of either [Yb(DFForm) ₂(thf) ₃] (Yb 3), or the first five coordinate rare-earth formamidinate complex [Yb(DippForm) ₂(thf) ] (Yb 4 [*]b), and, from adjustment of the stoichiometry, trivalent [Yb(DFForm) ₃(thf) ] (Yb 6). Oxidation of Yb 3 with benzophenone (bp), or halogenating agents (TiCl₄(thf) ₂, Ph₃CCl, <b>C₂Cl₆)</b> gave [Yb(DFForm) ₃(bp) ] or [Yb(DFForm) ₂Cl(thf) ₂], respectively. Furthermore, the structural chemistry of divalent ArForm complexes has been substantially broadened. Not only have the highest and lowest coordination numbers for divalent rare-earth ArForm complexes been achieved in Eu 2 and Yb 4 [*]b, respectively, but also dimeric Eu 1 and Yb 1 have highly unusual ArForm bridging coordination modes, either perpendicular μ- 1 κ(N:N') : 2 κ(N:N') in Eu 1, or the twisted μ- 1 κ(N:N') : 2 κ(N':F') DFForm coordination in Yb 1, both unprecedented in divalent rare-earth ArForm chemistry and in the wider divalent rare-earth amidinate field...|$|E
