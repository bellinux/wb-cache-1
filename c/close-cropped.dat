5|$|Caracalla's {{official}} portrayal as sole emperor marks a {{break from}} the detached images of the philosopher-emperors who preceded him: his <b>close-cropped</b> haircut is that of a soldier, his pugnacious scowl a realistic and threatening presence. This rugged soldier-emperor, an iconic archetype, was adopted by most of the following emperors, such as Maximinus Thrax, who were dependent on the support of the troops to rule the empire.|$|E

25|$|A <b>close-cropped</b> or {{completely}} shaven haircut {{is common in}} military organizations. In field environments, soldiers are susceptible to infestation of lice, ticks, and fleas. In addition short hair is also more difficult for an enemy to grab hold of in hand-to-hand combat, and short hair makes fitting gas masks and helmets easier.|$|E
25|$|Tomlin {{was one of}} {{the first}} female comedians to break out in male drag with her {{characters}} Tommy Velour and Rick. In 1982, she premiered Pervis Hawkins, a black rhythm-and-blues soul singer (patterned after Luther Vandross), with a mustache, beard, and <b>close-cropped</b> afro hairstyle, dressed in a three-piece suit. Tomlin used very little, if any, skin-darkening cosmetics as part of the character, instead depending on stage lighting to create the effect.|$|E
25|$|Sam is born on 15 April 1980, {{making her}} 16 {{years old when}} she first meets the Eighth Doctor in 1997. She attends Coal Hill School, the same school the First Doctor's granddaughter Susan {{attended}} in 1963. She is described as being thin and wiry, with blue eyes and <b>close-cropped</b> blonde hair. She is a clean-living person, not drinking or taking drugs, and a vegetarian. She is also a supporter of Greenpeace and gay rights. In The Eight Doctors the Doctor rescues her from drug dealers, after which she travels with him for many adventures. The novel Seeing I is deliberately ambiguous as to the possibility that Sam is bisexual.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{earliest}} depictions clearly intended to directly represent Jesus himself are many showing {{him as a}} baby, usually held by his mother, especially in the Adoration of the Magi, seen as the first theophany, or display of the incarnate Christ to the world at large. The oldest known portrait of Jesus, found in Syria and dated to about 235, shows him as a beardless young man of authoritative and dignified bearing. He is depicted dressed {{in the style of}} a young philosopher, with <b>close-cropped</b> hair and wearing a tunic and pallium – signs of good breeding in Greco-Roman society. From this, it is evident that some early Christians paid no heed to the historical context of Jesus being a Jew and visualised him solely in terms of their own social context, as a quasi-heroic figure, without supernatural attributes such as a halo (a fourth-century innovation).|$|E
500|$|As an {{artificial}} construct, Cortana has no physical form or being. Cortana always {{speaks with a}} smooth female voice, and she can communicate through comm systems and project a holographic image of herself from appropriate projectors, such as Holotanks, and appears holographically as a woman. Cortana is said to resemble her creator, Dr. Catherine Halsey, with a similar attitude [...] "only unchecked by military and social protocol". In Halo: The Fall of Reach, Cortana is described as slender, with <b>close-cropped</b> hair and a skin hue that varies from navy blue to lavender, depending on [...] her mood. Numbers and symbols flash across her form when she is thinking. In Halo 4 Cortana has become more human in appearance with more subtle additions being added to her character model such as a gap being visible between her front teeth. Cortana was played by actress Mackenzie Mason using advanced facial rendering technology to capture movements in her face while speaking to add a more human look.|$|E
500|$|George Boldt (1851–1916), the {{founding}} proprietor, was a Prussian-born American hotelier and self-made millionaire who influenced {{the development of}} the urban hotel as a civic social center and luxury destination. His motto was [...] "the guest is always right", and he became a wealthy and prominent figure internationally. The hotel was built to his specifications. He served as president and director of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel Company, as well as the Waldorf–Astoria Segar Company and the Waldorf Importation Company. He also owned and operated the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, an elite boutique hotel on Broad Street in Philadelphia, with his wife, Louise. Boldt was described as [...] "Mild mannered, undignified, unassuming", resembling [...] "a typical German professor with his <b>close-cropped</b> beard which he kept fastidiously trimmed... and his pince-nez glasses on a black silk cord". Boldt retained his contacts with the European elite and he and his wife made frequent trips to Europe, bringing back with them many antiques, a characteristic of the Waldorf Astoria. Boldt continued to own the Bellevue even after his relationship with the Astors blossomed.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} hotel {{started as}} two hotels on Fifth Avenue built by feuding relatives. The first hotel, the 13-story, 450-room Waldorf Hotel, designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh in the German Renaissance style, was opened on March 13, 1893 {{at the corner}} of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street, on the site where millionaire developer William Waldorf Astor had his mansion. The original hotel stood [...] high, with a frontage of about [...] on Fifth Avenue, with an area of [...] The original hotel was described as having a [...] "lofty stone and brick exterior", which was [...] "animated by an effusion of balconies, alcoves, arcades, and loggias beneath a tile roof bedecked with gables and turrets". William Astor, motivated in part by a dispute with his aunt Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor, had built the Waldorf Hotel next door to her house, on the site of his father's mansion. The hotel was built to the specifications of founding proprietor George Boldt, who owned and operated the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, a fashionable hotel on Broad Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with his wife Louise. Boldt was described as [...] "Mild mannered, undignified, unassuming", resembling [...] "a typical German professor with his <b>close-cropped</b> beard which he kept fastidiously trimmed... and his pince-nez glasses on a black silk cord". Boldt continued to own the Bellevue even after his relationship with the Astors blossomed.|$|E

2500|$|The Afro {{saw some}} [...] {{resurgence}} {{in both the}} 1990s and the 2000s. These Afros would take varied forms—some incorporating elements such as braids, beads or twists—as well as various sizes—from <b>close-cropped</b> natural hairstyles {{all the way to}} expansive Afro wigs.|$|E
2500|$|Descriptions and {{portraits of}} Leonardo combine {{to create an}} image {{of a man who was}} tall, {{athletic}} and extremely handsome. He was at least [...] tall, the length of his skeleton. Portraits indicate that as an older man, he wore his hair long, at a time when most men wore it cropped short, or reaching to the shoulders. [...] While most men were shaven or wore <b>close-cropped</b> beards, Leonardo's beard flowed over his chest.|$|E
2500|$|Other styles {{include the}} [...] "natural" [...] (also {{known as a}} [...] "mini-fro" [...] or [...] "teenie weenie Afro") and [...] "microcoils" [...] for <b>close-cropped</b> hair, the twist-out and braid-out (in which hair is trained in twists or braids before being unravelled), [...] "Brotherlocks" [...] and [...] "Sisterlocks,". Also, the fade, twists (Havana, Senegalese, crochet), faux locs, braids (Ghana, box, crochet, cornrows), bantu knots, custom wigs and weaves or any {{combination}} of styles such as cornrows and Afro-puffs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of the heads were made of a fine, white limestone, while {{a couple of examples}} have been found that were made of ground mud from the banks of the Nile. Although there are a few exceptions that are more crudely carved and heavily plastered, most are intricately carved and have been carefully smoothed. The smooth ones have not, however, been polished. They all depict people with shaved heads or <b>close-cropped</b> hair, and the largest examples are just over [...] in height.|$|E
2500|$|Often {{called a}} [...] "fighter pilot's fighter pilot" [...] and ranked with other better-known American {{military}} aviation greats such as Gregory [...] "Pappy" [...] Boyington and Chuck Yeager, Voris {{was a big}} man with <b>close-cropped</b> hair, known for his even-temperedness and coolness in the cockpit. Owing to his superb piloting skills, he survived numerous accidents and emergency situations. Voris was nearly killed by a Japanese Zero that attacked his aircraft during the defense of Guadalcanal in what he later described as his first [...] "real" [...] dog fight (which earned him a Purple Heart).|$|E
2500|$|Some {{readers have}} {{wondered}} if the bodies shown in cutaway may have been Jewish inmates at concentration camps, since they appear gaunt and have shaved heads or <b>close-cropped</b> haircuts. Israel asked the Simon Wiesenthal Center if {{this might have been}} the case. Wiesenthal himself answered that it was unlikely, since during the Third Reich the Vienna Landsgericht, or district court, passed death sentences solely on [...] "non-Jewish Austrian patriots, communists and other enemies of the Nazis." [...] Further, it has long been standard practice to shave the heads of cadavers prior to dissection.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Taylor {{had been}} at Drumcree that July and got a {{close-up}} view of Wright. Taylor described Wright as a [...] "charismatic leader". Clad in neat jeans, white T-shirt and wearing a single gold earring, he displayed a muscular build. Flanked by two bodyguards, Wright's sudden appearance at Drumcree had inspired much admiration from the young boys and girls who were present. Journalist David McKittrick in the Belfast Telegraph described Wright as having been heavily tattoed, who walked with a [...] "characteristic strut that radiated restrained menace"; and had a [...] "bullet head, <b>close-cropped</b> with small ears and deep-set, piercing eyes". Martin Dillon, who had interviewed him in his home in Portadown, {{admitted that he had}} been pleasant and charming throughout the interview, yet throughout the encounter Dillon had [...] "sensed a dark side to his character". Wright was also considered to have been a [...] "political thinker and capable strategist".|$|E
60|$|Honora took a {{good look}} at the famous Trixy, who resembled a certain type of {{military}} Englishman. He had <b>close-cropped</b> hair and a <b>close-cropped</b> mustache; and his grey eyes, as they rested amusedly on Mrs. Chandos, seemed to have in them the light of mockery.|$|E
60|$|The {{door swung}} open with the same {{promptness}} as before. A villainous-faced man with <b>close-cropped</b> hair stood in the doorway.|$|E

60|$|At this action, {{so unlike}} her husband, Mrs. Pendyce blushed like a girl. Her eyes above his grey and <b>close-cropped</b> head seemed {{grateful}} {{that he did}} not reproach her, glad of that caress.|$|E
60|$|But in {{his brief}} absence {{he seemed to}} have {{completely}} groomed himself, and stood there, the impersonation of <b>close-cropped,</b> clean, and wholesome English young manhood. The two women appreciated it with cat-like fastidiousness.|$|E
60|$|My <b>close-cropped</b> {{black hair}} and thern {{complexion}} were the subjects of much comment. When Xodar told his fellow nobles of my fighting ability and strange origin they crowded about me with numerous questions.|$|E
60|$|At the summons a huge, <b>close-cropped</b> {{head was}} thrust {{out of the}} galley, and a man of {{beautiful}} muscular development stepped out before {{the eyes of the}} paralyzed skipper, and began to remove his coat.|$|E
60|$|A {{moment later}} the adversaries were face to face--Rotherby, {{divested}} of his wig and with a kerchief bound about his <b>close-cropped</b> head, all a trembling eagerness; Mr. Caryll with a reluctance lightly masked by a dangerous composure.|$|E
60|$|Captain Armand Jacot flushed to {{the roots}} of his <b>close-cropped</b> hair. Then he went very white and took a {{half-step}} toward the Arab. His fists were clenched. Suddenly he thought better of whatever impulse was moving him.|$|E
60|$|Massy, very still, {{and turning}} an {{attentive}} ear, had fastened his eyes upon the silvery, <b>close-cropped</b> {{back of the}} steady old head. The ship herself seemed to be arrested but for the gradual decrease of depth under her keel.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold!" [...] cried Thurid, and {{springing}} forward before I {{could guess}} his intention, he had grasped my beard and ripped the whole false fabric {{from my face}} and head, revealing my smooth, tanned skin beneath and my <b>close-cropped</b> black hair.|$|E
60|$|Paul {{was almost}} grown up, too. He was sixteen, his {{chestnut}} curls had given place to <b>close-cropped</b> brown locks, {{and he was}} more interested in football than fairies. But the bond between him and his old teacher still held. Kindred spirits alone do not change with changing years.|$|E
60|$|Louise welcomed her visitor eagerly with outstretched hands, which Bellamy {{raised for}} a moment to his lips. Then she turned toward the third person, who had also risen {{at the opening of the}} door--a short, {{somewhat}} thick-set man, with swarthy complexion, <b>close-cropped</b> black hair, and upturned black moustache.|$|E
60|$|I {{lay upon}} a <b>close-cropped</b> sward of red grasslike vegetation, and about me {{stretched}} {{a grove of}} strange and beautiful trees, covered with huge and gorgeous blossoms and filled with brilliant, voiceless birds. I call them birds since they were winged, but mortal eye ne'er rested on such odd, unearthly shapes.|$|E
