The {{objectives of the}} research were to identify cause of low-quality rubber, identify farmer’s efforts to increase rubber quality, to describe and to test relationship between  socioeconomic characteristics of the farmers, technical factors, and rubber quality among them, and to analyze farmer benefit after use of rubber quality technology. Data for the research were generated from 64 respondents randomly from three villages. Descriptive statistics, qualitative analysis, binary logistic regression model, and partial budgets analysis were used in analysing the data. The result of analysis showed that farmers in program village produced lower grade rubber (average 6. 13) than farmers in non-program village (average 6. 98). The identification result suggest that the causes of low-quality rubber were the use of coagulant other than formic acid, use of additive coagulant and existence of contaminants in coagulump. The empirical result revealed that majority of farmers did efforts to increase rubber quality such as cleaning of <b>collecting</b> <b>pans</b> periodic, keeping of coagulump from contaminants, but just minority of farmer used trained tappers, cleaning of collecting cups before tapping, dissociating types of coagulump {{and there were no}} farmers using of formic acid as coagulant.

This ecosystem service is nowadays threatened, because bees suffer from agricultural intensification. Yet, bees rarely benefit from the measures established to promote biodiversity in farmland, such as agri-environment schemes (AES). We experimentally tested if the spatio-temporal modification of mowing regimes within extensively managed hay meadows, a widespread AES, can promote bees. We applied a randomized block design, replicated 12 times across the Swiss lowlands, that consisted of three different mowing treatments: 1) first cut not before 15 June (conventional regime for meadows within Swiss AES); 2) first cut not before 15 June, as treatment 1 but with 15 % of area left uncut serving as a refuge; 3) first cut not before 15 July.

Little is known about the mechanisms through which urbanization impacts wild bee communities, or the types of urban green spaces that best promote their conservation in cities. The main objective of this study was to describe and compare wild bee community diversity, structure, and dynamics in two Canadian cities, Montreal and Quebec City. A second objective was to compare functional trait diversity among three habitat types (cemeteries, community gardens and urban parks) within each city. Bees were <b>collected</b> using <b>pan</b> traps and netting on the same 46 sites, multiple times, over the active season in 2012 and 2013. A total of 32, 237 specimens were identified, representing 200 species and 6 families, including two new continental records, Hylaeus communis Nylander (1852) and Anthidium florentinum (Fabricius, 1775). Despite high community evenness, we found significant abundance of diverse species, including exotic ones. Spatio-temporal analysis showed higher stability in the most urbanized city (Montreal) but low nestedness of species assemblages among the three urban habitats in both cities. Our study demonstrates that cities are home to diverse communities of wild bees, but in turn affect bee community structure and dynamics. We also found that community gardens harbour high levels of functional trait diversity. Urban agriculture therefore contributes substantially to the provision of functionally diverse bee communities and possibly to urban pollination services.

Low frequency (0. 46 kHz) susceptibility (χLF) and saturation isothermal remanent magnetisation (SIRM) measurements were used to determine the magnetic properties of the bulk samples and the grain size fractions. Samples were also subjected to magnetic extraction, to concentrate the iron oxide minerals, and thence determine their degree of association with the radionuclides of interest. The efficiency of the magnetic extraction technique was estimated from rock magnetic measurements, before and after the extraction procedure. The placer deposits, enriched in iron oxide grains by environmental sorting processes, were both finer grained and more magnetic than the bulk sand. The mean particle diameter of the bulk sand was largely (∼ 75 %) greater than 200 μm, whereas for the placer material, > 88 % of particles have mean diameters of 70 % of the magnetic signal was associated with these extracts. Concentrations of all three radionuclides in the magnetic extracts were enhanced relative to the weakly magnetic residue. The proportions of 210 Po(210 Pb), 239 + 240 Pu and 241 Am associated with the magnetic extracts were ∼ 18 %, ∼ 12 % and ∼ 11 %, respectively. Therefore, although the strongly magnetic iron oxide fraction contains measurably enhanced levels of these radionuclides, the majority of the α-radioactivity appears {{to be associated with the}} weakly magnetic residue...|$|R

The abundance of the adult stage of the predators and parasitoids of the inter/border/hedgerow crops {{was found to be}} higher. The results of the study confirmed the role of crop diversification as a tool to enhance the functional biodiversity of parasitoids and predators for an efficient biological control program.|$|R
40|$|The pre-sidedress soil nitrate test (PSNT) is {{recommended}} {{in many states}} as a best management practice (BMP) for corn (Zea mays L.). A 2 -yr {{study was conducted in}} Connecticut on a Woodbridge fine sandy loam soil (coarse loamy, mixed, mesic Aquic Dystrochrept) to determine NO 3 -N concentrations and losses in soil water from corn managed with three different N fertilization regimes: (i) PRE, 196 kg N ha− 1 applied preplant; (ii) PSNT- 1, 90 kg N ha− 1 applied at preplant and any remaining N needs estimated by the PSNT (0 kg ha− 1 in 1995 and 45 kg ha− 1 in 1996); and (iii) PSNT- 2, no preplant N and all N needs estimated by the PSNT (34 kg ha− 1 in 1995 and 123 kg ha− 1 in 1996). Percolate was <b>collected</b> with zero-tension <b>pan</b> lysimeters. Flow-weighted NO 3 -N concentrations from the PRE treatment were 22. 3 mg L− 1 in 1995 and 17. 4 mg L− 1 in 1996; the PSNT treatments were 3 ̆c 8. 0 mg L− 1. Losses of NO 3 -N as a percent of N applied in 1995 were 20...|$|R

In 1995, wick lysimeters were also installed at 1. 2 m depth in the same access pits. Treatments have included N fertilizer rates, use of manure, crop rotation (continuous corn, corn-soybean, alfalfa-corn), and tillage (chisel plow-disk, no-till). The leachate data were used to evaluate a number of nitrate leaching models. Some of the highlights of the 11 years of results include the following: 1) growing corn without organic N inputs at the economic optimum N rate (EON) resulted in NO 3 –-N concentrations of 15 to 20 mg l- 1 in leachate; 2) use of manure or previous alfalfa crop as partial source of N also resulted in 15 to 20 mg l- 1 of NO 3 –-N in leachate below corn at EON; 3) NO 3 –-N concentration in leachate below alfalfa was approximately 4 mg l- 1; 4) NO 3 –-N concentration in leachate below soybeans following corn was influenced by fertilizer N rate applied to corn; 5) the mass of NO 3 –-N leached below corn at the EON rate averaged 90 kg N ha- 1 (approx. 40 % of fertilizer N applied at EON); 6) wick lysimeters collected approximately 100 % of leachate vs. 40 – 50 % <b>collected</b> by <b>pan</b> lysimeters. Coefficients of variation of the collected leachate volumes for both lysimeter types were similar; 7) tillage did not markedly affect nitrate leaching losses; 8) tested leaching models could accurately predict leachate volumes and could be calibrated to match nitrate leaching losses in calibration years, but only one model (SOILN) accurately predicted nitrate leaching losses in the majority of validation treatment years. Apparent problems with tested models: there was difficulty estimating sizes of organic N pools and their transformation rates, and the models either did not include a macropore flow component or did not handle macropore flow well...|$|R
