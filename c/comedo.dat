5|$|Sebaceous glands are {{involved}} in skin problems such as acne and keratosis pilaris. In the skin pores, sebum and keratin can create a hyperkeratotic plug called a <b>comedo.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} pathologic {{change is}} {{the formation of a}} plug (a microcomedone), which is driven primarily by excessive growth, reproduction, and accumulation of skin cells in the hair follicle. In normal skin, the skin cells that have died come up to the surface and exit the pore of the hair follicle. However, increased production of oily sebum in those with acne causes the dead skin cells to stick together. The accumulation of dead skin cell debris and oily sebum blocks the pore of the hair follicle, thus forming the microcomedone. This is further exacerbated by the biofilm created by P. acnes within the hair follicle. If the microcomedone is superficial within the hair follicle, the skin pigment melanin is exposed to air, resulting in its oxidation and dark appearance (known as a blackhead or open <b>comedo).</b> In contrast, if the microcomedone occurs deep within the hair follicle, this causes the formation of a whitehead (known as a closed <b>comedo).</b>|$|E
5|$|Acne vulgaris is {{a chronic}} skin {{disease of the}} pilosebaceous unit and {{develops}} due to blockages in the skin's hair follicles. These blockages are thought to occur {{as a result of}} the following four abnormal processes: a higher than normal amount of oily sebum production (influenced by androgens), excessive deposition of the protein keratin leading to <b>comedo</b> formation, colonization of the follicle by Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) bacteria, and the local release of pro-inflammatory chemicals in the skin.|$|E
40|$|Acne surgery {{consists}} of <b>comedone</b> extraction of non-inflamed lesions, triamcinolone acetate injections of some inflamed lesions, and extraction of milia. Prevention {{is a very}} important part of <b>comedone</b> treatment, especially avoidance of picking, moisturizers and harsh soaps. Instruments are also very important: even the finest may be too thick and may have to be filed down. Acne surgery is only an adjunct of good medical therapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{factors that}} {{initiate}} the inflammatory response in acne are not known. The presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines in acne comedones was therefore investigated. One hundred eight open comedones {{were collected from}} 18 untreated acne patients (10 male, 8 female). Each <b>comedone</b> was homogenized and centrifuged, and the supernatant was analyzed for bioactive and immunochemically detectable IL- 1 Î±, IL- 1 β, and TNFÎ±. Viable counts of propionibacteria, staphylococci, and Malassezia spp. were determined in the <b>comedone</b> pellet. Bioactive IL- 1 Î±-like material was demonstrated in 76 % of open comedones (range of 23 - 4765 pg IL- 1 Î±-like bioactvity/mg of <b>comedone</b> material). In 58 % of comedones, levels exceeded 100 pg/mg. There was no correlation between IL- 1 Î±-like bioactivity and IL- 1 Î± determined immunochemically. Bioactive IL- 1 β was not detected in any comedones. Twenty-four percent contained low levels of immunochemical IL- 1 β (range 12 - 103 pg IL- 1 β/mg <b>comedone</b> material). Bioactive TNFÎ± was detected in three comedones with a further five comedones containing immunochemical TNFÎ± (range of 61 - 820 pg TNFÎ±/mg <b>comedone</b> material). The majority of open comedones (97 %) contained microorganisms. There was, however, no significant correlation (Spearman's rank) between levels of any cytokine, in particular IL- 1 Î±-like bioactivity, and numbers of microorganisms. Thus, bioactive IL- 1 Î±-like material {{in the majority of}} open comedones may be concerned in the initiation of inflammation in acne following spongiosis or rupture of the pilosebaceous follicle wall...|$|R

5|$|Decreased {{levels of}} retinoic acid {{in the skin}} may {{contribute}} to <b>comedo</b> formation. To address this deficiency, methods to increase the skin's production of retinoid acid are being explored. A vaccine against inflammatory acne has shown promising results in mice and humans. Some have voiced concerns about creating a vaccine designed to neutralize a stable community of normal skin bacteria that is known to protect the skin from colonization by more harmful microorganisms.|$|E
5|$|Recommended therapies for {{first-line}} use in acne vulgaris treatment include topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, and topical or oral antibiotics. Procedures such {{as light}} therapy and laser therapy {{are not considered}} to be first-line treatments and typically have an adjunctive role due to their high cost and limited evidence of efficacy. Medications for acne work by targeting the early stages of <b>comedo</b> formation and are generally ineffective for visible skin lesions; improvement in the appearance of acne is typically expected between six and eight weeks after starting therapy.|$|E
5|$|The main {{hormonal}} {{driver of}} oily sebum {{production in the}} skin is dihydrotestosterone. Another androgenic hormone responsible for increased sebaceous gland activity is DHEA-S. Higher amounts of DHEA-S are secreted during adrenarche (a stage of puberty), and this leads {{to an increase in}} sebum production. In a sebum-rich skin environment, the naturally occurring and largely commensal skin bacterium P. acnes readily grows and can cause inflammation within and around the follicle due to activation of the innate immune system. P. acnes triggers skin inflammation in acne by increasing the production of several pro-inflammatory chemical signals (such as IL-1α, IL-8, TNF-α, and LTB4); IL-1α is known to be essential to <b>comedo</b> formation.|$|E

In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of this ointment on the formation of comedones induced by application of 50 % oleic acid on the orifices of the external auditory canals of rabbits. Methods: The application sites were observed with a dermatoscope, and {{the area of the}} hair pores was measured using an Image analysis software program. Results: The chlorhexidine gluconate ointment inhibited <b>comedone</b> formation significantly more effectively than the liquid paraffin used as a control (P &lt; 0. 001). We also investigated the therapeutic effect of this ointment on comedones. After starting application of chlorhexidine gluconate ointment or liquid paraffin on the <b>comedone</b> area, the hair pore size was gradually decreased in the group treated with chlorhexidine gluconate ointment compared with the hair pore size at baseline. Conclusion: These results suggest that chlorhexidine gluconate ointment is effective for inhibiting <b>comedone</b> formation as well as for treating already formed comedones. Chlorhexidine gluconate ointment is a useful topical medicine for the treatment of early-stage acne and for preventing acne.

5|$|Acne is a {{very common}} problem, {{particularly}} during puberty in teenagers, and is thought to relate to an increased production of sebum due to hormonal factors. The increased production of sebum {{can lead to a}} blockage of the sebaceous gland duct. This can cause a <b>comedo,</b> (commonly called a blackhead or a whitehead), which can lead to infection, particularly by the bacteria Propionibacterium acnes. This can inflame the comedones, which then change into the characteristic acne lesions. Comedones generally occur on the areas with more sebaceous glands, particularly the face, shoulders, upper chest and back. Comedones may be 'black' or 'white' depending on whether the entire pilosebaceous unit, or just the sebaceous duct, is blocked. Sebaceous filaments—innocuous build-ups of sebum—are often mistaken for whiteheads.|$|E
500|$|<b>Comedo</b> {{extraction}} {{is supported}} by limited evidence but is recommended for comedones that do not improve with standard treatment. Another procedure for immediate relief is injection of a corticosteroid into an inflamed acne <b>comedo.</b> [...] Electrocautery and electrofulguration have also been reported as effective treatments for comedones.|$|E
500|$|A major {{mechanism}} of acne-related skin inflammation is mediated by P. acnes ability to bind and activate {{a class of}} immune system receptors known as toll-like receptors (TLRs), especially TLR2 and TLR4. Activation of TLR2 and TLR4 by P. acnes leads to increased secretion of [...] IL-1α, IL-8, and TNF-α. Release of these inflammatory signals attracts various immune cells to the hair follicle including neutrophils, macrophages, and Th1 cells. IL-1α stimulates increased skin cell activity and reproduction, which in turn fuels <b>comedo</b> development. Furthermore, sebaceous gland cells produce more antimicrobial peptides, such as HBD1 and HBD2, in response to binding of TLR2 and TLR4.|$|E

We recently observed a healthy 64 -year-old Iranian man, who presented with numerous asymptomatic multilobular oval-to-round well-defined 0. 5 to 1. 5 cm cystic lesions with central umbilication (central black eschar) over the upper {{portion of his}} chest. We made the diagnosis of epidermoid cyst, giant <b>comedone</b> and leech bite {{on the basis of}} the constellation of clinical features. The patient was treated with oral ciprofloxacin at a dose of 2 g daily, and 2 % topical erythromycin solution. Despite improvement, the evidence of cystic lesions persisted. There was no history of similar lesions in any other family member. There was no history of trauma. The patient was not using any topical or systemic medication. Two weeks before his visit, he had a history of leech therapy under the supervision of a general practitioner. His medical history was significant for leech therapy of the lesions, five days previously. He was followed up for another two weeks and after disappearance of the inflammation, with the patient under local anesthesia, the well-circumscribed mass was completely evacuated with a sharp curette and <b>comedone</b> extractor. The patient was subsequently lost to follow-up. Conclusion: Considering the efficacy of leeches, it would be favorable to breed a germ-free leech. In Iran, the use of the leeches in surgery, in recent years, has been infrequent.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Adequate {{control of}} acne is difficult, {{regardless}} of the various conventional modalities. Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) system {{is one of the}} emerging options that are become increasingly useful. METHODS: To achieve the best IPL parameters we evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of IPL at 752 -nm wavelength, 35 j/cm 2 fluence, 55 -ms pulse duration in comparison with 572 -nm wavelength, 35 j/cm 2 fluence, 101 -ms pulse duration, in a 5 week, controlled, double-blind, split-face clinical trial. Final assessment was made by comparison of the changes in inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions count and the Acne Global Severity Scale (AGSS) between two groups, based on standardized photography. RESULT: Fifteen female patients, with mean age of 23. 53 ± 2. 47 years (range 20 - 28) completed the 5 -week therapy period. For both therapies, significant reductions (approximately 30 %) in the <b>comedone</b> and inflammatory lesions count were observed (p= 0. 0024). There {{was no significant difference in}} the efficacy of the two treatments in reducing the percentage of <b>comedone</b> and inflammatory lesions count from baseline to 5 th week (p= 0. 76 and p= 0. 61, respectively). Based on acne global severity scale (AGSS), no significant difference in the severity of acne lesions of the two treatments was observed at 5 th-week visit (p= 0. 26). CONCLUSION: Considering the lack of significant difference between the two treatments and since greater risks are associated with lower pulse duration, the use of longer pulse durations is recommended, especially in darker skin phenotype. Further studies with larger number of patients are required to fully comparison of efficacy of these parameters in IPL systems for acne vulgaris. </p...|$|R
500|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} {{affects the}} skin and {{increases the risk of}} tumors in the kidneys and lungs. The condition is characterized by multiple noncancerous dome-shaped tumors of the hair follicles (fibrofolliculomas), particularly on the face, neck, and—more rarely—the upper chest. The fibrofolliculomas are generally described as having an opaque white color or a yellowish tone and have a waxy, smooth texture. The tumors are always found on and around the nose and on and behind the outer ear. Typically, they first appear in a person's 20s or 30s, and are found in more than 80% of people with the syndrome above the age of 40. [...] The tumors become larger and more numerous over time. Tumors differ between individuals: they may appear merged in plaques, look similar to a <b>comedo</b> with a plug of keratin, or include epidermoid cysts. A large number of tumors on the face can be associated with hyperseborrhea (abnormally elevated sebum production). The presence of fibrofolliculomas on a person's face can cause significant psychological distress.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>comedo</b> is a clogged hair {{follicle}} (pore) in the skin. Keratin (skin debris) combines with oil {{to block the}} follicle. A <b>comedo</b> can be open (blackhead) or closed by skin (whitehead), and occur with or without acne. The word <b>comedo</b> comes from the Latin comedere, meaning [...] "to eat up", and was historically used to describe parasitic worms; in modern medical terminology, {{it is used to}} suggest the worm-like appearance of the expressed material.|$|E

5|$|A UK Kennel Club survey {{puts the}} median {{lifespan}} of Miniature Schnauzers {{at a little}} over 12 years. About 20% lived to >15 years. While generally a healthy breed, Miniature Schnauzers may suffer health problems associated with high fat levels. Such problems include hyperlipidemia, which may increase the possibility of pancreatitis, though either may form independently. Other issues which may affect this breed are diabetes, bladder stones and eye problems. Feeding the dog low- or non-fatty and unsweetened foods may help avoid these problems. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to <b>comedone</b> syndrome, a condition that produces pus filled bumps, usually on their backs, {{which can be treated}} with a variety of methods. Miniature Schnauzers should have their ears dried after swimming due to a risk of infection, especially those with uncropped ears; ear examinations {{should be part of the}} regular annual check up.

OBJETIVOS: Avaliar a eficácia e a tolerabilidade do adapaleno 0, 1 % gel no tratamento da acne vulgar leve à moderada, em pacientes residentes no Brasil. MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS: Os pacientes aplicaram o gel à noite, durante 12 semanas, e foram avaliados quanto à efetividade pelo número de lesões em cada visita e quanto à tolerabilidade ao produto nas consultas da segunda e da décima segunda semana. RESULTADOS: Dos 125 pacientes, 81, 6 % completaram as 12 semanas de tratamento, e 10, 4 % dos casos terminaram o estudo antes do período estabelecido por estarem livres de lesões. Os resultados permitem confirmar a marcante atividade antiinflamatória, antiproliferativa e na diferenciação celular dos ceratinócitos. Houve diminuição dos <b>comedões</b> e das lesões inflamatórias, com resposta satisfatória no eritema, no ressecamento e na descamação da pele. Efeitos adversos pouco graves foram relatados em apenas 9, 6 % dos pacientes. CONCLUSÕES: O adapaleno, neste estudo e nos vários que o antecederam, vem-se mostrando uma das melhores opções de tratamento tópico para os casos leves a moderados de acne vulgar. BACKGROUND: Adapalene, a naftoic acid {{derivative}} with biological properties {{similar to}} those of the retinoic acid, is indicated in the treatment of acne vulgaris. OBJECTIVES: The present study was carried out to evaluate the therapeutic action of adapalene 0. 1 % gel and its tolerability in the treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris in patients living in Brazil. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients applied the gel at night for 12 weeks; and were evaluated regarding the efficacy and tolerability of the product according to the number of lesions observed at each of the 2 -week and 12 -week visits. RESULTS: Out of 125 patients, 81. 6 % completed 12 weeks of therapy and 10. 4 % of the cases left the study before week 12 because they were found to be lesion-free. Results allow us to confirm its effect upon keratinocyte cellular differentiation with antiinflammatory and antiproliferative properties. Adapalene induces a marked decrease in <b>comedos</b> and inflammatory lesions. Mild adverse events were reported in less than 10 % of patients.

40|$|Acne is {{a common}} {{inflammatory}} skin disease which affects the pilosebaceous units of the skin. It can have severe psychological effects and can leave the patient with severe skin scarring. There are four well-recognized pathological factors responsible for acne {{which is also the}} target for acne therapy. In this review, different treatment options are discussed, including topical (i. e., retinoids, and antibiotics) and systemic (i. e., retinoids, antibiotics, and hormonal) treatments. Since the general public has been showing an increasing interest in more natural and generally safer treatment options, the use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) for treating acne was also discussed. The use of physical therapies such as <b>comedone</b> extraction, cryoslush therapy, cryotherapy, electrocauterization, intralesional corticosteroids and optical treatments are also mentioned. Acne has been extensively researched with regards to the disease mechanism as well as treatment options. However, due to the increasing resistance of Propionibacterium acnes towards the available antibiotics, {{there is a need for}} new treatment methods. Additionally, the lack of necessary evidence on the efficacy of CAM therapies makes it necessary for researchers to investigate these treatment options further...|$|R

40|$|Acne {{surgery is}} the use of various {{surgical}} procedures for the treatment of postacne scarring and also, as adjuvant treatment for active acne. Surgery is indicated both in active acne and post-acne scars. Physicians&#x 2032; qualifications: Any Dermatologist can perform most acne surgery techniques as these are usually taught during postgraduation. However, certain techniques such as dermabrasion, laser resurfacing, scar revisions need specific "hands-on" training in appropriate training centers. Facility: Most acne surgery procedures can be performed in a physician&#x 2032;s minor procedure room. However, full-face dermabrasion and laser resurfacing need an operation theatre in a hospital setting. Active acne: Surgical treatment is only an adjunct to medical therapy, which remains the mainstay of treatment. <b>Comedone</b> extraction is a process of applying simple mechanical pressure with a <b>comedone</b> extractor, to extract the contents of the blocked pilosebaceous follicle. Superficial chemical peel is a process of applying a chemical agent to the skin, so as to cause controlled destruction of the epidermis leading to exfoliation. Glycolic acid, salicylic acid and trichloroacetic acid are commonly used peeling agents for the treatment of active acne and superficial acne scars. Cryotherapy: Cryoslush and cryopeel are used for the treatment of nodulocystic acne. Intralesional corticosteroids are indicated for the treatment of nodules, cysts and keloidal acne scars. Nonablative lasers and light therapy using Blue light, non ablative radiofrequency, Nd:YAG laser, IPL (Intense Pulsed Light), PDT (Photodynamic Therapy), pulse dye laser and light and heat energy machines have been used in recent years for the treatment of active inflammatory acne and superficial acne scars. Proper counseling is very important in the treatment of acne scars. Treatment depends on the type of acne scars; a patient may need more than one type of treatment. Subcision is a treatment to break the fibrotic strands that tether the scar to the underlying subcutaneous tissue, and is useful for rolling scars. Punch excision techniques such as punch excision, elevation and replacement are useful for depressed scars such as ice pick and boxcar scars. TCA chemical reconstruction of skin scars (CROSS) (Level C) is useful for ice pick scars. Resurfacing techniques include ablative methods (such as dermabrasion and laser resurfacing), and nonablative methods such as microdermabrasion and nonablative lasers. Ablative methods cause significant postoperative changes in the skin, are associated with significant healing time and should be performed by dermatosurgeons trained and experienced in the procedure. Fillers are useful for depressed scars. Proper case selection is very important in ensuring satisfactory results...|$|R
40|$|Nevus comedonicus {{is a type}} of hamartoma {{that arises}} from a {{developmental}} anomaly of the mesodermal part of the pilosebaceous gland. In most cases of nevus comedonicus, an acne-like skin condition develops. Repeated inflammation can cause a morphological change to the cyst, papule, to abscess. We experienced a case of congenital nevus comedonicus, which {{led to the formation of}} large multiple cysts. A 50 -year-old man was referred with a 12. 5 × 10 cm lobulated mass on the posterior neck and upper back. The patient had a widespread presence of nevus comedonicus in the region ranging from the right superior chest to the posterior neck. The patient had a 30 -year history of six prior excisions. A magnetic resonance imaging review led to a diagnosis of nevus comedonicus. Surgical treatment consisted of excision of the mass and wide excision for the patch type of nevus comedonicus around the neck. On histopathology, multiple masses were diagnosed as typical cysts containing keratinized tissue. The diffuse <b>comedone</b> lesions were diagnosed as nevus comedonicus. This case shows that large, multiple cysts can occur as a long-term complication of nevus comedonicus, and also highlights the importance of radical resection to prevent its further invagination...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris is {{a common}} disease of the pilosebaceous unit, {{clinically}} showing alteration of the keratinization process leading to <b>comedos</b> formation and subsequent inflammatory process. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the morphology of acne lesions and pilosebaceous units by means of in vivo reflectance confocal microscopy, in order to non-invasively define the microscopic alterations occurring during the acne process. METHODS: A set of standardized clinical pictures {{and a set of}} reflectance confocal images were acquired from 25 volunteers, presenting mild-to-moderate acne, and 10 healthy volunteers, using Vivascope 3000 ®, and 10 mosaics on apparently normal skin were acquired by 5 acne patients and 5 healthy volunteers by Vivascope 1500 ®, and evaluated by experts. RESULTS: Confocal microscopy enabled to identify morphological aspects characterizing different types of acne lesions. Apparently normal skin of acne patients, compared with healthy skin of patients with no history of acne, revealed peculiar confocal features, such as bright rings around hair follicle that may represent the early events in acne lesion formation. CONCLUSION: The fast and reliable characterization of acne lesions and identification of subclinical alterations in acne-prone skin through confocal examination, corresponding to infundibular hyper-keratinization, may have important clinical consequences in the assessment of acne severity, therapeutic decisions and treatment efficacy monitoring...|$|R
