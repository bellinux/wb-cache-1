5|$|During World War I the Bialystok-Grodno District was the {{administrative}} division of German-controlled territory of Ober-Ost. It comprised the city, as the <b>capital,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> surrounding Podlaskie region, roughly {{corresponding to the}} territory of the earlier Belostok Oblast. At the end of World War I the city became part of the newly independent Second Polish Republic, as the capital of the Białystok Voivodeship (1919–1939). During the 1919–1920 Polish-Soviet War, possession of the city by the Red Army and the Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee occurred during the lead up to the Battle of Warsaw. During the resultant counteroffensive, the city returned to Polish control after the Battle of Białystok.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages, the Anuradhapura Kingdom {{did not have}} a strong regular army except for a small body of soldiers. These were {{assigned}} for guarding the <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> royal palace. The King had the right to demand an able bodied son for military service from every family in his kingdom. In times of war, a larger army was formed using this method. An army consisted of four main divisions; an elephant corps, cavalry, chariots and infantry. This combination was called Chaturangani Sena (fourfold army). However, the majority of the army was infantry composed of swordsmen, spearmen and archers.|$|E

5|$|Following the Metropolitan Police Act 1829 and the City of London Police Act 1839, {{the capital}} was policed by two forces, the Metropolitan Police, who held sway {{over most of}} the <b>capital,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> City of London Police, who were {{responsible}} for law enforcement within the historic City boundaries. The events in Houndsditch in December 1910 fell into the purview of the City of London service, and the subsequent actions at Sidney Street in January 1911 were in the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan force. Both services came under the political control of the Home Secretary, who in 1911 was the 36-year-old rising politician Winston Churchill.|$|E

5|$|The {{success and}} {{expansion}} of Islam brought it into contact with different cultures, societies and traditions, {{such as those of}} Byzantines and Persians. With such contact, new problems emerged for Islamic law to tackle. Moreover, there was a significant distance between Medina, the Islamic <b>capital,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Muslims on the periphery on the Islamic state. Thus far off jurists had to find novel Islamic solutions without the close supervision of the hub of Islamic law (back in Medina). During the Umayyad dynasty, the concept of qiyas was abused by the rulers. The Abbasids, who succeeded the Umayyads defined it more strictly, in an attempt to apply it more consistently.|$|E

The United Rhodesia Party merged with the Federal Party to become the United Federal Party (UFP) in November 1957, and the liberal Todd was voted out of office by the more right-wing members of his party four months later, in February 1958. He was replaced by Sir Edgar Whitehead. Todd led {{his own version of}} the United Rhodesia Party against the UFP and the Dominion Party in June the same year, but failed to win a single seat—the UFP won 17 of the 30 seats, with the Dominion Party taking the remainder.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the advance units of the Leningrad Front arrived at Tallinn early on 22 September, German troops had {{practically}} abandoned {{the city and the}} streets were empty. The last German unit to leave Tallinn that morning was the 531st Navy Artillery Battalion. Before embarkation, all stationary artillery and armaments, special equipment, guns that could not be evacuated, ammunition, the telephone exchange, the radio broadcast house, locomotives and railroad cars, and the railway were destroyed. The Tallinn power plant was fired upon from the sea and the Old City Harbour was destroyed. The retreating German units had no combat contact with the Red Army in Tallinn. The Government of Estonia had failed to concentrate the Estonian soldiers retreating from the Narva and Emajõgi fronts, as the units were scattered and mixed with the German detachments withdrawing towards Latvia. Therefore, the government lacked significant military forces to repulse the Soviet forces concentrated around Tallinn. The units securing the national <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> government were led by Rear Admiral Johan Pitka. Troops of the Leningrad Front seized Tallinn on 22 September. Jüri Uluots, acting President of Estonia, evacuated to Sweden. In the following days, several pro-independence Estonian battle groups attacked the Soviet troops in Harju and Lääne counties without success.|$|E

5|$|During the Renaissance, architects {{aimed to}} use columns, pilasters, and entablatures as an {{integrated}} system. The Roman orders types of columns are used: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. These {{can either be}} structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall {{in the form of}} pilasters. One of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the Old Sacristy (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi. Arches, semi-circular or (in the Mannerist style) segmental, are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> springing of the arch. Alberti {{was one of the first}} to use the arch on a monumental. Renaissance vaults do not have ribs; they are semi-circular or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the Gothic vault, which is frequently rectangular.|$|E
5|$|Fresh {{from his}} {{crushing}} victory over Liu Wuzhou, in August 620 Li Shimin, with {{an army of}} 50,000 men, began his advance from Shanxi towards Luoyang. His progress was swift: by September Tang troops had begun to establish a ring of fortified camps around the city, while detachments had penetrated further south, east and north, triggering the defection of most of central Henan from Wang's control. The monks of the nearby Shaolin Monastery also sided with Li Shimin, defeating a detachment of Wang's army at Mount Huanyuan and capturing his nephew, Wang Renze. Wang Shichong was now isolated in his <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> territory immediately around it. The Tang were able to defeat his repeated attempts {{to break through the}} siege, and the supply situation in Luoyang grew steadily worse as the siege continued into winter and then spring. By March, people were reportedly shifting through dirt to find traces of food, or ate cakes of rice and mud.|$|E
5|$|His death {{marked the}} {{effective}} {{end of the}} Bulgarian Empire. Ivan Vladislav's sons were young and inexperienced, and even the strongest Bulgarian leaders doubted the advisability of further resistance. Upon learning {{of the death of}} the Tsar, Basil II left Constantinople. In Adrianople he was met by the brother of Krakra who acknowledged Byzantine authority. His example was followed by the larger part of the Bulgarian nobility who pledged loyalty to Basil II, giving up their fortresses. In Serres, Krakra along with the commanders of 35 castles met the emperor and surrendered, and in Strumitsa he received a message sent by the Empress-dowager Maria to negotiate the surrender of the <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> country. Basil II richly awarded those who surrendered, allowing them to keep their lands, wealth and titles. Short-lived resistance continued under Ivan Vladislav's eldest son Presian II and his brothers, but they also surrendered by the end of 1018.|$|E
