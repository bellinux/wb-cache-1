The cell shape has significant influence on the <b>crushing</b> <b>strength</b> of honeycombs in both x directional impact and y directional impact at low impact velocities, in which the <b>crushing</b> <b>strength</b> can be diminished to only 10 % of that of the regular honeycomb.

40|$|In {{designing}} a package for transporting hazardous or radioactive materials, {{there are a}} number of components whose design can lead to the success or failure to meet regulatory requirements for Type B packages. One of these components is the impact limiter. The primary purpose of the impact limiter is to protect the package and its contents from sudden deceleration. It can also act as a thermal barrier. The package is protected by the impact limiter`s ability to act as an energy absorber. The <b>crush</b> <b>strength</b> of most impact limiting materials is determined by a standard quasistatic (QS) method. However it has been observed that {{there are a number}} of factors that affect <b>crush</b> <b>strength.</b> The material being used as an impact limiter may appear incompressible because of one or more of these factors. Factors that determine compressive strength of impact limiter materials are; the material density; the thickness of the impact limiter material. There must be adequate material to absorb the impact and not go into lockup, lockup up occurs when the free volume of the material is eliminated and the <b>crush</b> <b>strength</b> sharply increases; the angle of impact; and the loading rate and operating temperature. All of these are interactive and therefore difficult to model. It is the intent of tests discussed in this paper to determine the dependency of <b>crush</b> <b>strength</b> to loading rate and angle of impact to the basic grain direction of two different densities of four impact limiting materials...|$|E

The maximum coefficient of variation for both <b>crushing</b> <b>strength</b> and tension strength are with specimens in TR 45 ° direction.

40|$|The dynamic {{crushing}} {{behaviors in}} the x-and the y-directions of hexagonal honeycombs with various cell-wall angles are explored by both experiments and numerical simulations. Several deformation modes are identified based on {{the shape of the}} localization band forming by the cells' collapse. The respective influence of the cell-wall angle, the crushing velocity and the honeycomb's relative density on the honeycomb's mechanical properties is studied. It is shown that these influencing factors affect the honeycomb's x-directional <b>crushing</b> <b>strength</b> by altering the deformation mode of the honeycomb, while both the y-directional <b>crushing</b> <b>strength</b> and the average <b>crushing</b> <b>strength</b> are dominated by the honeycomb's density. With retaining the honeycombs' relative density as a constant, the honeycomb with the cell-wall angle of about 45 degrees exhibits the optimal <b>crushing</b> <b>strength</b> and energy absorption capacity under the y-directional crushing, while the average <b>crushing</b> <b>strength</b> in the x-and the y-directions decreases with the cell-wall angle. Significant orthotropic anisotropy is revealed in the honeycombs with the cell-wall angle greater than 30 degrees, especially under low-velocity compression.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} developing a predictive method {{for determining the}} dynamic densification behavior of thermite powder mixtures consisting of equivolumetric mixtures of Ta + Fe₂O₃ and Ta + Bi₂O₃. Of primary importance to these highly reactive powder mixtures {{is the ability to}} characterize the stress at which full compaction occurs, the <b>crush</b> <b>strength,</b> which can significantly influence the stress required to initiate reaction during dynamic or impact loading. Examined specifically are the quasi-static and dynamic compaction responses of these mixtures. Experimentally obtained compaction responses in the quasi-static regime are analyzed using available compaction models, and an analysis technique is developed that allows for a correct measurement of the apparent yield strength of the powder mixtures. The correctly determined apparent yield strength is combined with an equation of state to yield a prediction of the shock densification response, including the dynamic <b>crush</b> <b>strength</b> of the thermite powder mixtures. The validated approach is also extended to the Al + Fe₂O₃ thermite system. It is found that accurate predictions of the <b>crush</b> <b>strength</b> can be obtained through determination of the apparent yield strength of the powder mixture when incorporated into the equation of state. It is observed that the predictive ability in the incomplete compaction region is configurationally dependent for highly heterogeneous thermite powder systems, which is in turn influenced by particle morphology and differences in intrinsic properties of constituents (density, strength, etc.).

40|$|AbstractThe {{authors have}} been {{studying}} the mechanical properties of granulated coal ash formed by the milling process {{with a small amount}} of cement added, with particles almost equivalent in size to sand or fine gravel. The use of granulated coal ash has many advantages, such as the suppression of leaching of heavy metals and the possibility of outdoor curing. In addition, since granulated coal ash is produced artificially, their particle strength can be understood easily. Another advantage is that it is possible to control the particle strength, something which cannot be performed in natural sands. The present research was carried out in order to investigate the possibility of putting such advantages to good use. Single particle crushing tests were carried out on various kinds of granulated coal ash to evaluate the crushing characteristics of each individual grain. Also, the characteristics of the individual particle, such as shape, were investigated. Next, one-dimensional compression tests were conducted to investigate their compression characteristics. Finally, drained monotonic triaxial compression tests were performed under different confining pressures. The effects of the confining pressure on the shear characteristics, as well as their relation to shear strength, were examined with the single particle <b>crushing</b> <b>strength</b> taken into account. Contrary to observations in natural sands, the single particle <b>crushing</b> <b>strength</b> of granulated coal ash did not depend on particle size. Regarding compression characteristics, granulated coal ash compressed very easily because the <b>crushing</b> <b>strength</b> of a single particle was low. Therefore, the yield stress of granulated coal ash was found to be smaller than that of natural sands. Moreover, the <b>crushing</b> <b>strength</b> affected the shear characteristics, i. e., as the <b>crushing</b> <b>strength</b> increased, the shear stiffness became higher and the compressive volumetric strain became smaller. Therefore, <b>crushing</b> <b>strength</b> can be a useful parameter in evaluating the shear characteristic of granulated coal ash...|$|R
