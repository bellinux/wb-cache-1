50|$|Pindone, diphacinone, and <b>coumatetralyl</b> are the first-generation {{anticoagulants}} {{most commonly}} used for pest control.

40|$|The major {{findings}} {{of the study were}} as follows:; 1. Rats ate significantly more <b>coumatetralyl</b> than brodifacoum, and rats in an area of physiological resistance (central southern England) ate greater quantities of rodenticide than rats in the east midlands. <b>Coumatetralyl</b> failed to achieve rat control on farms in central southern England.; 2. Physiological resistance was suspected on two farms in the east midlands (near Lincoln) where rats ate excessive quantities of <b>coumatetralyl</b> and the control programme was unexpectedly extended.; 3. GCMS analyses performed on extracts of 169 whole rodents revealed that some rats had eaten levels of <b>coumatetralyl</b> that far exceeded a lethal dose for susceptible animals. Excessive bait consumption occurred mostly in the area of physiological resistance, but also on the two sites in the east midlands where resistance was suspected. Brodifacoum consumption by some rats was also high, but complete control was usually achieved with brodifacoum and {{there was no evidence of}} any resistance to brodifacoum.; 4. HPLC analyses carried out on 10 rats from <b>coumatetralyl</b> sites (five from each region), revealed that trapped, physiologically-resistant animals are capable of carrying 50 times the LD 50 of <b>coumatetralyl</b> without any obvious ill effect. Rats from the east midlands carried a significantly lower load of coumatetralyl.; 5. Video observations gave no evidence to support a bait point monopoly theory. Interactions at feeding sites were common.; 6. This study has revealed that the potential exposure of non-target predators and scavengers to rodenticides is considerably higher in areas where rats show physiological resistance. This fact is discussed with reference to the regulation and monitoring of pesticides in the UK...|$|E
40|$|The {{baseline}} susceptibility of {{the lesser}} bandicoot rat, Bandicota bengalensis, from Rangoon, Burma, to five anticoagulant rodenticides was established with no-choice feeding in the laboratory. The susceptibility of lesser bandicoots to the several poisons (brodifacoum, difenacoum, diphacinone, <b>coumatetralyl,</b> and warfarin) {{was such that}} they were offered at a 0. 001 % concentration. B. bengalensis was most susceptible to brodifacoum, and in descending order, difenacoum, <b>coumatetralyl,</b> diphacinone and warfarin. In comparison with Rattus norvegicus on warfarin at 0. 005 %, B. bengalensis proved more susceptible. Feeding tests at 0. 005 % concentration indicated that a 1 -day feeding on brodifacoum and difenacoum would result in complete mortality, whereas <b>coumatetralyl</b> and warfarin would require 4 days feeding to a 100 % kill. Brodifacoum and difenacoum are recommended at 0. 002 - 0. 005 % bait concentrations and <b>coumatetralyl</b> at 0. 005 [...] 0. 01 % concentrations for the control of B. bengalensis {{in the field in}} Rangoon.

40|$|International audienceThe first aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the pharmacokinetics of eight anticoagulant rodenticides (brodifacoum, bromadiolone, chlorophacinone, <b>coumatetralyl,</b> difenacoum, difethialone, flocoumafen and warfarin) in plasma and liver of the mouse after single oral administration. Eight groups of mice dosed orally with a different anticoagulant rodenticide in a dose equal to one-half the lethal dose 50 (LD(50)), were killed at various times up to 21 days after administration. The eight anticoagulant rodenticides were assayed in plasma and liver by an LC-ESI-MS/MS method. Depending on the compound, the limit of quantification was set at 1 or 5 ng/mL in plasma. In liver, the limit of quantification was set at 250 ng/g for <b>coumatetralyl</b> and warfarin and at 100 ng/g for the other compounds. The elimination half-lives in plasma for first-generation rodenticides were shorter than those for second-generation rodenticides. <b>Coumatetralyl,</b> a first-generation product, had a plasma elimination half-life of 0. 52 days. Brodifacoum, a second-generation product, showed a plasma elimination half-life of 91. 7 days.

40|$|<b>Coumatetralyl</b> (Racumin) {{has been}} known since 1957 as a {{multiple}} dose anticoagulant and has been used successfully over many decades. In the seventies and especially the eighties, rats developed an increased resistance to anticoagulants in certain regions of Central Europe. Also, the addition of vitamin K to animal feed (especially to chicken feed) has reduced the efficacy against rats and mice in farm buildings. Combinations of anticoagulants with different types of vitamin D are generally described to increase the efficacy of action against rodents. It was found that especially the combination of <b>coumatetralyl</b> with cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3) could overcome the above mentioned problems. Cholecalciferol causes hypercalcemia and, therefore, has a different mode of action compared to anticoagulants. The combination of these active ingredients leads to an obvious increase in efficacy against rodents, even under difficult conditions.

40|$|A {{new blood}} {{clotting}} response {{test was used}} to determine the susceptibility, to <b>coumatetralyl</b> and bromadiolone, of laboratory strains of Norway rat from Germany and the UK (Hampshire), and wild rats trapped on farms in Wales (UK) and Westphalia (Germany). Resistance factors were calculated in relation to the CD strain of Norway rat. An outbred strain of wild rats, raised from rats trapped in Germany, was found to be more susceptible to <b>coumatetralyl</b> by a factor of 0. 5 - 0. 6 compared to the CD strain. Homozygous and heterozygous animals of a strain of resistant rats from Westphalia were cross-resistant to <b>coumatetralyl</b> and bromadiolone, with a higher resistance factor for bromadiolone than that found in both UK strains. Our results show that the degree of altered susceptibility and resistance varies between strains of wild rat and between resistance foci.

40|$|Rodent {{control is}} an {{important}} issue in human health and agriculture. Oil palm plantations are rapidly expanding in Indonesia and this is having a major economic and ecological impact. Rodent control in oil palm plantations is based principally on the use of anti-vitamin K (AVK), the main anticoagulant used being <b>coumatetralyl,</b> a first-generation AVK. We conducted a comparative study in two well established oil palm plantations in Indonesia: (1) one without chemical control in Riau and (2) another with intensive <b>coumatetralyl</b> use on Bangka Island. Rat species were identified by the molecular barcoding method. Susceptibility to <b>coumatetralyl</b> was then assessed within the two populations and we screened for mutations in vkorc 1, which encodes the molecular target of AVK. Different species were found in the two areas: Rattus tiomanicus in Riau, and a mix of R. tanezumi and a close relative one in Bangka. The rats in Riau were much more susceptible to <b>coumatetralyl</b> than those in Bangka. This study is the first to demonstrate physiological tolerance to AVK in these species. vkorc 1 displayed low levels of polymorphism, and no SNP was associated with the hightolerance phenotypes of R. tanezumi clade, even those exposed to very high concentrations (32 9 the effective dose of 0. 36 mg kg- 1). The biochemical basis of this tolerance remains unknown, but may involve the vkorc 1 promoter and/or cytochrome P 450 metabolism. We discuss our results and the selective role of anticoagulant use in the occurrence of phenotypic tolerance. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|<b>Coumatetralyl</b> and chlorophacinone, two {{substances}} {{related to}} 4 -hydroxycoumarin (HC) and to 1, 3 -indandione (ID), respectively, show activity as anticoagulant rodenticides. In {{the present study}} we have investigated the solid-state structures of <b>coumatetralyl</b> and chlorophacinone by means of X-ray single-crystal and powder diffraction, along with thermal analysis. The crystal structures of the two compounds {{have been used as}} input geometries for a series of computational chemistry efforts, involving other anticoagulant derivatives as well. Thus, ab initio, semiempirical molecular orbital, molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics/simulated annealing calculations have been performed on thirteen anticoagulant rodenticides. In particular, the annealing calculations have been made to assess the conformational freedom of the compounds under scrutiny. All the generated conformers have been classified into families. The classification has first been made empirically, and then validated by means of a cluster analysis. A number of structural and physico-chemical parameters derived from the calculations has been used in turn for structure-activity relationships (SARs) investigations. In the latter, we have assessed how the selected parameters affect toxicity. The results seem to be consistent with a three-dimensional biophore model, in which higher toxicity is predicted for the more voluminous rodenticides. We suggest that these compounds better fit the active site of the target enzyme vitamin K 2, 3 -epoxide reductase (KO-reductase). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

A resetting toxin delivery device (Spitfire) is being developed as part of a programme entitled 'Pest Control for the 21 st Century', funded by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. The Spitfire works by firing a paste containing a toxin on to the belly of stoats and rats as they pass through a tunnel. The device then resets. When the stoats and rats groom the paste from their fur, they ingest the toxin. Each Spitfire is capable of approximately 100 doses and is fitted with a counter and a delay mechanism. The first successful field trial of the stoat Spitfire was undertaken in the Blue Mountains, West Otago in late 2013. Stoat abundance was significantly reduced but technical problems meant the trigger mechanism had to be re-designed.

40|$|Anticoagulant {{resistance}} was first discovered in UK Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus Berk.) in 1958 {{and has been}} present ever since. The possible detrimental impact of resistance on effective rodent control was quickly recognised and, for almost three decades, extensive research {{was conducted on the}} geographical distribution and severity of anticoagulant resistance in UK rats. Various schemes for the eradication of resistant rats were also implemented. At first, surveys showed resistance only to the first-generation anticoagulants, such as warfarin, chlorophacinone and <b>coumatetralyl,</b> but later resistance to the more potent second-generation anticoagulants, such as difenacoum and bromadiolone, was also discovered. Unlike some European countries, where only one or two resistance mutations occur, virtually all known rat resistance mutations occur in the UK and five are known to have significant impacts on anticoagulant efficacy. Little is currently known of the geographical extent of anticoagulant resistance among Norway rats in the UK because no comprehensive survey has been conducted recently. At an operational level, anticoagulants generally retain their utility for Norway rat control but {{it is virtually impossible to}} control resistant rats in some areas because of restrictions on the use of the more potent resistance-breaking compounds.

40|$|AbstractOnce rats have invaded farm buildings, {{efficient}} rat control {{usually requires}} {{the application of}} rodenti-cides. Efficacy of control measures may be lost by physiological resistance to anticoagulant rodenticides and by behavioural reactions of the target rat population. On a farm within the area of anticoagulant resistance in north-west Germany, two consecutive rodenticide treatments were carried out against rats, using different anticoagulant bait preparations. Bait consumption was monitored in combination with direct individual video-monitoring of bait uptake behaviour. Almost half of the rats survived the first three-week treatment using <b>coumatetralyl</b> bait. This result was ascribed to the high overall degree of anticoagulant resistance prevailing in the rat population. The second treatment of the same population using difenacoum bait totally failed to reduce population numbers. Dietary preferences, neophobia, social interactions and habitat structure are important behavioural parameters determining bait uptake. They are discussed {{in relation to the}} results of the treatment and a conceptual model for the factors determining rodent control efficacy is presented. The combined results of the two monitoring techniques applied demonstrate the significance of resistance and bait uptake behaviour for the efficacy of rat control measures and suggest the need for adapted rat-control strategies to reduce hygienic problems and the risk of non-target poisoning hazards for livestock and wildlife. This can be achieved if the choices of bait base and active ingredient as well as the methods of bait positioning are adapted to the behavioural peculiarities of the rats and the specific structural conditions on each farm...|$|E

Rats were trapped at a single infested site in each of 12 1 km x 1 km squares in a line including a resistance hot spot. Tissue samples were taken from all trapped rats, and genotyped for the Y 139 C variant of the vkorc 1 gene. The frequency of the resistance gene was determined for each site sampled. Data were also collected about rodent control measures applied in the past and other relevant local conditions. The frequency of the resistance gene varied considerably between 80 %. There was no obvious correlation of the frequency of the resistance gene and the distance to the hot spot, and there was no increase or decrease of the gene frequency in west-east direction. Permanent baiting and poor rodent control practice seemed to increase the incidence of resistance in the respective site. The implementation of good rodent control practice is recommended to prevent an increase in the frequency of resistance. The study was funded by the Rodenticide Resistance Action Committee (RRAC) of CropLife International...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAnticoagulant rodenticides (ARs) {{are highly}} toxic {{compounds}} that are exclusively {{used for the}} control of rodent pests. Despite their defined use, they are nonetheless found in {{a large number of}} non-target species indicating widespread penetration of wildlife. Attempts to quantify the scale of problem are complicated by non-random sampling of individuals tested for AR contamination. The American mink (Neovison vison) is a wide ranging, non-native, generalist predator that is subject to wide scale control efforts in the UK. Exposure to eight ARs was determined in 99 mink trapped in NE Scotland, most of which were of known age. A high percentage (79 %) of the animals had detectable residues of at least one AR, and more than 50 % of the positive animals had two or more ARs. The most frequently detected compound was bromadiolone (75 % of all animals tested), followed by difenacoum (53 % of all mink), <b>coumatetralyl</b> (22 %) and brodifacoum (9 %). The probability of mink exposure to ARs increased by 4. 5 % per month of life, and was 1. 7 times higher for mink caught in areas with a high, as opposed to a low, density of farms. The number of AR compounds acquired also increased with age and with farm density. No evidence was found for sexual differences in the concentration and number of ARs. The wide niche and dietary overlap of mink with several native carnivore species, and the fact that American mink are culled for conservation throughout Europe, suggest that this species may act as a sentinel species, and the application of these data to other native carnivores is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Zoonotic {{cutaneous}} leishmaniasis {{is a growing}} health problem in many rural areas of Iran. Rhombomys opimus, the great gerbil, is the main animal reservoir of ZCL {{in the northeast and}} central part of Iran. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the rodenticidal effect of Coumavec® (a mixture of <b>Coumatetralyl</b> 0. 5 % and Etofenprox 0. 5 %) on R. opimus under laboratory condition. Great gerbils were collected from Sejzi rural district, Esfahan Province, Iran. Four groups of 19 great gerbils were treated with the poisoned baits of different concentrations and one group was considered as control. The bating procedure was conducted in three stages: first, second (a week after first) and third (a month after first stage), in each stage baits were offered in 1 day, based on national protocol for rodent control operation in purpose of ZCL control. The mortality rate for 0. 03, 0. 0625, 0. 125 and 0. 25 % concentrations in the first stage of baiting were obtained 36. 8 %, 31. 5 %, 52. 6 % and 36. 8 %, in the second stage 47. 3 %, 52. 6 %, 68. 4 % and 52. 6 %, and in the third stage 52. 6 %, 63. 1 %, 68. 4 % and 57. 8 % respectively. The maximum and minimum mortality has occurred in 5 - 6 days and 31 - 40 days intervals consequently. The results of this study showed that, Coumavec® has some rodenticidal effects on R. opimus in laboratory condition. For the appropriate rodenticide-insecticide contamination of the rodent body and also considering to the economic issues, we suggest the use of 0. 125 % concentration for rodent control operation in the field condition...|$|E
40|$|Rodent {{control is}} carried out {{extensively}} in New Zealand to protect the native fauna and flora. This review outlines {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of different rodenticides as alternatives to sodium fluoroacetate (1080), and their suitability for aerial application. It includes existing rodenticides and those in the registration ‘pipeline’, as well as those that are not currently available in New Zealand. In the short to medium term, the focus for aerial baits should be on those compounds already registered in New Zealand or other countries. Aerial brodifacoum baiting is appropriate in isolated situations, but is not suitable for repeated use on the mainland, as brodifacoum is highly persistent and will bioaccumulate. Diphacinone has been registered for field use in New Zealand and the US Environmental Protection Agency has recently registered it for aerial control of rodents for conservation purposes; therefore, this is a logical first choice for control in New Zealand. Cholecalciferol is the next best option, as there is no secondary poisoning and thus there would be lower risk to non-target bird species; this is currently registered for field use as a rodenticide in bait stations. The third option is cholecalciferol in combination with <b>coumatetralyl,</b> which should be more effective than cholecalciferol alone, and the fourth is zinc phosphide. In the longer term, the preferred alternative to 1080 would be a novel, humane red blood cell toxin, related to para-aminopropiophenone (PAPP). PAPP is an attractive new pesticide that is being developed for stoat (Mustela erminea) and feral cat (Felis catus) control; however, the rodenticidal potential of this class of compounds still remains to be determined. Availability and registration status could influence this priority list in the future. A strategy to manage mice (Mus musculus) and sustain rat (Rattus spp.) control needs to be flexible and integrate non-anticoagulant and anticoagulant use...|$|E
