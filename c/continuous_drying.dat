40|$|Soil-water {{retention}} curves (SWRCs) can {{be determined}} using high-suction tensiometers (HSTs) following two different procedures that involve either continuous or discrete measurement of suction. In the former case, suction measurements are taken while the sample is permanently exposed to the atmosphere and the soil is continuously drying. In the latter case, the drying or wetting process is halted at different stages to ensure equalization within the sample before measuring suction. <b>Continuous</b> <b>drying</b> {{has the advantage of}} being faster; however, it has the disadvantage that the accuracy of mass measurements (necessary for the determination of water content) is affected by the weight and stiffness of the cable connecting the HST to the logger. To overcome this problem, an alternative <b>continuous</b> <b>drying</b> procedure is presented in this paper in which two separate but nominally identical samples are used to obtain a single SWRC; one sample is used for the mass measurements, while a second sample is used for suction measurements. It is demonstrated that the new <b>continuous</b> <b>drying</b> procedure gives SWRCs that are similar to those obtained by discrete drying. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|An {{alternative}} {{technique for}} {{the determination of}} the soil water retention curve has recently been proposed whereby a tensiometer is used to measure soil suction and a balance to record the water content variations. The soil water retention curve is obtained by drying the soil either continuously or by stages (i. e. each drying stage is followed by an equalization period). Initial results from tests on compacted soil suggest that the relatively fast evaporation rate during <b>continuous</b> <b>drying</b> affects the water retention curve whereas the stage drying procedure provides more accurate results. Factors such as sample geometry and tensiometer position (relative to the sample) are also likely to affect the response obtained during <b>continuous</b> <b>drying.</b> These are the object of future investigation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{manner of}} {{recirculating}} rice dryers which is extensively used in Taiwanis intermittent drying. Intermittent drying {{is composed of}} heating and tampering. A drying cycle includes heating time and tempering time. In a drying cycle, the drying time is used to be fixed and the tempering time changes and signifcantly affects the drying rate and milling quality of rice. this study focus on the effectof tempering time on drying rate and milling quality of rice for recirculating drying. the testing items of quality includethe percentage of brown rice, polished rice, head yield and germination rate. According to the experimental results, the following conclusions are drawnas below: If the tempering time is not included, the heating time is fixed and the tempering time in a cycle increase, the total heating time become longer. It points out extending the tempering time for drying cycle can increase the average drying rate for only the heating period. On the contrary, if the tempering time is counted, the drying rate will decrease {{with the increase of}} the tempering time. When the drying air temperature is above 50 ℃,the percentage of polished rice for intermittent drying is higher than <b>continuous</b> <b>drying.</b> Tempering process benefits the production of polish rice. The drying air temperture influences more on the head yield than the time ratio of heating and tempering. When the drying air temperature is over 50 ℃, head yield drops obviously for both intermittent drying and <b>continuous</b> <b>drying.</b> The percentage of head yield of intermittent drying is always higher than <b>continuous</b> <b>drying.</b> the percentage of head yield decrease with the decrease of the tempering time. When tempering time is less then 70 minites, the percentage of head yield declines significantly. Therefore, in order to prevent the loss of the percentage of head yield, the tempering time in a drying cycle should not be less then 1 / 7. Drying air temperature influence the percentage of germination more then tempering. When the drying air temperature is above 60 ℃, the percentage of germination drops apparently. The percentage of germination for intermittent drying is higher than <b>continuous</b> <b>drying.</b> 國內常用之循環式乾燥機,其乾燥方式為間歇乾燥,而間歇乾燥包括乾燥 時間與均化時間,在乾燥時乾燥時間常為固定,均化時間的長短對稻榖乾燥 速率與品質有相當重要的影響。本研究乃針對在間歇乾燥作業,進行均化 時間對稻榖乾燥速率與品質影響之研究。量測品質項目包括糙米率、白米 率、完整米率與發芽率。乾燥試驗結果如下列所示﹕(1) 就不包括均化時 間而言,當固定熱風乾燥時間,增加每循環期之均化時間,則每循環乾 燥時間變長,亦即增加每循環乾燥時間,可以提高實際的乾燥速率;就包含 均化時間而 言,乾燥速率隨著均化時間的增長而降低。(2) 在本試驗 條件範圍內,當乾燥溫度超過 50 ℃時,白米率有明顯隨溫度下降的趨勢,間 歇 式乾燥之白米率大於連續式乾燥,故均化作用有助白米率的提升 。(3) 在本試驗條件範圍內,乾燥溫度對完整米率的影響較乾燥/均化時間 為大;當乾燥溫度 超過 50 ℃以上,無論間歇式乾燥或連續式乾燥,完整 米率皆有明顯的下降。(4) 間歇式乾燥之完整米率大於連續式乾燥,並且 隨著均化時間的減少而降低,當乾燥/均 化時間小於 10 / 70 時完整米率 有明顯的下降,每循環乾燥期間乾燥時間與均化時間的比 應大於 1 : 7 。(5) 乾燥溫度對發芽率的影響較乾燥/均化時間為大,當乾燥溫度大於 60 ℃時,發芽率明顯的 下降,間歇式乾燥之發芽率較連續式乾燥為高...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Collapse-type {{shrinkage}} is {{the greatest}} obstacle to prevent planted eucalypts from being used for solid wood products. In {{order to make the}} suitable drying schedules for high effective utilization of eucalypt wood, the total shrinkage and collapse on two species of difficult-to-dry E. urophylla and E. grandis wood under continuous and intermittent drying regimes were measured. The results show that total shrinkage and collapse in both eucalypts exhibited higher values for <b>continuous</b> <b>drying</b> than intermittent drying. With increasing drying temperature, total shrinkage and collapse increase in both drying regimes, while the increasing magnitude of both parameters becomes apparently larger for <b>continuous</b> <b>drying</b> than intermittent drying regime, in particular higher temperature condition. Properly elevating drying temperature {{to make up for the}} intermittent-waiting time may be allowed for intermittent drying regime. Drying duration at each intermittent drying period has a greater effect on total shrinkage and collapse of eucalypt wood. When more than a drying duration of 6 hours at an intermittent drying period is used, the differences in shrinkage and collapse between both drying regimes are very slight. Intermittent duration at an intermittent drying period has a comparatively larger effect on total shrinkage and collapse. Accordingly, we may draw a conclusion that intermittent drying regime is very likely to be a potential drying one suitable for collapse-prone lower-density plantation-grown eucalypt wood...|$|E

40|$|Post-harvest drying prolongs seed {{survival}} in air-dry storage; previous research showed benefit from drying moist rice seeds at temperatures greater than recommended for genebanks (5 - 20 °C). The {{aim of this}} study was to determine whether there is a temperature limit for safely drying rice seeds, and to explore whether the benefit to longevity is caused by high-temperature stress or continued seed development. Seeds of two rice varieties were harvested at different stages of development and dried initially either over silica gel, or intermittently (8 h d- 1) or continuously (24 h d- 1) over MgCl 2 at temperatures between 15 and 60 °C for up to 3 d. Seeds dried more rapidly the warmer the temperature. Subsequent seed longevity in hermetic storage (45 °C with 60 % equilibrium RH) was substantially improved by increase in drying temperature up to 45 °C in both cultivars, and also with further increase from 45 to 60 °C in cv. ‘Macassane’. The benefit of high-temperature drying to subsequent longevity tended to diminish the later the stage of development at seed harvest. Intermittent or <b>continuous</b> <b>drying</b> at high temperatures provided broadly similar improvements to longevity, but with the greatest improvements detected in a few treatment combinations with <b>continuous</b> <b>drying.</b> Heated-air drying of rice seeds harvested before maturity improved their subsequent storage longevity by more than that which occurred during subsequent development in planta, which may have resulted from the triggering of protection mechanisms in response to high-temperature stress...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the factors}} which {{affect the quality of}} rice during milling is {{internal}} fissures created during and after drying operation. In many industrial countries intermittent drying method is hired to reduce the moisture content of rough rice {{in order to reduce the}} drying time and maintain the quality of the final product. A high percentage of rice breakage during milling process, at least in Iran, necessitates performing the intermittent drying process and optimize it for Iranian varieties. In this study, the effect of this method (drying-tempering) and <b>continuous</b> <b>drying</b> method (no tempering) on fissuring percentage of Hashemi (long grain) and Koohsar (medium grain) varieties was investigated. The experiments were carried out at constant drying and tempering temperature of 60 °C, drying durations of 20, 40 and 60 min, and tempering durations of 0 (<b>continuous</b> <b>drying),</b> 40, 80, 120, 160, 200, 240 min. The results revealed that the tempering process significantly reduced the drying time and ﬁssured kernels percentage. Moreover, for both varieties it was observed that the rice fissuring decreased significantly by continuing the tempering process until certain durations. Overall, for optimization of intermittent drying process in terms of the considered qualitative parameters, i. e. reducing energy consumption and losses, conducting 160 and 200 min tempering process after 40 min drying was found appropriate for Hashemi and Koohsar varieties, respectively. In addition, according to the higher fissuring for Koohsar (medium grain) compared to Hashemi (long grain), it can be concluded that physical properties such as kernel slenderness ratio is effective on its fissuring...|$|E
