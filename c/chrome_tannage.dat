40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to find out the appropiate of <b>chrome</b> <b>tannage</b> level for rabbit fur leather quality. The result were {{expected}} to contribute information for many people who relate with tanning technology, especialy about the use level of <b>chrome</b> <b>tannage</b> for fur leather quality and could as patern to hold further research. The material that used were 12 pieces of three months of rabbit skin. The method is Completely Randomized Design, consist of three treatments of <b>chrome</b> <b>tannage</b> (Chromosal B), they were : B 1 (Chromosal B 6 %), B 2 (Chromosal B 8 %), and B 3 (Chromosal B 10 %). Each of treatment hold on four replications. The variables which measured are tearing strength, stitch teraing strength, water absorption and organoleptic consist of “kekuatan bulu”’ “kerataan bulu” and “kelemasan kulit” in fur leather. Data was analysed by analysis variance followed by Duncan’s Multiple Range Test. The result of this research show that the use level of chromosal B give very significant influence among tearing strength, stitch tearing strength and water absorption. It gave significant influence among the organoleptic test. Based on the result, can be concluded that 10 percent of <b>chrome</b> <b>tannage</b> (chromosal B), produce the best result on tearing strength, stitch tearing strength, water absorption and organoleptic for “kekuatan bulu” and “kerataan bulu”. The incrase of <b>chrome</b> <b>tannage</b> offer will decrease the “kelemasan kulit” in fur leather and the best “kelemasan kulit” produced by the lowest <b>chrome</b> <b>tannage</b> offer, that was 6 percent of Chromosal B.

40|$|Abstract. Tannic acid (TA) was {{modified}} by sulfanilic acid (SAA) using HRP catalysis in aqueous phase. The structure of modified TA {{was characterized by}} FTIR. The tanning properties of modified TA have been studied by the tanning test together with aluminum and chrome tannages. The tanning {{results show that the}} modified TA is suitable for use as pretannage and in combinaton with chrome and aluminum tannage. The shrink temperature (Ts) of leather tanned using 6 % modified TA and 2 % <b>chrome</b> <b>tannage</b> can reach to 92. 0 o C by the modified TA and and <b>chrome</b> <b>tannage</b> by sequential step. The applied leather has merits of good uniformity, fullness, softness and fine grain. With this method, the dosage of <b>chrome</b> <b>tannage</b> is lessened and environment pollution is alleviated...|$|E
40|$|Leather is {{a natural}} {{material}} {{that can be used}} in different environments and often under aggressive environmental conditions that may cause premature ageing. The most important factors influencing the degradation of leather are temperature, relative humidity and UV radiation. Leathers with <b>chrome</b> <b>tannage</b> and wet-white leathers were exposed to weathering effects using a climatic chamber in order to identify the most important variables affecting this weathering process and to check for interactions. Both a multilevel centralized factorial experimental design and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) have been employed as statistical tools for estimating the effects of the parameters.

40|$|Ecological {{pressures}} on chromium have now forced the leather industry {{to look for}} possible alternatives. A vegetable- aluminum combination tannage has been studied, with special attention being given to intended final product. Aluminum is mineral tanning agents that are widely used to stabilize collagens in the leather industry. In this study, the crosslinking of vegetable and aluminum, with collagens, have been explored. This kind of <b>chrome</b> free <b>tannage</b> give us leathers with shrinkage temperature around 125 oC, elongation at break 65. 6 %, tensile strength 38 N/mm 2, and tear strength 98 N/mm. The chemical properties of the combination tanned leathers {{are found to be}} quite normal. Among the combination system evaluated, a vegetable pretannage followed by retannage with basic aluminum sulphate was found to produce stronger leather with the durable characteristics. In contrast, pre-tanning with aluminum possibly tightens the collagen fiber network, preventing high molecular weight vegetable tannins from interacting with collagen fibres. Optimal results were obtained when 10 % (w/w) vegetable tannins (garad) and 2 % Aluminum sulphate was used...|$|R

40|$|An {{alternative}} pickle-chrome tannage {{step with}} a lower inherent potential environmental impact than the traditional one was developed. The innovative process {{is based on the}} use of tanning products containing chrome(III) salts with less astringency than the traditional ones. The use of sodium chloride and sulfuric acid is avoided and a significant reduction of chlorides and sulphates dissolved in the exhaust baths is obtained. The technical feasibility of the innovative <b>chrome</b> <b>tannage</b> process was experimentally explored. Several experimental activities have been performed, both on a pilot scale and on an semi-industrial scale, in order to assess the quality of the finished leather obtained by the new pickle-free tanning process. The results have shown that the finished leathers are comparable to the ones obtained by the traditional process in terms of physical-mechanical and technical properties. Besides, a LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) analysis was performed in order to check the actual reduction in environmental burdens due to the process proposed by the authors, in comparison with the traditional pickle-based one...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} 30 years leather {{technology}} literature {{has been dominated}} by ways to reduce the environmental impact of leather production and techniques to reduce the discharge of chromium reagents have been a significant element in these endeavours. At present, no tanning agent is able to replace completely the basic chromium sulphate in the production of all the articles range with a comparable quality, manufacturing cost and easiness of execution. The chrome tanning processes based on partial replacement of chromium, are more realistic(1). Consequently, in addition to the metal-free tanning, that complies with the request of a limited range of leather utilization, the research must be direct towards the improvement of the chromium fixation, by its using only in the retannage phase on the precedently pretanned hides. - Unbound chrome in the wet tanned leather in conventional <b>chrome</b> <b>tannage</b> Altough the processes for treating residual chrome tanning float (direct recycling or precipitation and re-dissolution) are apparently satisfactory, unfortunately they do not solve the problem of chrome pollution (2).

40|$|The many {{advantages}} offered by chrome tanning justify its widespread use for production {{of almost all}} types of leather. However, the traditional chromium(III) tanning process is constantly under threat from the pressure of legislation and ever-tightening restrictions require to minimize chromium-containing effluents discharge and chromium-containing wastes production. Recently, the manufacture and use of chromium(III) free tanning agents compounds have been studied intensively. Aluminum, zirconium and titanium compounds {{has been found to}} be an effective alternative to chromium salts. In particular, titanium is abundant in nature, easily obtainable and non-toxic. So, titanium tanning is one of the most promising replacements for chromium tanning in today’s leather industry. In this study we investigated the use of titanium salts as tanning agent for the production of high quality bovine upper leather. The technical feasibility of the innovative titanium tannage process was experimentally explored. Several experimental activities have been performed, carrying out tests of chrome and titanium tanning on two different types of skins to assess the quality of the finished leathers obtained by new titanium tannage compared to the leathers obtained by traditional <b>chrome</b> <b>tannage.</b> The results have shown that the finished leathers are appropriate for different final uses and are comparable to the ones obtained by the conventional chromium process in terms of physical-mechanical properties...|$|E
