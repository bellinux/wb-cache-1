Baptism also signifies regeneration and remission of sin. Reformed Christians believe that the children of those who express faith in Christ should be baptized.

Although this plan did not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>fruition,</b> certain key objectives from it were established in other ways: additional stations were built, all-day service to Whitby and Burlington was established and networks of buses and trains interconnected the network.|$|E
5|$|A Tom Swift media project {{finally came}} to {{fruition}} in 1983 when Willie Aames appeared as Tom Swift along with Lori Loughlin as Linda Craig in a television special, The Tom Swift and Linda Craig Mystery Hour, which was broadcast on July 3.

It was formed in March 1940, and covered the central portion of New South Wales. Headquartered at Sydney, Central Area Command was primarily responsible for air defence, aerial reconnaissance and protection of the sea lanes within its boundaries. It was disbanded in August 1941 and control of its units taken over by other RAAF formations.

5|$|In 1836, the Reverend Richard Hill {{had a fit}} of {{apoplexy}} in the vestry and died. Soon {{after this}} dramatic event, and while the church was still in mourning, the Right Reverend William Grant Broughton was installed as Bishop of Australia during a service in St James' lasting five hours. Since Macquarie's {{plans for a new}} cathedral on George Street had not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>fruition,</b> Broughton acted as if St James' were a pro-cathedral. Robert Cartwright and then Napoleon Woodd succeeded Richard Hill at St James'.|$|E
5|$|In November 1953, it was {{suggested}} that the existing two episodes could be combined and followed with a condensed live production of {{the latter part of the}} story for a special Christmas omnibus repeat of the serial. This idea was abandoned.

5|$|After {{the death}} of Harold at the Battle of Hastings, Stigand worked with Earl Edwin and Earl Morcar, as well as Archbishop Ealdred of York, to put Edgar the Ætheling on the throne. This plan did not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>fruition,</b> however, due to {{opposition}} from the northern earls {{and some of the}} other bishops. Stigand submitted to William the Conqueror at Wallingford in early December 1066, and perhaps assisted at his coronation on Christmas Day, 1066, although the coronation was performed by Ealdred. William took Stigand with him to Normandy in 1067, although whether this was because William did not trust the archbishop, as the medieval chronicler William of Poitiers alleges, is uncertain. Stigand was present at the coronation of William's queen, Matilda, in 1068, although once more the ceremony was actually performed by Ealdred.|$|E

At Elimination Chamber, Christian eliminated Sheamus before being eliminated himself by Bryan. On the March 24 episode of Raw, Christian won a fatal four-way match including Alberto Del Rio, Dolph Ziggler and Sheamus to challenge Big E for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, which did not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>fruition</b> due to Christian suffering a concussion and this was his final match.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Love Productions {{approached}} the BBC {{with the idea}} for a programme that would feature a prominent member of the business community working with unemployed people, but the show did not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>fruition</b> after the unnamed individual had to withdraw from it because of other commitments. The format for the series that would later become Benefits Street was then suggested, but the BBC declined to commission the series because it was producing a number of other programmes concerning similar issues, such as People Like Us and Nick and Margaret: We All Pay Your Benefits. Love Productions then suggested the format to Channel 4, who agreed to commission the programme.|$|E

On 27 August, Dassier confirmed that the club had reached an agreement on a loan fee with Newcastle for the transfer of Ben Arfa with personal terms being the only stumbling block in the deal. Marseille agreed to a £2million loan fee. Newcastle had been set to pay Marseille another £5million if Ben Arfa had made 25 club appearances in the 2010–11 season, which would have made the transfer permanent.|$|E
5|$|Poverty, {{the decline}} of the wool {{industry}} in the mid-18th century, increased industrialisation, and rising food prices led to some unrest amongst the inhabitants of Frome, and there were riots during the century. By 1791, the town was described in less flattering terms than those Defoe had used 70 years earlier. In the early 19th century, plans were developed to reinvigorate the town and once again elevate it to its former position as a more important town than Bath. These plans, the idea of a local businessman, Thomas Bunn, mostly failed to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>fruition,</b> although some public buildings were erected and a wide new approach road to the town centre from the south was cut (named Bath Street after the landowner, Lord Bath of Longleat House).|$|E
5|$|SR56 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1959 as Legislative Route278, and was renumbered SR56 in the 1964 state highway renumbering.

The two ends were not connected until the middle portion of the freeway was completed in 2004. The delay was largely due to funding issues and environmental concerns.|$|E
