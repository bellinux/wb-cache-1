25|$|During 1928-1929, the IFTU broadened its {{contacts}} to the Middle East, Asia and Australia. <b>Citrine,</b> {{like his}} predecessor Purcell, {{had seen the}} geographic limitations of IFTU as a major weakness of the organization. In 1928, IFTU organized a meeting in Buenos Aires, which formed the short-lived Confederación Obrera Ibero Americana.

25|$|Amethyst {{is a form}} of quartz {{that ranges}} from a bright to dark or dull purple color. The world's largest {{deposits}} of amethysts can be found in Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay, Russia, France, Namibia and Morocco. Sometimes amethyst and <b>citrine</b> are found growing in the same crystal. It is then referred to as ametrine. An amethyst is formed when there is iron in the area where it was formed.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{financial}} crisis and rise of fascism, the bonds between IFTU and the Labour and Socialist International were strengthened. Effectively the political situation radicalized the IFTU. In April 1931, a IFTU General Council meeting held in Madrid decided to shift the IFTU demand for 44-hour working-week to demanding 40-hour working week. Ahead of the 1932 disarmament conference of the League of Nations, the IFTU president <b>Citrine</b> and the LSI president Emile Vandervelde drafted an appeal against war and fascism. The appeal was signed by 14 million people.|$|E
25|$|The abdication crisis {{became public}} in the first {{fortnight}} of December 1936. At this time Churchill publicly gave his support to the King. The first public meeting of the Arms and the Covenant Movement was on 3 December. Churchill was a major speaker and later wrote that in replying to the Vote of Thanks, he made a declaration 'on {{the spur of the}} moment' asking for delay before any decision was made by either the King or his Cabinet. Others including <b>Citrine,</b> who chaired the meeting, wrote that Churchill did not make such a speech. Later that night, Churchill saw the draft of the King's proposed wireless broadcast, and spoke with Beaverbrook and the King's solicitor about it.|$|E
5000|$|Crown Prince's coronet: made in Norway in 1846 by {{goldsmith}} Herman Colbjørnsen Øyset. The coronet is a corona aperta (open model), clearly modelled in {{its basic}} design on {{that of the}} Swedish Crown Prince's coronet, and made of gold and decorated with amethysts, <b>citrines,</b> peridots and rare Norwegian freshwater pearls. [...] The circlet is polished with acanthus ornamentation with a matte finish around the gemstones alternating with groups of three oak leaves set in a fan shape around a pearl. At {{the front of the}} circlet is an oval amethyst and four amethysts alternate with four <b>citrines</b> on the circlet proper. The eight triangular points of this radial crown are in a matte finish with similar acanthus ornamentation, while between each of these points they are joined to each other on either side and to the circlet itself with a pair of acanthus scrolls supporting a group of five oak leaves around a pearl similar to those on the circlet. Each of the points has two oval colored gemstones, one an amethyst, the other a peridot, the lower one being slightly larger than that above it with a small pearl above them. At the top of each point is a larger Norwegian freshwater half pearl in a trefoil setting. It is lined with a red velvet cap heavily embroidered in gold thread with the design of a large radiating star at the top surrounded by four pairs of acanthus scrolls.|$|R
2500|$|Minerva McGonagall is deputy Headmistress, head of Gryffindor House, Transfiguration professor, {{and later}} Headmistress at Hogwarts, where she began {{teaching}} in December 1956. She is first {{introduced in the}} opening chapter of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, when she meets Dumbledore at Number 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey (the home of Harry's aunt and uncle, Vernon and Petunia Dursley). McGonagall {{is described as a}} tall, rather severe-looking woman, with black hair typically drawn into a tight bun. She wears emerald green robes, a pointed hat, and always has a very prim expression. She speaks with a slight Scottish accent. She is, according to Rowling, a sprightly 70-year-old. McGonagall wears square spectacles that match the markings around the eyes of her Animagus form of a British Shorthair silver tabby cat; she has the distinction of being the first Animagus introduced in the series and being one of the few registered Animagi of the century, though she was rarely seen using the ability. Harry's immediate impression of her is of someone who is not to be crossed. She has a fondness for tartan, and her handkerchief, at least one hat, dressing gown, and dress robes are patterned with it. In the films, McGonagall often wears a Scottish brooch of a specific Scots style set with Cairngorm <b>citrines</b> and Scottish agate.|$|R
25|$|During {{the years}} of the Spanish Civil War, Zimmerman led a trade union {{campaign}} to aid the Spanish workers and civilian populations in Spain who suffered under shortages of food, clothing, and medicine. The initial impulse for this fund-raising work was an appeal that came to Dubinsky and the ILGWU from secretary general Walter Schevenels and president Walter M. <b>Citrine</b> of the International Federation of Trade Unions, which had established a Labor Solidarity Fund for the relief work. In response the ILGWU took the lead in founding the Trade Union Red Cross for Spain, with Zimmerman as chairman, Dubinsky as treasurer, and Alex Rose, of the Hat, Cap, and Millinery Workers Union, as secretary. Promoting the humanitarian effort as support to Spanish labor in the fight against fascism, the union leaders raised $125,000 by May 1937. The relief organization was later renamed Trade Union Relief for Spain, and remained in existence through early 1939.|$|E
25|$|Silicon dioxide (SiO2), {{also known}} as silica, {{is one of the}} most well-studied compounds, second only to water. Twelve {{different}} crystal modifications of silica are known, the most common being α-quartz, a major constituent of many rocks such as granite and sandstone. It is also known to occur pure as rock crystal; impure forms are known as rose quartz, smoky quartz, morion, amethyst, and <b>citrine.</b> Some poorly crystalline forms of quartz are also known, such as chalcedony, chrysoprase, carnelian, agate, onyx, jasper, heliotrope, and flint. Other modifications of silicon dioxide are known in some other minerals such as tridymite and cristobalite, as well as the much less common coesite and stishovite. Biologically generated forms are {{also known as}} kieselguhr and diatomaceous earth. Vitreous silicon dioxide is known as tectites, and obsidian, and rarely as lechatelierite. Some synthetic forms are known as keatite and W-silica. Opals are composed of complicated crystalline aggregates of partially hydrated silicon dioxide.|$|E
500|$|The {{first three}} field records of Blyth's pipit, {{including}} an atypical pale individual on the Isles of Scilly, proved difficult, but following {{the occurrence of}} trapped individuals, on Fair Isle in 1993 and Suffolk in 1994, these were accepted. Some records of <b>citrine</b> wagtail and short-toed treecreeper were accepted only after prolonged consideration. Prior to the publication in 1984 of Jonsson and Grant's stint identification paper, a number of stints (Calidris) proved difficult to assess; a paper covering four such cases was published in 1986. It included accounts of a bird on Fair Isle, originally thought Britain's first red-necked stint {{that turned out to}} be a sanderling; and a bird in Suffolk, The [...] "Felixstowe stint", which most observers at the time believed was a western sandpiper, but was in fact a semipalmated sandpiper. A previous paper details four early claims of red-necked stint, none of which were acceptable.|$|E
500|$|Posted to Britain, Burrell was {{appointed}} {{commanding officer of}} the newly commissioned N-class destroyer [...] on 15September 1941. The ship's first operation was transporting a Trade Union Congress delegation led by Sir Walter <b>Citrine</b> to Archangel, Russia. After returning to Britain, she steamed to the Indian Ocean to join Admiral Sir James Somerville's Eastern Fleet at Addu Atoll, Maldives, on 26February 1942. Following the Eastern Fleet's withdrawal to Kilindini, Kenya, Norman {{took part in the}} capture of Diego Suarez on Madagascar on 7May. Later that month, she was reassigned to the Mediterranean and in June was involved in Operation Vigorous, an unsuccessful attempt to resupply the besieged island of Malta. Transferred back to the Indian Ocean, Burrell led Norman in the second campaign of the Battle of Madagascar in September, and was mentioned in despatches on 19February 1943 for his [...] "bravery and resource" [...] during the operation. By this time Norman was escorting convoys in the Pacific, before deploying to the South Atlantic for anti-submarine duties in April–May.|$|E
500|$|As [...] fascism and militarism {{advanced}} in Europe, Lansbury's pacifist stance drew {{criticism from the}} trades union elements of his party—who controlled the majority of party conference votes. Walter <b>Citrine,</b> the TUC general secretary, commented that Lansbury [...] "thinks the country should be without defence of any kind... it certainly isn't our policy." [...] The party's 1935 annual conference took place in Brighton during October, {{under the shadow of}} Italy's impending invasion of Abyssinia. The national executive had tabled a resolution calling for sanctions against Italy, [...] which Lansbury opposed [...] as a form of economic warfare. His speech—a passionate exposition of the principles of Christian pacifism—was well received by the delegates, but immediately afterwards his position was destroyed by Ernest Bevin, the Transport and General Workers' Union leader. Bevin attacked Lansbury for putting his private beliefs before a [...] policy, agreed by all the party's main institutions, to oppose fascist aggression, and accused him of [...] "hawking your conscience round from body to body asking to be told what to do with it". Union support ensured that the sanctions resolution was carried by a huge majority; Lansbury, realising that a Christian pacifist could no longer lead the party, resigned a few days later.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Citrine</b> is {{a variety}} of quartz whose color ranges from a pale yellow to brown due to ferric impurities. Natural citrines are rare; most {{commercial}} citrines are heat-treated amethysts or smoky quartzes. However, a heat-treated amethyst will have small lines in the crystal, {{as opposed to a}} natural citrine's cloudy or smokey appearance. It is nearly impossible to differentiate between cut <b>citrine</b> and yellow topaz visually, but they differ in hardness. Brazil is the leading producer of <b>citrine,</b> with much of its production coming from the state of Rio Grande do Sul. The name is derived from the Latin word citrina which means [...] "yellow" [...] and is also the origin of the word [...] "citron". Sometimes <b>citrine</b> and amethyst can be found together in the same crystal, which is then referred to as ametrine. <b>Citrine</b> has been referred to as the [...] "merchant's stone" [...] or [...] "money stone", due to a superstition that it would bring prosperity.|$|E

2500|$|Churchill {{wrote to}} a friend: [...] "I have never heard such a squalid {{confession}} from a public man as Baldwin offered us yesterday". In 1935 Baldwin wrote to J. C. C. Davidson (in a letter now lost) saying of Churchill: [...] "If {{there is going to}} be a war – and no one can say that there is not – we must keep him fresh to be our war Prime Minister". Thomas Dugdale also claimed Baldwin said to him: [...] "If we do have a war, Winston must be Prime Minister. If he is in [...] now we shan't be able to engage in that war as a united nation". The General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Walter <b>Citrine,</b> recalled a conversation he had had with Baldwin on 5 April 1943: [...] "Baldwin thought his [...] political recovery was marvellous. He, personally, had always thought that if war came Winston would be the right man for the job".|$|E
2500|$|The next {{match between}} the two teams was played on 4 December 1935, at White Hart Lane in London, the first full {{international}} to take place between the teams in England and the first since the rise to power of Hitler and the Nazis in 1933.

[...] "No recent sporting event has been treated with such high seriousness in Germany as this match ... Between 7,500 and 8,000 Germans will travel via Dover, and special trains will bring them to London. A description broadcast throughout Germany ... Sir Walter <b>Citrine,</b> General Secretary of the TUC, in a further letter to Sir John Simon, the Home Secretary, said that 'such a large and carefully organised Nazi contingent coming to London might confirm the impression among people in this country that the event is being regarded as of some political importance by the visitors'." ...|$|E
