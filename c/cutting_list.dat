5000|$|The {{theory was}} that with so many copies of the rushes, there could always be one machine cued up to replay the next shot in real time. Changing the play list could be done easily, and the results seen immediately. The Montage system {{generated}} significant interest and systems were installed in several post-production houses, primarily in Manhattan and LA. The system allowed tracking the 3/2 field pulldown when film was transferred to video via telecine so that a frame-accurate negative <b>cutting</b> <b>list</b> could be generated from a Montage play list. The first feature edited on the Montage was Sidney Lumet's [...] "Power". Notably, Francis Coppola edited [...] "Godfather III" [...] on the system, and Stanley Kubrick used it for [...] "Full Metal Jacket". It was used on several episodic TV shows ("Knott's Landing", for one) and on hundreds of commercials and music videos. The original system won an Academy Award for Technical Achievement in 1988.|$|E

Fans sitting in those sections could not see ¼ of the ice (including one of the nets) except on the video boards. The problem was so serious that after the team's first season in Phoenix, the team had to curtain off some seats in the areas where the view was particularly obstructed, <b>cutting</b> <b>listed</b> capacity from around 18,000 seats to 16,210.|$|R
40|$|In 2006, Massachusetts {{adopted a}} new policy that prohibits home sellers from {{resetting}} their properties’ days on market through relisting. Massachusetts homes exposed to the policy change experienced a $ 16, 000 reduction in sale price relative to Rhode Island homes. Slow-moving homes suffered a greater reduction, but newer listings only had a small increase in sale price. One reason is that some buyers were unaware of sellers’ manipulation of days on market and thus unable to recognize authentically new listings. Sellers reacted to the new policy by <b>cutting</b> <b>listing</b> prices, although in towns where listing price history was transparent, sellers raised listing prices to dampen the stigma of slow sales.

25|$|Undergraduate tuition, {{room and}} board for the 2017–18 {{academic}} year was $62,000 (excluding books, personal expenditures, and health insurance), making Drew among the most expensive private universities in New Jersey. In September 2017, the school {{announced that it was}} <b>cutting</b> the <b>list</b> price of its tuition for the 2018-19 school year by 20%, from $48,300 to $36,600, {{as part of an effort}} to make the school more appealing to prospective students who had been deterred by the sticker price, which had been one of the state's highest.|$|R
5000|$|In 1793, the French Revolution {{put an end}} to monastic life in Moissac. The abbey {{church of}} St Pierre is {{relatively}} intact and is still an active church, but the outlying buildings have suffered considerably. In the middle of the 19th century, the laying of a railway track threatened the cloister but it was saved (though the refectory was demolished to facilitate the railway <b>cutting)</b> and <b>listed</b> as a historic monument. Since 1998 the church and cloisters have had international protection as part of a World Heritage Site, [...] "Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France".|$|R

40|$|Internet Coordinates Systems (ICS) {{are used}} to predict Internet {{distances}} with limited measurements. However the precision of an ICS is degraded {{by the presence of}} Triangle Inequality Violations (TIVs). Simple methods have been proposed to detect TIVs, based e. g. on the empirical observation that a TIV is more likely when the distance is underestimated by the coordinates. In this paper, we apply supervised machine learning techniques to try and derive more powerful criteria to detect TIVs. We first show that (ensembles of) Decision Trees (DTs) learnt on our datasets are very good models for this problem. Moreover, our approach brings out a discriminative variable (called OREE), which combines the classical estimation error with the variance of the estimated distance. This variable alone is as good as an ensemble of DTs, and provides a much simpler criterion. If every node of the ICS sorts its neighbours according to OREE, we show that <b>cutting</b> these <b>lists</b> after a given number of neighbours, or when OREE crosses a given threshold value, achieves very good performance to detect TIVs.

5000|$|It was at Prestwould Plantation that Lady Skipwith had {{her garden}} built. [...] The {{archives}} reflect orders for vegetables, roots and bulbs grown in raised beds. Orange and lemon trees were grown in pots and brought indoors during the winter. Plans show the layouts of gardens for verbena, strawberry, crocus, phlox, violets, pansies, and portulaca, {{as well as}} annuals and shrubbery. [...] Lady Skipwith listed the many wildflowers she collected, including trillium and viola, identifying them from Philip Miller's Gardener's Dictionary—and noting {{when they were not}} in that source. Her wildflowers grew in her garden, but also on a nearby island. She recorded each, with details for best location and how it propagated, such as the [...] "blue funnel flower", which Ann Leighton tells us is now known as the Virginia bluebell. She kept records of her fruit crops, notes on how to raise trees from <b>cuttings,</b> and <b>lists</b> of what she planted. She ordered from Prince Nurseries on Long Island, as did George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.|$|R

As well as renewing the signalling, three junctions at Trowell, Ironville and Codnor Park will be redesigned and rebuilt.Since the existing Midland Main Line from Derby through the Derwent Valley has a number of tunnels and <b>cuttings</b> which are <b>listed</b> buildings and it is a World Heritage Area, it seems that the Erewash line is ripe for expansion. As the new signalling is rolled out, train detection is moving away from the traditional Track circuit detection of trains to Axle counting.|$|R

5000|$|Davies {{became a}} {{judge of the}} High Court in 1973, {{receiving}} the customary knighthood. He {{was assigned to the}} Queen's Bench Division. As the senior judge, he became Keeper of the Juries List in 1988, taking charge of the limited number of English civil cases - principally defamation cases - in which a judge continues to sit as arbiter of the law, with a jury as tribunal of fact. As a result, he sat on many high-profile cases, many of which were won by plaintiffs who were awarded ever large sums in damages. He was very active in managing the number and turnover of cases on the <b>list,</b> <b>cutting</b> the number of cases on the list from around 240 in 1988, when he was appointed, to only 50 cases two years later. The time before a case came to trial was also reduced from three years to only one. [...] Davies was the judge in the case brought by Koo Stark in 1988, against newspapers that had claimed she had an adulterous affair with The Duke of York. He was also the judge in a successful libel case brought in 1990 by Sonia Sutcliffe, wife of the Yorkshire Ripper, against Private Eye, which alleged that she had sold her life story to the Daily Mail. She was initially awarded then-record damages of £600,000 (reduced to £60,000 on appeal). Ian Hislop, editor of Private Eye, said {{on the steps of the}} court after losing the case: [...] "If that's justice, then I'm a banana."http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/24/newsid_2503000/2503595.stm ...|$|R
