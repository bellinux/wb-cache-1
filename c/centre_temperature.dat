In this paper, three periods LANDSAT {{remote sensing image}} were applied to analysis the changes of urban thermal environment in Chongqing China. The results indicated the processes and trends of urban thermal environment change in Chongqing urban. The spatial-temporal changes of Chongqing urban thermal environment were obvious from 1993 a to 2004 a. The area of higher surface temperature regions increased from 1993 a to 2001 a, and decreased from 2001 a to 2004 a. The spatial distribution of six temperature regions changed too. Where, highest temperature regions spatial distribution in 2004 a was most dispersed, in which the area of highest <b>temperature</b> <b>centres</b> was the largest, but the area of single thermal centre was the smallest. And the total of high <b>temperature</b> <b>centres</b> in 1993 a was the least, but the area of single high <b>temperature</b> <b>centre</b> was largest.

In this respect, an experimental, modeling and literature-survey investigation was conducted. In the experiments, several spheres and cylinders were cooled in air and water flows, and their <b>centre</b> <b>temperatures</b> measured. In the modeling part, a methodology was used to determine the cooling parameters, and using experimental data, together with some experimental data from the literature, the following Fourier-Reynolds correlations for half and seven-eighths cooling times were developed: Fos = 0 Â· 3693 Re- 0 Â· 11871 and Foz = 1 Â· 2951 Re- 0 Â· 16003 respectively for water-cooling applications; Fos = 42 Â· 465 Re- 0 Â· 54426 and Foz = 125 Â· 21 Re- 0 Â· 53913 respectively for air-cooling applications. The {{results of the present study}} show that there is a strong relationship between the Fourier and Reynolds numbers, and the developed Fourier-Reynolds correlations reasonably determine the cooling thermal parameters for spherical or cylindrical bodies cooled in water and air flows.

However, the two temperatures diverge as the oven temperature increases. From a theoretical perspective, Chen’s method yields fundamental kinetic parameters, provided that the first order kinetic rate model holds. On the other hand, Jones’ method results in estimates of apparent kinetic parameters that nonetheless could be useful for ranking materials for their tendency to self ignite (Chen 1999).
