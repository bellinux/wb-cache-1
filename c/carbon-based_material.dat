The THz-TDS of <b>carbon-based</b> <b>materials</b> {{has been}} especially useful for understanding of many fundamental physical properties (e. g. the electronic structure and electron-phonon interactions, etc.) of all sp 2 carbons, given that <b>carbon-based</b> <b>materials</b> can be either semiconducting or metallic depending on their geometric structures.

30|$|A {{number of}} {{previous}} studies have confirmed that <b>carbon-based</b> <b>materials</b> and their related materials possess the ability to induce hMSC differentiation into specific lineages. Specifically, the use of <b>carbon-based</b> <b>materials</b> in combination with differentiation factors/osteoinductive agents (e.g. peptides, proteins, growth factors) have been reported. These materials were found {{to act as an}} attracting signal for the osteogenesis of MSCs, as well as for bone cells to promote the bone regeneration process. Among several <b>carbon-based</b> <b>materials,</b> graphene and graphene derivatives have shown great potential for stem cell research, due in part to their unique physicochemical properties such as high surface area, ease of functionalization, and low cytotoxicity. These properties are superior to other types of <b>carbon-based</b> <b>materials</b> in term of embedding drugs/growth factors and enhancing cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of hMSCs into osteogenic lineages.|$|R

50|$|Neptune has a {{planetary}} ring system, though one much less substantial {{than that of}} Saturn. The rings may consist of ice particles coated with silicates or <b>carbon-based</b> <b>material,</b> which most likely gives them a reddish hue. The three main rings are the narrow Adams Ring, 63,000 km from the centre of Neptune, the Le Verrier Ring, at 53,000 km, and the broader, fainter Galle Ring, at 42,000 km. A faint outward extension to the Le Verrier Ring has been named Lassell; it is bounded at its outer edge by the Arago Ring at 57,000 km.|$|E
50|$|An ember is a glowing, hot coal made of greatly heated wood, coal, {{or other}} <b>carbon-based</b> <b>material</b> that remain after, or {{sometimes}} precede, a fire. Embers can glow very hot, sometimes {{as hot as}} the fire which created them. They radiate {{a substantial amount of}} heat long after the fire has been extinguished, and if not taken care of properly can rekindle a fire that is thought to be completely extinguished and can pose a fire hazard. In order to avoid the danger of accidentally spreading a fire, many campers pour water on the embers or cover them in dirt. Alternatively, embers can be used to relight a fire after it has gone out without the need to rebuild the fire - In a conventional fireplace, a fire can easily be relit up to 12 hours after it goes out, provided that there is enough space for air to circulate between the embers and the introduced fuel.|$|E
5000|$|A 2007 {{study done}} by Wildlife International, Ltd. {{determined}} a lactylate's ready biodegradability by {{the carbon dioxide}} evolution test method. The study was performed on a LEFA sodium salt produced from oleic acid and lactic acid. The test method determines if microbes, in this case activated sludge inoculum, can digest a test material, thereby returning the <b>carbon-based</b> <b>material</b> back into the environment as carbon dioxide to complete the carbon cycle. To meet or exceed the OECD Guideline 301B criteria for [...] "readily biodegradable", a sample must produce 60% of the theoretical amount of carbon dioxide (TCO2) within a 10-day window of reaching 10% TCO2. The LEFA {{used in the study}} had a final average cumulative percent biodegradation of 92.0% and the test solution had a pH of 7.1 {{at the end of the}} 28-day test. Therefore, the test material met the criteria to be considered readily biodegradable. In the presence of water, lactylates will break down (hydrolyze) into fatty acid and lactic acid. Based on all available information, lactylates do not meet any hazard categories under SARA Title III, Sections 311-313.|$|E

Thereafter, carbon monoxide (CO 2) in the atmospheric pressure is passed over the electrodes in the Pyrex glass tube chamber where the carbon strand fabrication process takes place.

From these ascorbates lithium and magnesium ascorbate showed the greatest activity toward cathode oxygen reduction process. Also mixtures with well-known examined antioxidants ascorbate (glucose, dihydroquercetin) were investigated at different concentrations of components.

3000|$|These {{improvements}} of the photovoltaic {{properties of}} DSSCs through the re-engineering of their CEs {{are believed to}} be due to the decoration of <b>carbon-based</b> <b>material</b> with metal NPs that permits to change the work function value of the <b>carbon-based</b> <b>material,</b> obtaining values as closer as possible to the work function of FTO-glass [24] and facilitating thereby the transfer of electrons from the FTO to the electrolyte solution. As recently reported in literature [18, 19, 20], the decoration of carbon nanotubes with cobalt or nickel compounds, such as CoS or FeNi, permits to substitute the expensive platinum coating with transition metals without loss of electrocatalytic activity. Indeed, Xing et al. [22] replaced Pt with N-doped CNTs decorated with Nickel and Cobalt NPs obtained from the calcination at 700  °C of NiCl 2 and CoCl 2 precursors. Moreover, they have used H 2 SO 4 (a toxic and hazardous reagent) to remove metal residues on the CNTs’ surface.

We show that initially hydrogen undergoes a sequential dissociative chemisorption upon interacting with the Pt- 6 cluster. The threshold desorption energy of H atoms was identified. We then mapped out the energetics required for hydrogen atoms to flow onto the surfaces of the selected materials {{in the vicinity of}} the subnanometer Pt- 6 particle and to diffuse to other sites of the substrates. Our results indicate that while the spillover of H atoms onto the MoO 3 lattice can be greatly facilitated by the abundant H-bonding network, the process becomes energetically difficult on <b>carbon-based</b> <b>materials</b> via chemisorption since it requires C-H bond breaking. Spillover in the selected <b>carbon-based</b> <b>materials</b> could only become possible if 'cold' H atoms could come out of the saturated catalyst...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explored}} a {{new approach}} to prepare phase change microcapsules using carbon-based particles via Pickering emulsions for energy storage applications. Rice-husk-char, a by-product in biofuel production, containing 53. 58 wt% of carbon was used as a model <b>carbon-based</b> <b>material</b> to encapsulate hexadecane. As a model phase change material, hexadecane was emulsified in aqueous suspensions of rice-husk-char nanoparticles. Water soluble polymers poly(diallyldimethyl-ammonium chloride) and poly(sodium styrene sulfonate) were used to fix the rice-husk-char nanoparticles on the emulsion droplets through layer-by-layer assembly to enhance the structural stability of the microcapsules. The microcapsules formed are composed of a thin shell encompassing a large core consisting of hexadecane. Thermal gravimetrical and differential scanning calorimeter analyses showed the phase change enthalpy of 80. 9 kJ kg− 1 or 120. 0 MJ m− 3.
