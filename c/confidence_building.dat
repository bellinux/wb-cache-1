25|$|The Indian Cricket League's ongoing {{tournament in}} Ahmedabad was canceled. The two {{remaining}} One Day Internationals {{of the seven}} match series between the visiting England cricket team and India were cancelled. The visiting team flew home, but returned to continue the test series. However, the venue of the second India-England test match, scheduled on 19–23 December, was shifted from Mumbai to Chennai. The inaugural Twenty20 Champions League, scheduled from 3 to 10 December, Mumbai {{being one of the}} host cities, was postponed. The attacks have brought into significance the issue of 379 Indian boats and 336 fishermen apprehended by the Pakistan marine agency, for entering their waters. Nearly 200 of the boats have reportedly been auctioned, now recognised as a national security issue for India. On 28 November, Pakistan released 99 fishermen who were apprehended, as part of <b>confidence</b> <b>building</b> measures with India. There were threats to blow up ITC Fortune Hotel in Navi Mumbai, after Mumbai police received a bomb threat from terrorists. Rumours about further shootings at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus were doing the rounds in Mumbai on 28 November, and were widely reported by the news channels.

2500|$|The Economist {{magazine}} {{opined that}} [...] "even {{before the election}} of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Iran was negotiating in bad faith. During this period, European officials believe, it continued to work in secret on nuclear research, having promised to suspend uranium enrichment." [...] The Iranians attributed the concealment of portions of their nuclear program {{to the fact that}} the US hampered their overt attempts at acquiring the necessary technology for their program, and also point out that they promised to suspend enrichment rather than cease all research. After about two years, Iran ceased its voluntary and temporary suspension of enrichment after receiving a [...] "very insulting and humiliating" [...] offer which some analysts described as an [...] "empty box". In response, the West rejected an Iranian offer for a nuclear consortium in Iran and said they would go to the Security Council for sanctions. Iran says its voluntary <b>confidence</b> <b>building</b> measures were only [...] "reciprocated by broken promises and expanded requests" [...] and that the EU3 [...] "simply wanted prolonged and fruitless negotiations" [...] to inhibit Iran from exercising its inalienable right to peaceful nuclear technology.

2500|$|Art therapy {{may be a}} {{beneficial}} treatment for incarcerated women. A residential substance abuse program called New Beginnings in a detention facility has used art therapy {{as a means of}} treatment for incarcerated women. The therapy sessions were weekly and lasted 2 hours. During the first 15 minutes of the art therapy session, the topic of therapy was discussed. The topics were self-esteem, fear, self-defeating behaviors, treatment goals, barriers for recovery, and self-sabotage. The clients then worked on an exercise relating to the topic for 45 minutes in tables of four. Exploring deeper thoughts, positive reinforcement and feedback, <b>confidence</b> <b>building,</b> and clarification of thinking were encouraged by the art therapist. The clients were resistant at first, claiming [...] "I can't draw." [...] However, they began to share their works and offer insight on other inmates' work after one or two sessions. Group cohesion increased after the inmates began expressing different perspectives on their work and others. Simple art media was offered, to ensure that the clean-up process and technique of the materials was not difficult or intimidating. Art therapy in the program was used to help clients recognize their defense mechanisms that conceal their fear of inadequacy or {{to create a sense of}} safety and peace, increase confidence, express feelings verbally, and identify feelings. Therefore, art therapy can be used as a tool in incarceration settings with women for mental health and substance abuse.|$|E

50|$|<b>Confidence</b> <b>Building</b> in the Arms Control Process: A Transformation View sees {{conventional}} {{understandings of}} <b>confidence</b> <b>building</b> as incomplete {{and focuses on}} why and how developing confidence-building arrangements can help to improve security relations. <b>Confidence</b> <b>building,</b> according to the transformation view, is a distinct activity undertaken by policy makers with the minimum intention of improving some aspects of a traditionally antagonistic security relationship through security policy coordination and cooperation. It entails the comprehensive process of exploring, negotiating, and then implementing tailored measures, including those that promote interaction, information exchange, and constraint. It also entails the {{development and use of}} both formal and informal practices and principles associated with the cooperative development of CBMs. When conditions are supportive, the <b>confidence</b> <b>building</b> process can facilitate, focus, synchronize, amplify, and generally structure the potential for a significant positive transformation in the security relations of participating states. Thus, the confidence-building process involves more than simply the production of a <b>confidence</b> <b>building</b> agreement and definitely {{should not be confused with}} what specific CBMs do.|$|E
