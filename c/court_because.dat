5|$|In 1821, Sharp began a {{campaign}} for {{a seat in the}} Kentucky Senate. His opponent, attorney John U. Waring, was a notably violent and contentious man, frequently in <b>court</b> <b>because</b> of altercations. (In 1835, he shot and killed the attorney Samuel Q. Richardson).|$|E
5|$|Maia {{submitted}} {{an appeal}} to the Supreme <b>Court,</b> <b>because</b> Maia could not easily meet her children. On May 14, 2013 the Supreme Court decided that the children could choose themselves since the children were considered capable to make a decision. Dhani agreed with it.|$|E

5|$|Haraldr Guðrøðarson's reign {{was not a}} long one. In 1250, {{the chronicle}} records that he was summoned by letter to the Norwegian royal <b>court</b> <b>because</b> Hákon was displeased at how Haraldr Guðrøðarson had wrongfully seized the kingship which was not his by right. The chronicle notes that the Norwegian king {{intended}} that Haraldr Guðrøðarson should never return to Mann, and he was consequently kept from returning to the island-kingdom. Nothing further is heard from him.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to Massachusetts, where he remained politically {{active in the}} state. He established Republican dominance in Worcester, even though the state was dominated by Federalists. He was elected lieutenant governor under James Sullivan in 1807, but failed to win election {{in his own right}} in 1809 in a highly partisan election. He retired from politics in 1811, declining nomination to the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>because</b> of his health. His descendants were a major influence in Worcester for much of the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} Denmark through Belgium on 4 April 1900 Edward was {{the victim}} of an {{attempted}} assassination, when fifteen-year-old Jean-Baptiste Sipido shot at him in protest over the Boer War. Sipido, though obviously guilty, was acquitted by a Belgian <b>court</b> <b>because</b> he was underage. The perceived laxity of the Belgian authorities, combined with British disgust at Belgian atrocities in the Congo, worsened the already poor relations between the United Kingdom and the Continent. However, in the next ten years, Edward's affability and popularity, as well as his use of family connections, assisted Britain in building European alliances.|$|E
50|$|The detainees'defense {{had argued}} that {{testimony}} secured in Guantanamo {{could not be used}} in Kuwaiti <b>courts,</b> <b>because</b> the detainees and interrogators hadn't signed them.Further, they had argued, the allegations the USA had directed at them weren't violations of Kuwaiti law.|$|R
50|$|In the United States federal courts, pendent party {{jurisdiction}} {{refers to}} a court's power to adjudicate a claim against a party who would otherwise {{not be subject to}} the jurisdiction of the federal <b>courts,</b> <b>because</b> the claim arose from a common nucleus of operative fact.|$|R

5|$|The court {{rejected}} the defendant's other arguments: (1) {{that women were}} improperly excluded from the grand jury under Illinois law (as incorporated by federal jury selection law at the time); (2) that the indictment was not returned in open <b>court</b> <b>because</b> the notation indicating that the indictment was returned in open court was added after the fact; (3) that the indictment was insufficiently definite; (4) that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction; (5) that the admission of certain evidence was prejudicial; and (6) that the trial judge's own questioning of certain witnesses and limitations on cross-examination were prejudicial.|$|E
5|$|In October 1984, Gardner killed Melvyn John Otterstrom {{during a}} robbery in Salt Lake City. While being moved in April 1985 {{to a court}} hearing for the homicide, he fatally shot {{attorney}} Michael Burdell in an unsuccessful escape attempt. Convicted of two counts of murder, Gardner {{was sentenced to life}} imprisonment for the first count and received the death penalty for the second. The state adopted more stringent security measures {{as a result of the}} incident at the courthouse. While held at Utah State Prison, Gardner was charged with another capital crime for stabbing an inmate in 1994. However, that charge was thrown out by the Utah Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>because</b> the victim survived.|$|E
5|$|The Court neither {{expressly}} rejected nor {{affirmed the}} abolition of the distinction in Anisminic and its effect on the effectiveness of ouster clauses. Instead, the Court cited UK authorities holding that ouster clauses are ineffective when there has been an absence of jurisdiction or an excess of jurisdiction {{on the part of the}} decision-maker, a position which characterized the law prior to Anisminic. The Court did refer to Anisminic but only to observe that the House of Lords had held the ouster clause involved in that case to be irrelevant because a purported determination by the Foreign Compensation Commission which was legally incorrect could not be considered a real determination and had no effect at all. Ultimately, the Court quashed the order made by the Industrial Arbitration <b>Court</b> <b>because</b> it contained an error of law which had caused that court to exceed its jurisdiction.|$|E

50|$|French {{investigating}} magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguière is also pursuing {{a case against}} the current President, Paul Kagame, {{and other members of}} his administration, for the assassination of his predecessor. This case is under the regular jurisdiction of the French <b>courts</b> <b>because</b> French citizens were also killed in the plane crash.|$|R
5|$|The court {{declared}} that Hill was not validly elected at the 1998 federal election. However, {{they did not}} declare the whole election invalid, acting on an earlier decision of the <b>court,</b> <b>because</b> although no effect could be given to voters' preferences for Hill, their other preferences were not invalid, and those {{could be used to}} determine who should be elected in Hill's stead. The court did not reach a definite decision about what action should be taken, remitting that question to a lower court. Eventually, Len Harris, the number two candidate on the One Nation ticket, was elected in Hill's stead, taking up his seat on 1 July 1999.|$|E
5|$|Although John was the Count of Poitou and {{therefore}} the rightful feudal lord over the Lusignans, they could legitimately appeal John's actions in France to his own feudal lord, Philip. Hugh did exactly this in 1201 and Philip summoned John to attend court in Paris in 1202, citing the Le Goulet treaty to strengthen his case. John was unwilling to weaken his authority in western France in this way. He argued that he need not attend Philip's <b>court</b> <b>because</b> of his special status as the Duke of Normandy, who was exempt by feudal tradition from being called to the French court. Philip argued that he was summoning John not as the Duke of Normandy, but as the Count of Poitou, which carried no such special status. When John still refused to come, Philip declared John in breach of his feudal responsibilities, reassigned all of John's lands that fell under the French crown to Arthur – {{with the exception of}} Normandy, which he took back for himself – and began a fresh war against John.|$|E
5|$|On 8 April 1524, five cantons, Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, and Zug, {{formed an}} alliance, die fünf Orte (the Five States) to defend {{themselves}} from Zwingli's Reformation. They contacted the opponents of Martin Luther including John Eck, who had debated Luther in the Leipzig Disputation of 1519. Eck offered to dispute Zwingli and he accepted. However, they could not agree on {{the selection of the}} judging authority, the location of the debate, {{and the use of the}} Swiss Diet as a <b>court.</b> <b>Because</b> of the disagreements, Zwingli decided to boycott the disputation. On 19 May 1526, all the cantons sent delegates to Baden. Although Zurich's representatives were present, they did not participate in the sessions. Eck led the Catholic party while the reformers were represented by Johannes Oecolampadius of Basel, a theologian from Württemberg who had carried on an extensive and friendly correspondence with Zwingli. While the debate proceeded, Zwingli was kept informed of the proceedings and printed pamphlets giving his opinions. It was of little use as the Diet decided against Zwingli. He was to be banned and his writings were no longer to be distributed. Of the thirteen Confederation members, Glarus, Solothurn, Fribourg, and Appenzell as well as the Five States voted against Zwingli. Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, and Zurich supported him.|$|E

50|$|It was not {{possible}} for Cukurova to separately challenge {{the validity of the}} Regulations in the legal proceedings before the BVI <b>courts</b> <b>because</b> of the principle of the conflict of laws that the courts of one jurisdiction will not rule on the validity of laws in another jurisdiction under the act of state doctrine.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} was {{not mentioned}} in the original United States Constitution. The courts have recognized it both as a principle that was inherited from English common law, and as a practical, logical inference (that the government cannot be compelled by the <b>courts</b> <b>because</b> it is the power of the government that creates the courts in the first place).|$|R
25|$|Prosecutors {{initially}} {{argued for}} the public safety exception {{to be applied to}} the statements obtained before the Miranda rights were read.

25|$|Although a {{district}} court can require a defendant {{to comply with}} a preexisting child support order as a condition of supervised release, the court cannot require the defendant to pay his child support obligations at a rate different than that established by the state <b>court,</b> <b>because</b> family relations are a traditional area of state concern.|$|E
25|$|Justice John Marshall Harlan II {{agreed with}} the majority’s {{reasoning}} as it applied to the Fourteenth Amendment.

5000|$|The Judiciary Act of 1891 (...) , {{also known}} as the Evarts Act after its primary sponsor, Senator William M.

5000|$|Some public {{defenders}} {{have criticized the}} use of problem-solving <b>courts</b> <b>because</b> accused persons who accept intervention are implicitly treated as guilty; the courts do not allow an accused person to receive a determination of innocence or guilt.
