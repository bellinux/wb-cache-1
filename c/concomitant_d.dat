40|$|The {{purpose of}} this open study was to {{evaluate}} efficacy and safety of infliximab, an antiatnfa ?monoclonal antibody, in 37 children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Group 1 comprised 16 patients with severe longaterm jia with systemic onset. Group 2 comprised 21 patients with oligoa and polyarticular JIA. Groups were matched in demographic features. The follow up period has ranged between 6 weeks and 2 years. All children received infliximab and <b>concomitant</b> <b>D</b> mard therapy, 3 of them received oral glucocorticoids. Inflixa imab with a mean dose of 6, 5 ± 0, 3 mg/kg was administered intravenously at baseline, 2, 6 and every 8 week. Infliximab has shown statistically significant improvement (p < 0, 01) in all patients with early oligoa and polyarticular JIA (group 2). Remission following the second infusion (at the 3 week of observation) has been registered in all patients with oligoa and polyarticular jia, meanwhile in patients with systemic JIA remission has been registered only in 2 cases {{at a time of}} 7 months of treatment with infliximab. Eight (50 %) patients from group 1 and 2 children (9, 5 %) from group 2 discontinued infliximab due to inefficacy. 5 (24 %) of patients from group 2 developed side effects that led to infliximab discontinuation. Therefore, the therapy with infliximab has proved to be sound, safe and effective with best results in patients with oligoa and polyarticular jia.

40|$|Testosterone (T) is not {{administered}} orally, {{because it}} has been reported to be rapidly metabolized by the liver. We hypothesized that sufficient doses of T or T enanthate (TE), administered orally in oil, would result in clinically useful elevations in serum T. We also hypothesized that coadministration of dutasteride (D) with T or TE would minimize increases in serum DHT seen previously with oral administration. Therefore, we conducted a pharmacokinetic study of oral T and TE in oil, with and without <b>concomitant</b> <b>D,</b> in normal men whose T production had been temporarily suppressed by the GnRH antagonist acyline. Thirteen healthy men (mean age, 24 +/- 6 yr) were enrolled and assigned to oral T (n = 7) and oral TE (n = 6) groups and were administered 200, 400, or 800 mg of either T or TE in sesame oil in the morning on 3 successive days 24 h after receiving acyline. Blood samples for measurement of serum T and dihydrotestosterone were obtained before T or TE administration and 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 h after administration. Subjects were then administered D for 4 d before repeating the sequence of T or TE doses with D. Serum T was significantly increased in a dose-dependent fashion with the administration of oral T or TE in oil. Coadministration of D with oral T or TE significantly increased the 24 -hr average serum T levels compared with administration of T or TE alone [average serum T after 400 mg dose, 8. 7 +/- 3. 0 nmol/l (T) and 8. 3 +/- 5. 7 nmol/l (TE) vs. 16. 1 +/- 5. 8 nmol/l (T +D) and 15. 0 +/- 8. 8 nmol/l (TE + D); P < 0. 05 for T vs. T and D]. The administration of oral T or TE in oil combined with D results in unexpected and potentially therapeutic increases in serum T. Additional studies of this combination as a novel form of oral androgen therapy are warranted. ...|$|E
40|$|L-DOPA {{pharmacotherapy}} in Parkinson’s disease (PD) {{is associated}} with adverse effects occurring {{after a few years}} of treatment. Among these, dyskinesia (abnormal involuntary movements) is particularly common and potentially disabling. The causes behind dyskinesia are not completely understood, but intense research has identified a number of neuronal alterations associated with L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in both PD patients and animal models of PD. In addition to neurons, the brain consists of a dense vascular network and supportive cells. This thesis has focused on non-neuronal aspects contributing to the pathophysiology of dyskinesia. In particular, it has addressed structural and functional changes affecting the microvasculature in the basal ganglia. Using rats with unilateral 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) lesions as an animal model of PD, the first paper of this thesis demonstrates that dyskinesia induced by either direct dopamine D 1 agonism or L-DOPA, are indistinguishable at the level of angiogenic activity in the basal ganglia. Endothelial proliferation, nestin upregulation and downregulation of blood-brain barrier indices, were equally present in both D 1 - or L-DOPA-induced dyskinetic rats. Moreover, <b>concomitant</b> <b>D</b> 1 stimulation by L-DOPA and a D 2 antagonist, potentiated the angiogenic response without affecting the severity of dyskinesia. The second paper of this thesis shows that indices of angiogenesis and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are dose-dependently upregulated in the striatum and the substantia nigra pars reticulata following chronic L-DOPA treatment. Interestingly, VEGF immunoreactivity was mainly expressed in astrocytes in proximity to blood vessels. Induction of VEGF mRNA was seen in rat primary astrocytic cultures following incubation with D 1 receptor stimulation. To verify the causal involvement of VEGF in the development of dyskinesia, 6 -OHDA-lesioned rats were chronically co-treated with L-DOPA along with an inhibitor of VEGF receptor-signalling (vandetanib). Rats receiving vandetanib co-treatment, but not its vehicle, developed less severe dyskinesia and did not show a significant angiogenic response to L-DOPA. The occurrence of angiogenesis was investigated also on post mortem basal ganglia sections from PD patients. Histological indices of angiogenesis (i. e. the density of CD 34 - and nestin-immunopositive microvessels) were significantly higher in dyskinetic PD patients compared to non-dyskinetic PD cases and neurologically healthy controls. Striatal tissue samples from a separate set of dyskinetic patients showed a significant upregulation of VEGF mRNA. Prompted by the hypothesis that L-DOPA-induced angiogenesis may be accompanied by changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the affected regions, we carried out an extensive comparison of changes in rCBF and regional cerebral glucose utilization (rCGU) in unilaterally 6 -OHDA-lesioned rats both at baseline and following the administration of L-DOPA (third article in the thesis). The results of this study demonstrate robust increases in rCBF at 60 minutes following the administration of L-DOPA (“ON L-DOPA”) in the same basal ganglia nuclei that show angiogenic activity upon chronic L-DOPA treatment. The rCBF response was not always paralleled by an increase in rCGU, pointing to a direct haemodynamic effect of the treatment. By comparing the passage of a tracer molecule across the blood-brain barrier in chronically L-DOPA-treated rats, we could finally show a significantly larger accumulation of the tracer in the striatum and the substantia nigra pars reticulata at 60 minutes (“ON”) compared to 24 hours (“OFF”) following the last peripheral L-DOPA injection. In conclusion, this thesis provides evidence that dopamine replacement therapy for PD does not only affect neurons, but that important plastic changes occur {{at the level of the}} microvasculature in the basal ganglia. These changes are tightly linked to the development of a dyskinetic motor response. On the basis of these findings, it is recommended that future therapeutic initiatives for PD also consider targets that are expressed in the microvasculature and/or neurovascular coupling mechanisms that are specific to the parkinsonian brain...|$|E

40|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} metal oxide chemistry is the unusual behavior of Cu(I) and Ag(1).

This novel drug {{can be used as a}} mydriatic agent, as a provocative test in open-angle glaucoma, and for the treatment of persisting ocular hypotony. HISTORY AND SIGNS: This 47 -year-old man had a history of uveitis associated with Crohn's disease. Six years after deep sclerectomy for uveitic secondary glaucoma, he developed severe hypotony in his left eye with drop of visual acuity (VA). The hypotony did not respond to topical steroid treatment. 2 % Ibopamine solution was ordered t. i. <b>d.</b> <b>concomitant</b> to 1 % prednisolone acetate. THERAPY AND OUTCOME: Intraocular pressure (IOP) began to rise after 3 weeks of Ibopamine treatment and returned to normal (12 mmHg) with continuous recovery of VA after 8 weeks. Ibopamine was discontinued at an IOP of 16 mmHg after a course of 12 weeks. IOP and VA remained stable during the 12 -month follow-up period.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{advantage}} of hyperfractionated accelerated radiation therapy for advanced {{head and neck}} cancer has been reported. Furthermore, randomized trials and meta-analyses have confirmed the survival benefit of additional chemotherapy to radiotherapy. We retrospectively analyzed the efficiency and toxicity of the Regensburg standard therapy protocol "SCHARC" and the overall survival of our patients. Methods From 1997 to 2004, 64 patients suffering from advanced head and neck cancer (88 % stage IV, 12 % stage III) were assigned to receive the SCHARC protocol. Around half of the patients were diagnosed with oro-hypopharynx carcinoma (52 %), one third with tongue and floor of mouth tumors (29 %) and one fifth (19 %) suffered from H & N cancer at other sites. The schedule consisted of one therapy block with 30 Gy in 20 fractions over a two week period with <b>concomitant</b> chemotherapy (<b>d</b> 1 – 5 : 20 mg/m 2 /d DDP + 750 – 1000 mg/m 2 /d 5 FU (cont. infusion). This therapy block was repeated after a fortnight break up to a cumulative dose of 60 Gy and followed by a boost up to 70 Gy (69 – 70. 5 Gy). All patients assigned to this scheme {{were included in the}} survival evaluation. Results Forty patients (63 %) received both radiation and chemotherapy according to the protocol. The mean follow up was 2. 3 years (829 d) and the median follow up was 1. 9 years (678 d), respectively. The analysis of survival revealed an estimated 3 year overall survival rate of 57 %. No patient died of complications, 52 patients (80 %) had acute grade 2 – 3 mucositis, and 33 patients (58 %) suffered from acute grade 3 skin toxicity. Leucopenia was no major problem (mean nadir 3. 4 g/nl, no patient 10. 5 g/dl and for patients who completed the protocol. Conclusion The SCHARC protocol was effective in patients diagnosed with advanced head and neck cancer. It led to long-term disease control and survival in about 50 % of the patients with significant but acceptable toxicity. Most patients were not anemic at beginning of therapy. Therefore, we could assess the influence of pre-treatment hemoglobin on survival. However, a low hemoglobin nadir was associated with poor outcome. This result suggests an influence of anemia during therapy on prognosis. </p...|$|R

Below- 120 m, ledges protrude horizontally from steep cliffs of barrier eefs and atolls {{as well as}} from patches of in situ lithified slope sediment on inclined fnnging reef slopes. Free surfaces and cavities within these ledges are partly covered by laminar micrite crusts of 7 - 20 mm thickness. The ledges are formed by an organic framework of living azooxanthellate corals, bryozoans, serpulids and fossil red algae. They are affected by repeated pisodes of boring, infilling, and cementation which obliterate much of the original fabric. <b>Concomitant</b> cementation a <b>d</b> boring result in asymmetric cement linings which often show geopetal fabrics. The laminar micfite crusts, however, show no significant traces of bioerosion, which are a typical feature of fossil deep-water stromatolites. Two types of lamination have been observed: 1) vertically stacked, irregular, anastomosing laminae with ragged outlines and little lateral persistence which are often accentuated by iron staining, and 2) 0. 5 -mm-thick laminae of light-grey micnte, rich in fine bioclasts, howing smooth, thin coatings of dark homogenous micrite, which are weakly fluorescent i ultraviolet light. No algal films are preserved, but micntic tubes 10 - 30 ~m in diameter, often bifurcated, form a dense network on the upper surface of the crusts by overgrowing and binding particles. Associated aragonitie rosettes 30 [...] 40 #m in diameter may represent calcified coccoid algae or bacteria. If true, these organisms suggest a formation of the latter type of crust by biogenic processes not related to the photic zone. Fenestral porosity and Frutexites textures are absent.

40|$|The {{appearance}} of a chronic disease during childhood can have {{a great impact on}} the child’s development. The child follows a specific procedure of comprehension and adjustment, which appears to be influenced by a variety of factors and also by the specific disease characteristics, resulting in some cases in psychopathological symptoms. It is estimated that epilepsy concerns approximately 5 / 1000 children. What makes epilepsy a matter of special interest in comparison to other chronic conditions {{is that it is a}} heterogeneous CNS disorder that consists of clinical syndromes, characterized by different types of seizures, different underlying etiologies, frequency and severity, different treatment strategies and longitudinal outcomes. Moreover the age of onset for the great majority of the cases is usually in childhood and adolescence. The purpose of this study was a. to assess school attendance and participation in school activities of children and adolescents with epilepsy, b. to investigate if school is informed by the parents and if schoolmates are informed by the children themselves, c. the detection of <b>concomitant</b> psychopathology, <b>d.</b> the evaluation of stigma, overprotection, and the selfesteemated quality of life of the children and their parents and e. to determine which factors (demographic data, disease characteristics, cultural variables etc) could be correlated with all these aspects of school and family life an finally f. to compare and contrast the specific characteristics of the Christian and Muslim children with epilepsy, in the region of Thrace. This was a prospective study conducted at the University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Greece, from November 2006 to February 2008. Children with epilepsy, aged 1 - 18, were recruited on a consecutive basis through the child and adolescent psychiatry, pediatric and neurology-epilepsy outpatient clinics which had been invited to participate in the study. Demographic data, information concerning epilepsy such as age of onset, duration, seizure type, seizure frequency, type of therapy, seizure severity, information concerning the school such as lost school days, participation in specific school activities, school and schoolmates’ informing were recorded. In order to assess the severity of epilepsy the ‘‘Illness Severity Index’’ (ISI) was used. Children and their parents were evaluated clinically by a semi-structured questionnaire in order to detect symptoms of psychopathology and to evaluate family’s aspects such as overprotection, stigma and self-esteemed quality of life. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 13. 0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data concerning abstenteism, participation in school activities, school and schoolmates’ informing, concomitant psychopathology, overprotection, stigma and self-esteemated quality of life were characterized as dependent variables and were correlated with the characteristics of the participants. Chi-square test was used to evaluate any potential association between the dependent variables. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression models were constructed to explore the independent effect of children’s and disease characteristics on the dependent variables. In order to compare characteristics between the different cultural groups (Christians-Muslims) Student’s t-test and Mann-Whitney test were also used. In our study the whole number of the participants had missed at least one school day due to epilepsy. The great number of lost school days has been found to be related with shorter duration of the disease, greater disease severity, lower educational level, insufficient knowledge of epilepsy, greater seizure worry and overprotection. Non-participation in specific activities was found to be related with age over 12, generalized seizures, greater seizure worry, overprotection and stigma Schools have been informed of the disease in the majority of our patients (75, 8 %). Greater disease duration, lower seizure worry and better knowledge of the disease were correlated with better school informing. [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is 1 - 2 % and is thereby {{the most common}} cardiac malformation. BAV is highly associated with valvular dysfunction and aortic co nditions such as ascending aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection. Of BAV individuals, 25 - 50 % will develop indication s for surgical intervention. The underlying molecular mechanisms of BAV formation {{and the reason for}} the high {{prevalence of}} ascending aortic aneurysm in these patients are unknown. The overall aim o f this thesis was to characteris e morphological, molecular and clinical aspects of BAV disease in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery due to aortic valve and/or ascending aortic pathology. In the study population of this thesis more than 50 % of the patients ha d a BAV. BAV patients were approxim ately 10 years younger than patients with tricuspid aortic valves (TAV) at the time of surgery. P atients that had additional coronary artery disease were older than patients that did not, regardless of whether they had a BAV or a TAV. Ascending aortic aneurysm was substantially more common in BAV patients than in TAV patients while aortic ectasia was equally common regardless of valve morphology. In patients w ith ascending aortic dilatation, aortic valve stenosis was almost exclusively associated with BAV whereas aortic valve regurgitation was associated with either BAV or TAV. Study I assessed the morphology of the aortic root and ascending aorta in relation to valve morphology and BAV phenotype (n = 300). BAV patients ha d larger dimensions of the left ventricular outflow tract and annulus than TAV patients regardless of aortic morphology. The relative distribution of aortic aneurysm or ectasia was not related to BAV phenotype. Study II investigated a possible association between severity of valve pathology and morphology of the aortic root and ascending aorta (n = 500). The combination of aortic valve stenosis and ascending aortic aneurysm was common in BAV patients but was virtually non - existent in TAV patients. Increasin g severity of valve pathology was associated with smaller aortic dimensions. The distribution of valve pathology d id not differ with the various BAV phenotypes. Study III evaluated a possible correlation between ascending aortic dilatation and dilatation o f the distal aorta (n = 97). BAV patients with ascending aortic aneurysm s ha d smaller dimensions of the distal aorta than the corresponding group of TAV patients. Concomitant dilatation of the descending aorta was predominantly found in TAV patients. Study IV analysed the occurrence of matrix degrading proteases in the media of the aortic wall (n = 109). Expression of m atrix metalloproteinase 14 and 19 was associated with ascending aortic dilatation in TAV patients, but not BAV patients.
