5|$|The {{interiors}} were {{filmed in}} two specially converted aircraft hangars near Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk, which were leased for £1,500; this cost-measure resulted {{in much of}} the dialogue having to be re-recorded later, because the tin roofs of the hangars caused an echo. The exterior shots range from the Dunwich Coast (for the scene with the fisherman) to Langley Park outside London (for the scene where Stearne escapes capture). The tracking shot of the ambush after the opening credits was filmed at Black Park in southeast Buckinghamshire, a location frequently used by Hammer Film Productions. Lavenham Square (in Lavenham, Suffolk), site of the witch-burning scene, was the real Lavenham Market Square; the crew lowered TV antennas and telephone wires and Waddilove hired a cherry picker from a local utility company for £10, because the unit couldn't afford a <b>camera</b> <b>crane.</b> The countryside vistas seen in the chase scenes on horseback were shot on the Stanford Battle Area near Thetford, Norfolk— the producer, through connections with the government, was able to lease parts of the area. The church used in the film is St John The Evangelist in Rushford in Norfolk. The moat drowning and hanging scenes were filmed at Kentwell Hall, in Long Melford. The climax of the film was shot at Orford Castle, on the coast of East Anglia, which is an English Heritage property. Filming wrapped as scheduled on 13 November 1967.|$|E
25|$|On February 16, {{the band}} {{announced}} a live album from the Among the Kings tour which was filmed at {{a show in}} Glasgow, Scotland the night before. To create the DVD seventeen cameras, including five Go-Pros and a full-size <b>camera</b> <b>crane</b> were used to captured {{more than two hours}} of Anthrax footage of the show. A release date has not been specified but will be released later this year.|$|E
500|$|Shooting on {{location}} in New York City also added to Mackendrick’s anxieties. Exteriors were shot in the busiest, noisiest areas with crowds of young Tony Curtis fans occasionally breaking through police barriers. Mackendrick remembered, [...] "We started shooting in Times Square at rush hour, and we had high-powered actors and a <b>camera</b> <b>crane</b> and police help {{and all the rest}} of it, but we didn’t have any script. We knew where we were going vaguely, but that’s all".|$|E
5000|$|Dolly grip: {{operates}} the dollies and sometimes <b>camera</b> <b>cranes.</b> He {{or she is}} a first hire, like the key grip.|$|R
5000|$|The grip {{in charge}} of {{operating}} the camera dollies and <b>camera</b> <b>cranes</b> is called the dolly grip. They place, level, and move the dolly track, then push and pull the dolly, and usually a camera operator and camera assistant as riders.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the last}} few years, <b>camera</b> <b>cranes</b> have been {{miniaturized}} and costs have dropped so dramatically that most aspiring film makers have access to these tools. What was once a [...] "Hollywood" [...] effect is now available for under $400. Main producers of cranes companies include ABC-Products, Cambo, Filmotechnic, Polecam, Panther and Matthews Studio Equipment.|$|R
500|$|While {{writing the}} screenplay, Hirani and Joshi stayed {{together}} {{for more than}} four months. They developed scenes by going out for a walk and discussing the scene. They would not return home until they had created a scene that would make them laugh, or cry, or had some provocative thought. While there was a shortage of resources during the shooting of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S., the crew did not encounter a financial crisis during the filming of Lage Raho Munna Bhai, as the team managed to receive whatever was deemed necessary (including a Jimmy Jib, a specific kind of <b>camera</b> <b>crane,</b> just for a single crane shot). The film was shot on location in and around Mumbai, with Goa as a backdrop for the [...] "Aane Charaane" [...] song.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} one of {{the first}} scenes in which Maslany plays multiple characters interacting in the same shot. To construct the scene in which Sarah and Alison meet in the soccer field shed, Maslany and her stunt double Kathryn Alexandre first shot a master version of the scene using a Technodolly, a programmable <b>camera</b> <b>crane</b> that can memorise camera movements. Two versions of the scene were then re-filmed without Alexandre, with Maslany playing each of the characters. To simulate Alison placing her hand on Sarah's shoulder, a grip stand was used in the place of Sarah's shoulder for Maslany to hold when playing Alison, and to simulate Sarah slapping Alison's arm away, Maslany slapped the air when playing Sarah and reacted {{as if she had been}} hit when playing Alison. The final scene was created through digital compositing, whereby both versions of the scene—with Maslany playing both characters separately—are combined to produce a single shot. Maslany felt that, as one of her early attempts at sharing a scene with herself, she over-thought the process: [...] "I think I was trying too hard to get it right. Nobody's there when you're shooting these things, so you overcompensate." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first unit {{then shot}} {{for three days}} in Egypt at the Giza pyramid complex and Luxor. The shoot was highly secretive, but {{according}} to producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura, a crew of 150 Americans and [...] "several dozen local Egyptians" [...] ensured a [...] "remarkably smooth" [...] shoot. Bay earned the Egyptian government's approval to film at the pyramids by contacting Zahi Hawass, whom Bay said [...] "put {{his arm around me}} and said, 'Don't hurt my pyramids. A [...] <b>camera</b> <b>crane</b> was used at the location. Bay stated he found the climax of the first film to be weak, partly because it was shot across five different city blocks, making the action confusing and hard to follow. On this film, the final battle in Egypt was devised {{to make it easier to}} follow the action.|$|E
5000|$|The Panther GmbH {{is a film}} {{technical}} company {{situated in}} Oberhaching, Munich which develops and produces professional <b>camera</b> <b>cranes</b> and dollies. For the first ever electro - mechanical Camera dolly to be built,the [...] "Super Panther", Mr. Erich Fitz, {{the founder of the}} company, received the Oscar [...] "Scientific & Engineering Award". in the year 1990.|$|R
50|$|Important camera {{operator}} skills include choreographing and framing shots, {{knowledge of and}} the ability to select appropriate camera lenses, and other equipment (dollies, <b>camera</b> <b>cranes,</b> etc.) to portray dramatic scenes. The principles of dramatic story telling and film editing fundamentals are important skills as well. The {{camera operator}} is required to communicate clearly and concisely on sets where time and film budget constraints are ever present.|$|R
5000|$|Having toured {{extensively}} throughout Australia {{several times}} since 2004, Thes One and Double K wrote the song [...] "The Wiz" [...] about their travels down under. In Spring 2008, the group worked with director Matt Bird to film the video for [...] "The Wiz" [...] {{on location in}} Bondi Beach. The filming of the video involved underwater <b>cameras,</b> <b>cranes,</b> and an elaborate helicopter shot. It was the group's first official music video.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike some of {{the smaller}} {{adjustments}} though, the flying sequence required extensive preparation. Iñárritu spent three weeks with Halon Entertainment to previsualize the sequence. In New York, Lubezki then used the choreography of the previsualization to shoot background plates for the sequence, using a <b>camera</b> <b>crane</b> on a truck. When these were shot, Lubezki had mounted four GoPro cameras to the lens of the film camera to capture the light environment around him. Later, on a greenstage in Montreal, using a technique he had developed on Gravity, Lubezki lit Keaton with LED panels featuring high-dynamic-range images of the surrounding New York footage. The panels then realistically lit Keaton. Khanikian described the effect of the process, saying [...] "instead of using standard lighting on greenscreen [...] the proper red bounce from the red bricks and the same color of the sky reflected on Michael's head. It worked so well." [...] Rodeo FX then completed the final shots. The sequence was the last piece the editors inserted into the film. Mirrone commented that before the sequence was finished they [...] "had only imagined what it was going to feel like", but once it was completed [...] "it took the movie to this ecstatic level that absolutely blew me away." ...|$|E

50|$|In the U.S. and Canada, grips are {{lighting}} and rigging technicians in the filmmaking and video production industries. They constitute their own department {{on a film}} set and are directed by a key grip. Grips have two main functions. The first is {{to work closely with}} the camera department to provide camera support, especially if the camera is mounted to a dolly, crane, or in an unusual position, such as the top of a ladder. Some grips may specialize in operating camera dollies or <b>camera</b> <b>cranes.</b> The second main function of grips is to work closely with the electrical department to create lighting set-ups necessary for a shot {{under the direction of the}} director of photography.|$|R
50|$|Some shots {{require the}} camera to move. This can be done several ways, {{one of which is}} to use a <b>camera</b> <b>crane.</b> There are many types of camera cranes, most being a counterbalanced arm on a pivot, whilst others are hydraulic. Cranes can be used to lift the camera, and often the camera {{operator}} and assistant also, quickly into the air. The crane operator sets up and operates the <b>camera</b> <b>crane</b> so that the camera arrives at the right spot. This can be difficult since the camera may be a long distance from the operator.|$|E
50|$|A low {{bandwidth}} design will STOP {{a percentage of}} low frequency motions from getting to the camera and shaking the image (i.e. rocking and rolling from a boat, sway from a <b>camera</b> <b>crane).</b>|$|E

50|$|To achieve this, {{a number}} of {{components}} from hardware to software need to be combined. Software collects all of the {{6 degrees of freedom}} movement of the camera as well as metadata such as zoom, focus, iris and shutter elements from many different types of hardware devices, ranging from motion capture systems such as active LED marker based system from PhaseSpace, passive systems such as Motion Analysis or Vicon, to rotary encoders fitted to <b>camera</b> <b>cranes</b> and dollies such as Technocranes and Fisher Dollies, or inertia & gyroscopic sensors mounted directly to the camera. There are also laser based tracking systems that can be attached to anything, including Steadicams, to track cameras outside in the rain at distances of up to 30 meters.|$|R
5000|$|The key grip is {{the head}} grip. Grips affect shadow effects with lights, and {{occasionally}} maneuver <b>camera</b> <b>cranes,</b> dollies, and platforms under direction from the Cinematographer. The term grip is used in slightly different ways in American and British or Australian film making. In the British and Australian film industries, a grip mounts and supports cameras, which can include anything beyond a basic tripod. Lighting in British and Australian film-making is headed by the gaffer, who {{is also part of}} the camera department. Grips can also be the people that do the laborious work on sets. These type of grips push, pull, roll, and lift various pieces of equipment under direction from a television director, television producer, or set designer.|$|R
5000|$|When [...] "talking pictures" [...] were innovated in 1928, DeMille made a {{successful}} transition, offering his own innovations to the painful process; he devised a microphone boom and a soundproof camera blimp. He also popularized the <b>camera</b> <b>crane.</b>|$|E
50|$|Director Fejos {{designed}} the <b>camera</b> <b>crane</b> specifically {{for use on}} this movie, allowing unusually fluid movement and access to nearly every conceivable angle. It could travel at 600 feet per minute and enlivened the visual style of this film and others that followed.|$|E
50|$|During filming, Jovovich's stunt double, British stuntwoman Olivia Jackson, was {{severely}} injured when her motorcycle {{collided with a}} <b>camera</b> <b>crane,</b> leaving her in a medically-induced coma for two weeks. She had been riding at high speed without a helmet, leading to the accident ripping off half her face, and crushing her facial bones. Among Jackson's injuries were cerebral trauma, a crushed face, a severed artery in her neck, a paralyzed arm, several broken ribs, a shattered scapula, a broken clavicle, torn fingers with a thumb {{that needed to be}} amputated, and five nerves torn out of her spinal cord. The <b>camera</b> <b>crane</b> had malfunctioned and failed {{to move out of the}} way. Jackson announced in December 2015 that her paralyzed left arm will need to be amputated. Her arm was amputated above the elbow.|$|E
50|$|In filmmaking {{and video}} production, a crane shot is a shot {{taken by a}} camera on a moving crane or jib. Most cranes {{accommodate}} both the camera and an operator, but some can be moved by remote control. <b>Camera</b> <b>cranes</b> {{go back to the}} dawn of movie-making, and were frequently used in silent films to enhance the epic nature of large sets and massive crowds. Another use is to move up and away from the actors, a common way of ending a movie. Crane shots are often found in what are supposed to be emotional or suspenseful scenes. One example of this technique is the shots taken by remote cranes in the car-chase sequence of the 1985 film To Live and Die in L.A.. Some filmmakers place the camera on a boom arm simply {{to make it easier to}} move around between ordinary set-ups.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, Ufa {{had been}} {{acquired}} by the right-wing press magnate Alfred Hugenberg, and in July 1927, he sent Ufa's new CEO Ludwig Klitzsch to America to bring Pommer back to Germany. From the USA, Pommer brought organizational and technical innovations, {{such as the use}} of shooting schedules and <b>camera</b> <b>crane</b> cars.|$|E
50|$|A high {{bandwidth}} system will STOP {{low and high}} frequency, or a large range of base motion, from getting to the camera (i.e. the vibration of a helicopter, the rapid shakes and bumps from a camera car, {{as well as the}} rocking and rolling of a boat and sway of a <b>camera</b> <b>crane).</b>|$|E
50|$|Skilled {{like his}} father in {{woodwork}} and metal craft, he often developed special tools for film making, including a <b>camera</b> <b>crane</b> system.

500|$|Fourteen {{cameras were}} used to film the Palio di Siena footage, which was later edited into the main sequence. Aerial shots using {{helicopters}} were banned, and the crew were also forbidden from showing any violence [...] "involving either people or animals." [...] To shoot the foot chase in Siena in April 2008 four <b>camera</b> <b>cranes</b> {{were built in the}} town, and a cable camera was also used. Framestore worked on the Siena chase, duplicating the 1,000 extras during principal photography to match shots of the 40,000 strong audience at the real Palio, removing wires that held Craig and the stuntmen in the rooftop segment of the chase, and digital expansion of the floor and skylight in the art gallery Bond and Mitchell fall into. The art gallery fight was intended to be simple, but during filming Craig's stunt double accidentally fell from the construction scaffolding. Forster preferred the idea of Bond hanging from ropes reaching for his gun to kill Mitchell, rather than having both men run out of the building to continue their chase as specified in the script, and the number of effects shots increased.|$|R
