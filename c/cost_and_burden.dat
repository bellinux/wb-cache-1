5000|$|As stated above, {{individuals}} with HDHPs often forgo or delay care {{due to increased}} cost sharing, and this often leads to patients presenting to health care providers and institutions later on in much worse condition. This pattern has {{a significant effect on}} the supply side of health care. Hospitals and health care institutions take on increasing amounts of bad debt with the advent of HDHP as patients exhaust their unaffordable deductibles soon after being admitted for care and default on outstanding balances. With rise in cost sharing, hospitals are collecting more money directly from the patients, from 2011 to 2014, the number of consumer payments to health care providers increased 193 percent {{according to a study by}} to the [...] "Trends in Healthcare Payments Fifth Annual Report: 2014" [...] from InstaMed. From a physician/hospital supply, HDHP have forced institutions to become more consumer conscious as patients (due to price shopping) do their own research and understand their options. If patients with HDHPs forgo primary care, this lessens the volume and revenue they are able to generate. It also means that, later on, the burden and intensity of care per episode is much greater. The same goes for specialists as well who see less patients undergoing preventative screening and maintenance care (colonoscopies, mammograms, routine laboratory testing, etc.) and then end up with serious (and preventable) conditions.  In the long term, the <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> <b>burden</b> is invariably greater. Physicians struggle with having cost become a greater reason for opting for or against a medical interaction or procedure than the health benefits for the individual.|$|E

40|$|Against the {{background}} of the hotly debated issue of Germany's attractiveness as a business location, the article assess whether, and to what extent, the increased propensity of German companies to invest abroad indicates an exodus of German industry and has negative effects on domestic jobs. The paper reviews the German Direct Foreign Investment (DFI) position in the 1990 s; compares it to those in other major industrialized countries, carries out a comparative evaluation of the <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> <b>burden</b> factors at the German location; examines the reasons underlying the DFI decisions of German manufacturing companies and the subsequent types of investment; and finally assesses their effects on domestic investment and employment. The article ascertains that, in spite of the relatively unfavorable comparison of important <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> <b>burden</b> location factors, there are few grounds on which to connect the substantial increase in outward DFI in the 1990 s to an exodus of German industry. The assessment supports the assertion that the net effect on domestic investment and German jobs has been positive. ...|$|E

In this global development era, global companies can choose the region in which they initiate clinical development and submit NDAs first, after assessing the likelihood of success, costs, and future profits. Preceding drug development experience in one region will contribute to subsequent development in other regions. In addition to global development pathways, domestic development experience with regard to similar drugs seems to affect the design and conduct of clinical trials, through the experience of companies as well as investigators and institutions. However, previous studies have not sufficiently investigated such aspects of experience.|$|E
