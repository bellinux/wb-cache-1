40|$|In naming his satirical {{version of}} a <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> company The Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and <b>Life</b> <b>Assurance</b> Company Dickens was aiming at an already {{well-established}} tendency for <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> companies to stress in their promotional enterprises the altruistic character of their business. So disinterested was the Anglo-Bengalee that 'nobody can run any risk by the transaction except the office, which, in its great liberality is pretty sure to lose' (1994 : 419). While few <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> companies would have pushed the claim that far it is certainly {{the case that the}} idea of 'disinterestedness' played a peculiar role in the nineteenth century <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> industry. This paper explores how <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> companies sought to overcome concerns about the safety and propriety of their business by promulgating particular ideas about <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> as a pious, self-ï¿½disinterested' form of conduct. Throughout the nineteenth century <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> operated as an exemplary technique of liberal government by offering a means of market-based self-rule that depended heavily on an emergent form of knowledge which blended together impartiality, self-interest and disinterestedness (Poovey, 1998) ...|$|R

40|$|We analyse the {{mortality}} of couples by fitting a multiple state model {{to a large}} insurance data set. We find evidence that mortality rates increase {{after the death of}} a partner and, in addition, that this phenomenon diminishes over time. This is popularly known as a “broken-heart” effect and we find that it affects widowers more than widows. Remaining lifetimes of joint lives therefore exhibit short-term dependence. We carry out numerical work involving the pricing and valuation of typical <b>contingent</b> <b>assurance</b> contracts and of a joint life and survivor annuity. If insurers ignore dependence, or mis-specify it as long-term dependence, then significant mis-pricing and inappropriate provisioning can result. Detailed numerical results are presented...|$|R

40|$|Life Insurance {{contract}} is that under which one party pays a certain {{sum of money}} referred to as premium to another party in return on the happening of specified contingency (ices). These contingencies include: deaths, maturity, surrender lapsed and paid-up. These however, operate simultaneously as mutually exclusive events that impinge negatively on the <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> portfolio. Most <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> policyholders complain of the adverse effect of inflation on the policy values {{at the time of}} payment on the happening of the contingencies. This has resulted in a high rate of lapse, surrender and conversion to paid-up status. This study therefore, investigates the effects of these multiple decrements on <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> portfolios, which resulted in the hypothesis propounded and tested in this research. Based on the findings, the study recommends that life insurance companies should enlighten the public more on the benefits of <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> and evolve some incentives so as to avoid the negative impact of these modes of decrement on <b>life</b> <b>assurance</b> portfolios. </p...|$|R
