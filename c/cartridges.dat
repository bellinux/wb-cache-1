5|$|Forensic firearm {{examination}} is {{the forensic}} process of examining {{the characteristics of}} firearms {{as well as any}} <b>cartridges</b> or bullets left behind at a crime scene. Specialists in this field are tasked with linking bullets and <b>cartridges</b> to weapons and weapons to individuals. Obliterated serial numbers can be raised and recorded in an attempt to find the registered owner of the weapon. Examiners can also look for fingerprints on the weapon and <b>cartridges,</b> and then viable prints can be processed through fingerprint databases for a potential match.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{recovered}} materials, {{a fraction}} {{has been given}} to the New Mexico Museum of Space History for display, and another 100 to the documentary producers Lightbox and Fuel Entertainment. Galea believes the remaining <b>cartridges</b> can be sold by the city of Alamogordo through the Museum of Space History. She hopes that the sale of these games can help fund recognition of the burial site as a tourist attraction in the future. The City of Alamogordo approved the auction of the games in September 2014, to be sold through eBay and the Alamogordo Council website. As of September 2015, over $107,000 has been raised through the sales of about 880 unearthed <b>cartridges,</b> with one E.T. copy selling for more than $1,500. About 300 <b>cartridges</b> remain to be sold at a later date given the historical value of the <b>cartridges.</b>|$|E

5|$|Reports from 1983 {{gave way}} to urban legend stating {{that as a result}} of {{overproduction}} and returns, millions of unsold <b>cartridges</b> were buried in an Alamogordo, New Mexico landfill. In 2013, plans were revealed to conduct an excavation to determine the accuracy of reports about the burial, and in April of the following year, the diggers confirmed that the Alamogordo burial did include E.T. <b>cartridges</b> among other titles. James Heller, the former Atari manager who was in charge of the original burial, was also on hand at the excavation and revealed to the Associated Press that 728,000 <b>cartridges</b> of various titles were buried.|$|E

5|$|In a 1979 {{interview}} in The Videophile newsletter, Muntz revealed {{the biggest problem}} for the Stereo-Pak business was returned merchandise. He explained that when reproducing the work of major artists like The Beatles, the Stereo-Pak plant had to make {{hundreds of thousands of}} <b>cartridges.</b> But once a popular album became less popular, retailers would return the unsold <b>cartridges,</b> expecting credit towards new titles. Muntz was unprepared for the returns and said the huge cost of unsold merchandise eventually made his Stereo-Pak business unprofitable.|$|E

5|$|Lucasfilm Games re-submitted the edited {{version of}} Maniac Mansion to Nintendo, which then {{manufactured}} 250,000 <b>cartridges.</b> Each cartridge was {{fitted with a}} battery-powered back-up to save data. Nintendo announced the port through its official magazine in early 1990, and it provided further coverage later that year. The ability to microwave a hamster remained in the game, which Crockford cited {{as an example of}} the censors' contradictory criteria. However, Nintendo later noticed it, and after the first batch of <b>cartridges</b> was sold, Jaleco was forced to remove the content from future shipments.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{most other}} self-extracting revolvers (such as the Webley service revolvers or the Smith & Wesson No. 3 Revolver), the Enfield Mk I/Mk II was {{complicated}} to unload, having an Owen Jones selective extraction/ejection system {{which was supposed}} to allow the firer to eject spent <b>cartridges,</b> whilst retaining live rounds in the cylinder. The Enfield Mk I/Mk II had a hinged frame, and when the barrel was unlatched, the cylinder would move forward, operating the extraction system and allowing the spent <b>cartridges</b> to simply fall out. The idea was that the cylinder moved forward far enough to permit fired cases to be completely extracted (and ejected by gravity), but not far enough to permit live <b>cartridges</b> (i.e., those with projectiles still present, and thus longer in overall length) from being removed in the same manner.|$|E
40|$|The {{function}} of <b>cartridge</b> filter is to separate substance or particle from liquid. <b>Cartridge</b> filter is a media to filtrate substance that flow with liquid. <b>Cartridge</b> filter {{in this project}} focus for water filtration system that usually used at houses and small scale industry. Volume flow rate relate with pressure of the water that flow through pipe system. <b>Cartridge</b> filter function as a media that reduced pressure from the water flow and call pressure drop. Sediment sand particles function as particles that flow with the water and will filtrate with <b>cartridge</b> filter. Sediment sand make contact {{on the surface of}} <b>cartridge</b> filter depend on the volume flow rate of water. <b>Cartridge</b> will clogged because of sediment sand clog on the surface of <b>cartridge</b> filter when tried to enter the <b>cartridge</b> filter. This situation make filtration system has different pressure on the entrance and the exit of <b>cartridge</b> housing. Different pressure call pressure drop represent the pressure drop of the <b>cartridge.</b> From the pressure drop can relate with volume flow rate and determined life span and maximum condition of the <b>cartridge</b> filter. Maximum clogging condition happen because of pressure of <b>cartridge</b> filter does not increase anymore and <b>cartridge</b> filter has fully clogged with sediment sand...|$|R
50|$|The <b>cartridge</b> maximum {{overall length}} is {{nominally}} given as 2.230 in, however, as the <b>cartridge</b> is a wildcat <b>cartridge</b> chamber dimensions may vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. For this reason overall length of the <b>cartridge</b> may vary.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]416 Remington Magnum is a [...]416 caliber (10.6 mm) of a belted bottle-necked design. The <b>cartridge</b> was {{intended}} as a dangerous game hunting <b>cartridge</b> and released to the public in 1989. The <b>cartridge</b> uses the case of the 8 mm Remington Magnum as a parent <b>cartridge.</b> When the <b>cartridge</b> was released in 1988, author Frank C. Barnes considered the [...]416 Remington Magnum to be the [...] "most outstanding factory <b>cartridge</b> introduced in decades".|$|R
5|$|Although the Interface 2 proved popular, {{the high}} cost of ROM <b>cartridges,</b> {{and the fact that they}} were limited to 16K in size, meant that very few titles were {{released}} in this format.|$|E
5|$|Blank pistol <b>cartridges</b> {{carrying}} CS in {{powder form}} have been released to the public. These, when fired at relatively close ranges, fully expose the target {{to the effects of}} CS, and are employed as a potent defensive weapon in regions where blank firing pistols are legally permitted for such use.|$|E
5|$|Muntz {{attempted}} {{to establish a}} modern, trendy image for his players and <b>cartridges.</b> His print advertisements often showed the player installed in an appealing sports car and usually incorporated a young, attractive model with a suggestive tagline.

5|$|Nonetheless, the Labrador Battery guns {{had limited}} effect {{during the battle}} and the rounds {{allocated}} to it were more armour-piercing <b>cartridges</b> rather than high explosive rounds which were more effective against the infantry. As a result, these guns were ineffective and saw little action during the Battle of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Rohrer {{launched}} the Kickstarter campaign on May 9, 2012, looking to raise $78,715; the campaign closed on May 26, 2012, after raising $90,118 from 1,305 backers. This allowed manufacturing to proceed, and Diamond Trust of London {{became the first}} successfully crowdfunded Nintendo DS game. By mid-July, the 6,000 <b>cartridges</b> had been manufactured by Nintendo in Japan, and in August, they arrived at Rohrer's home in California. As he was packaging the <b>cartridges</b> personally, it allowed him to release a special signed and numbered limited edition of 1000 copies, bundled with mystery bonuses. The game was released on August 28, 2012, and as customers received their copies, they revealed {{the contents of the}} limited edition. Jason Cipriano at MTV Multiplayer received, alongside his limited edition, postage stamps and a coin from countries featured in the game, and four actual diamonds.|$|E

50|$|The Feederle {{brothers}} (Fidel, Friedrich, and Josef) {{used the}} Borchardt <b>cartridge</b> in their {{design for the}} Mauser C96 pistol. The Borchardt <b>cartridge</b> thus {{was the basis for}} the 7.63×25mm Mauser <b>cartridge,</b> which used the same dimensions but was eventually loaded with a stronger powder charge. By extension, the Borchardt <b>cartridge</b> was also the basis for the 7.62×25mm Tokarev <b>cartridge,</b> which was developed directly from the Mauser round using an even stronger powder charge than the Mauser <b>cartridge.</b>|$|R

5|$|The M249 is a belt-fed {{light machine}} gun. It fires the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge, usually a {{combination}} of one M856 tracer and four M855 ball <b>cartridges</b> fed from M27 linked belts. Belts are typically held in a hard plastic or soft canvas box attached to {{the underside of the}} weapon.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo 64 {{video game}} console has {{a library of}} games, which were {{primarily}} released in plastic ROM <b>cartridges.</b> Two small indentations {{on the back of}} each cartridge allows it to connect or pass through the system's cartridge dustcover flaps. All regions have the same connectors, and region-locked <b>cartridges</b> will fit into the other regions' systems by using a cartridge converter or by simply removing the cartridge's casing. However, the systems are also equipped with lockout chips that will only allow them to play their appropriate games. Both Japanese and North American systems have the same NTSC lockout, while Europe has a PAL lockout. A bypass device such as the N64 Passport or the Datel Action Replay can be used to play import titles, but a few games require an additional boot code before they can be played.|$|E
5|$|The guns {{mounted in}} the open battery were lighter {{than those in the}} casemates and were not {{enclosed}} but traversed on rails in the open air.
