In reality, since hafnium occurs with zirconium, hafnium <b>can</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> a byproduct of zirconium extraction {{to the extent that}} the low demand requires.|$|E
5|$|Two smaller low-gain antennas {{are also}} present for lower-rate {{communication}} during emergencies and special events, such as launch and Mars Orbit Insertion. These antennas {{do not have}} focusing dishes and can transmit and receive from any direction. They are an important backup system to ensure that MRO <b>can</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> reached, even if its main antenna is pointed away from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|A {{reversible}} {{cellular automaton}} is a cellular automaton {{in which every}} configuration has a unique predecessor. That is, it is a regular grid of cells, each containing a state drawn from a finite set of states, with a rule for updating all cells simultaneously based on the states of their neighbors, such that the previous state of any cell before an update can be determined uniquely from the updated states of all the cells. The time-reversed dynamics of a reversible cellular automaton <b>can</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> described by another cellular automaton rule, possibly on a much larger neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{resonators}} in the expression {{corresponds to the}} number of passbands required. Lowpass and highpass filters can be viewed as special cases of the resonator expression with {{one or the other of}} the terms becoming zero as appropriate. Bandstop filters can be regarded as a combination of a lowpass and a highpass filter. Multiple bandstop filters <b>can</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> expressed in terms of a multiple bandpass filter. In this way it, can be seen that this transformation represents the general case for any bandform, and all the other transformations are to be viewed as special cases of it.|$|E
5|$|Although 0 is {{divisible}} by 2 {{more times}} than any other number, it is not straightforward to quantify exactly how many times that is. For any nonzero integer n, one may define the 2-adic order of n to be {{the number of times}} n is divisible by 2. This description does not work for 0; {{no matter how many times}} it is divided by 2, it <b>can</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> divided by 2 again. Rather, the usual convention is to set the 2-order of 0 to be infinity as a special case. This convention is not peculiar to the 2-order; it is one of the axioms of an additive valuation in higher algebra.|$|E
5|$|Another {{very common}} {{component}} of distributed element filters is the stub. Over {{a narrow range}} of frequencies, a stub {{can be used as}} a capacitor or an inductor (its impedance is determined by its length) but over a wide band it behaves as a resonator. Short-circuit, nominally quarter-wavelength stubs (figure 3(a)) behave as shunt LC antiresonators, and an open-circuit nominally quarter-wavelength stub (figure 3(b)) behaves as a series LC resonator. Stubs can also be used in conjunction with impedance transformers to build more complex filters and, as would be expected from their resonant nature, are most useful in band-pass applications. While open-circuit stubs are easier to manufacture in planar technologies, they have the drawback that the termination deviates significantly from an ideal open circuit (see figure 4(b)), often leading to a preference for short-circuit stubs (one <b>can</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> used in place of the other by adding or subtracting λ/4 to or from the length).|$|E

5|$|Russell replaces Mill's {{analysis}} with {{an examination of}} the issue from four perspectives: the perspective of the governor, the citizen, the innovator, and the philosopher. The rational governor is always threatened by revolutionary activities, and <b>can</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> expected to ban speech which calls for assassination. Yet the governor would be advised to allow freedom of speech to prevent and diminish discontent among the subjects, and has no reason to suppress ideas which are unrelated to his governance, for instance the Copernican doctrine of heliocentrism. Relatedly, the citizen mainly understands free speech {{as an extension of the}} right to do peaceably that which could only otherwise be done through violence (Russell 1938:179–182).|$|E
5|$|There exist data {{structures}} that may improve on binary search {{in some cases}} for both searching and other operations available for sorted arrays. For example, searches, approximate matches, and the operations available to sorted arrays can be performed more efficiently than binary search on specialized data structures such as van Emde Boas trees, fusion trees, tries, and bit arrays. However, while these operations <b>can</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> done at least efficiently on a sorted array regardless of the keys, such data structures are usually only faster because they exploit the properties of keys with a certain attribute (usually keys that are small integers), and thus will be time or space consuming for keys that lack that attribute. Some structures, such as Judy arrays, {{use a combination of}} approaches to mitigate this while retaining efficiency and the ability to perform approximate matching.|$|E
