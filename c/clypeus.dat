5|$|All true {{caterpillars}} have an upside-down Y-shaped {{line that}} runs {{from the top of}} the head downward. In between the Y-shaped line lies the frontal triangle or frons. The <b>clypeus,</b> located below the frons, lies between the two antennae. The labrum is found below the <b>clypeus.</b> There is a small notch in the centre of the labrum with which the leaf edge engages when the caterpillar eats.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{distinguishing}} structural features {{have been}} found to separate the workers and queens, the male is easily identified by its bulging eyes, subquadrate <b>clypeus,</b> and slender antennae. P. exclamans males are also more variable in external morphology compared to females. This is possible given the male’s hemizygosity (females are homozygous).|$|E
5|$|Diatom species {{identified}} in sediments left by Lake Cahuilla include Cocconeis placentula, Epithermia argus, Epithermia turgida, Mastogloia elliptica, Navicula palpebralis, Pinnularia viridis, Rhopalodia gibba, Surirella striatula, Terpsinoei musica and Tetracyclus lacustris. Other species whose identification {{is less clear}} are Campylodiscus <b>clypeus,</b> Cyclotella kuetzingiana, Hantzschia taenia, Navicula clementis, Navicula ergadensis, Nitzschia etchegoinia, Nitzschia granulata and Synedra ulna.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} what the {{function}} of the oral setae in extant species is, other than the long sensory hairs seen in some genera such as Anochetus and Odontomachus. In Zigrasimecia, the similar structures most likely did not act as trigger-hairs because they are stout and shorter. Instead, they were probably used for mechanical interactions with their food. The setae may have allowed the manipulation of liquid food, and the unification of the mandibles with other body parts such as the <b>clypeus</b> and labral indicates that they served as a trap for potential arthropod prey, particularly mites and small flies. Zigrasimecia was possibly a generalist predator.|$|E
5|$|The {{cephalothorax}} of Z.sexpunctatus is {{bronze to}} black in color. Like all Zygoballus spiders, the cephalothorax is box-like in shape, being widest at the posterior lateral eyes. Numerous white or pale blue scales cover the <b>clypeus</b> ("face") and chelicerae. This covering extends around {{the sides of}} the carapace, ending beyond the posterior median eyes. In males, the labium is two-fifths as long as the maxillae, and as wide as it is long. The chelicerae of males are greatly enlarged and obliquely oriented, with each chelicera having a prominent inner tooth and a long, curved fang.|$|E
5|$|The colour of {{the head}} and gaster are black, shading into reddish brown on the <b>clypeus</b> and around the frontal carinae. The mesosoma (alitrunk), node, and legs are brownish-red and light, with the legs {{becoming}} yellowish in certain areas. The antennae and mandibles are brownish yellow, and the teeth have black edges. Overall, M. inquilina can be distinguished from others by its black head and its almost hairless body. Its colour is similar to M. nigriceps, but M. nigriceps is larger and covered in hair, along with a head more rounded than other species. M. inquilina does not have a worker caste, making it a workerless parasite.|$|E
5|$|Most {{worker and}} soldier {{termites}} are completely blind {{as they do}} not have a pair of eyes. However, some species, such as Hodotermes mossambicus, have compound eyes which they use for orientation and to distinguish sunlight from moonlight. The alates have eyes along with lateral ocelli. Lateral ocelli, however, are not found in all termites. Like other insects, termites have a small tongue-shaped labrum and a clypeus; the <b>clypeus</b> is divided into a postclypeus and anteclypeus. Termite antennae have a number of functions such as the sensing of touch, taste, odours (including pheromones), heat and vibration. The three basic segments of a termite antenna include a scape, a pedicel (typically shorter than the scape), and the flagellum (all segments beyond the scape and pedicel). The mouth parts contain a maxillae, a labium, and a set of mandibles. The maxillae and labium have palps that help termites sense food and handling.|$|E
5|$|After hatching, the nymphs {{fall from}} the {{branches}} to seek {{a crack in the}} soil where they can burrow, often to a depth of 10–40cm (4–16in), by digging with their large forelegs. Larger species of cicada like A.curvicosta are thought to spend 2–8 years underground, during which time they grow and feed through their rostrum on the sap from tree roots. They moult five times before emerging from the ground to shed their final shell. Although consistently taking place at night, the emergence of the population is diffusely spread over the season in comparison to the more high-density Australian species. The sex ratio is about 1.15males to every female, consistent throughout the emergence. The metabolic rate over a period of about 6.5hours during emergence of A.curvicosta is about 1.8times the resting metabolic rate of the adult. A South East Queensland study reported nymphs would emerge on most tree species but avoid Norfolk pine (Araucaria heterophylla) and broad-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca quinquenervia). The adults are usually found between November and May but are sometimes observed as early as September and until as late as June. They were recorded as appearing every year, mainly in December and January in western Sydney, with a similar 92-day emergence period from late November until late February recorded in South East Queensland. This makes it one of the last Australian cicadas to emerge each season. The nymph grips onto the tree bark with all of its legs, swallows air and redistributes haemolymph to split the cast down the center of its back. It then extracts its head and <b>clypeus</b> by hunching its body, and when these have emerged, arches back to draw the legs out of their casing. It then slowly unfolds its wings, finally bending forward and gripping onto the front of the shell to free its abdomen. Once free it hangs for hours more as the wings harden.|$|E
25|$|The <b>clypeus</b> is a {{sclerite}} {{between the}} face and labrum, which is dorsally separated from the frons by the frontoclypeal suture in primitive insects. The clypeogenal suture laterally demarcates the <b>clypeus,</b> with the <b>clypeus</b> ventrally separated from the labrum by the clypeolabral suture. The <b>clypeus</b> differs in shape and size, such as species of Lepidoptera with a large <b>clypeus</b> with elongated mouthparts. The cheek or gena forms the sclerotized area {{on each side of}} the head below the compound eyes extending to the gular suture. Like many of the other parts making up the insect's head, the gena varies among species, with its boundaries difficult to establish. For example, in dragonflies and damselflies, it is between the compound eyes, <b>clypeus,</b> and mouthparts. The postgena is the area immediately posteriad, or posterior or lower on the gena of pterygote insects, and forms the lateral and ventral parts of the occipital arch. The occipital arch is a narrow band forming the posterior edge of the head capsule arching dorsally over the foramen. The subgenal area is usually narrow, located above the mouthparts; this area also includes the hypostoma and pleurostoma. The vertex extends anteriorly above the bases of the antennae as a prominent, pointed, concave rostrum. The posterior wall of the head capsule is penetrated by a large aperture, the foramen. Through it pass the organ systems, such as nerve cord, esophagus, salivary ducts, and musculature, connecting the head with the thorax.|$|E
25|$|Ef. surinamensis are {{characterized}} by their long tongue and yellow hindtibial posterior fringe. The forehead and thorax are black with a colorful, metallic face; the labrum is also rounded. One can distinguish between the two sexes {{by looking at the}} ridges on the <b>clypeus.</b> Males have three, while females only have one. Also, a female's <b>clypeus</b> is not depressed at the tentorial pits. Males are approximately 16–19mm in length, with a tongue of about 13–14mm long. Ef. surinamensis can be distinguished from other Euglossine species by the knob above their hindtibial spurs and by the darkened medial cell in their wings.|$|E
25|$|Similar to the {{abdominal}} spots that imply strong fighting fitness and mating success in male P. dominula, the salient {{patterns on the}} female's <b>clypeus</b> demonstrate strong correlation to its dominance and is used to facilitate rival assessments.|$|E
25|$|The mandibles of O. bauri {{are kept}} in place with a latch called the <b>clypeus.</b> Once the latch is {{released}}, all of the energy stored is quickly released and the mandibles close, very similar to a crossbow when fired.|$|E
25|$|The Black hover wasp is {{characterized}} by their brown-black coloration. Similar to other species in the Stenogastrinae subfamily, P. alternata can be distinguished by their significantly narrow mandibles. Another descriptor is the long, pointed <b>clypeus</b> separate from the eye shared by Parischnogaster striatula.|$|E
25|$|Camponotus anderseni {{is light}} brown and glossy. Like any arthropod, its body {{contains}} three sections. The first part {{is called the}} prosoma while the middle part is called the mesosoma, and the posterior part is called the metasoma. The dorsum, or posterior side, of the mesosoma on Camponotus anderseni is flattened. It also has distinct metanotum on the posterior of the thorax. It is lacking erect setae under its head, and its body is slightly raised on the tibiae, or fourth joint of each leg. Its eyes elongate looking outward, nearer to the mandibles than the vertex. It is dimorphic, meaning there are two separate forms based on class. In major workers, the <b>clypeus</b> is depressed and finely punctate. The anterior margin is convex. In minor workers, the <b>clypeus</b> is wide, and the anterior margin is convex and projecting.|$|E
25|$|In {{the past}} such a toponym, {{indicating}} {{the presence of}} dwarf fan palms on the spot, was recorded in some written documents. The theologian and writer Salvatore Vidal, speaking of the Sinis peninsula in his <b>Clypeus</b> Aureus excellentiae calaritanae (1641), reports the toponym Montigu de Prama. The Franciscan friar Antonio Felice Mattei, who wrote in the 18th century a historiography of Sardinian dioceses and bishops, mentions Montigu Palma {{as one of the}} localities within the Sinis peninsula.|$|E
25|$|The {{adult males}} look {{very similar to}} the females. They have about the same body length, and the main {{differences}} include their antennae being completely dark brown, and having hair on the broad yellow plate (<b>clypeus)</b> at the front of their heads. They have more hair in other places as well. Also, their upper hind limbs (femoras) on their median legs are brown with a thin, long, yellow stripe. Lastly, the aedeagus (reproductive organ which is used to secrete sperm) is flattened and inflated at the apex.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{the alpha}} female dominates all other {{individuals}} of a colony, laying {{the majority of}} eggs and partaking in differential oophagy. The alpha female devotes {{much of her time}} to social interaction, in comparison to subordinates that are much more involved in foraging and brood care. The <b>clypeus,</b> the yellow region above the mouth, is extremely variable in number, size, and shape of black spots, and this variation correlates to dominance; more dominant individuals have more black spots. The arrival at the nest correlates with the dominance hierarchy. Therefore, individuals that join the nest later are seldom dominant.|$|E
25|$|The insect {{mouthparts}} {{consist of}} the maxilla, labium, {{and in some}} species, the mandibles. The labrum is a simple, fused sclerite, often called the upper lip, and moves longitudinally, which is hinged to the <b>clypeus.</b> The mandibles (jaws) are a highly sclerotized pair of structures that move {{at right angles to}} the body, used for biting, chewing, and severing food. The maxillae are paired structures that can also move at right angles to the body and possess segmented palps. The labium (lower lip) is the fused structure that moves longitudinally and possesses a pair of segmented palps.|$|E
25|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to find conspicuous variations amongst individuals with bare eyes, definite features are unique to each individual. For example, the abdominal spots on males of P. dominula vary in sizes, locations, and patterns. They act as sexually selective signals and also are used to determine social hierarchy within the colonies. Males with smaller, regular patterns of spots were more aggressive and dominant over those that had larger, irregular patterns. Similarly, morphology of females also varies between individuals. The larger and the more scattered the <b>clypeus</b> marks on the foundress are, the higher the chance for her to be dominant over other females.|$|E
25|$|Parischnogaster alternata was {{originally}} named by Shoichi Francisco Sakagami in 1969. P. alternata {{is one of}} ten species in the genus Parischnogaster. In current literature, P. alternata has been classified as potentially synonymous with another species, Parischnogaster timida discovered by Williams in 1928. These two synonymies may result in future renaming of the species. The closest relative is Parischnogaster striatula. In a phylogenetic classification study, P. striatula was misclassified for P. alternata suggesting close genetic relatedness. These two species are both {{a part of the}} striatula-group due to shared descriptive characteristics such as the length and width of the petiole and the separation of the <b>clypeus</b> from the eye.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} females (queens) are {{the principal}} egg layers, while the subordinate females ("auxiliaries") primarily forage and do not lay eggs. This hierarchy is not permanent, though; when the queen (alpha-female) {{is removed from the}} nest, the second-most dominant female (beta-female) displaces the role of the previous queen. Dominance in females is determined by the severity of the scatteredness in the coloration of the <b>clypeus</b> (face), whereas dominance in males is shown by the variation of spots of their abdomens. P. dominula is far from being extinct or even being in danger due to their exceptional survival features such as productive colony cycle, short development time, and higher ability to endure predator attacks.|$|E
25|$|V. mandarinia is {{a species}} in the genus Vespa, which {{comprises}} all true hornets. Along with seven other species, V. mandarinia {{is a part of}} the V. tropica species group, defined by the single notch located on the apical margin of the seventh gastral sternum of the male. The most closely related species within the species group is V. soror. The triangular shape of the apical margin of the <b>clypeus</b> of the female is diagnostic, the vertex of both species is enlarged, and the shape of the apex of the aedeagus is distinct and similar. Division of the genus into subgenera has been attempted in the past,) but has been abandoned, due to the anatomical similarity amongst species and because behavioural similarity is not associated with phylogeny.|$|E
25|$|The frons is {{that part}} of the head capsule that lies ventrad or anteriad of the vertex. The frons varies in size {{relative}} to the insect, and in many species the definition of its borders is arbitrary, even in some insect taxa that have well-defined head capsules. In most species, though, the frons is bordered at its anterior by the frontoclypeal or epistomal sulcus above the <b>clypeus.</b> Laterally it is limited by the fronto-genal sulcus, if present, and the boundary with the vertex, by the ecdysial cleavage line, if it is visible. If there is a median ocellus, it generally is on the frons, though in some insects such as many Hymenoptera, all three ocelli appear on the vertex. A more formal definition is that it is the sclerite from which the pharyngeal dilator muscles arise, but in many contexts that too, is not helpful. In the anatomy of some taxa, such as many Cicadomorpha, the front of the head is fairly clearly distinguished and tends to be broad and sub-vertical; that median area commonly is taken to be the frons.|$|E
25|$|L. vechti {{frequently}} request trophallaxis {{from other}} members within their colonies. This behavior is most exhibited whenever a forager {{returns to the}} colony. A fellow colony member may solicit food from the individual {{in a variety of}} ways. The solicitor may approach the forager and bite her on her <b>clypeus</b> or her mouthparts. The two wasps may also push their heads against each other as if they are fighting. While this happens, they either do not move their antennae or hold them quivering to one side, and their abdomens are pointed downwards slightly. A wasp might also solicit food by rubbing the sides of the other individual's head with her front legs and flapping her wings vigorously. Trophallaxis usually happens too quickly to be observed, and a forager will often leave the nest a few seconds after arriving because she is often rushed by many wasps at the same time. Foragers also often return with insects (such as ants or termites) which they have chewed up and feed to the larvae.|$|E
25|$|The {{sculpture}} is {{very similar}} to S. richteri. The punctures are from where pilosity arises, and these are often elongated on the dorsal and ventral portions of the head. On the thorax, striae are present, but they are less engraved with fewer punctures than in S. richteri. On the petiole, the punctates are located on the sides. The postpetiole, when viewed above, has a strong shagreen with distinct transverse punctostriae. The sides are covered in deep punctures, where they appear smaller but deeper. In S. richteri, the punctures are larger and more shallow. This gives a more opaque appearance to the surface. In some cases, punctostriae may be present around the rear portion. The pilosity appears similar to that of S. richteri. These hairs are erect and vary in length, appearing long {{on each side of the}} pronotum and mesonotum; on the head, the long hairs are seen in longitudinal rows. Numerous appressed pubescent hairs are on the petiolar scale; this is the opposite in S. richteri, as these hairs are sparse. Workers appear red and somewhat yellowish with a brown or completely black gaster. Gastric spots are sometimes seen in larger workers, where they are not as brightly coloured as those in S. richteri. The gastric spot usually covers a small portion of the first gastric tergite. The thorax is concolorous, ranging from light reddish-brown to dark-brown. The legs and coxae are usually lightly shaded. The head has a consistent colour pattern in large workers, with the occiput and vertex appearing brown. Other parts of the head, including the front, genae, and the central region of the <b>clypeus,</b> are either yellowish or yellowish brown. The anterior borders of the genae and mandibles are dark-brown; they also both appear to share the same coloured shade with the occiput. The scapes and funiculi range from being the same colour as the head or shares the same shade with the occiput. Light-coloured areas of the head in small to medium-sized workers is restricted to only the frontal region, with a dark mark resembling an arrow or rocket being present. On occasion, nests may have a series of different colours. For example, workers may be much darker, and the gastric spot may be completely absent or appear dark-brown.|$|E
500|$|M. inquilina {{is a large}} species, {{though it}} is smaller than its host. The body length of the ant is , the head {{including}} the <b>clypeus</b> is , the antennal scape [...] and {{the diameter of the}} eyes are [...] The mandibles are slender with four to five acutely shaped teeth. The antennae are morphologically similar to M. vindex, but it is smaller in comparison; the petiole node is also longer and wider. The postpetiole is subtriangular and more narrow than those seen on M. vindex queens. The <b>clypeus,</b> legs and antennae are covered in punctulates (spots), and the postpetiole and gaster have less punctulates. M. inquilina can be distinguished from other ants due to its lack of pilose (long soft hairs); only small erect setae are mostly found on the mandibles and gastric apex, but short hair {{can be found on the}} legs, and on the dorsum, thorax and cervix. The ant has pubescence (soft short hair) finer and more abundant than M. vindex. The pubescence is greyish in colour, and it is shorter and more noticeable on the <b>clypeus</b> and appendages while it is conspicuous on the postpetiole and gaster.|$|E
500|$|The mandibles have 4 tooth-like (dentate) ridges, which lack cutting edges. [...] The {{compound}} {{eyes are}} nearly vertically aligned, but converge slightly towards {{front of the}} face or apex.

500|$|Males {{and females}} show some {{differences}} in morphology: male jaws (chelicerae) are {{longer and more}} slender than those of females; the male palpal tibiae—the penultimate segment of the pedipalps—are enlarged compared to females; and males alone possess a [...] "clypeal horn", a forward-pointing projection of the <b>clypeus</b> surrounded by long stiff hairs, from which the genus name Unicorn ("one horn" [...] in Latin) derives.|$|E
500|$|The holotype has {{an overall}} body length of {{approximately}} [...] with finely scattered setae on all parts except the notum and propodeum. [...] The head is large with small rounded compound eyes composed {{of about one}} hundred ommatidia. [...] The holotype does not clearly show whether the ocelli are present or absent, but they are clearly absent in the 2005 specimen. [...] The mandibles are [...] scimitar-shaped with no teeth present on the interior sides and almost {{the length of the}} head. The mandibles cross each other near their mid-length and the oral surfaces bear approximately thirty short needle-like setae.

[...] The gena have a distinct tooth-like structure on the lower sides. [...] The eleven segmented antennae are distinct in having a definite clubbed tip, a feature not seen in any other described Cretaceous ants. The apical flagellomere segment is nearly twice the width of the other segments, while the third to the sixth segments are the shortest and the second flagellomere is slightly swollen.|$|E
500|$|Unlike other genera in Dolichoderinae, {{the front}} {{margin of the}} <b>clypeus</b> is not below the mandibles; instead, it is located above them. The eyes are located {{on top of the}} ants' head, and they are noticeably distant from the mandibles. These ants range from small to medium; members of the I. conifer species group measure , being reddish-brown in colour with a {{distinctive}} propodeum, while members of the I. purpureus species group are the largest at [...] Worker castes are rarely polymorphic.|$|E
500|$|The {{body length}} of Z. ferox varies from [...] The head in Z. ferox is broad and {{crescent-shaped}} when viewed dorsally. The frons (upper {{part of the}} insect face) is strongly convex, meaning it curves outwards and the vertexal margin concaves (curves in); it concaves either regularly or strongly. When viewing the full face, the clypeal margin (the border of the <b>clypeus)</b> is broad and concave. The sides are convex and small, yet protruding eyes are present. The posterior corners are round and {{the base of the}} ants' mandibles are concealed by the large expansion of the gena (area below the compound eyes, the insect equivalent to human cheeks). The <b>clypeus</b> is shallow and transverse, and 48 denticles that decrease in length can be seen on the clypeal margin. The denticles are peg-shaped with rounded apices. Dense spine-like setae cover the labrum (a flap-like structure in front of the mouth); these setae are organised into three rows. Each row, on average, contains around 20 setae which increase in length when they are ventral to the <b>clypeus.</b> The mandibles barely overlap medially, with a single large apical tooth and smaller subapical tooth present. The oral surface is covered in spicule-like setae, in which the inner setae are four times longer than the outer setae. The palps are short and the maxillary palps (sensory organs used for tasting and manipulating food) have five segments. The labial palps (counterparts of the maxillary palps used in sensory function for eating) presumably have three segments. The frontal carinae (a pair of cuticular ridges or flanges on the head) are absent in Z. ferox. The antennae are well separated and contain 12 antennomeres, and the scalps are also short; the toruli (socket in which the antenna of an insect articulates) is not significantly raised. The antennal scrobes (grooves {{in the side of the}} head) are shallow and project outwards from the antennal base and towards the ventral margin of the eyes.|$|E
