50|$|The Helicopter Cube {{is made in}} {{the shape}} of a cube, cut into 8 corner pieces and 24 face <b>center</b> <b>pieces.</b> Each corner piece has 3 colors, and each face <b>center</b> <b>piece</b> has only a single color. Unlike the Rubik's Cube, its faces do not rotate; rather, the pieces are {{scrambled}} by rotating around a cube edge.|$|R
50|$|If {{the puzzle}} is only {{scrambled}} using 180° twists, {{then it is}} obviously solvable using only 180° twists. However, if some jumbling moves were made, even if the puzzle was subsequently returned to cube shape, {{it may not be}} possible to solve it using only 180° twists. The {{reason for this is that}} using only 180° twists, each face <b>center</b> <b>piece</b> can only be permuted within a 6-member cycle, often referred to as its orbit. Face <b>center</b> <b>pieces</b> in different orbits cannot be interchanged using only 180° twists. However, jumbling moves are able to permute face <b>center</b> <b>pieces</b> between different orbits, thus leaving the puzzle in a state that cannot be solved by 180° twists alone.|$|R

50|$|The Saunders-Roe SR.N1 ("Saunders-Roe Nautical 1"), {{initially}} {{known as}} the Model A, was the world's first full-sized hovercraft. It was controlled from a small cab placed just forward of the cylindrical <b>center</b> <b>piece</b> set {{into the middle of}} the deck which contained the craft's engine and horizontally mounted fan. For aerodynamic efficiency, the fan and the wall of the <b>center</b> <b>piece</b> had very little clearance, while the exterior wall of the <b>center</b> <b>piece</b> itself was heavily reinforced so that the crew would be protected in the event of a catastrophic engine failure. The core of the vehicle was a rivetted aircraft-grade aluminium alloy sheet buoyancy tank, which had been coated with a thin layer of pure aluminium to protect against corrosion.|$|R
5000|$|The {{player can}} create a [...] "gold-star" [...] by {{arranging}} six like-coloured pieces into a hexagon or [...] "flower", surrounding {{a piece of a}} different colour or type. The surrounding pieces are cleared, and the <b>center</b> <b>piece</b> is replaced by a silver-star (unless the <b>center</b> <b>piece</b> was already a silver-star, in which case a new silver-star drops from the top). A gold-star allows the player to rotate all surrounding pieces clockwise or counterclockwise. Forming a flower of silver-stars changes the <b>center</b> <b>piece</b> into a black pearl, which allows the player to move three surrounding pieces in a Y or inverted Y pattern. The ultimate goal of the game is to form a cluster or flower of black pearls, after which the game will end.|$|R

5000|$|Some {{variations}} of the Professor's Cube {{have one of the}} <b>center</b> <b>pieces</b> marked with a logo, which can be put into four different orientations. This increases the number of permutations by a factor of four to 1.13×1075, although any orientation of this piece could be regarded as correct. By comparison, the number of [...] atoms in the observable universe is estimated at about 1080. Other variations increase the difficulty by making the orientation of all <b>center</b> <b>pieces</b> visible. An example of this is shown below.|$|R

5000|$|However, {{it is also}} {{possible}} to twist an edge by ~71°, such that the base of two groups of a corner piece and a face <b>center</b> <b>piece</b> each is aligned with the rotational plane of a different edge. The second edge can then be rotated, thus intermixing the corner pieces and the face <b>center</b> <b>pieces</b> and leaving the puzzle in a non-cubical shape. This kind of intermixing is known as a jumbling move. Due to the differing shapes of the intermixed pieces, some rotations possible in the cubical shape may no longer be possible in the jumbled shape. By using a combination of such [...] "jumbling" [...] moves, it is possible to return to cubical shape but with some face <b>center</b> <b>pieces</b> in the wrong orientation, thus jutting outwards like spikes rather than lie flat {{on the face of the}} cube. More subtle changes may also be introduced, which are described later.|$|R

50|$|The V-Cube 5 mechanism, {{designed}} by Panagiotis Verdes, has elements {{in common with}} both. The corners reach {{to the center of}} the puzzle (like the original mechanism) and the <b>center</b> <b>pieces</b> hold the central edges in place (like the Eastsheen mechanism). The middle edges and <b>center</b> <b>pieces</b> adjacent to them make up the supporting frame and these have extensions which hold rest of the pieces together. This allows smooth and fast rotation and creating arguably the fastest and most durable version of the puzzle. Unlike the original 5×5×5 design, the V-Cube 5 mechanism was designed with speedcubing in mind.|$|R
50|$|The Megaminx {{is made in}} {{the shape}} of a dodecahedron, and has 12 face <b>center</b> <b>pieces,</b> 20 corner pieces, and 30 edge <b>pieces.</b> The face <b>centers</b> each have a single color, which {{identifies}} the color of that face in the solved state. The edge pieces have two colors, and the corner pieces have three. Each face contains a <b>center</b> <b>piece,</b> 5 corner pieces and 5 edge pieces. The corner and edge pieces are shared with adjacent faces. The face centers can only rotate in place, but the other pieces can be permuted by twisting the face layer around the face center.|$|R
