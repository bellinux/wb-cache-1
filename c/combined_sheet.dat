40|$|Abstract. In recent years, several sheet {{hydroforming}} {{methods have}} been introduced by researchers. Despite the advantages of these methods, they have some limitations. The author [1] already proposed a novel sheet hydroforming method that {{is a combination of}} the standard and hydromechanical sheet hydroforming processes. The proposed method has the advantages of both processes and eliminates their limitations. In this method, a polyurethane diaphragm was used as a part of die-set to control the blank holder force. In this paper, the effect of polyurethane hardness on the effective parameters of the <b>combined</b> <b>sheet</b> hydroforming die-set such as forming pressure, thickness distribution of formed cup and maximum thinning zone of formed cup was investigated experimentally. It was shown that a softer polyurethane needs to a higher oil pressure to prevent wrinkling in the flange of the part. And tearing occurs at higher level of forming pressure. Also it was shown that by softer polyurethane, better thickness distribution was obtained...|$|E
40|$|This MSc thesis {{focuses on}} {{two types of}} quay walls, namely the {{anchored}} quay wall without relieving structure and the quay wall with relieving structure. In the case of high retaining heights the anchored quay wall mostly consists of a <b>combined</b> <b>sheet</b> pile wall, {{which means that the}} wall is composed by tubular steel members that are connected by means of sheet piles. In some cases quay walls are provided with a relieving structure. A relieving structure consists of a concrete structure founded on the <b>combined</b> <b>sheet</b> pile wall and bearing piles. The function of the relieving structure is to reduce the pressure on the retaining wall caused by the surface load and soil on the relieving structure. In this thesis the engineering aspects (moments and displacements of the wall and anchor forces) and the economic aspects (costs) of quay wall designs with and without relieving structure are analysed. Also two calculation methods are compared, the beam on elastic foundation and the finite element method. The results of the calculation showed that from an engineering point of view, the relieving structure is more favourable. The displacements, moments and anchor forces when a relieving structure is present are smaller than the ones calculated when the relieving structure is absent. Also {{in the case of the}} failure of one anchor a relieving structure gives a better redistribution of forces due to the high stiffness of the slab of the relieving structure. The cost estimation performed in this thesis lead to the conclusion that a quay wall with relieving structure is more expensive that a quay wall without it. The main contribution to the costs of the analysed quay walls come from the steel combined wall. The price of the steel primary members (steel tubes) depends on the way they are fabricated. When the tubes exceed certain limit in dimensions the fabrication costs increase with a factor 1. 5 to 2. In this thesis, the calculated elements of all variants exceed this limit, which lead to high costs of the fabrication of steel tubes for both, the quay wall with and without relieving structure. During decision making the parties involved would have to consider whether the reduction of the costs by using a quay wall without relieving structure overrun the aforementioned engineering aspects. An important aspect is that when the relieving structure is absent the dimensions of the primary elements of the combined wall increase and are considered extraordinary in onshore projects. The companies that can install such elements are limited and even offshore equipment would be necessary, which could increase the total costs of the project. Regarding the calculation methods some remarkable differences where found, specially in the calculation of the anchor forces. The moments in the retaining structure for both cases with and without relieving structure calculated with D-sheet vary sligtly from the ones calculated with PLAXIS, a maximum difference of 20 % is found. When the relieving structure is absent the anchor forces calculated with both methods differ in a range of 20 %. When a relieving structure is present D-sheet estimates forces that are 30 % to 35 % lower than PLAXIS when the relieving structure has a length of 10 meters. When the relieving structure length increases to 20 meters, D-sheet calculates anchor forces that are 20 % to 60 % lower than PLAXIS. Literature review showed that the method to estimate horizontal pressures due to strip loads used by D-sheet underestimates the resultant force acting on the wall, which leads to an under estimation of anchor forces.

40|$|The COB Committee F 501 {{has carried}} out a {{research}} project to study the behavior of pits constructed with <b>combined</b> <b>sheet</b> pilling. The goal of the research was to gain insight into the internal forces of construction pits from field measurements. This data could then {{be compared with the}} results of mathematical models to further develop, confirm or sharpen the present requirements and safety factors used for construction pits and underwater concrete floors design. The data was collected from two pits constructed for the tunnel under the Pannerdensch Kanaal (the Netherlands). The pits were equipped with monitoring instrumentation and during the excavation of the pit various measurements were made. This document provides the bibliography from the theoretical research and summarizes the results of the collected data. It appears, for various reasons, that there are many uncertainties in the measurements and the interpretation. It seems {{it is not possible to}} accurately analyze the internal forces within the pit based on the collected field data. A few of the resulting measurements were compared to post-diction analyses from MSheet and PLAXIS calculations. It seems that the deformation of the sheet pile can be fairly well predicted (approx. 20 % below estimation). The underwater concrete floor lifted 5 - 10 mm after dewatering of the excavation; this is in accordance with the CUR 77 prediction. The measurements could not be used for an accurate evaluation of the forces distribution, especially in the underwater concrete floor. This document does, however, provide insight into the possibilities and restrictions of a few techniques that can be used for the monitoring of concrete pits...|$|E
40|$|Since 1970 costal {{structures}} in the Port of Koper are designed as reinforced concrete slabs founded on vertical and inclined steel piles with a slope under the deck. This method of construction requires the excavation of large quantities of silt with bad characteristics, which is used mainly for acquiring new surfaces. The amount of pumped silt, derived from construction of new docks and deepening waterways, exceeds needs. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} take the extra silt elsewhere, which represents an increasing cost for the port. In the thesis is analyzed the possibility of using sheet pile wall on the particular case of the extension of dock number 11. The proposed coastal structure consists of concrete slab founded on steel tubular piles and steel sheet pile wall, which has a soil retaining and bearing function. This method of construction does not required addition excavations. Because of the complexity of the structure, individual elements and appropriate geometry models are acquired step by step. Initially the possibility of using a concrete slab on ground level founded on steel tubular piles and <b>combined</b> <b>sheet</b> pile wall that consist of different types of primary and secondary elements is analyzed. Because of the poor bearing capacity of the soil such type of structure is not an option. The following steps show the need of anchorage, inclination of piles and sheet wall and a relieving platform. Deep relieving platform 4 m below the ground anchored by Müller-Verfahren piles with inclined tubular piles at an gradient of 3 : 1 and sheet pile wall at a gradient of 5, 5 : 1 is appropriate. Cross section and length of elements are set according to the required bearing capacity. The thesis also shows the positive effects of using deep mixing method and additional foundation of the storage area. At the end a list of further controls of cross sections and stability of steel elements is given...|$|E
