Cold water flows through inner square duct, and hot water flows through circular annulus, in counter current fashion. Screw tape inserts found better over twisted tape from thermal performance point of view.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{improved}} efficiency of automotive thermal management system {{is driven by}} the trend that the automotive powertrain system operates towards higher power output with smaller system size. In other words, the intensified heat dissipation loads from the powertrain system need more efficient cooling solutions. One effort is to enhance the thermal performance of the conventional automotive heat transfer fluid, typically ethylene glycol/water mixture, due to its intrinsically poor thermal property. Nano-fluids have been synonymous with the nanotechnology-based advanced cooling fluids which are derived by homogeneously dispersing nanometer-sized particles into conventional heat transfer fluids. In this study, a multi-parameter approach is used to investigate the behavior of the Aluminum Oxide (Al 2 O 3) nano-particle based nano-fluids. The nano-particles are dispersed in 50 / 50 vol. % ethylene glycol/distilled water mixture and the other two base fluids (distilled water and ethylene glycol). Two-step method is used for the nano-fluid sample preparation. Nano-fluid sample is characterized by TEM imaging, particle surface charge, particle sizing, light absorbance and pH. Nano-fluid thermal properties are investigated by measuring the thermal conductivity and viscosity at different temperatures. The nano-particle sedimentation within the nano-fluid is determined. The aging effect on the nano-fluid thermal properties is studied. The results offer multiple-perspective correlations between the nano-fluid characterization and performance. xiv Further, the experimental investigation is conducted to evaluate the forced convection heat transfer coefficient of Al 2 O 3 based nano-fluids in the Reynolds number range of 3000 to 4000. The different nano-particle concentrations are tested. The heat transfer test section is basically a <b>concentric</b> <b>double</b> <b>pipe</b> heat exchanger. The inside pipe is designed to simulate a vehicle radiator tube flow condition, where the heated nano-fluid is circulating. The outside pipe is used for circulating the cooling water. The nano-fluid temperature at the inlet of the test section is kept at 60 °C ± 5 °C. The result develops the correlation between nano-fluid convection heat transfer coefficient and Reynolds number as a function of nano-particle concentration...|$|E
40|$|Foi realizado um estudo sobre o efeito do tipo de fluidos na transferência de calor. Pretende-se determinar a influência da concentração da solução de Goma de Xantano, do número de Reynolds, do número de Weissenberg, da temperatura e do tempo de escoamento no coeficiente de transferência de calor, jH. O estudo da transferência de calor foi feito num permutador de tubos duplos concêntricos. Já o estudo da reologia foi realizado num reómetro. Na caracterização reológica das soluções de XG, a viscosidade aumenta com a concentração das soluções, diminui para taxas de deformação crescentes e com o aumento da temperatura para ambas as soluções. Os dados mostram um aumento da intensidade da pseudoplasticidade com a concentração do polímero, sendo os valores representados pelo modelo de Sisco. A degradação da solução de 0, 20 % de goma de xantano a 25 ºC, com o escoamento, é muito acelerada. Os resultados dos ensaios apresentam uma diminuição da viscosidade de 9, 4 % a 22, 9 %, para tempos de escoamento de 12 a 47 horas, respectivamente. Num escoamento turbulento em conduta de secção {{circular}} constante os resultados mostram uma redução de arrasto total de 18 para 33 %. Para a solução de 0, 10 % de XG, verifica-se um aumento do calor transferido de 115 % e de 130 %, quando a temperatura aumenta de 25 ºC para 36 ºC, respectivamente. A água apresenta valores de calor transferido superiores, cerca de 170 %, aos da solução de 0, 1 %XG. O factor de correlação empírico de Colbourn (jH), utilizado neste trabalho apresenta valores de acordo com a relação de Cho and Hartnett (1985) : jH< 2 /f. Quando o caudal do fluido quente aumenta verifica-se uma diminuição do factor jH. Em relação ao tempo de escoamento verifica-se uma diminuição de cerca de 70 % do coeficiente de transferência de calor ao fim de 47 horas. Finalmente verificamos uma diminuição do factor de transferência de calor com o aumento da temperatura do fluido quente, para ambas as concentrações de goma de xantano. Para as soluções de 0, 10 e 0, 20 % de XG essa diminuição variou entre 38 e 15 % e entre 34 e 3 %, respectivamente. A {{study on}} the effect of the type of fluids in heat transfer was carried through. It is intended to determine the influence of the concentration of the solution of Gum of Xantano, of the Reynolds number, the number of Weissenberg, the temperature and the time of draining in the coefficient of transference of heat, jH. The study of the heat transfer was made in an <b>concentric</b> <b>double</b> <b>pipe</b> heat exchanger. The study of the rheology was carried through in a rheometer. In the reologic characterization of the XG solutions, viscosity increases with the concentration of the solutions, diminishes for increasing taxes of deformation and with the increase of the temperature for both the solutions. The data show an increase of the intensity of the pseudoplasticity with the concentration of polymer, being the values represented for the model of Sisco. The degradation of the solution of 0, 20 % of xantano gum at 25 ºC, with the draining, is very speed up. The results of the assays present a reduction of the 9, 4 % viscosity 22. 9 %, for times of draining of 12 the 47 hours, respectively. In a turbulent draining behaviour with a constant circular section, the results show a reduction of total drag of 18 for 33 %. For the solution of 0, 10 % of XG, an increase of the transferred heat of 115 % is verified and of 130 %, when the temperature increases of 25 ºC for 36 ºC, respectively. The water presents values of transferred heat superior, about 170 %, to the ones of the solution of 0, 1 % XG. The empirical factor of correlation of Colbourn (jH), used in this work presents values in accordance with the relation of Cho and Hartnett (1985) : jH< 2 /f. When the flow of the hot fluid increases it verifies a reduction of the factor jH. In relation to the draining time, a reduction of about 70 % of the coefficient of t heat transfer at the end of 47 hours is verified. Finally we verify a reduction of the factor of heat transfer with the increase of the temperature of the hot fluid, for both the concentrations of xantano gum. For the solutions of 0, 10 and 0, 20 % of XG this reduction varied between 38 and 15 % and 34 and 3 %, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The triple {{concentric}} pipes {{heat exchanger}} is an improved version of <b>double</b> <b>pipe</b> heat exchanger. Most {{of the previous}} study on the heat exchanger is confined to two fluids and few of many possible flow arrangements. The present study involves the sizing of triple concentric pipes heat exchanger where in two cold water streams flow through the central tube and outer annular space at same mass flow rates and same inlet temperatures in co-current direction while hot water flows through inner annular space in counter-current direction. This paper proposes a basic procedure for calculating overall heat transfer coefficients and length of triple concentric pipes heat exchanger. Length of triple pipe heat exchanger is computed for a required temperature drop of hot water with available dimensions of three pipes by LMTD method. Overall heat transfer coefficient and length of the equivalent <b>double</b> <b>pipe</b> heat exchanger are {{compared with that of}} the triple pipe heat exchanger. The theoretical analysis shows that introducing an intermediate <b>pipe</b> to the <b>double</b> <b>pipe</b> heat exchanger reduces effective length of heat exchanger, which results in savings in material and space.
