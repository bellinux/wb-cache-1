It is he who considers slavery under Henri Christophe worse than that under French rule because blacks are now enslaving fellow blacks.

5|$|Starting in 1699, {{other members}} of the Royal Society (of which Newton was a member) accused Leibniz of plagiarism. The dispute then broke out in full force in 1711 when the Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true {{discoverer}} and labelled Leibniz a fraud. This study was cast into doubt when it was later found that Newton himself wrote the study's <b>concluding</b> <b>remarks</b> on Leibniz. Thus began the bitter controversy which marred the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the latter's death in 1716.|$|E

5|$|Starting in March 1984, Congress chaired {{a series}} of {{hearings}} into FX. William Schneider, Jr., the Under Secretary of State for Security Assistance, Science and Technology, testified that FX policy might not result in any sales, in spite of any government support. He stated that the sales of arms such as FX was primarily a matter of foreign policy, secondarily a commercial venture. Thomas V. Jones, Northrop's CEO, argued {{that there was little}} point independently developing aircraft if companies were reliant on the government to sell them. He suggested the FX concept be dropped, and F-20 allowed to be sold by the vendor. Additionally, Brigadier General Thomas Baker, USAF Director of International Programs, testified that the Air Force was not actively marketing FX. He observed that over four years the US had sold 100 fighters to 29 countries, none were FX. He also compared France's aircraft exports, showing a market for a low-cost fighter existed. In the Committee's <b>concluding</b> <b>remarks,</b> the State Department and DOD were accused of rhetoric, and lacking support, on FX.|$|E

500|$|District {{court judge}} James M. Burns, sitting by designation, wrote a {{separate}} concurring opinion in which he criticized the [...] "recalcitrance of Washington State officials" [...] in their management of the state's fisheries. Judge Burns argued that Washington's recalcitrance forced Judge Boldt to act as [...] "perpetual fishmaster" [...] and noted that he [...] "deplore" [...] situations in which district court judges are forced to act as [...] "enduring managers of the fisheries, forests, and highways". In his <b>concluding</b> <b>remarks,</b> Judge Burns argued that Washington's responsibility to manage its natural resources [...] "should neither escape notice nor be forgotten." ...|$|E
500|$|Justice Scalia {{also criticized}} the majority's {{conclusion}} that the tip provided reasonable suspicion that Lorenzo and Jose Prado Navarette were driving while drunk, because [...] "the truck might have swerved to avoid an animal, a pothole, or a jaywalking pedestrian .... Or, indeed, he might have intentionally forced the tipster off the road because of some personal animus, or hostility to her 'Make Love, Not War' bumper sticker." [...] Furthermore, Justice Scalia argued that one discrete instance of irregular driving does not give rise to the reasonable suspicion of an ongoing threat of an intoxicated driver on the road. Justice Scalia also argued that the anonymous tip's claims of reckless driving were ultimately discredited {{by the fact that}} officers followed Lorenzo and Jose for five minutes, but observed nothing suspicious. He wrote, [...] "I take it as a fundamental premise of our intoxicated-driving laws that a driver soused enough to swerve once can be expected to swerve again — and soon. If he does not, and if the only evidence of his first episode of irregular driving is a mere inference from an uncorroborated, vague, and nameless tip, then the Fourth Amendment requires that he be left alone." [...] In his <b>concluding</b> <b>remarks,</b> Justice Scalia wrote [...] "runken driving is a serious matter, but so is the loss of our freedom to come and go as we please without police interference .... After today’s opinion all of us on the road, and not just drug dealers, are at risk of having our freedom of movement curtailed on suspicion of drunkenness, based upon a phone tip, true or false, of a single instance of careless driving." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Qing dynasty writer Zhao Yi refuted the Jin Shu {{claim that}} Chen Shou was prejudiced against Zhuge Liang in the Sanguozhi, and remarked that the claim was [...] "an uninformed statement". He commented that {{military}} leadership {{did not necessarily}} had {{to be regarded as}} Zhuge Liang's forte because Zhuge also made outstanding achievements in other fields. Zhao also pointed out two pieces of evidence which contradict the Jin Shu claim: Chen Shou gave highly positive comments about Zhuge Liang's ability as a politician in the Zhuge Liang Collection and in his personal commentary at the end of Zhuge's biography in the Sanguozhi. Zhao Yi's <b>concluding</b> <b>remarks</b> on this issue were that Chen Shou had clearly identified Zhuge Liang's strengths and weaknesses in his appraisal of Zhuge Liang in the Sanguozhi.|$|E
2500|$|The Qing dynasty writer Pan Mei (潘眉) rebutted the Jin Shus account about Chen Shou {{attempting}} to extort from the Dings {{and called it}} [...] "uninformed". He disproved {{the claim that the}} Ding brothers were very famous officials in Wei by pointing out that they had neither held important appointments nor made any significant achievements. Pan also felt that a historian was clearly justified if he decided to not write biographies for the Ding brothers, because, in his opinion, the Dings had committed grievous sins – instigating sibling rivalry and causing instability in the Wei imperial clan – which made them unworthy of having biographies in historical records. Pan further noted that there were also other notable persons in Wei (e.g. Chen Lin, Wu Zhi and Yang Xiu) who did not have biographies in the Sanguozhi, so being notable did not mean that a person should have a biography written for him. His <b>concluding</b> <b>remarks</b> on this issue were that the Jin Shu made a malicious claim (about Chen Shou).|$|E

Upon announcing the resumption of talks between Israel and the Palestinians {{at a press conference}} delivered at the U.S. State Department, Livni criticized the [...] "cynicism and pessimism" [...] surrounding Israeli–Palestinian peace process, and expressed hope that the negotiators would do everything in their power to transform a [...] "spark of hope into something real and lasting." [...] In <b>concluding</b> <b>remarks</b> praised for their poignancy, she said, [...] "I believe that history is not made by cynics. It is made by realists who are not afraid to dream. And let us be these people." [...] The process collapsed in April 2014 when internal political difficulties prevented Israel from releasing a promised fourth tranche of pre-Oslo prisoners and the Palestinians reacted by acceding to several international treaties. Indyk cited Israel's settlement policy during the talks as a critical factor leading to the collapse.|$|E
