Rowlingâs work as contributors to her popularity. This round table raised several issues, in particular cultural boundaries and contractual constraints set by Warner Bros. A major concern seemed to be the pressure for speed translation. The phenomenon of online translation has become a threat for publishing companies. Pirate translations are produced much faster, as they are done by several unqualified translators. Their quality often leaves a lot to be desired, but a text offered as a translation is readily acknowledged as accurate (Toury, 1995 : 26). Harry Potter (hereafter HP) fans are eager to read the new book and the abundance of these online translations has made readers aware of the process of translation and critical of the translatorâs decisions, as Klaus Fritz, the German translator, has declared.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{problems}} of simultaneous translation"(SI) of scientific discussion at the <b>Conference</b> on Training <b>Translators</b> and Interpreters in the New Millennium, the development of which greatly depends on extralinguistic, external conference conditions. Text linguistics considers text not only as a grammatical unit larger than a sentence but also and mainly as a semantic unit, as a conveyer of meaning. Discussion is a very special text type. Its peculiarities arise from its oral and immediate nature. It differs from purely scientific language (characteristically objective, dispassionate, and the result of prior deliberation) and ordinary dialogue (characteristically emotionally colored, spontaneous, and having elliptical phrases). To interpret, one must. understand. The message the interpreter receives and that he or she must understand in order to reconstruct it in the other language is transmitted in oral and spontaneous form. The process of SI is not a simple transformation of text from a source language (SL) into a target language (TL), but is a complex process. The fact that the recipient is both recipient and transmitter of the information simultaneously strongly influences the process of interpreting. The aim {{of this article is to}} show how the interpreter, as a low-knowledge individual, manages to establish unhampered communication between participants of a discussion speaking different languages; how he or she manages to produce a coherent bilingual text of a discussion.

40|$|Despite growing {{awareness}} of the need for professionalisation, especially in public service settings, the study of interpreters’ professional status has been widely neglected in interpreting research. Yet, investigating status may contribute to understanding issues concerning codes of ethics, new developments in the T&I market, the state of the interpreting profession, public opinions about the profession, not to mention the interpreter’s roles and responsibilities. Research to date has focused almost exclusively on the status of translators (Katan 2011; Sela-Sheffy and Shlesinger 2011; Pym 2012), though neither systematically nor extensively. The first attempt to study conference interpreters’ occupational status from a sociological point of view was carried out only {{a couple of years ago}} by Dam and Zethsen (2013), though their analysis compared <b>conference</b> interpreters’ and <b>translators</b> professional statuses. A thorough review of literature reveals that no empirical study on status focusing exclusively on the interpreting profession has been carried out to date. The aim of the present research is therefore to analyse conference interpreters’ and public service interpreters’ self-perception of their occupational status, as well as the factors which affect their perception of status. A comparison between the status of conference interpreters (both staff and free-lance) and public service interpreters may help answer to the following questions: 1) what influences interpreters’ self-perception of their status?; 2) are conference interpreting and PSI two parallel professions that will never intersect?; 3) what does society think of the interpreting profession?; 4) what is the social value of the interpreting profession? The paper will also illustrate the provisional results of a worldwide web-based questionnaire (one for conference interpreters and one for public service interpreters) distributed to professional associations in 64 countries. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Translation studies {{centring}} on medieval texts {{have prompted}} {{new ways to}} look at the texts themselves, but also at the exchange and transmission of culture in the European Middle Ages, inside and outside Europe. The present volume reflects, in the range and scope of its essays, the itinerant nature of the Medieval <b>Translator</b> <b>Conference,</b> at the same time inviting readers to reflect on the geography of medieval translation. By dividing the essays presented here into four groups, the volume highlights lines of communication and shifts in areas of interest, connecting the migrating nature of the translated texts to the cultural, political and linguistic factors underlying the translation process. Translation was, in each case under discussion, the result or the by-product of a transnational movement that prompted the circulation of ideas and texts within religious and/or political discussion and exchange. Thus the volume opens with a group of contributions discussing the cultural exchange between Western Europe and the Middle East, identifying the pivotal role of Church councils, aristocratic courts, and monasteries in the production of translation. The following section concentrates on the literary exchanges between three close geographical and cultural areas, today identifiable with France, Italy and England, allowing us to re-think traditional hypotheses on sites of literary production, and to reflect on the triangulation of language and manuscript exchange. From this triangulation the book moves into a closer discussion of translations produced in England, showing in the variety and chronological span covered by the contributions the development of a rich cultural tradition in constant dialogue with Latin as well as contemporary vernaculars. The final essays offer a liminal view, considering texts translated into non-literary forms, or the role played by the onset of printing in the dissemination of translation, thus highlighting the continuity and closeness of medieval translation with the Renaissance. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{professional}} status of interpreters {{is one of}} the most neglected topics in Interpreting Studies today. Scholarly literature has focused mainly on the status of translators (Sela-Sheffy and Shlesinger 2011; Pym 2012; Dam and Zethsen 2013; 2016; Ruokonen 2016), but scarce attention has been paid to the current state of the interpreting profession. A recent attempt to study conference interpreters' occupational status was carried out by Dam and Zethsen (2013) in their analysis on the self- perception of <b>conference</b> interpreters' and <b>translators</b> {{professional status}}. Their main hypothesis was that interpreters would position themselves at the top of the status continuum, whereas translators would place themselves at a lower level. Data gathered from their on-line survey did not confirm their hypothesis, a surprising outcome which begged for further research. As far as public service interpreters are concerned, several scholars (A ngelelli 2004; Ricoy et al. 2009; Sela-Sheffy & Shlesinger 2011) have speculated that their status is low and that public service interpreting is still undergoing professionalisation. Nevertheless, the questions which need to be answered are: what is the current state of the interpreting profession? How do interpreters perceive their status? What role do technology, the mass media, economic and social changes play in the sociological evolution of the interpreter's professional status? What are the main challenges for the future? Building on these premises, the present paper aims to fill this knowledge gap by investigating the self- perceived professional status of conference and public service interpreters. Drawing on sociological theories (Brinkerhoff 2013), this study will present and compare the results of two surveys on the self- perceived status of conference and public service interpreters, completed by 1693 respondents worldwide. A special attention will be paid to the curren t situation of the T&I market, the social value of interpreting and the future of the profession. status: publishe...|$|R
