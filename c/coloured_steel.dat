50|$|In 1835 Baxter {{was granted}} Patent No. 6916 - Improvements in Producing <b>Coloured</b> <b>Steel</b> Plate, Copper Plate and other Impressions, which {{outlined}} the combined intaglio and relief process {{he would continue}} to use for the next thirty years. Baxter's original patent ran for 14 years; after the renewal of his patent in 1849 for another five years he began to sell licenses for the use of his printing process to other printing firms.|$|E
50|$|Considered {{to be of}} a “remarkable modern design”, it {{consists}} of a 27 m high metal framework tower of dark <b>coloured</b> <b>steel,</b> enclosing a central core with exposed flights of steps which lead {{to the top of}} the tower, from where the light is shown. With a focal height of 31 m above sea level, the light can be seen for 16 nautical miles. Its light characteristic is made up of a pattern of two flashes of white light every seven seconds.|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for <b>coloured</b> stainless <b>steels</b> which combine the advantages of conventional steels with beautiful surface finish, texture and stylishness. Of the various methods used for colouring stainless steels, chemical method called the International Nickel Co. (INCO) method and an Electrolytic Method called Alternating Current Electrolysing (AEC) method have gained popularity and are being used commercially. Preparation of stainless steel surface {{is very important for}} the appearance of <b>coloured</b> stainless <b>steel.</b> The scope of application of <b>coloured</b> stainless <b>steels</b> is very diverse, Corrosion resistance of <b>coloured</b> stainless <b>steels,</b> as measured by pitting potential and the salt spray, {{has been found to be}} better than non-coloured stainless steel. The hardness and the film adhesion is excellent. The paper gives in brief the ACE method along with results carried out on electrolytically <b>coloured</b> stainless <b>steel...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{site was}} redeveloped in 1999 to {{incorporate}} two platforms, lifts, a cafe {{and access to}} the University of Technology. The site was fitted with public artwork created by Merilyn Fairskye, including murals, illuminated wall panels and four towers with <b>coloured</b> <b>steel</b> ribbons inside, representing the four elements (Air, Water, Earth and Fire). Railway Square is dominated by the rising glass bus terminal structure, and by four sculpture light towers. The area is now an interchange for State Transit Authority bus routes.|$|E
50|$|There {{were three}} main {{ways in which}} the steel of the armour was coloured: bluing, browning, and russeting. Bluing the steel gave it a deep, {{brilliant}} blue-black finish. Browning, as the name would suggest, coloured the steel a dark brown, which contrasted vividly with gilding as in the harness of George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland. Finally, russeting imparted a dark-red or purple hue to the steel, which was also typically used in conjunction with gilding. All of these base colours would be applied uniformly to the steel of the armour, and then strips of differently <b>coloured</b> <b>steel</b> would be laid across to create patterns, or etched sections of the armour would be gilded. The Earl of Worcester's armour is one striking example of a scalloped design which was originally gilded over dark blued steel.|$|E
50|$|Modern lines {{characterized}} {{the architecture of}} the Quebec pavilion. Its exterior walls were made of glass; by day, these were enormous rectangular mirrors and, by night, an illuminated display case. Surrounded by water, the structure was accessible by way of a footbridge. Visitors then entered by large elevators; inside the pavilion. The pavilion's modern architecture and interior exhibit were {{in sharp contrast to the}} traditional image Canadians then had of this province. The exhibits focusing on urbanization, industrialization, business and education presented Quebec as a province with its eye on the future. Natural resources, forestry and water in particular were also presented as growth industries. In this reflection of Quebec society, the minimalist display methods themselves were an attraction: thousands of <b>coloured</b> <b>steel</b> cubes were used as part of the exhibits which was bathed in an electronic score by Quebec composer Gilles Tremblay in which synthetized whir, twitter and roar complemented the visual suggestions. High overhead, the distinctive soundtracks collided and coalesced into a contrapuntal aural landscape.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with the}} Seagram Building {{and a number}} of Mies's {{subsequent}} projects, the Toronto-Dominion Centre follows the theme of the darkly <b>coloured,</b> rigidly ordered, <b>steel</b> and glass edifice set in an open plaza, itself surrounded by a dense and erratic, pre-existing urban fabric. The TD Centre, however, comprises a collection of structures spread across a granite plinth, all regulated in three dimensions and from the largest scale to the smallest, by a mathematically ordered, [...] grid.|$|R

40|$|Stainless steels {{are used}} {{in an array of}} {{applications}} where their ability to take on colour is of aesthetic value. Although thermal colouring (heat tinting) is known, particularly in terms of its effect on welds, the surface development of thermally <b>coloured</b> stainless <b>steel</b> has not been considered in detail. This paper demonstrates the colour development of a bright annealed 304 stainless steel with time at temperature. The colour development has been quantified using colour spectrophotoscopy and the colour related to the growth of surface oxide features by scanning electron microscopy and the chemical profiles by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). There is a clear development of both the oxide thickness and chemistry, with increasing time with small nodules being the main features seen {{across the surface of the}} samples with time. The oxides have been shown to comprise of an outer iron rich oxide and an inner chromium/iron spinel layer...|$|R

Grey curtains were parted for her, and as she came between them she dazzled {{the eyes of the}} audience for she wore no fewer than £25,000 worth of diamonds and pearls lent by a Bond Street jeweller. Two detectives stood by ... she was attired in a wonderful <b>steel</b> <b>coloured</b> brocade evening-wrap lined with vivid rose, an excellent contrast to her dark olive skin and pansy brown eyes. When she shed her cloak she showed a simple white satin gown draped around her. She wore gold shoes but no stockings, for she never wears stockings." ...|$|R
40|$|Manipulating shape, colour and {{geometry}} of street signs can be captured in jewellery form. Brooches or neckpieces {{placed on the}} body reveal the interplay of jewellery pieces as interpretive - a statement of groupings - the street theatre of street signage when juxtaposing several pieces together in a new context are possibilities. The striping of street signage can be further conveyed in jewellery with industrial quality <b>coloured</b> laminates, <b>steel</b> and acrylic. Interpreting motifs from their original site and placing them into a new context questions our familiarity with street signage as a cautionary or directional device. In the new context, by situating jewellery on the body, makes the impersonal personal. My intention is to capture and manipulate the shape, colour and {{geometry of}} street signs. Placement {{on the body of}} brooches or neckpieces may reveal the interplay of jewellery pieces as interpretive &ndash; a statement of groupings &ndash; the street theatre of street signage when juxtaposing several pieces together in a new context. In the landscape, striped cautionary signs are designed to direct our gaze and our path. Abundance and continual exposure lessens impact and so may override the intention of such signs. However, bringing iconic motifs into a jewellery context presents striped street signs for reconsideration. A reinterpretation is made through recontextualising into wearable jewellery and may question our familiarity as a cautionary or directional device...|$|R
6000|$|One {{day that}} summer, I {{came away from}} a luncheon in company of an old College chum. Always {{exciting}} to meet those one hasn't seen for years; and as we walked across the Park together I kept looking at him askance. He had altered a good deal. Lean he always was, but now very lean, and so upright that his parson's coat was overhung by {{the back of his}} long and narrow head, with its dark grizzled hair, which thought had not yet loosened on his forehead. His clean-shorn face, so thin and oblong, was remarkable only for the eyes: dark-browed and lashed, and <b>coloured</b> like bright <b>steel,</b> they had a fixity in them, a sort of absence, on one couldn't tell what business. They made me think of torture. And his mouth always gently smiling, as if its pinched curly sweetness had been commanded, was the mouth of a man crucified--yes, crucified! ...|$|R
5000|$|A two-page <b>coloured</b> Sapphire & <b>Steel</b> picture strip, {{written by}} Angus Allan and drawn by Arthur Ranson, {{appeared}} in the Look-In magazine. It ran {{for a total of}} 76 issues from 1979-1981 [...] - [...] with a break of 13 issues between runs [...] - [...] and formed 14 untitled stories. It would appear that Ranson used photographs of Joanna Lumley and David McCallum from the first television adventure for reference, as Sapphire and Steel are almost always depicted wearing the outfits from this story. In the third story, Lead makes a cameo appearance and displays a further power: turning British soldiers from the Napoleonic War into miniature (and presumably lead) toy soldiers. However, the picture strip version of Lead [...] - [...] though depicted as a powerfully built black man [...] - [...] was not based upon Val Pringle who played the part on television; it can only be assumed that Ranson had very {{little in the way of}} photographic reference material in this case. In addition, a one-off Sapphire & Steel text story titled The Albatross was published in the 1981 Look-In Annual. This was illustrated in black and white by Arthur Ranson.|$|R
