40|$|An {{improved}} Jones {{sample splitter}} is described which is faster to operate than the conventional type, yet requires no special skill or training. Samples obtained with this instrument are {{free from the}} occasional erratic samples obtained with ordinary Jones sample splitters. Working drawings are given for this improved sample splitter, which can be built with hand tools. The sample splitter was tested with small gravel, granules, and sand in which the percentage of each constituent was accurately known. Three series of 24 samples each were taken and sieved; in each series one detail of technique was varied. The components separated by sieving were returned to the original mixture in each test to keep {{the conditions of the}} experiment nearly constant. Summarized instruction are given for the best technique of operation. The second part of the paper deals with methods used to measure the performance of the improved sample splitter. The concept of a state of control is discussed. The calculations required to detect lack of constancy in the <b>chance</b> <b>cause</b> system, biased percentages, or the presence of a predominating cause of variation are shown. The principle that variability in comparable series of samples tends to diminish as the state of control is approached was found to apply in the present study. These methods of statistical analysis are very general and may be applied to field sampling studies or wherever quantitative measurements are made on a series of samples suspected of coming from an essentially homogeneous unit or constant <b>chance</b> <b>cause</b> system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} analyzing the variations of the RGB spectrum of lesion skin images using the novel segmentation process based on Six Sigma concept. This analysis further contemplates on the incidence and propagation of cancer. It {{is based on the}} underlying principles of Dr. W. A. Shewhart’s Control Charts, which focuses {{on the fact that the}} variability does exist in all repetitive processes. The heterogeneous color variation within the skin is considered as an assignable cause and is due to the secretion of excess melanin. These variations possess greater magnitude as compared to the <b>chance</b> <b>causes</b> due to the color variations found in normal skins. The power of control chart that lies in its ability to separate out this assignable cause, which is one of inherent mnemonics of Malignant Melanoma, is exhibited. The proposed Six Sigma based segmentation identifies the normal skin region from the regions of lesions, besides its fuzzy border. Results show that the method produces a robust segmentation of regions of high color contrast...|$|R
40|$|Control charts {{are widely}} used in {{statistical}} process control to detect changes in a production process and for monitoring a process {{to make sure that}} it is in control. In conventional statistical process control, the pattern of <b>chance</b> <b>causes</b> is often assumed to follow normal distribution. It is well known that the assumption of normality or any specific parametric form for the process distribution is too restrictive. In such situations, distribution-free or nonparametric control charts can serve the purpose better. In this paper, distribution-free control charts are developed based on a class of one-sample test statistics with sub-samples of size two due to Mehra, Prasad and Madhava Rao (Austral. J. Statist. 32 : 373392, 1990). The control charts based on their statistic (-chart) are easy to understand and to use. The performance of the proposed procedures is studied through the average run length, which is the expected number of samples required by the procedure to signal out of control. It is observed that the performance of the proposed chart is better than the existing charts in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Control {{limits are}} one of the main {{elements}} of control charts. Generally speaking, a control chart is the graphical display of a statistic regarding the quality characteristic of interest, computed from a sample randomly drawn from a process at different time instances. As natural variability is always present in a process, we expect some variability on the control chart. Excessive variability, owing to special cause events, is referred to as being due to an assignable cause. Otherwise, when only <b>chance</b> <b>causes</b> – also called common causes of variation – are operating, the process is said to be in statistical control. In order {{to make a decision about}} the status of the process, control limits are typically positioned so that under the hypothesis of no deviation in the process, a type I probability error corresponds to an economically acceptable average run length. In this article, we discuss in a general manner how to compute control limits, and give some remarks on how limits should be computed so as to reduce false out of control signals...|$|R
