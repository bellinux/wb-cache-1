5|$|Outside of the {{seasonal}} variations, the geothermal gradient of temperatures through the crust is 25–30°C (77–86°F) per kilometer of depth {{in most of}} the world. The conductive heat flux averages 0.1MW/km2. These values are much higher near tectonic plate boundaries where the crust is thinner. They may be further augmented by fluid circulation, either through magma <b>conduits,</b> hot springs, hydrothermal circulation or a combination of these.|$|E

While teams are sent to patch them up, the shield starts to collapse, resulting {{in the deaths of}} one team. McKay later decides to collapse the shield to cover the central tower in order to conserve power, and give Zelenka (David Nykl) time to patch up the <b>conduits.</b> However, the city approaches an asteroid belt, {{and the only way to}} go through without using up the power is for Sheppard to lead a fleet of Puddle Jumpers and clear a path. Although inexperienced, the pilots succeed, but impacts from the stragglers damage the stardrive control crystals, and they have to fix it before jumping again.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{may have}} once been a towering stratovolcano, Goat Rocks has {{undergone}} extensive erosion since its extinction. Once eruptions ceased, the ongoing forces of glacial erosion, as well as hydrothermal alteration of the volcano's interior, stripped away layers of volcanic ash deposits and lava flows, uncovering the rocky lava spines where magma had cooled and hardened within the <b>conduits</b> of the volcano. Nearly all the remaining volcanic debris has been partially covered by a younger layer of rock.|$|E
5|$|Contractors in {{this type}} of {{construction}} faced many obstacles, both natural and man-made. They had to deal with rock formations and ground water, which required pumps. Twelve miles of sewers, as well as water and gas mains, electric <b>conduits,</b> and steam pipes had to be rerouted. Street railways had to be torn up to allow the work. The foundations of tall buildings often ran near the subway construction, and in some cases needed underpinning to ensure stability.|$|E
50|$|Aluminum <b>conduit,</b> {{similar to}} {{galvanized}} steel <b>conduit,</b> is a rigid tube, generally used in {{commercial and industrial}} applications where a higher resistance to corrosion is needed. Such locations would include food processing plants, where large amounts of water and cleaning chemicals would make galvanized <b>conduit</b> unsuitable. Aluminum cannot be directly embedded in concrete, since the metal reacts with the alkalis in cement. The <b>conduit</b> may be coated to prevent corrosion by incidental contact with concrete. Aluminum <b>conduit</b> is generally lower cost than steel {{in addition to having}} a lower labor cost to install, since a length of aluminum <b>conduit</b> will have about one-third the weight of an equally-sized rigid steel <b>conduit.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{engine was}} mounted on two main support frames that were {{supported}} by two tubular struts. The frame structure was triangulated and emanated from the fuselage. The main frames were bolted onto the power plant in its top quarter. In turn, the frames were attached to the firewall by universal joints. The firewall itself was constructed from asbestos mesh with dural sheets on both sides. All <b>conduits</b> passing through had to be arranged so that no harmful gases could penetrate the cockpit.|$|E
40|$|Improving {{effectiveness}} turbine was {{and remains}} {{a key issue}} for today. In order to improve {{the efficiency of the}} turbine is necessary to reduce losses in the steam turbine exhaust <b>conduit.</b> This paper presents the design optimization exhaust <b>conduit</b> steam turbine K- 27 - 2. 9 produced by JSC «KTW» at the design stage. The aims of optimizing the design were: decreasing hydraulic resistance of the <b>conduit,</b> reduction of non-uniformity of the flow at the outlet of the <b>conduit,</b> equalizing steam flow ahead of the condenser tube bundle. The <b>conduit</b> models were made and flows in it were simulated in environment of the Solid Works and its application COSMOS Flo Works. As the initial <b>conduit</b> model was selected exhaust <b>conduit</b> of turbine PT- 25 / 34 - 3. 4 produced by JSC «KTW». Was obtained by the calculated velocity field at the outlet of the <b>conduit.</b> The analysis of the calculation results revealed the necessity of changes to the initial design of the <b>conduit.</b> The changes were accompanied by calculating currents flow in the <b>conduit,</b> and assessed the impact of design changes {{on the nature of the}} course. Further transformation of the construction of the <b>conduit</b> was held on the results of these calculations. Construction changes are not touched by the outer geometry of the <b>conduit,</b> and were introduced to meet technological. According to calculation results, conclusions were drawn and selected three versions of the <b>conduit.</b> Given are the research results for the initial <b>conduit</b> model and modified design versions. In order to evaluate the flow degree of irregularity the momentum factor (Bussinesku factor) for outlet crosssection of the selected <b>conduit</b> design version. Analysis of the research results made it possible to determine optimum design of the exhaust <b>conduit.</b> Introducing the suggested alterations in the <b>conduit</b> design will result in improvement of heat exchange in the condenser, an increase in reliability of the tube bundle operation, a decrease in noise and power losses, as well as a rise of the turbine plant efficiency in general. </p...|$|R
30|$|Wilson et al. (1980) {{discussed}} that <b>conduit</b> constriction due to downfaulting of {{the upper}} portion of the <b>conduit</b> wall would trigger {{a reduction in the}} discharge rate. It is, however, impossible to simulate the same situation in our model because it assumes a common <b>conduit</b> radius that is independent of depth. Instead, we evaluate here an effect of uniform expansion or shrink of the <b>conduit,</b> as already shown in Fig. 5 (b). As expected, the narrowing of a <b>conduit</b> causes a decrease in the discharge rate. However, the pressure reduction required for the termination of lava effusion is not significantly dependent on the change in a <b>conduit</b> radius. Therefore, the <b>conduit</b> radius should become very narrow in order to stop the effusion. In addition, there are no observations of ground deformation which suggests such a collapse of the <b>conduit.</b> Accordingly, we do not consider that the shrink of the <b>conduit</b> radius is the cause of the termination of the effusive stage in Shinmoe-dake 2011 eruption.|$|R
30|$|We {{simulate}} an open <b>conduit</b> {{and changes}} in the <b>conduit</b> radius caused by magma pressure. In the shallow part of the <b>conduit</b> (< 1 km), magma pressure variations are predicted to be less than tens of MPa from the lithostatic pressure. Assuming a rigidity of surrounding rocks of 1 – 10 GPa at a depth of 1 km, we estimate the changes of the circular <b>conduit</b> radius to be 0.025 – 0.25 %. Even when the <b>conduit</b> shape is elliptical, with an aspect ratio of 10, the radius change is 2.5 %. These values are negligibly small compared with changes in the magma flow within the <b>conduit,</b> so that we may reasonably assume a <b>conduit</b> with a constant radius.|$|R
5|$|According to the church's caretaker, Brenda Hiett, the church's {{roof and}} siding were {{installed}} around 1900. A wrought iron fence, made by Stewart Iron Works in Cincinnati, Ohio, was installed around the church's cemetery. Electrical <b>conduits</b> {{were added to}} the interior of the church when it was electrified around 1930, and further electrical updates were made in 2011. The church's perimeter foundation of concrete blocks replaced the original stone piers in the early 1970s, and its wide, heart pine plank floors were sanded and re-lacquered. Around 1990, the Stewart Iron Works fence and gate were restored by White’s Ornamental Ironworks.|$|E
5|$|Advanced {{technology}} {{was required for}} the planning and construction of large reservoirs and canals. When constructing reservoirs, the gaps between low ridges in the dry zone plains were used for damming water courses. Two different techniques were used in construction; one method involved making an embankment using natural rock formations across a valley and the other involved diverting water courses through constructed canals to reservoirs. All the reservoirs and canals in an area were interconnected by an intricate network, so that excess water from one will flow into the other. The locations of these constructions indicate that the ancient engineers were aware of geological formations in the sites as well, and made effective use of them. Underground <b>conduits</b> have also been constructed to supply water to and from artificial ponds, {{such as in the}} Kuttam Pokuna and the ponds at Sigiriya.|$|E
