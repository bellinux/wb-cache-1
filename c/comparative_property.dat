Increasingly intricate transboundary institutional arrangements will need to be and are established. Lessons can be learned from frontrunners, but this requires a new method to establish similarities and differences in levels of(de) centralization. In this paper an institutional law & economics perspective on the study of legal regimes for integrated management of such complex, multi-use and multi-actor ecosystems will be presented. From this perspective a new method is developed {{that can be used for}} <b>comparative</b> <b>property</b> rights analysis. The method is based on the combined insights from property rights theory, institutional legal theory (ILT) and the work of the American legal theorist Hohfeld. The paper will show how the adapted Schlager & Ostrom framework can be used to better understand the institutional arrangements used to implement IWRM. The method has been implemented in a web-based database system. The method incorporates visualization of the legal regimes and a formal model to establish similarities and differences in levels of (de) centralization for different policy fields. For the graphical visualizations of the legal regimes Graphviz is used. The formal model is transposed into SQL-scripts that can be executed through the website.

Lawyers who handle transnational disputes and other matters concerning property will appreciate the explanation of specific terminology, application, and procedure. An introduction outlining the essential legal, cultural, and historical considerations affecting property is followed by a discussion of the various types of property. Further analysis describes how and to what extent legal subjects can have or obtain rights and interests in each type. The coverage includes tangible and intangible property, varying degrees of interest, and the various ways in which property is transferred, including the ramifications of appropriation, expropriation, and insolvency. Facts are presented {{in such a way that}} readers who are unfamiliar with specific terms and concepts in varying contexts will fully grasp their meaning and significance. The book includes ample references to doctrine and cases, as well as to relevant international treaties and conventions. Its succinct yet scholarly nature, as well as the practical quality of the information it provides, make this book a valuable time-saving tool for any practitioner faced with a property-related matter.

40|$|Ten years ago, {{the authors}} {{undertook}} a study, {{funded by the}} RICS Education Trust, to explore {{the ways in which}} investment decision-makers view <b>comparative</b> <b>property</b> choices. The study recognised that asset selection is undertaken in a complex environment, with multiple trade-offs necessary due to the different investment attributes represented in each property. The results indicated that, at that time, investors’ concerns about the sustainability of property were low, ranked as 7 th in importance out of 8 attributes. This raised concerns over the degree to which actors within the industry were embracing the sustainability agenda. The current project seeks to revisit these results, a decade later, to explore whether preferences and investment behaviour have changed as Government and RICS’ sustainability stances have become reinforced. This is a timely study, with three of the ten principles of the UN Global Compact focusing on the environment (RICS, 2015) and, furthermore, it responds to calls, {{at the time of the}} original publication, for a repeat investigation into behaviour post-crash. This paper presents the preliminary results of the study. The original methods are replicated – a simulation of complex stock selection choices (using choice-based-conjoint analysis) to reveal investors’ purchasing-decision behaviour – with the results subsequently further explored through focus groups to reveal the reasons for their simulated investment choices against their sustainability objectives. Thus, the research seeks to investigate and reveal the degree of accord between what investment decision-makers explicitly state their sustainability strategies to be and how they are implemented, against what their behaviour reveals about how purchasing decisions are made and the implicit judgments within...|$|E
40|$|Comparative legal {{research}} in property and urban planning law {{has taken an}} increasing interest in the policy patterns and legal arguments that municipal bodies and courts employ {{in the implementation of}} often radical urban reconfiguration. Aided by geographers, sociologists, and political economists, <b>comparative</b> <b>property</b> law scholars have begun to unearth the justificatory frameworks that underlie and shape these changes in metropolitan urban landscapes and that reveal an interplay between tangible and immediate modes of political constituencies’ interest navigation on the one hand, and deep-seated cultural-historical motivations as well as commitments to transnational strategic and political loyalties, on the other. These modes of research have worked to show how urban ‘local’ decisionmaking is embedded in complex and entangled policy considerations, which are expressed through the use of economically minded categories such as progress, modernization, growth, and development. The following Article focuses on the case of urban modernization policies pursued and implemented in one of the world’s largest metropolitan centers—India’s capital, Delhi—which {{is also one of the}} world’s global cities currently undergoing a radical and breathtaking transformation. Embarking on a micro-analysis of the justifications offered in the pursuit of a ‘cleaner,’ more ‘modern,’ and ‘competitive’ metropolis, this Article examines a series of judgments regarding the rights of urban slum residents. Particularly, the Article applies two analytical and conceptual lenses in studying the regulatory policies and the courts’ engagement with them, namely the political economy of development and the ideational and ideological concepts of ‘modernity’ and ‘neoliberalism. ’ The role of the judiciary in the allocation of property and urban space functions hereby as the site of engagement, the place where the regulatory fiat is approved or rejected, reinterpreted and reshaped, endorsed and concretized. Through this analysis, the Article seeks to provide a richer context for the way in which a number of key Indian courts, including the Indian Supreme Court, have become actively involved in regulatory municipal policies. The Article highlights and analyzes the devastating effects of the recent judicial pronouncements for those constituencies who have long been at the margins and whose legal protection threatens to be further besieged and mitigated in a largescale shift towards economic liberalization in the name of urban modernization and the city’s competitive enhancement...|$|E
40|$|In {{meeting the}} UK Government's {{national}} and international renewable energies commitments and their role in UK energy security, decarbonisation of energy use, carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation, the recognition of a potential for considerable scaling up of UK woodland coverage is emphasised. Also, UK forestry has increasingly become realigned with the global sustainability agenda encompassing issues such as native woodlands, the decline of woodland biodiversity, the Government’s quality of life indicators, and ideas of socio-cultural, ecological and economic landscape scale values. Accordingly, socio-cultural interaction {{with the natural world}} places structure and components into the landscape, the subsequent combinations of which are characterised by consequent ecological and economic conditions. As a consequence compositional, structural, spatial and temporal differences produce different value outcomes. This thesis explores these value outcomes illustrating the multi-dimensional nature of the relationships that society experience with their surrounding landscape, across a range of case study wood-fuel producing landscapes. The case study landscapes describe traditional silvo-pastoral management, Natura 2000 forest, primarily managed around ideas of ecosystem goods and services, co-operatively and commercially owned sustainable forestry. Differences in value are observed between and within landscapes, value domains and value components. These differences reflect tensions that exist between sustainability and society’s continued use of natural resources. Consequently value articulates the nature of relationships between and within multiple value components, characterised by competing socio-cultural, ecological, economic interests. Thus value, as a concept, is built through an understanding of the connected, embedded nature of society’s relationship with the natural world. Using a novel fuzzy logic modelling based approach to valuation, the consequences of land-use choices and the associated changes across socio-cultural, ecological and economic value domains are made visible. Understanding the complex nature of these interrelated and interdependent relationships can inform the political and institutional decision making and policy setting process. In this manner knowledge of interaction, interdependence and the reality of trade-offs, consistent with systems describe by finitude, can support and facilitate deliberative discourse. Where the true nature of value is considered an emergent property expressed through an appreciation of the value components and the outcomes of their relationships. Thus value is fundamentally a <b>comparative</b> <b>property</b> and not the outcome of an accumulative argument...|$|E

40|$|Consideration on formal {{structures}} {{of time and}} space mainly based on humanistic and social sciences is proposed in the study. The first part answers the question whether these formal structures are similar or different. The author supports the opinion that time possesses one formal structure while there are many different formal structures in the case of space. Time has a structure of complete succession by inclusion relation. It is verified not only by mensurable (or chronological) time, but also by structural (or operational) time. On the other hand, space is connected with so differentiated presentation ways, that it produces various configurations. It results from this, that formal structures with which abstract spaces are equiped, together with considered physical and human spaces are numerous and more or less strongly dependent on this whether metric spaces, topological spaces or graphs are concerned. A problem of supplementary nature towards the first one, and namely of <b>comparative</b> <b>properties</b> {{of time and space}}, introduced by their adequate formal structures, is discussed in the second part. The discussion concerns four main properties: direction, reversibility, homogeneity and continuity. Time direction is obvious while space direction refers to examination of isotropy properties. Irreversibility of time is visible for its reversibility, which is sustained sometimes, is a false problem. On the other hand, reversibility problem for space depends on symmetry properties, except directed and non-symmetrical graphs (condition of the lack of peripheries). While time is homogeneous, space is once homogeneous and once heterogeneous. Continuity is connected with the nature of time. In the case of space it depends on conditions of accessibility, and continuity notions in empirical meaning and in mathematical meaning are not similar, unless in some particular case. An opinion is underlined in the conclusion, that time is less abundant than space in proper formal structures and <b>comparative</b> <b>properties.</b> Digitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the <b>comparative</b> statics <b>properties</b> of the theory of the regulated firm. It is assumed that the firm either maximizes profit, subject to regulatory constraint, or maximizes revenue, subject to regulatory constraint and a profit constraint. The question asked in each case is whether there are <b>comparative</b> statics <b>properties</b> which distinguish effective from ineffective regulation. Several properties which do so are identified. In particular, the firm's derived demands are found to have some very striking properties. It is shown that if the regulatory constraint is effective, then at given output the firm's demand for capital decreases while its demand for labor increases with increases in the wage rate. These peculiar properties also occur in some cases when the regulatory constraint is not binding if revenue is maximized. However, there prove to be properties which conclusively distinguish revenue maximization from profit maximization. ...|$|R
