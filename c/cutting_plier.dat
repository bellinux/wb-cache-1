40|$|Cleaving {{crystals}} in {{a vacuum}} chamber is a simple method for obtaining atomically flat and clean surfaces for materials that have a preferential cleaving plane. Most in-situ cleavers use parallel cutting edges that are applied from two sides on the sample. We found in ambient experiments that diagonal cutting pliers, where the cleavage force is introduced in a single point instead of a line work very well also for hard materials. Here, we incorporate the diagonal <b>cutting</b> <b>plier</b> principle in a design compatible with ultra-high vacuum requirements. We show optical microscopy (mm scale) and atomic force microscopy (atomic scale) images of NiO(001) surfaces cleaved with this device.

40|$|This report {{outlines}} the procedures that {{were employed in}} fabricating prototype graphite-epoxy composite prop fan blades. These blades were used in wind tunnel tests that investigated prop fan propulsion system interactions with a missile airframe in order to study the feasibility of an advanced-technology-propfan-propelled missile. Major phases of the blade fabrication presented include machining of the master blade, mold fabrication, <b>ply</b> <b>cutting</b> and assembly, blade curing, and quality assurance. Specifically, four separate designs were fabricated, 18 blades of each geometry, using the same fabrication technique for each design...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{traditional}} two-dimensional (2 D) fibre preforms can {{be associated with}} poor out-of-plane and interlaminar mechanical performance, particularly in response to impact loads. Such preforms comprise multiple plies which necessitate labour-intensive <b>ply</b> <b>cutting</b> and assembly steps. 3 D woven textiles, due to the incorporation of through-thickness yarns, have been found to exhibit superior out-of-plane mechanical properties whilst simultaneously reducing ply-assembly time and cost (single-piece preform construction). Their delamination resistance and damage tolerance have been extensively investigated over the last number of years; however, there is a paucity of published work on their in-plane and out-of-plane mechanical properties when compared to their 2 D counterparts. Thus, this research details a comprehensive mechanical characterisation of an orthogonal 3 D woven composite in comparison with a suitable 2 D laminate. Composite panels have been manufactured with Henkel’s Loctite BZ 9130 benzoxazine resin by means of the EADS-patented vacuum assisted process (VAP®). In-plane compressive performance, impact damage resistance, damage tolerance, and out-of-plane tensile behaviour have been evaluated for both reinforcement architectures. Coupons were subjected to an energy level of 6 Joules per millimetre of laminate thickness by means of a drop-weight impact tower. Damage resistance was quantified as a function of impact damage area using penetrant-enhanced x-radiography (PEXR). Combined loading compression (CLC) tests were performed to complement compression after impact (CAI) testing which was conducted to evaluate the materials’ damage tolerance. Furthermore, out-of-plane tensile (OPT) testing has been performed on cruciform coupons using a novel test method. The experimental data revealed a 7. 5 % higher compressive strength for the 2 D material, which was expected due to the presence of crimp and yarn misalignments within the 3 D woven material. In contrast, the 3 D material performed better than the 2 D laminate for all other tests with 13 % lower damage area, 15. 5 % higher residual compressive strength and 36. 8 % higher mean out-of-plane tensile strength. It can thus be concluded that the incorporation of through-thickness yarn components can lead to significant improvements in damage resistance and tolerance by arresting the growth of delamination and limiting the growth of localised damage. Furthermore, when loaded in the out-of-plane direction, as with the OPT test configuration, much of the load is borne by the z-binder bundles rather than the much weaker fibre-matrix interface (as is the case with 2 D laminates), and consequently, the OPT strengths are higher in the 3 D woven composites. Limitations of this test method have been identified and recommendations for further development are presented in the concluding remarks...|$|R
