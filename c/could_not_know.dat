5|$|Wyatt {{said in his}} {{deposition}} afterward that he {{had been}} temporarily acting as city marshal for Virgil the week before while Virgil was in Tucson for the Pete Spence and Frank Stilwell trial. Wyatt said that he still considered himself a deputy city marshal, which Virgil later confirmed. Since Wyatt was an off-duty officer, he could not legally search or arrest Tom for carrying a revolver within the city limits-—a misdemeanor offense. Only Virgil or one of his city police deputies, including Morgan Earp and possibly Warren Earp, could search him and take any required action. Wyatt, a non-drinker, testified at the Spicer hearing that he went to Haffords and bought a cigar and went outside to watch the Cowboys. At the time of the gunfight about two hours later, Wyatt <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> if Tom was still armed.|$|E
25|$|Washington <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> {{that the}} British would not reopen {{hostilities}} after Yorktown. They still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston, and Savannah, {{together with a}} powerful fleet. The French army and navy departed, so the Americans were on their own in 1782–83. The treasury was empty, and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive, {{almost to the point}} of mutiny or possible coup d'état. The unrest among officers of the Newburgh Conspiracy was personally dispelled by Washington in 1783, and Congress subsequently created the promise of a five years bonus for all officers.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} the {{investigation}} were that the shooting spree was caused by a mental illness (chronic delusions similar to schizophrenia), and not a political agenda. Zavistonovičius held a gun for hunting since 1975. The permits were periodically renewed. As part of the renewal process, Zavistonovičius had to pass an examination by a psychiatrist. None of the psychiatrists who examined Zavistonovičius noticed anything suspicious, a fact which caused much controversy. During the investigation it was uncovered that in 1985, Zavistonovičius had been referred to and examined by the Vilnius Psychiatric Hospital. Zavistonovičius was married three times. The third wife separated from him just ten months before the shooting and described his morbid jealousy and persecutory delusions, even though neighbors saw him as an intelligent and helpful man. Relatives had begun noticing various symptoms since 1978, which may have been related to a car crash in 1976. In light of these findings, the prosecutor's office explored a possibility of charging with negligence the seven doctors who signed off on Zavistonovičius' gun permit. However, it was determined that the doctors were not negligent: without a centralized database, they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> that Zavistonovičius was treated at a psychiatric hospital, and in public his symptoms were masked and controlled well enough to pass the brief examination without suspicion.|$|E

25|$|But {{there is}} a {{peculiarity}} in Cousin's doctrine of activity or freedom, and in his doctrine of reason, which enters deeply into his system. This is the element of spontaneity in volition and in reason. This {{is the heart of}} what is new alike in his doctrine of knowledge and being. Liberty or freedom is a generic term which means a cause or being endowed with self-activity. This is to itself and its own development its own ultimate cause. Free-will is so, although it is preceded by deliberation and determination, i.e. reflection, for we are always conscious that even after determination we are free to will or not to will. But {{there is a}} primary kind of volition which has not reflection for its condition, which is yet free and spontaneous. We must have willed thus spontaneously first, otherwise we <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>know,</b> before our reflective volition, that we could will and act. Spontaneous volition is free as reflective, but it is the prior act of the two. This view of liberty of will is the only one in accordance with the facts of humanity; it excludes reflective volition, and explains the enthusiasm of the poet and the artist in the act of creation; it explains also the ordinary actions of mankind, which are done as a rule spontaneously and not after reflective deliberation.|$|E

As Sarah's grandfather Sir John Jennings had had twenty-two children, she had a multitude of cousins and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> them all.

2500|$|Due to {{its early}} date of composition, Curtain {{makes no mention}} of Poirot's later cases, in novels {{published}} after World War II.

Christie <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> how long she would live nor how popular Poirot would remain. See Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple for further discussion of her views of Poirot. The fifth paragraph in Curtain ("Wounded in the war that for me would always be the war—the war that was wiped out now by a second and more desperate war" [...] says Hastings) marks the passing of time for Hastings, and the long friendship of the two men, as well as making a link to the first Poirot novel.|$|E

[...] At first blush, the Court conceded, this rule appeared easily administrable by police officers, which would serve the government's interest in rules {{that are easy to}} apply on the spot. [...] But in thinking through many possible applications of the rule Atwater proposed, the Court found it more difficult to apply. [...] Court opinion stated that it is not reasonable to expect the average police officer to know the details of [...] "frequently complex penalty schemes," [...] especially since the penalty associated with seemingly identical conduct can vary with the facts that are difficult to discern at the scene of a crime, such as whether the suspect is a repeat offender or the weight of drugs.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s {{a new theory}} of appeasement, {{sometimes}} called [...] "counter-revisionist", emerged as historians argued that appeasement was probably the only choice for the British government in the 1930s, {{but that it was}} poorly implemented, carried out too late and not enforced strongly enough to constrain Hitler. Appeasement was considered a viable policy, considering the strains that the British Empire faced in recuperating from World War I, and Chamberlain was said to have adopted a policy suitable to Britain's cultural and political needs. Frank McDonough is a leading proponent of this view of appeasement and describes his book Neville Chamberlain, Appeasement and the British Road to War as a [...] "post revisionist" [...] study. Appeasement was a crisis management strategy seeking a peaceful settlement of Hitler's grievances. [...] "Chamberlain's worst error", says McDonough, [...] "was to believe that he could march Hitler on the yellow brick road to peace when in reality Hitler was marching very firmly on the road to war." [...] He has criticized revisionist historians for concentrating on Chamberlain's motivations rather than how appeasement worked in practice – as a [...] "usable policy" [...] to deal with Hitler. James P. Levy argues against the outright condemnation of appeasement. [...] "Knowing what Hitler did later," [...] he writes, [...] "the critics of Appeasement condemn the men who tried to keep the peace in the 1930s, men who <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> what would come later. ... The political leaders responsible for Appeasement made many errors. They were not blameless. But what they attempted was logical, rational, and humane." ...|$|E
