50|$|A {{hypersonic}} {{wind tunnel}} {{is designed to}} generate a hypersonic flow field in the working section, thus simulating the typical flow features of this flow regime - including compression shocks and pronounced boundary layer effects, entropy layer and viscous interaction zones and most importantly high total temperatures of the flow. The speed of these tunnels vary from Mach 5 to 15. The power requirement of a wind tunnel increases with the cross section, the flow density and is directly proportional to the third power of the test velocity. Hence installation of a continuous, <b>closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> remains a costly affair. The first continuous Mach 7-10 wind tunnel with 1x1 m test section was planned at Kochel am See, Germany during WW II and finally put into operation as 'Tunnel A' in the late 1950s at AEDC Tullahoma, TN, USA for an installed power of 57 MW. In view of these high facility demands, also intermittently operated experimental facilities like blow-down wind tunnels are designed and installed to simulate the hypersonic flow. A hypersonic wind tunnel comprises in flow direction the main components: heater/cooler arrangements, dryer, convergent/divergent nozzle, test section, second throat and diffuser. A blow-down wind tunnel has a low vacuum reservoir at the back end, while a continuously operated, <b>closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> has a high power compressor installation instead. Since the temperature drops with the expanding flow, the air inside the test section has the chance of becoming liquefied. For that reason, preheating is particularly critical (the nozzle may require cooling).|$|E

40|$|The {{transitional}} intermittency is {{describing the}} flow development along {{the surface in}} stream wise direction {{during the process of}} laminar / turbulent transition. It relates to the generation and propagation of turbulent spots. The transitional intermittency factor () xγ {{is one of the key}} parameters in recognition of the transitional boundary layer state. This factor computed by means of direct method is defined as time ratio of turbulent flow occurrence time over whole measurement time. Direct method of determination of the intermittency factor is very effective in detecting the start and the end of transition with proper choice of parameters for signal processing and analysis. A lot of methods of determination γ is available [1] but only the TERA (Turbulent Energy Recognition Algorithm) method [2] was chosen in this case.

40|$|The {{design of}} <b>closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> has {{historically}} been performed using rule of thumb which have evolved over the years into a body of useful guidelines. The development of indraft <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels,</b> however, {{has not been as}} well documented. The design of indraft <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> is therefore generally performed using a more intuitive approach, often resulting in a facility with disappointing flow quality. The primary problem is a lack of understanding of the flow in the inlet as it passes through the required antiturbulence treatment. For <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> which employ large contraction ratio inlets, this lack of understanding is not serious since the relatively low velocity of the flow through the inlet treatment reduces the sensitivity to improper inlet design. When designing a small contraction ratio inlet, much more careful design is needed {{in order to reduce the}} flow distortions generated by the inlet treatment. As part of the National Full Scale Aerodynamics Complex Modification Project, 2 -D computational methods were developed which account for the effect of both inlet screens and guide vanes on the test section velocity distribution. Comparisons with experimental data are presented which indicate that the methods accurately compute the flow distortions generated by a screen in a nonuniform velocity field. The use of inlet guide vanes to eliminate the screen induced distortion is also demonstrated both computationally and experimentally.

It is observed that the side ratio of buildings significantly affects the wind pressures on leeward and sidewalls, whereas wind pressure on windward wall is almost independent of side ratio. Further, the wind incidence angles and side ratio of the buildings significantly affect its mean displacements as well as torque.|$|E
40|$|Using Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations, {{the flow}} in the new University of Sydney <b>closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> has been {{analyzed}} prior {{to the construction of}} the tunnel. The objective was to obtain a uniform {{flow in the}} test section of the wind tunnel while keeping the pressure losses over the tunnel as low as possible. This was achieved by using several flow-improving components such as guide vanes, screens, a honeycomb and a settling chamber. The guide vanes were used in the corners and in the diverging part leading into the settling chamber, giving a significant improvement of the flow as they prevent it from taking undesired paths. The settling chamber is used to decelerate the flow before it is accelerated when leaving the settling chamber, a process which reduces the turbulence in the flow. Screens were used in the settling chamber to further improve the flow by imposing a pressure drop which evens out differences in the flow speed and reduces the turbulence. The honeycomb, which is situated in the end of the settling chamber, makes the flow more uniform by forcing it to go in only one direction. A uniform flow was obtained using three screens and one honeycomb together with the guide vanes and the settling chamber...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{results of}} the {{experimental}} study into the damping of flexural vibrations in turbofan blades with trailing edges tapered according to a power-law profile are reported. Trailing edges of power-law profile (wedges), with small pieces of attached absorbing layers, materialise one-dimensional acoustic black holes for flexural waves that can absorb {{a large proportion of}} the incident flexural wave energy. The experiments were carried out on four model blades made of aluminium. Two of them were twisted, so that a more realistic fan blade could be considered. All model blades, the ones with tapered trailing edges and the ones of traditional form, were excited by an electromagnetic shaker, and the corresponding frequency response functions have been measured. The results show that the resonant peaks are reduced substantially once a power-law tapering is introduced to the blade.

An emphasis is placed on the effect each airfoil shape parameter has on the overall airfoil performance and the effect of the interdependence of each shape parameter. Maximum coefficient of lift, stall angle of attack, maximum coefficient of lift/coefficient of drag and the angle of attack at which it occurs are found for a variety of thin/cambered/reflexed airfoils and a number of correlations between changes in shape parameters and airfoil performance are established. Changes in C and xC cause a 40 % variation of Cl,max and 40 % variation of astall. Changes in R and xR cause a 15 % variation of Cl,max with no significant variation in astall.

40|$|The flow around {{three-dimensional}} aircraft wings, including delta-wings is very complicated. Much {{experimental and}} numerical {{work has been}} performed to discover its complexity. To date, all numerical calculations on delta wings {{have been carried out}} for either fully laminar or fully turbulent boundary layers. The transition status of the boundary layer is considered unknown despite several efforts to identify transition from laminar to turbulent flow. One such study, called the International Vortex Flow Experiment – 2 (VFE- 2), has been carried out by an international group and mainly focuses on the boundary layers on delta wings. The data from the VFE- 2 experimentals potentially provide the location of transition on the upper and lower surfaces of the wing to guide associated numerical studies. The effects of Reynolds number, Mach number, angle of attack and the leading edge bluntness are also investigated. Almost all delta wing studies to date have involved tests on wings with sharp leading edges and these have led {{to the conclusion that the}} flows are relatively independent of Reynolds number. In fact, most real wings have finite leading edge radii. Hence, the flow separation is no longer fixed at the leading edge, thus making the flow dependent on Reynolds number. This particular aspect has been studied extensively by the VFE- 2 team. As part of the VFE- 2 project, Glasgow University constructed a delta wing with four different sets of leading edges. Small-, medium- and large-radius edges and a pair of sharp leading edges were constructed in order to compare results from four delta wing configurations. In the current study experiments were carried out on these wings in the 2. 65 metre by 2. 04 metre, <b>closed</b> <b>circuit,</b> Argyll <b>Wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> of Glasgow University. The models were mounted on a specially designed sting support structure that allowed them to be pitched around a constant centre of rotation throughout the experiments. Tests were conducted at speeds of 20. 63 m/s and 41. 23 m/s representing Reynolds numbers of 1 x 106 & 2 x 106 respectively, based on the mean aerodynamic chords of the wings. The tests were conducted in three phases. In the first phase, steady and unsteady forces and moments on all wings were measured at an angle of attack that varied from α = 100 to 250. The forces and moments were captured at two sampling rates; i. e., 100 Hz and 8000 Hz. The second test series captured flow visualization data on the four wings. In these experiments, a mixture of Ondina oil and paraffin was combined with Dayglo powder and applied to the surfaces of the delta wings. The images of the flow topology on the wings were recorded. The final series of experiments involved Particle Image Velocimetry measurements. A stereo-PIV arrangement was applied in this experiment and two CCD-Cameras were positioned outside the test section for image capture. The current study has identified interesting features of the interrelationship between the conventional leading edge primary vortex and the occurrence and development of the inner vortex on the round-edged delta wings. The inner vortex was first identified and verified by the VFE- 2 team. The effects of Reynolds number, angle of attack and leading-edge radii on both vortices are discussed in detail. The steady balance data have shown that the normal force coefficients are sensitive to leading edge bluntness at moderate angles of attack but are less so at high angles of attack. In relation to this, the flow visualization images have also shown that the primary vortex origin is located further aft on the wing at higher leading edge bluntness. This impacts on the strength of the inner vortex which remains a significant flow feature until the primary vortex approaches the apex. The lateral extent of the inner vortex is very dependent on the primary vortex at the leading edge; i. e. the weakening of the primary vortex has positive effects on the inner vortex. Particle Image Velocimetry shows that the increase in leading edge bluntness significantly decreases the swirl magnitude of the primary vortex. The results obtained from the current investigation provide considerable insight into the effects of Reynolds number, angle of attack and bluntness on the flow structures experienced by delta wings, with rounded leading edges.

Trailing edges of power-law profile (wedges), with small pieces of attached absorbing layers, materialise one-dimensional acoustic black holes for flexural waves that can absorb {{a large proportion of}} the incident flexural wave energy. The experiments were carried out on four model blades made of aluminium. Two of them were twisted, so that a more realistic fan blade could be considered. All model blades, the ones with tapered trailing edges and the ones of traditional form, were excited by an electromagnetic shaker, and the corresponding frequency response functions have been measured. The results show that the resonant peaks are reduced substantially once a power-law tapering is introduced to the blade. An initial study into the aerodynamic implications of this method has been carried out as well, using measurements in a <b>closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel.</b> In particular, the effects of the trailing edge of power-law profile on the airflow-excited vibrations of the fan blades have been investigated. It has been demonstrated that trailing edges of power-law profile with appropriate damping layers are efficient in reduction of the airflow-excited vibrations of the fan blades. The obtained results demonstrate that power-law tapering of trailing edges of turbofan blades can be a viable method of reduction of blade vibrations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} validation of a measurement system for aerodynamic characteristics of unmanned aerial vehicles. An aerodynamic balance was designed {{in order to measure}} the lift, drag forces and pitching moment for different airfoils. During the design process, several aspects were analyzed in order to produce an efficient design, for instance the range of changes of the angle of attack with and a small increment and the versatility of being adapted to different type of airfoils, since it is a wire balance it was aligned and calibrated as well. Wind tunnel tests of a two dimensional NACA four digits family airfoil and four different modifications of this airfoil were performed to validate the aerodynamic measurement system. The modification of this airfoil was made {{in order to create a}} blowing outlet with the shape of a step on the suction surface. Therefore, four different locations along the cord line for this blowing outlet were analyzed. This analysis involved the aerodynamic performance which meant obtaining lift, drag and pitching moment coefficients curves as a function of the angle of attack experimentally for the situation where the engine of the aerial vehicle is turned off, called the no blowing condition, by means of wind tunnel tests. The experiments were performed in a <b>closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> with an open test section. Finally, results of the wind tunnel tests were compared with numerical results obtained by means of computational fluid dynamics as well as with other experimental references and found to be in good agreement...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAircraft {{wings are}} the lifting {{surfaces}} with the chosen aerofoil sections. The efficiency {{as well as}} the performance of an aircraft mostly depends on the aerodynamic characteristics e. g. lift, drag, lift to drag ratio, etc of wings. Besides many factors, the effects of wing shape are also crucial to aircraft performance. This paper represents the experimental investigation to explore better aerodynamic performance by incorporating curvature at the leading edge of a wing. A wooden model with straight leading and trailing edge i. e. rectangular planform and another model with curved leading edge and straight trailing edge are prepared with NACA 4412 aerofoil in equal length (span) and surface area. Both the models are tested in a <b>closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> at air speed of 85. 35 kph (0. 07 Mach) i. e. at Reynold's number 1. 82 × 105. The static pressure at different angles of attack (- 4 °, 0 °, 4 °, 8 °, 12 °, 16 °, 20 ° & 24 °) are measured from both upper and lower surfaces of the wing models through different pressure tapings by using a multi-tube water manometer. From the static pressure distribution, lift coefficient, drag coefficient and lift to drag ratio of both the models are analyzed. After analyzing the data, it is found that the curved leading edge wing planform is having higher lift coefficient and lower drag coefficient than the rectangular wing planform. Thus, the curved leading edge planform is having higher lift to drag ratio than the rectangular planform...|$|E
