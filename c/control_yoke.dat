5|$|Sud-Est's design bureau, {{while working}} on the Sud Aviation Caravelle in 1953, {{licensed}} several design features from de Havilland, building on previous collaborations on earlier licensed designs, including the DH 100 Vampire; the nose and cockpit layout of the Comet 1 was grafted onto the Caravelle. In 1969, when the Comet 4's design was modified by Hawker Siddeley to become {{the basis for the}} Nimrod, the cockpit layout was completely redesigned and bore little resemblance to its predecessors except for the <b>control</b> <b>yoke.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 767 was {{the first}} Boeing {{wide-body}} to be designed with a two-crew digital glass cockpit. Cathode ray tube (CRT) color displays and new electronics replaced {{the role of the}} flight engineer by enabling the pilot and co-pilot to monitor aircraft systems directly. Despite the promise of reduced crew costs, United Airlines initially demanded a conventional three-person cockpit, citing concerns about the risks associated with introducing a new aircraft. The carrier maintained this position until July 1981, when a US presidential task force determined that a crew of two was safe for operating wide-body jets. A three-crew cockpit remained as an option and was fitted to the first production models. Ansett Australia ordered 767s with three-crew cockpits due to union demands; it was the only airline to operate 767s so configured. The 767's two-crew cockpit was also applied to the 757, allowing pilots to operate both aircraft after a short conversion course, and adding incentive for airlines to purchase both types. Although nominally similar in control design, flying the 767 feels different from the 757. The 757's controls are heavy, similar to the 727 and 747; the <b>control</b> <b>yoke</b> can be rotated to 90 degrees in each direction. The 767 has far lighter control feel in pitch and roll, and the <b>control</b> <b>yoke</b> has approximately 2/3 the rotation travel.|$|E
5|$|The A330 {{shares the}} same glass cockpit flight deck layout as the A320 and A340, {{featuring}} electronic instrument displays rather than mechanical gauges. Instead {{of a conventional}} <b>control</b> <b>yoke,</b> the flight deck features side-stick controls, six main displays, and the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS), which covers navigation and flight displays, {{as well as the}} Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). Apart from the flight deck, the A330 also has the fly-by-wire system common to the A320 family, the A340, the A350, and the A380. It also features three primary and two secondary flight control systems, as well as a flight envelope limit protection system which prevents manoeuvres from exceeding the aircraft's aerodynamic and structural limits.|$|E

25|$|The primary flight {{controls}} are intrinsically safe. In {{the event of}} total hydraulic system failure or double engine failure, they will automatically and seamlessly revert to control via servo tab. In this mode, the servo tabs aerodynamically control the elevators and ailerons; these servo tabs are in turn controlled by cables running to the <b>control</b> <b>yoke.</b> The pilot's muscle forces alone control the tabs. For the 737 Next Generation, a six-screen LCD glass cockpit with modern avionics was implemented while retaining crew commonality with previous generation 737.|$|E

25|$|Reading the <b>control</b> <b>yoke</b> {{data from}} the FDR {{revealed}} that the pilots made a crucial error by pulling back on the <b>control</b> <b>yoke</b> throughout the dive with the stick-shaker audible on the CVR from {{the onset of the}} dive. This raised the aircraft's angle of attack, removed all aileron authority, prevented recovery from the roll induced by the rudder, and caused an aerodynamic stall. Because the aircraft had entered a slip, pulling back on the yoke only aggravated the bank angle further. Boeing's test pilots reenacted the fatal dive in both a simulator, as well as a test 737-300 by flying the same parameters on the accident FDR, and found that recovery from a fully deflected rudder at level flight, while at 190 knot crossover speed, was accomplished by turning the wheel to the opposite direction of the roll, and not pulling back on the yoke to regain aileron authority. The NTSB remarked that no airline had ever trained a pilot on the proper recovery technique for the situation experienced by the pilots and that the pilots had just 10 seconds from the onset of the roll to troubleshoot before recovery of the aircraft was impossible. The FDR revealed that after the aircraft stalled, it along with the crew and passengers were subjected up to a 4g load throughout the dive until impact with the ground in an 80 degree nose-down attitude traveling at approximately 300mph under significant sideslip.|$|E
25|$|Aboard the Boeing, {{the crew}} was {{preparing}} for arrival at JFK International, flying in clear air above an overcast sky with good visibility as they approached Carmel. The aircraft was being flown on autopilot with altitude-hold engaged, and the pilot, Capt. Thomas H. Carroll, had his left hand on the <b>control</b> <b>yoke.</b> On seeing an aircraft at his 10 o'clock position on {{what appeared to be}} a collision course, he immediately disengaged the autopilot, put the wheel hard over to the right, and pulled back on the yoke. His copilot, First Officer Leo M. Smith, also grabbed the controls and acted together with him. The aircraft rolled to the right and it became apparent that this maneuver would not allow the two aircraft to pass clear of each other, so Carroll and Smith attempted to reverse the wheel to the left and pushed on the yoke. Before the aircraft could react to the control reversal, two shocks were felt and the Boeing entered a steep dive; the Boeing's left wing had struck the tail of the Constellation and both aircraft were out of control.|$|E
500|$|B-52s {{prior to}} the G models had very small ailerons with a short span that was {{approximately}} equal to their chord. These [...] "feeler ailerons" [...] were used to provide feedback forces to the pilot's <b>control</b> <b>yoke</b> and to fine tune the roll axes during delicate maneuvers such as aerial refueling. Due to twisting of the thin main wing, conventional outboard flap type ailerons would lose authority and therefore could not be used. In other words, aileron activation would cause the wing to twist, undermining roll control. Six spoilerons on each wing {{are responsible for the}} majority of roll control. The late B-52G models eliminated the ailerons altogether and added an extra spoileron to each wing. Partly {{because of the lack of}} ailerons, the B-52G and H models were more susceptible to dutch roll.|$|E
50|$|In the cockpit, all Cherokees use <b>control</b> <b>yokes</b> {{rather than}} sticks, {{together}} with rudder pedals. The pilot operates the flaps manually using a Johnson bar located between the front seats: for zero degrees the lever is {{flat against the}} floor and is pulled up to select the detent positions of 10°, 25° and 40°.|$|R

5|$|In {{designing}} the 777 {{as its first}} fly-by-wire commercial aircraft, Boeing decided to retain conventional <b>control</b> <b>yokes</b> rather than change to sidestick controllers as used in many fly-by-wire fighter aircraft and in many Airbus airliners. Along with traditional <b>yoke</b> and rudder <b>controls,</b> the cockpit features a simplified layout that retains similarities to previous Boeing models. The fly-by-wire system also incorporates flight envelope protection, a system that guides pilot inputs within a computer-calculated framework of operating parameters, acting to prevent stalls, overspeeds, and excessively stressful maneuvers. This system can be overridden by the pilot if deemed necessary. The fly-by-wire system is supplemented by mechanical backup.|$|R
2500|$|... a <b>control</b> <b>yoke</b> (also {{known as}} a control column), centre stick or side-stick (the latter two also colloquially {{known as a}} control or joystick), governs the aircraft's roll and pitch by moving the ailerons (or {{activating}} wing warping on some very early aircraft designs) when turned or deflected left and right, and moves the elevators when moved backwards or forwards ...|$|E
2500|$|Bossi’s human-powered aircraft, {{named the}} Pedaliante, {{utilized}} conventional glider configuration and construction. The high-winged streamlined monoplane design featured two laminated balsa wood propellers – each approximately [...] in diameter. The control surfaces {{consisted of a}} conventional rear rudder, elevator, {{and a pair of}} roll spoilers on the wings – all activated by a divided <b>control</b> <b>yoke.</b> The pilot sat semi-upright, and a bicycle chain transmitted the power from the pedals to an overhead transverse shaft that was bevel-geared to the two propellers, which extended from the wing {{on each side of the}} fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|The Alon A-2 and A-2A Aircoupes {{featured}} a sliding canopy, a Continental C90 [...] engine, separate bucket seats and an improved instrument panel. The A-2 also differed from earlier two-control models in having limited-movement rudder pedals. This {{was done in}} order to make it a more acceptable training aircraft and to make it easier to counteract increased P-factor yaw during a climb from the more powerful engine. Nosewheel steering was no longer interlinked with the <b>control</b> <b>yoke,</b> and was changed to the more common practice of being interlinked with the rudder pedals( [...] this was the same system that was installed in the Forney F-1A). The older two axes control system was offered as an option. The single control (non-differential) wheel brakes remained. The airplane had a higher rate of climb, a higher speed for best climb rate, and better engine cooling. Its non-spinning characteristics remained unchanged.|$|E
25|$|The <b>control</b> <b>yokes</b> also {{vary greatly}} amongst aircraft. There are yokes where roll is {{controlled}} by rotating the yoke clockwise/counterclockwise (like steering a car) and pitch {{is controlled by}} tilting the control column towards you or away from you, but in others the pitch is controlled by sliding the yoke {{into and out of}} the instrument panel (like most Cessnas, such as the 152 and 172), and in some the roll is controlled by sliding the whole yoke to the left and right (like the Cessna 162). Centre sticks also vary between aircraft. Some are directly connected to the control surfaces using cables, others (fly-by-wire airplanes) have a computer in between which then controls the electrical actuators.|$|R

2500|$|Both the CVR and FDR were {{recovered}} {{and used for}} the investigation. Due to the limited parameters recorded by the FDR, investigators did {{not have access to}} the position of the flight-control surfaces (rudder, ailerons, elevator, etc.) for the accident. However, two parameters recorded by the FDR were crucial, one being the aircraft's heading, the other being the pitch <b>control</b> <b>yoke</b> position. During the approach, Flight 427 encountered wake turbulence from Delta 1083; the FAA, however, determined [...] "the wake vortex encounter alone would not have caused the continued heading change that occurred after 1903:00." [...] The abrupt heading change shortly before the dive pointed investigators immediately to the rudder. Due to the absence of rudder pedal positions from the data, investigators had to determine whether the rudder moved hard-over by a malfunction or by pilot command. This in turn led to the CVR being more heavily scrutinized than most other recordings as statements and breathing from the pilots could potentially tell investigators if they were fighting for control over a rudder malfunction or inadvertently stomped on the wrong rudder pedal in excitement from the wake-turbulence. Boeing felt the latter more likely, while USAir and the Pilot's Union felt the former was more likely.|$|E
2500|$|By November 1941, many of {{the initial}} assembly-line {{challenges}} had been met, which freed up time for the engineering team to tackle the problem of frozen controls in a dive. Lockheed had a few ideas for tests that would help them find an answer. The first solution tried was the fitting of spring-loaded servo tabs on the elevator trailing edge designed to aid the pilot when <b>control</b> <b>yoke</b> forces rose over , {{as would be expected}} in a high-speed dive. At that point, the tabs would begin to multiply the effort of the pilot's actions. The expert test pilot, 43-year-old Ralph Virden, was given a specific high-altitude test sequence to follow and was told to restrict his speed and fast maneuvering in denser air at low altitudes, since the new mechanism could exert tremendous leverage under those conditions. A note was taped to the instrument panel of the test craft underscoring this instruction. On 4 November 1941, Virden climbed into YP-38 #1 and completed the test sequence successfully, but 15 minutes later was seen in a steep dive followed by a high-G pullout. The tail unit of the aircraft failed at about [...] during the high-speed dive recovery; Virden was killed in the subsequent crash. The Lockheed design office was justifiably upset, but their design engineers could only conclude that servo tabs were not the solution for loss of control in a dive. Lockheed still had to find the problem; the Army Air Forces personnel were sure it was flutter and ordered Lockheed to look more closely at the tail.|$|E
5000|$|The Thompson {{constant}} velocity joint (TCVJ), {{also known as a}} Thompson coupling, assembles two cardan joints within each other to eliminate the intermediate shaft. A <b>control</b> <b>yoke</b> is added to keep the input and output shafts aligned. The <b>control</b> <b>yoke</b> uses a spherical pantograph scissor mechanism to bisect the angle between the input and output shafts and to maintain the joints at a relative phase angle of zero. The alignment ensures constant angular velocity at all joint angles. Eliminating the intermediate shaft and keeping the input shafts aligned in the homokinetic plane greatly reduces the induced shear stresses and vibration inherent in double cardan shafts. While the geometric configuration does not maintain {{constant velocity}} for the <b>control</b> <b>yoke</b> that aligns the cardan joints, the <b>control</b> <b>yoke</b> has minimal inertia and generates little vibration. Continuous use of a standard Thompson coupling at a straight-through, zero-degree angle will cause excessive wear and damage to the joint; a minimum offset of 2 degrees between the input and output shafts is needed to reduce <b>control</b> <b>yoke</b> wear. Modifying the input and output yokes so that they are not precisely normal to their respective shafts can alter or eliminate the [...] "disallowed" [...] angles.|$|E
