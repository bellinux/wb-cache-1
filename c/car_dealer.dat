5|$|Clements had {{supported}} Bert T. Combs for governor against Chandler in 1955, {{and did so}} again against Harry Lee Waterfield in 1959. Combs defeated Waterfield and rewarded Clements by appointing him state highway commissioner. In 1961, Clements and Combs split over a proposed deal to lease dump trucks from a Louisville <b>car</b> <b>dealer.</b> State newspapers charged that the deal was payback to the dealer, a Combs supporter. When Combs canceled the deal Clements {{took it as a}} public rebuke and soon after resigned to work on the presidential campaign of his friend, Lyndon Johnson. Following his split with Combs, Clements allied himself with the Chandler faction, opposing Combs' lieutenant governor, Wilson Wyatt in his bid to unseat Senator Thruston Morton. Clements' influence declined rapidly after the split with Combs, and by the 1963 gubernatorial race, he was unable to deliver his home county for Chandler in the primary against Edward T. Breathitt. Clements died in his hometown of Morganfield, Kentucky on March 12, 1985.|$|E

Shehri was born in Annams, and grew up in the Um Saraar {{neighborhood}} in Khamis Mushait. He had ten brothers and one sister.

Some of Wail al-Shehri's elder brothers had visited the United States and could speak English; however, Wail knew little English.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The aim of {{the study}} was to know how <b>car</b> <b>dealers</b> view the <b>car</b> market in Mauritius and what are their {{opinions}} and attitudes towards the introduction of the hybrid car in the economy. Design/methodology/approach - After conducting a thorough literature review, a descriptive research design was adopted to carry out a quantitative study. The methodology used in this study consisted of a survey carried out amongst <b>car</b> <b>dealers</b> in Mauritius. There were 59 authorized <b>car</b> <b>dealers</b> for second hand <b>cars</b> and 14 <b>dealers</b> of brand new cars in Mauritius at the time the study was performed and personal interviews were held with all the <b>car</b> <b>dealers.</b> The data were collected and analysed using SPSS. Findings - The <b>car</b> <b>dealers</b> expressed their optimism regarding the many benefits consumers will gain from hybrid cars given the soaring prices of fuel these days but thought the car was affordable to only a minority of the customer market. They also thought the government and politicians would be the key players to promote any new technology. Originality/value - The contribution of this study is that it surveyed car dealers’ views regarding the introduction of the hybrid car in a developing country. It can be a valuable study for Mauritius and other countries which have not yet introduced the new technology locally. Moreover, there are few academic papers on the marketing of the hybrid car and this study thus hopes to contribute to the scanty literature...|$|R
