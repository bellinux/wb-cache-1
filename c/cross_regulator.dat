40|$|Like in many {{emerging}} {{and least}} developed countries, agriculture {{is vital for}} Pakistan’s national economy. It contributes 21 % to the annual gross domestic product (GDP), engages 44 % of total labour force and contributes 60 % to the national export. Pakistan has a total area of 80 Mha (million hectares) with 22 Mha arable land, out of which 17 Mha is under irrigation, mostly under canal irrigation. Due to the arid to semi-arid climate, the irrigation is predominantly necessary for successful crop husbandry in Pakistan. The development of modern irrigation in Indo-Pakistan started in 1859 {{with the construction of}} the Upper Bari Doab Canal on Ravi River and {{with the passage of time}} the irrigation system of Pakistan grew up to the world’s largest contiguous gravity flow irrigation system, known as the Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS). In the IBIS almost all irrigation canals are directly fed from rivers, while river flows carry heavy sediment loads. Irrigation canals receiving such flows get massive amounts of sediments, which are then deposited in the irrigation canals depending upon the hydrodynamic conditions of the canals. Sediment deposition in irrigation canals causes serious operation and maintenance problems. Studies reveal that silt reduces up to 40 % of the available discharge in irrigation canals. Researchers have been striving since long to manage this problem in a sustainable way and a number of approaches have been introduced in this connection. As a first step sediments are controlled at river intakes by silt excluders and ejectors. Then a canal design approach is adopted for keeping sediments in suspension and to distribute them as much as possible on the irrigated fields. Even then sediments tend to deposit in irrigation canals and become a serious problem in canal operation and maintenance, which then requires frequent desilting campaigns to keep water in the canals running. It causes a continuous burden on the national economy. In emerging and least developed countries, adequate and timely availability of funds for operation and maintenance is generally a problem. It causes delays in canal maintenance, which affects their hydraulic performance. Water is then delivered inadequately and inequitably to the water users. The story becomes further complicated when it comes to downstream controlled demand based irrigation canals under flexible operation. In fixed supply based operation, canals always run at full supply discharge and such operation, generally, does not allow sediment deposition in the canal prism due to sufficient velocities. Whereas in demand based flexible operation the canals cannot run always at full supply discharge but instead the discharge is changing depending upon the crop water requirement in the canal command area. Such type of canal operation is not always favourable to sediment transport as under low discharges, flow velocities fall quite low and hence sediment deposition may occur in the canal prism. The questions arise here what sort of hydrodynamic relationships prevent sediment deposition in downstream controlled irrigation canals and how these relationships can be adopted, while catering crop water requirements of the command area? How the maintenance needs can be minimized by managing sediment transport through better canal operation? This study has been designed to investigate such type of relationships and practices in order to manage sediment transport in downstream controlled demand based irrigation canals and to attain maximum hydraulic efficiency with minimum maintenance needs. The hypothesis of the study states that in demand based irrigation canals the volume of silt deposition can be minimized and even the sediments which deposit during low crop water requirement periods can be re-entrained during peak water requirement periods. In this way a balance can be maintained in sediment deposition and re-entrainment by adequate canal operation. Two computer models have been used in this study, namely, Simulation of Irrigation Canals (SIC) and SEdiment TRansport in Irrigation Canals (SETRIC). Both models are one-dimensional and are capable of simulating steady and unsteady state flows (SETRIC only steady state flows) and non equilibrium sediment transport in irrigation canals. The SIC model has the capability to simulate sediment transport under unsteady flow conditions and can assess the effect of sediment deposition on hydraulic performance of irrigation canals. Whereas the SETRIC model has the advantage of taking into account the development of bed forms and their effect on resistance to flow, which is the critical factor in irrigation canal design and management. In the SETRIC model, a new module regarding sediment transport simulations in downstream controlled irrigation canals has been incorporated. The study has been conducted on the Upper Swat Canal – Pehure High Level Canal (USC-PHLC) Irrigation System, which consists of three canals, Machai Branch Canal, PHLC and Maira Branch Canal. The Machai Branch Canal has upstream controlled supply based operation and the two other canals have downstream controlled demand based operation respectively. These canals are interconnected. The PHLC and Machai Branch canals feed Maira Branch Canal as well having their own irrigation systems. PHLC receives water from Tarbela Reservoir and Machai Branch Canal from the Swat River through USC. Water from Tarbela Reservoir, at present, is sediment free, whereas the water from Swat River is sediment laden. However, various studies have indicated that soon Tarbela Reservoir will be filled with sediments and will behave as run of the river system. Then PHLC will also receive sediment laden flows. The design discharges of Machai, PHLC and Maira Branch canals are 65, 28 and 27 m 3 /s respectively. The command area of the USC-PHLC Irrigation System is 115, 800 ha. The USC-PHLC Irrigation System has been remodelled recently and water allowance has been increased from 0. 34 l/s/h to 0. 67 l/s/h. The upper USC system, from Machai Branch head to RD 242 (a control structure from where the downstream control system starts), was remodelled in 1995, whereas the system downstream of RD 242 was remodelled in 2003. The upper part of Machai Branch Canal up to an abscissa of about 74, 000 m is under fixed supply based operation, whereas the lower part of Machai Branch Canal, Maira Branch Canal and the PHLC are under semi-demand based flexible operation. The semi-demand based system is operated according to crop water requirements and follows a Crop Based Irrigation Operations (CBIO) schedule. When the crop water demand falls below 80 % of the full supply discharge, a rotation system is introduced among the secondary offtakes. During very low crop water requirement periods the supplies are not reduced beyond a minimum limit of 50 % of the full supply discharge because of the canal operation rule. The study consisted of fieldwork of two years in which daily canal operation data, monthly sediment inflow data in low sediment periods and weekly sediment data in peak concentration periods were collected. Three mass balance studies were conducted in which all the water and sediment inflows and outflows were measured with suspended sediment sampling at selected locations along the canal and boil sampling at the offtaking canals, immediately downstream of the head regulators. Further in the four months during the peak sediment season June, July, August and September, mass balance studies were conducted by boil sediment sampling in order to estimate water and sediment inflow to and outflow from the system. To determine the effect of sediment transport on the canals’ morphology, five cross-sectional surveys were conducted and changes in bed levels were measured. On the basis of these field data the two computer models, used in this study, were calibrated and validated for flow and sediment transport simulations. The downstream control component of the system is controlled automatically and the PHLC has been equipped with the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system at the headworks. Any discharge withdrawal or refusal by Water Users Associations (WUA) through offtaking secondary canals, or any discharge variation in the inflow from Machai Branch Canal is automatically adjusted by the SCADA system at Gandaf Outlet, the PHLC headworks. The SCADA system has Proportional Integral (PI) discharge controllers. The study found that the existing PI coefficients led to delay in discharge releases and resulted in a long time to achieve flow stability. The discharge releases showed an oscillatory behaviour which affected the functioning of hydro-mechanically operated downstream control “Aval Orifice” (AVIO) and “Aval Surface” (AVIS) gates. After calibration and validation of the model the PI controllers were fine-tuned and proposed for improved canal operation, which would help in system sustainability and in improved operational efficiency of the canals. Field data show that during the study period sedimentation in the studied irrigation canals remained within control limits. The incoming sediment loads were, generally, lower than the sediment transport capacities of the studied irrigation canals. Hence this incoming sediment load was transported by the main canals and distributed to the offtaking canals. The sediment transport capacities of the studied irrigation canals were computed at steady and unsteady state conditions. The canal operation data showed that the system was operated on Supply Based Operation (SBO) approach rather than CBIO. The morphological data revealed that there was no significant deposition in the studied canals. Therefore there was no particular effect on the canal operation and the hydraulic efficiencies, attributed to sediment transport. As mentioned earlier, the Tarbela Reservoir will soon be filled with sediments and consequently PHLC will get sediment laden flows from the reservoir. Various studies have been taken into account to project the time when sediment laden flows will flow into the PHLC and what will be the characteristics and concentrations of the incoming sediments to the PHLC from the reservoir. The studies project that the sediment inflow from the Tarbela Reservoir will be much higher than the sediment transport capacities of the PHLC and Maira Branch Canal under full supply discharge conditions. This scenario will create sediment transport problems in downstream controlled canals, particularly when they will be operated under CBIO. Various management options have been simulated and are presented in order to better manage sediments in the studied canals under the scenario of sediment inflow from Tarbela Reservoir. The hydraulic performance of downstream controlled canals will be affected under this scenario and frequent maintenance and repair will be required to maintain the canals. Various options have been analysed to deal with the problem. The study presents a sediment management plan for downstream controlled irrigation canals by improvements in canal design and operation in combination with the need of settling ponds at the canal headworks. Currently sedimentation in the irrigation canals under study is not a big issue for canal operation and maintenance (O&M). However, it would emerge as a major problem when sediment discharge from the Tarbela Reservoir starts. The canals’ maintenance costs will soar and the hydrodynamic performance of these canals will also be affected. In this study, a number of ways have been evaluated and proposed to deal with the approaching problem of sediment transport in these irrigation canals in order to keep their hydraulic performance at desired levels and to minimize the maintenance costs. The first and the foremost effect of sediment deposition will be reduction in canals’ flow conveyance capacities, which will result in raise of water levels. The raise of water levels will cause a reduction in water supply to the canals due to automatic flow releases. It can be dealt with by a temporary and limited raise in target water levels depending upon the maximum headloss at the downstream AVIS/AVIO <b>cross</b> <b>regulator.</b> Further, to minimize the effect of water level raise on discharge through the AVIS/AVIO gates, the decrement in such canals can be kept relatively small, in order to make the gates less sensitive to water level changes. Further, for efficient withdrawal of sediment to the secondary canals, it is needed to locate the secondary offtakes close to AVIS/AVIO cross regulators on the downstream side. More sediment will be discharged because the turbulent mixing of sediment at the downstream side of the control structures keeps more sediment in suspension. In addition, during the peak sediment concentration periods, the canals need to be operated at supply based operations, in order to minimize the deposition. Sediment transport in general and in irrigation canals in particular, is one of the most studied and discussed topic in the field of fluid mechanics all over the world. It also has been studied extensively in Indus Basin in order to design and manage irrigation canals receiving sediment laden flows. The outcome of Lacey’s regime theory and the subsequent work are the result of these studies. In addition to regime method various other methods like permissible velocity method, tractive force method and the rational methods, etc., have been developed for stable canal design. Anyhow, as a matter of fact, the management of sediment transport in irrigation canals is still a challenging task even after all these investigations and studies. Because most of the knowledge on sediment transport is empirical in nature, most sediment transport formulae have inbuilt randomness, which makes predictions difficult, when conditions are changed. It needs a lot of care while applying a sediment transport formula, developed under one set of conditions, to other situations. Therefore, it becomes extremely important to understand the origin of the development of the formulae and the limitations associated with them before applying some sediment transport formulae to different conditions and circumstances. The introduction of numerical modelling made it comparatively easy to test and shape the sediment transport relationships to some local conditions by running a variety of simulations and calibrating the formula in light of the field measurements. The sediment transport predictions can be made reliable in this way and can be used for further analysis...|$|E

In this article we analyze an original strategy for algal control currently used in a branch of the Canal de Provence (South of France). The management strategy consists of regular flushes causing increases of the bed shear stress from upstream to downstream and consequently algal filament cutting. This is achieved by increasing the discharge at the upstream end of the branch. We first show that turbidity can be used as an indicator for algal detachment. Then, a detachment model is proposed and coupled with the hydrodynamic simulation of the system. It can be fitted very satisfactorily on the turbidity measurements and can be used to improve the management strategy, such as reducing the discharge released...|$|R

Use of control systems is considered {{as one of the}} most assured ways to achieve the aim. In the course of the present study, two centralized controllers are applied to the west canal of Aghili irrigation district in I. R. Iran. The proposed control algorithms consist of a distant Downstream PI Feedback control (DPIF), and a distant Downstream PI Feedback along with Feedforward control (DPIFF). In the controllers, each water-level regulator is adjusted as based on water levels in all the pools of the canal. The test case canal and flow scenarios are simulated using SOBEK. The controllers are evaluated using the simulation results. The results indicated that both of the proposed controllers possess the considerable needed potential to closely match the discharge (at the <b>cross</b> <b>regulators)</b> with those ordered by water users while properly maintaining the water level throughout the length of the canals of the irrigation system. It is apparent that the DPIFF controller is more effective than DPIF controller in providing a desirable performance. Use of these algorithms makes demand oriented water distribution as well as a better performance of the system possible. The DPIFF controller as the main control system accompanied by a local controller as a backup system can be recommended to present an efficient robust control system for the canal...|$|R

In a downstream valve, the moving part of the valve opens {{in the same direction}} as the flow of gas and is kept closed by a spring. The usual form of downstream valve is a spring-loaded poppet with a hard elastomer seat sealing against an adjustable metal [...] "crown" [...] around the inlet orifice. The poppet is lifted away from the crown by a lever operated by the diaphragm. Two patterns are commonly used. One is the classic push-pull arrangement, where the actuating lever goes onto the end of the valve shaft and is held on by a nut. Any deflection of the lever is converted to an axial pull on the valve shaft, lifting the seat off the crown and allowing air to flow. The other is the barrel poppet arrangement, where the poppet is enclosed in a tube which <b>crosses</b> the <b>regulator</b> body and the lever operates through slots in the sides of the tube. The far end of the tube is accessible from the side of the casing and a spring tension adjustment screw may be fitted for limited diver control of the cracking pressure.

40|$|Agricultural {{production}} needs to provide food and fiber for the burgeoning global population {{which is expected}} to touch 9. 25 billion mark by 2050 from the current 7 billion. Agriculture accounts for about 84 % of total water use in Asia, 72 % worldwide, and 87 % in developing countries. The need for improving irrigation management has been figuring high in most of the under developed countries in Asia and Pacific region since beginning of 21 st century. The total actual renewable water resources decreased from 2, 961 m 3 per capita in 2000 to 1, 030 m 3 per capita in 2013 which puts Pakistan in the category of red zone countries. This realization has shifted the attention of the researchers and policy makers to focus on improving the performance of the irrigation systems. To achieve equity in distribution of canal water, new techniques for managing irrigation water resources and for better performance of the irrigation system is required to be given priority under water stress and constraints environment. The simulation models provide information about actual state of the flow anywhere in the canal at any time and are appropriate tools. One dimensional hydrodynamic model, Simulation of Irrigation Canal, SIC is applied for the research study to simulate the hydraulic and operational conditions of Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) for better management and operation. The model was set up using observed cross sectional survey canal data of 2008 - 2010. The observed data of water levels, gate openings and out flows, for August 20 - 27, 2010 was used for calibration of the model. The steady state calibration of the hydraulic model compiles all canal reaches and structures for the actual conditions. The calibration of the model showed close agreement between observed and simulated water levels. As a whole, simulated and actual water levels represented a good calibration of the hydraulic model. The calibration results indicated that the computed water levels were within range of 20 - 35 cm than the observed water levels. After calibration, the model was validated using observed field data of six irrigation periods during 2006 to 2011, (May 10 - 17, 2006; August 24 - 31, 2007 November 8 - 15, 2008; October 07 - 14, 2009; February 20 - 27, 2010 & July 7 - 14, 2011). The results indicated that the computed water levels were within range of 17 - 32 cm than the observed water levels. It showed that the modelcomputed water levels were in close agreement with the observed values for head, middle and tail reaches of the canal. The three statistical approaches i. e., Coefficient of Efficiency -E (Nash-Sutcliff coefficient), coefficient of determination -R 2 and the Studentâ€™s t- test were adopted for evaluation of model performance. The analysis indicated that the model perfromance is resaonably accepatable. Numerical Simulation of Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) canal was performed to compute water levels for 100 % to 40 % of design discharge with and without gate operations. The results showed that without gate operations, at 80 % of design discharge at head, the <b>cross</b> <b>regulators</b> need to be operated to feed 25 % offtakes to their design discharges. Therefore, gate operation is required at 80 % of design discharge. The simulated discharges of offtakes for 100 %, 80 % and 60 % of design discharge at LBDC head indicated that the reduction in the discharges for tail portion offtakes is remarkably more than the offtakes at the head and middle portion when the discharge {{at the head of the}} main canal is reduced from 100 % to 60 %. This indicated that the reduction in discharge from 100 % to 60 % at the head of a main canal, adversely affects the equity conditions along the main canal. The percent reduction varied from 3 - 20 % from head reach to 25 % to 42 % in the tail portion. Based on results of this study, it is recommended to adopt normal range of operation as 80 % for distribution operation instead of 70 %. This study suggests new â€œCombined Efficiency Performance (CEP) â€� parameter as better representative of performance indicator to check the overall hydraulic and operational performance of canal. This indicator helps canal mangers to evaluate the operational plans. When the value of Combined Efficiency Performance (CEP) is between 0. 8 to 1, the canal performance is â€œGoodâ€� and is graded as value equal to 1. When CEP is between 0. 8 to 0. 4, the performance is â€œSatisfactoryâ€�, the canal is graded equal to value 0. 5, while when CEP is less than 0. 4 and greater than 1, the canal performance is â€œPoorâ€� and is graded as value equal to 0. The actual water delivery schedule for period June 15 to July 8, 2011 (Kharif season) was tested and results were compared with optimized plan for performance assessment in terms of equitable distribution of canal water. These indicators are: (a) Delivery Performance Ratio (DPR); (c) Reliability (Pd). (c) Equity (Pe) in water distribution; (d) combined efficiency performance (CEP). The simulations made with ID hydrodynamic SIC Model for LBDC provide information on canal behavior and help canal mangers to optimize operational plan for implementation. Additional modules are developed to better integrate SIC model as Support Tool in the Decision making process of the canal managers. Thus before implementing a new operational procedure in the field, the canal managers can evaluate its likely consequences on the system. The proposed distribution plan with head discharge of 220 m 3 /s of Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) was simulated. The results concluded that the average daily delivery performance ratio (DPR) for actual plan (Kharif 2011) is 0. 94 while for optimized plan; the average DPR value is 0. 97 showing improvement by 4 % on average for optimized plan. The reliability (Pd) of irrigation supply indicated that for actual plan, the Pd value is 0. 048, while for proposed plan, it is 0. 056 indicated improvement by 16. 6 %. The equity (Pe) in terms of water distribution along LBDC main canal concluded that the equity slope for optimized plan is 0. 02 as compared to 0. 077 of actual plan. The Pe for actual plan is 0. 9 while for optimized plan it is 0. 97 indicating 8 % improvement. The evaluation of combined efficiency performance (CEP) of offtakes concluded that for actual plan, the number of offtakes graded as â€œGoodâ€� are 31 while for the proposed plan, the number of offtakes graded as â€œGoodâ€� are 46. The analysis indicated that CEP value for Optimized plan is 0. 82 while for actual plan, CEP value is 0. 77, showing 13 % improvement. In Pakistan, computer oriented research to study hydraulic behavior of large complex network using canal simulation hydraulic models is less common and not constantly implemented. This research study uses hydrodynamic model for simulations of main canal under different operating conditions. The canal managers can optimize the operational plans and implement their decisions in more efficient way than the current practices. The findings of this research serves as a decision support tool for the canal irrigation system managers to formulate effective and responsive control operation strategies under varying flow scenarios...|$|R

Even though {{improvements}} in diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer have been made, it is still {{the most common cause of}} cancer death in women. There is a great need to find biomarkers for early detection of the disease and novel drug targets to fight the cancer. Cell immortalization is the prerequisite step in tumorigenesis, and identification of the biomarkers of immortalized cells may be helpful for early detection of cancer. In this thesis, we described identification of 71 immortalization-related proteins. We used proteomics and conditionally immortalized human breast epithelial cells. Identified proteins showed involvement in immortalization of such functional domains as cell proliferation and growth, death, cell assembly and organization, cellular movement, cell-to-cell signaling, and cell morphology. Kinase MAP 2 K 3 was identified as down-regulated in immortalized cells. Overexpression of MAP 2 K 3 in immortal human breast epithelial cells was sufficient to induce senescence. p 38, p 53 and pRB were modulated by MAP 2 K 3. We also identified KSR 2 as up-regulated in immortalized human breast epithelial cells and in human breast tumors. Twenty-four proteins affected by hyperthermia of human primary breast epithelial cells were also identified. Among the proteins, TGF-β 2 was found up-regulated. It induced HSP 27 expression, and protected cells from cell death. Aberrant protein tyrosine nitration has been associated with different diseases, including cancer. We explored changes in protein tyrosine nitration during the cell cycle, and observed that tyrosine nitration affected a number of cell cycle <b>regulators.</b> <b>Cross</b> talk of different regulatory pathways may contribute to the resistance to the anti-cancer treatment. Targeting of multiple pathways has been regarded as a novel anti-cancer strategy. We showed that combined action of TGF-β 1 and EGF involves changes in phosphorylation of 47 proteins. We observed that the convergence components of TGF-β 1 and EGF, e. g., MEK 1, CK 1, can influence cell proliferation in the context of TGF-β 1 and EGF signaling. Interestingly, we observed that the strongest inhibitory effect of Gefitinib (Iressa), EGFR kinase inhibitor, would be only when both EGF and TGF-β are highly active, and MEK 1 and CK 1 are inhibited. ZAK kinase was identified as a convergent target of TGF-β and EGF signaling, and was found contributing to the positive feedback regulation of cell migration upon combined TGF-β and EGF action. We also studied effects of a long term exposure to EGF and estrogen on tumorigenesis of breast epithelial cells. We observed that the long-term exposure to EGF and 17 β-estradiol may affect proliferation rate, colony formation, vessel formation, and stem cell features of human breast epithelial cells. Thus, our findings provided insights into different mechanisms of tumorigenesis, and impact of cross-talk of signaling pathways on tumor development...|$|R
