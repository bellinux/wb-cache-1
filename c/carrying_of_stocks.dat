40|$|Consumers seek {{products}} of excellence and value propositions that satisfy {{their needs and}} wishes. Companies, while meeting those needs, are facing challenges of how to design, select and manage distribution channels that will ensure maximum savings in distribution costs, enhance product availability and effective co-ordination of channel activities. At the same time, manufacturers are bedevilled with problems of how to provide fast deliveries to customers, maintain optimum inventory volume and ideal market coverage, minimize us of warehouses at the least <b>carrying</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>stock,</b> reduce total distribution costs and maximize customer satisfaction. Consequently, competence is increasing exponentially and things are getting more difficult for companies to reach de market. Thus, this study {{is focused on the}} task <b>of</b> <b>carrying</b> out a research about alternative marketing channels that complement the conventional ones in order to increase the market share and finally satisfy the current needs of the customers. All through the study, some topics can be highlighted: the theoretical research of the main concepts related with the marketing channels, a deeper inquiry in the alternative marketing channels and the door-to-door channel (theory, origins and current examples) and finally the study of a practical case including information about the company, the situation’s context or the social and business impact. Furthermore, along the evolution of the research, some interesting topics have been discovered and included in the thesis such as women’s empowerment in the direct selling channels and the fusion of the Corporate Social Responsibility and the Business’ Strategy...|$|R
40|$|Manufacturers facing {{uncertain}} demand {{may induce}} distributors to <b>carry</b> ample <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> their products {{by agreeing to}} accept returns of unsold goods for credit. The authors model the manufacturer's decision to accept returns, showing that this decision depends crucially {{on the nature of}} the demand uncertainty. Uncertainty over customer arrivals favors returns, while uncertainty over consumers' valuation of the manufacturer's product leads distributors to set retail prices too high (from the manufacturer's standpoint) when returns are allowed. The authors show that returns can be expected to raise retail prices, while maintaining shrinking distributor margins.

50|$|Optimal {{stocking}} density is often {{defined by the}} <b>carrying</b> capacity <b>of</b> the <b>stocked</b> environment {{and the amount of}} individual space needed by the fish, which is very species specific. Although behavioural interactions such as shoaling may mean that high stocking densities are beneficial to some species, in many cultured species high stocking densities may be of concern. Crowding can constrain normal swimming behaviour, as well as increase aggressive and competitive behaviours such as cannibalism, feed competition, territoriality and dominance/subordination hierarchies. This potentially increases the risk of tissue damage due to abrasion from fish-to-fish contact or fish-to-cage contact. Fish can suffer reductions in food intake and food conversion efficiency. In addition, high stocking densities can result in water flow being insufficient, creating inadequate oxygen supply and waste product removal. Dissolved oxygen is essential for fish respiration and concentrations below critical levels can induce stress and even lead to asphyxiation. Ammonia, a nitrogen excretion product, is highly toxic to fish at accumulated levels, particularly when oxygen concentrations are low.|$|R

When on-site maintenance is required, as in several cases ranging from washing machines to large-sized machineries, field service engineers <b>carry</b> a <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> service parts in their vehicles to carry out repair interventions. The Repair Kit Problem (RKP) aims at determining the <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> service parts to be carried on the vehicles in order to optimize costs and/or customer service level. A literature review highlights that the models developed so far tend to neglect features that are important for practitioners.
