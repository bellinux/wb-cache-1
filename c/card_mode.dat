5000|$|Debit {{cards are}} quite popular in Italy. There are both classic and prepaid cards. The main classic debit card in Italy is Bancomat/PagoBancomat: {{this kind of}} card is issued by Italian banks. Bancomat is the {{commercial}} brand for the cash withdrawal circuit, while PagoBancomat is used for POS transactions. Unlike other European countries such as UK, only a few Italian banks are issuing Visa/MasterCard debit cards (such as Intesa Sanpaolo NextCard). The main international debit circuit used by Italian banks is Maestro: for this reason almost every debit card issued in Italy has both PagoBancomat and Maestro logos, with Bancomat/PagoBancomat being used in Italy and the Maestro circuit when abroad. Sometimes, instead of using the Maestro circuit, the Bancomat/PagoBancomat debit card is issued along with V-Pay or Visa Electron logos, or sometimes with credit card functions (so you get a dual-mode card). In this last case, only the credit-card mode is allowed for abroad/Internet transactions, while the debit <b>card</b> <b>mode</b> is used only in Italy. The most popular prepaid debit card is [...] "Postepay". It is issued by Poste italiane S.p.A., and runs on the Visa Electron circuit. It {{can be used on}} Poste Italiane's ATMs (Postamat) and on Visa's Electron-compatible bank ATMs all over the world. It has no fees when used on the Internet and in POS-based transactions. Other cards are issued by other companies, such as Vodafone CashCard, Banca Popolare di Milano's Carta Jeans and Carta Moneta Online.|$|E

30|$|We {{advanced}} to micro-cycle 1.2 by inviting {{two groups of}} students to try out the revamped system. The first group was comprised of 15 out of the 37 students {{who were involved in}} the experiment in micro-cycle 1.1 (who had moved up to primary 5). The second group was comprised of 16 primary 3 students, also with mixed abilities in Chinese. We repeated the same trial design as the first micro-cycle, except that the researchers no longer facilitated the game sessions. Instead the researchers assisted the Chinese teacher of the future experimental class in our next cycle of study to facilitate the game-related activities. After the experiments, most of the students indicated that they preferred the phone mode. The primary 5 group who used to prefer the <b>card</b> <b>mode</b> in the last micro-cycle told us that the new UI had essentially resolved the “problem” of an inconvenient character composition process, with the additional advantage of letting them see all their peers’ components on one screen—an affordance that the <b>card</b> <b>mode</b> cannot offer.|$|E

30|$|We {{reflected}} on the game processes to consider whether we should give up the phone mode and proceed to use the cards for our future study. We let the domain-specific (language acquisition) and cognitive theories inform and guide us in deciding whether we should accommodate or rectify the students’ use of their emergent game strategy. A detailed account of our reflection and improvement process is reported in Wong et al. (2011 a). Our decision was to retain and improve the mCSCL solution. Guided by the framework, we revised the learning and technological designs. For example, the students’ trial-and-error strategy in the <b>card</b> <b>mode</b> inspired us to re-design the smartphone UI to show “virtual cards” of individual components that can be dragged and dropped onto the working space to try assembling (emergent peer scaffolding → technological scaffolding; left arrow A in Fig.  2). The tedious manual scoring tasks have been automated as well; individual students’ scorings and their overall rankings are dynamically updated in the teacher’s console (proposed teacher scaffolding → technological scaffolding; right arrow A in Fig.  2).|$|E
