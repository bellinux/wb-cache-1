5|$|Section 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 {{authorized}} writs {{of error}} from the circuit courts only in <b>civil</b> <b>cases.</b> The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801which created the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia and granted it jurisdiction over crimes committed within the federal districtdid not explicitly limit writs of error from the D.C. circuit court to <b>civil</b> <b>cases,</b> except {{insofar as it}} required an amount in controversy. Although the Court reached the merits of a criminal writ of error from the D.C. circuit court in United States v. Simms (1803), without any discussion of the jurisdictional issue, in United States v. More (1805), the Court held {{that it had no}} such jurisdiction. More held that Congress's piecemeal statutory grants of appellate jurisdiction to the Court operated as an exercise of Congress's power under the Exceptions Clause, eliminating all jurisdiction not explicitly granted.|$|E

The Seventh {{is one of the few}} parts of the Bill of Rights not to be incorporated (applied to the states).|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{the appellate}} {{provision}} of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the appellate {{provision of the}} act of February 27, 1801 was not explicitly limited to <b>civil</b> <b>cases</b> (except insofar as it incorporated the former by reference). Further, because the D.C. circuit court was not constituted {{within the framework of}} the Judiciary Act of 1802, appeals to the Supreme Court by way of certificates of division could not issue. After More, the Marshall Court heard six appeals from the D.C. circuit court via original habeas.|$|E

Except for some municipal benches, partisan elections select judges at all levels of the judiciary; the governor fills vacancies by appointment. Texas is notable for its use of capital punishment, having led the country in executions since capital punishment was reinstated in the Gregg v. Georgia case (see Capital punishment in Texas).|$|E
5|$|The western {{county of}} Augusta in Virginia {{could no longer}} {{serve the needs of}} the far flung pioneers along the New River, and so in 1769, the county of Botetourt was created. Trigg was one of several {{appointed}} as its first justices of the peace, which was a judge presiding over misdemeanors and other <b>civil</b> <b>cases.</b> From 1770 to 1771, he served as magistrate, Justice of the County Court in Chancery and a Justice of Oyer and Terminer, which was a criminal court. When the town of Fincastle, Virginia was forming in 1770, Trigg was instrumental in its development, helping to sell lots and build the town's prison along with a courthouse with his father-in-law, Israel Christian.|$|E
