40|$|This {{fact sheet}} is an {{overview}} of the U. S. Department of Energy's Advanced <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Office.</b> <b>Manufacturing</b> is <b>central</b> to our economy, culture, and history. The industrial sector produces 11 % of U. S. gross domestic product (GDP), employs 12 million people, and generates 57 % of U. S. export value. However, U. S. industry consumes about one-third of all energy produced in the United States, and significant cost-effective energy efficiency and advanced manufacturing opportunities remain unexploited. As a critical component of the National Innovation Policy for Advanced Manufacturing, the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Advanced <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Office</b> (AMO) is focused on creating a fertile environment for advanced manufacturing innovation, enabling vigorous domestic development of transformative manufacturing technologies, promoting coordinated public and private investment in precompetitive advanced manufacturing technology infrastructure, and facilitating the rapid scale-up and market penetration of advanced manufacturing technologies...|$|R
