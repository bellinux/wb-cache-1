If the bubble reaches a <b>critical</b> <b>volume,</b> it will have a mechanical effect on the nerve endings causing pain in a tendon. The bubble volume is the critical parameter.

500|$|Most {{observed}} displays by grey reef sharks {{have been}} {{in response to a}} diver (or submersible) approaching and following it from a few meters behind and above. They also perform the display towards moray eels, and in one instance towards a much larger great hammerhead (which subsequently withdrew). However, they have never been seen performing threat displays towards each other. This suggests the display is primarily a response to potential threats (i.e. predators) rather than competitors. As grey reef sharks are not territorial, they are speculated to be defending a <b>critical</b> <b>volume</b> of [...] "personal space" [...] around themselves. Compared to sharks from French Polynesia or Micronesia, grey reef sharks from the Indian Ocean and western Pacific are not as aggressive and less given to displaying.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{majority}} of defects found in manufacturing lines have predominantly 2 -Dimensional effects, there are many situations in which 2 D defect models do not suffice, e. g. tall layer bulks disrupting the continuity of subsequent layers, abrupt surface topologies, extraneous materials embedded in the IC, etc. In this paper, a procedure to capture the catastrophic effect of 3 -Dimensional defects is presented. This approach {{is based on the}} geometrical properties that result from the interaction between IC and defect size in two coordinate spaces: x-y and z. The approach is a natural extension to the concept of critical areas, namely, the extraction of <b>critical</b> <b>volumes.</b> Through the course of this work hints to the origins of 3 D defects will be given, conditions to capture <b>critical</b> <b>volumes</b> will be developed, and it will be shown that the net effect of 3 D defects is accumulated from layer to laye...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of an equilibrium system of two drops suspended from circular holes is examined. The drop surfaces are disconnected surfaces of a connected liquid body. For holes of equal radii and identical pendant drops axisymmetric perturbations {{are always the}} most dangerous. The stability region for two identical drops differs considerably from that for a single drop. Loss of stability leads to a transition from a critical system of identical drops to a stable system of axisymmetric non-identical. This system of non-identical drops reaches its own stability limit (to isochoric or non-isochoric paturbations). For non-identical drops, loss of stability results in dripping or streaming from the holes. <b>Critical</b> <b>volumes</b> for non-identical drops have been calculated as functions of the Bond number, B. For unequal hole radii, stability regions have been constructed {{for a set of}} hole radius, K. The dependence of <b>critical</b> <b>volumes</b> on K and B is analyzed...|$|R

2500|$|Stratovolcanoes are {{a common}} feature of {{subduction}} zones. The magma that forms them arises when water, which is trapped both in hydrated minerals and in the porous basalt rock of the upper oceanic crust, is released into mantle rock of the asthenosphere above the sinking oceanic slab. The release of water from hydrated minerals is termed [...] "dewatering", and occurs at specific pressure/temperature conditions for specific minerals as the plate subducts to lower depths. The water freed from the subducting slab lowers the melting point of the overlying mantle rock, which then undergoes partial melting and rises due to its density relative to the surrounding mantle rock, and pools temporarily {{at the base of}} the lithosphere. The magma then rises through the crust, incorporating silica rich crustal rock, leading to a final intermediate composition. When the magma nears the surface it pools in a magma chamber under the volcano. The relatively low pressure of the magma allows water and other volatiles (CO2, S2−, Cl−) dissolved in the magma to begin to come out of solution, much like when a bottle of carbonated water is opened. Once a <b>critical</b> <b>volume</b> of magma and gas accumulates, the obstacle provided by the volcanic cone is overcome, leading to a sudden explosive eruption.|$|E
