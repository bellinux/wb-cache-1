40|$|Abstract During {{treatment}} of winery and distillery wastewater by natural evaporation in ponds, formation of malodorous compounds induces harmful olfactory effects. In this work, we studied {{the origin of}} malodorous compounds and methods to prevent and treat odours. The formation of volatile fatty acids (VFA) from pure substrates (glycerol, lactic and tartaric acids, ethanol) and complex media (winery and distillery wastewater) was studied. Various anaerobic bacteria ferment the glycerol and produce butyric or propionic <b>acid.</b> Valeric and <b>caproic</b> <b>acids</b> were observed at lower concentrations than butyric and propionic acids, but their malodorous intensities were higher. Microflora produce butyric, valeric, caproic, heptanoic and octanoic acids from ethanol, {{the main component of}} winery wastewater. When nitrate (an electron acceptor) is added, catabolism leads to an anaerobic respiration phenomenon (denitrification). The organic compounds are oxidised to CO 2 and the nitrate is reduced to N 2 (odourless compounds), without VFA formation. The preventive {{treatment of}} odours by nitrate addition was tested on an industrial scale in winery and distillery ponds.

40|$|A gas chromatographic method with a {{capillary}} column and a programmed temperature vaporizer injector {{has been used}} to analyze the individual free fatty acids in cheese. The lipids were extracted from an acidified cheese slurry with diethyl ether and treated with tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) to convert the free fatty acids to tetramethylammonium soaps (TMA-soaps), which were subsequently pyrolyzed to methyl esters in the injector. Carrying out injection at the initial column temperature resulted in lower dispersion of the results, but the solvent front prevented quantitative determination of butyric and <b>caproic</b> <b>acids,</b> and an injector temperature of 300 °C was therefore employed. Under the conditions tested, trimethylamine (tma) flash-off did not affect the determinations. The accuracy of the method improved at higher free fatty acid contents (coefficient of variation of 0. 53 % for a total free fatty acid content of 9000 mg/kg as opposed to 7. 0 % for a total free fatty acid. content of 1400 mg/kg).

Certain wild strains of L. lactis isolated from vegetables or raw milk products are able to generate flavors different from those produced by industrial strains. The aim of this work was to assess the production of volatile compounds in miniature Chihuahua-type cheeses manufactured with different strains of L. lactis isolated from vegetables, raw milk products, and industrial cultures. There was variation among volatile profiles in the miniature cheeses manufactured with different strains of L. lactis. However, some compounds were seen in most of the cheeses such as acetic, lactic, butyric, and <b>caproic</b> <b>acids,</b> acetoin, 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol, and 2, 3 -butanediol. The source of isolation of the strains (plants, raw milk products, and industrial cultures) did not have a clear influence on the production of volatile compounds in miniature cheeses. According to principal component analysis, 19 out of 21 strains of L. lactis produced volatile profiles similar to the three pasteurized Chihuahua cheeses analyzed, but only 2 strains generated profiles similar to the commercial raw milk cheese.

40|$|Fungal {{growth in}} bakery {{products}} represents {{the most frequent}} cause of spoilage and leads to economic losses for industrials and consumers. Bacteria, such as lactic acid bacteria and propionibacteria, are commonly known to {{play an active role}} in preservation of fermented food, producing a large range of antifungal metabolites. In a previous study (Le Lay et al., 2016), an extensive screening performed both in vitro and in situ allowed for the selection of bacteria exhibiting an antifungal activity. In the present study, active supernatants against Penicillium corylophilum and Aspergillus niger were analyzed to identify and quantify the antifungal compounds associated with the observed activity. Supernatant treatments (pH neutralization, heating and addition of proteinase K) suggested that organic acids played the most important role in the antifungal activity of each tested supernatant. Different methods (HPLC, mass spectrometry, colorimetric and enzymatic assays) were then applied to analyze the supernatants and it was shown that the main antifungal compounds corresponded to lactic, acetic and propionic acids, ethanol and hydrogen peroxide, as well as other compounds present at low levels such as phenyllactic, hydroxyphenyllactic, azelaic and <b>caproic</b> <b>acids.</b> Based on these results, various combinations of the identified compounds were used to evaluate their effect on conidial germination and fungal growth of P. corylophilum and Eurotium repens.

Samples of rumen headspace gas and corresponding samples of rumen liquor were taken from three lactating cows, prepared with rumen fistulae, at intervals after receiving their morning feed allocation (grass silage and concentrates).

The concentrations of these sulfur compounds declined over the interval after feeding, mirroring ammonia concentrations measured in rumen liquor, reflecting their common dependence on the fermentation of sulfur amino acids. Ammonia concentrations in rumen headspace gas varied in the opposite direction to the concentration of ammonia in rumen liquor and likely depend more on the pH of rumen liquor. Consideration of the pKa of ammonia suggests that ammonia concentrations in rumen gas will be very low below pH 6, representing a useful diagnostic for subacute ruminal acidosis.

Butyric acid levels first increased and then decreased in the co-culture fermentation system, which differed from what was observed in the mono-culture fermentation in which butyric acid levels increased over the first 8  days and then stabilized, although maximal butyric acid levels were lower at all times in this system. <b>Caproic</b> <b>acid</b> began to accumulate only after 3  days in both the mono- and co-culture fermentation systems. Typically <b>caproic</b> <b>acid</b> is produced secondary {{to the formation of}} butyric acid, as butyric acid is a precursor for <b>caproic</b> <b>acid</b> production. In present study, C. kluyveri H 588 mono-culture led to a maximum <b>caproic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration of 253.69  mg/ 100  mL, with the entire fermentation process being completed in 10  days. In contrast, the co-culture fermentation process required only 9  days and yielded greater <b>caproic</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations of 410.21  mg/ 100  mL. Compared with the mono-culture fermentation system, the accumulation of <b>caproic</b> <b>acid</b> in the mixed culture fermentation containing both C. kluyveri H 588 and Methanogen 166 was therefore increased by 61.7 %.

30|$|By {{comparing}} {{the levels of}} <b>caproic</b> <b>acid,</b> butyric acid, H 2, and CH 4 present during single and the mixed culture fermentations, we can conclude that BES caused a strong inhibition of methane production and induced the accumulation of H 2 and butyric acid (Figs.  3, 4). Figure  4 also shows that the production of <b>caproic</b> <b>acid</b> is significantly negatively correlated with the H 2 production. Wu (2000) demonstrated that high levels of H 2 produced from <b>caproic</b> <b>acid</b> fermentation by C. Kluyveri can act in a feedback loop to inhibit the growth and metabolism of C. Kluyveri, decreasing subsequent <b>caproic</b> <b>acid</b> production. However, when C. kluyveri was co-cultured with a Methanogen, this <b>caproic</b> <b>acid</b> fermentation could be regulated via “interspecies hydrogen transfer”, wherein the Methanogen converts the accumulated hydrogen into methane, thereby eliminating the product inhibition of hydrogen on C. kluyveri.

The {{first part of the}} work deals with lipids classification, summary of fatty acids and their properties. It contains also a draft of edible fats division and their production. Other section deals with ways of determination of fatty acids in fats and puts the main emphasis on gas chromatography. The second part deals with the determination of fatty acids in selected shortening fats (Hera, Stela, Zlatá Haná, Sluna, Perla máslová, Flora, Rama máslová, Alfa máslová) in practice. Three measurements were taken at three months intervals. There were taken three samples from each fat during each sampling, it means 72 samples were taken in total. Samples had to be adjusted to increase their volatility. In this case specifically the esterification was made where fatty acids were transformed into fatty acids methyl esters. The measurement was made by the flame chromatograph using the flame ionization detector and the mass spectometer. For final samples evaluation softwares MS Worsktations 6. 9, Microsoft Excel ? Statistical programs and software Statistica by Stat Soft ČR, s. r. o. were used. The prevailing fatty acid in all fats is oleic acid. Another acid widely presented in all fats is palmitoleic acid. The only exception is fat Flora where linoleic acid has the biggest percentage. Fatty acids typical for milk fat (butyric and <b>caproic</b> <b>acids,</b> TFA and acids with odd number of carbon atoms (C 15 a C 17)) are chiefly presented in fat Zlatá Haná. In other fats these fatty acids are found just in small quantities. By comparing single samplings it becomes clear that they are more or less different. The reason of these differences lies probably in fats mixing. That is why during production some small differences in their composition may occur. The principal komponent analysis shows that Zlatá Haná is the most different fat. The reason is that this fat contains the most fatty acids typical for milk fat. Another separate group is represented by fat Flora where the biggest quantity of polyunsaturated fatty acids (linoleic acid) can be found.

V The mono 2 : 1 l dinitrophenyl hydrazone appears to be cyclic. Reduction both with lithium aluminium hydride and sodium borohydride yields 2, 6 diol 3, 4, 5 hexafluoro n-heptane. VI There is {{evidence to suggest that}} reaction with dried calcium sulphate gives 2 ene, 2 methyl 3, 4, 5 hexafluor 6 one cyclo-hexaneVII Reaction with benzoyl chloride affords 2, 6 dibenzoate, 2, 6 dimethyl hexafluoro pyran. VIII 4 one 1, 2, 3, hexafluorocaproic acid was characterised as a 2 : 4 dinitro phenyl hydrazoneIX and also as an S benzyl thio-uranium salt. X Infra-red spectral evidence suggests the S benzyl thio uranium salt probably exists in the straight chain form. Numbers in the above text refer to the Flow Sheet, Figure 1...|$|R
