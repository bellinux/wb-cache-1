Black-eyed pea, a common name used for the unguiculata cultivar group, describes {{the presence of a}} distinctive black spot at the hilum of the seed. Black-eyed peas were first introduced to the southern states in the United States and some early varieties had peas squashed closely together in their pods, leading to the other common names of southern pea and <b>crowder-pea.</b> Sesquipedalis in Latin means [...] "foot and a half long", and this subspecies which arrived in the United States via Asia is characterised by unusually long pods, leading to the common names of yardlong bean, asparagus bean and Chinese long-bean.|$|E
