40|$|Rheology of <b>cohesive</b> {{granular}} <b>matter</b> {{under the}} constant pressure condition is studied {{by means of}} molecular dynamics simulation. Depending on the shear rate, the pressure, and the cohesiveness, the system exhibits four distinctive phases: uniform shear, oscillation, shear-banding, and clustering. The friction coefficient is found to increase with the inertial number irrespective of the cohesiveness. We find an abnormally large friction coefficient for strong cohesion and low pressure. This trend is explained by the anisotropies of the coordination number and the angular distribution of the inter-particle forces. Particularly, we show that the second nearest neighbors {{play a crucial role}} in the rheology for cohesive systems. Comment: 10 pages, 14 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the spatial structure of <b>cohesive</b> granular <b>matter</b> with spheres floating at an air-liquid interface that form disordered close packings with pores in between. The interface is slowly lowered in a conical container to uniformly compress {{and study the}} system as a function of area fraction ϕ. We find that the free area distributions associated with Voronoi cells show significant exponential tails indicating greater heterogeneity compared with random distributions at low ϕ with a crossover towards a Γ-distribution as ϕ is increased. Further, we find significant short range order as measured by the radial correlation function and the orientational order parameter even at low and intermediate ϕ, which is absent when particles interact only sterically.

40|$|International audienceWe {{report an}} {{experimental}} study of the morphology of fractures in cohesive granular materials. Cohesion is introduced by equilibrating the grains with a humid atmosphere. The setup allows to produce a controlled crack in {{a thin layer of}} a glass beads assembly, and observe with an extremely high resolution the edge of the fracture at the free surface of the layer. The detailed multi-scale analysis of the fracture profile reveals the presence, in the bulk of the material, of clusters of grains whose size increases monotonically with the relative humidity. These results are important because the formation of clusters, resulting in a heterogeneity of the cohesion force, governs the mechanical properties of <b>cohesive</b> granular <b>matter</b> in contact with a humid atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|Discrete element {{modelling}} (DEM) {{is one of}} {{the most}} efficient computational approaches to the fracture processes of heterogeneous materials on mesoscopic scales. From the dynamics of single crack propagation through the statistics of crack ensembles to the rapid fragmentation of materials DEM had a substantial contribution to our understanding over the past decades. Recently, the combination of DEM with other simulation techniques like Finite Element Modelling further extended the field of applicability. In this paper we briefly review the motivations and basic idea behind the DEM approach to <b>cohesive</b> particulate <b>matter</b> and then we give an overview of on-going developments and applications of the method focusing on two fields where recent success has been achieved. We discuss current challenges of this rapidly evolving field and outline possible future perspectives and debates...|$|R

The data were obtained using two, near-bed instrument packages. Correlations of daily-averaged SPM concentrations and fluxes with both runoff and tidal range during the separate deployments often showed a significant dependence on these variables. Where statistically significant, increasing tidal range led to enhanced SPM levels because of resuspension of bed sediments...|$|R

The work’s <b>cohesive</b> subject <b>matter</b> is the author’s European vacation directly following her divorce. Within the pieces, the author attempts to reconcile who she is when starting over and she begins to ask questions regarding the human condition: How do I learn to exhibit intimacy again, not just with romantic partners, but with also in a familial way with my father, and how does absence in these relationships affect my journey and how I write about it? How do I view, and remake myself, when finding my identity that was tied to another individual compromised? How does a body, both physical and belonging to me, and physical as text, take certain shapes to reflect my understanding? How do I define truth, and how do I interpret truth and authenticity in both experience and writing? How do I define and {{know the difference between}} belief and truth? And finally, how does narrative and language protect, or expose me? The Inevitable: Withdrawn considers debates regarding the definition of narrative in order to address a spectrum of non-fiction writing.

40|$|Experiments on a {{thin layer}} of <b>cohesive</b> wet {{granular}} <b>matter</b> under vertical vibrations reveal kink separated domains that collide with the container at different phases. Due to the strong cohesion arising from the formation of liquid bridges between adjacent particles, the domains move collectively upon vibrations. Depending on the periodicity of this collective motion, the kink fronts may propagate, couple with each other and form rotating spiral patterns in the case of period tripling, or stay as standing wave patterns in the case of period doubling. Moreover, both patterns may coexist with granular `gas bubbles' - phase separation into a liquidlike and a gaslike state. Stability diagrams for the instabilities measured with various granular layer mass $m$ and container height $H$ are presented. The onsets for both types of patterns and their dependency on $m$ and $H$ can be quantitatively captured with a model considering the granular layer as a single particle colliding completely inelastically with the container.

40|$|The {{cohesive}} {{energy of}} condensed matter in strong magnetic fields {{is a fundamental}} quantity characterizing magnetized neutron star surfaces. The cohesive energy refers to the energy required to pull an atom out of the bulk condensed matter at zero pressure. Theoretical models of pulsar and magnetar magnetospheres depend on the cohesive properties of the surface matter in strong magnetic fields. For example, depending on the cohesive energy of the surface matter, an acceleration zone ("polar gap") above the polar cap of a pulsar {{may or may not}} form. Also, condensation of the neutron star surface, if it occurs, can significantly affect thermal emission from isolated neutron stars. We describe our calculations of the <b>cohesive</b> property of <b>matter</b> in strong magnetic fields, and discuss the implications of our results to the recent observations of neutron star surface emission {{as well as to the}} detection/non-detection of radio emission from magnetars.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to advance the fundamental understanding of mixingand segregation of cohesive granular materials. Cohesion can arise from a variety ofsources: van der Waals forces, electrostatic forces, liquid bridging (capillary) forces. These forces may {{play a significant role}} in the processing of fine and/or moist powdersin many industries, from pharmaceuticals to materials synthesis; however, despite itsprevalence, there is only limited information available in the literature on processingof cohesive materials. Instead, the vast majority of work has been directed at thestudy of non-cohesive (i. e., free-flowing) particles, and a wealth of information hasbeen learned about the behavior of cohesionless materials. With growing emphasis oncontrolling the structure of materials at increasingly small length-scales (even tending toward the nano-scale), understanding the effects of particle interactions - which tendto dominate at smaller length-scales - on processing operations has become moreimportant than ever. This project focuses on the effects of cohesion on mixing and segregation in simple,industrially-relevant, granular flows. In particular, the paradigm cases of a slowlyrotated tumbler and the flow in a simple shear cell are examined. We take a novel approach to this problem, placing emphasis on microscopic (particle-level), discrete modeling so as to take as its staring point the well understood interaction laws governing cohesion (capillary, van der Waals, etc.), and build to the view of the macroscopic flow via experiment and Particle Dynamics Simulation. We develop and use discretecharacterization tools of cohesive behavior in order to construct a simple theoryregarding the mixing and segregation tendency of <b>cohesive</b> granular <b>matter.</b> This theory allows us to analytically determine a phase diagram, showing both mixed and segregated phases, and agrees both quantitatively and qualitatively with experiment. These results have implications for industrial mixing/separation processes as well as novel particle production methods (e. g., engineered agglomerates with preciselyprescribed compositions) ...|$|R
60|$|The {{two girls}} wept in common, {{for a long}} time after Marguerite had disappeared. This intercourse, chastened as it was by sorrow, and {{rendered}} endearing on the one side by a confiding ingenuousness, and on the other by generous pity, caused both to live in that short period, as it were, months together in a near and dear intimacy. Confidence is not always the growth of time. There are minds that meet each other with a species of affinity that resembles the <b>cohesive</b> property of <b>matter,</b> and with a promptitude and faith that only belongs to the purer essence of which they are composed. But when this attraction of the ethereal part of the being is aided by the feelings that have been warmed by an interest so tender as that which the hearts of both the maidens felt in a common object, its power is not only stronger, but quicker, in making itself felt. So much was already known by each of the other's character, fortunes, and hopes (always with the exception of Adelheid's most sacred secret, which Sigismund cherished as a deposit by far too sacred to be shared even with his sister) that the meeting under no circumstances could have been that of strangers, and their mutual knowledge came as an assistant to break down the barriers of those forms which were so irksome to their longings for a freer interchange of feeling and thought. Adelheid possessed too much intellectual tact to have recourse to the every-day language of consolation. When she did speak, which, as became her superior rank and less embarrassed situation, she was the first to do, it in general but friendly allusions.|$|R

Matter, energy and information are neutral because they are related to inexorable legitimate. They are neutral because they are perfectly bound to one another. Regularity and uniformity are the primary forms of neutrality. The study further radiographies the relational connections, and it highlights and renders visible the attributes and characteristics of the elements (attributes are essential features of elements and characteristics are their specific features). It explains the bilateral relationships matter-energy, information-matter and energy-information. Extension method of Cai Wen (1999) is utilized to clarify relationships between Matter, Energy and Information. It finally results that reality is an ongoing and complex process of bilateral and multi-lateral convertibility. Thus, it is formulated the neutrosophic principle of Interconvertibility Matter-Energy-Information (NPI_MEI) ...|$|R
