To put it simply, if someone undertakes an activity with the promise of a delayed reward after, the task's completion becomes more likely.|$|E

The nymphs can also serve as intermediate hosts for the horsehair worm Paragordius varius, which causes its definitive host, a grasshopper, to jump into water and drown.|$|E
