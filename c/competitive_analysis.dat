Early versions had just 40 virus definitions and were mostly distributed to friends and family members.

This led to more business for Kaspersky from European and American companies. Kaspersky Lab was founded three years later by Kaspersky, his wife and Kaspersky's friend. Natalya, who pushed Eugene to start the company, was the CEO, while Eugene {{was the head of}} research. The following year, the CIH virus (AKA the Chernobyl virus) created a boon for Kaspersky's anti-virus products, which Kaspersky said was the only software at the time that could cleanse the virus. According to Wired, [...] "their software was advanced for the time." [...] For example, it was the first software to monitor viruses in an isolated quarantine.|$|E

A business system consists of the various elements of the system of activities that a company employs to make and deliver products or services to a target market. At each stage of the system, the company has a range of choices for performing the activities and balancing the overall system to deliver the product or service most cost-effectively. <b>Competitive</b> cost <b>analysis</b> allows a company to benchmark its activities against selected competitors in a target market.|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{presented}} work Competitive Intelligence: A <b>competitive</b> environment <b>analysis</b> of PolyPLASTY s. r. o. Company is {{to outline}} theoretical principals that are used for competitive environment analyses, to analyze the competitive environment of a company named PolyPLASTY s. r. o. and to design ontology for <b>analysis</b> of corporate <b>competitive</b> environment by using Topic Maps technology. A common contribution I would like to achieve by writing this paper is firstly to produce the <b>competitive</b> environment <b>analysis</b> for PolyPLASTY s. r. o. and to outline theoretical principles possible. Besides that, an annotated document and knowledge base essentials have been created. The knowledge base might me used for building a knowledge portal to monitor the competitive environment of PolyPLASTY Company systematically. This paper has been produced thanks to information gathered on an interview with Ing. Vlček and many other information resources. Seminar papers written by students of the University of Economics in Prague concerning <b>competitive</b> intelligence <b>analysis</b> for companies from Omni pack Cluster based on Porter's Five Forces method has been used a lot. The analysis has been produced as a structured document annotated by Topic Maps technology (in the structure used at the University of Economics) as well. The document also represents a knowledge base {{which can be used}} to build a knowledge portal for systematic monitoring of competitive environment of PolyPLASTY Company. The paper consists of two parts. The first one begins with Competitive Intelligence introduction. A plenty of theoretical principles {{that can be used for}} <b>competitive</b> intelligence <b>analysis</b> follow. Methods "Porter's five Forces Analysis" and STEEP (Social, Technological, Economic, Ecological and Political aspects) have been brought closer. At the end of the theoretical part the concept of Topic Maps have been described. The second part is concerned with application of mentioned methods in conditions of PolyPLASTY Company from Omni pack Cluster. The application part continues with a manager output describing acquired analysis results shortly. A description of created knowledge base concludes the second part. The annotated document as well as the knowledge base can be found on enclosed CD...|$|R

Since <b>competitive</b> intelligence <b>analysis</b> exercises are designed to improve decision-making by institutionalizing the learning function of debate, their dynamics stand to be elucidated through critique informed by argumentation theory.

40|$|Three {{methods to}} {{quantify}} gene transcript levels in mast cells, real-time RT-PCR, competitive RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR analyses, were compared. Linear regression analysis on five gene transcripts {{revealed that the}} mRNA levels measured by real-time RT-PCR analysis were minimally correlated with those by conventional RT-PCR analysis. In addition, differences in the mRNA level between samples measured by conventional RT-PCR analysis were smaller than those by real-time RT-PCR analysis, suggesting that conventional RT-PCR analysis is less sensitive at measuring mRNA levels. Results from <b>competitive</b> RT-PCR <b>analysis</b> correlated closely with those from real-time RT-PCR analysis. When the differences in mRNA level between samples are relatively smaller, however, the correlation tended to be weaker. Real-time RT-PCR analysis has higher reliability, but is expensive. In contrast, <b>competitive</b> RT-PCR <b>analysis</b> is inexpensive, but is weaker at detecting smaller differences in gene transcript level between samples. Therefore, the most appropriate analytical method to measure mRNA levels should be chosen, depending on the experimental conditions...|$|R
