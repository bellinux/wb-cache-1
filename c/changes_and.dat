40|$|This paper contextualises the {{relation}} between climate <b>change</b> <b>and</b> human migration using the concepts of neoliberalism, sovereignty and otherness. The paper is intended to provide a general account of climate <b>change</b> <b>and</b> migration research, which seeks to extend understanding of {{the relation}} beyond a focus on policy and policy-relevant research. The argument is that because {{the relation between}} climate <b>change</b> <b>and</b> migration is so vast, touching on so many aspects of life, the debate on climate <b>change</b> <b>and</b> migration needs to be pluralised. This is especially the case given the future-conditional nature {{of the relation between}} climate <b>change</b> <b>and</b> migration...|$|R

This universal common ancestor of all organisms {{is believed to have}} appeared about 3.5 billion years ago. Biologists regard the ubiquity of the genetic code as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (see: origin of life).|$|E

5|$|Altitudinal {{migration}} {{is a form}} of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions. It is most often triggered by temperature <b>changes</b> <b>and</b> usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food. Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability. Parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.|$|E
5|$|Annual {{variations}} in climatic temperatures can affect sex ratios, since loggerheads have temperature-dependent sex determination. High sand temperatures may skew gender ratios {{in favor of}} females. Nesting sites exposed to unseasonably warm temperatures {{over a three-year period}} produced 87–99% females. This raises concern over the connection between rapid global temperature <b>changes</b> <b>and</b> the possibility of population extinction. A more localized effect on gender skewing comes from the construction of tall buildings, which reduce sun exposure, lowering the average sand temperature, which results in a shift in gender ratios to favor the emergence of male turtles.|$|E
