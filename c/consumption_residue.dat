Some flavonoids from natural plants {{have been found to}} possess inhibitory effects on harmful advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). However, few studies paid attention to effects of these natural AGE inhibitors on the Maillard reaction happening under thermal conditions. In the present work, we aimed to investigate effects of the two apple phenols, phloretin and phloridzin, on the Maillard reaction taking place in both thermal and non-thermal models. It was found that either phloretin or phloridzin could inhibit the formation of Maillard-type volatiles in various thermal Maillard model systems (glucose-lysine, glucose-lysine derivatives with α-amino group blocked, and ribose-cysteine, respectively). In addition, both phloretin and phloridzin could obviously affect color development induced by Maillard reaction. For the study of non-thermal Maillard reaction, effects of phloretin and phloridzin were evaluated in methylglyoxal (MGO) -induced glycation systems consisting of amino acids, peptides and protein (creatine kinase), respectively. Arginine residue was found as an active site for glycation, and the addition of phloretin and phloridzin could significantly inhibit the arginine-site glycation. Interestingly, the addition of phloretin could promote the <b>consumption</b> of cysteine <b>residue</b> exposed to MGO, while cysteine residue kept unchanged when incubated solely with MGO. The promoting effect of phloretin on cysteine <b>residue</b> <b>consumption</b> is caused by the condensation reaction among phloretin, MGO and cysteine residue.

Here we explore several methods to infer foods most strongly associated with concentrations of these metals observed in the duplicate diet in our data set. We employed two techniques in which logarithmically transformed metal concentrations in the duplicate diet were regressed on individual food item consumption using algorithms designed to identify the foods most associated with the observed duplicate diet concentrations. We also employed an alternative strategy in which foods to be used as independent variables in regression were selected using data collected in national food <b>consumption</b> and <b>residue</b> surveys, with regression procedures proceeding with the selected foods in a similar manner. The concordance of foods selected as major predictors among these three techniques is noteworthy and is discussed.

The available data indicate the self-sufficiency of the settlement in both forestry and agricultural products throughout the period investigated {{from the end of the}} 1 st century BC to the beginning of the 4 th century AD. Charcoal data testify to the presence of a Quercus suber forest in the close surroundings of the site and its exploitation for a variety of forestry products such as timber, fuelwood, cork, and probably also leaves and acorns to feed livestock. The overwhelming presence of Q. suber in the archaeological layer investigated clearly indicates that this forest was under human influence prior to Roman occupation and was already partially degraded. Charred seed and fruit remains suggest that the diet of both troops and civilians was mainly based on locally grown products and that all the inhabitants of the site had access to good cereals such as barley, naked wheats and pulses with large seeds such as horse bean and pea; quality fruits, such as olive and grape, were also produced locally for fresh <b>consumption.</b> Organic <b>residue</b> analyses of the contents of ceramic vessels and plastered vats allowed archaeobotanical data to be complemented, thereby shedding light on some of the imports at Thamusida.

Human exposure and the unintentional <b>consumption</b> of <b>residues</b> of drugs can lead to side effects and development of resistant bacteria, representing a considerable concern to consumer health. This paper presents the occurrence of residues of veterinary drugs in milk from 2009 to 2011 in Brazil, monitored by the Official Program for Analysis of Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods of Animal Origin. A total of 961 samples were collected in the retail and evaluated for the main β-lactams, tetracyclines, amphenicol, aminoglycosides, quinolones, sulfonamides and avermectins. Residues of veterinary drugs did not exceed maximum residue limit (MRL); although, there is a considerable use of critically/highly important antimicrobials and avermectins in dairy cows, especially quinolones and tetracyclines. Doxycycline (9 %) and abamectin (1. 6 %) were detected, even though these substances are {{not intended to be}} used in milk producing animals for human consumption. Norfloxacin (15 %) was observed; although, there are no MRL established, consequently, no residue level should have been detected. No residues of streptomycin, chloramphenicol and β-lactams were confirmed. Milk in Brazil contains low levels of veterinary drugs so that toxicological risk regarding milk consumption could not be considered as a public health concern. However, {{due to the nature of}} the samples, which correspond to milk from several farms, it could occur a dilution effect. The absence of MRL established for norfloxacin prevents suitable interpretation of the findings and makes tough the control of these chemical residues in food.

Frutose/glucose ratio can influence the flavor of honey since fructose is sweeter than glucose. Honeys with higher fructose/glucose ratios remain liquid for longer periods. Several Chromatographic methods have been used to evaluate the sugar content of honey, although the Integrated Pulsed Amperometric Detection (IPAD) only recently became to be used. In order to characterize the sugar content in honey from different botanical origins a Dionex ICS 3000 ion chromatograph was used. Separation was performed in a column “CarboPacTM PA 20 3 x 150 mm”, with a precolumn “CarboPacTM PA 20 3 x 30 mm”. Electrochemical detector in Integrated Pulsed Amperometric Detection (IPAD) mode was used. The elution was performed with a gradient with two NaOH solutions (10 and 200 mM). Standard solutions of glucose, fructose and sucrose, were used to identify and quantify the individual sugar components in the honey samples. The method showed a good separation between the compounds (resolution> 3. 3 and more than 9000 theoretical plates). The response was linear in the range (0. 05 to 1. 00 mg/L for fructose and glucose and 0. 01 to 0. 20 mg/L for sucrose). The detection limits were 0. 014 mg/L for glucose, 0. 007 mg/L for fructose and 0. 003 mg/L for sucrose. Twenty six monofloral honey samples from Erica, Citrus, Lavandula and Eucalyptus were tested. 5, 000 g of each honey sample was diluted to 1 mg/L and filtered with a 0. 45 m polypropylene filter prior to HPLC analysis.

About 20 years ago, a French physician, J. de Leobardy, attributed liver disorders to drinking wines made from native eastern United States grapes or from hybrid grapes (crosses of French and American varieties). After feeding various wines to hens, rats, guinea pigs, pigs, and goats, with subsequent organ histologic examinations, the only diseased conditions were found in the chickens. Fowl tuberculosis was observed, which de Leobardy and Loubet (8) claimed was coincident to the experiment and not attributable to the wine intake.

In fire-adapted grassland and shrubland ecosystems, prescribed fires are used for habitat restoration and endangered species conservation (Hamman et al. 2011). Concerns about potentially detrimental effects of burning on diapausing butterfly larvae near the soil surface, as well as other ground-dwelling arthropods and bryophyte and lichen communities, however, can sometimes inhibit the implementation of restoration treatments (Fimbel 2004, Hamman et al. 2011, Schultz et al. 2011, Calabria et al. 2016). These organisms are more likely to survive a fire in areas that experience lower soil temperatures during the burn or in unburned and low-severity patches (Bradstock et al. 2005, New 2014). Conducting prescribed fires during cooler and more humid weather can help promote these conditions (Knapp and Keeley 2006). This analysis focuses on the relationship between weather and fuel conditions and several response variables that serve as metrics of the risk to fire-sensitive organisms near the soil surface during prescribed fires.|$|R

Bioethanol production could be the best alternate for the <b>consumption</b> of agricultural <b>residues.</b> Use of banana stem as a substrate for bioethanol production is a good alternate in India because of huge availability of banana pseudo stem as a waste. Ingale et al. (2014) produced bioethanol by using banana pseudo stem as a substrate with pre-treatment of Aspergillus ellipticus and Aspergillus fumigatus. Maiti et al. (2016) used agro-industrial waste for the production of butanol by using Clostridium beijerinckii. The maximum butanol, i.e., 11.04  g/l was produced after 96  h of fermentation from the agro-industrial waste starch industry wastewater (SIW). So, the use of inexpensive and ecological agricultural waste for the production of valuable biofuels is a better pathway for the fulfillment of requirement of energy through limited resources.|$|R
40|$|Reliable, {{evaluated}} {{human exposure}} and dose models {{are important for}} understanding the health risks from chemicals. A case study focusing on permethrin was conducted because of this insecticide's widespread use and potential health effects. SHEDS-Multimedia was applied to estimate US population permethrin exposures for 3 - to 5 -year-old children from residential, dietary, and combined exposure routes, using available dietary <b>consumption</b> data, food <b>residue</b> data, residential concentrations, and exposure factors. Sensitivity and uncertainty {{analyses were conducted to}} identify key factors, pathways, and research needs. Model evaluation was conducted using duplicate diet data and biomonitoring data from multiple field studies, and comparison to other models. Key exposure variables were consumption of spinach, lettuce, and cabbage; surface-to-skin transfer efficiency; hand mouthing frequency; fraction of hand mouthed; saliva removal efficiency; fraction of house treated; and usage frequency. For children in households using residential permethrin, the non-dietary exposure route was most important, and when all households were included, dietary exposure dominated. SHEDS-Multimedia model estimates compared well to real-world measurements data; this exposure assessment tool can enhance human health risk assessments and inform children's health research. The case study provides insights into children's aggregate exposures to permethrin and lays the foundation for a future cumulative pyrethroid pesticides risk assessment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractExposure {{of heavy}} metals {{to human beings}} has risen {{dramatically}} in the last 50 years. In today’s urban and industrial society, there is no escaping from exposure to toxic chemicals and heavy metals. Humans {{are more likely to}} be exposed to heavy metal contamination from the dust that adheres to edible plants than from bioaccumulation. This is because it is very difficult to wash off all the dust particles from the plant material before ingesting them. The objectives of this experiment were to determine the concentrations of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) in washing residues and in the tissues of fruits of date palm growing in 14 sites of Riyadh and also to assess whether the fruits were safe for human <b>consumption.</b> The washing <b>residues</b> and tissue of date palm fruits collected from different sites showed the presence of significant amounts of the Pb and Cd. The concentration of Pb in the dust and fruit tissue increased with increasing anthropogenic sources. Therefore, fruits of date palm might be used as a pollution indicator; it might be recommend that fruits of date palm could be safe for human consumption after washing. The mean concentration of Pb and Cd in all the samples collected from different sites is within the safe limits recommended by FAO/WHO...|$|R

(2013) {{proposed}} a kinetic model for atmospheric residue hydroconversion wherein <b>residue</b> <b>consumption</b> rate depends on residue and dissolved hydrogen concentrations. In the present work, a new kinetic study {{was carried out}} in a semi-batch reactor at 420 and 430 °C, total pressure of 15 MPa and different reaction times (0, 30, 60 and 120 min). Nguyen’s kinetic model was improved by introducing a hydrodesulfurization (HDS) reaction and modeling the gas flow dynamics at the outlet of the semi-batch reactor. A new set of kinetic parameters for atmospheric residue hydroconversion has been estimated using a nonlinear least-squares regression on the total mass of products and the dynamics of outlet gas flow. In comparison to Nguyen’s kinetic study performed in a batch reactor, {{the results of the present}} work do not show any mass transfer limitation for H 2 from gas to liquid in the semi-batch reactor. A high value of kLa was obtained confirming the high efficiency of this kind of apparatus to estimate the kinetic parameters. Moreover, the differences found between the values of kinetic parameters obtained in both batch and semi-batch reactors were explained by a free radical kinetic model...|$|R
40|$|The European Union {{has set a}} 10 % {{target for}} the share of {{renewable}} energy in the transportation sector for 2020. To reach this target, second generation biofuels from, for example, forest residues are expected to replace around 3 % of the transport fossil fuel <b>consumption.</b> However, forest <b>residues</b> could also be utilised in the heat and electricity sectors where large amounts of fossil fuels can be replaced, thus reducing global fossil CO 2 emissions. This study investigates the use of forest residues or second generation biofuel (ethanol or methanol) or {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) production at the European level, with focus on the influence of different economic policy instruments, such as carbon cost or biofuel policy support. A techno-economic, geographically explicit optimisation model is used. The model determines the optimal locations of bioenergy conversion plants by minimising the cost of the entire supply chain. The results show that in order to reach a 3 % second generation biofuel share, a biofuel support comparable to today's tax exemptions would be needed. With a carbon cost applied, most available forest residues would be allocated to CHP production, with a substantial resulting CO 2 emission reduction potential. The major potential for woody biomass and biofuel production is found in the region around the Baltic Sea, with Italy as one of the main biofuel importers...|$|R
40|$|An initial {{census of}} layer farms in Khartoum State, Sudan, {{was carried out}} in late 2007 and early 2008 and found that there were 252 layer farms with a total {{population}} of 2 221 800 birds. This paper reports the findings of the census. Based on this information, a structured questionnaire survey of 92 farms was then conducted in the state in April 2008 to collect data on antibiotic usage, demographic data and public health awareness. Ninety-eight per cent of participating farms comprised open-sided houses. It was found that 49 % of the farms surveyed were on antibiotic treatment when the survey was conducted, whilst 59 % of the farms had used antibiotics within the last 3 months. The study found that farmers and producers had a lack of knowledge about antimicrobial residues, their withdrawal periods and the risk posed by the <b>consumption</b> of these <b>residues.</b> The study also concluded that traditional farming systems in Sudan relied heavily on antimicrobial medication to control disease and almost half of the farms surveyed were treating their flocks with antimicrobials. In addition to this, {{there was a lack of}} disease control programmes which probably resulted in a massive use of antibiotics to control endemic diseases. This was further compounded by the absence of governmental supervision and control on the use of drugs.
