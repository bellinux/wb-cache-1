25|$|As {{a social}} being, man {{is part of}} a greater harmony, and, in order that he may {{contribute}} to the happiness of the whole, he must order his extra-regarding activities so that they shall not clash with his environs. Only when he has regulated his Internal and his social relations by this ideal <b>can</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> regarded as rule moral. The egoist and the altruist are both imperfect. In the ripe perfection of humanity, the two impulses will be perfectly adjusted.|$|E
25|$|According to Madhva, God, {{although}} He has control, {{does not}} interfere with Man's free will; although He is omnipotent, {{that does not mean}} that He engages in extraordinary feats. Rather, God enforces a rule of law and, in accordance with the just deserts of jivas, gives them freedom to follow their own nature. Thus, God functions as the sanctioner or as the divine accountant, and accordingly jivas are free to work according to their innate nature and their accumulated karma, good and bad. Since God acts as the sanctioner, the ultimate power for everything comes from God and the jiva only utilizes that power, according to his/her innate nature. However, like Shankara's interpretation of the Brahma Sutras as mentioned earlier, Madhva, agrees that the rewards and punishments bestowed by God are regulated by Him in accordance with the good and sinful deeds performed by them, and He does so of out of His own will to keep himself firm in justice and he cannot be controlled in His actions by karma of human beings nor <b>can</b> <b>He</b> <b>be</b> accused of partiality or cruelty to anyone.|$|E

2500|$|Chen Shou, {{who wrote}} Zhong Hui's {{biography}} in the Records of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi), commented {{on him as}} follows: [...] "Zhong Hui was a brilliant strategist and was famous for his various talents, which helped him rise to high positions.

Ferguson showed no emotion as he sat in the back of a police car, which some passengers said was as shocking and disturbing as the violence of the shooting itself.

2500|$|For a biographer Moore's {{practice}} of various professions can be confusing. Is he a poet, an ex-dancer, a {{radio and television}} voice and image, a filmmaker, a TV executive, a peace activist, a family man, a withdrawn loner? Perhaps the best answer is, [...] "None of the above." [...] Yet a single thread runs through all of Richard O. Moore's [...] "incarnations:" [...] he began as, has continued to be, and remains a poet. He is not an academic, a critic, nor <b>can</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> identified exclusively with any group of poets. There is an obvious irony {{in the fact that}} Moore's poetry would likely have disappeared without notice {{had it not been for}} the insistence of Brenda Hillman. When asked about this he agreed, but added, [...] "You know, poetry is what had kept me going. It has saved my life." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the Series 6 premiere, [...] "The Impossible Astronaut", {{a future}} {{version of the}} Eleventh Doctor is shot twice by the titular {{astronaut}} and begins to regenerate. However he is then shot again and dies, showing that not only <b>can</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> killed before regeneration, but also during the process (However, the later revelation, in [...] "The Wedding of River Song" [...] that what was shot {{was in fact a}} mechanical avatar of the Doctor and not the real person calls this into question). In the episode [...] "Let's Kill Hitler", the Doctor is poisoned by River Song which disables the ability to regenerate and he seemingly dies, although he is later revived when River gives up her remaining regenerations to save him. [...] "The Time of the Doctor" [...] later shows that the Doctor did not have any remaining regenerations at this time anyway.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time as a comet appears in the western skies, Alric orders the {{majority}} of the surviving members of the Legion, twenty-two hundred men, to launch a frontal attack on Balor's fortress in a suicide mission designed to cause a distraction, as he takes the remaining one-hundred men through a World Knot (a teleportation device) to a spot behind the fortress. As they near the fortress, Alric tells the stunned soldiers that Balor is in fact Connacht, and with this in mind, he intends to raise the Myrkridian battle standard found in the Tain, hoping to enrage Balor into making a tactical error. The plan works; furious {{at the sight of the}} flag, Balor leaves the fortress, and Alric immobilizes him with an Eblis Stone. The Legion decapitate him, and take his head to a bottomless pit known as [...] "The Great Devoid", as only by throwing his head into the Devoid <b>can</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> destroyed. The thirty remaining members of The Legion are ambushed by Soulblighter as they approach the Devoid, but they fight their way through, and fling the head into the pit. Soulblighter turns into a murder of crows and flees, moments before a massive explosion erupts from within the Devoid. With Balor's destruction, the remaining Fallen are rendered powerless, and their armies collapse, bringing to an end the war between the Light and the Dark.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s {{a fierce}} {{interchange}} {{took place between}} Gardner and Colin Wilson. [...] In The Quest for Wilhelm Reich Wilson wrote of this book(Gardner) writes about various kinds of cranks with the conscious superiority of the scientist, {{and in most cases}} one can share his sense of the victory of reason. But after half a dozen chapters this non-stop superiority begins to irritate; you begin to wonder about the standards that make him so certain he is always right. He asserts that the scientist, unlike the crank, does his best to remain open-minded. So how <b>can</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> so sure that no sane person has ever seen a flying saucer, or used a dowsing rod to locate water? And that all the people he disagrees with are unbalanced fanatics? A colleague of the positivist philosopher A. J. Ayer once remarked wryly [...] "I wish I was as certain of anything as he seems to be about everything". Martin Gardner produces the same feeling. By Wilson's own account, up to that time he and Gardner had been friends, but Gardner took offence. In February 1989 Gardner wrote a letter published in The New York Review of Books describing Wilson as [...] "England’s leading journalist of the occult, and a firm believer in ghosts, poltergeists, levitations, dowsing, PK (psychokinesis), ESP, and every other aspect of the psychic scene". Shortly afterwards, Wilson replied, defending himself and adding [...] "What strikes me as so interesting is that when Mr. Gardner—and his colleagues of CSICOP—begin to denounce the 'Yahoos of the paranormal,' they manage to generate an atmosphere of such intense hysteria ...". Gardner in turn replied quoting his own earlier description of Wilson: [...] "The former boy wonder, tall and handsome in his turtleneck sweater, has now decayed into one of those amiable eccentrics for which the land of Conan Doyle is noted. They prowl comically about the lunatic fringes of science ..." ...|$|E
