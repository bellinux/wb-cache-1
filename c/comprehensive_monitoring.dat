2500|$|The Federal Resources and Energy Minister Martin Ferguson {{opened the}} first geosequestration {{project in the}} {{southern}} hemisphere in April 2008. The demonstration plant is near Nirranda South in South Western Victoria. (...) The plant {{is owned by the}} Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC). CO2CRC is a non profit research collaboration supported by government and industry. The project has stored and monitored over 65,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide-rich gas which was extracted from a natural gas reservoir via a well, compressed and piped 2.25km to a new well. There the gas has been injected into a depleted natural gas reservoir approximately two kilometers below the surface. The project has moved to a second stage and is investigating carbon dioxide trapping in a saline aquifer 1500 meters below the surface. The Otway Project is a research and demonstration project, focused on <b>comprehensive</b> <b>monitoring</b> and verification.|$|E

40|$|Airway {{pressure}} {{is currently the}} primary indicator of respiratory mechanics used by the anesthetist in the operating room. This quantity can signal that the mechanical properties of the respiratory system have changed. However, {{there is a need}} for more sophisticated monitors of mechanics, capable of indicating the nature of the change. We have investigated the use of the tidal flow-volume loop in differentiating between an obstruction of the endotracheal tube and changes in the distribution of regional ventilation, using a computer model. Endotracheal obstruction caused the descending limb of flow-volume loop to become convex to the volume axis, whereas ventilation inhomogeneity caused the curve to become concave to the volume axis. In contrast, examination of peak airway pressure did not allow differentiation between the two conditions. We conclude that, while the peak airway {{pressure is}} useful in signaling a change in a patient 2 ̆ 7 s condition, the combination of airway pressure and the flow-volume loop serves as a more <b>comprehensive</b> <b>monitor</b> of respiratory mechanics...|$|R
