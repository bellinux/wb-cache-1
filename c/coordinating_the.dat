In the twenty first century the Office has focussed on underserviced women.

5|$|Raphel was {{instrumental}} in <b>coordinating</b> <b>the</b> State Department's establishment of diplomatic relations with the Taliban shortly after its takeover of Kabul. A senior Unocal executive commented that the pipeline project would be far easier to implement with the Taliban in control, {{in reference to the}} need for central control in Afghanistan to undertake a project of the size, complexity and cost the Texas-based oil giant was considering. Unocal's consortium also included Saudi Arabia's Delta Oil, Pakistan's Crescent Group and Gazprom of Russia. The project involved building an 890-kilometer gas pipeline that would carry 1.9 billion cubic feet of gas to Pakistan each day. Unocal held detailed discussions with Taliban representatives in Houston in December 1997, striking a deal that would later collapse under the weight of rising U.S. and Afghan domestic political pressures against the Taliban's record on human rights, education and treatment of women.|$|E
