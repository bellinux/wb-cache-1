Birds are partial to the introduced Scotch thistle (Onopordum acanthium).|$|E
50|$|Xanthium strumarium var. canadense (Canada <b>cockleburr),</b> The chewed {{seeds are}} rubbed onto the body before the cactus {{ceremony}} {{to protect it}} from vines. A compound poultice of seeds is applied to wounds or used to remove splinters. The seeds are also ground, mixed with cornmeal, made into cakes, and steamed for food.|$|E
50|$|Wetherby-Hampton-Snyder-Wilson-Erdman Log House, {{also known}} as <b>Cockleburr,</b> Prologue House, and Cabindale, is a {{historic}} home located in Tredyffrin Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania. The original section was built about 1725, and is a -story, 2-bay dwelling. The first story is of slate and the upper stories of log construction. A -story stone wing was added between 1817 and 1835. A -story rear wing was added in the 20th century.|$|E
60|$|When {{the second}} invoice of <b>cockleburrs</b> arrived Johnny loaded {{them and the}} {{remainder}} of the shoes into a schooner, and sailed down the coast to Alazan.|$|R
6000|$|Draft for $100 {{comes to}} you next mail. Ship me {{immediately}} [...] 500 pounds stiff, dry <b>cockleburrs.</b> New use here in arts. [...] Market price twenty cents pound. Further orders likely. [...] Rush.|$|R
50|$|Swiss {{electrical}} engineer George de Mestral invented his first touch fastener when, in 1941, {{he went for}} a walk in the woods and wondered why <b>cockleburrs</b> clung to his coat and dog. He discovered it could be turned into something useful. He patented it in 1955 and subsequently refined and developed its practical manufacture until its commercial introduction in the late 1950s.|$|R
40|$|Diaporthe/Phomopsis sp. was {{isolated}} from Xanthium italicum (Italian <b>cockleburr)</b> {{for the first}} time in Eastern Croatia during 2004 year. As Diaporthe/Phomopsis species are known as pathogens of soybean, sunflower and other arable crops, it is important to study alternative hosts as a possible source of inoculum from an epidemiological point of view. This paper describes symptoms of infection on X. italicum, pathogen morphological and cultural characters on potato-dextrose agar (PDA), biometrical values of reproductive structures (pycnidia, beta conidia, perithecia, asci and ascospores) of naturally infected plants and of cultures grown on PDA. Results obtained from undertaken studies indicate that our Phomopsis sp. isolates from X. italicum belong to the group of P. helianthi...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the roles of common weeds in the survival of Verticillium dahliae and the incidence of cotton wilt disease in Moghan and Neishabour area of Iran during 2003 - 2005 cropping seasons. The design of the experiment was Randomized Complete Blocks (RCB) with ten treatments (No. of weeds) and four replications (No. of cotton fields). Populations of V. dahliae in the roots of weeds and their surrounding soil was determined every year and were compared in different treatments. The cotton wilt disease index was also evaluated in different fields in each experimental site. Results indicated that the fungal population was variable depending on weed species, experimental site and the year of study. In general, Pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), Nightshde (Solanum nigrum), Spiny <b>cockleburr</b> (Xanthium spinosum) and common purslane (Portulaca oleraceea) showed the highest fungal populations in their roots and surrounding soil. Disease index in Moghan cotton fields in different years varied and were higher than Neishabour fields...|$|E
60|$|That {{night he}} ripped open {{a corner of}} it {{and took out a}} handful of the <b>cockleburrs.</b> He {{examined}} them with the care with which a warrior examines his arms before he goes forth to battle for his lady-love and life. The burrs were the ripe August product, as hard as filberts, and bristling with spines as tough and sharp as needles. Johnny whistled softly a little tune, and went out to find Billy Keogh.|$|R
60|$|Each night Johnny and Keogh sowed {{the crop}} that grew dollars by day. At {{the end of}} ten days two-thirds of the stock of shoes had been sold; and the stock of <b>cockleburrs</b> was exhausted. Johnny cabled to Pink Dawson for another 500 pounds, paying twenty cents per pound as before. Mr. Hemstetter {{carefully}} made up an order for $1500 worth of shoes from Northern firms. Johnny hung about the store until this order {{was ready for the}} mail, and succeeded in destroying it before it reached the postoffice.|$|R
50|$|And {{then the}} man hooked a fish. My mother called to the angler, and gave me {{permission}} to run and see his prize. I remember getting my feet muddy and wet, with a Biblical plague of <b>cockleburrs</b> at my ankles, {{but it did not}} matter. The fish was still in the man’s landing met, and he raised it dripping and shining in his hand. It was a brook trout of six inches, its dorsal surfaces drak with blue and olive vermiculations, and its flanks clouded with dusky parr markings. Its belly and lower fins were a bright tangerine, with edgings of alabaster and ebony, and it glowed like a jeweler’s tray of opals and moonstones and rubies. I had witnessed something beautiful, and I {{wanted to be part of}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{the factory}} where they use them <b>cockleburrs.</b> Lord {{knows what they}} use 'em for, anyway! I've got the basements of both them ships out there loaded with 'em. I'll give you a bargain in this lot. I've had every man, woman and child around Dalesburg that wasn't busy pickin' 'em for a month. I hired these ships to bring 'em over. Everybody thought I was crazy. Now, you can have this lot for fifteen cents a pound, {{delivered}} on land. And {{if you want more}} I guess old Alabam' can come up to the demand. Johnny told me when he left home that if he struck anything down here that there was any money in he'd let me in on it. Shall I drive the ships in and hitch?" ...|$|R
