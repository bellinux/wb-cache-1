In the 1930s it underwent X-ray and ultraviolet examination {{for the first}} time, led by a team which included the art historian Wilhelm Suida. He concluded that the Christ child and the landscape were by Leonardo and the remainder was by a Milanese pupil. During a loan to the New York World’s Fair in 1939 the {{painting was}} damaged and further restoration work had to be undertaken. Reford’s family put it up for auction in 1972, but by then the attribution had reverted to Sodoma, inevitably resulting in a lower price than had it been accepted as a Leonardo. It was bought back by Wildenstein & Company, who arranged {{for it to be}} transferred a second time, this time onto a <b>composite</b> <b>panel,</b> in 1976. They sold the Madonna (as a Leonardo) to its current owner, an anonymous private collector, in 1999.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{vibration}} and sound radiation by panels exited by turbulent flow and by random noise. <b>Composite</b> and aluminum <b>panels</b> are analyzed through a developed analytical framework. The main {{objective of this}} study is to identify the difference between the vibroacoustic behaviour of these two types of panels.

40|$|Abstract. In this work, the Fe-based {{amorphous}} powder/S-glass fiber reinforced epoxy <b>composite</b> <b>panels</b> {{of different}} amorphous powder and gradient layer structure were prepared by mould pressing method. The waveguide method and arch form method {{can be used}} to measure the electromagnetic parameters and the reflectivity of the samples respectively in the frequency range from 2 GHz to 18 GHz. The results showed that the amorphous powders distributed evenly during the S-glass fiber reinforced epoxy layers and the main absorbing mechanism of <b>composite</b> <b>panels</b> is magnetic loss. The absorbing properties of samples improve with the increase of the Fe-based amorphous powder contents and the thickness of panels. The model of gradient layer structure has a significantly effect to improve the impedance matching between the samples and the air. Thus, the absorbing properties of the <b>composite</b> <b>panels</b> can be increased effectively. When the thickness of the gradient layer structure <b>composite</b> <b>panels</b> is designed at 4. 8 mm excepting the Al plate thickness with 0. 6 ~ 1. 3 mm thickness of Fe-based amorphous powder/S-glass fiber reinforced epoxy, the absolute value of the reflection coefficient of the multi-composite panels is above 4 dB in the frequency ranged from 2 GHz to 8 GHz and above 10 dB during 8 GHz ~ 18 GHz...|$|R
