Forty specimens were prepared from SureFill and SonicFill bulk fill composite resins, 20 each. All specimens were stored dry for 24 [*]h.

40|$|The <b>crosslink</b> <b>density</b> plays a {{key role}} in the {{mechanical}} response of the amorphous polymers in previous experiments. However, the mechanism of the influence is still not clear. In this paper, the influence of <b>crosslink</b> <b>density</b> on the failure behavior under tension and shear in amorphous polymers is systematically studied using molecular dynamics simulations. The present results indicate that the ultimate stresses and the broken ratios (the broken bond number to all polymer chain number ratios) increase, as well as the ultimate strains decrease with increasing <b>crosslink</b> <b>density.</b> The strain concentration is clearer with the increase of <b>crosslink</b> <b>density.</b> In other words, a higher <b>crosslink</b> <b>density</b> leads to a higher strain concentration.

40|$|Much {{controversy}} {{surrounds the}} dependence of stress intensity factor of glassy thermosets, epoxies in particular, with <b>crosslink</b> <b>density.</b> One could scan the literature and find references that claim K{sub Ic} increases with <b>crosslink</b> <b>density,</b> decreases with <b>crosslink</b> <b>density,</b> or is independent of <b>crosslink</b> <b>density.</b> The authors feel that two factors contribute to this confusion. First, a typical method for assessing this dependence relies on modifying the <b>crosslink</b> <b>density</b> by changing the precursor epoxy molecular weight. On the other hand, one could change stoichiometry or quench the reaction at intermediate extents of reaction to obtain large changes in <b>crosslink</b> <b>density.</b> However, most studies have not measured the resulting stress intensity factor of these partially cured systems at constant T-T{sub g}, where T{sub g} is the glass transition temperature of the epoxy. Since T{sub g} can change significantly with cure and since fracture processes at the crack tip are dissipative, they must work at constant T-T{sub g} {{to ensure that the}} nonlinear viscoelastic mechanisms are fairly compared. In this study, they quenched the reaction of the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and diethanolamine (DEA) at various stages past the gel point and measured the three-point-bend stress intensity factor at a constant T-T{sub g} = {minus} 50 C.

The polyaddition forms {{much more quickly}} high molecular weight polymers than the transesterification does and in contrast to polyorthoester type I no small molecules are released. For the reaction, the monomers are dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and small amounts of an acidic catalyst are added, e. g. p-toluenesulfonic acid. The molecular weight of the polymers can be controlled by the molar ratio of the reactants. The addition of triols leads to crosslinked polymers, whereas the <b>crosslinking</b> <b>density</b> {{is determined by the}} ratio of triol/diol.

50|$|Some of {{the types}} of {{permanent}} coatings include those based on polyurethanes, nano-particles, fluorinated hydrocarbons, or siloxanes. Polyurethane coatings are useful because of their barrier properties. High chain stiffness and high <b>crosslinking</b> <b>density</b> reduces the ability of the polymer to swell and absorb graffiti paint.Fluorinated coatings {{are some of the most}} effective in the field of graffiti prevention. Fluorine is the most electronegative element, meaning that it shows very little affinity for the electrons of other elements. When fluorine is attached to a surface it will decrease surface energy at the interface, minimizing the contact with the graffiti paint. For the same reason that a Teflon-coated pan repels both water and oil, a fluorinated coating will repel water and oil-based paints. These coatings also have the added benefit of being chemically inert as well as very durable. They are also expensive and can be difficult to apply.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of type I collagen gel vary due to different polymerization parameters. In this work, {{the role of}} crosslinks in terms of density and stiffness on the macroscopic behavior of collagen gel were investigated through computational modeling. The collagen fiber network was developed in a representative volume element, which used the inter-fiber spacing to regulate the <b>crosslink</b> <b>density.</b> The obtained tensile behavior of collagen gel was validated against published experimental data. Results suggest that the cross-linked fiber alignment dominated the strain stiffening effect of the collagen gel. In addition, the gel stiffness was enhanced approximately 40 times as the <b>crosslink</b> <b>density</b> doubled. The non-affine deformation was reduced with the increased <b>crosslink</b> <b>density.</b> A positive bilinear correlation between the <b>crosslink</b> <b>density</b> and gel stiffness was obtained. On the other hand, the crosslink stiffness had much less impact on the gel stiffness. This work could enhance our understanding of collagen gel mechanics and shed lights on designing future clinical relevant biomaterials with better control of polymerization parameters...|$|R
30|$|The {{values of}} gel content and <b>crosslink</b> <b>density</b> {{for all the}} {{crosslinked}} gels are tabulated in Table 2. With the increase in sulfur to accelerator ratio, both gel content and <b>crosslink</b> <b>density</b> increase for SBS as well NS gel systems. SBS 0.5 has a gel content of 89 %, which increases up to 97 % in SBS 3. A similar trend is also observed for <b>crosslink</b> <b>density</b> (0.8 × 10 − 4 gmol/cc for SB 0.5 to 2.4 × 10 − 4 gmol/cc for SB 3). A comparable increase in gel content and <b>crosslink</b> <b>density</b> is observed for NR gels. The increment in gel content and <b>crosslink</b> <b>density</b> values with increasing sulfur to accelerator ratio {{can be attributed to}} the formation of sulfide linkages between the molecules, which lead to a three-dimensional network structure. However, as the sulfur to accelerator ratio increases from 2 to 3, the increase in the amount of crosslinking tends to level off, as evident from gel content and <b>crosslink</b> <b>density</b> values of SBS 2 /SBS 3 and NS 2 /NS 3 systems. This is because of the saturation of sites available for crosslinking. Although the gel content values are quite close for both SBS and NS types of gels at any given sulfur to accelerator ratio, SBR gels show almost double the amount of crosslinking than their NR gel counterparts. Because of the nano size of SBR latex particles compared to the NR latex, higher available surface area in nano latex particle leads to the efficient diffusion of these curing agents during prevulcanization and hence higher amount of crosslinking.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{discussed the}} influenced of different preparation methods of Carrageenan fillers as new natural biodegradable additives in Natural Rubber (NR) latex compound. NR latex compounds with addition of 2 phr Carrageenan fillers was prepared through normal pre-vulcanization method which the NR latex compound {{was subjected to}} 70 oC denoted as Method 1. The preparation of NR latex compounds with 2 phr Carrageenan fillers without temperature is denoted as Method 2. The unfilled NR Latex films also was prepared as a control through Method 1. The <b>crosslink</b> <b>density</b> and mechanical properties of NR Latex films were investigated via swelling test and mechanical testing (tensile and tear) respectively. The swelling test results shows that Method 2 have highest <b>crosslink</b> <b>density</b> where the <b>crosslink</b> <b>density</b> and mechanical properties via Method 1 shows a decreased value. This may contribute from the hydration of carrageenan at temperature of 40 oC- 70 oC. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} addition of carrageenan with elimination of pre-vulcanization step is mainly responsible for the enhancement of <b>crosslink</b> <b>density</b> and mechanical properties compared to Method 1. Method 2 gives higher <b>crosslink</b> <b>density,</b> tear strength and lower modulus as evaluated from the mechanical properties. Carrageenan can be added as natural filler in NR Latex films with gives better interaction between rubber matrix and fillers with softer NR latex films which required in NR latex products especially gloves...|$|R
