40|$|In April 2013 a 48 MVA {{submerged}} {{arc furnace}} producing silicomanganese was excavated in South Africa. Since the high shell temperatures {{recorded in the}} tap-hole area resulted in the furnace being switched out for relining, the tap-hole area was excavated systematically. A refractory wear profile of the tap-hole area with affected hearth and sidewall refractory was obtained in elevation. The <b>carbon</b> <b>ramming</b> paste in front of, above, and below the tap-hole was worn, as was the SiC with which the tap-hole was built. A clay mushroom formed but was detached from the refractories. Thermodynamic and mass-transfer calculations were conducted to quantify the potential for wear by chemical reaction between refractory and slag and refractory and metal in the tap-hole area. It was found that chemical reaction between refractory and slag or metal could offer only a partial explanation for the wear observed; erosion is expected to contribute significantly to wear.

40|$|Nanostructured radar {{absorbing}} materials (RAMs) {{have received}} steadily growing interest {{because of their}} fascinating properties and various applications compared with the bulk or microsized counterparts. The increased surface area, number of dangling bond atoms and unsaturated co-ordination on surface lead to interface polarization, multiple scatter and absorbing more microwave. In this paper, four types of nanostructured RAMs were concisely introduced as follows: nanocrystal RAMs, core-shell nanocomposite RAMs, nanocomposite of MWCNT and inorganic materials RAMs, nanocomposite of nanostructured <b>carbon</b> and polymer <b>RAMs.</b> Their microwave properties were described in detail by taking various materials as example...|$|R
40|$|Fatty acids {{with carbon}} chain lengths greater than 22 (VLCFA) have been {{detected}} in boar, ram, bull and human spermatozoa. Saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids were present in all spermatozoa but, except for human spermatozoa, polyenoic fatty acids were quantitatively the most important components. Marked differences in polyenoic fatty acid composition were observed. Whereas human spermatozoa contain predominantly di-, tri- and tetraenoic fatty acids with up to 32 <b>carbon</b> atoms, boar, <b>ram</b> and bull spermatozoa also contain pentaenoic and/or hexaenoic acids with up to 34 carbon atoms. Human and boar spermatozoa differ markedly {{from those of the}} ram and bull in that only n- 6 series acids are present...|$|R
40|$|The {{attributes}} of large-amplitude Fourier transformed AC voltammetry have been assessed at electrodes constructed from either a single carbon fiber microdisk or a random assembly of <b>carbon</b> fiber microdisks (<b>RAM).</b> Factors {{that govern the}} limits of detection for the FcMeOH and uric acid analytes have been established. For the reversible FcMeOH oxidation process, the RAM electrode provides the lower limit of detection through substantial amplification of the peak current magnitude, and hence superior faradaic current-to-noise ratio. In contrast for the overall two-electron oxidation of uric acid, the much faster electron transfer rate achieved at the electrochemically treated single carbon fiber microelectrode provides the lower detection limit, which is again optimal in the sixth harmonic. 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH 2 ̆ 6 Co.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study {{presented}} here is to determine to what extent chemical reactions between carbon-based refractory and slag or metal in the tap-hole of a SiMn furnace can contribute to wear of tap-hole refractory. The results of the study are reported in two parts. In Part I, thermodynamic calculations suggested that reaction between silicomanganese slag and carbon-based tap-hole refractory is possible, and experiments with nominally pure materials support this. However, practical refractory materials are by no means pure materials and contain secondary phases and porosity which can be expected to affect reaction with slag. In Part II, such reactions are examined experimentally, in cup and wettability tests, using commercially available carbon block and cold-ramming paste refractory materials and mainly industrial SiMn slag. Clear evidence was found of chemical reaction at approximately 1870 K (approximately 1600 C), forming SiC and, it appears, metal droplets. Both <b>carbon</b> block and <b>ramming</b> paste refractory reacted with slag, with preferential attack on and penetration into the binder phase rather than aggregate particles. The two types of carbon-based refractory materials showed similar extents of chemical reaction observed as wetting and penetration in the laboratory tests. The differences in refractory life observed practically in industrial furnaces should therefore be attributed to wear mechanisms other than pure chemical wear as studied in this work.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} {{presented}} here {{was to investigate the}} potential for chemical wear of carbon-based refractory materials in a silicomanganese furnace tap-hole. In the study, three research questions were addressed: 1. Is chemical reaction between refractory and slag or refractory and metal a potential wear mechanism? 2. Is the choice in carbon-based refractory material important from a tap-hole refractory life perspective? 3. What are the implications {{for the life of the}} tap-hole in a SiMn furnace? To study the potential for chemical wear, thermodynamic calculations were conducted to determine the potential for the formation of SiC and SiMn at 1600 °C through reduction of SiO 2 and MnO and dissolution of C (and subsequent reaction with Si) in metal. The thermodynamic calculations were based on published [1] metal and slag composition and carbon. Cup test experiments based on synthetic slag and graphite proved SiC formation conclusively, but not SiMn formation. To study the effect of the choice in carbon-based refractory material, two types of refractory materials – <b>carbon</b> block and <b>ramming</b> paste – available commercially and industrial slag were sourced, prepared and characterised. Wettability studies proved the formation of SiC at 1588 °C with slag being wetting towards refractory in an argon atmosphere and non-wetting in a CO-atmosphere. Under wetting conditions, the wetting angle of slag on carbon block was slightly higher (50 °) at holding temperature compared to that of ramming paste (30 °). Under non-wetting conditions the angles were 160 ° and 150 ° respectively. Cup test experiments based on industrial slag and carbon-based refractory material proved both SiC and SiMn formation at 1600 °C conclusively and confirmed the wetting behaviour of slag towards refractory at larger scale. To study the implications for the life of the tap-hole in a SiMn furnace, the tap-hole of a 48 MVA SiMn furnace was excavated and profiled. The wear predicted by thermodynamic modelling was supported by mass flow calculations. It was concluded that chemical reaction between carbon-based refractory materials and slag and metal is one of the mechanisms responsible for wear in the tap-hole of a silicomanganese furnace.
