With the reactor initially critical at 260 tained C and a power level of 0. 04 w, fuel solution at 100 tained C wse considered to enter the core at a flow rate of 150 gpm. With reversed flow this added reactivity at sn average rate of 1. 7 % o degradation t k/sub e// sec, while with upward flow the rate was 0. 67 % o degradation t k/sub e//sec. The core pressure incressed rapidly to a maxi-mum of 550 psi above normal operating pressure with reversed flow and 400 psi with upward flow when only the core pressurizer was available for fluid expansion. With the core and blanket pressurizers connected, the excess pressures were 375 and 210 psi, respectively. (auth...|$|E

From the simple wheelie bin {{with water and}} ice, to the inflatable baths with complex water cooling units to recovery sessions in the ocean, the practice of <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> immersion is wide and varied. Research into <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> immersion was conducted as early as 1963 when Clarke 1 examined the influence of <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> on performance recovery after a sustained handgrip exercise.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> immersion on muscle oxygenation and performance during repeated bouts of fatiguing exercise in a group of healthy young adults. Twenty healthy subjects performed 2 fatiguing bouts of maximal dynamic knee extension and flexion contractions both concentrically on an isokinetic dynamometer with a 10 -min recovery period in between. Subjects were randomly assigned to either a <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> immersion (treatment) or passive recovery (control) group. Changes in muscle oxygenation were monitored continuously using near-infrared spectroscopy. Muscle performance was measured with isokinetic dynamometry during each fatiguing bout. Skin temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and muscle soreness ratings were also assessed. Repeated measures ANOVA analysis was used to evaluate treatment effects. The treatment group had a significantly lower mean heart rate and lower skin temperature compared to the control group (P < 0. 05). <b>Cold</b> <b>water</b> immersion attenuated a reduction in tissue oxygenation in the second fatiguing bout by 4 % when compared with control.

Additional advancements in technology include pumps which cycle on and off to maintain hot water temperature versus a continuously operating pump which consumes more electrical energy. Reduced energy waste and discomfort is possible by preventing occurrences of hot water line siphoning in open-loop hot water circulation systems which utilize the <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> line to return water back to the water heater.
