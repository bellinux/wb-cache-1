40|$|Coiler drums are {{integral}} {{components of the}} Steckel mill reversing hot strip rolling process. A Steckel mill produces hot rolled strip steel from cast slabs, which are heated before being converted, via roughing, to a transfer bar, of which the thickness is subsequently reduced to the desired gauge {{by means of a}} reverse rolling process performed by the Steckel mill. Coiler drums are located inside two Steckel furnaces, which are positioned {{on both sides of the}} mill stand. As the strip thickness is reduced during each pass, the length increases. In order to obtain high rolling speeds and retain temperature, the strip is successively coiled and uncoiled, under tension, onto and from the heated coiler drums during processing. As coiler drums have a high unit cost and a significant impact on the quality of the finished product, <b>coiler</b> <b>drum</b> performance is important to Steckel mill operators. The high cost is associated with the high alloy composition of the casting and the specialised manufacturing process required for the production of coiler drums. Deterioration of the <b>coiler</b> <b>drum</b> condition over its service lifespan can adversely affect the quality of the final product, namely coiled strip. This investigation was therefore undertaken to gain insight into <b>coiler</b> <b>drum</b> failure mechanisms, which will benefit Steckel mill operators, mill suppliers and <b>coiler</b> <b>drum</b> suppliers.

40|$|Abstract––FEM is {{the method}} of choice in all types of {{analysis}} in structural mechanics i. e. solving for deformation and stresses in solid bodies or dynamics of structures. The most attractive feature of the FEM {{is its ability to}} handle complicated geometries and boundaries with relative ease. This paper presents the insight of stress analysis in a bolted joint of <b>Coiler</b> <b>Drum</b> in Steckel Mill under load and high temperature. Present work includes finite element approach to study the results of failure of bolted joint of <b>Coiler</b> <b>Drum.</b> A three-dimensional finite element model of a bolted joint has been developed using Pro-E wildfire 4. 0 and analysis has been done in ANSYS 11 commercial package. Modeling of Flange joint is done and then Structural and transient thermal analysis has been performed. Results obtained after analysis was then articulated which show good agreement. Finally, critical areas were identified and confirmed with the stress distribution results from simulation. The FEA outputs, such as stress and strain (Deformation), can be used with failure criteria to predict failure...|$|E
