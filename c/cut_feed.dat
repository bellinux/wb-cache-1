40|$|Cutting fluid {{plays an}} {{important}} role in machining processes to achieve dimensional accuracy in reducing tool wear and improving the tool life. Conventional flood cooling method in machining processes is not cost effective and consumption of huge amount of cutting fluids is not healthy and environmental friendly. In micromachining, flood cooling is not recommended to avoid possible damage of the microstructures. Therefore, one of the alternatives to overcome the environmental issues to use minimum quantity of lubrication (MQL) in machining process. MQL is eco-friendly and has economical advantage on manufacturing cost. However, there observed lack of study on MQL in improving machined surface roughness in micromilling. Study of the effects of MQL on surface roughness should be carried out because surface roughness is one of the important issues in micromachined parts such as microfluidic channels. This paper investigates and compares surface roughness with the presence of MQL and dry cutting in micromilling of aluminium alloy 1100 using DT- 110 milling machine. The relationship among depth of <b>cut,</b> <b>feed</b> rate, and spindle speed on surface roughness is also analyzed. All three machining parameters identified as significant for surface roughness with dry cutting which are depth of <b>cut,</b> <b>feed</b> rate, and spindle speed.

The dental cutting was performed using a computer-controlled 2 -degrees-of-freedom (2 -DOF) testing regime and a coarse diamond bur of 106 – 125 μm grit size. Dynamic forces were monitored during the cutting process using a piezoelectric force dynamometer and a data acquisition system in both time and frequency domains. Bur speeds were found to decrease with the depth of cut and with the feed rate, by a maximum of 10. 5 % from the free-running speed of 322. 2 krpm (1 krpm = 1000 rpm) to 288. 4 krpm at the highest feed rate of 60 mm/min and depth of cut of 50 μm.
