The play {{was inspired by}} his daughter Nancy, with whom he was reunited in 1946. It {{was first published in}} the Harvard College magazine the Wake. The play's main characters are Santa Claus, his family (Woman and <b>Child),</b> <b>Death,</b> and Mob. At the outset of the play, Santa Claus's family has disintegrated due to their lust for knowledge (Science). After a series of events, however, Santa Claus's faith in love and his rejection of the materialism and disappointment he associates with Science are reaffirmed, and he is reunited with Woman and Child.|$|E

The study aims to investigate <b>child</b> <b>deaths</b> associated with violence or neglect. Cases of suspected <b>child</b> <b>deaths</b> from 2000 to 2007 in the Suez Canal area were retrospectively reviewed. Cases were collected from the database of the Forensic Institution of Port-Said. A medico-legal autopsy had been carried out for all cases. Of the 89 cases, 56 were males and 33 were females. Resultsrevealed that <b>child</b> <b>deaths</b> were 41. 6 % in newborns less than one month old, 29. 2 % in the age group between 15 and 18 years old, and 5. 6 % in the age group between 10 and 14 years old. The majority of perpetrators were unknown (44. 95 %), followed by victim’s colleagues and neighbors (22. 47 %). Neglect with no outward signs represented the majority of <b>child</b> <b>deaths</b> (41. 57 %). Blunt trauma used in an abusive manner during street arguments was the second cause of homicidal deaths (19. 1 %). The highest rate of <b>child</b> <b>deaths</b> was in newborns and early youth. There is need for further examination of child fatality profiles associated with abuse and neglect {{in this age group}} and an increase in community outreach efforts to prevent fatal child abuse in Egypt...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In 2006 the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Perinatal Deaths was {{extended}} to pilot a collection of <b>child</b> <b>deaths.</b> This helped optimise data collection for local safeguarding children's boards, which, since April 2008, have a statutory responsibility to review all <b>child</b> <b>deaths.</b> Reviewing primary care records may highlight areas in which systems, skills, and care could be improved. AIM: To review the role and quality of primary care in <b>child</b> <b>deaths.</b> DESIGN OF STUDY: Confidential enquiry into <b>child</b> <b>deaths.</b> SETTING: Five regions of the UK: North-East, South-West and West Midlands, Wales, and Northern Ireland. METHOD: The confidential enquiry collected core data for all <b>child</b> <b>deaths</b> (age range 28 days to 17 years) and an age-stratified sample was assessed by multidisciplinary panels for avoidable factors. An independent detailed review was conducted of the primary care records on all children in the North-East region and all children who were reviewed by panel in the other four regions. RESULTS: Primary care records were reviewed for 168 <b>child</b> <b>deaths.</b> There were 25 (15 %) deaths from acute infection, 22 (13 %) from cancer, and 11 (7 %) from asthma or epilepsy. Fifty-nine (35 %) deaths were sudden: sudden unexplained death in infancy, suicides, and assaults. Of 149 with immunisation records, only 88 (59 %) had been fully vaccinated on time. One or more primary care professionals {{were involved in the}} management of 90 (54 %) children. Avoidable primary care factors were identified in 18 (20 %) of these deaths. Avoidable primary care factors included failure in the recognition and management of serious infection, failure to vaccinate, and inadequate management of asthma and epilepsy. CONCLUSION: Decisions made about diagnosis and management in primary care may affect the cause, time, and circumstances of a <b>child's</b> <b>death.</b> Maintaining skills in assessing the acutely ill child remains an essential part of good clinical practice...|$|R
