500|$|An {{alternative}} to the fathometer was devised involving {{the use of the}} ship's active forward search sonar in conjunction with the gravity meter installed in the <b>combat</b> <b>intelligence</b> center (CIC). By using both systems in tandem, underwater masses could be detected and avoided, although this approach lacked the capability of the fathometer to echo-sound the depth of the ocean floor. [...] On 13 March, Triton detected a submerged peak using active sonar and the gravity meter that confirmed the feasibility of this procedure.|$|E

500|$|Radford {{was noted}} for {{thinking}} progressively and innovatively {{to establish the}} most effective and efficient training programs.

Radford also suggested integrating women into intricate but repetitive tasks, such as running flight simulators. When commanders rejected the idea of bringing women into the service, he convinced Congressman Carl Vinson, chair of the House Naval Affairs Committee of the merit of the idea. This effort eventually led to the employment of the [...] "Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service", and 23,000 WAVES would assist in aeronautical training {{in the course of the}} war. Radford also sought to best use the assets of businessmen and professionals who had volunteered for military service, establishing the Aviation Indoctrination School and Air <b>Combat</b> <b>Intelligence</b> School at Naval Air Station Quonset Point so as to enable these advanced recruits to become more experienced naval officers.|$|E
