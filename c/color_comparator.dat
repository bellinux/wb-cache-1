5000|$|The {{method was}} {{developed}} by Fran√ßois-Alphonse Forel and was three years later extended with greenish brown to cola brown colors by the German limnologist Willi Ule. The Forel Ule scale, a <b>color</b> <b>comparator</b> scale, {{has been described by}} Wernand and van der Woerd (M. R. Wernand, H. J. van der Woerd, [...] "Spectral analysis of the Forel-Ule Ocean colour comparator scale.", J. Europ. Opt. Soc. Rap. Public. 10014s Vol 5 (2010), [...] ) and {{can be seen as a}} simple but adequate scale to classify the color of rivers, lakes, seas and oceans. The Forel-Ule observations belong, besides temperature, salinity and Secchi depth, to the oldest oceanographic parameters dating back to 1890.|$|E
40|$|The indigo-carmine {{method is}} a simple, rapid, {{accurate}} colorimetric procedure for determining {{small amounts of}} dissolved oxygen in water (0 to 50 ppm). A solution of reduced indigo-carmine dye added to a water sample is oxidized {{by the presence of}} any dissolved oxygen and changes color. The change in color of the dye is directly proportional to the amount of dissolved oxygen present in the sample and can be determined by using a Johnson <b>color</b> <b>comparator.</b> (W. L.

40|$|The {{collection}} and archiving {{of data from}} personnel dosimeters has become increasingly important {{in light of the}} lowered threshold limit values (TLV) for hydrazine (HZ), monomethylhydrazine (MMH), and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH). The American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) lowered the TLV from 100 parts per billion (ppb) to 10 ppb and has caused increased concern over long term exposures of personnel to trace levels of these hypergols and other potentially harmful chemicals. An automated system of reading the exposure levels of personnel dosimeters and storing exposure data for subsequent evaluation has been developed. The reading of personnel dosimeter badges for exposure lo potentially harmful vapor concentrations of hydrazines or other chemicals is performed visually by comparing the color developed by the badge with a calibrated <b>color</b> <b>comparator.</b> The result obtained using visual comparisons of the developed badge color with the comparator may vary widely from user to user. The automated badge reader takes the variability out of the dosimeter reading by accurately comparing the reflectance obtained from a colored spot on the badge with a reading on the same spot prior to any exposure to chemical vapors. The observed difference between the reflectance values is used as part of a calculation of the dose value for the badge based on a stored calibration curve. The badge reader also stores bar-code data unique to each badge, as well as bar-code information on the user, as part of the permanent badge record. The start and stop exposure times for each badge are recorded and can be used as part of the calculated concentration, in ppm, for each badge logged during a recording period. The badge reader is equipped with a number of badge holders, each of which is unique to a specific type of personnel dosimeter badge. This gives the reader maximum flexibility to allow for the reading of several different types of badges. Test results of the badge reader for several different types of personnel dosimeter badges are presented within the body of this paper...|$|E
