40|$|Long-term {{infusion}} of prostacyclin, or its analogs, {{is an effective}} treatment for severe pulmonary arterial hypertension. However, dose escalation is often required to maintain efficacy. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the mechanisms of prostacyclin receptor desensitization using the prostacyclin analog <b>cicaprost</b> in rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Desensitization of the cAMP response occurred in 63 nM <b>cicaprost</b> after a 6 -h preincubation with agonist. This desensitization was reversed 12 h after agonist removal, and resensitization was inhibited by 10 μg/ml of cycloheximide. Desensitization was heterologous since desensitization to other Gsα-adenylyl cyclase (AC) -coupled agonists, isoproterenol (1 μM), adrenomedullin (100 nM), or bradykinin (1 μM), was also reduced by preincubation with <b>cicaprost.</b> The reduced cAMP response to prolonged <b>cicaprost</b> exposure appeared to be due to inhibition of AC activity since the responses to the directly acting AC agonist forskolin (3 μM) and the selective AC 5 activator NKH- 477 were similarly reduced. Expression of AC 2 and AC 5 / 6 protein levels transiently decreased after 1 h of <b>cicaprost</b> exposure. The PKA inhibitor H- 89 (1 μM) added 1 h before <b>cicaprost</b> preincubation (6 h, 63 nM) completely reversed cicaprost-induced desensitization, whereas the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (100 nM) was only partly effective. Desensitization was not prevented by the Gi inhibitor pertussis toxin. In conclusion, chronic treatment of PASMCs with <b>cicaprost</b> induced heterologous, reversible desensitization by inhibition of AC activity. Our data suggest that heterologous Gsα desensitization by <b>cicaprost</b> is mediated predominantly by a PKA-inhibitable isoform of AC, most likely AC 5 / 6...|$|E

In this pilot study, we investigated the clinical efficacy of and patient tolerance to two dosage levels of <b>cicaprost</b> (2. 5 μg tds and 5 μg tds) in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis (SSc). This was a three centre, double-blind, placebo controlled study of 49 patients carried out over four winter months. For a period of 10 days, 16 patients were given a placebo, 16 received <b>cicaprost</b> 2. 5 μg tds and 17 received <b>cicaprost</b> 5 μg tds. Response was assessed based on the total number and duration of Raynaud's attacks, the average severity of the attacks, the number of painful attacks as a proportion of all attacks, a digital ulcer count, and the patients' opinion of the treatment. Although the clinical and laboratory parameters of digital vasospasm did not show statistically significant improvement in those who received <b>cicaprost</b> compared with those on the placebo, the severity of attacks lessened in the patients who received <b>cicaprost</b> 5 μg tds, and a statistically significant difference was seen in the average severity at week 2 post-treatment (p= 0. 02). The apparent lack of overall significance was probably related to the short treatment period and relatively low doses of <b>cicaprost</b> used in this exploratory study.

40|$|Drug-eluting stents {{have been}} {{successful}} in reducing in-stent restenosis but are not suitable for all lesion types and have been implicated in causing late stent thrombosis due to incomplete regeneration of the endothelial cell layer. In this study we implanted stents coated with <b>cicaprost,</b> a prostacyclin analogue with a long plasma half-life and antiproliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells, into the iliac arteries of rabbits. At 28 day follow-up we compared neointima formation within the stented vessels and vascular function in adjacent vessels, to assess if <b>cicaprost</b> could reduce restenosis without impairing vessel function. Arteries implanted with <b>cicaprost</b> eluting stents had significantly more neointima compared to bare metal stents. In adjacent segments of artery, endothelium-dependent relaxation was impaired by the cicaprost-eluting stent but vasodilation to an endothelium-independent vasodilator was maintained. We conclude that the presence of the polymer and sub-optimal release of <b>cicaprost</b> from the stent may be responsible for the increased neointma and impaired functional recovery of the endothelium observed. Further experiments should be aimed at optimising release of <b>cicaprost</b> and exploring different stent polymer coatings...|$|E

Unlike iloprost, the stable prostacyclin analogue <b>cicaprost</b> (ZK 96480), is devoid of agonistic properties at prostaglandin E 2 receptors. We compared {{the effects of}} <b>cicaprost,</b> iloprost and PGE 2 on [Ca 2 +]i in HEL cells. <b>Cicaprost,</b> iloprost and PGE 2 were similarly potent to increase [Ca 2 +]i in HEL cells. However, unlike the effects of PGE 2, those of the prostacyclin analogues were not inhibited by pertussis toxin. The prostaglandins studied increased [Ca 2 +]i through both mobilization from internal stores and Ca 2 + influx from the extracellular space. Prostacyclin analogue- and PGE 2 -induced rises in [Ca 2 +]i were desensitized in a homologous manner. Additionally, there was cross-desensitization between <b>cicaprost</b> and iloprost, but not between the prostacyclin analogues and PGE 2.

40|$|Atherosclerosis and {{restenosis}} are proliferative vascular diseases involving, in part, deregulated vascular {{smooth muscle}} cell proliferation. The dysfunction of endothelial cells plays {{a critical role}} in the early pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and the decreased production of prostacyclin in response to endothelial dysfunction, could contribute to the abnormal proliferation of smooth muscle cells during atherosclerosis. While it is known that prostacyclin inhibits aortic smooth muscle cell proliferation by blocking cell cycle progression from G 1 -phase to S-phase, the mechanism of this inhibition is poorly understood. ^ My main hypothesis was that prostacyclin negatively regulates smooth muscle cell proliferation by targeting specific G 1 phase cell cycle events, upstream of pRb phosphorylation. Using the stable prostacyclin analog, <b>cicaprost,</b> I found that prostacyclin inhibits the induction of cyclin A, a key marker of S phase entry, in both aortic smooth muscle cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts. The inhibition of cyclin A gene expression is associated with a block in cyclin E-cdk 2 activity and phosphorylation of both the retinoblastoma protein and p 107. Treatment of aortic smooth muscle cells with pertussis toxin reversed the inhibitory effects of <b>cicaprost</b> on cyclin E-cdk 2 activity and S phase entry, suggesting the involvement of Gi signaling in prostacyclin action. ^ Furthermore, I found that prostacyclin specifically inhibits cyclin E-cdk 2 activity through the selective regulation of p 27 Kip 1. First, I showed that <b>cicaprost</b> prevents the late G 1 phase downregulation of p 27 Kip 1 and that the inhibitory effect of <b>cicaprost</b> on cyclin E-cdk 2 activity and S phase entry is eliminated by deleting p 27 Kip 1. Levels of the closely related cdk 2 inhibitor, p 21 Cip 1, are unaffected by <b>cicaprost.</b> Moreover, I showed that <b>cicaprost</b> blocks the induction of Skp 2 mRNA and that ectopic expression of a Skp 2 cDNA overrides the effect of <b>cicaprost</b> on p 27 Kip 1 levels and S phase entry. My studies demonstrate, for the first time, the effect of a potent antimitogen on F-box gene expression and have potential implications for cardiovascular disease. ...|$|E
40|$|Our {{study shows}} that the {{prostacyclin}} analogues AFP- 07 and <b>cicaprost</b> are moderately potent agonists for prostanoid EP 4 receptors, {{in addition to being}} highly potent IP 1 receptor agonists. Both activities were demonstrated on piglet and rabbit saphenous veins, which are established EP 4 preparations. On piglet saphenous vein, PGE 2 was 6. 1, 24, 96, 138, 168 and 285 times respectively more potent than AFP- 07, <b>cicaprost,</b> PGI 2, iloprost, carbacyclin and TEI- 9063 in causing relaxation. Another prostacyclin analogue taprostene did not induce maximum relaxation (21 – 74 %), and did not oppose the action of PGE 2. The EP 4 receptor antagonist AH 23848 (30 μm) blocked relaxant responses to PGE 2 (dose ratio= 8. 6 ± 1. 3, s. e. mean) {{to a greater extent than}} <b>cicaprost</b> (4. 9 ± 0. 7) and AFP- 07 (3. 8 ± 0. 8), had variable effects on TEI- 9063 -induced relaxation (3. 7 ± 1. 5), and had no effect on taprostene responses (< 2. 0). On rabbit saphenous vein, AH 23848 blocked the relaxant actions of PGE 2, AFP- 07, <b>cicaprost,</b> iloprost and carbacyclin to similar extents. AFP- 07, <b>cicaprost</b> and TEI- 9063 showed high IP 1 relaxant potency on piglet carotid artery, rabbit mesenteric artery and guinea-pig aorta, with AFP- 07 confirmed as the most potent IP 1 agonist reported to date. AH 23848 did not block cicaprost-induced relaxation of piglet carotid artery. EP 3 contractile systems in these preparations can confound IP 1 agonist potency estimations.

In the present study we compared PGE 2 with prostacyclin (PGI 2) analogs in their potency to influence LPS-stimulated production of interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) and TNF-alpha by human mononuclear cells (MNC). Our results show, that the stable analogs of PGI 2, iloprost and <b>cicaprost,</b> markedly suppress TNF-alpha synthesis in LPS-stimulated MNC without effect on IL- 1 beta production. Although {{there was no significant}} difference in maximal suppression of TNF-alpha, iloprost and <b>cicaprost</b> reached suppression to 50 % of control at 20 -fold lower concentrations than PGE 2. The ID 50 for iloprost and <b>cicaprost</b> were 8 nM and 5 nM, respectively, compared to 125 nM for PGE 2. Moreover, the prostacyclin analogs as well as PGE 2 suppressed LPS-induced production of TNF-alpha in Mono Mac 6 cells, a permanent human cell line with characteristics of mature monocytes. Suppression of TNF-alpha synthesis by <b>cicaprost</b> and PGE 2 is probably mediated by an increased intracellular cAMP formation. We were able to show elevated cAMP levels with 1 microM and 10 microM of PGE 2 and <b>cicaprost</b> in this system. The suppression of TNF-alpha synthesis may add to the beneficial effects of iloprost reported in animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and may offer a therapeutic approach in TNF-alpha mediated pathologic processes...|$|E

The high potency of <b>cicaprost</b> (EC 150 = 1. 3 [*]nM) {{and the relative}} potencies of the analogues (equi-effective molar ratios= 1. 0, 0. 85, 1. 6, 17 and 82, respectively) suggest the involvement of a prostacyclin (IP-) receptor. Maximum enhancement induced by <b>cicaprost</b> in 2. 5 [*]mM K+ Krebs-Henseleit solution {{was similar to that}} in Tyrode solution (2. 7 [*]mM K+), but was progressively reduced as the K+ concentration was increased to 3. 9, 5. 9 and 11. 9 [*]mM. There was also a greater tendency for the other prostacyclin analogues to inhibit EFS responses in 5. 9 [*]mM standard K+ Krebs-Henseleit solution; this may be attributed to their agonist actions on presynaptic EP 3 -receptors resulting in inhibition of transmitter release. The EFS enhancing action of <b>cicaprost</b> was not affected by the α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (100 and 1000 [*]nM). <b>Cicaprost</b> (20 and 200 [*]nM) did not affect contractile responses of the vas deferens to either ATP (5 [*]μM) or α,β-methylene ATP (1 [*]μM) in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 100 [*]nM). In addition, enhancement by <b>cicaprost</b> of responses to higher concentrations of ATP (30 and 300 [*]μM) in the absence of TTX, as shown previously by others, was not seen. Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2, 10 [*]nM) and another prostacyclin analogue TEI- 3356 (20 [*]nM) enhanced purinoceptor agonist responses. Unexpectedly, TTX (0. 1 and 1 [*]μM) partially inhibited contractions elicited by 10 – 1000 [*]μM ATP; contractions elicited by 1 – 3 [*]μM ATP were unaffected. Further studies are required to establish whether a pre- or post-synaptic mechanism is involved. In a separate series of experiments, <b>cicaprost</b> (5 – 250 [*]nM), TEI- 9063 (3 – 300 [*]nM), 4 -aminopyridine (10 – 100 [*]μM) and tetraethylammonium (100 – 1000 [*]μM) enhanced both 20 %-EFS responses and the accompanying overflow of noradrenaline to a similar extent. In further experiments with the EP 1 -receptor antagonist AH 6809, TEI- 3356 (1. 0 – 100 [*]nM) and the EP 3 -receptor agonist, sulprostone (0. 1 – 1. 0 [*]nM) inhibited both maximal EFS responses and noradrenaline overflow, thus confirming previous reports of the high activity of TEI- 3356 at the EP 3 -receptor. <b>Cicaprost</b> had no significant effect on noradrenaline overflow at 10 and 100 [*]nM, but produced a modest inhibition at 640 [*]nM. In conclusion, our studies show that prostacyclin analogues (particularly TEI- 3356) can inhibit EFS responses of the guinea-pig vas deferens by acting as agonists at presynaptic EP 3 -receptors. Prostacyclin analogues (particularly <b>cicaprost</b> and TEI- 9063) can also enhance EFS responses through activation of IP-receptors.

40|$|AbstractThe {{group of}} {{prostaglandin}} (PG) E 2 - and prostacyclin receptors consists of different subtypes, which exibit different affinities for prostaglandins and synthetic analogues. PGE 2 activates the E-type PG receptor subtypes EP 1, EP 2 and EP 3, whereas the PGE 2 analogue, sulprostone, binds {{only to the}} EP 1 and EP 3 receptor subtypes. The stable PGI 2 analogues, iloprost and <b>cicaprost,</b> both activate the PGI 2 receptor (IP) and iloprost, additionally, bind to the EP 1 subtype. Using these subtype-selective PG receptor agonists, we studied the interaction of PG receptor subtypes with Gs and Gi-type heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) in membranes from the human erythroleukaemia cell line, HEL. Sulprostone stimulated high-affinity GTPase in HEL membranes in a pertussis toxin (PTX) -sensitive manner. In contrast, the stimulations induced by PGE 2, iloprost and <b>cicaprost</b> were only partially inhibited by PTX. PGE 2, sulprostone, iloprost and <b>cicaprost</b> stimulated cholera toxin-catalysed ADP-ribosylation as well as labelling with GTP azidoanilide of membrane proteins comigrating with immunologically identified Gi protein α subunits. Furthermore, PGE 2, iloprost and <b>cicaprost</b> enhanced GTP azidoanilide-labelling of Gs protein α subunits, whereas sulprostone did not.

40|$|The {{spontaneous}} {{activity of the}} rat isolated colon is suppressed by prostacyclin analogues such as <b>cicaprost</b> (IC 50 = 4. 0 [*]nM). Activation of prostanoid IP 1 -receptors located on NANC inhibitory neurones is involved. However, several non-prostanoids, which show medium to high IP 1 agonist potency on platelet and vascular preparations, exhibit very weak inhibitory activity on the colon. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate this discrepancy. Firstly, we have demonstrated the very high depolarizing potency of <b>cicaprost</b> on the rat isolated vagus nerve (EC 50 = 0. 23 [*]nM). Iloprost, taprostene and carbacyclin were 7. 9, 66, and 81 fold less potent than <b>cicaprost,</b> indicating the presence of IP 1 as opposed to IP 2 -receptors. Three non-prostanoid prostacyclin mimetics, BMY 45778, BMY 42393 and ONO- 1301, although much less potent than <b>cicaprost</b> (195, 990 and 1660 fold respectively), behaved as full agonists on the vagus nerve. On re-investigating the rat colon, we found that BMY 45778 (0. 1 – 3 [*]μM), BMY 42393 (3 [*]μM) and ONO- 1301 (3 [*]μM) behaved as specific IP 1 partial agonists, but their actions required 30 – 60 [*]min to reach steady-state and only slowly reversed on washing. This profile contrasted sharply with the rapid and readily reversible contractions elicited by a related non-prostanoid ONO-AP- 324, which is an EP 3 -receptor agonist. The full versus partial agonism of the non-prostanoid prostacyclin mimetics may be explained by the markedly different IP 1 agonist sensitivities of the two rat neuronal preparations. However, the slow kinetics of the non-prostanoids on the NANC system of the colon remain unexplained, and must be taken into account when characterizing neuronal IP-receptors...|$|E

In contrast, taprostene interacted additively with prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), ONO-AE 1 - 259 (selective EP 2 agonist), and acetylcholine. Similarly, on rat tail artery contracted with phenylephrine, 3 microM taprostene (20 % relaxation) opposed AFP- 07 - but not PGE 2 -induced relaxation. However, under U- 46619 -induced tone (AH 23848 absent), taprostene antagonized AFP- 07 and <b>cicaprost</b> more than TEI- 9063, suggesting that the latter has more than one relaxation mechanism. The presence of a sensitive EP 3 contractile system in mouse aorta interfered with IP receptor-mediated relaxation. By generating tone with phenylephrine and the potent EP 3 agonist sulprostone, it was possible to show that 3 microM taprostene (15 % relaxation) selectively opposed relaxations induced by AFP- 07, TEI- 9063, and <b>cicaprost.</b> Our experiments indicate that taprostene is a partial agonist at prostanoid IP receptors, and may be a lead to an IP receptor antagonist...|$|E

OBJECTIVES: To {{determine the effect of}} PGI 2 on mouse and human ILC 2 cytokine expression in vitro and the effect of endogenous PGI 2 and the PGI 2 analog <b>cicaprost</b> on lung ILC 2 s in vivo. METHODS: Flow-sorted bone marrow ILC 2 s of wild-type (WT) and PGI 2 receptor-deficient (IP(-/-)) mice were cultured with IL- 33 and treated with the PGI 2 analog <b>cicaprost.</b> WT and IP(-/-) mice were challenged intranasally with Alternaria alternata extract for 4 consecutive days to induce ILC 2 responses, and these were quantified. Prior to A. alternata extract, challenged WT mice were treated with <b>cicaprost.</b> Human flow-sorted peripheral blood ILC 2 s were cultured with IL- 33 and IL- 2 and treated with the PGI 2 analog <b>cicaprost.</b> MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: We demonstrate that PGI 2 inhibits IL- 5 and IL- 13 protein expression by IL- 33 -stimulated ILC 2 s purified from mouse bone marrow in a manner that was dependent on signaling through the PGI 2 receptor IP. In a mouse model of 4 consecutive days of airway challenge with an extract of A. alternata, a fungal aeroallergen associated with severe asthma exacerbations, endogenous PGI 2 signaling significantly inhibited lung IL- 5 and IL- 13 protein expression, and reduced the number of lung IL- 5 - and IL- 13 -expressing ILC 2 s, as well as the mean fluorescence intensity of IL- 5 and IL- 13 staining. In addition, exogenous administration of a PGI 2 analog inhibited Alternaria extract-induced lung IL- 5 and IL- 13 protein expression, and reduced the number of lung IL- 5 - and IL- 13 -expressing ILC 2 s and the mean fluorescence intensity of IL- 5 and IL- 13 staining. Finally, a PGI 2 analog inhibited IL- 5 and IL- 13 expression by human ILC 2 s that were stimulated with IL- 2 and IL- 33.

A classical organ bath approach was used to examine the functional response of the rabbit iliac artery to the prostacyclin analogues, AFP- 07 and <b>cicaprost.</b> Selective receptor antagonists for prostanoid IP (RO- 1138452), EP 1 (SC- 51322) and EP 3 (L- 798106) receptors were used to characterise the receptors involved. The effects of these agents on proliferation ([3 H]-thymidine incorporation) of rabbit iliac artery smooth muscle cells stimulated by foetal calf serum were then studied. AFP- 07 gave a bell-shaped log concentration-response curve consisting of prostanoid IP receptor mediated relaxation followed by reversal at higher concentrations. SC- 51322 and L- 798106 potentiated this relaxation, although only L- 798106 completely removed the contractile element. The prostanoid EP 3 receptor agonist, sulprostone, produced constriction, which was attenuated by L- 798106.

In DRG cultures, <b>cicaprost</b> induced significantly more accumulation of inositol phosphates than PGE 2. To {{examine the effects of}} prostanoids on C-fibre activity, extracellular recordings of d. c. potentials from the rat isolated vagus nerve were made with the ‘grease-gap' technique. PGI 2 (0. 1 [*]nM– 10 [*]μM) produced the largest depolarizations of the nerve. The rank order of agonist potency was: PGI 2 =cPGI 2 =PGE 1 >cTXA 2 >PGE 2 =PGD 2 =TXB 2 >PGF 2 α. Prior depolarization of nerves with either forskolin (10 [*]μM) or phorbol dibutyrate (1 [*]μM) alone significantly reduced the response to PGI 2 (10 [*]μM), while simultaneous application of both forskolin and phorbol dibutyrate attenuated PGI 2 responses almost completely. Putative EP 1 and/or TP receptor-selective antagonists had no effect on the responses to PGI 2, cPGI 2 or PGE 2 in the three preparations studied. Collectively, these data are consistent with a positive coupling of IP receptors to both adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C in sensory neurones. These findings suggest that IP receptors {{play a major role in}} the sensitization of rat sensory neurones...|$|E

Herein {{the involvement of}} Rab 5 in regulating cicaprost-induced internalization of the hIP expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells was investigated. Over-expression of Rab 5 a significantly increased agonist-induced hIP internalization. Additionally, the hIP co-localized to Rab 5 a-containing endocytic vesicles in response to <b>cicaprost</b> stimulation {{and there was a}} coincident net translocation of Rab 5 from the cytosol/soluble fraction of the cell. Co-immunoprecipitation studies confirmed a direct physical interaction between the hIP and Rab 5 a that was augmented by <b>cicaprost.</b> Whilst the dominant negative Rab 5 aS 34 N did not show decreased interaction with the hIP or fully impair internalization, it prevented hIP sorting to endocytic vesicles. Moreover, the GTPase deficient Rab 5 aQ 79 L significantly increased internalization and co-localized with the hIP in enlarged endocytic vesicles. While deletion of the carboxyl terminal (C) -tail domain of the hIP did not inhibit agonist-induced internalization, co-localization or co-immunoprecipitation with Rab 5 a per se, receptor trafficking was altered suggesting that it contains structural determinant(s) for hIP sorting post Rab 5 -mediated endocytosis.

Herein the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) scaven-ger receptor class B, type 1 (SR-B 1) adapter protein PDZ domain-containing protein 1 (PDZK 1) was identified as an interactant {{of the human}} prostacyclin receptor (hIP) involving a Class I PDZ ligand at its carboxyl terminus and PDZ domains 1, 3, and 4 of PDZK 1. Although the interaction is constitutive, it may be dynamically regulated following <b>cicaprost</b> activation of the hIP through a mechanism involving cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PK) A-phosphoryla-tion of PDZK 1 at Ser- 505. Although PDZK 1 did not increase overall levels of the hIP, it in-creased its functional expression at the cell surface, enhancing ligand binding and cicaprost-induced cAMP generation. Consistent with its role in re-endothelialization and angiogenesis, <b>cicaprost</b> activation of the hIP increased endothelial cell migration and tube formation/in vitro angiogenesis, effects completely abrogated by the specific IP antagonist RO 1138452. Furthermore, similar to HDL/SR-B 1, small interfering RNA (siRNA) -targeted disruption of PDZK 1 abolished cicaprost-mediated endothelial responses but did not affect VEGF respons-es.

IP receptor agonists, <b>cicaprost</b> and iloprost, stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity with EC 50 values of 22 and 28 [*]nM, respectively. Prostaglandin E 1 (PGE 1) and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) were 7 fold less potent than <b>cicaprost</b> and iloprost, with PGE 2 displaying a lower maximal response. Adenylyl cyclase activation by iloprost, PGE 1 and PGE 2, but not by forskolin, was highly dependent on DRG cell density. Although the potency of iloprost and PGE 2 for stimulating adenylyl cyclase was unchanged, their maximal responses were significantly increased at low cell density. Both IP and EP 2 / 4 receptors could be down-regulated by agonist pretreatment, however the presence of cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors did not prevent this apparent down-regulation of IP and EP 2 / 4 receptors at high DRG cell densities. Stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide was also decreased at high DRG cell density, whereas the responses to β-adrenoceptor agonists were increased at high DRG cell density. Addition of nerve growth factor (NGF), or the addition of anti-neurotrophin antibodies during the 5 -day culture of DRG cells, {{had no effect on}} IP receptor-mediated responses.

Thus combined prostanoids and PDE inhibitors enhanced cAMP accumulation. TNF-alpha suppression in the presence of pentoxifylline and prostanoids exceeded that of either drug alone. The potency of different PDE inhibitors (theophylline, pentoxifylline, penthydroxifylline, albifylline, torbafylline, A 80 2715, amrinone and rolipram) to increase cAMP levels in combination with <b>cicaprost</b> was evaluated after 1 h of incubation. The dose-dependent increase of cAMP for all PDE inhibitors tested in this combined stimulation provided a useful tool for evaluating the potency of PDE inhibitors on cAMP accumulation. The effective concentration of PDE inhibitors, which raised cAMP levels to 300 % of control, (EC 300), correlated with the IC 50 for TNF-alpha suppression (r = 0. 930, p = 0. 007, with theophylline excluded from the analysis). Interestingly, by contrast, the specific type IV PDE inhibitor rolipram caused only a moderate rise of accumulated cAMP in the same cells. Our data support cAMP as an essential mediator for TNF-alpha suppression by PDE inhibitors. Furthermore, an enhanced inhibiting effect on TNF-alpha production may prove therapeutically advantageous.

40|$|The prostanoid receptor(s) that mediates {{inhibition}} of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα) generation from human peripheral blood monocytes was classified {{by use of}} naturally occurring and synthetic prostanoid agonists and antagonists. In human monocytes that were adherent to plastic, neither prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2), prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF 2 α) nor the stable prostacyclin and thromboxane mimetics, <b>cicaprost</b> and U- 46619, respectively, promoted the elaboration of TNFα-like immunoreactivity, as assessed with a specific ELISA, indicating the absence of excitatory prostanoid receptors on these cells. Exposure of human monocytes to LPS (3 [*]ng[*]ml− 1, ∼ EC 84) resulted in a time-dependent elaboration of TNFα which was suppressed in cells pretreated with prostaglandin E 1 (PGE 1), PGE 2 and <b>cicaprost.</b> This effect was concentration-dependent with mean pIC 50 values of 7. 14, 7. 34 and 8. 00 for PGE 1, PGE 2 and <b>cicaprost,</b> respectively. PGD 2, PGF 2 α and U- 46619 failed to inhibit the generation of TNFα at concentrations up to 10 [*]μM. With respect to PGE 2, the EP-receptor agonists, 16, 16 -dimethyl PGE 2 (non-selective), misoprostol (EP 2 /EP 3 -selective), 11 -deoxy PGE 1 (EP 2 -selective) and butaprost (EP 2 -selective) were essentially full agonists as inhibitors of LPS-induced TNFα generation with mean pIC 50 values of 6. 21, 6. 02, 5. 67 and 5. 59, respectively. In contrast to the results obtained with butaprost and 11 -deoxy PGE 1, another EP 2 -selective agonist, AH 13205, inhibited TNFα generation by only 21 % at the highest concentration (10 [*]μM) examined. EP-receptor agonists which have selectivity for the EP 1 - (17 -phenyl-ω-trinor PGE 2) and EP 3 -receptor (MB 28, 767, sulprostone) were inactive or only weakly active as inhibitors of TNFα generation. Pretreatment of human monocytes with the TP/EP 4 -receptor antagonist, AH 23848 B, at 10, 30 and 100 [*]μM suppressed LPS-induced TNFα generation by 10 %, 28 % and 77 %, respectively, but failed to shift significantly {{the location of the}} PGE 2 concentration-response curves. Given that AH 13205 was a poor inhibitor of TNFα generation, studies were performed to determine if it was a partial agonist and whether it could antagonize the inhibitory effect of PGE 2. Pretreatment of human monocytes with 10 and 30 [*]μM AH 13205 inhibited the generation of TNFα by 31 % and 53 %, respectively, but failed to shift significantly the location of the PGE 2 concentration-response curves at either concentration examined. Since PGD 2 and 17 -phenyl-ω-trinor PGE 2 (EP 1 -agonist) did not suppress TNFα generation, the EP 1 /EP 2 /DP-receptor antagonist, AH 6809, was employed to assess if EP 2 -receptors mediated the inhibitory effect of PGE 2. Pretreatment of human monocytes with 10 [*]μM AH 6809 did not affect LPS-induced TNFα generation but produced a parallel 3. 5 fold rightwards shift of the PGE 2 concentration-response curve. Collectively, these data suggest that human peripheral blood monocytes express at least two distinct populations of inhibitory prostanoid receptors that mediate {{inhibition of}} LPS-induced TNFα generation. One of these probably represents IP receptors based upon the selectivity of <b>cicaprost</b> for this subtype. The other population has the pharmacology of EP-receptors, but the rank order of potency for a range of synthetic EP-receptor agonists was inconsistent with an interaction with any of the currently defined subtypes.

The IP receptor agonists <b>cicaprost</b> and iloprost were both less potent than the DP agonists in inhibiting histamine release (45. 2 ± 3. 3 % and 35. 1 ± 2. 5 % inhibition respectively at 10 − 5 [*]M), whereas PGF 2 α and the TP receptor agonist U- 46619 were only marginally effective. The EP 4 /TP receptor antagonist AH 23848 failed to affect the inhibitory actions of PGD 2 or PGE 2 even at 10 − 5 [*]M, whereas the DP/EP 1 /EP 2 receptor antagonist AH 6809 slightly enhanced the effect of PGD 2 at 10 − 6 [*]M.

Proliferation of VSMCs was assessed by measuring [3 H]-thymidine incorporation and the cell number, and their hypertrophy by [14 C]-leucine incorporation and protein content. In VSMCs from wild-type mice, expressions of mRNAs for the EP 4 and TP were most abundant, followed by those for the IP, EP 3 and FP, when examined by competitive reverse transcriptase-PCR. Those for the EP 1, EP 2 and DP, however, could not be detected. AE 1 - 329, an EP 4 agonist, and <b>cicaprost,</b> an IP agonist, inhibited platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) -induced proliferation of VSMCs from wild-type mice; these inhibitory effects disappeared completely in VSMCs from EP 4 −/− and IP−/− mice, respectively.

Effects of PGE 2 on cell proliferation and adenylate cyclase were almost similar with those of AE 1 - 329 in VSMCs from wild-type mice, which disappeared in VSMCs from EP 4 −/− mice. PGD 2 inhibited PDGF-induced proliferation of VSMCs from both wild-type and DP−/− mice to a similar extent. This action of PGD 2 was also observed in VSMCs from EP 4 −/− and IP−/− mice.

40|$|Background:: Prostacyclin (PGI 2) {{is known}} to be an {{important}} mediator of peripheral pain sensation (nociception) whereas little is known about its role in central sensitization. Methods:: The levels of the stable PGI 2 -metabolite 6 -keto-prostaglandin F 1 α (6 -keto-PGF 1 α) and of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) were measured in the dorsal horn with the use of mass spectrometry after peripheral inflammation. Expression of the prostanoid receptors was determined by immunohistology. Effects of prostacyclin receptor (IP) activation on spinal neurons were investigated with biochemical assays (cyclic adenosine monophosphate-, glutamate release-measurement, Western blot analysis) in embryonic cultures and adult spinal cord. The specific IP antagonist Cay 10441 was applied intrathecally after zymosan-induced mechanical hyperalgesia in vivo. Results:: Peripheral inflammation caused a significant increase of the stable PGI 2 metabolite 6 -keto-PGF 1 α in the dorsal horn of wild-type mice (n = 5). IP was located on spinal neurons and did not colocalize with the prostaglandin E 2 receptors EP 2 or EP 4. The selective IP-agonist <b>cicaprost</b> increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate synthesis in spinal cultures from wild-type but not from IP-deficient mice (n = 5 – 10). The combination of fluorescence-resonance–energy transfer–based cyclic adenosine monophosphate imaging and calcium imaging showed a cicaprost-induced cyclic adenosine monophosphate synthesis in spinal cord neurons (n = 5 – 6). Fittingly, IP activation increased glutamate release from acute spinal cord sections of adult mice (n = 13 – 58). <b>Cicaprost,</b> but not agonists for EP 2 and EP 4, induced protein kinase A–dependent phosphorylation of the GluR 1 subunit and its translocation to the membrane. Accordingly, intrathecal administration of the IP receptor antagonist Cay 10441 had an antinociceptive effect (n = 8 – 11). Conclusion:: Spinal prostacyclin synthesis during early inflammation causes the recruitment of GluR 1 receptors to membrane fractions, thereby augmenting the onset of central sensitization. Peripheral inflammation increases spinal levels of PGI 2, which in turn stimulates cyclic adenosine monophosphate production and glutamate release. Correspondingly, spinal neuron IP receptor blockade causes analgesia. These results provide a framework for understanding PGI 2 participation in spinal nociceptive signaling...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension is a proliferative vascular disease, characterized by aberrant regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation and apoptosis in distal pulmonary arteries. Prostacyclin (PGI 2) analogues have anti-proliferative effects on distal human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), which {{are dependent on}} intracellular cAMP stimulation. We therefore sought to investigate {{the involvement of the}} main cAMP-specific enzymes, phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE 4), responsible for cAMP hydrolysis. Methods Distal human PASMCs were derived from pulmonary arteries by explant culture (n = 14, passage 3 – 12). Responses to platelet-derived growth factor-BB (5 – 10 ng/ml), serum, PGI 2 analogues (<b>cicaprost,</b> iloprost) and PDE 4 inhibitors (roflumilast, rolipram, cilomilast) were determined by measuring cAMP phosphodiesterase activity, intracellular cAMP levels, DNA synthesis, apoptosis (as measured by DNA fragmentation and nuclear condensation) and matrix metalloproteinase- 2 and - 9 (MMP- 2, MMP- 9) production. Results Expression of all four PDE 4 A-D genes was detected in PASMC isolates. PDE 4 contributed to the main proportion (35. 9 ± 2. 3 %, n = 5) of cAMP-specific hydrolytic activity demonstrated in PASMCs, compared to PDE 3 (21. 5 ± 2. 5 %), PDE 2 (15. 8 ± 3. 4 %) or PDE 1 activity (14. 5 ± 4. 2 %). Intracellular cAMP levels were increased by PGI 2 analogues and further elevated in cells co-treated with roflumilast, rolipram and cilomilast. DNA synthesis was attenuated by 1 μM roflumilast (49 ± 6 % inhibition), rolipram (37 ± 6 %) and cilomilast (30 ± 4 %) and, in the presence of 5 nM <b>cicaprost,</b> these compounds exhibited EC 50 values of 4. 4 (2. 6 – 6. 1) nM (Mean and 95 % confidence interval), 59 (36 – 83) nM and 97 (66 – 130) nM respectively. Roflumilast attenuated cell proliferation and gelatinase (MMP- 2 and MMP- 9) production and promoted the anti-proliferative effects of PGI 2 analogues. The cAMP activators iloprost and forskolin also induced apoptosis, whereas roflumilast had no significant effect. Conclusion PDE 4 enzymes are expressed in distal human PASMCs and the effects of cAMP-stimulating agents on DNA synthesis, proliferation and MMP production is dependent, at least in part, on PDE 4 activity. PDE 4 inhibition may provide greater control of cAMP-mediated anti-proliferative effects in human PASMCs and therefore could prove useful as an additional therapy for pulmonary {{arterial hypertension}}. </p...|$|E

The increases in [Ca 2 +]i induced by thrombin, PAF, ATP, UTP, iloprost and <b>cicaprost</b> were pertussis toxin-insensitive, whereas the increases induced by PGE 2 and sulprostone were completely inhibited by the toxin. The increase in [Ca 2 +]i induced by PGE 1 was partially inhibited by pertussis toxin. PGE 2 did not desensitize the increase in [Ca 2 +]i induced by iloprost, and vice versa. PGE 1 desensitized the response to PGE 2 and iloprost but not vice versa. Adrenaline potentiated the iloprost- but not the PGE 2 -induced rise in [Ca 2 +]i. The phorbol ester phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate completely blocked the rise in [Ca 2 +]i induced by ATP and PGE 1, whereas the increases induced by thrombin and PAF were only partially inhibited. Agonists increased [Ca 2 +]i through release from internal stores and sustained Ca 2 + influx. Thrombin stimulated Mn 2 + influx, which was blocked by Ni 2 +. Diltiazem, isradipine, gramicidin and 1 -(beta-[3 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) propoxy]- 4 -methoxyphenethyl) - 1 H-imidazole hydrochloride (SK&F 96365) did not affect agonist-induced rises in [Ca 2 +]i. HEL cells contained substantial amounts of beta-glucuronidase which, however, could not be released, and they did not aggregate or generate superoxide. Our data suggest that: (1) HEL cells possess nucleotide receptors with properties similar to those of phagocytes; (2) they possess receptors for PGE 2 and PGI 2, and PGE 1 is an agonist at both receptors; (3) agonist-induced increases in [Ca 2 +]i are mediated through pertussis toxin-sensitive as well as -insensitive signal transduction pathways; and (4) agonists increase [Ca 2 +]i by mobilization from internal stores and influx from the extracellular space through cation channels with properties similar to those of phagocytes and platelets...|$|E
