500|$|That summer, Prokofiev {{completed}} the Divertimento, Op. 43 (which {{he had started}} in 1925) and revised his Sinfonietta, Op. 5/48, a work started in his days at the Conservatory. In October that year, he had a car crash while driving his family back to Paris from their holiday: as the car turned over, Prokofiev pulled some muscles on his left hand. Prokofiev was therefore unable to perform in Moscow during his tour shortly after the accident, but {{he was able to}} enjoy watching performances of his music from the audience. Prokofiev also attended the Bolshoi Theatre's [...] "audition" [...] of his ballet Le pas d'acier, and was interrogated by members of the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM) about the work: he was asked whether the factory portrayed [...] "a capitalist factory, where the worker is a slave, or a Soviet factory, where the worker is the master? If it is a Soviet factory, when and where did Prokofiev examine it, since from 1918 to the present he has been living abroad and <b>came</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> the first time in 1927 for two weeks ?" [...] Prokofiev replied, [...] "That concerns politics, not music, and therefore I won't answer." [...] The RAPM condemned the ballet as a [...] "flat and vulgar anti-Soviet anecdote, a counter-revolutionary composition bordering on Fascism". The Bolshoi had no option but to reject the ballet.|$|E

It is the only park in East Africa with an Indian Ocean beachfront. It is Tanzania's 13th National Park. Animals are seen basking along the Indian Ocean shores. Before it was declared a national park it was maintained by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) with the objective to preserve the last coastal rainforest in the country. It was also run as a cattle ranch between 1952 and 2000. Hunting lodges had also been established on the coastal front of the park, which catered to the celebrities who <b>came</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> hunting game and {{to be away from}} the busy life in Dare es Salam.|$|E

2500|$|During the 10th {{anniversary of}} the Bessarabian union, Buzdugan showed himself optimistic about the {{prospects}} of the region, against Halippa and Ioncu, who shared a bleaker outlook. In November 1928, at another festive meeting of the former Sfatul deputies, he clashed with Stere, who demanded that a resolution be adopted in support of [...] "people's liberties", and against the [...] "exceptional laws". Buzdugan reproached Stere: [...] "So you <b>came</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> politicking." [...] In his new term in the Assembly after the 1928 election, he took a position against Bessarabian autonomism, describing it as a [...] "Russian formula" [...] and a [...] "worrisome" [...] threat. Buzdugan also questioned the PNȚ government over its alleged tolerance of communist and pro-Soviet activities in Bessarabia. Nevertheless, he endorsed decentralization of the lesser government bodies, [...] "for it won't do that someone should have to travel {{back and forth from}} Bessarabia to Bucharest".|$|E
2500|$|Not all BevMo! {{expansion}} {{has been}} welcomed by city residents. In March 2010 in Santa Barbara, California, a group voiced opposition at a city board meeting, delaying {{approval of a}} BevMo! store. Concerns brought up at the meeting included complaints about the company's plans to cut down a tree in the parking lot, and about loading dock plans that would increase congestion in a narrow alley. The city's Architectural Board of Review member Paul Zink recommended against BevMo!'s plans to have pedestrians cross a parking lot to enter the store, saying that [...] "there's a tie-in between what's inside and the street". Zink continued, [...] "here in Santa Barbara, we like to window shop." [...] Area retailers noted that a new liquor store within range of nine smaller liquor stores and several supermarkets that sell liquor would decrease sales for longstanding area businesses. Sarkis Abdulhi, a liquor store owner, asked, [...] "how can a politician say they support small business when they bring in giant chains? How many employees {{are they going to}} have, 13? What good does that do anybody when they put nine or 10 small shops out of business?" [...] Area resident Trudy Fernandez said the opening of chain location [...] "takes away from what people like me who have been in Santa Barbara 40 years <b>came</b> <b>here</b> <b>for.</b> This is a small town—we don't want to be L.A." [...] The store, BevMo's 105th, saw brisk business upon opening.|$|E
