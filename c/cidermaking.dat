50|$|By {{the early}} 19th century {{it was often}} {{said to be the}} most favoured variety for <b>cidermaking</b> even in England, {{but by the end of}} the century it had been supplanted by newer cultivars and was little known.

50|$|Jefferson {{stated the}} 'Taliaferro' apple was very juicy {{and good for}} eating. He praised it as the best cider apple he had tasted, {{producing}} a hard cider similar to wine or Champagne. In 1835, a gentleman named William Kenrick described the fruits as being small, only 1-2 inches in diameter, with white, red-streaked skin. Kenrick claimed the apples were unfit for eating, but reaffirmed their value in <b>cidermaking.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Staunton used {{to lie in}} {{the county}} of Worcestershire. Originally Staunton was {{included}} in the [...] "forest of Corse", the woodland in 1086 being a league long and half a league in breadth. In 1347 Robert de Staunton, then lord of the manor, obtained a grant of a Wednesday market at Staunton and a fair for four days at the feast of St James, but by the 17th century the earlier prosperity of Staunton had disappeared. At the end of the 18th century cider and perry were produced in large quantities at Staunton, but because the soil produced good crops of wheat, beans and barley, the <b>cidermaking</b> industry died out.|$|E
5000|$|Kingston Black {{is capable}} of making a {{distinctive}} single-variety cider, and its value in <b>cidermaking</b> meant that by the early 19th century it became more well known. By 1950 the Long Ashton Research Station {{referred to it as}} [...] "more widely grown than any other cider apple" [...] in the West of England. Despite this popularity, one former Long Ashton staff member wrote that many thought the variety's fame as a vintage quality apple was [...] "somewhat exaggerated", and Hogg quoted a Taunton nurseryman as stating that Kingston Black [...] "of itself makes a thin cider, but a few only communicate a high colour to other ciders".|$|E
50|$|However {{the last}} quarter of the 20th century proved this region had ample {{potential}} for revival: records of how cider was once made were left untouched. The equipment for creating its sweeter, non-alcoholic cousin could easily be switched for hard cider and many of the old presses were still usable. The wine revolution in California had taken off and often beaten European varietals in taste tests, an important step proving the United States could make quality alcohol other than whisky and opening the floodgates to better quality, more modern machinery and tools in greater volume: some of this equipment can also be used in <b>cidermaking,</b> and in New England thus it became possible to order it by catalogue, by asking for the surplus from California winemakers, and by the early 1990s, by internet. Heirloom varieties still survived in more remote areas of the region, sometimes hidden on abandoned farm land, and there was contact with other countries that produced alcohol derived from apples such as Canada and Ireland, the latter country exporting it for the Irish expat community in Boston and the large Irish American population in the Northeast.|$|E
50|$|Thus {{it was in}} {{this region}} that the {{earliest}} attempts for national revival of hard cider took place in the mid 1980s. By the early 1990s <b>cidermaking</b> was up and running {{to the point that the}} first cider festival took place, and as of August 2014 the region boasts more than 44 different cideries, with eighteen of them in Massachusetts alone. Notable in this region is the production of several different types of cider. Farmhouse cider generally designates a simple sweet alcoholic cider, while barrel aged ciders tend to be aged for a few years in red oak barrels creating a much sharper flavor. Typical production methods do not use the horse and masher system of France or Europe but often are partially mechanical. Ice cider is also a product of this region, relished by Canadian French speakers in the northern parts of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. These producers have learned it from their neighbors and relatives over the border, but now ship their product to twenty different states and with new producers in portions of Massachusetts and New York. Overall this region of the U.S gets much colder than Western Europe with temperatures getting well below 0 °C by the second week of December, but the conditions are ideal for natural freeze distillation. Experimental varietals using ingredients like ginger and spice are also bottled, as is a variety consistent with the original brewing method native to the region in which, after an initial fermentation, sugar and raisins is added to the brew and the liquid is again fermented, boosting the alcoholic content up to 13%.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of different <b>cidermaking</b> systems and apple mixtures on {{the dynamics of}} yeast populations in cider manufactured in Asturias (northern Spain) were studied. Results obtained in an experimental pilot plant were compared with those found in Asturian cider plants by using traditional techniques. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Kloeckera apiculata were found in all cases...|$|E
40|$|A {{capillary}} sieving electrophoretic {{method for}} protein analysis and molecular weight determination {{was used to}} characterize ciders from Asturias, northern Spain. The total protein content (Bradford method) and the foam parameters (Bikerman method) were also analyzed to complete this characterization. The polypeptide profile, based on the molecular weight, together with exploratory and classification techniques, that is, principal component analysis (PCA) or linear discriminant analysis (LDA), allowed ciders to be differentiated {{on the basis of}} their foam assessment and the apple juice extraction technology used in the <b>cidermaking</b> process. In addition, the application of correlation analysis, that is, canonical correlations (CCA) or partial least-squares (PLS), revealed that the proteins with higher molecular weight were more relevant with respect to cider foamability. PLS analysis also provided a mathematical equation that is able to predict the stabilization time of foam from the polypeptide profile of the cider, because this is the foam parameter most influenced by these compounds...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this PhD research project has been to evaluate some characteristics (e. g., allergens content, polyphenols profile and antioxidant potential) of the Italian ciders that could affect the human health. In this way we tried to promote the product contributing to improve the knowledge needed to better the production techniques. The first aspect described in this PhD study was the recovery of cider proteins (Chapter 2). The rationale was the knowledge that, in other fermented beverages, these molecules are described {{to be involved in}} specific organoleptic characteristics such as foam stability, in the interaction with the aroma compounds in the formation of hazes and sediments. In addition, proteins could elicit allergenic reactions in sensitive individuals. After the setup of the recovery methods, proteins purified from 18 commercial ciders were identified by LC-MS/MS technique. This high sensitive method revealed the presence of Mal d 2 and Mal d 3 proteins in all the cider samples analyzed. In addition, this technique showed that 12 out of 18 ciders are contaminated by hen egg lysozyme that is a well-known allergen, even if its use and presence was not declared on the label as stated by the EU Directive. Since the LC-MS/MS analysis detects only fragments of protein that could not be immunologically active, ELISA and western blot analyses were achieved for the detection of lysozyme. Two samples out of 18 were both positive to the assays applied and this confirm the immunological activity of the protein and the existence of a serious health concern to drink cider for people sensitized to egg (Chapter 3). The following step was to study the effect of <b>cidermaking</b> procedure on apple allergen. For this reason, the immunological activity of Mal d 2 and Mal d 3 proteins was tested with specific antibodies developed in rabbit. Six and four samples out of the 13 ciders considered were positive to Mal d 2 and Mal d 3, respectively. It is important to highlight that not all the samples showed a positive match to both the apple allergens. This could indicate that the technological process in <b>cidermaking</b> could achieve a selective removal of specific allergens. Moreover, as regarding Mal d 3 the antibody detected an ambiguous signal {{at the level of the}} stacking gel of almost all samples (Chapter 4). Finally, an aspect related to the wholesomeness of cider was investigated. The polyphenols profiles of 18 Italian ciders were correlated with their antioxidant activity, and a multiple linear regression model was drawn to predict the antioxidant potential of the beverage, knowing the concentration of specific phenols (namely: chlorogenic acid, catechin, procyanidins B 1 and B 2, quercetins 3 -glucoside, 3 -xyloside and 3 -arabinopyranoside). This suggests that these phenols could be the mainly contributors of the antioxidant activity, but further studies should be performed to exclude that this correlation could be only an epiphenomenon consequence of particular interactions among different molecules. Anyway the total antioxidant activities of Italian ciders results on average lower than those reported in literature for Asturian ones and this could be probably related to the total polyphenols content and their profiles (Chapter 5). This observation suggests that the Italian <b>cidermaking</b> process could be ameliorated taking in consideration both the allergenic profile of the beverage and the preferences of the Italian consumers. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of biogenic amines and other nitrogen compounds during the elaboration period of natural ciders in two successive seasons and {{two types of}} presses was studied. The harvest year affects the concentrations {{of most of the}} amino acids, while few of them were affected by the type of press. Asparagine and aspartic acid were the most abundant amino acids in fresh musts followed by α-alanine, α-aminobutyric acid, glutamine and glutamic acid. The mean concentrations of these amino acids in the fresh musts from the two harvest years were 12. 35, 11. 12, 6. 45, 6. 29, 5. 28 and 4. 87 mg L− 1, respectively. During <b>cidermaking,</b> a decrease in the sum of all amino acids was detected (from 128 ± 54. 311 mg L− 1 to 22. 5 ± 4. 863 mg L− 1 in 2005 and from 72. 2 ± 15. 256 mg L− 1 to 6. 5 ± 4. 112 mg L− 1 in 2006). Furthermore, significant differences in the concentration of most amino acids related to harvest year were observed. Concerning the biogenic amine content, putrescine was the main and the only amine present in all musts (3. 72 ± 1. 68 mg L− 1) and ciders (3. 59 ± 1. 83 mg L− 1). Histamine was the second biogenic amine of quantitative importance in final ciders (1. 15 ± 0. 69 mg L− 1), and tyramine was only detected in one of the cidermaker cellars {{at the end of the}} elaboration period. The low concentrations of biogenic amines in ciders were attributed to the low contents of the corresponding precursor amino acids and do not affect to cider quality,This study was supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (Projects, PET 2007 - 0134 and AGL 2006 n- 04514).
