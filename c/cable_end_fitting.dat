5000|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>end</b> <b>fittings</b> are {{the pieces}} that tie the system together. The cable {{attaches}} into {{one side of}} the fitting, while the other side attaches to the post (frame structure). <b>Cable</b> <b>ends</b> may tension, or just attach to the frame, depending on the individual needs of the project. [...] The requirements needed to decide whether to use tensioning or non-tensioning fittings are generally dependent upon the manufacturer's system requirements, your local building codes, and ICC requirements. To determine the type of <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> <b>fittings</b> needed, you'll need to know the distance you expect a single piece of cable to run without stopping, and the amount of tensioning ability of the fitting you expect to use. Individual manufacturers will help you to determine the rest.|$|R
5000|$|Cable Tension: An {{incredible}} amount of tension is generated on the end posts when ten or more cables, each tensioned at 200-400 lbs. over a height of 36" [...] to 42‚Äù exists. Underestimating the tension of <b>cables</b> applied to <b>end</b> poles can cause a safety hazard. Cable can have too much deflection allowing body parts to slip through, or cables can merely [...] "pull out" [...] of the <b>end</b> <b>fittings,</b> causing the <b>cable</b> rail to fail. Poorly designed end posts {{will result in a}} railing where the cables cannot be properly tensioned without an unacceptable amount of <b>cable</b> deflection. <b>End</b> posts to which the tensioning hardware attaches must be constructed so that they will not deflect perceptibly.|$|R

40|$|Composite tubes {{outperform}} traditional pipe {{materials in}} applications requiring low weight, corrosion resistance and high strength. However, {{the lack of}} simple and reliable <b>end</b> <b>fittings</b> have limited their use. A new <b>end</b> <b>fitting</b> design for composite tubes have been designed, produced and tested.

40|$|Cable {{guardrail}} {{systems have}} been increasing in popularity in recent years due to several perceived benefits over the commonly used W-beam guardrail. A non-proprietary design was desired {{as an alternative to}} the many proprietary designs available. A non-proprietary, high-tension <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> terminal was necessary to accompany the non-proprietary, high-tension cable guardrail system under development. The objective of this research project was to develop design recommendations for a non-proprietary, high-tension <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> terminal. An analysis of several <b>cable</b> guardrail <b>end</b> terminals was undertaken to identify any common features that may prove to be beneficial or detrimental to end terminal designs. Next, a study of the non-proprietary low-tension system was conducted to determine the cause of vehicle instabilities in full-scale testing. Since the high-tension and low-tension <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> terminal designs are similar, it is likely that any issues with the low-tension design will also be evident in testing of the high-tension design. LS-DYNA modeling of current cable terminal anchor hardware was then accomplished and compared to bogie testing results. The anchor model proved to be sufficiently accurate to preliminarily analyze alternative cable anchor designs. A final, optimized, high-tension cable anchor design was produced along with alternative terminal post recommendations for continuing development of the non-proprietary, high-tension <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> terminal.

40|$|This project {{presents}} {{the study of}} electric field stress along {{the surface of a}} 132 kV ceramic post insulator. Insulators are among the important devices of the electric power transmission systems. They are used to support and separate conductors at high voltage. Different insulator shapes have been obtained by varying several parameters, which defines the shape of the post insulator. For each insulator shape, the maximum electric field stress occurring on the insulator surface has been determined under clean and dry environment. The COMSOL Multiphysics software has been employed to investigate the electric field stress along the insulator‚Äôs surface. The full detailed model of a dry and clean ceramic 132 kV post insulator with 25 sheds has been developed for the base model calculation. The maximum value of electric field stress was found to be at the junction between the porcelain and the <b>end</b> <b>fitting.</b> <b>End</b> <b>fittings</b> with round edges tend to reduce the electric field stress along the insulator‚Äôs surface. With smaller first shed‚Äôs outer corner radius, the electric field stress slightly decreases. The electric field stress of the 25 th shed near the top <b>end</b> <b>fitting</b> tends to reduce as the shed‚Äôs inclination angle is increased. Furthermore, as the shed‚Äôs diameter increases, the electric field stress increases except at the shed‚Äôs outer corner where the electric field stress decreases. With greater distance between the first shed and the bottom <b>end</b> <b>fitting,</b> the electric field stress becomes lower. The <b>end</b> <b>fittings</b> design was found to be significantly affecting the electric field stress along the surface of the post insulator.

This study presents two different approaches for the demonstration of the damping effect due to wind action on cable-stayed bridge. The fi rst approach uses a simplifi ed analysis method to study the reaction force at the <b>cable</b> <b>end.</b> A beam element was adopted for modelling the cables and a plate element for modelling the bridge‚Äôs deck. The second approach {{is based on the}} selected damper system applied at the <b>cable</b> <b>end</b> to determine the reaction response at the bridge models.

40|$|A {{method has}} been devised {{to enable the}} {{fabrication}} of lightweight pressure vessels from multilayer composite materials. This method is related to, but not the same as, the method described in gMaking a Metal- Lined Composite-Overwrapped Pressure Vessel h (MFS- 31814), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 29, No. 3 (March 2005), page 59. The method is flexible in that it poses no major impediment to changes in tank design and is applicable {{to a wide range}} of tank sizes. The figure depicts a finished tank fabricated by this method, showing layers added at various stages of the fabrication process. In the first step of the process, a mandrel that defines the size and shape of the interior of the tank is machined from a polyurethane foam or other suitable lightweight tooling material. The mandrel is outfitted with metallic <b>end</b> <b>fittings</b> on a shaft. Each <b>end</b> <b>fitting</b> includes an outer flange that has a small step to accommodate a thin layer of graphite/epoxy or other suitable composite material. The outer surface of the mandrel (but not the fittings) is covered with a suitable release material. The composite material is filament- wound so as to cover the entire surface of the mandrel from the step on one <b>end</b> <b>fitting</b> to the step on the other <b>end</b> <b>fitting.</b> The composite material is then cured in place. The entire workpiece is cut in half in a plane perpendicular to the axis of symmetry at its mid-length point, yielding two composite-material half shells, each containing half of the foam mandrel. The halves of the mandrel are removed from within the composite shells, then the shells are reassembled and bonded together with a belly band of cured composite material. The resulting composite shell becomes a mandrel for the subsequent steps of the fabrication process and remains inside the final tank. The outer surface of the composite shell is covered with a layer of material designed to be impermeable by the pressurized fluid to be contained in the tank. A second step on the outer flange of each <b>end</b> <b>fitting</b> accommodates this layer. Depending on the application, this layer could be, for example, a layer of rubber, a polymer film, or an electrodeposited layer of metal. If the fluid to be contained in the tank is a gas, then the best permeation barrier is electrodeposited metal (typically copper or nickel), which can be effective at a thickness of as little as 0. 005 in (. 0. 13 mm). The electrodeposited metal becomes molecularly bonded to the second step on each metallic <b>end</b> <b>fitting.</b> The permeation-barrier layer is covered with many layers of filament-wound composite material, which could be the same as, or different from, the composite material of the inner shell. Finally, the filament-wound composite material is cured in an o...|$|R
