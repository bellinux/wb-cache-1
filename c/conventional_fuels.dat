25|$|Stirling engines {{have a high}} {{efficiency}} compared to steam engines, being able to reach 50% efficiency. They are also capable of quiet operation and can use almost any heat source. The heat energy source is generated external to the Stirling engine rather than by internal combustion as with the Otto cycle or Diesel cycle engines. Because the Stirling engine is compatible with alternative and renewable energy sources it could become increasingly significant {{as the price of}} <b>conventional</b> <b>fuels</b> rises, and also in light of concerns such as depletion of oil supplies and climate change. This type of engine is currently generating interest as the core component of micro combined heat and power (CHP) units, in which it is more efficient and safer than a comparable steam engine. However, it has a low power-to-weight ratio, rendering it more suitable for use in static installations where space and weight are not at a premium.|$|E

25|$|Whereas {{technical}} problems, such as harvesting, {{are being}} addressed successfully by the industry, the high up-front investment of algae-to-biofuels facilities {{is seen by}} many as a major obstacle to the success of this technology. Only few studies on the economic viability are publicly available, and must often rely on the little data (often only engineering estimates) available in the public domain. Dmitrov examined the GreenFuel's photobioreactor and estimated that algae oil would only be competitive at an oil price of $800 per barrel. A study by Alabi et al. examined raceways, photobioreactors and anaerobic fermenters to make biofuels from algae and found that photobioreactors are too expensive to make biofuels. Raceways might be cost-effective in warm climates with very low labor costs, and fermenters may become cost-effective subsequent to significant process improvements. The group found that capital cost, labor cost and operational costs (fertilizer, electricity, etc.) by themselves are too high for algae biofuels to be cost-competitive with <b>conventional</b> <b>fuels.</b> Similar results were found by others, suggesting that unless new, cheaper ways of harnessing algae for biofuels production are found, their great technical potential may never become economically accessible. Recently, Rodrigo E. Teixeira demonstrated a new reaction and proposed a process for harvesting and extracting raw materials for biofuel and chemical production that requires a fraction of the energy of current methods, while extracting all cell constituents.|$|E

40|$|Fully ceramic {{microencapsulated}} (FCM) fuel {{consists of}} TRISO (tristructural-isotropic) fuel particles {{embedded in a}} ceramic matrix (SiC) to form fuel pellets and rods and offers improved fission product retention and lower operating temperature with expected superior performance in normal and off-normal conditions compared to <b>conventional</b> <b>fuel.</b> When coupled with SiC cladding, FCM fuel eliminates zirconium altogether {{and is expected to}} drastically reduce hydrogen generation during a beyond-design- basis accident. In order to be deployed in current or future pressurized water reactors (PWRs), FCM fuel must meet or exceed the neutronic performance of <b>conventional</b> <b>fuel.</b> Limited by low heavy metal loading, an FCM fuel assembly requires increased enrichment and large fuel rods to match the cycle length of a <b>conventional</b> <b>fuel</b> assembly. This study investigated the core design, neutronics, and thermal hydraulics of a PWR loaded with FCM fuel and sought to optimize the assembly design to minimize the enrichment required to reach fuel performance similar to that of <b>conventional</b> <b>fuel.</b> It was found that the implementation of FCMfuel in a 17 X 17 assembly requires close to 20 % enrichment and large fuel rods. Such design performs comparably to <b>conventional</b> <b>fuel</b> (4. 5 % enrichment) in terms of cycle length, reactivity coefficients, intra-assembly power peaking factor, burnable poison penalty, and control rod worth but requires an increase of pumping power. A parametric analysis spanned a large design space varying fuel outer diameter and pitch-to- diameter ratio (P/D) and downselected two alternate assembly designs: 11 X 11 (1. 65 -cm outer diameter and 1. 18 P/D) and 9 X 9 (2. 12 -cm outer diameter and 1. 12 P/D). These designs meet the cycle length requirement with 18. 6 % and 16. 2 % enrichments, respectively, but feature a smaller minimum departure from nucleate boiling ratio (MDNBR) compared to a reference assembly. It was estimated that a slight increase in rod outer diameter increases MDNBR to the desired level and implies a pressure drop increase of 10 %...|$|R

2500|$|The {{amounts of}} helium-3 needed as a {{replacement}} for <b>conventional</b> <b>fuels</b> are substantial by comparison to amounts currently available. The total amount of energy produced in the 21H+32He reaction is 18.4 MeV, which corresponds to some 493 megawatt-hours (4.93×108 W·h) per three grams (one mole) of ³He. If the total amount of energy could be converted to electrical power with 100% efficiency (a physical impossibility), it would correspond to about 30 minutes of output of a gigawatt electrical plant per mole of 3He. [...] Thus, a year's production (at 6 grams for each operation hour) would require 52.5 kilograms of helium-3. The amount of fuel needed for large-scale applications can also be put in terms of total consumption: electricity consumption by 107 million U.S. households in 2001 totaled 1,140 billion kW·h (1.14×1015 W·h). Again assuming 100% conversion efficiency, 6.7 tonnes per year of helium-3 would be required for that segment of the energy demand of the United States, 15 to 20 tonnes per year given a more realistic end-to-end conversion efficiency.|$|E

Biomass or agriculture wastage a non <b>conventional</b> <b>fuel</b> is used and it is ensured that the use of non <b>conventional</b> <b>fuel</b> minimize the environmental degradation and also minimize the stress associated with mining, processing and transporting of <b>conventional</b> <b>fuel.</b> The numerous variables such as bed temperature, gas velocity, excess air, particle size distribution, bed and free board height that affect the combustion make the experimentation in full-scale furnaces very expensive. Therefore the best method to optimize the performance of furnaces is {{mathematical modelling}}. Bubbling fluidized bed as a combustion method is suitable for wide range of fuels even those fuel that have low quality. Percentage of Carbon dioxide in flue gas decreases with increase in the fraction of excess air. However the percentage of oxygen in the exit gas increases with increase in the fraction of excess air. With the increase in the bubble diameter, the oxygen conversion decreases. All the results from the model for rice husk are coming within permissible limits...|$|R
