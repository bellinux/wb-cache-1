40|$|For {{the first}} time, the {{new class of}} filter {{transfer}} functions, called <b>Chained</b> <b>Functions</b> is described, in detail. With <b>Chained</b> <b>functions,</b> one may define a new polynomial generating function that is given by {{the product of a}} combination of low order functions, called seed functions. The chained function concept provides with a variety of transfer functions, having the same order but different frequency-domain, time-domain and implementation characteristics. When compared to the conventional Chebyshev approximation, reduced sensitivity to manufacturing errors, lower resonator unloaded-Q requirements and, consequently, lower filter losses can be achieved by selecting the appropriate seed function combination for a given implementation technology. This can be achieved with out-of-band rejection levels ranging from those associated with Butterworth to pseudo-Chebyshev. Theoretical and experimental comparisons with conventional Chebyshev filter characteristics, presented in this thesis, demonstrate {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} this new family of filter transfer functions...|$|E
40|$|Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is {{enabling}} the softwarization of traditional network services, commonly deployed in dedicated hardware, into generic hardware {{in form of}} Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), which can be located flexibly in the network. However, network load balancing can be critical for an ordered sequence of VNFs, also known as Service Function Chains (SFCs), a common cloud and network service approach today. The placement of these <b>chained</b> <b>functions</b> increases the ping-pong traffic between VNFs, directly affecting to the efficiency of bandwidth utilization. The optimization of the placement of these VNFs is a challenge as also other factors need to be considered, such as the resource utilization. To address this issue, we study the problem of VNF placement with replications, and especially the potential of VNFs replications to help load balance the network, while the server utilization is minimized. In this paper we present a Linear Programming (LP) model for the optimum placement of functions finding a trade-off between the minimization of two objectives: the link utilization and CPU resource usage. The results show how the model load balance the utilization of all links in the network using minimum resources. Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1610. 0826...|$|E
40|$|Many {{companies}} have introduced the supply <b>chain</b> <b>function</b> in their organisation. Little attention, however, {{is devoted to}} the way the supply <b>chain</b> <b>function</b> is organised, e. g. the range of responsibilities it has, the position it occupies in the hierarchy and the skills it requires. The literature on this is scarce. This paper provides initial benchmarking data on company decisions regarding the roles and responsibilities of their supply chain managers and how the various supply chain tasks are coordinated and integrated. Our empirical study in the food, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries shows that differences in supply chain organisational structures are not random. We find that the way the supply <b>chain</b> <b>function</b> is organised seems to depend on the industry and its complexity and, we might speculate, on the strategy of the organisation. By highlighting and trying to explain these differences, we hope to raise top management awareness regarding the structuring options for their supply <b>chain</b> <b>function</b> and the importance of this issue for the organisation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Deciphering the {{mechanisms}} that control gene {{expression in the}} cell is a fundamental question in molecular biology. This task {{is complicated by the}} large number of possible regulation relations in the cell, and the relatively small amount of available experimental data. Recently, a new class of regulation <b>functions</b> called <b>chain</b> <b>functions</b> was suggested. Many signal transduction pathways can be accurately modeled by <b>chain</b> <b>functions,</b> and the restriction to <b>chain</b> <b>functions</b> greatly reduces the vast search space of regulation relations. In this paper we study the computational problem of reconstructing a <b>chain</b> <b>function</b> using a minimum number of experiments, in each of which only few genes are perturbed. We give optimal reconstruction schemes for several scenarios and show their application in reconstructing the regulation of galactose utilization in yeast. 1 Introduction The regulation of mRNA transcription is key to cellular function. High throughput genomic technologies, such as DNA microarrays, enable a global view of the transcriptome, and provide the means to reconstructing regulatory relations among genes, that is, inferring the set of genes that cooperate in the regulation of a given gene and the particular logical function by which this regulation is determined. This paper studies the number and complexity of biological experiments that are needed in order to infer certain regulatory relations. An experiment involves knocking out or over-expressing certain genes, and measuring the expression levels of all other genes. The order of an experiment is the number of genes that are perturbed. A key obstacle in the inference of regulation relations is the large number of possible solutions and, consequently, the unrealistically large amount of data needed to identify the right one.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of inland ports {{took place in}} several regions around the world, notably where the growth of inland freight distribution required a massification of flows.

This perspective requires the investigation of how transport and supply <b>chain</b> <b>functions</b> and the various actors involved in their setting and operations are taking shape in inland ports. Case studies pertaining to European and North American inland ports are presented.

Mitochondrial disorders are relatively common and have an estimated incidence of 1 : 10, 000 live births. There are more than 100 different point mutations and numerous large rearrangements of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA; mainly single deletions) that cause human disease. We aimed at obtaining an animal model to study physiological aspects of mtDNA mutation disorders. There are as yet unsolved technical problems associated with transfection of mammalian mitochondria. We therefore choose to manipulate mtDNA expression by targeting of the nuclear gene encoding Tfam. We utilised the cre-loxP recombination system to disrupt Tfam since this system allows manipulation of respiratory <b>chain</b> <b>function</b> in selected mouse tissues. We have found increased cell death or apoptosis induction in both germ line and tissue-specific Tfam knockouts. Our results further suggest that increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is not a prominent feature in cells with impaired mtDNA expression...|$|R

40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} {{theory of}} aging proposes that {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) generated inside the cell will lead, with time, to increasing amounts of oxidative damage to various cell components. The main site for ROS production is the respiratory chain inside the mitochondria and accumulation of mtDNA mutations, and impaired respiratory <b>chain</b> <b>function</b> {{have been associated with}} degenerative diseases and aging. The theory predicts that impaired respiratory <b>chain</b> <b>function</b> will augment ROS production and thereby increase the rate of mtDNA mutation accumulation, which, in turn, will further compromise respiratory <b>chain</b> <b>function.</b> Previously, we reported that mice expressing an error-prone version of the catalytic subunit of mtDNA polymerase accumulate a substantial burden of somatic mtDNA mutations, associated with premature aging phenotypes and reduced lifespan. Here we show that these mtDNA mutator mice accumulate mtDNA mutations in an approximately linear manner. The amount of ROS produced was normal, and no increased sensitivity to oxidative stress-induced cell death was observed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts from mtDNA mutator mice, despite the presence of a severe respiratory chain dysfunction. Expression levels of antioxidant defense enzymes, protein carbonylation levels, and aconitase enzyme activity measurements indicated no or only minor oxidative stress in tissues from mtDNA mutator mice. The premature aging phenotypes in mtDNA mutator mice are thus not generated by a vicious cycle of massively increased oxidative stress accompanied by exponential accumulation of mtDNA mutations. We propose instead that respiratory chain dysfunction per se is the primary inducer of premature aging in mtDNA mutator mice...|$|R

40|$|Patients with {{mitochondrial}} myopathies characteristically exhibit pronounced exercise intolerance, {{often associated}} with lactic acidosis, tachycardia and muscle weakness. These clinical features are attributable to impaired electron transport <b>chain</b> <b>function</b> in skeletal muscle. The usual etiology is a primary defect in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), where the severity of impairment is presumably linked to the ratio of mutant to wild-type mtDNA. This dissertation presents novel therapeutic approaches to these genetic defects, aimed at attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction and ameliorating the clinical condition by employing exercise training alone or in conjunction with pharmacological therapy. Dichloroacetate (DCA) was administered to augment mitochondrial capacity by activating pyruvate dehydrogenase, thereby decreasing lactic acidosis. Endurance and resistance training paradigms were employed to induce mitochondrial and satellite cell proliferation respectively. The goals were to augment respiratory <b>chain</b> <b>function,</b> increase levels of wild type mtDNA, and reverse effects of chronic inactivity. The effects of these treatments on functional and mitochondrial capacity were defined by changes in: (1) work capacity, oxygen utilization, and circulatory responses during maximal exercise; (2) heart rate and blood lactate during submaximal exercise; (3) recovery kinetics of phosphate-containing metabolites measured using phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31 P MRS); (4) scores on a quality of life questionnaire. The cellular correlates for these indices were defined by changes in: (1) mitochondrial volume, (2) respiratory chain enzyme activity, and (3) levels of mutant/wild-type mtDNA. Although DCA administration alone lowered blood lactate, endurance training was more effective in improving exercise capacity, heart rate and blood lactate, 31 P MRS recovery kinetics, and quality of life. Increased mitochondrial volume and respiratory <b>chain</b> <b>function</b> were closely linke...|$|R
