A variation on this has each coil handle two plugs, on cylinders which are 360 degrees out of phase (and therefore reach TDC at the same time); in the four-cycle engine this means that one plug will be sparking during {{the end of the}} exhaust stroke while the other fires at the usual time, a so-called [...] "wasted spark" [...] arrangement which has no drawbacks apart from faster spark plug erosion; the paired cylinders are 1/4 and 2/3.

The first step to start calculate we collects all the data engine of Grand Vitara Car, diameter of bore, length of stroke, volume of cylinder, and fuel used. After all the data has been collected.

Beside the fuel-injection, a significant change for the Z24i was the addition of an optical <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> <b>sensor</b> in the distributor rather than a vacuum advance and ignition module. This allowed the JECS throttle-body injection system to identify cylinder #1 top dead center (TDC).|$|E
30|$|As already discussed, gearbox torques are {{normally}} calculated based on dynamometer measurements {{that provide the}} variations of polished rod loads and positions. Modern dynamometer systems register these data in function of time but give no information on the <b>crank</b> <b>angles</b> valid at the measured times. This circumstance, however, prohibits a direct calculation of gearbox torques because all torque components depend on the <b>crank</b> <b>angle,</b> θ. Rod torque changes with the torque factor that varies with the crank angle; counterbalance torque is a direct function of <b>crank</b> <b>angle,</b> see Eqs.  1 – 3. Inertial torques are found from the acceleration patterns of different components of the pumping unit, these also change with the variation of the time history of <b>crank</b> <b>angle.</b> Gearbox torque components, therefore, can only be calculated if the change of <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> with time, θ(t), is determined from dynamometer measurements.|$|R
30|$|For each {{measured}} polished rod position, s(t), {{the corresponding}} <b>crank</b> <b>angle,</b> θ, is found when the above equation is satisfied; this procedure {{results in a}} series of <b>crank</b> <b>angles</b> in function of time, θ(t). This function, in turn, allows one to find the two important components of gearbox torque: rod and counterbalance torque. To calculate Rod Torque, the torque factor (TF) is found for each <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> from the kinematic analysis of the pumping unit; torque is the product of the torque factor and the measured polished rod load. Counterbalance Torque, on the other hand, varies simply with the sine function of the <b>crank</b> <b>angle.</b> Determination of the inertial torque components, too, necessitates the knowledge of the crank angle-time function, θ(t), since both the angular acceleration pattern of the beam, d 2 θ b/dt 2, and the angular acceleration of the crankshaft, d 2 θ/dt 2, change with the variation of the <b>crank</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|R

50|$|The 5S-FE was {{available}} in several variations each being distinguished by valve cover design. The first generation, introduced in the 1990-92 Celica GT/GT-S and MR2, had a power rating of 130 hp and 144 lbs-ft/torque. The second generation was introduced in 1993 with the fifth generation (ST184) Celica, and continued through the sixth generation (ST204) Celica. The second generation was also used in the MR2 (SW21) and Camry/Scepter (XV10) series and had a power output of 135 hp and 145 lbs-ft/torque. It had slightly less aggressive cams, no cold start injector, a knock sensor, and more aggressive tuning to give it slightly more power. In states that had adopted California emission standards the 5S-FE was rated at 130 hp and 145 lbs-ft/torque due mainly to emission equipment used to meet those emission regulations. The third generation was the last 5S-FE engine produced and {{was used in the}} 1997-01 Camry XV20 and 1999-01 Camry Solara; however, from 1996 onward, the engine received a <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> <b>sensor</b> instead of a cam angle sensor for a smoother idle. From 1997 to 1999 the engine produced 133 hp at 5,200 rpm and 147 lbs-ft/torque at 4,400 rpm. From 2000 to 2001, the engine received modest improvements to increase power output to 136 hp at 5,200 rpm and 150 lbs-ft/torque at 4,400 rpm. The 5S-FE was replaced in all applications by the 2.4 L 2AZ-FE.|$|E

40|$|The {{robustness}} {{of a new}} single-cylinder {{pressure sensor}} concept is experimentally demonstrated on a six-cylinder heavy-duty diesel engine. Using a single-cylinder pressure sensor and a <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> <b>sensor,</b> this single-cylinder pressure sensor concept estimates the in-cylinder pressure traces in the remaining cylinders by applying a real-time, flexible crankshaft model combined with an adaptation algorithm. The single-cylinder pressure sensor concept is implemented on CPU/field-programmable gate array–based hardware. For steady-state engine operating conditions, the added value of the adaptation algorithm is demonstrated for cases in which a fuel quantity change or start of injection change is applied in a single, non-instrumented cylinder. It is shown that for steady-state and transient engine conditions, the cylinder pressure traces and corresponding combustion parameters, indicated mean effective pressure, peak cylinder pressure, and crank angle at 50 % heat release, can be estimated with 1. 2 bar, 6. 0 bar, and 1. 1 CAD inaccuracy, respectively...|$|E

The content of the emission mostly harmful gases such as Nitrogen Oxide (NOx), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Hydrocarbon (HC) and Particulate Matter (PM). This thesis is aim to reduce diesel exhaust emission by using first stage seawater spray system. A spray chamber designed to setup together with the diesel engine for diesel experiment. The chamber {{is connected to the}} exhaust manifold to collect emission gas by using particle trap. Then, the emission data without seawater (WOS), with seawater (WS), and with electrolyzed seawater (WES) spray system for five variable engine speeds is analyzed using exhaust gas analyzer. The temperature change is also measured. The result had shown the comparison of emission concentration for three condition seawater sprays system in form of graph of emission concentration versus engine speeds. Most of the emission is reduce after flow through the spray chamber except for the oxygen that is increasing because of the additional oxygen in the seawater. The other emission is absorb by the alkaline seawater and dissolved in the seawater. The research had shown the effectiveness of alkaline seawater as a medium to reduce diesel exhaust emission. The emission WES spray is reducing more compares WS spray system.

40|$|The {{in-cylinder}} {{pressure is}} an important signal that gives information about the combustion process. To further improve engine performance, this information {{can be used as}} a feedback signal in a control system. Usually a pressure sensor is mounted in the cylinder to extract this information. A drawback with pressure sensors is that they are expensive and have issues with aging. This master’s thesis investigates the possibility to create a virtual sensor to estimate in-cylinder pressure based on <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> degree <b>sensor</b> (CAD-sensor) data and physical models of the heavy-duty engine. Instead of using the standard mounted CAD-sensor an optical high-precision sensor measures the elapsed time between equidistant angles. Based on this signal the instantaneous angular acceleration was estimated. Together with the inertia of the crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons, an estimation of the engine torque was calculated. To be able to extract in-cylinder pressure from the estimated torque, knowledge about how the in-cylinder pressure signal propagates in the drivetrain to accelerate the flywheel needs to be known. Two engine models based on the torque balance on the crankshaft are presented. The fundamental difference between them is how the crankshaft is modeled, rigid body or spring-mass-damper system. The latter captures torsional effects of the crankshaft. Comparisons between the estimated torque from sensor data and the two engine models are presented. It is found that torsional effects of the crankshaft is present at normal engine speeds and has a significant influence on the flywheel torque. A separation of the gas torque contribution from one cylinder is done with CAD-sensor data together with the rigid body engine model. The in-cylinder pressure is then estimated by using the inverse crank-slider function and a Kalman filter estimator. The estimated pressure captures part of the compression and most of the expansion at engine speeds below 1200 RPM. Due to the crank-slider geometry the pressure signal disappears at TDC. The torsional effects perturb the estimated pressure during the gas exchange cycle. Further development must be made if this method is to be used on heavy-duty applications in the future...|$|R

30|$|The basic {{requirement}} for the calculation of gearbox torques is the knowledge of polished rod loads in the function of <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> since rod torque is found by multiplying the load and the torque factor belonging to the same <b>crank</b> <b>angle.</b> This condition, however, is not met if data recorded on conventional dynamometer cards are used to find polished rod loads because these cards record the load against polished rod displacement. Thus the load versus <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> function, F(θ), must be derived before the torques on the speed reducer can be calculated. The procedure introduced in API Spec.  11 E (API 2008) and widely {{used for this purpose}} is based on data obtained from a conventional dynamometer survey.|$|R

30|$|As {{discussed}} previously, {{the basic}} requirement for an accurate calculation of gearbox torque components from dynamometer survey data is {{the knowledge of}} the variation of <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> versus time.

Measurement of engine speed of a combustion engine is carried out by sensor wheels mounted on the crankshaft. <b>Crank</b> <b>angles</b> can be estimated from the measured engine speed. But geometrical tolerances of a sensor wheel result in systematic errors in the measurement. To get the corrected speed, we have to determine these errors due to geometric tolerances. These geometrical tolerances can be estimated by solving a nonlinear system of equations which is formulated using a suitable physical model of kinetic energy balance of the crankshaft and the measurement of engine speed...|$|R

40|$|Diesel engine {{cylinder}} pressure measurements {{are widely used}} in field and lab applications to support among other control, monitoring and diagnostic applications. There are two methods to measure cylinder pressure, {{the use of a}} <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> encoder, which guarantees pressure samples at fixed <b>crank</b> <b>angles,</b> and the use of constant time sampling rate. The last is frequently used due to its simplicity or because of practical restrictions. However, in order to perform thermodynamic calculations it is necessary to attribute a <b>crank</b> <b>angle</b> value to each measured pressure value. But if the in-cycle rotational speed fluctuates and this is neglected, an error will result in the values derived from the processing of the measured cylinder pressure.
