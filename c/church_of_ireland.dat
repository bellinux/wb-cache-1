5|$|Disraeli's first premiership was {{dominated}} by the heated debate over the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ireland.</b> Although Ireland was overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, the Protestant Church remained the established church and was funded by direct taxation, which was greatly resented by the Catholic majority. An initial attempt by Disraeli to negotiate with Archbishop Manning {{the establishment of a}} Roman Catholic university in Dublin foundered in March when Gladstone moved resolutions to disestablish the Irish Church altogether. The proposal united the Liberals under Gladstone's leadership, while causing divisions among the Conservatives.|$|E

5|$|The {{office of}} Prelate {{was held by}} the Lord Archbishop of Armagh, the most senior clergyman in the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ireland.</b> The Prelate was not {{mentioned}} in the original statutes, but created by a warrant shortly afterwards, apparently because the Archbishop at the time had asked to be appointed to the post. Since the death of the last holder in 1885, the office of Prelate has remained vacant.|$|E
5|$|Ireland {{was further}} {{represented}} in the House of Lords by four Lords Spiritual, who sat in rotation for terms lasting one session each. At any one time, an Archbishop and three Bishops represented Ireland, with the seats passing according to a fixed rotation, except that those Lords Spiritual who were also elected to serve as representative peers would be omitted. The rotation was changed by the Church Temporalities Act of 1833, which merged many dioceses and degraded the archbishoprics of Tuam and Cashel to bishoprics. Following its disestablishment in 1871 by the Irish Church Act 1869, the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ireland</b> ceased to send spiritual representatives to the Lords.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ireland's</b> dioceses <b>of</b> Cork, Cloyne and Ross were {{effectively}} merged during rationalisation in the 1860s. The {{bishop of}} this tridiocese, Paul Colton, spends almost {{all his time}} in Cork.|$|R

5|$|Jonathan Swift, as Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, {{produced}} many sermons {{during his}} tenure from 1713 to 1745. Although Swift is better known today for his secular writings such as Gulliver's Travels, A Tale of a Tub, or the Drapier's Letters, Swift was known in Dublin for his sermons that were delivered every fifth Sunday. Of these sermons, Swift wrote down 35, of which 12 have been preserved. In his sermons Swift attempted to impart traditional <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ireland</b> values to his listeners in a plain manner.|$|E
5|$|Shankill Parish Church {{belongs to}} the Anglican <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ireland.</b> The {{original}} church was established at Oxford Island {{on the shore of}} Lough Neagh in 1411, but a new church was built in Lurgan on the site of what is now Shankill Cemetery in 1609 as the town became the main centre of settlement in the area. It was eventually found to be too small given the growth of the town, and the Irish Parliament granted permission to build a replacement in 1725 one mile away on the 'Green of Lurgan', now known as Church Place, where it stands to this day. It {{is believed to be the}} largest parish church in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Synge {{was born}} in Newtown Villas, Rathfarnham, County Dublin, on 16 April 1871. He was the {{youngest}} son {{in a family of}} eight children. His parents were members of the Protestant upper middle class. his father, John Hatch Synge, who was a barrister, came from a family of landed gentry in Glanmore Castle, County Wicklow. He was the uncle of brothers, mathematician John Lighton Synge and optical microscopy pioneer Edward Hutchinson Synge. Synge's paternal grandfather, also named John Synge, was an evangelical Christian involved in the movement that became the Plymouth Brethren and his maternal grandfather, Robert Traill, had been a <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ireland</b> rector in Schull, County Cork, who died in 1847 during the Great Irish Famine.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ireland</b> {{community}} had worshipped {{at the old}} church, which was in a ruinous state by 1829 when the new St. Paul's Church was built {{at the top of}} the hill, overlooking the town. The new Catholic church of St. Rynagh's had been constructed some three years earlier and on land given by the Armstrongs, the most influential and wealthiest Protestant family in the area, who consistently and energetically advocated Catholic Emancipation and repeal of the Penal Laws. This situation demonstrated the friendly relations that existed between the two communities in Banagher during those difficult times for Catholics in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The Order of St Patrick {{initially}} had thirteen officers: the Prelate, the Chancellor, the Registrar, the Usher, the Secretary, the Genealogist, the King of Arms, two heralds {{and four}} pursuivants. Many of these offices were held by clergymen of the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ireland,</b> the then-established church. After the disestablishment of the Church in 1871, the ecclesiastics {{were allowed to}} remain in office until their deaths, when the offices were either abolished or reassigned to lay officials. All offices except that of Registrar and King of Arms are now vacant.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the Presbyterian Church is the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century. The {{writings}} of Swiss/French theologian and lawyer John Calvin (1509–64) solidified much of the Reformed thinking that came before him {{in the form of}} the sermons and writings of Huldrych Zwingli. John Knox, a former Roman Catholic priest from Scotland who studied with Calvin in Geneva, Switzerland, took Calvin's teachings back to Scotland and led the Scottish Reformation of 1560. As a result, the Church of Scotland embraced Reformed theology and presbyterian polity. The Ulster Scots brought their Presbyterian faith with them to Ireland, where they laid the foundation of what would become the Presbyterian <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ireland.</b>|$|E

5|$|City {{status in}} Ireland is decided by {{legislative}} or royal charter. Dublin, with over 1 million {{residents in the}} Greater Dublin Area, is the largest city on the island. Belfast, with 579,726 residents, is the largest city in Northern Ireland. City status does not directly equate with population size. For example, Armagh, with 14,590 is {{the seat of the}} <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ireland</b> and the Roman Catholic Primate of All Ireland and was re-granted city status by Queen Elizabeth II in 1994 (having lost that status in local government reforms of 1840). In the Republic of Ireland, Kilkenny, seat of the Butler dynasty, while no longer a city for administrative purposes (since the 2001 Local Government Act), is entitled by law to continue to use the description.|$|E
5|$|Ireland's largest {{religious}} group is Christianity. The largest denomination is Roman Catholicism representing over 73% {{for the island}} (and about 87% of the Republic of Ireland). Most {{of the rest of}} the population adhere to one of the various Protestant denominations (about 48% of Northern Ireland). The largest is the Anglican <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ireland.</b> The Muslim community is growing in Ireland, mostly through increased immigration, with a 50% increase in the republic between the 2006 and 2011 census. The island has a small Jewish community. About 4% of the Republic's population and about 14% of the Northern Ireland population describe themselves as of no religion. In a 2010 survey conducted on behalf of the Irish Times, 32% of respondents said they went to a religious service more than once a week.|$|E
5|$|The patent issue {{soon became}} a {{struggle}} between Prime Minister Robert Walpole (with {{the authority of the}} British Parliament) and the leaders of Ireland. All attempts by the Irish Privy Council and the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ireland</b> to prevent the release of the coinage proved fruitless. It was soon thought by many that William Conolly’s Commissioners of the Revenue might pay the soldiers stationed in Ireland with the new coin; if the soldiers were paid with the coin, then the merchants of Ireland would be forced to accept the coin from the soldiers or risk military reprisal or a loss of business. This worried the leadership of Ireland and they requested help in challenging Wood's patent and leading a boycott of the coin. Swift was asked by Archbishop King and Lord Chancellor Midleton to contribute to a pamphleteering campaign against Wood's coin.|$|E

5|$|The {{sovereign}} is the Supreme Governor of {{the established}} Church of England. Archbishops and bishops are appointed by the monarch, {{on the advice of}} the Prime Minister, who chooses the appointee from a list of nominees prepared by a Church Commission. The Crown's role in the Church of England is titular; the most senior clergyman, the Archbishop of Canterbury, is the spiritual leader of the Church and of the worldwide Anglican Communion. The monarch takes an oath to preserve Church of Scotland and he or she holds the power to appoint the Lord High Commissioner to the Church's General Assembly, but otherwise plays no part in its governance, and exerts no powers over it. The Sovereign plays no formal role in the disestablished Church in Wales or <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ireland.</b>|$|E
5|$|This period saw the {{establishment}} of Qualified Chapels, where worship was conducted according to the English Book of Common Prayer and where congregations, led by priests ordained by Bishops of the Church of England or the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ireland,</b> were willing to pray for the Hanoverians. Such chapels drew their congregations from English people living in Scotland and from Scottish Episcopalians who were not bound to the Jacobite cause. These two forms of episcopalianism existed side by side until 1788 when the Jacobite claimant Charles Edward Stuart died in exile. Unwilling to recognise his brother Henry Benedict Stuart, who was a cardinal in the Roman Catholic Church, as his heir, the non-juror Episcopalians elected to recognise the House of Hanover and offer allegiance to George III. At {{the repeal of the}} penal laws in 1792 there were twenty-four Qualified Chapels in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte's Way, {{formerly}} known as Hill House, {{is located in a}} prominent setting close to Saint Paul's <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ireland</b> church. This house was once the home of Charlotte Brontë's husband, Mr. Nicholls, who returned to Banagher after Charlotte's death. Nicholls remarried and lived at Hill House until his death in 1906. The house was sold to a Major Bell in 1919. He died in 1944 and his wife inherited the property. Florence Bell died in 1959. This connection to Brontë, one of the most renowned writers of the 19th century, is revealed in its present name, giving the house cultural interest. It is a detached three-bay two-storey house, built in 1753, with a gabled central bay to the façade with modern porch and single-bay two-storey wing to the south and two-bay two-storey wing to the north. It is now used as a bed and breakfast and visitors can enjoy its restored appearance and sense the history of a place connected in a curious way with the Brontë family.|$|E
