40|$|That {{the more}} {{distressing}} symptoms of Parkin-sonism and other hyperkinetic disorders may be relieved surgically has now gained general accep-tance. At {{the present time}} procedures in which destructive lesions, localized by a stereotactic method and made through a small cranial opening, have gained almost universal preference. It is proposed to describe such a technique. It {{has been found to}} work well in practice, disturbance to the patient is minimal, electro-physiological studies are facilitated since general anaesthesia is unnecessary, and the stereotactic instrument used is relatively inexpensive. Stereotaxis In practice, since most workers in the field of human stereotaxy use part of the visualized ventri-cular system as a reference point in localization (Hankinson and Amador, 1956), the problem is reduced to the insertion of a cannula or electrode through the skull in the direction of an identical point plotted on two radiographs taken in planes at right angles to each other. The depth of insertion must also be known. It has been found that a high degree of accuracy is obtainable by the use of a direction indicator so constructed that an adjustment in one plane can be made without altering the position in that at right angles to it. Description of Instrument The instrument (Fig. 1), made of stainless steel, consists of a ball drilled centrally and fitted to an electrode or <b>cannula</b> <b>carrier</b> (a). Into this carrier a directing rod (b) can be inserted. Two lead-containing markers (c) are fitted to the rod {{in such a way that}} the distance between. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{to enhance}} the {{efficiency}} of medical rehabilitation in patients who have undergone mechanical ventilation (MV) and tracheostomy in an intensive care unit through dynamic clinical, laboratory, endoscopic control and adequate therapy for detected pathology. A total of 120 intensive care unit patients who had undergone tracheostomy in different MV periods were examined. Subjects and methods. A total of 120 patients (76 men and 44 women) aged 15 to 78 years were examined in different MV periods. All the patients were operated on in intensive care units. The surgical techniques of tracheostomy were described; the clinical and endoscopic pattern of the laryngeal and tracheal mucosa in patients on MV was presented. The bacteria isolated from the patients on MV were typed; the cartilages of the anterior tracheal wall were pathomorphologically studied in different MV periods. Results. Microbiological examination indicated the predominance of the mixed microflora: Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus. Intraoperative postmortem examination of the cartilages of the anterior tracheal wall was made in 30 patients in different MV periods who were noted to develop pathological changes in the laryngeal and tracheal mucosa and destructive and dystrophic alterations in the tracheal cartilage even if their intubation lasted as long as 3 days. Morphological examination of tracheal cartilages in patients who were on MV for 4 to 7 days revealed progressive destructive and dystrophic processes in peretracheal connective tissue, leukocyte accumulation, and focal bleeding. During intubation for more 7 days, there was partial death of the cartilage, its replacement by granulation tissue, and appearance of regions of sequestration of the dead cartilage. Endoscopic examination showed varying degrees of postintubation laryngeal and tracheal changes in all (n= 120) the examinees. Conclusion. The performed treatment permitted decannulation of 111 patients; 16 patients underwent endoscopic intervention into the larynx and trachea; reconstructive operations followed by decannulaton were performed in 4 patients with postintubation laryngeal and tracheal stenosis; 5 patients with severe comorbidity remained to be chronic <b>cannula</b> <b>carriers.</b> </p...|$|R
