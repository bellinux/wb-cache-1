25|$|The planet Venus has {{a surface}} that is 90% basalt, {{indicating}} that volcanism {{played a major}} role in shaping its surface. The planet may have had a major global resurfacing event about 500 million years ago, from what scientists <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> the density of impact craters on the surface. Lava flows are widespread and forms of volcanism not present on Earth occur as well. Changes in the planet's atmosphere and observations of lightning have been attributed to ongoing volcanic eruptions, although there is no confirmation of whether or not Venus is still volcanically active. However, radar sounding by the Magellan probe revealed evidence for comparatively recent volcanic activity at Venus's highest volcano Maat Mons, in the form of ash flows near the summit and on the northern flank.|$|E
25|$|Cycling in Melbourne is {{a popular}} pastime, as one <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> the bevy of cyclists and paths that lie all {{throughout}} the city, {{as well as a}} spectator sport. Melbourne's flat terrain and extensive off-road paths in green wedges are conducive to riding. Beach Road combines with the Nepean Highway to form a 90-kilometre stretch from Port Melbourne to Sorrento, incorporating the Bayside Trail. It is the city's most popular training route and attracts cyclists from around the world. Thousands of commuters cycle the roads, bike lanes and bike paths daily. Bicycle Victoria's annual events, Around the Bay in a Day and Ride to Work Day, attract tens of thousands of Melburnians. Other events such as the Herald Sun Tour begin and end in the Melbourne area and there are many local cycling events of varying grades all year round.|$|E

500|$|Live from Paris {{received}} generally favourable {{reviews from}} critics. Carlos Quintana from About.com gave the DVD {{a very positive}} review and praised the selection of songs, saying they were reflective of Shakira's [...] "evolution as an artist", and also commended her talent and performance, writing, [...] "Besides her sensual dancing, unique voice and great energy, you <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> the images on the DVD {{she is a very}} professional artist who takes her job very seriously". He concluded by calling the audio CD of Live from Paris a [...] "compilation [...] covers in a good way her musical spectrum" [...] and the DVD [...] "fantastic" [...] due to [...] "the high quality of the sound and the video"; he also commented that the live album [...] "offers a good overview of Shakira's musical career". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic complimented the energy of the audio CD and Shakira's versatility, commenting she [...] "leans heavily on glitzy electro-dance crossovers but finds room for quieter moments, whether it’s a stripped-down cover of Metallica's [...] "Nothing Else Matters" [...] or her own [...] "Gypsy", keeping the momentum running throughout a lengthy set, then bringing down the house with [...] "Waka Waka". He, however, found the video versions much more impressive, opining that they [...] "give a greater indication {{of the size of the}} spectacle" [...] and [...] "emphasize Shakira's intense charisma". Adam Markovitz from Entertainment Weekly gave the live album a mixed review; he praised the visual show Shakira put up, but was critical of her vocals, saying [...] "she writhes and dry-humps through her catalog like the world's highest-paid strip-aerobics instructor, showing off plenty of skin — but sadly, not much musicianship". He also felt that Shakira's performance was too sexual, commenting that she [...] "sometimes comes off more stripper than superstar". The album was nominated [...] "Best Live DVD" [...] at the 2012 Premios Shock awards ceremony, ...|$|E

[...] Fey previously stated that {{there would not be}} a romantic relationship between the two, as it would be [...] "too icky." [...] More recently, however, she admitted there is sexual tension between Jack and Liz. Jack passes Liz off as his girlfriend to make ex-wife Bianca jealous and Bianca tells Liz in one scene that [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> the way he [...] looks at you that he's serious". Colleen Donaghy, Jack's mother, thinks that Liz is a perfect match for Jack. In [...] "Do-Over", Jack and Liz attempt to win over temporary head of GE, Kathy Geiss by pretending to have a soap opera-style real life relationship, escalating to the point where Geiss wants the two to kiss each other (her shouting [...] "KISS!" [...] marks the only time Kathy Geiss has spoken in the entire series); there is a pause, but Jack and Liz refuse.|$|E
