5|$|The {{first signs}} of panic were seen {{when a group of}} {{passengers}} attempted to rush port-side lifeboat No.14 as it was being lowered with 40people aboard. Fifth Officer Lowe, {{who was in charge of}} the boat, fired three warning shots in the air to control the crowd without causing injuries. No.16 was lowered five minutes later. Among those aboard was stewardess Violet Jessop, who would repeat the experience four years later when she survived the sinking of one of Titanics sister ships, , in the First World War. <b>Collapsible</b> <b>boat</b> C was launched at 01:40 from a now largely deserted area of the deck, as most of those on deck had moved to the stern of the ship. It was aboard this boat that White Star chairman and managing director J. Bruce Ismay, Titanics most controversial survivor, made his escape from the ship, an act later condemned as cowardice.|$|E
5|$|The first {{lifeboat}} launched was Lifeboat 7 on {{the starboard}} side with 28 people on board out of a capacity of 65. It was lowered at around 12:45am as believed by the British Inquiry. <b>Collapsible</b> <b>Boat</b> D was the last lifeboat to be launched, at 2:05. Two more lifeboats, Collapsible Boats A and B, {{were in the process}} of being removed from their location on the roof of the officer's house but could not be properly launched. Collapsible B floated away from the ship upside down, while Collapsible A became half-filled with water after the supports for its canvas sides were broken in the fall from the roof of the officers' quarters. There were arguments in some of the lifeboats about going back to pick up people in the water, but many survivors were afraid of being swamped by people trying to climb into the lifeboat or being pulled down by the suction from the sinking Titanic, though it turned out that there had been very little suction. At 2:20am, Titanic herself sank. A small number of passengers and crew were able to make their way to the two unlaunched collapsible boats, surviving for several hours (some still clinging to the overturned Collapsible B) until they were rescued by Fifth Officer Harold Lowe.|$|E
25|$|Eighteen {{lifeboats}} were used, loading between 11:45–2:15a.m., though <b>Collapsible</b> <b>Boat</b> A floated off deck partially submerged, and <b>Collapsible</b> <b>Boat</b> B floated away {{upside down}} {{minutes before the}} ship upended and sank.|$|E
25|$|The 40 {{collapsible}} lifeboats {{were transferred}} from troopships {{and put on}} Olympic, and many were rotten and would not open. The crewmen, instead, sent a request to the Southampton manager of the White Star Line that the <b>collapsible</b> <b>boats</b> be replaced by wooden lifeboats; the manager replied that this was impossible and that the <b>collapsible</b> <b>boats</b> had been passed as seaworthy by a Board of Trade inspector. The men were not satisfied and ceased work in protest.|$|R

25|$|<b>Collapsible</b> <b>Boat</b> A {{reached the}} deck {{the right way}} up and was being {{attached}} to the falls by Murdoch and Moody when it was washed off Titanic at 2:15a.m. In the chaos, the canvas sides were not pulled up and the boat drifted away from the ship partially submerged and dangerously overloaded. Many of the occupants climbed in from the water but many (at least seven or eight, including the first class passenger Thomson Beattie, the third class passengers Arthur Keefe, Edvard Lindell and Gerda Lindell, {{and a couple of}} firemen) died of hypothermia or fell back into the sea. By the time the survivors were transferred into <b>Collapsible</b> <b>Boat</b> D, only about 12 or 13 people were left alive, Rhoda Abbott, who had lost her two young sons in the water, being the only female. Three bodies, including that of Mr. Beattie, were left in Collapsible A, which was allowed to drift off; they were not recovered until a month later, by , another White Star Line ship.|$|E
25|$|Titanics {{passengers}} {{endured a}} cold night before {{being picked up}} by RMS Carpathia {{on the morning of}} 15 April. Boat 2 was the first to be recovered, at 4:10a.m., with Boat 12 the last, at 8:15a.m. Boats 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 16 were brought aboard Carpathia, with the rest (including all four collapsible boats) set adrift. <b>Collapsible</b> <b>Boat</b> B was found again a few days later by the Canadian cable vessel Mackay-Bennett but an attempt to bring it on board failed and it was abandoned for good.|$|E
25|$|Several hundred soldiers, FBI agents, and Papago Indian scouts were mobilized {{to search}} for the Germans and all of them were {{eventually}} caught {{over the next few weeks}} without a single shot fired. Most knew they had very little chance of getting back to Germany and were found in Maricopa County, however, a few did attempt to make the journey to Mexico. On January 1, 1945, two unnamed prisoners were captured by Papagos less than thirty miles from the border. Soon after, Captain Lieutenants Friedrich Guggenberger and Jürgen Quaet-Faslem were captured within ten miles. One group of three men even built a <b>collapsible</b> <b>boat</b> to sail down the Gila River, but, to their disappointment, they found the river mostly dry and ended up leaving the boat behind.|$|E
50|$|During the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries Romsey became notable for making <b>collapsible</b> <b>boats,</b> invented by the Rev. Edward Lyon Berthon in 1851. The Berthon Boatyard in Romsey made the boats from 1870 until 1917. They {{were used as}} {{lifeboats}} on ocean-going liners.|$|R
25|$|Ninja {{utilized}} a large {{variety of}} tools and weaponry, {{some of which}} were commonly known, but others were more specialized. Most were tools used in the infiltration of castles. A wide range of specialized equipment is described and illustrated in the 17th century Bansenshukai, including climbing equipment, extending spears, rocket-propelled arrows, and small <b>collapsible</b> <b>boats.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{conquest of}} the maranaos was {{entrusted}} to captain Francesco Atienza, the alcalde mayor of caraga. With fifty Spaniards and five hundred caragaus, the captain landed in Bayug, then proceeded to maranao territory, reaching the lake on 4 April 1639, there we around 500 families or 800 inhabitant. The Spaniards brought with them six <b>collapsible</b> <b>boats</b> which they fitted out in the lake.|$|R
25|$|By 08:45, {{the list}} {{was so great that}} even the gantry davits were now inoperable. At this point, Bartlett {{concluded}} that the rate at which Britannic was sinking had slowed so he called a halt to the evacuation and ordered the engines restarted in the hope that he might still be able to beach the ship. At 09:00 Bartlett was informed that the rate of flooding had increased due to the ship's forward motion and that the flooding had reached D-deck. Realising that there was now no hope of reaching land in time, Bartlett gave the final order to stop the engines and sounded two final long blasts of the whistle. As water had already reached the bridge, he and Assistant Commander Dyke walked off onto the deck and entered the water, swimming to a <b>collapsible</b> <b>boat</b> from which they continued to coordinate the rescue operations.|$|E
25|$|Boat 4 {{appears to}} have had about 42 people aboard (about 40 women and {{children}} and two or three crew members) when it was lowered. As it had been ordered, Perkis steered the boat {{along the side of the}} ship in search for open gangways, since he had been told to take on board more passengers through them, but found no one. This way, the boat ended up near the davits of Boat 16 (which had been already launched), and two greasers, Thomas Ranger and Frederick William Scott, who were standing near them, climbed down the falls to Boat 4 (Scott fell into the water but was hauled aboard the lifeboat). The boat then rowed away from the ship in order to avoid suction. A third man, lamp trimmer Samuel Ernest Hemming, climbed down the falls of another lifeboat and swam over to No. 4, which was about 200 yards far. Immediately after the sinking the boat rowed back to the wreckage to pick up more survivors (the only lifeboat to try immediately to do so). The boat picked up six or seven more men (trimmer Thomas Patrick Dillon, seaman William Henry Lyons, stewards Andrew Cunningham and Sidney Conrad Siebert, storekeeper Frank Winnold Prentice, and one or two more unidentified swimmers) from the water. Two (Siebert and Lyons) later died of exposure. The number of occupants later increased when other people were transferred from Boat 14 and <b>Collapsible</b> <b>Boat</b> D. By the time it reached Carpathia at 8:00a.m. it had about 60 occupants.|$|E
500|$|The {{ship was}} also {{outfitted}} with four whaleboats, [...] long and [...] wide, and a flat-bottomed scow. During his previous Arctic expeditions, Hall came {{to admire the}} Inuit umiak, and brought a similarly constructed <b>collapsible</b> <b>boat</b> which could hold 20men. Food packed on board consisted of tinned ham, salted beef, bread and sailor's biscuit. The men intended to supplement their diet with fresh muskox, seal and polar bear, in order to ward off scurvy.|$|E
50|$|The event dogged the {{division}} afterwards with a poor reputation until 29 September 1918, during the Hundred Days Offensive, when it re-established its {{name at the}} Battle of St. Quentin Canal where, utilising life-belts and <b>collapsible</b> <b>boats,</b> it crossed the formidable obstacle of the canal and used scaling ladders to surmount the steep gradient of the opposite bank and captured multiple fortified machine-gun posts.|$|R
50|$|The {{conquest of}} the Maranaos was {{entrusted}} to Captain Francesco Atienza, the Alcalde Mayor of Caraga. With fifty Spaniards and five hundred Caragans, the captain landed in Bayug, then proceeded to the Maranao territory, reaching the lake on 4, April 1639.

50|$|Many men {{and some}} women and {{children}} die of hypothermia or drowning. One of the overturned <b>collapsible</b> <b>boats</b> is floating, so Lightoller {{and a few more}} men balance on it and wait. Chief Baker Charles Joughin is found in the water, not minding the cold because hes been drinking, and is pulled onto the boat. Lightoller spots another boat, and the men are saved. The Carpathia comes and rescues the survivors.|$|R
500|$|Only a few {{of those}} in the water survived. Among them were Archibald Gracie, Jack Thayer and Charles Lightoller, who made it to the capsized <b>collapsible</b> <b>boat</b> B. Around 12 crew members climbed on board Collapsible B, and they rescued those they could until some 35 men were {{clinging}} precariously to the upturned hull. Realising the risk to the boat of being swamped by the mass of swimmers around them, they paddled slowly away, ignoring the pleas of dozens of swimmers to be allowed on board. In his account, Gracie wrote of the admiration he had for those in the water; [...] "In no instance, I am happy to say, did I hear any word of rebuke from a swimmer because of a refusal to grant assistance... was met with the manly voice of a powerful man... 'All right boys, good luck and God bless you'." [...] Several other swimmers (probably 20 or more) reached <b>Collapsible</b> <b>boat</b> A, which was upright but partly flooded, as its sides had not been properly raised. Its occupants had to sit for hours in a foot of freezing water, and many died of hypothermia during the night.|$|E
500|$|Whatever the unmentioned plan was, an {{expedition}} to try for the Pole was dispatched on June 6, 1872. Chester led the expedition in a whaleboat, but this was crushed by the ice within {{a few miles of}} Polaris. Chester and his men hiked back to the ship, and persuaded Budington to give them the <b>collapsible</b> <b>boat.</b> With this, and Tyson piloting another whaleboat, the men set northward again. In the meantime, the Polaris had found open water, and was searching for a route south. Budington, not eager to spend another winter in the ice, sent Ebierbing north with orders for the Tyson and Chester: return to the ship at once. The men were forced to abandon both craft and walk [...] back to Polaris. Now three of the ship's precious lifeboats were lost, and a fourth (the small scow) would be crushed by ice in July after being carelessly left out overnight. The expedition had failed in its main objective to reach the North Pole.|$|E
500|$|In {{the other}} boats, {{there was nothing}} the {{survivors}} could do but await the arrival of rescue ships. The air was bitterly cold {{and several of the}} boats had taken on water. The survivors could not find any food or drinkable water in the boats, and most had no lights. The situation was particularly bad aboard collapsible B, which was only kept afloat by a diminishing air pocket in the upturned hull. As dawn approached, the wind rose and the sea became increasingly choppy, forcing those on the <b>collapsible</b> <b>boat</b> to stand up to balance it. Some, exhausted by the ordeal, fell off into the sea and were drowned. It became steadily harder for the rest to keep their balance on the hull, with waves washing across it. Archibald Gracie later wrote of how he and the other survivors sitting on the upturned hull were struck by [...] "the utter helplessness of our position." [...] Some swimmers who had reached collapsible A had not enough strength to come aboard, and had to cling to the boat's sides. The bodies {{of the majority of the}} people who died during the night were lowered into the sea to make more room for the survivors.|$|E

2500|$|According to Suetonius, Nero {{was annoyed}} {{at his mother}} being too watchful and tried three times to poison Agrippina, but she took the antidotes in time and survived. He then tried to crush her with a {{mechanical}} ceiling over her bed at her residence. After this failed, he devised a <b>collapsible</b> <b>boat,</b> which would either have its cabin fall in or become shipwrecked. [...] Nero then ordered captains of a different boat to ram this boat while Agrippina was aboard. [...] Nero heard Agrippina survived the wreck so he ordered her to be executed and framed it as a suicide.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1912 Thayer {{and his family had}} been in Europe as guests of the American Consul General in Berlin, Germany. On April 10 the family boarded the RMS Titanic at Cherbourg-en-Cotentin as {{first-class}} passengers and had been preparing for bed on the evening of April 14 when the collision with the iceberg occurred. As the ship sank, Thayer made sure his wife and maid boarded lifeboats, after being told by the Titanic's designer, Thomas Andrews, that the stricken ship did not have [...] "much over an hour to live". His son, Jack, dove from the sinking ship and was able to swim to an overturned <b>collapsible</b> <b>boat,</b> where he also survived. [...] However, Thayer Sr. {{made it clear that he}} had no intention of boarding a boat, and he remained on the Titanic as it went down. When all of the lifeboats were gone, one eyewitness reportedly saw Thayer looking [...] "pale and determined by the midship rail aft of lifeboat 7." [...] A short while later, he had gone, so it is likely that he moved to the stern like many other passengers and crew.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} <b>Collapsible</b> <b>Boat</b> D was {{launched}} at 2:05a.m., {{there were still}} 1,500 people on board Titanic and only 47 seats in the lifeboat. Crew members formed {{a circle around the}} boat to ensure that only women and children could board. Two small boys were brought through the cordon by a man calling himself [...] "Louis Hoffman". His real name was Michel Navratil; he was a Slovak tailor who had kidnapped his sons from his estranged wife and was taking them to the United States. He did not board the lifeboat and died when the ship sank. The identity of the children, who became known as the [...] "Titanic Orphans", was a mystery for some time after the sinking and was only resolved when Navratil's wife recognised them from photographs that had been circulated around the world. The older of the two boys, Michel Marcel Navratil, was the last living male survivor of the disaster. First Class passenger Edith Evans gave up her place in the lifeboat to Caroline Brown, who became the last passenger to enter a lifeboat from the davits. Evans became one of only four First Class women to perish in the disaster.|$|E
25|$|On 25 April, a {{deputation}} of strikers {{witnessed a}} test of four of the <b>collapsible</b> <b>boats.</b> Only one was unseaworthy {{and they said that}} they were prepared to recommend the men return to work if it was replaced.

We slowed to little more than steerage-way and lay listening. Presently a hand-bellows foghorn jarred like a corncrake, and there rattled out of the mist a big ship literally above us.
