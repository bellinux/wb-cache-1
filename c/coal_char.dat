The effects of the <b>coal</b> <b>char</b> catalyst pretreatment and the ratio of CO 2 /CH 4 were studied. Experimental {{results showed that the}} <b>coal</b> <b>char</b> was an effective catalyst for production of syngas, and addition of CO 2 did not enhance the CH 4 reforming to H 2. It was also found that the product gas ratio of H 2 /CO is strongly influenced by the feed ratio of CO 2 /CH 4. The modified <b>coal</b> <b>char</b> catalyst was more active during the CO 2 –CH 4 reforming than the <b>coal</b> <b>char</b> catalyst based on the catalyst volume, furthermore the modified catalyst exhibited high activity in CO 2 –CH 4 reforming to syngas. The conversion of methane can be divided into two stages. In the first stage, the conversion of CH 4 gradually decreased. In the second stage, the conversion of methane maintained nearly constant. The conversion of CO 2 decreased slightly during the overall reactions in CO 2 –CH 4 reforming. The <b>coal</b> <b>char</b> catalyst is a highly promising catalyst for the CO 2 reforming of methane to syngas...|$|E

To {{study the}} {{fluidization}} properties and mixing properties of binary mixtures of quartz sand and <b>coal</b> <b>char,</b> the experiments {{were carried out}} in fluidized bed with an inner diameter of 50 mm.

The result showed that the static bed height does not make an appreciable influence to minimum fluidization velocity and fluidization status. However, the volume fraction of <b>coal</b> <b>char</b> affected the minimum fluidization velocity obviously, and the minimum fluidization velocity decreased monotonously with decreasing the volume fraction.

Three nth-order representative gas-solid models – the volumetric model (VM), the grain model (GM) and the random pore model (RPM) – were employed to describe the reactive behaviour of the chars.

40|$|The {{following}} {{was accomplished}} during the reporting period: The random pore model {{was extended to}} correlate the development of microporosity in resin and Wyodak <b>coal</b> <b>char.</b> Conclusions derived from this analysis include: the random pore model can be extended to microporosity development for chars which are initially (i. e., at zero burn-off) microporous, assuming a normal micropore volume distribution. The resultant mean pore radius and variance prior to oxidation were, respectively, 1. 04 nm and 0. 24 nm for Wyodak <b>coal</b> <b>char,</b> and 0. 64 nm and 0. 18 nm for resin char. Consequently, the pore size is larger, and the pore distribution is broader for Wyodak <b>coal</b> <b>char</b> than for resin char prior to activation. The rate of mean micropore radius decrease with burn-off at high conversion is slower for resin char than for Wyodak <b>coal</b> <b>char.</b> This result suggests {{that the percentage of}} micropores converted to larger pores is smaller for resin char than for Wyodak coal char; i. e., resin char remains more microporous with burn-off. The nonmicroporous surface area was estimated by difference from the total surface area as determined from nitrogen adsorption data.

The gasification rate of the cola into CO was enhanced in the molten salt by 3. 3 times, compared with that without the molten salt. The reason for the enhancement was discussed. Main factor would be the enhancement of the <b>coal</b> <b>charring</b> owing to the efficient heat flow from the molten salt tot the coal through the solid/liquid interface between the coal surface and the molten salt. Another reason would be the catalytic effect of the alkaline cations (Kf, Na') on the Boudouard reaction (C + CO, = 2 CO). This coal gasification process (CG-CO,/molten salt) is an endothermic process (<b>coal</b> <b>charring</b> and Boudouard reactions), and can be applied for the solar thermochemical process to convert solar energy into chemical energy and store it.
