Methods to disclose information with molecular techniques, such as array <b>comparative</b> <b>genomic</b> <b>hybridisation</b> (aCGH) have rapidly developed but are still not optimal. Array <b>comparative</b> <b>genomic</b> <b>hybridisation</b> is one efficient method for finding tumour suppressors and oncogenes in solid tumours, and also for classification of tumours.

Unfortunately, DNA from archival tissues is not always suitable for molecular analysis due to insufficient quality. Until now, this quality remained undefined.

40|$|Nonallelic {{homologous}} recombination (NAHR) mediated by LCRs (low-copy repeats) produces chromosomal rearrangements {{in the human}} genome. Those rearrangements include microdeletion and microduplication. Those mutations cause {{a great number of}} syndromes and thus are studied along with its genesis. Studies are enabled by the development of methods, which are able to detect those cryptic aberrations, e. g. <b>comparative</b> <b>genomic</b> <b>hybridisation</b> (CGH). Nowadays scientists often come across the mirror phenotype of the already described microdeletion (microduplication) syndromes. The presence of the reciprocal microduplication (microdeletion), which afflicted a gene sensitive to gene dosage or other important region of the human genome, is discovered by a genomic analysis.

40|$|Mycobacterium ulcerans {{causes the}} devastating {{infectious}} skin disease Buruli ulcer {{and has a}} monomorphic population structure. The resolution of conventional genetic fingerprinting methods is therefore not sufficient for micro-epidemiological studies aiming to characterize transmission pathways. In a previous <b>comparative</b> <b>genomic</b> <b>hybridisation</b> analysis with a microarray covering part of the M. ulcerans genome, we have found insertion sequence-associated extensive insertional-deletional sequence polymorphisms among M. ulcerans isolates of diverse geographic origin that allowed distinguishing between strains coming from different continents.
