5|$|Giselle was revived in 1863 {{with new}} costumes by Lormier's assistant, Alfred Albert. Albert's costumes {{are closer to}} those of modern {{productions}} than those of Lormier, and were in use at the opera until 1868. The ballet was revived again in 1924 with scenery and costumes by Alexandre Benois. He wanted to revive the costumes of the original production but dropped the idea, believing the critics would <b>charge</b> <b>him</b> {{with a lack of}} imaginative creativity.|$|E
5|$|The first {{openly gay}} British footballer Justin Fashanu (1961–1998) spent his {{last night in}} Chariots Roman Spa. His suicide was due to press reports that the US {{authorities}} were planning to extradite him and <b>charge</b> <b>him</b> with sexual assault (there was in fact no warrant). His suicide note claimed that the sexual encounter had been consensual and that the youth contacted police only after Fashanu refused to pay him blackmail.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 17, while {{going through}} {{insurance}} papers in his parents' home, Rose learned of his biological father's existence, and he unofficially readopted his birth name. However, he referred to himself only as W. Rose, {{because he did not}} want to share a first name with his biological father. Following the discovery of his true family origins, Rose became the local juvenile delinquent in Lafayette; he was arrested more than 20 times on charges such as public intoxication and battery, and served jail terms up to three months. After Lafayette authorities threatened to <b>charge</b> <b>him</b> as a habitual criminal, Rose moved to Los Angeles, California, in December 1982. After moving to Los Angeles, he became so engrossed in his band AXL that his friends suggested he call himself Axl Rose; he legally changed his name to W. Axl Rose prior to signing his contract with Geffen Records in March 1986.|$|E
5|$|Knox's final {{encounter}} with Mary {{was prompted by}} an incident at Holyrood. While Mary was absent from Edinburgh on her summer progress in 1563, a crowd forced its way into her private chapel as Mass was being celebrated. During the altercation, the priest's life was threatened. As a result, two of the ringleaders, burgesses of Edinburgh, were scheduled for trial on 24 October 1563. In order to defend these men, Knox sent out letters calling the nobles to convene. Mary obtained one of these letters and asked her advisors if {{this was not a}} treasonable act. Stewart and Maitland, wanting to keep good relations with both the Kirk and the Queen, asked Knox to admit he was wrong and to settle the matter quietly. Knox refused and he defended himself in front of Mary and the Privy Council. He argued that he had called a legal, not an illegal, assembly as part of his duties as a minister of the Kirk. After he left, the councillors voted not to <b>charge</b> <b>him</b> with treason.|$|E

As is standard practice in the UDA, Adair vacated his position as Brigadier upon entering prison, with his friend Winkie Dodds succeeding him.|$|E
25|$|Bach-Zelewski left {{prison in}} 1949. In 1951, Bach-Zelewski {{claimed that he}} helped Hermann Göring commit suicide in 1946.

The authorities never verified Bach-Zelewski's claim, however, and did not <b>charge</b> <b>him</b> with aiding Göring's death. Most modern historians dismiss Bach-Zelewski's claim and agree that a U.S. Army contact within the Palace of Justice's prison at Nuremberg most likely aided Göring in his suicide.|$|E
