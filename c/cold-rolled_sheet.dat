5000|$|Modern cans are {{generally}} produced through a mechanical cold forming process {{that starts with}} punching a flat blank from very stiff <b>cold-rolled</b> <b>sheet.</b> This sheet is typically alloy 3104-H19 or 3004-H19, which is aluminum with about 1% manganese and 1% magnesium to give it strength and formability.

The bottom of the can is also shaped at this time. The malleable metal deforms {{into the shape of}} an open-top can.

The texture of the phase in the hot-rolled and annealed sheet had a strong -fiber texture, and this was stable even in <b>cold-rolled</b> and annealed <b>sheet.</b> However, {{in the case of a}} coarse grain caused by high-temperature annealing prior to cold rolling, the -fiber texture and colony with h 100 i = = ND orientation in the phase were reduced in <b>cold-rolled</b> and annealed <b>sheet.</b> This control of the -fiber texture in the phase in <b>cold-rolled</b> and annealed <b>sheet</b> improved the elongation, r-value, and ridging characteristics.

Al 2 O 3 particles are exposed during rolling, resulting in scratches and rough spots on <b>cold-rolled</b> <b>sheet.</b> The places where Al 2 O 3 inclusions enrich are easy to form surface micro-cracks.

The microstructure after hot rolling was bainite. The hot-rolled sheet was cold rolled to a thickness of 1  mm (reduction: 67  %). Optical micrographs of the hot-rolled and <b>cold-rolled</b> <b>sheets</b> were included in our previous article (Ogawa et al. 2010).

50|$|<b>Cold-rolled</b> <b>sheets</b> and strips come {{in various}} conditions: full-hard, half-hard, quarter-hard, and skin-rolled. Full-hard rolling reduces the {{thickness}} by 50%, {{while the others}} involve less of a reduction. Skin-rolling, {{also known as a}} skin-pass, involves the least amount of reduction: 0.5-1%. It is used to produce a smooth surface, a uniform thickness, and reduce the yield point phenomenon (by preventing Lüders bands from forming in later processing). It locks dislocations at the surface and thereby reduces the possibility of formation of Lüders bands. To avoid the formation of Lüders bands it is necessary to create substantial density of unpinned dislocations in ferrite matrix. It is also used to break up the spangles in galvanized steel. Skin-rolled stock is usually used in subsequent cold-working processes where good ductility is required.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview on obtaining low-carbon ultra-fine grained dual-phase steels through rapid intercritical annealing of <b>cold-rolled</b> <b>sheet</b> as improved materials for automotive applications. A laboratory processing route was designed that involves cold-rolling of a tempered martensite structure followed by a second tempering step to produce a fine grained aggregate of ferrite and carbides as the initial microstructure for rapid intercritical annealing. The intercritical annealing step was performed with heating and cooling rates of at least 100 °C/s and a holding time of 30 s. The intercritical temperature was selected to result in 20 - 35 % martensite in the final microstructures for C-Mn steels with carbon contents of 0. 06, 0. 12 and 0. 17 wt%, respectively. The proposed processing routes produced an ultra-fine grained ferrite-martensite structure withgrain sizes of approximately 1 ?m for all three steels. The tensile strength of these ultra-fine grained dualphase steels can be increased by up to 200 MPa as compared to coarse-grained dual-phase steels while maintaining uniform elongation values. The rather narrow processing window necessary to obtain these properties was evaluated by determining the effect of intercritical annealing conditions on microstructure evolution. Further, the experimental results were confirmed with phase field simulations of austenite formation indicating that rapid heat treatment cycles are essential to obtain fine grained intercritical austenite that leads to martensite islands with sizes of 1 ?m and below in the final microstructure...|$|E
