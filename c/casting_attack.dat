5000|$|The {{genius of}} the [...] "High School Musical" [...] machine becomes more {{apparent}} in its third installment—the first for the big screen. As seniors Troy (Zac Efron), Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) and Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) graduate from fictitious East High, they also leave the franchise and attempt to repackage themselves as mainstream pop stars with wider demographic appeal. Meanwhile, new faces like British exchange student Tiara (Jemma McKenzie-Brown) start to sing and dance {{their way into the}} hearts of the faithful. The infinitely refreshable series has its musical formula down: Take [...] "Rent"-style modern Broadway, add a kid-friendly dance beat with allusions to current pop, remove all hints of angst or lust. The result is another utopian vision of American teens, made for preteens. But the <b>cast</b> <b>attacks</b> the material with such sell-it-to-the-back-row spunk that anyone who likes a good show can't help but {{get a kick out of}} it. Billboard Magazine ...|$|R

5000|$|Most {{actions in}} the game cost [...] "mana". This {{includes}} summoning creatures, <b>casting</b> spells, <b>attacking,</b> and rotating a friendly creature that is in play. At {{the beginning of each}} player's turn, they gain 2 points of mana. If a creature is killed, it is moved to the discard pile and its owner gains 1 point of mana. There are other cards in the game that allow a player to gain mana in various ways.|$|R
50|$|During combat mode, each {{character}} gets {{a certain amount}} of action points, which are spent moving, <b>attacking,</b> <b>casting</b> spells, and using items. Unless enhanced or affected, the player and their allies in the Party Roster will start with 8 action points.|$|R
50|$|Combat {{spirits are}} {{physical}} spirits that are essentially your army.

Some combat units have increased movement range, can use ranged <b>attacks,</b> <b>cast</b> spells or use even special abilities.|$|R
50|$|As {{with most}} {{strategy}} RPGs, each battlefield is divided {{up into a}} grid where player characters and enemies take turns moving, <b>attacking,</b> <b>casting</b> magic and using items. Player characters gain experience by battling enemies, and may choose, once they reach level 10, to upgrade their class into a more powerful one.|$|R
50|$|Battles {{take place}} on a square grid, and each unit {{occupies}} a single square. Battles are turn-based.

50|$|Several {{hazardous}} dungeons {{stand in}} the path of victory, as well as a selection of optional dungeons which can be played in any order the player chooses.

5|$|The {{decision}} {{to hire an}} A-list ensemble <b>cast</b> for Mars <b>Attacks!</b> parallels the strategy Irwin Allen used for his disaster films, notably The Poseidon Adventure (1972) and The Towering Inferno (1974).

50|$|Shining Force is a turn-based {{tactical}} role-playing game. Battles {{take place}} in square grids, and each unit occupies one square. Each unit can move up to a fixed amount of squares along the battlefield, determined by its Move statistic. Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit can also perform one action: <b>attack,</b> <b>cast</b> a spell, use an item, or search the area. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, do not count as actions. The order of turns {{is determined by the}} unit's agility score and a random seed.|$|R

[...] Giuliani has collected $11.4 million from speaking fees {{in a single year}} (with increased demand after the attacks). Before September 11, Giuliani's assets were estimated to be somewhat less than $2 million, but his net worth could now be as high as 30 times that amount. He has made most of his money since leaving office.|$|R
50|$|The {{games are}} {{played in a}} 45° axonometric view and feature turn-based combat. The lands are split up into small areas, which can be {{traveled}} through using a world map.

At the beginning of the game, the player chooses a type of Shaper to be. The three types are Shapers, Guardians, and Agents. When the player gains a level, he or she gains an amount of skill points, which can be spent on improving {{one or more of the}} character's abilities.|$|R

50|$|Gameplay is simple. The player navigates {{through a}} crude {{representation}} of a dungeon, presented in split-screen format which allows the player to simultaneously view the dungeon from a first-person perspective and a simple map of the current level showing the party's location. Encounters with monsters occur randomly (and occasionally in specific locations), during which the map is replaced by gauges representing the creatures' health. During fights the player controls the characters' actions to <b>attack,</b> <b>cast</b> magic spells, or flee. The entire game takes place in an underground dungeon composed of 16 levels, with the serpent at the end.|$|R

The battle system uses tiles to determine how far each character can move, and each action (be it <b>attack,</b> <b>cast</b> a spell, or any number of special abilities) is activated through an onscreen menu." ...|$|R
40|$|Most of the cyber attacks use spoofed IP packets to <b>cast</b> an <b>attack.</b> The {{stateless}} {{nature of}} IP makes {{it nearly impossible}} to identify the true source(s) of these attacks. With the help of IP traceback techniques, we try to identifying the true source of an IP datagram in Internet. While many IP traceback techniques have been proposed, {{but most of the}} previous studies focus and offer solutions for DDoS attacks done on IPv 4 environment. IPv 4 and IPv 6 Networks differ greatly from each other, for instance, absence of the Option field in basic IPv 6 header. Thus, the mechanisms of IP Traceback for IPv 4 networks may not apply to IPv 6 networks. In this paper, we extend our previous work i. e. PPM for IPv 6 and remove its drawback by using Policy Based IP Traceback (PBIT) mechanism. We also discuss problems related to previously proposed IPv 4 traceback schemes and practical subtleties in implementing traceback techniques for IPv 6 networks. * Keywords: IPv 6 Traceback, Policy-based Management, PBIT 1...|$|R
50|$|On December 27 and 28, the Operation <b>Cast</b> Lead <b>attack</b> on Gaza was launched, killing over 280 and {{injuring}} 600 {{in its first}} two days, according to Palestinian officials. Most were Hamas police and security officers, though many civilians also died. According to Israel, militant training camps, rocket-manufacturing facilities and weapons warehouses that had been pre-identified were hit, and later they attacked rocket and mortar squads who fired around 180 rockets and mortars at Israeli communities. Chief of Gaza police force Tawfiq Jabber, head of the General Security Service Salah Abu Shrakh, senior religious authority and security officer Nizar Rayyan, and Interior Minister Said Seyam were among those killed during the fighting. Although Israel sent out thousands of cell-phone messages urging residents of Gaza to leave houses where weapons may be stored, {{in an attempt to}} minimise civilian casualties, some residents complained there was nowhere to go because many neighborhoods had received the same message. Israeli bombs landed close to civilian structures such as schools, and some alleged that Israel was deliberately targeting Palestinian civilians.|$|R
5000|$|To {{compensate}} for Nakoruru's short weapon range, players {{must rely on}} her speed to punish their opponents' mistakes. Nakoruru's strengths lie in her air supremacy (including aerial throws) and ability to jump around {{the sides of the}} screen. She can also recover from her moves a little quicker than other characters, making it easier for her to hit-and-run during fights. To balance her out {{with the rest of the}} <b>cast,</b> her <b>attack</b> strength is slightly weaker than most fighters. Her move set usually incorporates slightly longer ranged attacks that project her or her animal companions to her foes so her attack range is not limited to her sword. Since Samurai Shodown II, she can also reflect projectiles with the move [...] "Kamui Ryusei". Prior to Samurai Shodown V Special, Nakoruru and Rimururu have been the series' two characters notable for being immune to the Fatality-like bloody killing moves. In Samurai Shodown: Edge of Destiny , Mamahaha does not appear in fights except in special moves. Her moves' names are written in the Ainu language.|$|R

Similar to both Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tenseis battle systems, party members and enemies each have strengths and weaknesses against certain types of physical attacks, such as swords and arrows, and elemental attacks, such as fire and ice. The affinities of each party member change depending on the weapon they have equipped.|$|R

He claimed that his tactics were simply to wear down LeMond's (and his) opponents and that he ultimately knew that LeMond would be the winner because of time losses earlier in the race.

5000|$|The core game {{follows the}} {{standard}} {{rules of the}} collectible card game Magic: The Gathering, first released in 1993; each player has {{a deck of cards}} consisting of lands and spells. Lands are used to generate [...] "mana", the resource needed to cast spells. Mana comes in five colors, and cards may require colored or generic (mana of any color) to be cast. Spells come in many varieties, from sorceries and instants which have one-time effects, to summoned creatures which can attack and defend from opponents. Players alternate turns playing land cards, <b>casting</b> spells, and <b>attacking</b> opponents until all but one player's life total is reduced to 0.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Gold Box Engine" [...] had {{two main}} game play modes. Outside of {{character}} creation, game play {{took place in}} a screen that displayed text interactions, the names and current status of your party of characters, and a window which displayed images of geography, and large or small pictures of characters or events. When combat occurred, which was often in these games, you switched to a full screen combat mode, in which player character icons could move about to <b>cast</b> spells or <b>attack</b> icons representing the enemies. All the games typically involved long dungeon crawls, and were heavier on combat than on role-playing.|$|R
