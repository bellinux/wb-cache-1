5|$|Autoimmune {{disorders}} <b>can</b> <b>often</b> {{be traced}} to antibodies that bind the body's own epitopes; many can be detected through blood tests. Antibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens in immune mediated hemolytic anemia are detected with the Coombs test. The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in blood transfusion preparation and also for antibody screening in antenatal women.|$|E

5|$|Bacteria like archaea are prokaryotic – unicelluar, {{and having}} no cell nucleus or other membrane-bound organelle. Bacteria are microscopic, {{with a few}} {{extremely}} rare exceptions, such as Thiomargarita namibiensis. Bacteria function and reproduce as individual cells, but they <b>can</b> <b>often</b> aggregate in multicellular colonies. Some species such as myxobacteria can aggregate into complex swarming structures, operating as multicellular groups {{as part of their}} life cycle, or form clusters in bacterial colonies such as E.coli.|$|E
5|$|Caprella mutica inhabit shallow {{protected}} marine {{bodies of}} water. They <b>can</b> <b>often</b> {{be found in}} dense colonies attached to submerged artificial structures, marine macroalgae, and other organisms. They are primarily omnivorous detritivores, but can adapt to other feeding methods depending on food availability. They are preyed upon by fish, crabs, and several other predators.|$|E
5|$|Gastrointestinal upset {{can cause}} severe discomfort; {{it is most}} common when {{metformin}} is first administered, or when the dose is increased. The discomfort <b>can</b> <b>often</b> be avoided by beginning at a low dose (1.0 to 1.7grams per day) and increasing the dose gradually but even with low doses 5% of people {{may be unable to}} tolerate metformin. Use of slow- or extended-release preparations may improve tolerability.|$|E

50|$|Marabi {{was played}} on pianos with accompaniment from pebble-filled <b>cans,</b> <b>often</b> in shebeens, establishments that {{illegally}} served alcohol to blacks. By the 1930s, however, marabi had incorporated new instruments, guitars, concertinas and banjos, and new styles of marabi had sprung up. Among these were a marabi/swing fusion called African jazz and jive, a generic term for any popular marabi style of music.|$|R

5|$|House mice {{use both}} audible and {{ultrasonic}} {{calls in a}} variety of contexts. Audible vocalizations <b>can</b> <b>often</b> be heard during agonistic or aggressive encounters, whereas ultrasound is used in sexual communication and also by pups when they have fallen out of the nest.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rajah usually {{grows in}} open, grassy clearings on old land slips and flat ridge tops, {{particularly}} {{in areas of}} seeping ground water, where the soil is loose and permanently moist. Although these sites can receive very high rainfall, excess water drains away quickly, preventing the soil from becoming waterlogged. N. rajah <b>can</b> <b>often</b> be found growing in grassy undergrowth, especially among sedges.|$|E
5|$|Pennies {{and other}} small coins are {{sometimes}} ingested by dogs, requiring veterinary removal of the foreign objects. The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity, commonly fatal in dogs through severe hemolytic anemia and liver or kidney damage; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms. Zinc is highly toxic in parrots and poisoning <b>can</b> <b>often</b> be fatal. The consumption of fruit juices stored in galvanized cans has resulted in mass parrot poisonings with zinc.|$|E

5|$|Related by {{periodic}} trends, rhenium has {{a similar}} chemistry to that of technetium; work done to label rhenium onto target compounds <b>can</b> <b>often</b> be translated to technetium. This is useful for radiopharmacy, where {{it is difficult to}} work with technetium – especially the 99m isotope used in medicine – due to its expense and short half-life.|$|E
5|$|Suillus americanus is {{a common}} species, and is found growing solitarily or in {{clusters}} on the ground throughout northeastern North America, north to Canada, where it typically fruits {{in the late summer}} and autumn.

5|$|The {{researches}} of John Harvey {{have uncovered}} {{the names of}} many English medieval architects, and by tracing stylistic characteristics, it has sometimes proved possible to track their careers from one building to another.

5|$|Trained {{cockatoos}} {{are sometimes}} seen in bird shows in zoos. They are generally less motivated by food than other birds; some may more respond to petting or praise than food. Cockatoos <b>can</b> <b>often</b> {{be taught to}} wear a parrot harness, enabling their owners to take them outdoors.
