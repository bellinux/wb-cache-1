The operating principle on the charger {{is explained by}} an equivalent circuit. Additionally, we analyze the charging characteristic in one discontinuous conduction mode and three continuous conduction modes. The analysis shows that the resonant current per phase is {{two thirds of the}} 3 -phase charger’s average charging current and one third of the single-phase charger’s average charging current with the same capacity.

50|$|Many voltage-controlled {{oscillators}} {{for electronic}} music {{are based on}} a <b>capacitor</b> <b>charging</b> linearly in an op-amp integrator configuration. When the capacitor charge reaches a certain level, a comparator generates a reset pulse, which discharges the capacitor and the cycle begins again. This produces a rising ramp (or sawtooth) waveform, and this type of oscillator core is known as a ramp core.|$|E

Several factors contribute to this including, but not limited to, switching frequency, output capacitance, inductor, load and any current limiting features of the control circuitry.

50|$|However, if {{one or both}} of the {{capacitor}} plates is a semiconductor, then {{galvani potential}} is not necessarily the only important contribution to capacitance. As the <b>capacitor</b> <b>charge</b> increases, the negative plate fills up with electrons, which occupy higher-energy states in the band structure, while the positive plate loses electrons, leaving behind electrons with lower-energy states in the band structure. Therefore, as the <b>capacitor</b> <b>charges</b> or discharges, the voltage changes at a different rate than the galvani potential difference.|$|R
50|$|Unlike flashbulbs, the {{intensity}} of an electronic flash can be adjusted on some units. To do this, smaller flash units typically vary the capacitor discharge time, whereas larger (e.g., higher power, studio) units typically vary the <b>capacitor</b> <b>charge.</b> Color temperature can change {{as a result of}} varying the <b>capacitor</b> <b>charge,</b> thus making color corrections necessary. Due to advances in semiconductor technology, some studio units can now control intensity by varying the discharge time and thereby provide consistent color temperature.|$|R

50|$|For a given <b>capacitor</b> <b>charging</b> current, the {{amplitude}} of the output waveform will decrease linearly with frequency. In musical terms, {{this means a}} waveform an octave higher in pitch is of half the amplitude. In order to produce a constant amplitude over {{the full range of}} the oscillator, some compensation scheme must be employed. This is often done by controlling the charging current from the same microprocessor that controls the counter reset value.|$|E
50|$|Because turn-ons {{are caused}} by {{internal}} capacitive currents flowing into the gate {{as a consequence of}} a high dv/dt, (i.e., rapid voltage change) a gate resistor or capacitor (or both in parallel) may be connected between the gate and MT1 to provide a low-impedance path to MT1 and further prevent false triggering. This, however, increases the required trigger current or adds latency due to <b>capacitor</b> <b>charging.</b> On the other hand, a resistor between the gate and MT1 helps draw leakage currents out of the device, thus improving the performance of the TRIAC at high temperature, where the maximum allowed dv/dt is lower. Values of resistors less than 1kΩ and capacitors of 100nF are generally suitable for this purpose, although the fine-tuning should be done on the particular device model.|$|E
50|$|Delay boxes began {{appearing}} in drag race {{cars in the}} 1980s. The early units were timers in a sheet metal box with an analog potentiometer and lock nut to establish a setpoint with no readout or feedback to the driver. These early units used a resistor / <b>capacitor</b> <b>charging</b> scheme to trigger a unijunction transistor to release an electromechanical relay. Such drag racing delay timers are very crude by today's standards. Nolen (IKE) Hamma is credited with introducing such early devices to drag racing. (currently DBA as Digital Delay, INC.) Ike Hamma is deceased. His family is assigned a patent for a type of delay timer, his son Charlie Hamma is the current president of Digital Delay Inc., a manufacturer of drag racing timers. Other entities contributed to delay box technology and also have Intellectual Property. Some of these other entities have delay box patents (Reid and Furrow), some entities did not pursue patents for their inventions even though their inventions may have predated those of known patent holders.|$|E

A method of data acquisition was devised that uses a <b>capacitor</b> <b>charge</b> technique to obtain the V-I characteristic and a computerized data system to display, record and process the data. The <b>capacitor</b> <b>charge</b> technique uses an array shorting transistor and a capacitor bank to sweep the array operating voltage and current from short circuit to open circuit in a specified time (approximately 125 ms).

50|$|Inrush {{currents}} into capacitive {{components are}} a key concern in power-up stress to components. When DC input power is applied to a capacitive load, the step response of the voltage input will cause the input capacitor to charge. The <b>capacitor</b> <b>charging</b> starts with an inrush current and ends with an exponential decay down to the steady state condition. When {{the magnitude of the}} inrush peak is very large compared to the maximum rating of the components, then component stress is to be expected. The current into a capacitor is known to be : the peak inrush current will depend upon the capacitance C and the rate of change of the voltage (dV/dT). The inrush current will increase as the capacitance value increases, and the inrush current will increase as the voltage of the power source increases. This second parameter is of primary concern in high voltage power distribution systems. By their nature, high voltage power sources will deliver high voltage into the distribution system. Capacitive loads will then be subject to high inrush currents upon power-up. The stress to the components must be understood and minimized.|$|E
