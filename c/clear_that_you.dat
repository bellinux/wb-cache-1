2500|$|Japanese, Italian and Nazi {{aggression}} that precipitated World War II {{often is}} cited as an argument against pacifism. If these forces {{had not been}} challenged and defeated militarily, the argument goes, many more people would have died under their oppressive rule. Adolf Hitler told the British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax in 1937 that the British should [...] "shoot Gandhi, and if this doesn't suffice to reduce them to submission, shoot a dozen leading members of the Congress, and if that doesn't suffice shoot 200, and so on, as you make it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> mean business." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 782, Zhu Tao, {{angry that}} he was not given part of Chengde Circuit (成德, {{headquartered}} in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) after he, pursuant to imperial orders, had participated in the campaign that led to the death of Li Weiyue and had, briefly, returned Chengde to imperial control, rebelled against Emperor Dezong. [...] He went secret letters to Zhu Ci asking Zhu Ci to rebel as well. [...] The letters, however, were intercepted by imperial forces and never reached Zhu Ci. [...] Emperor Dezong, upon reviewing the letters, recalled Zhu Ci to Chang'an and showed him the letters. [...] Zhu, in fear, begged forgiveness. [...] Emperor Dezong responded, [...] "You are thousands of li away from each other, and it is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> did not join his plot. [...] This is no sin of yours." [...] Despite this assurance, however, Emperor Dezong, while permitting Zhu to retain all of his titles, did not permit him to return to Fengxiang. [...] Instead, he kept Zhu at Chang'an, although he gave him a great mansion, fields, and treasures, hoping to placate him.|$|E

You observe that you have some {{splashes}} on the left sleeve and shoulder of your coat. Had you sat in the centre of a hansom you would probably have had no splashes, {{and if you had}} they would certainly have been symmetrical. Therefore it is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> sat at the side. Therefore it is equally <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had a companion." ...|$|E
