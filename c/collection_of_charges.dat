40|$|International audienceIonization detectors, {{based on}} the drift and <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> in high purity Germanium {{crystals}} (HP-Ge), are commonly used for gamma and particle detection. In the field of very low temperature detectors, several major experiments, like EDELWEISS or CDMS, are using such devices combined with a simultaneous measurement of the detector heat pulses, to search for dark matter in the universe. The leakage current between the charge collecting electrodes of the detectors must be kept {{as low as possible}} to preserve performance in terms of high resolution and low threshold. We present results concerning the surface treatment of EDELWEISS HP-Ge crystals, aiming at the reduction of their leakage currents at temperatures below 4 K. Among the explored solutions, a post-process dry-etching using XeF (xenon difluoride) gives very promising and reproducible results. The modification of the Ge surface by this treatment and its effect on the low temperature leakage currents are discussed...|$|E

40|$|As California {{develops}} toll roads {{during the}} 1990 s and considers {{the use of}} congestion pricing to resolve freeway congestion, electronic toll collection technology will assume increasing importance. These electronic, computer-based systems permit nonstop <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> for highway use, without requiring costly toll booths. They also facilitate charging different prices {{at different times of}} day and for different segments of a highway—qualities necessary for congestion pricing. It would be desirable for drivers {{to be able to use}} a single electronic “tag ” statewide, rather than having to obtain separate tags for each tolled facility. A 1990 state law required the California Department of Transportation to develop a statewide technical specification for electronic toll collection systems. This statewide specification was issued in July 1992. This paper reviews the technical and policy (economic, legal, and social) implications of electronic toll collection systems. It finds that the technology is developing rapidly, with new approaches being developed by both U. S. and European firms.
