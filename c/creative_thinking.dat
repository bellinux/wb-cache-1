25|$|Several {{different}} {{researchers have}} proposed methods {{of increasing the}} creativity of an individual. Such ideas range from the psychological-cognitive, such as Osborn-Parnes Creative Problem Solving Process, Synectics, science-based <b>creative</b> <b>thinking,</b> Purdue <b>Creative</b> <b>Thinking</b> Program, and Edward de Bono's lateral thinking; to the highly structured, such as TRIZ (the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving) and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving (developed by the Russian scientist Genrich Altshuller), and Computer-Aided morphological analysis.|$|E
25|$|One {{characteristic}} of creative people, {{as measured by}} some psychologists, is what is called divergent production. Divergent production {{is the ability of}} a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation. One way of measuring divergent production is by administering the Torrance Tests of <b>Creative</b> <b>Thinking.</b> The Torrance Tests of <b>Creative</b> <b>Thinking</b> assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions.|$|E

25|$|Promoting {{intrinsic}} motivation {{and problem solving}} are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative {{when they see a}} task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake. To promote <b>creative</b> <b>thinking,</b> educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.|$|E

25|$|There is some {{evidence}} suggesting that executive dysfunction may produce beneficial effects as well as maladaptive ones. Abraham et al. demonstrate that <b>creative</b> <b>thinking</b> in schizophrenia is mediated by executive dysfunction, and they establish a firm etiology for creativity in psychoticism, pinpointing a cognitive preference for broader top-down associative thinking versus goal-oriented thinking, which closely resembles aspects of ADHD. It is postulated that elements of psychosis are present in both ADHD and schizophrenia/schizotypy due to dopamine overlap.|$|E

In this model, {{there are}} 3 within-individual {{components}} needed for creativity – domain-relevant skills, creativity-relevant processes, and task motivation – and 1 component {{external to the}} individual: their surrounding social environment. Creativity requires a confluence of all components. High creativity will result when an individual is: intrinsically motivated, possesses both {{a high level of}} domain-relevant skills and has high skills in <b>creative</b> <b>thinking,</b> and is working in a highly creative environment.|$|E

25|$|Critics of the {{education}} system, including some parents, state that education in Singapore is too specialized, rigid, and elitist. Often, these criticisms state {{that there is little}} emphasis on <b>creative</b> <b>thinking.</b> Those defending the current education system point out that Singaporean students have regularly ranked near the top when competing in international science and mathematics competitions and assessments. Detractors, however, argue this is more an indication of the institution's use of rote learning to prepare for competition or examination than of students' critical thinking skills.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} is broadly organized into seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus, with each college and division defining its own admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy. The university also administers two satellite medical campuses, one in New York City {{and one in}} Education City, Qatar, and Cornell Tech, a graduate program that incorporates technology, business, and <b>creative</b> <b>thinking.</b> The program moved from Google's Chelsea Building in New York City to its permanent campus on Roosevelt Island in September 2017.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 65% of its 1,864 {{undergraduate}} students come from Kentucky, but members of its Spring 2014 entering class also hailed {{from more than}} 37 states and 15 countries. The university's faculty and curricula are equally broad-based. The growing range of its undergraduate and graduate programs – education, professional counseling, business, physician assistant studies, and Christian studies – also reflects the university's critical and <b>creative</b> <b>thinking</b> as it prepares students for lives of service and leadership. In all of these endeavors, the university continues its pursuit of excellence and vita abundantior.|$|E

40|$|Orientation: An {{important}} {{evaluation function}} is to determine whether <b>creative</b> and innovative <b>thinking</b> and problem-solving skills can be developed through training and to assess whether these skills, on their own, are sufficient to ignite innovation in organisations. Research purpose: The evaluation question that the present study aimed to address is whether employees in a corporate context, such as a financial services organisation, can develop <b>creative</b> and innovative <b>thinking</b> and problem-solving skills through an intervention such as a workshop. Motivation for the study: A financial services organisation commissioned the primary author of this article to design a workshop {{with the intent to}} develop the <b>creative</b> and innovative <b>thinking</b> and problem-solving skills of their employees in order to ignite innovation and competitiveness. Research design, approach and method: This study employed mainly qualitative research. Utilisation-focused evaluation (UFE) was employed and findings from the literature review, questionnaires, pen-and-paper tests and interviews were used. The unit of analysis was a niche business unit in a South African financial services organisation. Main findings: From this study’s point of view, the most critical finding related to the confirmation that individuals can acquire <b>creative</b> and innovative <b>thinking</b> and problemsolving skills. The acquisition of these skills, however, is not sufficient on its own to establish a culture supportive of creativity and sustainable innovation. Practical/managerial implications: The development of <b>creative</b> and innovative <b>thinking</b> and problem-solving skills of employees is not sufficient on its own to support sustainable innovation. Managers should consciously establish determinants on an organisational as well as an individual level to create an environment supportive of sustainable innovation. Contribution/value-add: The present study indicated how a workshop can assist individuals to develop <b>creative</b> and innovative <b>thinking</b> and problem-solving skills. The acquisition of these skills is not sufficient on its own to ignite sustainable innovation...|$|R

The Spirit was markedly improved and performed well, but AMC was unable to overcome perception that its products were outdated. Moreover, the Spirit AMX was introduced {{the same year as}} the similar but new Fox Platform Ford Mustang. The Spirit AMX cancelled after a brief two model years, with the similar Eagle SX/4, a sporty four-wheel-drive successor. The Spirit AMX was the last car to wear the AMX name and has achieved popularity with AMC enthusiasts.|$|E
