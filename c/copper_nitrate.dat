25|$|If metal nitrates are {{prepared}} from N2O4 in completely anhydrous conditions, {{a range of}} covalent metal nitrates can be formed with many transition metals. This is {{because there is a}} thermodynamic preference for the nitrate ion to bond covalently with such metals rather than form an ionic structure. Such compounds must be prepared in anhydrous conditions, since the nitrate ion is a much weaker ligand than water, and if water is present the simple hydrated nitrate will form. The anhydrous nitrates concerned are themselves covalent, and many, e.g. anhydrous <b>copper</b> <b>nitrate,</b> are volatile at room temperature. Anhydrous titanium nitrate sublimes in vacuum at only 40°C. Many of the anhydrous transition metal nitrates have striking colours. This branch of chemistry was developed by Clifford Addisson and Noramn Logan at Nottingham University in the UK during the 1960s and 1970s when highly efficient desiccants and dry boxes started to become available.|$|E

30|$|The {{ammonium}} form of beta {{zeolite catalyst}} was calcined at 550  °C for 4  h to get proton form beta zeolite catalysts (BZ). Next, <b>copper</b> (II) <b>nitrate</b> trihydrate and zirconium (IV) oxynitrate hydrate metals were impregnated into {{the structure of}} beta zeolite using a typical wet impregnation method (Güleç et al. 2016, 2017).

40|$|The {{influence}} of iron, <b>copper</b> and <b>nitrate</b> ions on free-radical processes in rats and the dependence between dose and effect of pro-oxidants were studied.

A maximal effect of iron on the concentration of conjugated dienes was observed in a dose equal to 0. 33 MPC, while <b>copper</b> and <b>nitrate</b> possess maximal activity in concentrations of 0. 5 MPCs.

50|$|Many reef {{aquarium}} keepers use {{reverse osmosis}} systems for their artificial mixture of seawater.
