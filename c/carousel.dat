5|$|Cedar Point {{used to have}} {{a fourth}} <b>carousel</b> located in Frontiertown, next to the Wave Swinger. It was known as the Frontier <b>Carousel</b> or William H. Dentzel 1921 <b>Carousel.</b> It opened at Cedar Point in 1972 when it was bought from a family in Lansing, Michigan. It was listed on the NRHP on November 8, 1990. After the 1994 season, the <b>carousel</b> closed and was moved to Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, where it {{operates}} under the name Antique <b>Carousel.</b> Its building is currently used for the HalloWeekends attraction, Eternity Infirmary.|$|E
5|$|The <b>carousel</b> was {{commissioned}} by William Hubbs, who had it installed in White City Amusement Park in 1917. Built on a Mangel-Illions mechanism, it used animals carved by the Dentzel <b>carousel</b> company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, sometime before 1900. The <b>carousel</b> was assembled by the William F. Mangels <b>carousel</b> company in 1917. It was probably not the first <b>carousel</b> in the park, as there are indications of a previous ride that came from Hartford, Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|The park is {{also home}} to a 19th-century <b>carousel</b> {{manufactured}} around 1895 by Gustav Dentzel of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Highland Park Dentzel <b>Carousel</b> has been in operation since 1909, is a National Historic Landmark, and is the world's only two-row stationary Dentzel menagerie in existence. Its house is the only remaining original <b>carousel</b> building built from a Dentzel blueprint. Around Town Carousels Abound is a public arts project of 62 <b>carousel</b> horses, representing the historic <b>carousel.</b> Sixty-two pieces have been sponsored by local businesses and citizens, and design of the horses was conceived and painted by local artists. They are placed throughout the city and county.|$|E

5|$|Broad Ripple Park <b>Carousel</b> is {{an antique}} <b>carousel</b> in The Children's Museum of Indianapolis. It was {{installed}} in 1917 at an amusement park near the White River in Indianapolis, Indiana, where it remained until the building housing it collapsed in 1956. The ride's mechanism was destroyed, but the animals were relatively unscathed and put into storage by the park's owners, the Indianapolis Department of Parks and Recreation. The animals were carved by the Dentzel <b>Carousel</b> Company some time before 1900 but were assembled by the William F. Mangels <b>carousel</b> company, which also supplied the engine powering the ride.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} engine propelling the <b>carousel</b> was a belt-driven mechanism, {{but after}} the initial restoration it was exchanged for a fluid drive provided by the Kissell Brothers Amusement Rides company of Cincinnati, Ohio, who suggested the platform for the <b>carousel</b> be improved. To provide crowd control, a pavilion was built over the <b>carousel</b> and a ticket booth was installed. Neither was based on any extant buildings, but each was a composite of several other structures. The animals are removed {{one at a time}} from the <b>carousel</b> for routine maintenance and refurbishment, which is carried out in the museum's own shops.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>carouseling</b> an IMU is {{simulated}} {{in order to}} improve the accuracy of MEMS IMUs. <b>Carouseling</b> consists of slewing the IMU through a pre-determined trajectory that is selected based on inherent properties that lead to improved performance. MEMS devices typically have far more uncertainty than standard inertial measurement devices, yet are considerably less massive and require less power, so implementing this <b>carouseling</b> scheme could make the use of these lightweight systems possible even in high-accuracy situations, such as gyrocompassing. In gyrocompassing, the most significant benefit provided by the <b>carouseling</b> scheme is the reduction in the error contribution of gyroscope bias, as this error is almost completely eliminated. Additionally, it was found that although implementing the <b>carouseling</b> scheme required the addition of error states to account for the size effect, in many cases these error states may not be necessary. Overall, the <b>carouseling</b> of the MEMS IMUs was shown to be effective in reducing azimuth error covariance significantly. by Benjamin Matthew Renkoski. Thesis (S. M.)

5|$|Nothing {{is known}} {{of the history of}} the animals before their {{installation}} in the 1917 <b>carousel</b> assembly. During the 1960s newspaper reports stated that it was believed that the animals had arrived in Indianapolis in 1917, imported from Germany by two brothers named Mangels, but later research revealed the animals were manufactured by the Dentzel <b>carousel</b> company. Also included in the installation were oil paintings on the canopy over the animals and mechanism.|$|E

5|$|The park {{district}} {{does not}} appear to have moved the <b>carousel</b> after taking over in 1945, as a 1955 newspaper article noted it was still in the same spot it had occupied for 38years. The <b>carousel</b> was again operated as a concession within the park, this time by the wife of Everett DuBois, the park superintendent. Like Hubbs, Mrs. DuBois operated the <b>carousel</b> for almost 10years. Although the district did not change the ride's location, it noted in 1955 that the equipment was showing its age. In 1955 the park district attempted to paint over the oil paintings on the canopy, which had deteriorated. The Indianapolis Art League objected, and volunteered to restore the original paintings rather than have them painted over with Disney characters.|$|E

40|$|<b>Carouseling</b> is an {{efficient}} method {{to mitigate the}} measurement errors of inertial sensors, particularly MEMS gyroscopes. In this article, the effect of <b>carouseling</b> on the most significant stochastic error processes of a MEMS gyroscope, i. e., additive bias, white noise, 1 /f noise, and rate random walk, is investigated. Variance propagation equations for these processes under averaging and <b>carouseling</b> are defined. Furthermore, a novel approach to generating 1 /f noise is presented. The experimental results show that <b>carouseling</b> reduces the contributions of additive bias, 1 /f noise, and rate random walk significantly in comparison with plain averaging, which can be utilized to improve the accuracy of dead reckoning systems.

5|$|The museum {{intended}} to keep {{a few of the}} animals and sell the others to finance its operations, but Mildred Compton returned from a visit to the 1973 National <b>Carousel</b> Roundtable convinced that it should instead restore all of them and recreate the working <b>carousel</b> in its planned new building. But no space had been allocated to allow the display of such a large exhibit, requiring the plans to be adjusted. Columns required in the original layout were removed to allow the carousel's installation on the fifth floor.|$|E

5|$|While {{plans were}} {{under way to}} secure funding for the {{restoration}} of the <b>carousel,</b> efforts were made to find some missing animals. By studying old photographs of the <b>carousel,</b> it was determined there had been three deer or stags which had not been found in the park district storage building. No one at the park district knew of their whereabouts, and some employees believed the animals had disintegrated. As well as the missing deer, two horses were missing. The museum contacted local newspapers, which published stories on the efforts to restore the <b>carousel.</b> The reports mentioned the missing animals, and that the museum was trying to locate them. An anonymous tip received in December 1973 revealed the deer were used in the annual Christmas Gift and Hobby Show, where they served as escorts for Santa Claus. Compton was able to secure the animals from the park district for the museum.|$|E
