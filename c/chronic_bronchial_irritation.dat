A {{study was}} carried out {{on the effect of}} sputum sol (obtained by rapid centrifugation of purulent sputum) from 20 patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchial</b> sepsis on the beating of human nasal cilia in vitro by a photometric technique. Thirteen sols caused significant (p less than 0. 001) ciliary slowing.

The ciliary slowing activity of sputum sols was associated with the isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p less than 0. 01).

40|$|Airway remodelling is a {{critical}} feature of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchial</b> diseases, characterised by aberrant repair of the epithelium and accumulation of fibroblasts, which contribute to extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition resulting in fixed bronchial obstruction. Recently, epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition (EMT) {{has been identified as}} a new source of fibroblasts that could contribute to the remodelling of the airways. This phenomenon consists of the loss of the epithelial phenotype by bronchial epithelial cells and the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype. These cells are then able to migrate and secrete ECM molecules. Herein, we review the different types of EMT. We will then focus on the signalling pathways that are involved, such as transforming growth factor-Î² and Wnt, as well as the more recently described Sonic Hedgehog pathway. Finally, we will highlight the implication of EMT in airway remodelling in specific <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchial</b> pathologies, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiolitis obliterans following lung transplantation.

The colonising microbial load of Haemophilus spp was reduced only temporarily (+++ to ++) after each intermittent course of antibiotic, but a sustained and greater reduction in the colonising microbial load of both Haemophilus spp (+++ to +) and antibiotic resistant P aeruginosa (+++ to +) was seen during both continuous treatments.

Our aim was to show that surgical treatment of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchial</b> asthma by unilateral resection of the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (ib-SLN) is an adequateand lasting remedial response. Patients and methodsIn a retrospective study, 41 (26 male and 15 female) patients with <b>bronchial</b> <b>chronic</b> asthma were treated surgically during the period between 2005 and 2013. It consisted of a unilateral resection of the ib-SLN under optical zoom, on patients placed in supinator position. 35 patients (24 male and 11 female) who were un-operated were included as a control. ResultsIn all patients, medication was reduced progressively. When the results were compared with the control group, it was seen that in 26 Â % of the patients, both forced expiratory volume (FEV) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) increased significantly (p[*]< 05) and only modestly in 53. 6 Â % of patients (FEV, p[*]< 05 and PEF, p[*]< 05). In the remaining 20 Â % of patients, these parameters remained however unchanged. Overall, in 80 Â % of patients unilateral resection of the ib-SLN gave satisfactory results because it shortened the intervals and duration of asthmatic attacks, rendering thereby a reduction in medication. ConclusionThis minimal-invasive method helped prevent/cure asphyxias in <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchial</b> asthma without affecting cough reflex,respiratory control and phonation and it helped patients avoid severe crisis. This approach is of interest for patients with severe and/or uncontrolled bronchial asthma in settings with limited access to drug treatment...|$|R

This paper focuses on the importance of environmental factors in the development of asthma, including allergens and respiratory infections.

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a {{dominant}} pathogen in infection in cystic fibrosis. This bacterium {{is thought to}} play a major role in the <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchial</b> infection-induced pathophysiology. Our data showed that whole formalin-fixed heat-killed P. aeruginosa was mitogenic for human lymphocytes and induced production of substantial amounts of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) in peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes in cultures. Significant amounts of TNF were produced at 10 (3) bacteria per 2 x 10 (5) mononuclear leukocytes. Treatment of P. aeruginosa with polymixin B did not affect its ability to stimulate TNF production, suggesting that bacterial lipopolysaccharide is not involved. P. aeruginosa, however, did not stimulate production of the T-cell lymphokine lymphotoxin (TNF beta). Exotoxin A, considered to be an important virulence factor produced by P. aeruginosa, did not stimulate either lymphoproliferation or production of TNF. In fact, this toxin, at nontoxic concentrations, was found to depress lymphoproliferation induced by phytohemagglutinin and Staphylococcus aureus and decreased production of TNF, lymphotoxin, and gamma interferon in either lymphocytes or macrophages. This toxin similarly inhibited the production of interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) and IL- 1 alpha, but for the inhibition of the latter, 25 -fold-less toxin was required than for inhibition of the former. Inhibition of production of TNF was as sensitive as the IL- 1 alpha to exotoxin A. The effects of exotoxin A on lymphoproliferation and cytokine production could be neutralized by the addition of anti-exotoxin A antibodies. These results suggest that two mechanisms by which P. aeruginosa could contribute to the <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchial</b> infection-induced pathophysiology are the nonspecific stimulation of TNF and IL- 1 and the release of exotoxin A, a toxin which depresses immune responses...|$|R

40|$|Bronchial asthma is {{a common}} disease and an {{important}} cause of morbidity among both children and adults. Tobacco smoking, both active and passive i. e., exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) has got important effects on asthma. Smoking by adults causes <b>bronchial</b> <b>irritation</b> and precipitates acute episodes. It also increases bronchial responsiveness and causes airway sensitization to several occupational allergens. Smoking may also increase the disease severity. Continued smoking by adult asthmatics is the likely cause of irreversibility of airway obstruction and development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. ETS exposure affects asthma in a similar fashion. Parental smoking is commonly associated with increased asthma symptoms, respiratory infections, acute episodes and frequent hospitalization of children. Bronchial responsiveness and airway sensitization may also increase. Childhood exposure to smoking is also considered as {{a risk factor for}} the development of asthma. Similarly, in utero exposure to maternal smoking may be independently responsible for early onset asthma.

40|$|Background: Bronchiectasis is {{accompanied}} by <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchial</b> infection that may drive disease progression. However, the evidence base for antibiotic therapy is limited. DNA based methods offer better identification and quantification of microbial constituents of sputum than standard clinical culture and may help inform patient management strategies. Our study objective {{was to determine the}} longitudinal variability of the non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis microbiome in sputum with respect to clinical variables. Eighty-five patients with non-CF bronchiectasis and daily sputum production were recruited from outpatient clinics and followed for six months. Monthly sputum samples and clinical measurements were taken, together with additional samples during exacerbations. 16 S rRNA gene sequencing of the sputum microbiota was successful for 381 samples from 76 patients and analysed in conjunction with clinical data. Results: Microbial communities were highly individual in composition and stability, usually with limited diversity and often containing multiple pathogens. When compared to DNA sequencing, microbial culture had restricted sensitivity in identifying common pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis. With some exceptions, community characteristics showed poor correlations with clinical features including underlying disease, antibiotic use and exacerbations, with the subject showing the strongest association with community structure. When present, the pathogens mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae may also shape the structure {{of the rest of the}} microbial community. Conclusions: The use of microbial community analysis of sputum added to information from microbial culture. A simple model of exacerbations driven by bacterial overgrowth was not supported, suggesting a need for revision of principles for antibiotic therapy. In individual patients, the management of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchial</b> infection may be improved by therapy specific to their microbiome, taking into account pathogen load, community stability, and acute and chronic community responses to antibiotics...|$|R
