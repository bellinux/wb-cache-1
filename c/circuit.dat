40|$|Although many {{of works}} {{have been done}} in multivalued quantum logic synthesis, the {{question}} whether multivalued quantum <b>circuits</b> are more efficient than the conventional binary quantum <b>circuits</b> is still open. In this article we devote to the optimization of generic multivalued quantum <b>circuits.</b> The multivalued quantum Shannon decompositions (QSD) are improved so that the <b>circuits</b> obtained are asymptotically optimal for all dimensionality d. The syntheses of uniformly multifold controlled R_y rotations are also optimized to make the <b>circuits</b> further simplified. Moreover, the theoretical lower bound of complexity for multivalued quantum <b>circuits</b> is investigated, and a quantity known as efficiency index is proposed to evaluate the efficiency of synthesis of various quantum <b>circuits.</b> The algorithm for qudit <b>circuits</b> given here is an efficient synthesis routine which produces best known results for all dimensionality d, and for both cases the number of qudit n is small and that is asymptotic.
