The most significant water resources are the antrophogenic lakes called ”tăuri” which represent elements of great originality created for mining purposes. The first man-made lakes were created in order to activate the stamping mills used to grind the auriferous ores and occurred in this area since ancient times. These lakes have had an fundamental role during the millenary mining exploitation {{until the middle of}} 20 th century, after which they had lost their significance during the industrial process, {{as a consequence of the}} 1948 nationalization. Previous research identified traces of a big number of lakes, out of which there are active only 9 in the present. Although these lakes play no role in modern mining, they have a high cultural value which can be capitalized through tourism activities. The mentioned area, due to its altitude, is also appropriate for practising mountain <b>climatic</b> <b>therapy.</b> Given the fact that water and climate resources inherently have a significant role when concerning outdoor activities, Roşia Montană-Abrud area is suitable for recreational nautical tourism, winter sports and mountain cure, but one has to consider that hidro-climatic resources are also important for rural tourism, agritourism, ecotourism etc., for which reason it is imperative to be provided adequate tourism planning and tourism promotion in order to capitalize them properly...|$|E
40|$|Atopic eczema is a hereditarydiseaseof chronicorchronic-relapsing nature characterised by its {{clinical}} picture changing morphologically with {{the age of}} the patient as well as the acuteness of skin manifestations. The manifestations in adolescents and adults tend to persist for a longer period oftime. The remissionof the conditionoccursafterthe 30 thyearoflifeof the patients and diseaserelapsesoccuratprolongedintervals. The most significant manifestation of the disease is severe itching secondarily aggravating the present clinical changes. The therapy of an adult patient suffering from atopic dermatitis is highly specific and ought not to be unilateral and focused on the treatment of single symptoms. It is necessary to follow a complex approach to the problems of the patients and respect their home and working environment as well as their mental state. It is possible to divide the therapy into three basic groups: (1) Basic therapeutic guidelines (elimination of trigger factors, indifferent therapy with emollients, topical antimicrobial and antifungal therapy, diet, treatment ofotherdisorders), (2) Recommended therapy (topical -with antihistami-nics, topical corticoids, poultices, baths, dyes, other topically used preparations, skin cleansing, systemic - antihistaminics, antibiotics, cyclo-sporine A, steroids, phototherapy, photochemotherapy, hospitalisation in daily dermatological care centres, treatment of complications - infec-tions caused by viruses, bacterias, fungi as well as dishidrosis, eczema manifestations, psychotherapy, <b>climatic</b> <b>therapy),</b> (3) Alternative and experimental therapy (essentialfattyacids, Chinese herby, allergen desensitisation, interferon gammaglobuline, thymeextracts, localgammaglo-buline, phosphodiesterase inhibitors) and (4) the group dealing with therapy news: tacrolimus, pimecrolimus. Afterhavingmanagedtotreatthe acute manifestations, it is inevitable to treat the patient continuously which results in the prolongation of remission periods. The patient ought to be capable of mastering the guidelines for integrated skin therapy. What also is of extreme importance is the appropriate working environment of atopic patients (clean environment with no risk of allergisation) and the patient ought to be made acquainted with this fact as well. An erudite dermatologist ought to have sufficient information on available dermatocosmetic preparations and recommend these to the patient as supple-mentary skin care products...|$|E
