Some initiatives to secure such benefits and enhance trust in staff are proposed. ...|$|R

50|$|While the {{presence}} of undeclared meat was not a health issue, the scandal revealed a major breakdown in the traceability of the food supply chain, and the risk that harmful ingredients could have been included as well.

The scandal has since spread to 13 other European <b>countries,</b> <b>and</b> European <b>authorities</b> have decided to find an EU-wide solution.

5000|$|However, some right-wing {{organizations}} and their members often caused violent activities {{to prevent this}} transition. Mass media refrained from critical speech about the Emperor and the emperor system {{for fear of being}} attacked by right-wing organizations, {{and this is one of}} reasons for the beginning of the mass media's self-regulation. There is no evidence of self-regulation rules or standards for self-regulation regarding the Emperor in the print media; however, there is in the broadcast media, for example, the Japan Commercial Broadcasters Association (JBA) Standards has a section saying [...] "(broadcast media) do not broadcast in an attempt to harm our <b>country</b> <b>and</b> our <b>country’s</b> <b>authority</b> <b>and</b> as a symbol of country, Emperor is a subject to be included as the country’s authority."
