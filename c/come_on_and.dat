500|$|Cher's {{music plays}} {{a large role}} in [...] "The Post-Modern Prometheus", Chris Carter having written the episode after {{spending}} a summer listening to Cher records and developing a fixation on the singer. Carter knew that Cher's half-sister Georganne LaPiere was a major X-Files fan, and Carter learned through LaPiere that Cher herself was intrigued by the show and would be interested in making an X-Files guest appearance. Sitcom star Roseanne Barr also expressed an interest in guesting on The X-Files, and Carter wrote the part of Shaineh Berkowitz specifically for her. Barr, however, was unavailable at the time of shooting—her projected role was filled by Pattie Tierce— while Cher passed on the proffered cameo appearance performing as herself, a decision for which she later expressed regret: [...] "I wanted them to ask me to <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> act—then they just wanted me to <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> sing ... Just to <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> be myself wasn't anything I'd want to do until I saw [...] " [...] — [...] "Had I [...] the quality of [...] I would have done it in a heartbeat." [...] Cher did authorize the use of three of her tracks on the episode's soundtrack including [...] "Walking in Memphis" [...] heard at the episode's conclusion while ostensibly performed onstage by celebrity impersonator Tracey Bell—filmed in longshot or from the back or overheard—as Cher. Although Bell was credited for the role, Cher's fans responded to the episode's premiere with online speculation as to whether the singer had pseudonymously appeared in the episode. [...] Tabloid talk show host Jerry Springer appeared as himself. These casting choices went against a long-standing tradition on The X-Files of only casting actors who were not well-known.|$|E
500|$|Shearer's pitch {{featured}} Vash, who {{had last}} been {{seen at the}} end of [...] "QPid" [...] leaving with Q, but the pitch did not include Q himself. Executive producer Michael Piller explained that they had already been {{looking for a way to}} introduce Q into DS9, and felt that bringing Vash onto the show would be a good way to seamlessly introduce Q. There were concerns about shoving Q into an episode but the idea of [...] "Q-Less" [...] alleviated them. [...] "If you just have him <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> say 'Look, is this the new show?' it's silly, but this seemed to be a justifiable way", Piller recalled.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Your Body", Aguilera sings {{of having}} a one-night stand with a random man. In the first verse, she [...] "angrily" [...] purrs, [...] "So open the box, don't need no key, I'm unlocked". Synthesizers and [...] "stuttering" [...] drums are {{featured}} at the pre-chorus, [...] "Don't even tell me your name/ All I {{need to know is}} whose place/ And let's get walking". Chris Martins of Spin commented that the lyrics actually means, [...] "The economy is in the tank, congress can't agree on anything, war and natural disasters consume us ... so, what else can we do but make love?" [...] At the second verse, she tells her lover, [...] "I am a freak, I'm disturbed/ So <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> give me your worst/ We're moving faster than slow/ If you don't know where to go/ I'll finish off on my own". The four-on-the-floor refrain has Aguilera [...] "flaunting her famous pipes" [...] on the chorus, [...] "All I wanna do is love your body/ Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it". In a track-by-track review for Lotus, Billboard critic Andrew Hampp thought that the song [...] "doesn't peak" [...] until Aguilera [...] "growls", [...] "I think you already know my name" [...] at the bridge. According to Jason Lipshutz from Billboard and Robert Cospey of Digital Spy, the lyrics of [...] "Your Body" [...] are similar to Aguilera's previous single [...] "Dirrty" [...] (2002).|$|E
500|$|... "Loverboy"'s hook {{is built}} around a sample of [...] "Candy", by Cameo. Aside from {{borrowing}} from the melody, [...] "Loverboy" [...] features Cameo as a lead vocalist on the track. According to Chuck Taylor from Billboard, [...] "Loverboy" [...] is reminiscent of several of Carey's previous lead singles, as they too were predominantly built around samples of older songs. He described some of its background flourishes as [...] "swirling harmonies overtop", and noted the inclusion of many shouts and ad-libs from Carey and Cameo. Due to the song's heavy usage of the [...] "Candy" [...] sample, and the heavy blend of instrumentation and vocals, he said that to his bewilderment, the song was [...] "devoid of a standard hook". NMEs Elios Therepio felt the idea of sampling [...] "Candy" [...] was genius [...] "on paper", but once recorded, suffered from various miscalculations. He felt it didn't match the success Carey's previous single, [...] "Fantasy" [...] (which also recalled its melody from an older song), and criticized the inclusion of several over-the-top [...] "keyboard and synth arrangements". Regarding Carey's voice, aside from describing it as [...] "obscured", Therepio expressed his difficulty in understanding her lyrical phrases, claiming it was weakened from [...] "no-everyone-can-understand-what-you're-saying'-itis". Gil Kaufman from MTV News noted the inclusion of [...] "bouncing funky bass [...] rock guitars", while Roger Caitlin of the Hartford Courant described how Carey was often reduced to [...] "breathy background vocals" [...] on [...] "Loverboy". Lyrically, the song finds Carey looking for her [...] "loverboy", and a sugar-daddy that's going to [...] "love her right". Therepio found it ironic how Carey was crooning for a sugar-daddy, when she had just left one (referring to her older ex-husband Tommy Mottola). Additionally, he felt Carey was molding her image {{from that of a}} balladeer, to a [...] "pin-up image" [...] of a pop star. The song's lyrics are racy, and feature the protagonist asking for her [...] "loverboy" [...] to fulfill her sexual desires: [...] "Loverboy <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> love me / Give me more".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} pair of jealous {{strippers}} applying lipstick and caddying back-and-forth between backstage, in a South of the Border strip zoo named [...] "La Jungla". Meanwhile, Mars' [...] "Money Make Her Smile" [...] can be heard from the room, the two of them are talking about a new girl who has been [...] "fooling around" [...] with someone else's man (Mr. Mars). The scene ends with one of the two women saying, [...] "Wait 'til I tell the boss what she's sleeping with". It is shown that the new girl, Isabella, has been listening to the conversation and it's her time to dance as soon as the boss says so. The role of Isabella is portrayed by Indian actress Freida Pinto, who after an introduction by Guzmán, the zoo owner, starts to pull off [...] "gravity-defying spins on the pole" [...] as Mars and his mates, who serve as the house band, perform the song. On the following scene, Isabella sheds her clothes with such rage that sparks fall from the ceiling while Mars stares at her intensely singing [...] "You and me baby making love like gorillas". As the second verse starts, intermittent shots of Mars and Isabella [...] "heating up the backseat of a car" [...] along with shots of her [...] "grinding on customers" [...] and banging on Mars' chest as he sings the line [...] "Bang Bang, Gorilla". The former shots are shown throughout the video. As the video continues, Isabella is shown [...] "to drop on her knees and lick" [...] Mars' guitar. She grabs it and pours tequila over the same, before using a lighter to set it on fire. Afterwards, the roof sprinklers <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> Isabella lets the water shower her while she stands on her underwear. The video ends in a chase scene in which Mars runs down through a dimly lit aisle, and suddenly transforms into a giant gorilla, while Isabella is seen {{at the end of the}} pathway waiting for him. The video doesn't contain any of the teasers Mars released days before the video, including the iguana shot, the outer car scene and the one with Luis Guzman listening to the intro for Isabella.|$|E

When she said she earned £92,000, Foulkes said: [...] "£92,000? So you're paid nearly {{twice as much as}} an MP to <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> talk this nonsense."

2500|$|English is {{the first}} {{language}} {{of the community and}} county. [...] As with most regions in the Canada, dialects exist. [...] Some interesting dialectal forms of words and unique phrases are spoken in the community and county at large--sometimes known as [...] "Lunenburg English". [...] Although these uses are not universal, they are widespread. [...] Some words are spoken without a conventional hard [...] "r" [...] consonant such as [...] "ova" [...] (over), [...] "hause" [...] (horse), [...] "aw" [...] (our), and [...] "ca" [...] (car). [...] Others are spoken with an unconventional use of vowels such as [...] "tamarra" [...] (tomorrow), [...] "sure" [...] (sure pronounced the shore), and [...] "ta" [...] (to). [...] Some contractions and word clips have been created to accommodate those missing in the English language such as [...] "daren't" [...] (dare not), [...] "'mon" [...] (<b>come</b> <b>on),</b> <b>and</b> [...] "'bout" [...] (about).|$|E
2500|$|From 1974 {{until his}} 2002 death, Waylon Jennings {{performed}} a song {{he had written}} called [...] "Bob Wills Is Still The King". Released as the B-side of a single that was a double-sided hit, it went to {{number one on the}} country charts. [...] The song has become a staple of classic country radio station formats. [...] In addition, The Rolling Stones performed this song live in Austin, Texas at Zilker Park on their A Bigger Bang Tour, thereby giving the song, and Bob Wills, a broader audience. [...] This performance was included on their subsequent DVD The Biggest Bang. In a 1968 issue of Guitar Player, rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix said of Wills and the Playboys: [...] "I dig them. The Grand Ole Opry used to <b>come</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> I used to watch that. [...] They used to have some pretty heavy cats, some heavy guitar players." ...|$|E
