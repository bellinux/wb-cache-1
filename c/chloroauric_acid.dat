50|$|For {{industrial}} gold production Wohlwill process {{is necessary for}} highest purity gold applications, and when lower purity gold is required refiners often utilize the Miller process due to its relative ease, quicker turnaround times, and {{because it does not}} require a large inventory of gold, in the form of <b>chloroauric</b> <b>acid,</b> on site at all times.|$|E

The most frequently used extractants for this purpose are dibutyl glycol, methyl isobutyl ketone, tributyl phosphate, dichlorodiethyl ether (chlorex).|$|E
5000|$|The Wohlwill {{process is}} an industrial-scale {{chemical}} procedure used to refine gold {{to the highest}} degree of purity (99.999%). The process was invented in 1874 by Emil Wohlwill. This electrochemical process involves using a cast dore ingot, often called a Doré bar, of 95%+ gold {{to serve as an}} anode. Lower percentages of gold in the anode will interfere with the reaction, especially when the contaminating metal is silver or one of the platinum group elements. The cathode(s) for this reaction are small sheets of pure (24k) gold sheeting or stainless steel. Current is applied to the system, and electricity travels through the electrolyte of <b>chloroauric</b> <b>acid.</b> Gold and other metals are dissolved at the anode, and pure gold (coming through the <b>chloroauric</b> <b>acid</b> by ion transfer) is plated onto the gold cathode. When the anode is dissolved, the cathode is removed and melted or otherwise processed in the manner required for sale or use. The resulting gold is 99.999% pure, and of higher purity than gold produced by the other common refining method, the Miller process, which produces gold of 99.95% purity.|$|E
50|$|The Wohlwill {{process is}} {{commonly}} used for producing high-purity gold, such as in electronics work and the manufacture of some silicates, where exacting standards of purity are required. When highest purity gold is not required, refiners often utilize the Miller process due to its relative ease, quicker turnaround times, and {{because it does not}} tie up the large amount of gold in the form of <b>chloroauric</b> <b>acid</b> which the Wohlwill process permanently requires for the electrolyte.|$|E
50|$|While AuNPs {{themselves}} {{appear to}} have low or negligible toxicity, and the literature shows that the toxicity has {{much more to do}} with the ligands rather than the particles themselves, the synthesis of them involves chemicals that are hazardous. Sodium borohydride, a harsh reagent, is used to reduce the gold ions to gold metal. The gold ions usually come from <b>chloroauric</b> <b>acid,</b> a potent acid. Because of the high toxicity and hazard of reagents used to synthesize AuNPs, the need for more “green” methods of synthesis arose.|$|E
50|$|Gold is {{unaffected}} by most acids. It does not react with hydrofluoric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, sulfuric, or nitric acid. It does react with selenic acid, and is dissolved by aqua regia, a 1:3 mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid. Nitric acid oxidizes the metal to +3 ions, {{but only in}} minute amounts, typically undetectable in the pure acid because of the chemical equilibrium of the reaction. However, the ions are removed from the equilibrium by hydrochloric acid, forming AuCl4− ions, or <b>chloroauric</b> <b>acid,</b> thereby enabling further oxidation.|$|E
5000|$|Gold(III) chloride, {{traditionally}} called auric chloride, is {{a chemical}} compound {{of gold and}} chlorine.

5000|$|Aqua regia dissolves gold, {{though neither}} {{constituent}} acid {{will do so}} alone, because, in combination, each acid performs a different task. Nitric acid is a powerful oxidizer, which will actually dissolve a virtually undetectable amount of gold, forming gold ions (Au3+). The hydrochloric acid provides a ready supply of chloride ions (Cl−), which react with the gold ions to produce tetrachloroaurate(III) anions, also in solution. The reaction with hydrochloric acid is an equilibrium reaction which favors formation of chloroaurate anions (AuCl4−). This results in a removal of gold ions from solution and allows further oxidation of gold to take place. The gold dissolves to become <b>chloroauric</b> <b>acid.</b> In addition, gold may be dissolved by the free chlorine present in aqua regia. Appropriate equations are: ...|$|E
50|$|Generally, gold {{nanoparticles}} {{are produced}} in a liquid ("liquid chemical methods") {{by reduction of}} <b>chloroauric</b> <b>acid</b> (HAuCl4). After dissolving HAuCl4, the solution is rapidly stirred while a reducing agent is added. This causes Au3+ ions to be reduced to Au+ions. Then a disproportionation reaction occurs whereby 3 Au+ ions give rise to Au3+ and 2 Au0 atoms. The Au0 atoms act as center of nucleation around which further Au+ ions gets reduced. To prevent the particles from aggregating, some sort of stabilizing agent that sticks to the nanoparticle surface is usually added. In the Turkevich method of Au NP synthesis, citrate initially acts as the reducing agent and finally as the capping agent which stabilizes the Au NP through electrostatic interactions between the {{lone pair of electrons}} on the oxygen and the metal surface. Also, gold colloids can be synthesised without stabilizers by laser ablation in liquids.|$|E
50|$|Inorganic Nanocages are hollow, porous gold {{nanoparticles}} {{ranging in}} size from 10 to over 150 nm. They are created by reacting silver nanoparticles with <b>chloroauric</b> <b>acid</b> (HAuCl4) in boiling water. While gold nanoparticles absorb light in the visible spectrum of light (at about 550 nm), gold nanocages absorb light in the near-infrared, where biological tissues absorb the least light. Because they are also biocompatible, gold nanocages are promising as a contrast agent for optical coherence tomography, which uses light scattering in a way analogous to ultrasound to produce in-vivo images of tissue with resolution approaching a few micrometres. A contrast agent is required if this technique will be able to image cancers at an early, more treatable stage. Gold nanocages also absorb light and heat up, killing surrounding cancer cells. The Xia group at Washington University, the original inventors of the nanocages, has functionalized nanocages with cancer-specific antibodies so they specifically attach to cancer cells.|$|E
5000|$|Gold-catalyzed {{reactions}} {{fall into}} two major categories: heterogeneous catalysis including catalysts by gold nanoparticles and thiol-monolayer gold surfaces, and homogeneous catalysis that occurs with gold(I) or gold(III) compounds and is used for organic synthesis. Binary gold halides and simple complexes, including gold(I) chloride, gold(III) chloride, and <b>chloroauric</b> <b>acid,</b> have been employed as complexes. These gold sources, however, give rise to ill-defined and easily deactivated (via reduction to Au0) active catalysts in solution. The development of well-defined phosphine- or NHC-ligated gold(I) complexes was an important advance and led to significant increase in interest in the synthetic applications of gold catalysis. Ligated gold(I) complexes are typically prepared and stored as the bench-stable (but unreactive) chlorides, LAuCl, e.g., chloro(triphenylphosphine)gold(I), which are typically activated via halide abstraction with silver salts like AgOTf, AgBF4, or AgSbF6 to generate a cationic gold(I) species. [...] Although the coordinatively unsaturated complex [...] "LAu+" [...] is notionally generated from a LAuCl/AgX mixture, {{the exact nature of}} the cationic gold species {{and the role of the}} silver salt remains somewhat contentious.|$|E
