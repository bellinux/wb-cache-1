50|$|The {{protocols}} for 5' or 3' RACES differ slightly. 5' RACE-PCR begins using mRNA as {{a template}} for a first round of cDNA synthesis (or reverse transcription) reaction using an anti-sense (reverse) oligonucleotide primer that recognizes a known sequence {{in the middle of}} the gene of interest; the primer is called a gene specific primer (GSP). The primer binds to the mRNA, and the enzyme reverse transcriptase adds base pairs to the 3' end of the primer to generate a specific single-stranded cDNA product; this is the reverse complement of the mRNA. Following cDNA synthesis, the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is used to add a string of identical nucleotides, known as a <b>homopolymeric</b> <b>tail,</b> to the 3' end of the cDNA. (There are some other ways to add the 3'-terminal sequence for the first strand of the de novo cDNA synthesis which are much more efficient than <b>homopolymeric</b> <b>tailing,</b> but the sense of the method remains the same). A PCR reaction is then carried out, which uses a second anti-sense gene specific primer (GSP2) that binds to the known sequence, and a sense (forward) universal primer (UP) that binds the <b>homopolymeric</b> <b>tail</b> added to the 3' ends of the cDNAs to amplify a cDNA product from the 5' end.|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of hybridization of pigeon globin messenger RNA with complementary cDNA synthesized {{by means}} of AMV reverse transcriptase is complex. Addition of poly A or poly U in excess to the reaction mixture normalized the kinetics. It is concluded that association of the <b>complementary</b> <b>homopolymeric</b> regions of mRNA and cDNA accelerates the complex formation between heteropolymeric sequences in {{a fraction of the}} molecules...|$|R
40|$|Chicken {{erythrocyte}} inner histones (H 2 A, H 2 B, H 3 and H 4) {{were associated}} with the two <b>complementary</b> <b>homopolymeric</b> polydeoxyribonucleotides and the two alternating copolymeric polydeoxyribonucleotides. No evidence for formation of chromatin-like structures was obtained for the complexes with poly(dG). poly(dC) or poly(dA). poly(dT). Both poly (dGdC). poly(dGdC) and poly(dAdT). poly(dAdT) could be folded by histones to yield material digested by DNAase I to multiples of about 10 and by staphylococcal nuclease to 146 bp core particles. Due to the lack of sequence heterogeniety in the complex of histones with poly(dAdT). poly(dAdT), core particles with remarkable fine structural detail are obtained. The internal organization of DNA in the AT-containing and GC-containing core particles appears not to be identical...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Bioconjugating single {{molecules}} of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I into electronic nanocircuits allowed electrical recordings of enzymatic function and dynamic variability with {{the resolution of}} individual nucleotide incorporation events. Continuous recordings of DNA polymerase processing multiple homopolymeric DNA tem-plates extended over 600 s and through> 10 000 bond-forming events. An enzymatic processivity of 42 nucleotides for a template of the same length was directly observed. Statistical analysis determined key kinetic parameters for the enzyme’s open and closed conformations. Consistent with these nanocircuit-based observations, the enzyme’s closed complex forms a phosphodiester bond in a highly efficient process> 99. 8 % of the time, with a mean duration of only 0. 3 ms for all four dNTPs. The rate-limiting step for catalysis occurs during the enzyme’s open state, but with a nearly 2 -fold longer duration for dATP or dTTP incorporation than for dCTP or dGTP into <b>complementary,</b> <b>homopolymeric</b> DNA templates. Taken together, the results provide a wealth of new information complementing prior work on the mechanism and dynamics of DNA polymerase I...|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{studies of}} plant-pathogen {{interaction}} {{are very important}} for the identification of gene (s) related with the pathogenic process, {{as well as with the}} plant resistance. These gene (s) could be use for the genetic improvement programs in order to obtain resistant cultivars. The aim of this work was to construct complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries from infected leaves with Pseudocercospora fijiensis CCIBP-Pf 1 isolated of two banana cultivars (a resistant one Calcutta 4 and another one susceptible Niyarma Yik). First-strand cDNA synthesis, was made beginning with one microgram of total RNA by using oligo dT primer and cDNA quality was checked by Polimerase chain reaction (PCR) with cytochrome b specific primers. Second-strand cDNA synthesis was performed by using the <b>homopolymeric</b> <b>tailing</b> with dC-BamH I + dT-Not I primer combination. Four cDNA libraries of infected plants at different times of infection with the pathogen were obtained. Forty one clones of one of the libraries of Niyarma Yik were sequenced and the obtained sequences correspond with genes related to fungi.

40|$|We have {{constructed}} a recombinant cDNA library to facilitate {{study of the}} genomic actions of vitamin D 3 and its hormonally active metabolite 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 in initiation of the de novo biosynthesis of a 28, 000 -dalton vitamin D-dependent calcium binding protein (CaBP) present in chick intestine. The recombinant plasmids were prepared by the <b>homopolymeric</b> <b>tailing</b> and hybridization method using as a starting template poly(A) -enriched mRNA obtained from the intestinal mucosa of vitamin D 3 -replete (+D) chicks. Screening of 9, 516 clones in this library was effected by using a comparative in situ colony hybridization technique with two [32 P]cDNA probes; these probes were prepared from total poly(A) -RNA from chick intestinal mucosa of vitamin D-deficient (-D) chicks and a poly(A) -RNA specifically enriched for chick intestinal CaBP mRNA by immunoprecipitation of polysomes derived from vitamin D-replete (+D) chicks. We identified 26 clones that consistently displayed a significantly increased hybridization signal when comparing the -D vs. CaBP-enriched probe. Further evaluation of these clones by hybrid-selected translation showed the presence of CaBP-specific sequences. By "RNA gel" analysis of poly(A) -RNA, three independent mRNA species were found to hybridize to a CaBP clone; none of these RNA species were found in -D poly(A) -RNA. With this comparative colony hybridization procedure, {{we were able to}} identify CaBP-specific clones corresponding to a mRNA that is 0. 1 % of the total poly(A) -mRNA. The differential colony hybridization procedure using an enriched vs. a nonenriched probe should be of value in screening for other cDNA clones complementary to rare mRNA species...|$|R
40|$|Double {{stranded}} DNA {{has been}} synthesized in vitro from rabbit globin messenger RNA and elongated with <b>homopolymeric</b> dG <b>tails.</b> An E. coli plasmid was cleaved by EcoRI. The cohesive ends were repaired and dC tails added, to permit reconstitution of the EcoRI sites upon annealing with the dG elongated globin DNA. Transformation of E. coli with the globin-plasmid DNA hybrid has yielded a clone which harbours a recombinant plasmid (pCR 1 -betaG 1), {{as demonstrated by}} hybridization experiments with radioactive globin cDNA. The sequence carried by the recombinant plasmid corresponds to part of the gene sequence coding for the beta chain of rabbit globin.

40|$|Restriction-fragment {{libraries}} containing adenovirus type 2 (Ad 2) DNA {{have been}} constructed, using the pBR 322 plasmid (Bolivar et al., 1977) as a vector. Clones have been isolated which contain all the HindIII fragments of Ad 2 DNA except the terminal G- and K-fragments {{inserted into the}} HindIII cleavage site of the vector. All the 13 SmaI-fragments of Ad 2 DNA were separately inserted into the PstI site of the pBR 322 vector after addition of <b>homopolymeric</b> poly(dG) <b>tails</b> to the fragments and poly(dC) tails to the linearized plasmid. Two large fragments of adenovirus type 5 (AD 5) DNA, located between map positions 17. 0 and 59. 5 and between map positions 59. 5 and 97. 3, respectively, were cloned using bacteriophage lambda as a vector.

40|$|We have cloned and {{identified}} a DNA sequence complementary to the mRNA of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UroDCase) from rat. This mRNA {{is a minor}} species (0. 1 %) of the total mRNA from anemic rat spleen. Poly(A) + mRNA was enriched for UroDCase mRNA to 20 % purity by a very efficient procedure involving two successive steps of preparative gel electrophoresis under various denaturing conditions. cDNA prepared from partially purified UroDCase mRNA (1 % purity) was cloned in the Pst I site of pBR 322 by using the <b>homopolymeric</b> G-C <b>tailing</b> method. Primary screening of 500 clones from this cDNA library was performed with a cDNA probe complementary to highly purified mRNA for UroDCase (20 % purity) and UroDCase cDNA clones were finally identified by hybrid-selected translation. The rat cDNA clones obtained hybridize to human UroDCase mRNA.

40|$|Human {{erythropoietin}} (Ep) cDNA {{has been}} cloned in Escherichia coli by using pBR 322 as a vector. Polyadenylylated RNA was isolated from selected human renal carcinomas with elevated Ep titers. The presence of Ep mRNA {{was detected by}} immunoprecipitation of in vitro translation products with monoclonal antibody to human Ep. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized and inserted into the Pst I site of pBR 322 by <b>homopolymeric</b> dG. dC <b>tailing.</b> The cDNA library was initially screened by colony hybridization with 32 P-labeled cDNA synthesized from size-fractionated mRNA enriched in Ep message. Positive colonies were further screened immunologically by in situ radioimmunoassay with monoclonal antibody to human Ep. Three positive clones were identified that express the Ep gene sequences as a beta-lactamase fusion protein. These clones contain inserts of approximately 1400, 600, and 200 base pairs. Human renal Ep mRNA, of which the translation products immunoreact with anti-Ep on immunoblots, was hybrid-selected by plasmid DNA from these recombinants. Purified human Ep competes with 35 S-labeled hybrid-selected translation products for antibody binding...|$|R
