500|$|The Two Towers {{received}} critical acclaim; film site aggregator Rotten Tomatoes {{reported that}} 96 percent of critics were positive. CNN film critic Paul Clinton called The Two Towers an [...] "utter triumph", and writer Philip French of The Guardian {{noted in a}} review of the second film that [...] "these Tolkien films have a weight and seriousness that very few sword-and-sorcery pictures of the past 30-odd years have attained." [...] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman remarked [...] "The Two Towers conjures an illusion of the gravity that you want from an emotionally charged storybook epic. Really, though, what it <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>is</b> superbly staged battle scenes and moral alliances forged in earnest yet purged of the wit and dynamic, bristly ego that define true on-screen personality." [...] The film was also listed on a number of critics' lists; Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics named The Two Towers 2002's third best film, while Central Ohio Film Critics named The Two Towers that year's fifth best film and Southeastern Film Critics ranked it the eighth.|$|E

If this can be done, with sufficient funding and aid to implement such technologies, it is feasible to eliminate clean water scarcity for the African continent by the Millennium Development Goal deadline of 2015.|$|E

The game's educational properties - its abundance of [...] "mathematical concepts...world geography, cultures and their customs" [...] was praised. IGN noted a few similarities between this game and the Professor Layton series, and suggested that the former sought inspiration from the latter due to the gameplay elements of collecting coins and solving puzzles. It noted [...] "Whoever picked up the Professor Layton games and realized their style of puzzles could reinvigorate the Carmen Sandiego franchise was a genius -- it's a great combination of a newer type of video game puzzle play and a classic educational brand".

5000|$|The match, dubbed by American sports {{promoter}} Don King as the [...] "Grapple in the Apple", {{began at}} 5:00 pm (UTC-5). The pair easily held the opening three games, before Federer launched his first assault on Murray's serve at 2-1 up; he could not, however, convert his one break point opportunity. Federer eased through next service game, and broke Murray {{for the first}} time at 3-2 following a succession of errors from Murray. Federer fired another series of big serves in the seventh game, and then broke Murray to win the first set, 6-2, in twenty-seven minutes. Murray lost the first two games of the second set, meaning that Federer had won a cumulative total of six games in a row. Murray immediately broke back though, and appeared to have steadied himself by winning the next game, allowing Federer only one point. Federer failed to hit any successful first serves in the next game, and Murray gained three consecutive break points at 0-40. Federer won the next three points, despite, on evidence of a replay, having clearly hit one of his shots long. Because Murray did not stop the point, he could not challenge the call; after the match, when Murray was asked about this, he said he was disappointed, but thought that the rules were correct in not allowing retrospective challenges. Both players comfortably held the next four games, although some minor threats presented themselves for Federer at 4-4, 0-15 and 30-30 (Murray hit backhands long both times). Murray was aided in the next game, when he was serving to stay in the set, as Federer hit four unforced errors, all going long. Federer won the next game, and then seized his final opportunity on a Murray service game, winning the final game of the second set to love.Federer began to overpower his opponent in the third set; Murray was broken to love twice as Federer raced ahead to a 5-0 lead, with Murray winning only four points up to that point. He did, however, win the next two games. Federer broke the game after though, winning on his second championship point in a point that required three smashes from the defending champion. The match lasted one hour and fifty-one minutes, thirteen minutes fewer than it took to complete the women's final. The only players that Federer had not surpassed, in terms of US Open wins, at this point in his career were: Richard Sears, who had won seven straight, Bill Larned, who won seven overall, and Bill Tilden with six straight and seven overall (all three of these players played before the open era). In the last on-court televised interview, Federer was adamant that he would not stop at thirteen, describing such a scenario as [...] "terrible". Federer, who at the time had a total win-loss record of 45-4 at the Open and 34-match winning streak, said that the streak was of great importance to him, especially after having lost at Wimbledon. Reflecting on his year, he said, [...] "I had a couple of tough Grand Slams this year. To take this one home is incredible." [...] Murray said of the competition with Federer in tournaments that [...] "I got the better of him the past two times, but he definitely set the record straight", and said, on his future, [...] "I know mentally now that I can get to a Slam final, and physically. The only thing it <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>is</b> the tennis." [...] Paying tribute to Federer, he said that, [...] "I came up against, in my opinion, the best player ever to play the game." ...|$|E
