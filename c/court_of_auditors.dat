5|$|The <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Auditors</b> {{was set up}} in 1975. It {{was created}} as an {{independent}} institution due to the sensitivity of the issue of fraud in the Union (the anti-fraud agency, OLAF, is also built on its independence). It is composed of one member from each state appointed by the Council every six years. Every three years one of them is elected {{as the president of the}} court, who is currently Vítor Manuel da Silva Caldeira.|$|E
5|$|The European <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Auditors</b> (ECA), {{despite its}} name, has no {{judicial}} powers. It ensures that taxpayer {{funds from the}} budget of the European Union have been correctly spent. The court provides an audit report for each financial year to the Council and Parliament. The Parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the Commission's handling of the budget. The Court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions.|$|E
5|$|The {{institutions}} of the European Union are the seven principal decision making bodies of the European Union (EU). They are, as listed in Article 13 of the Treaty on European Union: the European Parliament, the European Council, the Council of the European Union, the European Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Auditors.</b> Institutions are different from agencies of the European Union.|$|E

5|$|The European Commission {{also has}} its seat in Brussels, {{although}} some departments are hosted by Luxembourg. The European Court of Justice, the General Court, and the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Auditors</b> are based in Luxembourg along with the European Investment Bank. The Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions are entirely based in Brussels while the European Central Bank is based in Frankfurt and Europol is the only agency to have its seat fixed by the treaties, in the Hague.|$|E
5|$|To {{compensate}} Luxembourg for {{the loss}} of the Commission and Council, a number of provisions were laid out. Firstly, the Court of Justice would remain in the city. Some departments of the Commission and the Assembly, including the Secretariat of the Assembly would remain along with European Investment Bank (further, particularly financial, institutions would also be prioritised for Luxembourg). The Council would also have to hold sessions in Luxembourg during April, June and October. It also confirmed Strasbourg as the seat of the Parliament. With the prioritisation of Luxembourg for future institutions, in 1977 the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Auditors</b> became provisionally located in Luxembourg.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament {{also has}} other powers of general supervision, mainly {{granted by the}} Maastricht Treaty. The Parliament {{has the power to}} set up a Committee of Inquiry, for example over mad cow disease or CIA {{detention}} flights—the former {{led to the creation of}} the European veterinary agency. The Parliament can call other institutions to answer questions and if necessary to take them to court if they break EU law or treaties. Furthermore, it has powers over the appointment of the members of the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Auditors</b> and the president and executive board of the European Central Bank. The ECB president is also obliged to present an annual report to the parliament.|$|E

5|$|The Parliament is also {{responsible}} for discharging the implementation of previous budgets based on the annual report of the European <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Auditors.</b> It has refused to approve the budget only twice, in 1984 and in 1998.

Para a execução do estudo, foi realizada uma pesquisa bibliográfica acerca dos papéis dos TC, transparência e accountability. Foi realizada uma pesquisa documental buscando relacionar, nos documentos de prestações de contas disponíveis nos sítios eletrônicos dos TC, as discrepâncias decorrentes de contabilização indevida com a sugestão de aplicação de sanções, apurações de responsabilidades ou republicação. Os resultados apontam que os TC não recomendam a aplicação de sanções, apuração de responsabilidade ou a republicação das demonstrações contábeis.

25|$|Luxembourg {{is one of}} the {{de facto}} capitals of the European Union (alongside Brussels and Strasbourg), as it is the seat of several {{institutions}} of the European Union, including the European Court of Justice, the European <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Auditors,</b> the Secretariat of the European Parliament, the European Investment Bank, the European Investment Fund, and the European Stability Mechanism.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Auditors</b> {{checks that}} all the Union's revenue has been {{received}} and all its expenditure incurred in a lawful and regular manner and that the EU budget has been managed soundly.

25|$|The fifth {{institution}} is the European <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Auditors,</b> which despite its name had no judicial powers like the Court of Justice. Instead, it ensured that taxpayer {{funds from the}} Community budget have been correctly spent. The court provided an audit report for each financial year to the Council and Parliament and gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions.

40|$|Corruption {{is one of}} {{the serious}} Brazilian problems. The {{embezzlement}} of public funds prevents the realization of fundamental social rights and delays national develop- ment prevent inhibiting the real access to citizenship. Brazil needs to face the paradox of being the eighth world’s largest economy, and having low human development indexes. Social justice does not coexist with impunity. Public funds, paid by taxpayers, sidetracked by corruption schemes, fail to reach the investments in the enlargement of public health, education, security and infrastructure. Moreover, the opportunity of corruption increases corruption when there is impunity. To reduce corruption levels in Brazil, it is urgent to think about legal system improvement alternatives, a task which is also entrusted to the academy. Although positive law does not change social reality, the lack of appropriate legal mechanisms prevents the equating of part of the Brazilian’s society problems, such as corruption. In the extrapenal sphere, beginning with constitutional law, it is important to emphasize the need to improve issues such as the strengthening of internal and external controls, reforming constitutional institutions, such as the <b>Courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Auditors.</b> In addi- tion, the enlargement of transparency and social control of the prosecution performance in infra constitutional sphere requires fundamental legislative reforms, in order to provide for the realization of the human rights enshrined in the 1988 Constitution...|$|R
5000|$|In 1981, he was {{sued for}} having stolen Algerian embassies' money between 1965 and 1979. On 8 August 1983, Bouteflika was convicted by the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Financial <b>Auditors</b> and {{found guilty of}} having fraudulently taken 60 million dinars during his {{diplomatic}} career. In his defence Bouteflika said that he [...] "reserved" [...] that money {{to build a new}} building for the foreign affairs ministry, but the court judged his argument as [...] "fallacious". In 1979, just after the death of Boumédiène, Bouteflika reimbursed 12,212,875.81 dinars out of the 70 million dinars that was deposited in a Swiss bank. Although Bouteflika was granted amnesty by President Chadli Bendjedid, his colleagues Senouci and Boudjakdji were jailed. After the amnesty, Bouteflika was given back his diplomatic passport, a villa where he used to live but did not own and all his debt was erased. He never paid back the money [...] "he reserved for a new foreign affairs ministry's building".|$|R
