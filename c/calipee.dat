60|$|George pooh-poohed {{the wine}} and bullied the waiters royally, and Jos gobbled the turtle with immense satisfaction. Dobbin helped him to it; for {{the lady of the}} house, before whom the tureen was placed, was so ignorant of the contents, {{that she was going to}} help Mr. Sedley without bestowing upon him either calipash or <b>calipee.</b>|$|E
60|$|In {{view of the}} {{description}} given, may one be gay upon the Encantadas? Yes: that is, find one the gayety, {{and he will be}} gay. And, indeed, sackcloth and ashes as they are, the isles are not perhaps unmitigated gloom. For while no spectator can deny their claims to a most solemn and superstitious consideration, no more than my firmest resolutions can decline to behold the spectre-tortoise when emerging from its shadowy recess; yet even the tortoise, dark and melancholy as it is upon the back, still possesses a bright side; its <b>calipee</b> or breast-plate being sometimes of a faint yellowish or golden tinge. Moreover, every one knows that tortoises as well as turtle are of such a make, that if you but put them on their backs you thereby expose their bright sides without the possibility of their recovering themselves, and turning into view the other. But after you have done this, and because you have done this, you should not swear that the tortoise has no dark side. Enjoy the bright, keep it turned up perpetually if you can, but be honest, and don't deny the black. Neither should he, who cannot turn the tortoise from its natural position so as to hide the darker and expose his livelier aspect, like a great October pumpkin in the sun, for that cause declare the creature to be one total inky blot. The tortoise is both black and bright. But let us to particulars.|$|E
60|$|Such was {{the wild}} {{nightmare}} begot by my first {{impression of the}} Encantadas tortoise. But next evening, strange to say, I sat down with my shipmates, and made a merry repast from tortoise steaks, and tortoise stews; and supper over, out knife, and helped convert the three mighty concave shells into three fanciful soup-tureens, and polished the three flat yellowish <b>calipees</b> into three gorgeous salvers.|$|R

Spence, PCS, are said to show the component parts of nitrogen and phosphoric acid to make it of commercial value as a phosphate fertiliser which {{could be used as a}} base in the manufacture of complete compound fertilisers.In addition to the guano commercial use of the coral obtainable from the islands may be mace by conversion into lime, a branch of industry now followed farther north, whence lime for the sugar industry is drawn in large quantities. The company proposes, with a formula which has been proved satisfactory, to prepare turtle soup, turtle extract and <b>calipee</b> and calapash for [...]he overseas market. Fish and other Great Barrier products will also be dealt in by the company.|$|E
40|$|AbstractMurzuq Basin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} basins in Libya. It has many oil fields; H-field {{is one of the}} new discoveries in NC- 186 concession in Murzuq Basin, Libya. This field has been affected by the structural and tectonic movements of Murzuq Basin and created paleo-high during the post-Hawaz erosional events. Ten exploratory wells were drilled for that field and well logging data were collected. The well logging data include Self potential, Gamma ray, <b>Calipee,</b> Resistivity, and Porosity logs (sonic, neutron, density). The recorded well logging data have been used for quick look interpretation and then correlated with both core data report and the plotted crossplots. The quick look results indicate that this reservoir is clean, highly porous and permeable. This reservoir is divided into 8 units/horizons (from H 1 to H 8), which are mainly sandstone with few intercalations of clay. Both well logging and core data are highly concordant. The results of the petrophysical characteristics have ascertained that H 4 –H 6 are oil bearing zones while H 7 –H 8 are water bearing horizons...|$|E
