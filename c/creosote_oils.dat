30|$|Petroleum is {{a complex}} mixture of {{hydrocarbons}} and other organic compounds, including some organometallo-constituents. Petroleum constituents represent: saturates, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes. Saturates are defined as hydrocarbons containing no double bonds. They are categorized according to their chemical structures into alkanes (paraffins) and cycloalkanes. Saturates represents {{the highest percentage of}} crude oil constituents. The manufacture of petrochemicals begins with crude oil and natural gas which were formed millions of years ago, deep in the earth’s crust, due to the slow and lengthy decay of plants and animals. Worldwide industrial developments have released a large number of natural and synthetic hazardous compounds into the environment due to careless waste disposal, illegal waste dumping, and accidental spills. Industrial development has generated complex wastes, a complexity not only due to the quantity of wastes, but also to their composition (Wei and Huang 2001). As a result, there are numerous sites in the world that require clean-up of soils and sludge. Petroleum contamination of soil is a widespread and a well-recognized global environmental issue. One of the major constituents of petroleum is Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon’s (PAHs) which belong to the class of organic chemicals consisting of two or more benzene rings fused in a linear, angular, or cluster arrangement. PAHs are characterized by their high hydrophobicity, and resistance to natural degradation and carcinogenic properties. PAH releases to soils and other wider environment have led to higher concentrations of these contaminants that would not be expected from natural processes alone. They are known soil and aquatic contaminants. Whether naturally occurring or formed during the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, low concentrations can usually be found just about everywhere. They are also associated with industrial activities and around wood-preservation stations where <b>creosote</b> <b>oils</b> have been used (Piskonen and Itävaara 2004).|$|E

Besides this, it is utilized as an important and imperious reserve for the manufacture of products like <b>creosote</b> <b>oil,</b> naphthalene, phenol and benzene. Materials like activated carbon, carbon blacks and electrodes, have been synthesized from coal (Zhou et al. 2012). Compared with crystalline carbon allotropes, so-called lattice solids, such as graphite and diamond that have found applications {{in areas such as}} microelectronics, optoelectronics and biomedicine. The crystalline carbon within the coal structure consists of abundant irregular, polymerized aromatic hydrocarbon units, such as angstrom- or nanometer-sized crystalline carbon domains that are joined by weak cross-links. As coals possess many poly-aromatic structures similar to sp 2 bonding character of graphene, they are used as precursors for the production of nanomaterials. With the advent of carbon nano-structures, scientific research on coal based products have recently received ever-increasing attention (Geim 2009; Li et al. 2006; Zhou et al. 2012; Binoy et al. 2009; Das et al. 2016; Manoj and Kunjomana 2014).

The effect of hydrogen peroxide addition for 4 and 10 days and saturation of soil with H 2 O 2 on was studied. In both experiments the H 2 O 2 dosage was 0. 4 g H 2 O 2 /g soil. In completely H 2 O 2 -saturated soil the removal of PAHs (44 % within 4 days) by modified Fenton reaction was uniform over the entire soil column. In non-uniformly saturated soil, PAH removal was higher in completely saturated soil (52 % in 10 days) compared to partially saturated soil, with only 25 % in 10 days. The effect of the modified Fenton's reaction on the microbial activity in the soil was assessed based on toxicity tests towards Vibrio fischeri, enumeration of viable and dead cells, microbial extracellular enzyme activity, and oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production during soil incubation. During the laboratory-scale column experiments, the toxicity of column leachate towards Vibrio fischeri increased {{as a result of}} the modified Fenton's reaction. The activities of the microbial extracellular enzymes acetate- and acidic phosphomono-esterase were lower in the incubated modified Fenton's treated soil compared to extracellular enzyme activities in untreated soil. Abundance of viable cells was lower in incubated modified Fenton treated soil than in untreated soil. Incubation of soil in serum bottles at 20 degrees C resulted in consumption of oxygen and formation of carbon dioxide, indicating aerobic biodegradation of organic compounds. In untreated soil 20 - 30 % of the PAHs were biodegraded during 2 months of incubation.

40|$|Three {{types of}} wood preservatives, <b>creosote</b> <b>oil</b> (<b>Creosote),</b> {{chromated}} copper arsenate (CCA- 3) and ammoniacal copper quats (ACQ- 1) were studied, first by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under different heating rates (5 or 40 ℃/min), {{and then by}} using thermogravimetric analysis with infrared spectrometry (TGA-IR) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX). The results obtained from the TGA tests found that the decomposition temperature {{of each of the}} preservatives for the heating rate at 5 ℃/min was lower than that at 40 ℃/min. Regardless of different heating rate, the char (wt %) of the CCA- 3 was more than that of the ACQ- 1, and the amount of char for the Creosote was lower than that for either of the water-based preservatives. The IR response of all preservatives in the TGA-IR tests showed that at a heating rate of 5 ℃/min, the absorbance of Creosote and ACQ- 1 was higher than that of CCA- 3. This indicated that the concentration of evolved species of CCA- 3 was less than that of Creosote and ACQ- 1. However, at a heating rate of 40 ℃/min, the absorbance of CCA- 3 and ACQ- 1 was higher than that of Creosote. Considering the decomposition step (thermal time or temperature) at different heating rates in the TGA tests and the IR response from the TGA-IR analysis, the results obtained showed that at the slow-heating regime, the concentrations of CO_ 2 produced by Creosote and ACQ- 1 were higher than that of CCA- 3, but at the fast-heating regime, the concentration of CO_ 2 for ACQ- 1 was higher than that of Creosote and CCA- 3. The EDX analysis of all preservatives showed that the main element of the char for Creosote was C (82. 75 %) after combustion. The char of CCA- 3 had an amount of Cr (34. 99 %) that was obviously more than that of As (11. 89 %) and Cu (16. 69 %) due to Cr being a stable element during combustion. The char of ACQ- 1 left a high amount of inorganic metal elements, such as Cu (50. 14 %). These results, when compared to the chemical ingredients of all preservatives, enabled us to point out the kinds of evolved species for referencing the thermo-decomposition processes of the preservatives. The use of TGA for analyzing the thermal properties of three types of preservatives, in combination with TGA-IR and EDX analysis, has led to useful results, regarding the identification of thermal decomposition products (evolved species and char) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This study {{concentrates}} on developing and tuning various oil analysis methods {{to meet the}} requirements of modern industry and environmental analytics. Oil analysis methods form a vital part of techniques used to monitor the condition of machines and may help to improve the overall equipment effectiveness value of a factory in a significant manner. Worm gears are used in various production machines, and their breakdowns may cause significant production losses. Wearing of these gears is relatively difficult to monitor with vibration analysis. Analysis of two indicator metals, copper and iron, may reveal wearing phenomena of worm gears effectively, and savings can be significant. Effective wear metal analysis requires good tools. ICP-OES with kerosene dilution is widely used in wear metal analysis, but purchasing and using of ICP-OES is expensive. A cheaper FAAS technique with similar pre-treatment of oil samples was tested and it proved to be useful especially in analyzing small amounts of samples. The accuracy of FAAS was sufficient for quantitative work in machine diagnostics and waste oil characterization. Solid debris analyses are useful in oil contamination control as well as in detection of wearing mechanisms. Membrane filtration, optical microscopy, SEM and automatic particle counting were applied in analysis of rolling and gear oils. Particle counting is an effective way to detect oil contamination, but in the studied cases even larger particles than those detected in normal ISO classes would be informative. However, membrane filtration and optical microscopy may reveal the wearing machine element exactly. Additives provide oils with desired properties thus they should be monitored intensively. A FTIR method for quantitative analysis of fatty alcohols and fatty acid esters in machinery oils was developed during this work. It has already been used successfully in quantitative and qualitative analysis of machinery oil samples. Various kinds of oils may be spilled into the soil during use and in accident situations, and they can migrate to groundwater layers. Biodegradation of oils can remove them from the soil or water completely or at least diminish the amount of harmful substances. An automatic, respirometric BOD OxiTop method was used to evaluate the biodegradability of various oils in water and soil media. The biodegradation of certain bio and mineral hydraulic oils was evaluated in groundwater, where bio oils usually biodegraded more effectively than mineral oils. The use of oils in machines weakened especially the biodegradability of bio oils. Biodegradability of bio oils was also studied in standard conditions of OECD 301 F and bio oils usually biodegraded moderately good in these conditions. The biodegradation of forestry chain oils and wood preservative oils was evaluated in forest soils. Linseed oil biodegraded moderately, but certain experimental wood preservatives biodegraded more effectively. Widely used <b>creosote</b> <b>oil</b> biodegraded in a lesser degree. Rapeseed oil-based chain oils biodegraded more effectively than corresponding tall oil...|$|R

Guaiacol, instead of a full creosote solution, was suggested by Hermann Sahli in 1887; he argued it had the active chemical of creosote and had the advantage of being of definite composition and of having a less unpleasant taste and odor. A number of solutions of both creosote and guaiacol appeared on the market, such as phosphotal and guaicophosphal, phosphites of creosote and guaiacol; eosot and geosot, valerinates of creosote and guaicol; phosot and taphosot, phosphate and tannophospate of creosote; and creosotal and tanosal, tannates of creosote. <b>Creosote</b> and eucalptus <b>oil</b> were also a remedy used together, administered through a vaporizor and inhaler. Since then, more effective and safer treatments for tuberculosis have been developed.|$|R
50|$|A monitoring-well {{oil skimmer}} remediates various oils, ranging from light fuel oils such as petrol, light diesel or {{kerosene}} to heavy {{products such as}} No. 6 <b>oil,</b> <b>creosote</b> and coal tar. It consists of a continuously moving belt that runs on a pulley system driven by an electric motor. The belt material has a strong affinity for hydrocarbon liquids and for shedding water. The belt, which can have a vertical drop of 100+ feet, is lowered into the monitoring well past the LNAPL/water interface. As the belt moves through this interface, it picks up liquid hydrocarbon contaminant which is removed and collected at ground level as the belt passes through a wiper mechanism. To the extent that DNAPL hydrocarbons settle {{at the bottom of}} a monitoring well, and the lower pulley of the belt skimmer reaches them, these contaminants can also be removed by a monitoring-well oil skimmer.|$|R

50|$|Crude oil {{contamination}} in marine ecosystems {{can lead to}} both pyrogenic and petrogenic PAHs entering these ecosystems. Petrogenic PAHs can enter waterways through oil seeps, major <b>oil</b> spills, <b>creosote</b> and fuel <b>oil</b> runoff from urban areas. Pyrogenic PAH sources consist of diesel soot tire rubber and coal dust. Although there are natural sources of PAHs such as volcanic activity and seepage of coal deposits, anthropogenic sources pose the most significant input of PAHs into the environment. These anthroprogenic sources include residential heating, asphalt production, coal gasification, and petroleum usage. Petrogenic PAH contamination is more common from crude oil spills such as Exxon Valdez, or oil seeps; however, with runoff pyrogenic PAHs can also be prevalent. Although major oil spills such as Exxon Valdez can introduce {{a large amount of}} crude oil to a localized area in a short time span, daily runoff comprises most of the oil pollution to marine ecosystems. Atmospheric deposition can also be a source of PAHs into marine ecosystems. The deposition of PAHs from the atmosphere into a water body is largely influenced by the gas-particle partitioning of the PAH.|$|R
