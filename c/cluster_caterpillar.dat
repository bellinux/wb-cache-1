5000|$|Spodoptera litura, the Oriental leafworm moth, is a noctuid moth {{which is}} {{considered}} an agricultural pest. It {{is also known as}} the <b>cluster</b> <b>caterpillar,</b> cotton leafworm, tobacco cutworm, and tropical armyworm. It is found in the Indo-Australian tropics. It is also established on most Polynesian islands, where it occurs in a variety of island forms.|$|E
50|$|Crocidolomia pavonana is a moth of {{the family}} Crambidae. Its {{caterpillar}} is a crop pest and {{is known as the}} croci or the cabbage <b>cluster</b> <b>caterpillar.</b> This moth is found in Africa and Asia, its range extending from South Africa through India to the Pacific Ocean, including Australia. The wingspan is about 25 mm. The larvae feed on Brassicaceae species and are considered an agricultural pest on cabbages. At first, they feed only on the undersides of the leaves. Later they feed {{on the rest of the}} leaves and the central shoot.|$|E
40|$|Three analogues of TMOF PP H-Pro-Pro-OH PPPPPP H-Pro-Pro-Pro-Pro-Pro-Pro-OH and APPPPPP H-Pro-Pro-Pro-Pro-Pro-Pro-OH were {{successfully}} synthesised and screened for their insecticidal properties against cabbage <b>cluster</b> <b>caterpillar</b> Crocidolomia pavonana. All compounds were prepared through Fmoc-based solid-phase peptide synthesis SPPS method. The synthesis employed chlorotrityl resin as solid support. A combination of NN-diisopropylcarbodiimide DIC and ethyl 2 -cyano- 2 -hydroxyiminoacetate oxyma {{was chosen as}} coupling reagent in the synthesis. The peptide was cleaved by using TFA cocktail. All peptide crudes were purified by using reversed-phase flash chromatography with octadecyl silane ODS as stationary phase. All purified peptides were characterized by using TOF-ESMS and their purity was analysed using thin layer chromatography and analytical RP-HPLC. The synthesised TMOF analogues together with TMOF were biologically tested towards the C. pavonana at 1000 ppm. The results indicated that TMOF and the analogues were less effective for the cabbage <b>cluster</b> <b>caterpillar</b> compared to previously reported activity of TMOF towards Aedes aegypty...|$|E

40|$|We {{tested the}} most widely held theory about the mode of action of {{petroleum}} spray oils (PSOs) on insects (i. e. anoxia). An nC 24 petroleum oil was applied topically to cotton aphids (Aphis gossypii) and <b>cluster</b> <b>caterpillars</b> (Spodoptera litura), which then showed signs of mortality that are inconsistent with anoxia. The insects died soon after treatment, {{with most of the}} mortality occurring within the first 10 min. Toxicity symptoms included loss of locomotory ability, unusual abdominal contractions associated with spiracular fluttering, and ultimately dehydration and necrosis within 24 h. We therefore investigated the main mechanism(s) by which the nC 24 petroleum oil interacts with the insects’ cells and organs, and ultimately kills the insects. The results suggest a mode of action that relates to the liphophylic properties of the oil. This includes rapid penetration through the insect cuticle followed by accumulation in the lipid-containing tissues, mainly those of the CNS, and finally penetration into the nerve cells themselves. In vitro tests with isolated insect cells further revealed that the oil penetrates the cytoplasm and induces 100 % mortality of these cells within 2 min of application. No signs of oil accumulation within the tracheae were observed, so it is unlikely that anoxia is taking place at any stage of the intoxication process. Electrophysiological studies confirm that oil accumulation in the nerve ganglia has the direct effect of suppressing synaptic transmission in insect ganglia {{as well as in the}} neuromuscular junctions of vertebrates (toads and rats). These results demonstrate conclusively that at least some modern PSOs do not kill insects by anoxia, but by a range of cellular disruptions that lead to rapid insect death. The implications of our findings for the development of oil-based integrated pest management strategies are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Insecticidal {{potential}} of eleven species of Aglaia (Meliaceae) was evaluated {{in the laboratory}} against the cabbage <b>cluster</b> <b>caterpillar,</b> Crocidolomia binotalis. The feeding treatment of second-instar larvae C. binotalis for 48 hours with ethanol twig extract of A. odorata at 0. 5 % caused 98. 7 % larval mortality; leaf and twig extracts of A. elaeagnoidea caused 17. 3 % and 6. 7 % mortality, respectively; twig extracts of A. argentea, A. formosana, and A. latifolia caused only 1. 3 % mortality each; whereas extracts of the other six Aglaia species were inactive (0 % mortality). Further tests with A. odorata showed that twigs gave the most active extract compared to other plant parts (leaves, flowers, and roots), and air-drying of plant materials for 2 weeks markedly decreased {{the activity of the}} derived extracts. The active extracts also delayed the development of surviving larvae in similar degree to the level of their lethal effect. LC 50 of ethyl acetate fraction of A. odorata twig extract and its main active compound, rocaglamide, against C. binotalis larvae were 310. 2 and 31. 4 ppm, respectively. This active compound was about 8. 7 times less potent than azadirachtin (LC 50 3. 6 ppm). Key words: Aglaia, botanical insecticides, Crocidolomia binotali...|$|E

40|$|Spiders {{are thought}} to play a {{significant}} role in limiting pest outbreaks in agroecosystems such as vineyards, orchards and cotton. The diversity and impact of spiders in vegetable crops are less well understood, although there is evidence that predators may be important for suppression of lepidopteran pests in Brassica crops, particularly early in the season before parasitoids become established. Sampling was conducted in early season plantings of Brassicas in the Lockyer Valley (South East Queensland, Australia) in order to determine the most commonly occurring spider families. The most numerous were Theridiidae, which were more strongly associated with cauliflower and poorly associated with cabbage. The Lycosidae and Clubionidae/Miturgidae (formerly in the ‘catch-all’ family Clubionidae) also occurred commonly. Lycosidae (and to a lesser extent Salticidae) had above average abundance in Chinese cabbage and below average abundance in broccoli compared with average abundance for these spider families; Clubionidae/Miturgidae had above average abundance in cauliflower. Laboratory studies were then conducted to explore the predatory capacity of these three most commonly occurring spider families. All three were capable of feeding on larvae of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus), and cabbage <b>cluster</b> <b>caterpillar,</b> Crocidolomia pavonana (Fabricius), under laboratory conditions. Theridiidae, which {{are thought to}} prey on small pests such as leafhoppers and aphids, were able to successfully attack larvae up to five times their body size. Predation rates varied from an average of 1. 7 (SE[*]=[*] 0. 47) (1. 6 control corrected) larvae consumed over a 24 [*]h period in the case of the Theridiidae, to 3. 3 (SE[*]=[*] 0. 60) larvae for the Clubionidae/Miturgidae...|$|E
40|$|A Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in 30 farms in ten villages {{in different parts of}} Upolu Island of Western Samoa to ascertain the traditional sustainable methods of cultivation of taro (Colocasia esculenta). It was the major crop in a mixed cropping system under coconut. It was also grown extensively as a monocrop, mainly in areas where forests and abandoned bush land were cleared for planting. Few farmers used insecticides, but none used fungicides to control pests and diseases, respectively. <b>Cluster</b> <b>caterpillar</b> Spodoptera litura was the most serious pest. It was controlled by crushing the caterpillars and their egg masses and cutting and burning severely infected leaves. Corm rot by Pythium spp. caused considerable damage in the wet areas. It was controlled by uprooting the plants and destroying the infected corms and also by not planting in poorly drained soils. Several major species of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds were present. Herbicides were widely used. Most applied them two to three times after planting, while some removed weeds manually and used them as a mulch. Farmers owning large holdings fallow the land for 12 - 18 months, while many others used short fallows of six to eight months. A few carried out continuous cropping. Erythrina subumbrans was extensively used, mainly in areas where taro was grown as a monocrop, and the loppings were used as a mulch. The cation exchange capacity (CEC), calculated from the organic carbon content, was over 20 me/ 100 g soil. This indicated that the soil fertility is good. Inorganic fertilizers were not used by many farmers. Soil erosion was prevented by mulching and allowing tree trunks and branches to remain on the ground...|$|E
40|$|In 2003 the Collaboration on Insect Management for Brassicas in Asia and Africa (CIMBAA) public/private {{partnership}} {{selected the}} Cry 1 B/Cry 1 C Bt protein combination {{as having the}} potential to provide effective and sustainable control of diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella. Following transformations and extensive plant selection, insect efficacy trials were undertaken in 2008 to 2010 in north India (Murthal near New Delhi) and south India (near Bengaluru) in large scale screen-house experiments using artificial infestations on the best performing (Elite Event) plant lines and on hybrids produced from them. Plant damage was scored {{on a scale of}} 0 (no visible damage) to 4 (plant effectively destroyed). For DBM, cabbage <b>cluster</b> <b>caterpillar</b> (Crocidolomia binotalis), cabbage webworm (Hellula undalis) and semi-looper (Trichoplusia ni) there was zero insect survival and a zero damage score on the Elite Event lines and on their hybrids, while control plants had 50 to 100 % insect survival (depending on species, life stage and trials) and damage scores of 3. 3 to 4. Cabbage white (Pieris brassicae) and common army worm (Spodoptera litura) showed some larval survival and damage scores up to 1. 4 (especially in early trials) but no survival to pupation. Screening of DBM populations worldwide (inc. 18 populations for Cry 1 B and 13 for Cry 1 C from India) showed mean LC 50 s close to that of international susceptible strains. To date F 2 screening has not identified the presence of resistance genes in DBM in the field. Cry 1 B resistance was slowly developed artificially in the laboratory but 1 C resistance and resistance to the Cry 1 B/ 1 C combination was harder to develop and had higher fitness costs. The ‘resistant’ lines showed some extended survival of stunted DBM larvae on dual gene Bt plants but no survival to pupation. There was no cross-resistance between Cry 1 B and Cry 1 C. Resistance to both genes was autosomal and recessive. Beneficial insects were demonstrated to have the potential to provide additional mortality on rare surviving insects in Bt fields. Aphids were well controlled for the first 40 days post-transplanting using imidacloprid pelleted onto seed and, if necessary, by 1 - 2 Verticillium lecanii sprays thereafter. Surviving S. litura and Helicoverpa armigera in Bt sprayed fields were well controlled by one or two application...|$|E
