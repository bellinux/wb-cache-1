500|$|The punchbowls can be {{considered}} a harlequin pair as they are similar but not exactly matching. They are both Chinese ceramics ware of Cantonese origin, made of <b>clear</b> <b>glaze</b> on hard-paste porcelain and painted with polychrome famille rose overglaze enamel and gilding. They are similar in size, each approximately [...] in diameter, [...] high and weighing about , footring [...] high and [...] in diameter. Whilst the indigenous Australian groups painted within the inner centre of both bowls are identical, the outer panoramic views of Sydney Cove are not. The Library punchbowl has a view from the eastern side of Sydney Cove whilst the view on the Museum bowl is from Dawes Point on the western shore. This pairing follows a standard convention in late 18th-and early 19th-century topographical art of painting two views of the same scene from opposite vantage points.|$|E

50|$|The porch is entered on {{both sides}} via pointed arch openings. The {{building}} features sash lancet windows, most with <b>clear</b> <b>glazing,</b> and the rear gable has been clad in weatherboard and both gables have louvred vents to the ceiling space.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "blanks" [...] were plain white, with a <b>clear</b> <b>glaze,</b> {{and could}} be fired several times. Their price varied {{depending}} on size {{and complexity of the}} object's molding, ranging from a few cents to several dollars. The china painter could buy commercially produced powdered colors of mineral oxides mixed with a low-temperature flux.|$|E
2500|$|One common way to {{decorate}} the simplest of ceramic pieces in Oaxaca is called [...] "chorreada" [...] (runny). The pieces are first fired with a <b>clear</b> <b>glaze.</b> Then a second glaze with oxides for color are dabbed on and allowed to run where it may. This double glazing {{is similar to the}} production of 19th century Majolica, a pottery form more prominent in central Mexico. [...] The use of raised images on clay items has also been adapted to more traditional vessels, often with the image colored differently from the background.|$|E
2500|$|In San Miguel Allende, {{a kind of}} {{primitive}} folk pottery is sold in the town market. They are sauce dishes and bowls of a red tone with whimsical distorted animal figures in black (from copper oxide) under a poor <b>clear</b> <b>glaze.</b> These actually come from a small village outside of San Miguel. [...] A similar design is found in Coroneo, with the main difference being that the animal design is raised off {{the bottom of the}} vessel, which is produced by the mold. The raised design is painted black. While the features of the animals are not distorted, they are often given supernatural aspects, such as lions breathing fire.|$|E
25|$|The central chancel east {{window is}} of five lights, {{separated}} by transom; the ten segments rise to pointed arches with cinquefoilslobes {{formed by the}} overlapping of five circlesand spandrels. The chapel window to the north is of four lights, foiled and traceried, with a central quatrefoil rosette. The smaller chapel window to the south is of three lights and foiled. The chancel and south chapel east windows contain stained glass; the north chapel is <b>clear</b> <b>glazed.</b> All three windows are pointed-arched with hood moulds. The north chapel north wall contains three windows, one rectilinear centrally placed between two pointed arched. The windows are of three lights, <b>clear</b> <b>glazed,</b> and dressed with hood moulds. The south chapel south side contains two Tudor windows, both wider than high. The window to the east is of two sections, each with three lights with arched cinquefoil heads, and is <b>clear</b> <b>glazed.</b> The window to the west is of five lights, again with arched cinquefoil heads, but with panel tracery above. Both windows are dressed with flattened arch hood moulds with label stops. Beneath the west window is a flattened-arch door opening with oak-panelled iron-studded door set within.|$|R

2500|$|In {{about the}} 9th century, Chinese {{artisans}} abandoned the Han blue colour {{they had used}} for centuries, and began to use cobalt blue, made with cobalt salts of alumina, to manufacture fine blue and white porcelain, The plates and vases were shaped, dried, the paint applied with a brush, covered with a <b>clear</b> <b>glaze,</b> then fired at a high temperature. Beginning in the 14th century, this type of porcelain was exported in large quantity to Europe where it inspired a whole style of art, called Chinoiserie. [...] European courts tried {{for many years to}} imitate Chinese blue and white porcelain, but only succeeded in the 18th century after a missionary brought the secret back from China.|$|E
2500|$|Capula, a {{town near}} Morelia, {{produces}} a glazed ware {{that has become}} popular recently, and {{is now one of}} the most commonly found in popular arts stores in Mexico. [...] It typically has a painted design of small, formalized flowers made up of round dot petals painted in white slip on the natural red of the clay, then fired with a <b>clear</b> <b>glaze.</b> [...] The flowers may be limited to a band or applied lavishly over the entire piece. [...] The latter is frequently done with casseroles and flower pots. Forms include dishes, casseroles and flower pots. [...] More recently, potters from there have been experimenting with other designs, such as fish and birds made up of white or even colored dots such as blue, green or black. They are also modernizing their operation by introducing gas kilns and using a low-lead glaze.|$|E

50|$|The central hall, which {{measures}} approximately 15 m by 11 m, has a polished beech floor, and a double-pitched, timber-lined ceiling with exposed rafters. A valley beam running north-south has two intermediate chamfer post supports, and two timber ties run east-west. The southern gable ends are glazed with yellow patterned glass. Similarly patterned glass {{is used in}} the fanlights above doors opening onto the central hall. The doors have <b>clear</b> <b>glazed</b> panels.|$|R
50|$|The early lead-powder process led {{directly}} {{to the development of}} the tortoiseshell method and other coloured glazes which were used with the new fluid glazes. Here, patches of colour were sponged or painted onto the biscuit surface before a <b>clear</b> <b>glaze</b> was applied to the whole and then fired. Coloured decoration could help disguise imperfections that might arise during the firing process.|$|E
50|$|From {{the late}} 15th century, potters in Iznik began {{producing}} wares that were decorated in cobalt blue {{on a white}} fritware body under a <b>clear</b> <b>glaze.</b> Both the manufacturing technique and the underglaze designs were {{very different from that}} used in the production of Miletus ware. Fritware had been made in the Near East from the 13th century, but Iznik fritware, achieving a white surface, was a major innovation.|$|E
50|$|Shoki period soba-choko (1620-1720 - Genwa-Kyoho eras) {{generally}} featured poorer quality, often disfigured, thick {{sides and}} bases with oxide assuming a washed out appearance through thicker <b>clear</b> <b>glaze.</b> As the era progressed refinements and higher quality finishes become the norm. Traditional design were simple hand painted and also used stencils/stamping known as inban. The soba-choko was generally heavy in feel.

The clerestory parapet is of plain stone construction, overhangs the wall, and has a coped top.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of timber {{casement}} window, which are likely to be original. The only close-up photograph of the barracks was taken in 1984 when the property was purchased by its current owner. It is after this time that changes have been made to suit their personal requirements. The first window type is divided by mullions into four equal lights of mottled glazing. The second is divided in half, and then the upper section has two narrow lights in its lower half. These are <b>clear</b> <b>glazing</b> while the other two are mottled.|$|R
50|$|Raqqa's {{ceramics}} were {{varied in}} character, {{but have been}} identified during the 20th century by on-site excavations that securely linked the highly sought-after surviving pieces to Raqqa. Over a heavily potted body of coarse stone-paste often covered with a white slip, monochrome and polychrome underglaze stains of copper (turquoise), cobalt (blue) or manganese (purplish-brown) were covered with a greenish <b>clear</b> <b>glaze</b> and fired. Lustreware was also developed at Raqqa, after the Fatimid collapse in Egypt (1171), which until then {{had been the only}} center of lustreware production.|$|E
50|$|Parrish used {{many other}} {{innovative}} techniques in his paintings. He would {{take pictures of}} models {{in black and white}} geometric prints and project the image onto his works. This technique allowed for his figures to be clothed in geometric patterns, while accurately representing distortion and draping. Parrish would also create his paintings by taking pictures, enlarging, or projecting objects. He would cut these images out and put them onto his canvas. He would later cover them with <b>clear</b> <b>glaze.</b> Parrish's technique gave his paintings a more three-dimensional feel.|$|E
