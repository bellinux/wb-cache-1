5|$|Collybia cookei {{is found}} in Europe, Asia (Japan), and North America. The European {{distribution}} extends north to the Arctic Circle and the Lofoten Islands. The species is widely distributed in North America; it was reported from Mexico {{for the first time}} in 1998. The fungus is partial to mixed forest dominated by aspen and conifers in montane and subalpine environments. In The Netherlands, it was a component of one of three communities of saprobic fungi associated with roadside verges (the land between the road edge and the adjacent wall, fence or hedge) planted with <b>common</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus robur); the verges also supported the growth of the mushroom Russula ochroleuca, a host of C.cookei.|$|E

The Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) predominates over great expanses of the rocky heights and sheltered slopes. On moist shady slopes, normally facing north, or in sheltered places, the <b>common</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus robur) is widespread. In lowland areas and warm places the Cork oak (Quercus suber) is common and in limestone areas the Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea) is found. Other species scattered throughout the mountains of Sintra include: maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), common hazel (Corylus avellana), common hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), European holly (Ilex aquifolium), Portuguese laurel (Prunus lusitanica), Bay laurel (Laurus nobilis), [...] Strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), Laurestine (Viburnum tinus), Kermes oak (Quercus coccifera), and Italian buckthorn (Rhamnus alaternus). In the valleys, near watercourses, grow Narrow-leaf ash (Fraxinus angustifolia), Grey willow (Salix atrocinerea), European alder (Alnus glutinosa), Alder buckthorn (Rhamnus frangula) and Black Elderberry (Sambucus nigra).|$|E

50|$|The oblast's forest zone has two subzones: {{combined}} coniferous and broadleaved, and broadleaved forests. The combined subzone {{is dominated}} by various types of spruce forests.

Here, the edificatory species are <b>common</b> <b>oak,</b> tillet, taller ash, and elm trees. Unlike the coniferous forests, these are polydominant ones, with 7 to 8 layers. Usually there is birch and aspen in the second layer, with lowland maple, crab apple and field-ash in the third layer. There is also a well-developed layer of shrub.
