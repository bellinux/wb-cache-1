40|$|The Rocky Flats Closure Site is {{implementing}} {{an aggressive}} approach {{in an attempt}} to complete Site closure by 2006. The replanning effort to meet this goal required that the life-cycle decommissioning effort for the Site and for the major individual facilities be reexamined in detail. As part of the overall effort, the cost estimate for the Building 771 decommissioning project was revised to incorporate both actual cost data from a recently-completed similar project and detailed planning for all activities. This paper provides a brief overview of the replanning process and the original estimate, and then discusses the modifications to that estimate to reflect new data, methods, and planning rigor.

The United States National Academies identified several recommendations for the construction industry in 2009 to improve industry performance. One of the key recommendations was the development of reliable productivity measures to improve the efficiency and support of developing new construction innovations. Difficulty in mea-suring real output in the industry is a challenge that has prevented reliable productivity metrics. An alternative approach would be to consistently measure activity productivity across multiple construction projects through-out the United States and develop an aggregate measure accordingly.

40|$|Typical {{adults can}} track reward probabilities across trials to {{estimate}} the volatility {{of the environment and}} use this information to modify their learning rate (Behrens et al., 2007). In a stable environment, it is advantageous to take <b>account</b> <b>of</b> outcomes over many trials, whereas in a volatile environment, recent experience should be more strongly weighted than distant experience. Recent predictive <b>coding</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>of</b> autism propose that autistic individuals will demonstrate atypical updating of their behaviour in response to the statistics of the reward environment. To rigorously test this hypothesis, we administered a developmentally appropriate version of Behrens et al. 's (2007) task to 34 cognitively able children on the autism spectrum aged between 6 and 14 years, 32 age- and ability-matched typically developing children and 19 typical adults. Participants were required to choose between a green and a blue pirate chest, each associated with a randomly determined reward value between 0 and 100 points, with a combined total of 100 points. On each trial, the reward was given for one stimulus only. In the stable condition, the ratio of the blue or green response being rewarded was fixed at 75 : 25. In the volatile condition, the ratio alternated between 80 : 20 and 20 : 80 every 20 trials. We estimated the learning rate for each participant by fitting a delta rule model and compared this rate across conditions and groups. All groups increased their learning rate in the volatile condition compared to the stable condition. Unexpectedly, there was no effect of group and no interaction between group and condition. Thus, autistic children used information about the statistics of the reward environment to guide their decisions to a similar extent as typically developing children and adults.

These traits are then used to make inferences about that individual’s likely beliefs and desires, which in turn inform inferences about her behavior...|$|R
