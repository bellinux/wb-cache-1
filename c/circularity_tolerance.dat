40|$|Circular {{feature is}} one of the most common part {{features}} used in machines. Since it is practically impossible to make a part with perfect geometry, tolerances are specified to ensure the functionality of a final product while maintaining a low cost. This study presents fundamental treatments for <b>circularity</b> <b>tolerance</b> modeling, analysis, and design. First, a roundness profile model is presented. At present, the standard for geometric dimensioning and tolerancing, ASME Y 14. 5 M, specifies a <b>circularity</b> <b>tolerance</b> based on the tolerance zones defined by two concentric circular boundaries. To represent profile variation within the tolerance zones, a harmonic roundness model using Fourier series expansions is proposed. A cutting profile simulation model has also been developed to illustrate the relationship between the radial error motion of a machine tool spindle and the resultant part profiles. The profile model has been verified statistically by a large number of real profiles produced by turning and cylindrical grinding. Second, the effect of out-of-roundness on positioning accuracy is investigated for various cylindrical fit conditions. Analytical approaches and computer simulations are used together to facilitate more extensive investigations. Systematic procedures are also proposed for assigning <b>circularity</b> <b>tolerance</b> by prescribing a fit condition and a desirable process capability of assembly. As a result, new <b>circularity</b> <b>tolerance</b> guidelines are suggested for fit conditions. Third, the study is further extended to spindle design analysis. The geometrical accuracy of a machine tool spindle has been investigated to examine the effect of circularity and concentricity tolerance on spindle running accuracy. The study is verified through real spindle design data obtained from a custom-built Purdue High Speed Spindle. Finally, an experimental study is provided to verify the simulation routines used in the analysis of positioning accuracy. ...|$|E
40|$|Woven {{carbon fiber}} {{composites}} are being extensively used in aerospace, automotive and civil applications, owing to their high specific strength, higher fracture toughness, and drapeability {{as compared to}} unidirectional composites. The processing phase of composite manufacturing has a high added value to the processed laminate, so any damage during machining has a significant economical impact. However, the characteristic attributes like non-homogeneous structure, anisotropy and high abrasiveness of fibers coupled with non-optimized cutting parameters and tool wear can result in damage to the laminate. This experimental research involves quantifying the effect of processing parameters i. e. spindle speed, feed, and tool wear on hole quality during the drilling of a quasi-isotropic woven graphite fiber epoxy laminate. Drilling tests were conducted for wide range of spindle speeds (1, 500 rpm to 15, 000 rpm) and feed rates (20 μm/rev to 800 μm/rev) with a 5 mm diameter standard point tungsten carbide twist drill. This investigation extended the drilling approach to evaluate the benefits of high speed (12, 000 rpm and 15, 000 rpm) and high feed (600 - 800 μm/rev) regimes, which were not explored or reported in the open literature. Dependence of damage mechanisms; namely, delamination, fiber pull out, thermal damage, surface roughness deterioration, hole circularity and hole diameter errors, on cutting conditions was established. A strong correlation between different types of damages and cutting forces and temperature was also identified. High speed drilling approach produced contrasting results as spindle speed of 15, 000 rpm was found to reduce delamination damage and improve surface roughness but increase the hole circularity and diameter errors. Machinability maps were designed to illustrate the affect of cutting parameters on delamination damage, hole circularity, hole diameter error and hole surface roughness. The application of machinability maps as an aid for process engineers to avoid damage and optimize the process is demonstrated. Finally, {{it was concluded that}} the process could be controlled and delamination be eliminated by increasing the spindle speed up to 15, 000 rpm and feed rate up to 100 mum/rev. It results a higher productivity if a compromise on hole <b>circularity</b> and diameter <b>tolerances</b> is accepted. Having established the benefits of high speed and low feed drilling, tool wear was evaluated at 12, 000 rpm and 15, 000 rpm and optimal feed rate of 100 mum/rev. Chipping, abrasion and adhesion of carbon were found to be the main wear mechanisms. Abrasion at the flank face of the drills was identified to be the main wear process that controls the deterioration of the drill at high speeds. The three wear regimes i. e. primary, secondary, and tertiary, were found to strongly influence the thrust force, delamination damage, hole circularity, diameter error and hole surface roughness. Finally, the tool wear analysis revealed that a tool change strategy could be devised by monitoring the thrust force, rather than measuring the progression of flank wear...|$|R
