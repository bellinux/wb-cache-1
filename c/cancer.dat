Carcinogenicity is associated with tissue damage, and it is often viewed now as secondary to tissue damage.|$|E

40|$|Background: Diagnostic {{laparoscopy}} {{helps in}} diagnosing and staging Gastrointestinal (GI) <b>cancers.</b> Routine laparoscopy before laparotomy, especially in <b>cancers</b> that have equivocal operability, helps to avoid unnecessary laparotomies. Present study evaluates utility of laparoscopy in diagnosing and staging GI <b>cancers.</b> Materials and Methods: Diagnostic laparoscopy {{was done in}} 41 patients with gastrointestinal (GI) <b>cancers</b> who were thought to have equivocal operability. Patients with suspected or known non-metastatic GI <b>cancers,</b> in whom resectability was found doubtful by clinical assessment and pre-operative imaging, were included. Patients with non-GI <b>cancers</b> (lymphoma, gynaecologic <b>cancers,</b> genitourinary <b>cancers,</b> retroperitoneal sarcoma, sarcoma and abdominal metastasis of non-GI <b>cancers)</b> and metastatic <b>cancers</b> which were {{beyond the scope of}} curative surgery were excluded from the study. Results: After diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) five patients had benign diagnosis. Out of 36 patients with malignant diagnosis, after DL, 22 patients (61. 1 %) were inoperable, 11 patients (30. 6 %) were operable, and three (8. 3 %) patients were of equivocal operability. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of laparoscopy in detecting operability were 100 %, 91. 7 %, 81. 8 %, and 100 %, respectively. Conclusions: Laparoscopy helped in a significant number of patients with advanced GI <b>cancers</b> to avoid laparotomy. The morbidity of DL was acceptable...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Mismatch repair gene {{malfunction}} occurs {{early in}} the carcinogenesis of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal <b>cancers</b> (HNPCCs), leading to an accelerated accumulation of mutations and possibly to change in expression of cell cycle proteins. There is strong evidence that tumorigenesis in HNPCCs differs from sporadic ones. HNPCC-related endometrial <b>cancers</b> are less well studied. Our aim was to compare expression of cell cycle and apoptosis-related proteins in relation to proliferation and apoptosis in HNPCC-related and sporadic endometrial <b>cancers</b> to identify differences in their carcinogenetic pathways. Methods and results: Eighteen HNPCC-related endometrial <b>cancers,</b> each matched by tumour type, stage and grade with two sporadic endometrial <b>cancers,</b> were examined for proliferation, apoptosis and the expression of oestrogen and progesterone receptors, cyclin B 1, D 3 and E, p 21, p 27, bcl- 2, bax, p 53 and COX- 2. No differences in proliferation or apoptotic indices were detected between HNPCC-related and sporadic endometrial <b>cancers.</b> Cyclin B 1 expression was significantly higher in HNPCC-related <b>cancers</b> than in sporadic endometrial <b>cancers.</b> More HNPCC-related endometrial <b>cancers</b> had total loss of bax expression. Conclusions: Apart from differences in cyclin B 1 and bax expression, HNPCC-related and sporadic endometrial <b>cancers</b> are comparable. The subtle differences detected {{are consistent with the}} minor clinical diversity between HNPCC-related and sporadic endometrial <b>cancers...</b>|$|R

5|$|Genetic {{disorders}} {{can also}} cause endometrial <b>cancer.</b> Overall, hereditary causes contribute to 2â€“10% of endometrial <b>cancer</b> cases.

Women with Lynch syndrome have a 40â€“60%risk of developing endometrial <b>cancer,</b> higher than their risk of developing colorectal (bowel) or ovarian <b>cancer.</b> Ovarian and endometrial <b>cancer</b> develop simultaneously in 20% of people. Endometrial <b>cancer</b> nearly always develops before colon <b>cancer,</b> on average, 11years before. Carcinogenesis in Lynch syndrome comes from a mutation in MLH1 and/or MLH2: genes that participate {{in the process of}} mismatch repair, which allows a cell to correct mistakes in the DNA. Other genes mutated in Lynch syndrome include MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, which are also mismatch repair genes. Women with Lynch syndrome represent 2â€“3% of endometrial <b>cancer</b> cases; some sources place this as high as 5%. Depending on the gene mutation, women with Lynch syndrome have different risks of endometrial <b>cancer.</b> With MLH1 mutations, the risk is 54%; with MSH2, 21%; and with MSH6, 16%.|$|E
