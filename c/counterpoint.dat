5|$|After the fugato episode, the ritornello resumes {{for a third}} time, {{with the}} chorus singing a variant of their {{homophonic}} material {{with much of the}} <b>counterpoint</b> inverted; this time, however, there is no fugal episode inserted before the final two bar cadence.|$|E

5|$|Synge {{was educated}} privately at schools in Dublin and Bray, and later studied piano, flute, violin, music theory and <b>counterpoint</b> at the Royal Irish Academy of Music. He {{travelled}} {{to the continent}} to study music, but {{changed his mind and}} decided to focus on literature. He was a talented student and won a scholarship in <b>counterpoint</b> in 1891. The family moved to the suburb of Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire) in 1888, and Synge entered Trinity College, Dublin, the following year. He graduated with a BA in 1892, having studied Irish and Hebrew, as well as continuing his music studies and playing with the Academy Orchestra in the Antient Concert Rooms. Between November 1889 and 1894 he took private music lessons with Robert Prescott Stewart.|$|E
5|$|The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{following}} the Union of Lublin, became a <b>counterpoint</b> to the absolute monarchies gaining power in Europe. Its quasi-democratic political system of Golden Liberty, albeit limited to nobility, was mostly unprecedented {{in the history}} of Europe. In itself, it constituted a fundamental precedent for the later development of European constitutional monarchies.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of the bass part provides a motif for the continuo accompaniment, which is imitated in <b>counterpoint</b> by the two alto recorders {{until the end of}} the section, producing a running line of semiquavers. The accompanying oboes and upper strings respond to each other with fragmented quaver motifs derived from the vocal material of this section as well as the quaver motifs in the first section.|$|E

5|$|The fifth book {{looks more}} to the future; for example, Monteverdi employs the concertato style with basso continuo (a device that {{was to become a}} typical feature in the {{emergent}} Baroque era), and includes a sinfonia (instrumental interlude) in the final piece. He presents his music through complex <b>counterpoint</b> and daring harmonies, although at times combining the expressive possibilities of the new music with traditional polyphony.|$|E
5|$|The smaller, higher pitched gong, the thicker of the two, {{is called}} the panentekan by the Maguindanao and the p'malsan or pumalsan by the Maranao. Found on the player’s left, it is mainly played on the weaker double and triple beats of the rhythmic structure, in <b>counterpoint</b> to the pangandungan's part.|$|E
5|$|Elements of Tristano's early playing – <b>counterpoint,</b> reharmonizing, {{and strict}} time – {{influenced}} Miles Davis' Birth of the Cool, and the playing of saxophonist Gerry Mulligan and pianist Dave Brubeck. Tristano's early, more feelings-based performances also influenced {{the style of}} pianist Bill Evans, who also used overdubbing and multitracking in his own recordings after Tristano had experimented with the techniques. Avant garde musician Anthony Braxton has often mentioned Tristano {{and some of his}} students as influences.|$|E

5|$|Helped by a {{scholarship}} from {{the bishop of}} his home diocese, Fauré boarded at the school for 11 years. The régime was austere, the rooms gloomy, the food mediocre, and the required uniform elaborate. The musical tuition, however, was excellent. Niedermeyer, whose goal was to produce qualified organists and choirmasters, focused on church music. Fauré's tutors were Clément Loret for organ, Louis Dietsch for harmony, Xavier Wackenthaler for <b>counterpoint</b> and fugue, and Niedermeyer for piano, plainsong and composition.|$|E
5|$|Light {{falls on}} the {{pictorial}} space from the left, creating shadows against the back wall, the strongest cast by the girl's hennin. The depth of space provided by the back wall gives room for this detailing, which Charles Sterling believes is indebted to van Eyck. The light throws a murky but curved shadow {{on the wall behind}} the girl and acts as a <b>counterpoint</b> to the contour of her cheek and hairline.|$|E
5|$|Like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart before him, Mendelssohn was {{regarded}} as a child prodigy. He began taking piano lessons from his mother when he was six, and at seven was tutored by Marie Bigot in Paris. After the family moved to Berlin, all four Mendelssohn children studied piano with Ludwig Berger, who was himself a former student of Muzio Clementi. From at least May 1819 Felix (and his sister Fanny) studied <b>counterpoint</b> and composition with Carl Friedrich Zelter in Berlin. This was an important influence on his future career. Zelter had almost certainly been recommended as a teacher by his aunt Sarah Levy, who had been a pupil of W. F. Bach and a patron of C. P. E. Bach. Sarah Levy was a talented keyboard player in her own right, often playing with Zelter's orchestra at the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin, of which she and the Mendelssohn family were leading patrons. Sarah had formed an important collection of Bach family manuscripts which she bequeathed to the Singakademie; Zelter, whose tastes in music were conservative, was also an admirer of the Bach tradition. This undoubtedly played a significant part in forming Felix Mendelssohn's musical tastes. His works show his study of Baroque and early classical music. His fugues and chorales especially reflect a tonal clarity and use of <b>counterpoint</b> reminiscent of Johann Sebastian Bach, by whose music he was deeply influenced.|$|E

5000|$|The {{sound of}} the band was a mix of rock and pop, but also covered more {{progressive}} rock territory in songs like [...] "The Coming of Kohoutek", an instrumental from their Nexus album. When Ballard left the band after Encore, they took an even more progressive/fusion turn with their final Epic album Circus and then signed to a new record label (United Artists) for the final 1975 album <b>Counterpoints.</b> By 2005, all albums, including compilations, have been re-released on CD, except <b>Counterpoints.</b>|$|R

5|$|The cantata was {{commissioned}} by the minister {{of one of the}} churches in Mühlhausen, the city where Bach worked at the time. It was possibly written for a special occasion. The text is based on Luther's German version of Psalm 130 and also incorporates the words of a chorale. Bach's music integrates melodies from the chorale into larger structures. Bach also shows his interest in <b>counterpoint,</b> something which was characteristic of him throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|Tristano's {{second album}} for Atlantic was {{recorded}} in 1961 and released the following year. The New Tristano, as was stressed on the album cover, consisted entirely of piano solos and no overdubbing or tape-speed manipulation was employed. The tracks contain left-hand bass lines that provide structure to each performance as well as <b>counterpoint</b> for the right-hand playing; block chords, unclear harmonies and contrasting rhythms also appear. Other solo piano recordings that Tristano made in 1961 were not released until the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Captain Archibald Haddock (Capitaine Haddock in Hergé's {{original}} version) is a Merchant Marine sea {{captain and}} Tintin's best friend. Introduced in The Crab with the Golden Claws, Haddock is initially {{depicted as a}} weak and alcoholic character, but later evolves to become genuinely heroic and even a socialite after he finds a treasure from his ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock (Chevalier François de Hadoque in the original version). The Captain's coarse humanity and sarcasm act as a <b>counterpoint</b> to Tintin's often-implausible heroism; he is always quick with a dry comment whenever the boy reporter seems too idealistic. After he and Tintin find Red Rackham's treasure, Captain Haddock lives in the luxurious mansion Marlinspike Hall (Le château de Moulinsart in the original French).|$|E

5|$|In 1919, {{at the age}} of thirteen, he {{was allowed}} to enter the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who {{monitored}} Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him. Shostakovich studied piano with Leonid Nikolayev after a year in the class of Elena Rozanova, composition with Maximilian Steinberg, and <b>counterpoint</b> and fugue with Nikolay Sokolov, with whom he became friends. Shostakovich also attended Alexander Ossovsky's history of music classes. Steinberg tried to guide Shostakovich {{in the path of the}} great Russian composers, but was disappointed to see him 'wasting' his talent and imitating Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev. Shostakovich also suffered for his perceived lack of political zeal, and initially failed his exam in Marxist methodology in 1926. His first major musical achievement was the First Symphony (premiered 1926), written as his graduation piece {{at the age of}} nineteen.|$|E
5|$|In England, ruined medieval castles became fashionable {{again in}} the middle of the 18th century. They were {{considered}} an interesting <b>counterpoint</b> to Palladian classical architecture, and gave a degree of medieval allure to their owners. Some keeps were modified to exaggerate this effect: Hawarden, for example, was remodelled to appear taller but also more decayed, the better to produce a good silhouette. The interest continued and, in the late 18th and 19th century, it became fashionable to build intact, replica castles in England, resulting in what A. Rowan has called the Norman style of new castle building, characterised by the inclusion of large keeps; the final replica keep to be built in this way was at Penrhyn between 1820 and 1840.|$|E
5|$|In September 1928 Britten went as a boarder to Gresham's School, in Holt, Norfolk. At {{the time}} he felt unhappy there, even writing in his diary of contemplating suicide or running away: he hated being {{separated}} from his family, most particularly from his mother; he despised the music master; and he was shocked at the prevalence of bullying, though {{he was not the}} target of it. He remained there for two years and in 1930, he won a composition scholarship at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London; his examiners were the composers John Ireland and Ralph Vaughan Williams and the college's harmony and <b>counterpoint</b> teacher, S P Waddington.|$|E
