40|$|The patient, a 45 {{year old}} woman, {{underwent}} routine bi-annual mammography. Imaging Findings The patient underwent a routine mammographic examination. In the <b>cranio-caudal</b> <b>projection,</b> several ring like structures are seen bilaterally projecting over the breasts, {{mainly in the}} outer regions, and they appear in larger number on the left side. No such images were seen on the oblique views, thus posing the suspicion of an artifact. Clinical examination of the patient, and interrogation of the radiographer who perfomed the examination, allowed {{to find out the}} cause of this artifact. The patient's curly hair, quite long and somehow difficult to control, had fallen between the x-ray tube and the film holder, thus causing the artifact...|$|E
30|$|Screening {{mammography}} is a standardised procedure {{composed of}} four views (also named projections), two for each breast: the <b>cranio-caudal</b> <b>projection</b> and the medio-lateral oblique projection. In some countries, clinical breast examination {{is a part}} of the procedure, even though its added value in the screening setting, when mammography is performed, is negligible [4]. Screening mammography can be performed by a radiographer alone; the resulting images are usually read by two radiologists, independently, in separate sessions. If the examination is judged to not reveal any abnormality suspicious for malignancy, the woman receives a letter communicating this result. If something suspicious is found, the woman is recalled for a tailored further assessment that can be variably composed of additional mammographic views, tomosynthesis, ultrasound, MRI, CESM or needle biopsy. When this assessment is concluded, a formal written report will be prepared by the radiologist and given to the woman during a dedicated interview for complete information.|$|E
40|$|Mammography {{is used as}} a {{screening}} tool for early detection of breast cancer. However, the radiation dose used should be as low as possible to minimize any effects on asymptomatic woman while maintaining the diagnostic value of the image as mammography is done annually. This study was done to determine the optimum exposure parameter in exposure control mode (AEC) for two combinations of anode/filter which were molybdenum/molybdenum (Mo/Mo) and molybdenum/rhodium (Mo/Rh) using the Lorad Selenia digital mammography system at the Womenâ€™s Breast Clinic, National Cancer Society (NCS). A CIRS 012 A mammography research of phantom 4 cm thickness with 50 % glandularity was exposed in the <b>cranio-caudal</b> <b>projection.</b> TLD 100 H was used to measure the entrance surface air kerma (ESAK). The AGD values were then calculated from the ESAK values, incorporating three correction factors (g, c and s) according to Euref protocol. Image quality was evaluated using signal to noise ratio (SNR). Figure of Merit (FOM) which is the ratio of the square of SNR to the AGD shows that 30 kVp is the optimum exposure parameter for a 4 cm thickness phantom with the use of Mo/Rh and Mo/Mo anode/filter combination. Non-parametric Spearman correlation test showed a negative linear relationship between AGD and SNR with increasing tube voltage for both anode/filters...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of mammography equipment {{made it possible}} {{to reduce the amount of}} radiation necessary for mammography exams. On the other hand the demands on image resolution have been growing, which means that the average amount of radiation has actually increased. It is necessary to decrease the irradiation amount during screening as much as possible without jeopardising image quality. When using a modern mammography system, the medium dose of irradiation absorbed by the gland is approximately 1 [...] 1. 5 mGy for each picture. Patients can undergo as many as 25 mammography exams in their lifetime and therefore it is necessary to reduce the irradiation to an acceptable minimum. In 1631 patients underoing mammography screening, the following relations for the <b>cranio-caudal</b> <b>projection</b> of the left Braest were evaluated: the dependence of a mean mammary gland dose on the compressed Brest thickness and on mAs. The largest group in the monitored set was between 50 [...] 54 years of age and the age of the mammography screening clients examined for the first time was between 45 [...] 49 years. In my work I recommended a program for the calculation of glandular irradiation, which is available on the Internet for free and I did not detect elevated "diagnostic reference levels. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to measure the radiation dose and image quality in conventional screen-film mammography and full-field digital mammography in women referred to mammography examination. Participants underwent bilateral, two-view screen-film mammography or full-field digital mammography. The visibility of anatomical regions and overall clinical image quality was rated by experienced radiologists. Total of 387 women and 1548 mammograms were enrolled in the study. Image quality was assessed in terms of image quality score, whereas patient dose assessment was performed in terms of mean glandular dose. Average mean glandular dose for <b>cranio-caudal</b> <b>projection</b> was 1. 5 mGy and 2. 1 mGy in full-field digital mammography and screen-film mammography, respectively. For medio-lateral oblique projection, corresponding values were 2. 3 and 2. 1 mGy. Overall image quality criteria scoring was 0. 82 and 0. 99 for screen-film and digital systems, respectively. The scores were in the range from 0. 11 to 1. 0 for different anatomical structures. Overall, full-field digital mammography was superior both in terms of image quality and dose over the screen-film mammography. The results have indicated that phantom dose values can assist in setting the optimisation activities in mammography and for comparison between mammography units. To obtain accurate diagnostic information with an acceptable radiation dose to breast, it is necessary to periodically perform patient dose and image quality surveys in all mammography units...|$|E
30|$|There {{are some}} {{limitations}} to our study {{that must be}} considered. The high exclusion percentage for technical problems (50 %) is as a limitation of the current optical imaging procedure investigated herein. However, technological improvements are being continually developed {{to reduce the number}} of eliminations. Particularly in the early phase of the study, we had several technical failures mainly due to the use of ComfortScan hardware, which is an evolving digital optical scanner. Breast imaging was acquired only in <b>cranio-caudal</b> <b>projection,</b> which may cause an underdetection of lesions localized in the axillary pilaster and/or mammary sulcus. Moreover, DeHCA optical image processing was not feasible in some women with very small, firm breasts that could not be properly illuminated as well as in women previously submitted to surgery and/or bioptic procedures due to the presence of residual edema and extravasation. The possible limiting role of factors like inflammatory breast conditions, skin breast tattoos, menstrual cycle phases, and vasculitis in the appropriate DeHCA optical image processing should be addressed in appropriate trials. The overall disease prevalence in our series, and the high number of malignant versus benign lesions among the positive cases, is not truly representative of the female population normally investigated in a screening breast imaging center. This was due to the second level nature of our cancer center and to the need to have a pathological standard reference available for the study purposes. In addition, not all cases had both mammography and US available. Finally, it must also be considered that we used film-screen mammography, which is no longer considered the state-of-the art technique, despite still being utilized in many screening programs.|$|E
40|$|This {{experimental}} {{study investigated the}} effect of kVp variation on image quality and dose. This study also identified the significance difference in image quality and dose between Mo/Mo and Mo/Rh combination, and also the significance difference in image quality and dose between different AOP. CIRS 012 A and PMMA breast phantom (4 cm, 5 cm and 6 cm thickness) were used as subject. Study was done at Pantai Hospital Kuala Lumpur using Senographe Essential FFDM and Diamond GE system. TLD chip was used as dose measurement tool. Exposures were taken using Mo/Mo combination (26 kVp, 28 kVp and 30 kVp) and Mo/Rh combination (28 kVp, 30 kVp and 32 kVp) in <b>cranio-caudal</b> <b>projection</b> using AEC and AOP mode. SPSS 21. 0 was used as statistical tool. Criteria of image quality assessment were adapted from ACR 1999, Mammography QC. 2 experienced radiographer with at least 10 years of working experience in performing mammography scored the image independently. Kappa finds a good agreement between raters (kappa value= 0. 9, p 0. 05). Independent t-test had shown {{a significant difference in}} dose value between Mo/Mo and Mo/Rh for 4 cm breast thickness (p= 0. 046). However, there is no significant difference between Mo/Mo and Mo/Rh combination in image quality (p> 0. 05). One way ANOVA showed a significant difference in dose between CNT and DOSE in AOP mode (p= 0. 013). However, there is no significant difference in image quality between CNT, DOSE and STD (p> 0. 05). Study finds that 30 kVp in Mo/Rh is the optimum exposure factor to be used regardless of breast thickness. STD and DOSE mode is the preferred selection in optimizing between dose and image quality...|$|E
