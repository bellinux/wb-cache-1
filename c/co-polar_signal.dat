40|$|A medium-size Beacon Receiving System for {{reception}} and processing of the B 1 (20 GHz) and B 2 (30 GHz) beacons from Olympus has been developed. Integration of B 1 and B 2 receiving equipment into one system using one antenna {{and a common}} computer for control and data processing provides the advantages of a compact configuration and synchronization of the two receiver chains. Range for <b>co-polar</b> <b>signal</b> attenuation meaurement is about 30 dB for both beacons, increasing to 40 dB for B 2 if the receivers are synchronized to B 1. The accuracy is better than 0. 5 dB. Cross-polarization discriminations {{of the order of}} 10 to 30 dB may be determined with an accuracy of 1 to 2 dB. A number of radiometers for complementary measurements of atmospheric attenuation of 13 to 30 GHz has also been constructed. A small multi-frequency system for operation around 22 GHz and 31 GHz is presently under development...|$|E
40|$|The first-ever dual-frequency multi-constellation Global Navigation Satellite Systems Reflectometry (GNSS-R) polarimetric {{measurements}} over {{boreal forests}} and lakes from the stratosphere are presented. Data were {{collected during the}} European Space Agency (ESA) sponsored Balloon Experiments for University Students (BEXUS) 19 stratospheric balloon experiment using the P(Y) and C/A Reflect Ometer (PYCARO) instrument operated in closed-loop mode. Maps of the polarimetric ratio for L 1 and L 2 Global Positioning System (GPS) and GLObal Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS), and for E 1 Galileo signals are derived from the float phase at 27, 000 m height, and the specular points are geolocalized on the Earth’s surface. Polarimetric ratio () maps over boreal forests are shown {{to be in the}} range 2 – 16 dB for the different GNSS codes. This result suggests that the scattering is taking place not only over the soil, but over the different forests elements as well. Additionally to the interpretation of the experimental results a theoretical investigation of the different contributions to the total reflectivity over boreal forests is performed using a bistatic scattering model. The simulated cross- (reflected Left Hand Circular Polarization LHCP) and co-polar (reflected Right Hand Circular Polarization RHCP) reflectivities are evaluated for the soil, the canopy, and the canopy–soil interactions for three different biomass densities: 725 trees/ha, 150 trees/ha and 72 trees/ha. For elevation angles larger than the Brewster angle, it is found that the cross-polar signal is dominant when just single reflections over the forests are evaluated, while in the case of multiple reflections the <b>co-polar</b> <b>signal</b> becomes the largest one.

40|$|Usually common polarimetric {{weather radar}} DSP-products (e. g. : reflectivity, {{differential}} reflectivity, linear depolarisation ratio - for both - <b>co-polar</b> and cross-polar <b>signal</b> components) {{are based on}} the logarithmic receiver output, because of the large dynamic range provided by the logarithmic receiver. In this paper {{for the first time we}} also use the linear receiver output to calculate common weather radar DSP-Products. Using the raw time series radar data recorded with the coherent polarimetric C-band weather radar of the DLR (''Poldirad'', Wessling, Germany) it is possible to do a comparison between processed weather radar echoes from the linear receiver and the logarithmic receiver. After the comparison showed very good results, we continued the work with the linear receiver data, especially on the topic named temporal decorrelation properties of the linear receiver data. This paper includes the first results obtained from two observables that belong to our working topic. The first observable is the ''Time Decorrelation Factor-TDF'' and the second one is the ''Decorrelation Time DTτ''The results have been summarised in the form of empirical relationships, plots and the least mean square (LMS) method of curve fitting was used to give the mathematical relationship for the observables TDF and DTτ. Generally, the paper will also reflect on the statistical properties of radar echoes measured with linear receivers. The usage of the linear receiver data opens a wide field of new applications and products for the work with polarimetric weather radar data, because the linear receiver data also provides phase information which a logarithmic receiver does not...|$|R
