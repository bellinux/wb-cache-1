25|$|In Orthodox Judaism, men {{and women}} are not allowed to mingle during prayer services, and Orthodox synagogues {{generally}} include a divider, called a mechitza, creating separate men's and women's sections. This idea comes from the old Jewish practice during the times of the temple in Jerusalem when there was a women's balcony in the Ezrat Nashim to separate the male and female spectators at the special Succot celebrations. There is also a prophecy in Zechariah (Zechariah 12:12) that talks about {{men and women}} mourning separately. The Talmud took this account and inferred that if men and women should be separate in times of mourning, then they <b>certainly</b> <b>should</b> be separate in times of happiness.|$|E

At the time, Watson said: [...] "We feel [...] is a very solid company with plenty of capacity to withstand whatever happens the next few months." [...] One analyst called the deal [...] "a whopper [...] a very good deal financially, <b>certainly</b> <b>should</b> be a good deal strategically, and provides some immediate balance-sheet backstop for Enron." ...|$|E
500|$|In December, Vilsack {{embarked}} on a campaign tour beginning {{in his hometown of}} Pittsburgh. While there, he addressed a local Democratic Committee, reminiscing about his childhood and how his adopted mother overcame alcoholism. He also discussed his policy on the Iraq War, advocating devolving control to the Iraqi government: [...] "It's their country, it's their future and they should be willing to fight for it and they <b>certainly</b> <b>should</b> be willing to die for it." [...] He returned to Iowa for a fundraiser later in the week.|$|E

2500|$|The Sydney Cricket Ground had an outfield {{of thick}} grass {{which made it}} very {{difficult}} to score boundaries. The mighty Macartney had only five fours in his hundred (two of which were all run), yet Callaway hit 26 fours. The Sydney Morning Herald conjectured that if the ground was in its normal condition, he would have made another 50. [...] "He <b>certainly</b> <b>should</b> rise to great heights", the paper concluded, [...] "all going well with him".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the final}} {{interview}} he ever gave, in August 1970, Goddard told David Yallop that being Lord Chief Justice {{was not an}} easy job. When Yallop, who believed that Craig should have been imprisoned for manslaughter and Bentley thus cleared, asked Goddard about Derek Bentley's execution, he received the following reply, [...] "Yes, I thought that Bentley was going to be reprieved. He <b>certainly</b> <b>should</b> have been. There's {{no doubt in my mind}} whatsoever that Bentley should have been reprieved".|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{position}} on implementing the Tenth Amendment, Paul explained, [...] "Certain medical procedures and medical choices, I would allow the states to determine that. The state law should prevail not the Federal Government." [...] Speaking specifically about Drug Enforcement Administration raids on medical marijuana clinics Paul said, [...] "They're unconstitutional", {{and went on to}} advocate states' rights and personal choice: [...] "You're not being compassionate by taking medical marijuana from someone who's suffering from cancer or AIDS ... People should have freedom of choice. We <b>certainly</b> <b>should</b> respect the law and the law says that states should be able to determine this." ...|$|E

Hillary lacks judgement and will push the United States into endless, stupid wars which spread terrorism. ...she <b>certainly</b> <b>should</b> not become president of the United States." [...] On 25 July, following the Republican National Convention (RNC), during an interview by Amy Goodman, Assange said that choosing between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is like choosing between cholera or gonorrhea. [...] "Personally, I would prefer neither." [...] WikiLeaks editor, Sarah Harrison, has stated that the site is not choosing which damaging publications to release, rather releasing information that is available to them.|$|E
2500|$|Harris holds nuanced {{views about}} Israel and Judaism. He has said, [...] "I don't think Israel should {{exist as a}} Jewish state. I think it is obscene, irrational and unjustifiable to have a state {{organized}} around a religion. So I don't celebrate the idea that there's a Jewish homeland in the Middle East. I certainly don't support any Jewish claims to real estate based on the Bible. Though I just said that I don't think Israel should exist as a Jewish state, the justification for such a state is rather easy to find. We {{need look no further}} than the fact that the rest of the world has shown itself eager to murder the Jews at almost every opportunity. So, if there were going to be a state organized around protecting members of a single religion, it <b>certainly</b> <b>should</b> be a Jewish state. Now, friends of Israel might consider this a rather tepid defense, but it's the strongest one I've got. I think the idea of a religious state is ultimately untenable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Demetrius Charles de Kavanagh Boulger stated at {{the time}} that the {{strength}} of the Qing has been thoroughly demonstrated and that her prestige remained unsullied. [...] "Whatever danger there may be to the permanence of Qing's triumph lies rather from Russia than from the peoples of Tian Shan Nan Lu; nor is there much danger that the Chinese laurels will become faded even before a European foe. Zuo Zongtang and his generals such as Jin Shun and Chang Yao, accomplished a task which would reflect credit on any army and any country. They have given a luster to the modern Chinese administration which must stand it in good stead, and they have acquired a personal renown that will not easily depart. The Qing reconquest of Xinjiang is beyond doubt the most remarkable event that has occurred in Asia during the last fifty years, and it is quite the most brilliant achievement of a Chinese army, led by Chinese generals, that has taken place since the Qianlong Emperor subdued the country more than a century ago. It also proves, in a manner that is more than unpalatable to us, that the Chinese possess an adaptive faculty that must be held to be a very important fact in every-day politics in Central Asia. They reconquered Kashgaria with European weapons and by careful study of Western science and technology. Their soldiers marched in obedience to instructors trained on the Prussian principle; and their generals maneuvered their troops in accordance with the teachings of Moltke and Manteuffel. Even in such minor matters as the use of telescopes and field glasses we could find this Chinese army well supplied. Nothing was more absurd than the picture drawn by some over-wise observer of this army, as consisting of soldiers fantastically garbed in the guise of dragons and other hideous appearances. All that belonged to an old-world theory. The rebel troops were as widely different from all previous Chinese armies in Central Asia as it well could be; and in all essentials closely resembled that of a European power. Its remarkable triumphs were chiefly attributable to the thoroughness with which China had in this instance adapted herself to Western notions". [...] "But, although our hands are tied in Central Asia, they are not fettered at Pekin, and we <b>certainly</b> <b>should</b> congratulate, if we have not done so already, the Chinese on their remarkable successes in the Tian Shan regions. That step might be pregnant with beneficent results, and our desire to be on good terms with our new, yet our old, neighbour might be met in a cordial manner by the Chinese." ...|$|E
