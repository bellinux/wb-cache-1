2500|$|Co-infection with {{hookworm}} and Plasmodium falciparum {{is common}} in Africa. Although exact numbers are unknown, preliminary analyses estimate {{that as many as}} a quarter of African schoolchildren (17.8–32.1 million children aged 5–14 years) may be coincidentally at-risk of both P. falciparum and hookworm. While original hypotheses stated that co-infection with multiple parasites would impair the host’s immune response to a single parasite and increase susceptibility to clinical disease, studies have yielded <b>contrasting</b> <b>results.</b> For example, one study in Senegal showed that the risk of clinical malaria infection was increased in helminth-infected children in comparison to helminth-free children while other studies have failed to reproduce such results, and even among laboratory mouse experiments the effect of helminths on malaria is variable. Some hypotheses and studies suggest that helminth infections may protect against cerebral malaria due to the possible modulation of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines responses. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying this supposed increased susceptibility to disease are unknown. For example, helminth infections cause potent and highly polarized immune response characterized by increased T-helper cell type 2 (Th2) cytokine and Immunoglobulin E(IgE) production. [...] However, the effect of such responses on the human immune response is unknown. Additionally, both malaria and helminth infection can cause anemia, but the effect of co-infection and possible enhancement of anemia is poorly understood.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{researchers}} {{have argued that}} catastrophic interference {{is not an issue}} with the backpropagation model of human memory.

Thus, they concluded that catastrophic interference is not limited to connectionist memory models but rather that it is a [...] "general product of pattern-based learning that occurs in humans as well" [...] (p. 272).

50|$|Because much {{research}} on language processing {{has centered on}} English and other alphabet languages, many theories of language processing have stressed the role of phonology (see for instance WEAVER++) in producing speech. Contrasting logographic languages, where a single character is represented phonetically and ideographically, with phonetic languages has yielded insights into how different languages rely on different processing mechanisms. Studies on the processing of logographic languages have amongst other things looked at neurobiological differences in processing, with one area of particular interest being hemispheric lateralization. Since logographic languages are more closely associated with images than alphabet languages, several researchers have hypothesized that right-side activation should be more prominent in logographic languages. Although some studies have yielded results consistent with this hypothesis {{there are too many}} <b>contrasting</b> <b>results</b> to make any final conclusions about the role of hemispheric lateralization in orthographic versus phonetic languages.|$|E

50|$|Polling by Maurice de Hond {{published}} in March 2009 {{indicated that the}} PVV {{was the most popular}} parliamentary party.

If the polling results were to be replicated at a genuine election, Wilders would be a major power broker and could become Prime Minister. However, De Hond's results were not uncontroversial, as they were based on a panel of people who have signed up for the election poll on the Internet and thus were not a random sample. According to Joop van Holsteyn, professor of election research, therefore, De Hond's polls were not representative of the population.

Instead what has happened is repeated optimism and failure, the big name signings and returns of the likes of Dale Lambert, Mike Bishop and Ron Shudra failing to compensate the constant name changes and poor league positions that until recently had become near permanent.

Buildings certified under LEED do not have to prove energy or water efficiency in practice to receive LEED certification points, but instead LEED uses modeling software to predict future energy use based on intended use. This has led to criticism of LEED’s ability to accurately determine the efficiency of buildings.

50|$|There is {{substantial}} interest into the robustness of pollination networks to species loss and collapse, especially due to anthropogenic {{factors such as}} habitat destruction. The structure of a network is thought to affect how long {{it is able to}} persist after species decline begins. In particular, the nested structure of networks has been shown to protect against complete destruction of the network, because the core group of generalists are the most robust to extinction by habitat loss. Models specifically focused on the effects of habitat loss have shown that specialist species tend to go extinct first, while the last species to go extinct are the most generalized of the network. Other studies focusing specifically on the removal of different types of species showed that species decline is the fastest when removing the most generalized species. However, there have been <b>contrasting</b> <b>results</b> on how rapidly decline occurs with removal of these species. One study showed that even at the fastest rate, the decline was still linear. Another study revealed that with the removal of the most common pollinator species, the network showed a drastic collapse. In addition to focusing on the removal of species themselves, other work has emphasized the importance of studying the loss of interactions, as this will often precede species loss and may well accelerate the rate at which extinction occurs.|$|E
