40|$|We have {{conducted}} {{a series of}} experiments at the KMS CHROMA facility using dot spectroscopy techniques to characterize uncertainties associated with spectral line ratio models commonly applied in determining electron temperatures and densities. Temperatures determined from the slope of the H-like free-bound continuum and densities via holographic interferometry, are compared to line ratio methods. Dot targets of (typically 100 μmD Mg or Al) are irradiated with 2 to 40 x 1013 W/cm 2 of 0. 53 μm light. Time and spatial gradients are resolved using 4 diagnostics: a 4 -frame holographic interferometer, an x-ray streak <b>crystal</b> <b>spectrograph</b> with a spatial imaging slit, a framing crystal x-ray spectrometer, and a conventional space-resolved time-integrating <b>crystal</b> <b>spectrograph</b> used for survey and calibration purposes. Preliminary results indicate the ionization distribution of these laser produced plasmas is not steady-state which {{plays an important role in}} measuring the temperature and and density. Electron temperatures derived from line-ratio techniques, assuming steady state conditions, disagree dramatically from simultaneous measurements using the slope of the H-like continuum. Electron densities using He-like triplet to singlet line ratios also differ from densities measured interferometrically...|$|E

40|$|International audienceX-ray {{spectra of}} highly-ionized xenon and krypton {{measured}} in a laser-irradiated gas jet {{are presented with}} a main purpose of line identification. The spectral range of 0. 5 to 1 nm was covered using two flat Bragg <b>crystal</b> <b>spectrographs.</b> The very rich spectra of xenon cover the transitions 3 p–nd and 3 d–nf, with n = 5 to 10, of Xe 26 + to Xe 30 + (Ni-like to Cr-like). Transitions 2 p–nd and 2 s–np with n = 3, 4 of Kr 24 + to Kr 28 + (Mg-like to O-like) have also been recorded, in a range covering some unidentified lines. Ab initio detailed calculations performed with the RELAC code have permitted to identify lines of Xe and Kr, including transitions which were measured but not identified until now.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{diagnostics}} utilizing the radiation emitted from high-temperature plasmas {{have been developed}} at Los Alamos. Photoemissive x-ray diodes with photon energy bandpass filters provide time resolved rough spectral data from bout 6 eV to > 10 keV photon energy. Filtered silicon photodiodes can be used down to 1 eV and offer the advantages of nominally flat response and ability to operate in poor vacuum conditions. Both types of diodes will provide a rough time resolved spectrum and both are relatively inexpensive, reliable, and passive (i. e. no synchronization problems). For higher energy resolution bent <b>crystal</b> <b>spectrographs</b> {{are used in the}} x-ray region. With the addition of streak cameras or gated microchannel plates these systems provide data with high energy and high time resolution. To measure the total energy output a thin foil bolometer is used that measures the change in foil resistance as it is heated by the plasma radiation. Information on the physical location of the plasma is provided by a suite of visible framing cameras and x-ray pinhole cameras. By combining these diagnostics into a complementary set good diagnostic information can be guaranteed on any plasma experiment...|$|R

The plot between the observed shifts {{and the number of}} covalently bonded electrons (calculated using a semi-empirical metallic radii formalism due to Pauling) suggests a definite correlation. This plot is then used to obtain the number of covalently bonded electrons of cobalt in TmCo 5 and YCo 5 for which the self-consistent radii data is not available. Useful conclusions are obtained about chemical bonding in these two compounds...|$|E

The present paper describes the calculation of ray paths through the spectrograph for both localized and extended sources. The method traces a ray from any given source point to its point of diffraction by the curved crystal {{and then to the}} imaging circle, where the image point is obtained. Application of the ray tracing method is made to some actual experimental configurations to obtain resolution values and source sizes.

40|$|Experiments are {{reported}} in which the inert gases argon and neon were subjected to a high-voltage electrodeless discharge. The characteristics of the discharge were studied, and a theory of the mechanism of origin of the emitted x-radiation is proposed. The construction of a composite X-ray, incorporating both orthodox electrodes and an electrodeless discharge tube is described. This involved {{the building of a}} vacuum evaporating unit. Details are given of the construction of a photographically recording bent <b>crystal</b> vacuum <b>spectrograph.</b> Using a mica crystal, the working range of the instrument is about 5 - 19 kX in the first order of reflection, the inverse linear dispersion being about 37 X/mm at 15 kX. A spectroscopic analysis of the X-radiation emitted by the inert gas neon is described. Twenty-one K-series lines were recorded, many of them for the first time. The majority of the lines have been identified and the wavelengths measured in all cases.

40|$|Space-resolved {{spectra of}} line-shaped laser-produced {{magnesium}} plasmas {{in the normal}} direction of the target have been obtained using a pinhole <b>crystal</b> <b>spectrograph.</b> These spectra are treated by a spectrum analyzing code for obtaining the true spectra and fine structures of overlapped lines. The spatial distributions of electron temperature and density along the normal direction of the target surface have been obtained with different spectral diagnostic techniques. Especially, the electron density plateaus beyond the critical surface in line-shaped magnesium plasmas have been obtained with a fitting technique applied to the Stark-broadened Ly-alpha wings of hydrogenic ions.

High Z K-shell spectra emitted from slab targets heated to near 10 {sup 17 } W cm{sup {minus} 2 } intensity are investigated. High resolution ({gamma}/{Delta}{gamma}> 5000) x-ray spectra of multicharged ions of H-like Ti, Co, Ni, Cu, and also H-like Sc in the spectral range 1. 5 [...] 3. 0 {angstrom} are obtained in single laser shots using a spherically bent Mica <b>crystal</b> <b>spectrograph</b> with a 186 mm radius of curvature.

40|$|The mass {{ablation}} {{rate has}} been measured using the 12 -beam GEKKO XII glass laser. An X-ray pinhole camera coupled to a streak camera {{was used to}} provide both spatial and temporal history of the emission from buried maker layers. The camera was filtered by 0. 75 μm of Al to enhance {{the image of the}} cool, denser plasma near the ablation front. The targets (diameter approximately 500 μm) were both polymer shells and solid polymer pellets and were overcoated with up to four maker layers sandwiched between CH ablator layers. Laser energies of up to 8 kJ in 1. 7 ns were incident on the targets, with absorbed irradiances of up to 4. 0 × 1014 W-cm- 2. Good agreement has been found between the experiment and a one-dimensional hydrodynamic code in which the heat flow is obtained from the Fokker-Planck equation. The mass data were consistent with the temporal behavior of spectral line emissions observed by a streaked <b>crystal</b> <b>spectrograph.</b> The introduction of random phase plates had no significant influence on the mass ablation rate for imploding targets. The results indicate that a highly uniform drive pressure has been achieved for the GEKKO XII laser...|$|E

The 'thin' and 'thick' target M emission spectra f and the Miv, v absorption spectra of the elements Europium, Gadolinium and Terbium (in {{the form of the}} oxide) have been photographed. Attempts to record the M i, ii, iii absorption edges of Gadolinium and Terbium are also described. The Miv, v absorption spectra of Europium and Terbium (in the form of the fluoride) and Samarium, Gadolinium, Terbium and Ytterbium (in the form of the metals) have been photographed. The observed duality of the Miv, v absorption spectrum of Europium has been explained. Prom the results obtained in the present investigation, it has been possible to complete observations on the M spectra of the rare earth elements. The correspondence between the spectral components of the M emission and absorption spectra has been demonstrated for the middle elements of the series though there are indications that additional transitions are taking place in the emission spectra. It has also been possible to establish {{the extent to which the}} Miv, v absorption spectra of these elements is due to transitions into the incomplete 4 f shells. Finally, the wavelengths of the spectral components of the M emission and absorption spectra of the middle rare earth elements are quoted and their significance discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{collision}} of laser-produced plasmas has been diagnosed by x-ray spectroscopy and imaging.

Interpenetration of the plasmas was visualized by replacing one of the foils material by magnesium. The main diagnostics viewing the inter-target space were time-resolved monochromatic imaging of the 1 s{sup 2 } 1 s 3 p aluminum line (He{Beta} at {lambda} {minus} 6. 635 {Angstrom}). Doppler broadening measurement with a vertical Johann very high resolution spectrograph in the range 6. 5 [...] 6. 7 {Angstrom}, space-resolved high resolution spectra of the dielectronic satellites of the 1 s- 2 p 1 yman, space-resolved spectra with a flat-crystal spectrograph in the range 5 [...] 7 {Angstrom} and in the range of 43 [...] 48 {Angstrom} obtained with a new OHM <b>crystal</b> <b>spectrograph</b> and a pinhole camera.

40|$|X-ray {{absorption}} spectroscopy is a diagnostic technique that {{is able to}} probe the state of a plasma in detail. Such a measurement usually requires that the plasma under study not radiate in the bandwidth of the probing X-ray flux. This is usually accomplished by limiting {{the temperature of the}} sample plasma. The research presented in this thesis extends the temperature range of {{absorption spectroscopy}} so that more plasmas may be explored with this diagnostic. This is realized in the design of a novel spectrometer based around the geometry of an ellipse. The design is able to discriminate between probing X-rays and those emitted by a sample plasma, relaxing the temperature restriction. The spectrometer's unique design uses a doubly curved mica crystal for X-ray dispersion. The geometry of the spectrometer is verified by ray tracing calculations assuming Bragg reflection from mica in the second order. Control of other reflection orders is attempted by means of filtering and control of the source spectrum. This is found to be insufficient to control fifth order reflections. Potential solutions are presented to combat these fifth order reflections, but all were considered unlikely to succeed in a timely manner. The broad X-ray spectroscopy expertise gained from {{the development and implementation of}} the elliptical design is then used to explore the physics of aluminum's K-edge. This is done using point projection absorption spectroscopy to study a single 25 [MICRO SIGN]m diameter 1199 alloy aluminum wire through which a peak cur- rent of 120 kA is passed. The current heats the aluminum from room temperature to a few electronvolts. The plasma is diagnosed using a spherical quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>spectrograph</b> that records the details of the X-ray spectrum near aluminum's K-edge at 1559 eV. The spectroscopic features of the aluminum plasma are analyzed using a genetic algorithm to match observed spectra to theoretical opacity values. The quality of the fit is discussed by identifying the spectral features that are both present and missing from the opacity calculations. Comparisons are also made to past laser driven studies of the aluminum K-edge. A hypothesis to explain the missing features is proposed...|$|E
