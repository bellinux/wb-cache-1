5|$|Potassium bromide {{and sodium}} bromide {{were used as}} {{anticonvulsants}} and sedatives in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but were gradually superseded by <b>chloral</b> hydrate {{and then by the}} barbiturates. In {{the early years of the}} First World War, bromine compounds such as xylyl bromide were used as poison gas.|$|E
5|$|Waugh's {{health in}} the winter of 1953–54 was indifferent, and he was beset with various {{personal}} anxieties that were stifling his ability to work. He was also consuming alcohol, bromide and <b>chloral</b> in large amounts. In search of a peaceful environment in which he could resume writing, he embarked on a sea voyage to Ceylon, but was driven to the point of madness by imagined voices that assailed him throughout the voyage. These experiences are mirrored in the novel by those of Pinfold, a successful writer in the Waugh mould who, as an antidote to his lassitude and chronic insomnia, is dosing himself with a similar regimen of drugs. This cocktail brings about a series of hallucinatory episodes during a sea voyage taken by Pinfold {{for the sake of his}} health; he hears voices that insult, taunt and threaten him. He leaves the ship, but his unseen tormentors follow him. On his return to England, his wife convinces him that the voices were imaginary, and his doctor diagnoses poisoning from the bromide and <b>chloral</b> mixture. Pinfold, however, also views the episode as a private victory over the forces of evil.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1950s Waugh was troubled {{on a number}} of fronts. He was afflicted with writer's block, and was unable to make {{progress}} with his current novel, the second in his Sword of Honour trilogy. He had financial worries, a legacy of his free-spending post-war habits combined with accumulated tax liabilities and a lack of remunerative productivity. His general health was poor; he suffered from toothache, sciatica and rheumatism, and his memory was faulty. He was also drinking heavily, the effects of which were aggravated by a large intake of <b>chloral</b> and bromide washed down with crème de menthe—a treatment for insomnia that he concealed from his doctors.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{tells her}} {{version of the story}} via a {{flashback}} to the previous day. She arrives at work and Mulder tells her about a murder in Texas, which he believes to be the work of vampires. In her version, Mulder is exuberant, insensitive, and irritating, while she is calm and mindful of her thoughts. The agents travel to the small town of Chaney, Texas where they meet Sheriff Hartwell (Luke Wilson), whom Scully finds highly charming. Mulder and Hartwell leave to investigate further while Scully autopsies the body. She discovers that the victim, whose last meal had been pizza, was incapacitated with <b>chloral</b> hydrate. She returns to the motel room and orders a pizza, but Mulder soon appears and sends her back to autopsy another body. She leaves him just as her food is delivered. When she finds that the second victim had also ingested <b>chloral</b> hydrate in a pizza, she realizes Mulder is in danger and returns to the motel room. She finds him about to be attacked by the pizza delivery boy, Ronnie Strickland (Patrick Renna). She shoots at Ronnie, who runs off into the woods. When she catches up to him, Mulder has gotten there first and hammered a stake into Ronnie's heart.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert Pinfold is an English novelist of repute {{who at the}} age of 50 {{can look}} back on a varied life that has {{included}} a dozen reasonably successful books, wide travel, and honourable service in the Second World War. His reputation secure, he lives quietly, on good but not close terms with his neighbours; his Roman Catholicism sets him slightly apart in the local community. He has a pronounced distaste for most aspects of modern life, and has of late become somewhat lazy, given to drinking more than he should. To counter the effects of his several aches and pains, Pinfold has taken to dosing himself with a powerful sedative of <b>chloral</b> and bromide. He conceals this practice from his doctor.|$|E
5|$|They {{arrived at}} the Andrew Johnson Hotel in Knoxville, Tennessee, where Carr {{requested}} a doctor for Williams, as he was feeling {{the combination of the}} <b>chloral</b> hydrate and alcohol he had drunk on the way from Montgomery to Knoxville. Dr. P.H. Cardwell injected Williams with two shots of vitamin B12 that also contained a quarter-grain of morphine. Carr and Williams checked out of the hotel; the porters had to carry Williams to the car, as he was coughing and hiccuping. At around midnight on Thursday January 1, 1953, when they crossed the Tennessee state line and arrived in Bristol, Virginia, Carr stopped at a small all-night restaurant and asked Williams if he wanted to eat. Williams said he did not, and those are believed to be his last words. Carr later drove on until he stopped for fuel at a gas station in Oak Hill, West Virginia, where he realized that Williams was dead. The filling station's owner called the chief of the local police. In Williams' Cadillac the police found some empty beer cans and unfinished handwritten lyrics.|$|E
25|$|TAA {{produces}} euphoria, sedative, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant effects {{similar to}} ethanol through ingestion or inhalation. It {{is active in}} doses of 2,000–4,000mg, making it 20 times more potent than ethanol. Its hypnotic potency is between <b>chloral</b> hydrate and paraldehyde and between benzodiazepines and ethanol.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} that 8 of the 11 drugs in Smith's system, including the <b>chloral</b> hydrate, were prescribed to Howard K. Stern, not Smith. Additionally, two of the prescriptions were written for Alex Katz and one was written for Smith's friend and psychiatrist, Dr. Khristine Elaine Eroshevich. Dr. Perper acknowledged that all 11 prescriptions were written by Dr. Eroshevich herself.|$|E
25|$|Deuterated {{chloroform}} is an isotopologue of chloroform with {{a single}} deuterium atom. CDCl3 is a common solvent used in NMR spectroscopy. Deuterochloroform is produced by the haloform reaction, the reaction of acetone (or ethanol) with sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite. The haloform process is now obsolete {{for the production of}} ordinary chloroform. Deuterochloroform can be prepared by the reaction of sodium deuteroxide with <b>chloral</b> hydrate.|$|E
25|$|Psychoactive drugs, such as caffeine, amphetamine, mescaline, LSD, marijuana, <b>chloral</b> hydrate, theophylline, IBMX and others, {{can have}} strong effects on certain animals. At small concentrations, some psychoactive drugs reduce the feeding rate of insects and molluscs, and at higher doses some can kill them. Spiders build more disordered webs after {{consuming}} most drugs than before. It {{is believed that}} plants developed caffeine as a chemical defense against insects.|$|E
25|$|Witt's {{research}} was discontinued, {{but it became}} reinvigorated in 1984 after a paper by J.A. Nathanson in the journal Science, which is discussed below. In 1995, a NASA research group repeated Witt's experiments {{on the effect of}} caffeine, benzedrine, marijuana and <b>chloral</b> hydrate on European garden spiders. NASA's results were qualitatively similar to those of Witt, but the novelty was that the pattern of the spider web was quantitatively analyzed with modern statistical tools, and proposed as a sensitive method of drug detection.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, Mrs Rogers' corpse {{is found}} in her bed; she had died in her sleep from an {{overdose}} of <b>chloral</b> hydrate. By lunchtime, General MacArthur is found dead, from a heavy blow to his head. Two more figurines {{are found to be}} broken, and again the deaths parallel the rhyme. Miss Brent, who had refused to speak with the men present, relates the account of the gramophone charge against her to Vera Claythorne, who later tells the others.|$|E
25|$|In the acetalisation reaction, under acidic or basic conditions, {{an alcohol}} {{adds to the}} {{carbonyl}} group and a proton is transferred to form a hemiacetal. Under acidic conditions, the hemiacetal and the alcohol can further react to form an acetal and water. Simple hemiacetals are usually unstable, although cyclic ones such as glucose can be stable. Acetals are stable, but revert to the aldehyde {{in the presence of}} acid. Aldehydes can react with water to form hydrates, R−CH(OH)2. These diols are stable when strong electron withdrawing groups are present, as in <b>chloral</b> hydrate. The mechanism of formation is identical to hemiacetal formation.|$|E
25|$|Very limited {{evidence}} indicates that topiramate or pregabalin {{may be useful in}} the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Limited evidence supports the use of gabapentin or carbamazepine for the treatment of mild or moderate alcohol withdrawal as the sole treatment or as combination therapy with other medications; however, gabapentin {{does not appear to be}} effective for treatment of severe alcohol withdrawal and is therefore not recommended for use in this setting. A 2010 Cochrane review similarly reported that the evidence to support the role of anticonvulsants over benzodiazepines in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal is not supported. Paraldehyde combined with <b>chloral</b> hydrate showed superiority over chlordiazepoxide with regard to life-threatening side effects and carbamazepine may have advantages for certain symptoms.|$|E
25|$|On Vysotsky's death his {{associates}} and relatives put in much {{effort to prevent}} a post mortem being carried out. This despite the fairly unusual circumstances: he died aged 42 under heavy sedation with an improvised cocktail of sedatives and stimulants, including the toxic <b>chloral</b> hydrate, provided by his personal doctor who had been supplying him with narcotics the previous three years. This doctor, being the only one present at his side when death occurred, had {{a few days earlier}} been seen to display elementary negligence in treating the sedated Vysotsky. On the night of his death, Arkadii Vysotsky (his son) who tried to visit his father in his apartment, was rudely refused entry by Yanklovich, even though {{there was a lack of}} people able to care for him. Subsequently the Soviet police commenced a manslaughter investigation which was dropped due to absence of evidence taken at the time of death.|$|E
25|$|At the inquest, {{the medical}} {{examiner}} explains that <b>chloral</b> hydrate {{was given to the}} victim before he was murdered. After the inquest, Edna Brent, one of the secretaries, expresses confusion at something said in evidence. She tries but fails to convey this to Hardcastle. She is soon found dead in a telephone box on Wilbraham Crescent, strangled with her own scarf. The dead man's identity is yet unknown. Mrs Merlina Rival (original name Flossie Gapp) identifies the dead man as her one-time husband, Harry Castleton. Colin leaves Britain on his own case, travelling behind the Iron Curtain to Romania. He returns with the information he needed, but not the person he hoped to find. Following Poirot's advice, Colin talks with the neighbours. He finds a ten-year-old girl, Geraldine Brown, in the apartment block across the street. She has been observing and recording the events at Wilbraham Crescent while confined to her room with a broken leg. She reveals that a new laundry service delivered a heavy basket of laundry {{on the morning of the}} murder. Colin tells Hardcastle.|$|E
500|$|A formal inquest in February 1944 {{returned}} a verdict of [...] "Suicide, motive unknown". In his report, the coroner found that Tatlock had eaten a full meal shortly before her death. She had taken some barbiturates, {{but not a}} fatal dose. Traces of <b>chloral</b> hydrate were found, a drug normally associated with a [...] "Mickey Finn" [...] when combined with alcohol, {{but there was no}} alcohol in her blood, despite damage to her pancreas that indicated she was a heavy drinker. As a psychiatrist working in a hospital, she had access to sedatives such as <b>chloral</b> hydrate. The coroner found that she had died at around 4:30 pm on January 4. The cause of death was recorded as [...] "acute edema of the lungs with pulmonary congestion" [...] — drowning in the bathtub. It seems likely that she knelt over the bathtub, took <b>chloral</b> hydrate, and plunged her head in the water.|$|E
500|$|Vivien's health {{declined}} rapidly after this. According to Vivien's {{friend and}} neighbor Colette, she ate almost nothing and drank heavily, even rinsing {{her mouth with}} perfumed water to hide the smell. Colette's account has led some to call Vivien an anorexic but this diagnosis did not yet exist at the time. Vivien was also addicted to the sedative <b>chloral</b> hydrate. In 1908 she attempted suicide by overdosing on laudanum and died the following year. In a memoir written fifty years later Barney said [...] "She could not be saved. Her life was a long suicide. Everything turned to dust and ashes in her hands." ...|$|E
500|$|Janey's {{relationship}} with Rossetti had continued through a correspondence and occasional visits, although {{she found him}} extremely paranoid and was upset by his addiction to <b>chloral.</b> She last saw him in 1881, and he died in April the following year. Morris described his mixed feelings toward his deceased friend by stating that he had [...] "some of the very greatest qualities of genius, most of them indeed; what a great man {{he would have been}} but for the arrogant misanthropy which marred his work, and killed him before his time". In August 1883, Janey would be introduced to the poet Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, with whom she embarked on a second affair, which Morris might have been aware of.|$|E
500|$|In 1891, after Karim's {{return to}} Britain, he asked Reid {{to send his}} father a large {{quantity}} of medicinal compounds, which included strychnine, <b>chloral</b> hydrate, morphine, and many other poisons. Reid calculated that the amount requested was [...] "amply sufficient to kill 12,000 to 15,000 full grown men or an enormously large number of children" [...] and consequently refused. Instead, Reid persuaded the Queen that the chemicals should be obtained at her expense by the appropriate authorities in India. In June 1892, Waziruddin visited Britain and stayed at both Balmoral and Windsor Castles. He retired in 1893 and in the New Year Honours 1894 he was rewarded, to Victoria's satisfaction, with the title of Khan Bahadur, which Lansdowne noted was [...] "one which under ordinary circumstances the Doctor [...] not have ventured to expect".|$|E
500|$|During {{his last}} {{recording}} session on September 23, 1952, Williams recorded [...] "Kaw-Liga," [...] along with [...] "Your Cheatin' Heart," [...] "Take These Chains from My Heart," [...] and [...] "I Could Never be Ashamed of You." [...] Due to Williams' excesses, Fred Rose stopped working with him. By {{the end of}} 1952, Williams had started to suffer heart problems. He met Horace [...] "Toby" [...] Marshall in Oklahoma City, {{who said that he}} was a doctor. Marshall had been previously convicted for forgery, and had been paroled and released from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in 1951. Among other fake titles {{he said that he was}} a Doctor of Science. He purchased the DSC title for $25 from the Chicago School of Applied Science; in the diploma, he requested that the DSC be spelled out as [...] "Doctor of Science and Psychology". Under the name of Dr. C. W. Lemon he prescribed Williams with amphetamines, Seconal, <b>chloral</b> hydrate, and morphine.|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles County Coroners Office was {{assisted}} in their investigation by psychiatrists from the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Team, who had expert knowledge on suicide [...] It was estimated that Monroe had died between 8:30 and 10:30p.m., and the toxicology report later {{revealed that the}} cause of death was acute barbiturate poisoning. She had 8mg% (milligrams per 100 milliliters of solution) <b>chloral</b> hydrate and 4.5mg% of pentobarbital (Nembutal) in her blood, and a further 13mg% of pentobarbital in her liver. Empty bottles containing these medicines were found next to her bed. The possibility that Monroe had accidentally overdosed was ruled out, because the dosages found in her body were several times over the lethal limit. Her doctors stated that she had been prone to [...] "severe fears and frequent depressions" [...] with [...] "abrupt and unpredictable" [...] mood changes, and had overdosed several times in the past, possibly intentionally. Due to these facts and the lack of any indication of foul play, the coroner classified her death as a [...] "probable suicide".|$|E
500|$|To {{escape his}} persecutors Pinfold disembarks at Alexandria and flies on to Colombo, but the voices pursue him. Pinfold has now {{reconciled}} himself to their presence {{and is able}} to ignore them, or even converse rationally with them. After a brief stay in Colombo he returns to England. On the flight home he is told by [...] "Angel" [...] that the whole episode was a scientific experiment that got out of hand; if Pinfold will keep silent about his experiences, he is told, he will never be bothered by the voices again. Pinfold refuses, declaring Angel to be a menace that must be exposed. Back in England, Mrs Pinfold convinces him that Angel had never left the country and the voices are imaginary. Pinfold hears Margaret faintly say,"I don't exist, but I do love you", before the voices disappear forever. Pinfold's doctor diagnoses poisoning from the bromide and <b>chloral.</b> Pinfold views his courage in the battle against the voices as a significant victory in the battle with his personal demons, and he begins to write an account of his experiences: [...] "The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold".|$|E
500|$|In January 1954 Waugh sailed on the SS Staffordshire, {{bound for}} Ceylon. He hoped on the voyage {{to find the}} peace that would enable him to finish his stalled book. On board, his strange {{behaviour}} became an increasing concern to his fellow-passengers, and the letters which {{he wrote to his}} wife Laura from the ship alarmed her—Waugh appeared to be {{in the grip of a}} persecution mania in which he was beset by threatening, malevolent voices. He left the ship at Alexandria and flew on to Ceylon, but the voices continued to harass him. He wrote to Laura: [...] "Everything I say or think or read is read aloud by the group of psychologists whom I met in the ship... the artful creatures can communicate from many hundreds of miles away". Laura arranged for her friend Jack Donaldson to fly out with her to Colombo to bring Waugh home, but before they could do so Waugh returned to London of his own volition. There he was persuaded by his friend, the Jesuit priest Philip Caraman, to accept treatment from Eric Strauss, the head of psychiatry at St Bartholomew's Hospital. Strauss quickly diagnosed that Waugh's delusions arose from poisoning by his sleeping drugs, and substituted paraldehyde for <b>chloral.</b> The hallucinations disappeared immediately, and Waugh recovered his senses.|$|E
500|$|Eberhardt {{spent her}} money {{recklessly}} in Algiers, and quickly exhausted the funds left {{to her by}} her mother; she would often spend several {{days at a time}} in kief dens. Augustin, ejected from the Foreign Legion due to his health, returned to Geneva alongside Eberhardt in early 1899. They found Trophimowsky in poor health, suffering from throat cancer and traumatised by the loss of Eberhardt's mother and Vladimir, who had committed suicide the previous year. Eberhardt nursed her father, growing closer to him. She also commenced a relationship and became engaged to Rehid Bay, an Armenian diplomat with whom she had been friends and possibly lovers when she was seventeen. Though Trophimowsky approved of the engagement, the relationship soon ended. Historian Lesley Blanch attributes the relationship's downfall to Bey being assigned to Stockholm. Trophimowsky died in May. Blanch attributes the death to a <b>chloral</b> overdose, with which Eberhardt may have intentionally euthanised him. Eberhardt intended to sell the villa, although Trophimowsky's legitimate wife opposed the execution of the will. After several weeks of legal contentions, Eberhardt mortgaged the property and returned to Africa on the first available ship. With both parents dead, she considered herself free of human attachments and able to live as a vagabond. Eberhardt relinquished her mother's name, and called herself Si Mahmoud Saadi. She began wearing male clothing exclusively and developed a masculine personality, speaking and writing as a man. Eberhardt behaved like an Arab man, challenging gender and racial norms. Asked why she dressed as an Arab man, she invariably replied: [...] "It is impossible for me to do otherwise." [...] A few months later, Eberhardt's money ran low, and she returned to Geneva to sell the villa; due to the legal troubles there was little to no money available.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{death was}} {{ultimately}} ruled an accidental drug overdose of the sedative <b>chloral</b> hydrate that became increasingly lethal {{when combined with}} other prescription drugs in her system, specifically four benzodiazepines: Klonopin (Clonazepam), Ativan (Lorazepam), Serax (Oxazepam), and Valium (Diazepam). Furthermore, she had taken Benadryl (Diphenhydramine) and Topamax (Topiramate), an anticonvulsant AMPA/Kainate antagonist, which likely contributed to the sedative effect of <b>chloral</b> hydrate and the benzodiazepines. Although the individual levels {{of any of the}} benzodiazepines in her system would not have been sufficient to cause death, their combination with a high dose of <b>chloral</b> hydrate led to her overdose. The autopsy report indicates that <b>chloral</b> hydrate was the [...] "toxic/lethal" [...] drug, {{but it is difficult to}} know whether <b>chloral</b> hydrate ingestion alone would have killed her, since Dr. Perper indicated (in the March 26 press conference) that she had built up a tolerance to the drug and took more than the average person. He indicated that she took about three tablespoons, whereas the normal dosage is between one and two teaspoons. <b>Chloral</b> hydrate, first synthesized in 1832, was the first depressant developed for the specific purpose of inducing sleep. The infamous [...] "Mickey Finn" [...] or [...] "knockout drops" [...] was a solution of alcohol and <b>chloral</b> hydrate that was popular in Victorian England and in that era's literature. When used properly, and without the introduction of alcohol or other depressants, <b>chloral</b> hydrate is effective in easing sleeplessness due to pain or insomnia. But according to Avis (1990), the effective dose and lethal dose of <b>chloral</b> hydrate are so close that the sedative should be considered dangerous. Today, the use of <b>chloral</b> hydrate has declined as other agents, including barbiturates and benzodiazepines, have largely replaced them. Despite rumors of methadone use due to its involvement in Smith's son's death, Dr. Perper only found methadone in her bile, indicating it could only have been ingested 2–3 days prior to her death and therefore was not a contributing factor. The autopsy report indicates that abscesses on her buttocks (presumably from prior injections of vitamin B12 in the form of cyanocobalamin, as well as human growth hormone), and viral enteritis were contributory causes of death. Tests for influenza A and B were negative.|$|E
2500|$|By 1882 Nietzsche {{was taking}} huge doses of opium {{but was still}} having trouble sleeping. In 1883, while staying in Nice, he was writing out his own {{prescriptions}} for the sedative <b>chloral</b> hydrate, signing them [...] "Dr. Nietzsche".|$|E

A Church staffer noted that McPherson [...] "looked ill like measles or chicken pox on her face." [...] On repeated occasions she refused food and protein shakes that the staff offered. On November 26 and 30 and December 3 to 4, the staff attempted to force feed her, noting that she spat the food out. She was noted to be very weak, not standing up nor on some days moving at all.
