50|$|The saxtuba {{was first}} {{conceived}} by Sax at his workshop in the Rue Saint-Georges in Paris around 1845. On 5 May 1849 Sax {{applied for a}} patent {{for a series of}} brasswind instruments fitted with cylinders. On 16 July 1849 he was granted French Patent 8351. The saxtubas were patented in 1852, in a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>addition</b> to the main patent of 1849. Like Sax's saxhorns and saxotrombas, which were also covered by this patent, the saxtubas were equipped with pavillons tournants - that is to say, their bells could be pointed forward - which was considered ideal for instruments intended to be played by marching or mounted bands in the open air.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} characterizing sets of Boolean functions. Extending results of Ekin et al. and Pippenger, we show that a set of Boolean (or finite) functions can be characterized {{by a set of}} objects called ‘generalized constraints’ iff the set is closed under the operations of permutation <b>of</b> variables and <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> dummy variables. We show a relationship between sets of Boolean functions that are characterizable by a finite set of generalized constraints and sets of Boolean functions that have constant-size <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> non-membership. We then explore whether certain particular sets of Boolean functions have constant-size <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> non-membership; most notably, we show that the well-known set of Boolean threshold functions does not have constant-size <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> non-membership. Finally, we extend results of Pippenger to develop a Galois theory for sets of Boolean functions closed under the operations of permutation <b>of</b> variables and <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> dummy variables...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{introduce}} {{a new approach to}} problem based learning (PBL) used in the context of medicinal chemistry practical class teaching pharmacy students. Design: The described chemistry practical is based on independent studies by small groups of undergraduate students (4 - 5), who design their own practical work taking relevant professional standards into account. Students are carefully guided by feedback and acquire a set of skills important to their future profession as healthcare professionals. This model has been tailored to the application of PBL in a chemistry practical class setting for a large student cohort (150 students). Assessment: The achievement of learning outcomes is based on the submission of relevant documentation including a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> analysis, in <b>addition</b> to peer assessment. Some of the learning outcomes are also assessed in the final written examination {{at the end of the}} academic year. Conclusion: The described design of a novel PBL chemistry laboratory course for pharmacy students has been found to be successful. Self-reflective learning and engagement with feedback were encouraged, and students enjoyed the challenging learning experience. Skills that are highly essential for the students’ future careers as healthcare professionals are promoted...|$|R
