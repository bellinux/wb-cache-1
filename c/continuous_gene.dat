40|$|We apply {{evolutionary}} computations to Hopfield 's {{neural network}} model of associative memory. In the model, some of the appropriate configurations of the synaptic weights give a network a function of associative memory. One of our goals is to obtain the distribution of these configurations in the synaptic weight space. For the purpose, we explore a fitness landscape defined on the weight space. Although {{there have been a}} fair amount of studies regarding the ruggedness of the fitness landscape, all of them are for discrete genes. In this paper, we apply these methods to our <b>continuous</b> <b>genes</b> which represent the synaptic weights of the Hopfield network. I. Introduction Associative memory is a dynamical system which has a number of stable states with a domain of attraction around them [1].

50|$|Typing of inbred strains {{suggested}} that the Mhc might manifest unusually high variability (polymorphism). Inbred strains were, however, not suited for determining polymorphism, because assessing it required measuring gene frequencies in populations. There were all sorts of problems associated with such an effort, most of which could, however, be alleviated by transferring a sample of H2 haplotypes from wild mice onto inbred (C57BL/10 or B10) background and thus producing a set of congenic B10.W lines. These lines proved to be essential for the complete characterization of the new haplotypes; for the identification of natural intra-H2 recombinants; and for their use {{as a tool for}} mapping H2-associated traits. Using a variety of methods, Klein and his colleagues were able to characterize H2 polymorphism in populations of wild mice from different parts of the world. The studies revealed that the polymorphism was indeed staggering, both in the number of alleles and haplotypes (a haplotype being a particular combination of alleles borne by a particular chromosomal segment) that occurred in appreciable frequencies in the populations. Exceptions from the high polymorphism were found only in certain island populations and in populations that have passed recently through a bottleneck phase. The H2 polymorphism, in combination with other markers, could then be used to characterize a population. H2- typing of the global wild mice population revealed it to be fragmented into a large number of small subpopulations (demes), which differed in the presence and frequencies of alleles at the individual loci. Skin grafting and other methods indicated inbreeding within the demes, but sharing of certain alleles between the demes suggested a <b>continuous</b> <b>gene</b> flow between demes.|$|E
50|$|In {{studying}} {{the development of}} the avian immune system, the embryo offers several advantages such as the availability of many embryos at precise stages of development and distinct B and T cell systems. Each population differentiates from a primary lymphoid organ: T cells in the thymus and B cells in the Bursa of Fabricius. Research has found that early feeding of hydrated nutritional supplements in chickens heavily affects the immune system development. This is often measured by weight of the Bursa of Fabricius, improved resistance to disease and earlier appearance of IgA.Unlike other animals, newly hatched chicks are born with an incomplete immune system. Here, the amniotic fluid and yolk of the egg contain the maternal immunity to be passed on to the hatchling. Swallowing of the amniotic fluid during hatching confers immunity to these chicks until their immune system develops fully. In the first six weeks of the bird’s life, <b>continuous</b> <b>gene</b> conversion in the bursa completes the immune system. Upon hatch, birds do not have a library of genetic information for B cells to use for antibody production. Instead, B cells mature in the bursa during the first six weeks and then go on to seed other organs of the immune system. As a result, birds are highly susceptible to pathogens in the first few weeks after hatching. Research found that T cells from mature chickens proliferated extensively and produced high levels of IL-2 and other cytokines. On the other hand, T cells from 24 hour-old chickens failed to proliferate and could not secrete cytokines.Gene conversion within the bursa leads to the development of antibodies that are diverse in their recognition ability. Mammalian V, D and J gene segments allow for many combinations and therefore, yield a vast repertoire of antibodies. However, birds have only a single functional copy of the VL and JL genes for the Ig light chain and a single functional copy of the VH and JH heavy chain genes. This results in a low diversity from gene rearrangements of Ig heavy and light chains. However, clusters of pseudogenes upstream of the heavy and light gene Ig loci take part in somatic gene conversion - a process where pseudogenes replace the VH and VL genes. This diversifies the repertoire of bird antibodies.|$|E

An in-depth analysis of gene conversion {{operating in the}} breakpoint-flanking regions of large NF 1 deletions was performed to investigate whether the rate of discontinuous gene conversion during NAHR with crossover is increased, as has been previously noted in NAHR-mediated rearrangements. All 20 germline type- 1 NF 1 deletions analysed were {{mediated by}} NAHR associated with <b>continuous</b> <b>gene</b> conversion within the breakpoint-flanking regions. <b>Continuous</b> <b>gene</b> conversion was also observed in 31 / 32 type- 2 NF 1 deletions investigated. In contrast to the meiotic type- 1 NF 1 deletions, type- 2 NF 1 deletions are predominantly of post-zygotic origin. Our findings therefore imply that the mitotic {{as well as the}} meiotic NAHR intermediates of large NF 1 deletions are processed by long-patch mismatch repair (MMR), thereby ensuring gene conversion tract continuity instead of the discontinuous gene conversion that is characteristic of short-patch repair. However, the single type- 2 NF 1 deletion not exhibiting <b>continuous</b> <b>gene</b> conversion was processed without MMR, yielding two different deletion-bearing chromosomes which were distinguishable in terms of their breakpoint positions. Our findings indicate that MMR failure during NAHR, followed by post-meiotic/mitotic segregation, has the potential to give rise to somatic mosaicism in human genomic rearrangements by generating breakpoint heterogeneity.

40|$|Abstract—Several {{information}} {{measures such}} as entropy, mutual information, and f-information {{have been shown to}} be successful for selecting a set of relevant and nonredundant genes from a high-dimensional microarray data set. However, for <b>continuous</b> <b>gene</b> expression values, it is very difficult to find the true density functions and to perform the integrations required to compute different information measures. In this regard, the concept of the fuzzy equivalence partition matrix is presented to approximate the true marginal and joint distributions of <b>continuous</b> <b>gene</b> expression values. The fuzzy equivalence partition matrix is based on the theory of fuzzy–rough sets, where each row of the matrix represents a fuzzy equivalence partition that can automatically be derived from the given expression values. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with that of existing approaches using the class separability index and the predictive accuracy of the support vector machine. An important finding, however, is that the proposed approach is shown to be effective for selecting relevant and nonredundant continuous-valued genes from microarray data.

40|$|Background: Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV- 2) is sexually transmitted, {{leading to}} {{blisters}} and ulcers in the genito-anal region. After primary infection {{the virus is}} present in a latent state in neurons in sensory ganglia. Reactivation and production of new viral particles can cause asymptomatic viral shedding or new lesions. Establishment of latency, maintenance and reactivation involve silencing of <b>genes,</b> <b>continuous</b> suppression of <b>gene</b> activities and finally gene activation and synthesis of viral DNA.

Methods: HSV- 2 was collected from 5 patients with true primary and recurrent infections, and the genes encoding glycoproteins B,G,E and I were sequenced. Results: No nucleotide substitution was observed in any patient, indicating genetic stability.
