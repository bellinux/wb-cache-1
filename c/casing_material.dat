40|$|Abstract. Brine {{recirculation}} {{pumps are}} essential components used for circulation of brine in multi-stage flashing chambers desalination plants. Failure of these pumps {{would result in}} shutdown of the desalination plants. The rotating parts of these pumps (shaft and impeller) are usually made out of stainless steels or Duplex stainless steels. The pressure parts (casings) are usually made out of Ni-resist ductile irons (NDI). In recent years {{there have been a}} number of cases in which NDI <b>casing</b> <b>materials</b> failed by stress corrosion cracking (SCC) especially in the Arabian Gulf region. This makes re-evaluation and further studies on the performance of these materials of paramount importance due to process-related economic and reliability considerations.

In this work the effect of corrosion inhibition on the corrosion resistance and SCC of the ASS, UNS S 31603, in hot brine environment, is investigated.

40|$|During {{the period}} of tobacco smoke {{research}} from the early 1950 s to the mid- 1960 s it was repeatedly asserted that a) tobacco and many tobacco components {{were involved in the}} pyrogenesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), several of which were reported to initiate tumors on the skin of laboratory animals and b) tobacco additives (flavorants, <b>casing</b> <b>materials,</b> humectants) were highly likely to be similarly involved in PAH pyrogenesis. Extensive knowledge on PAHs was deemed highly necessary because of their claimed importance in the smoking-health issue. The numerous assertions about the generation of PAHs in cigarette mainstream smoke (MSS) triggered extensive and intensive research both within and outside the Tobacco Industry to define the nature of the PAHs, their per cigarette MSS delivery amounts, their precursors, etc. It was not until 1960 that VAN DUUREN et al. (1) reported three specific aza-arenes in cigarette MSS that were asserted to be involved in smokersâ respiratory tract cancer. As noted in a recent Letter to the Editors (2), the presence of these three aza-arenes in tobacco smoke has never been confirmed. Between 1960 and 1965, other MSS components (phenols as promoters, polonium- 210, N-nitrosamines, ciliastatic compounds) were asserted to be responsible for smoking related diseases. However, no major assertions were made that phenols, polonium- 210, or the N-nitrosamines were derived from flavorants, <b>casing</b> <b>materials,</b> or humectants. Some investigators did report that several ciliastats were derived from added sugars and glycerol. The ciliastat proposal was drastically diminished in importance by the findings in the 1960 s that only a relatively small proportion of the ciliastats reached the smoker's cilia. During that time, pertinent skills and competencies in research on tobacco smoke composition, particularly the PAH fraction, have been developed. Such skills permitted the isolation in crystalline form of 14 PAHs and the quantitation of these and many other PAHs. They were also used to put in perspective the pyrogenesis of PAHs from a) specific tobacco components, b) additives, and c) processed tobaccos (reconstituted tobacco sheet [RTS], expanded tobacco).

40|$|The {{conclusion}} of a previous experiment showed that the compost quantity was the most determining parameter for the production volume of mushrooms, despite the addition of hemi cellulose as carbon source to the compost. The present experiment focuses on the mycelium action {{with regard to the}} carbon availability in the compost. Two factors were studied: (1) The effect of breaking the mycelium at a predetermined depth in the compost layer and before the first mushrooms flush. The hypothesis was that mycelium which is no longer in contact with the mycelium in the <b>casing</b> <b>material</b> would free the carbon nutrition in the lower compost layer. This increased amount of free carbon would be beneficial during the budding. It was expected that breaking the compost layer during the growth of the mycelium would increase the amount of buds.

(2) The effect of distributing the compost in a longer layer which remains partly uncovered by <b>casing</b> <b>material.</b> The compost is distributed into a thin layer with 2 - 3 times the surface area of the reference. The <b>casing</b> <b>material</b> just covers the same surface area of the compost as in the reference.

30|$|The {{frequency}} domain electromagnetic method {{has already been}} widely used for tomographic imaging or electromagnetic well logging. However, different from open hole logging, the metal casing existing in production well logging has a strong shielding effect on the electromagnetic waves, thus bringing some difficulties to {{the application of the}} {{frequency domain}} electromagnetic method in production well logging. According to the relation of the field source geometry to the ring around the mandrel, the general expressions of frequency domain electromagnetic responses in axially symmetrical layered conductive medium are deduced. The propagation effects caused by the low-frequency electromagnetic waves in cased hole are also analyzed. The distribution curves of eddy current density and magnetic flux density along the radial direction in the mandrel indicate that the eddy loss within the mandrel is proportional to the transmission signal frequency and the mandrel conductivity. The secondary field responses of different <b>casing</b> <b>materials</b> show that the transmission frequency has an important effect on the ability of electromagnetic waves penetrating the metal casing. The transmission frequency should be ultra-low in order to enable the electromagnetic signal to penetrate the casing easily. The numerical results of frequency responses for different casing physical parameters show that the casing thickness has {{a significant impact on the}} choice of the transmission frequency. It is also found that the effect of the casing radius on the transmission frequency can be neglected.|$|R
40|$|Published {{scientific}} work indicates that residential large diameter drinking water wells {{are at a}} higher risk of contamination from surface water impacts than drilled wells. The possibility of a higher incidence of contamination of large diameter wells is attributed to site selection and construction problems such as leaking joints in the well casing, ineffective annular sealant placed between the well casing and the formation, a poorly fitted cover with an access lid that promotes contaminant entry and air entry without adequate air filtration, well location down gradient of septic effluent sources, and depth limitations due to improper equipment used to advance the well which results in shallow wells often situated in topographical lows. In some situations, flaws in the well design were actually deliberate measures intended to capture surface water at sites with low groundwater yield. Historically, residential drinking water well performance studies have focussed on existing wells; however, uncertainty in the actual well construction methods and materials, well age and maintenance efforts have been problematic. A field and laboratory study was completed to assess the performance of several design changes that were thought to improve the integrity of large diameter drinking water wells, and to determine whether one design is more prone to atmospheric and/or surface water contamination than the other. Four large diameter residential wells were installed at a study site in Lindsay, Ontario. Three of these wells are constructed with enhanced construction methods (two using a cement tile casing and one using a galvanized steel casing) and annular sealants, while the fourth was constructed using conventional methods for cement cased wells. The enhanced test wells utilized a sealant between the casing sections, various annular sealants between the formation and the well casing, sanitary waterline connections, and ventilation with air filtration. The well constructed using outdated methods did not have any of these advanced features. An automated water extraction system removed about 875 L/day from each well to mimic residential usage. Routine monitoring, and laboratory and field testing were used to collect pertinent data required for this performance assessment. Routine monitoring involved the visual inspection of the wells, collection of well water elevation, collection of soil temperature profile data, collection and analysis of water samples, and collection of cumulative water volumes purged from the test wells. A biofilm cleaning study and analysis of cement-bentonite grout was conducted in the laboratory while smoke and aqueous tracer tests were conducted in the field. The biofilm cleaning study entailed growing a biofilm on different large diameter well <b>casing</b> <b>materials</b> and applying cleaning methods thought to be practical for cleaning the interior walls of large diameter wells. Different mixtures of cement-bentonite grout were subjected to volume measurements, vertical load bearing capacity analysis, and hydraulic conductivity analysis to determine their suitability as a potential annular sealant. The tracer tests were developed to determine whether pathways for either airborne contaminants or surface water to enter the test wells exist. The test wells were filled with smoke and monitored for potential atmospheric pathways. A tracer solution was infiltrated around the test wells and the interior of the tests wells were monitored for potential pathways for surface water to enter. Bacteriological indicators were detected in all test wells. The smoke tracer tests demonstrated that pathways for airborne contaminants to enter the test wells exist with more pathways observed in the winter than the summer. The aqueous tracer tests highlighted several areas where surface water could enter the test wells if ponding occurred around the well casing. As expected the enhanced test wells performed much better than the conventional test well for both of these tracer tests. The results of the biofilm cleaning study indicated that galvanized steel or fibreglass <b>casing</b> <b>materials</b> were the only materials able to be cleaned effectively. The best method in this study to remove biofilm from <b>casing</b> <b>materials</b> was pressure washing. The results from the cement-bentonite grout investigation indicated that cement-bentonite grout with 5 % bentonite would make the most suitable annular sealant as its volume changed the least during curing, it was strong enough to support the load from maintenance efforts, and was the most impervious. The results {{of this study indicate that}} large diameter wells constructed with a proper annular sealant, sealant between casing sections and a sanitary waterline connection are less prone to contamination. Monitoring of the test wells should continue as they mature to determine whether this plays a significant role in their ability to prevent contamination of large diameter wells. Smoke tracer tests should be conducted again during the winter to determine if temperature was the cause of increased atmospheric pathways. A field-scale method to remove biofilm from the interior casing wall of large diameter wells should be developed and tested. A field-scale investigation of cement-bentonite grout for use as an annular sealant should be completed. Fibreglass casings can be fabricated as a continuous piece with no seams or joints and hence another well should be constructed and studied using corrugated fibreglass (NSF ANSI 61) casing...|$|R

In each weapon, HE is enclosed by (<b>casing)</b> <b>materials</b> that function as protection {{in the event of a}} neighbor detonation but become a source of fragments if the HE is initiated.

Interaction of a fragment with an acceptor weapon can produce a reaction in the acceptor HE and result in a second detonation. In this paper we describe a comprehensive methodology to estimate the probability of various consequences for fragment-induced propagating detonations in arrays of weapons containing HE. Analysis of this problem requires an approach that can both define the circumstances under which rare events can occur and calculate the probability of such occurrences. Our approach is based on combining process tree methodology with Monte Carlo transport simulation. Our Monte Carlo technique very effectively captures important features of these differences.

Two and three-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations have been done to model these experiments.

The calculations indicate that the HE was not strongly confined in this experiment, primarily due to the lateral expansion of polycarbonate blocks {{on the sides of the}} target during the impact. HE was not ejected from the hole in the casing made by the projectile up to 30 {micro}s after the impact.

All of the geothermal wells drilled into extremely high temperatures push their components including casing strings, casing connections, wellhead assembly, cement sheaths, drilling fluid to its technical limits. Based on the classification of casing failures made by Teodoriu (2015), excluding casing failure from corrosion, extensive wear, and overloading, most wells investigating high-temperature geothermal resources will fall {{into the category of}} the so-called temperature variation induced fatigue. This kind of failure is caused by large temperature variations and is aggravated by the lack of casing mobility within the cement sheaths.

Similarly to the <b>casing</b> <b>material</b> and connections, fatigue due to extensive thermally driven loads will lead to cement sheaths damage and loss of the cement bond at casingâcement or cementârock interfaces with potential influx of hostile reservoir fluids.|$|E
40|$|Three {{strains of}} Agaricus bisporus, i. e, Albidus, Avellanum and Horst 0 - 3 were {{cultivated}} in controlled environments. The effect of some nutrient supplementation in the <b>casing</b> <b>material</b> on crop productivity, was studied. The number and yield of mushrooms increased when leucine, sodium chloride and yeast extract {{were added to}} the casing at 10 ppm at three day intervals for seven weeks. The size of the fruiting bodies were, also, found to be larger than that of check treatment. The best yield was obtained when the trays were treated with yeast extract. The addition of spawn-run compost (compost fully colonized by fungal mycelium) to <b>casing</b> <b>material</b> resulted in early initiation and development of sporophores, early completion of cropping, and a yield of mushrooms higher by 18 - 25 % depending on the strain. The number of days required for appearance of fruiting bodies primordia and for the harvest was, also reduced by 4 - 5 days. Horst 0 - 3 was found to be the best strain as far as the period of cropping and total yeild were concerned. These results offer good prospects for increasing the production of mushrooms in commercial farms...|$|E
30|$|Comparing the EDS options {{available}} for RIG- 1, considering the EDS proposed in Scenario B, the first option fits very well (EDS 2) {{and should be}} selected for this step, while the <b>material</b> (<b>casing</b> 13 3 / 8 â³, 72 Â lb/ft, P- 110) remains {{in front of the}} BOP. This process of EDS selection is repeated for all steps of the operation in which the BOP is connected to the well.|$|R
50|$|The organ {{includes}} pallets (valves) in the windchest and {{a mechanical}} tracker action built by RÃ¶ver. The stop action is pneumatically operated. Since the organ {{had never been}} converted to Baroque style the <b>casing,</b> the pipe <b>material</b> and the technical premises are still completely original. The organ thus preserved its original riches of tone. In June and July 2007 Katrin Haspelmath cleaned and overhauled the organ and her company takes continuously care of the instrument.|$|R
40|$|The {{suitability}} of cow slurry {{as a substrate}} for vermicomposting by Eisenia fetida was investigated. Particular attention {{was given to the}} effects of the earthworm on the decomposition and stabilisation of the slurry; and to the interactions between E. fetida and the microflora of the substrate. Assessment of the chemical and microbiological changes in cow slurry stored under forced aeration, and subsequently in shallow trays, showed that neither method was suitable for the treatment of slurry. A comparison of two methods of vermicomposting showed that top-feeding of slurry was more efficient in promoting earthworm growth and cocoon production than the mixing of slurry with solid materials. Management practices were found to have an important influence on the efficiency of the process. An investigation o:f the effect of E. fetida. on the decomposition of slurry indicated that the presence of this earthworm enhanced the stabilisation of the substrate and increased the plant-available nitrogen content. Specific nutritional interactions were observed between E. fetida and micro-organisms in sand/cellulose microcosms. The earthworms were found to be feeding directly upon the cells of certain micro-organisms. Other species were found to be toxic to E. fetida [...] A technique was developed :for the production of axenic E. fetida., and the use of such earthworms in :feeding experiments confirmed the importance of some micro-organisms in earthworm nutrition. The seeding of vermiculture beds with one such micro-organism stimulated earthworm growth and consumption of the substrate. Vermicomposted mixtures of cow slurry and spent mushroom compost were shown to have potential application as <b>casing</b> <b>materials</b> in mushroom cultivation. The findings of this study indicate the {{suitability of}} vermicomposting as a method for the stabilisation of intensively-produced cow slurry, and give some indication of the importance of micro-organisms in the nutrition of E. fetida...|$|R
