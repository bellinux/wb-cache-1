25|$|The Muisca did not {{construct}} {{large stone}} structures. They {{did not use}} the abundant rock to leave monumental ruins as has happened with other American cultures. Their houses were built with materials such as clay, canes, and wood. The houses had a <b>conical</b> <b>form,</b> most of them to the point that Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, founder of Bogotá, gave the area the name Valle de los Alcázares ("Valley of the Palaces"). The houses had small doors and windows, and the dwellings of the higher rank citizens were different. The Muisca used little furniture as they would typically sit on the floor.|$|E

East Cleveland marks the northern end of the chain of cliffs that runs along the North Yorkshire Heritage Coast.

One of the best known symbols of Cleveland is the distinctive hill of Roseberry Topping, which overlooks Newton under Roseberry on the Great Ayton to Guisborough road. Its original roughly <b>conical</b> <b>form</b> was undercut by extensive mining, giving it a jagged appearance that many have thought reminiscent of the Matterhorn mountain.|$|E

A seamount is technically defined as an isolated rise in elevation of [...] or more from the surrounding seafloor, and with a limited summit area, of <b>conical</b> <b>form.</b> If small knolls, ridges and hills less than 1,000m in height are included there are over 100,000 seamounts in the world ocean.|$|E
500|$|A {{seamount}} is {{a mountain}} {{rising from the}} ocean seafloor that does not reach to the water's surface (sea level), and thus is not an island, islet or cliff-rock. Seamounts are typically formed from extinct volcanoes that rise abruptly and are usually found rising from the seafloor to [...] in height. They are defined by oceanographers as independent features that rise to at least [...] above the seafloor, characteristically of <b>conical</b> <b>form.</b> The peaks are often found hundreds to thousands of meters below the surface, and are therefore considered to be within the deep sea. During their evolution over geologic time, the largest seamounts may reach the sea surface where wave action erodes the summit to form a flat surface. [...] After they have subsided and sunk below the sea surface such flat-top seamounts are called [...] "guyots" [...] or [...] "tablemounts" ...|$|E

He first described the growth cone based on fixed cells as [...] "a concentration of protoplasm of <b>conical</b> <b>form,</b> endowed with amoeboid movements" [...] (Cajal, 1890). Neuronal growth cones are situated on the very tips of nerve cells on structures called axons and dendrites.

40|$|Purpose. Studies of {{the effect}} of {{aerodynamic}} pressure on the maximum permissible speeds of a high-speed train on the existing railway infrastructure. Methodology. The study of the magnitude and direction of the aerodynamic pressure, its effect on the maximum speeds of a high-speed train was carried out on a train model composed of axisymmetric bodies with <b>conical</b> <b>forms</b> of head and tail parts. Findings. Determined the values of the aerodynamic pressure at different distances from the train are, when the high-speed train moves at a speed of 200 km/h or more. The maximum speeds of a high-speed train are determined taking into account the state of the infrastructure of the existing railway, ensuring the safe operation of a high-speed railway. Originality. Theoretical studies of aerodynamic pressure from secondary air currents formed during the movement of high-speed trains are performed on a model of a train composed of identical axisymmetric bodies with <b>conical</b> <b>forms</b> of head and tail moving in a compressible medium. The results of the research allow the regularity of the change in aerodynamic pressure during the movement of a high-speed train. Practical value. The obtained results allow to establish: 1) the maximum permissible speeds of a high-speed train taking into account the technical condition of permanent devices and structures of the existing railway infrastructure; 2) technical parameters of individual objects and structural elements of the infrastructure of high-speed iron subjected to the effect of aerodynamic pressure for a given maximum speed of high-speed trains...|$|R

The influence of Post-Modernism can be read in the juxtaposition of these formal geometric compositions with Betteridge’s characteristic wit, and in the mixing of precious metal with non-precious materials. For example, Mad Hatter’s Tea Party, 1988, is a teapot that combines a formal, globular body with base and handle elements of acrylic, silver and brass sheet. The exposed connections between the individual components of the teapot display the post-modernist and constructivist influences with which Betteridge experimented during this period.|$|R
