25|$|The {{buttressing}} of {{the walls}} would be tested in AD 256 when Shapur I besieged the city. True to the fears of the defenders, Shapur set his engineers to undermine what archaeologists called Tower 19, two towers north of the Palmyrene Gate. When the Romans {{became aware of the}} threat, they dug a <b>countermine</b> with the aim of meeting the Persian effort and attack them before they could finish their work. The Persians had already dug complex galleries along the wall by the time the Roman <b>countermine</b> reached them. They managed to fight off the Roman attack, and when the city defenders noticed the flight of soldiers from the <b>countermine,</b> it was quickly sealed. The wounded and stragglers were trapped inside, where they died. (It was the coins found with these Roman soldiers that dated the siege to AD 256.) The <b>countermine</b> was successful, for the Persians abandoned their operations at Tower 19.|$|E
25|$|In January 2009, {{researchers}} {{claimed they}} had found evidence that the Persian Empire used poisonous gases at Dura against the Roman defenders during the siege. Excavations at Dura have discovered the remains of 19 Roman and 1 Persian soldiers {{at the base of}} the city walls. An archaeologist at the University of Leicester suggested that bitumen and sulphur crystals were ignited to create poisonous gas, which was then funnelled through the tunnel with the use of underground chimneys and bellows. The Roman soldiers had been constructing a <b>countermine,</b> and Sassanian forces are believed to have released the gas when their mine was breached by the Roman <b>countermine.</b> The lone Persian soldier discovered among the bodies is believed to be the individual responsible for releasing the gas before the fumes overcame him as well.|$|E

25|$|On September 11, Antoine Dagneaux de Quindre, {{in command}} of the Detroit militia, {{convinced}} the Indians to begin digging a tunnel from the bank of the river towards the fort. Known as mining, the goal was to place barrels of gunpowder in the tunnel under a section of the fort's walls. When these barrels were exploded, the wall would collapse, leaving a place for the attackers to rush in. When the defenders inside the fort heard the digging, they began to dig a <b>countermine,</b> hoping to collapse the attackers' tunnel prematurely. The diggers on both sides began to yell taunts at each other. Heavy rains caused the Indians' tunnel to collapse before it reached the fort.|$|E

2500|$|The fort's {{construction}} was improved under the German Empire, which renamed it Fort Goeben after a Prussian general who had distinguished {{himself at the}} Battle of Spicheren on 6 August 1870. Immediate German construction focused on dispersing gun batteries to flanking positions and reinforcing protection for personnel and ammunition against shellfire. In 1885, new explosives led to a massive increase in the explosive power of artillery projectiles, the so-called crise de l'obus-torpille ("torpedo-shell crisis). This development made unprotected artillery and masonry construction entirely obsolete, as the new shells could easily destroy masonry structures. [...] In response, concrete and earth sheltering was employed in new forts, and older forts were reinforced under the new principles. In 1885 a program of reinforcement covered some critical areas of Queuleu with concrete and provided better infantry shelters. As an early fort, Queuleu has relatively few underground passages compared to the Moselstellung forts of the 1890s, but does feature <b>countermine</b> passages extending {{from the front of}} the fort.|$|E

5000|$|Famously, Chainmail also {{contains}} a set of castle siege rules which deals with mines and <b>countermines.</b> It suggests that underground wargames [...] "are only possible to conduct on paper".

These rules created a precedent for a referee managing secret information about underground spaces on graph paper that would be followed by Dungeons & Dragons.|$|R
