50|$|The Viper is {{constructed}} mostly of metal, with aluminium skinning, using CNC machining. Composite materials {{are used for}} {{the tips of the}} flying surfaces, the fuselage upper decking, engine cowling and wheel fairings. The wings have <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> and curved, slightly upswept tips; they are built around one main and one auxiliary spar. The short span ailerons move on piano-type hinges, with slotted flaps {{on the rest of the}} trailing edges. The low-mounted horizontal tail is also of <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> apart from a cut-out for rudder movement; the starboard elevator carries a flight adjustable trim tab. Fin and rudder are straight-edged, but swept.|$|R
50|$|The Milano had a {{rectangular}} section, plywood skinned fuselage, with an open, unscreened cockpit below the wing leading edge. A wooden landing skid, with deep rubber springing, ran aft from near the {{nose to the}} end of the N-frame, assisted by a small tail bumper. The empennage was similar to those of the BS.7 and BS.8, with a strut braced triangular tailplane on a short, broad fin, the latter carrying a <b>constant</b> <b>chord,</b> unbalanced rudder about three times the height of the fin. The elevators were also unbalanced and of <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> apart from a cut-out for rudder movement.|$|R

50|$|The Monnett Monerai is a {{sailplane}} {{that was}} developed in the United States in the late 1970s for homebuilding. It is a conventional pod-and-boom design with a V-tail and a mid-mounted cantilever wing of <b>constant</b> <b>chord.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} uses a {{welded steel}} tube fuselage with doped aircraft fabric covering. The wings use wooden spars and ribs. The biplane uses {{conventional landing gear}} and has two tandem open cockpits. The wings are <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> and swept 10 degrees.|$|R
50|$|It {{was a small}} mid-winged aircraft, {{with wings}} and other flying {{surfaces}} of <b>constant</b> <b>chord.</b> It had no fixed tail surfaces. The triangular cross-section fuselage was unusually deep, such that the undercarriage cross-axle {{was attached to the}} keel or bottom longeron.|$|R
50|$|The RemSchetMash Robust is {{the only}} {{aircraft}} built to date by this general manufacturing company. It has a high wing of <b>constant</b> <b>chord,</b> without flaps. The wings are braced by single struts to the lower fuselage. This is a carbon fibre monocoque with a starboard side door {{for access to the}} single-seat cockpit. A conventional tricycle undercarriage is mounted on the fuselage with spring steel cantilever legs bearing the mainwheels. The rear underside of the fuselage tapers upwards to the tail, where a <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> tailplane carries a single piece elevator between two endplate fins. The fins and rudders are parallel edged but with rounded tips, the rudders noticeably less deep than the fins.|$|R
50|$|The Deauvilles were of {{all-metal}} construction with low/mid set {{wings of}} <b>constant</b> <b>chord,</b> straight tapered tail surfaces and a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. The canopy was entirely transparent and slid back {{to permit the}} access of pilot and passengers. Dual controls were provided.|$|R
50|$|The H-22B-3 has {{a simple}} wooden two spar wing of <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> and {{dihedral}} 1° 20', covered with fabric. The wing is high mounted, braced {{to the lower}} fuselage {{by a pair of}} V-form struts on both sides. Upper surface spoilers are fitted.|$|R
5000|$|... (TS510) Also {{known as}} the [...] "Medium-U" [...] version, had the same swept wing {{planform}} as the GAL.56/01 mounted outboard of a <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> centre section, total wingspan 51 ft (15.5 m). First flight was on 27 February 1946, at RAF Aldermaston.|$|R
50|$|The hull became slender {{towards the}} rear and curved upwards to support a biplane, <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> {{horizontal}} tail with balanced elevators on its upper and lower planes. Between the planes were three fins, each carrying a rudder; their trapezoidal shape allowed for elevator movement.|$|R
2500|$|The Ibis is {{a single}} engine pusher canard, with swept mainplanes {{carrying}} swept endplate fins and rudders. These rear wings have <b>constant</b> <b>chord,</b> so all the plywood ribs are identical for ease of construction, and are built around a constant cross section box spar. [...] They are then filled with styrodur foam before the plywood skin is applied. [...] There is no dihedral or washout. Full span flaperons provide roll control. [...] The vertical surfaces are made {{in a similar way}} and extend both above and below the wing, incorporating rudders for yaw control. [...] The canard fore wing is again similarly made but is unswept; it has <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> with rounded tips and has no dihedral or washout. [...] It carries slotted elevators for pitch control.|$|R

50|$|The RFD Company {{constructed}} the Albatross to C.H. Latimer-Needham's design, the first British-designed and built sailplane. It was a conventional wooden single-seat aircraft, its cantilever high wing having a <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> centre section and outboard straight-tapered panels from about mid-span. Ailerons were fitted from the wing tips {{over most of}} the outboard sections but here were no flaps or air brakes. The wing was mounted with slight dihedral on top of the fuselage, which was rectangular in cross section and tapered only a little towards the tail. There were no fixed rear surfaces, both elevators and rudder being all moving. The elevator, mounted on top of the fuselage, had <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> apart from a cut-out for rudder movement; the latter was tall, with a vertical leading edge and curved trailing edge.|$|R
50|$|The Jacobs plans {{show the}} Hols der Teufel had a simple, <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> wing {{much like that}} of the Zögling though of greater span, built around two spars and fabric covered except at the leading edge which was plywood skinned. Its broad, <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> ailerons were longer than those of the Zögling and its round cornered, tapered tips were less angular. As before, the wing was {{supported}} by the forward members of its girder fuselage; a vertical strut near the leading edge and an inverted V-strut behind. As the wing was strut rather than wire braced there was no longer a need to extend these struts above the wing into a pylon. The two faired, parallel lift struts on each side ran from the lower forward fuselage to the wing at about mid-span.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Although the <b>chord</b> <b>height</b> error {{might be}} ensured, the {{adaptive}} algorithm of the NURBS curve circular interpolation feed rate is still {{likely to result}} in the speed fluctuation which is not in accordance with given acceleration or deceleration rules. On the foundation of the analytic principle of the NURBS curve circular interpolation, a kind of interpolating algorithm based on the NURBS curve continuous small segments of S-shaped acceleration and deceleration is presented. And considering the <b>chord</b> <b>height</b> error, the variable step and feed rate can be effectively combined to make a better estimation. The simulation results on real examples show that the method not only simplifies the complicated calculation of curve interpolation process, simultaneously improves the speed of Motion Smoothing Implementation for NURBS curve interpolation, but also ensures the interpolation precision. The algorithm can be commonly applied in real manufacturing for high-speed and high-precision curve process...|$|R
50|$|The V 39 was a two bay biplane with <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> wings {{mounted with}} slight stagger {{and a wide}} gap. The fabric covered wings had box spars and three-ply ribs. There were ailerons on both upper and lower wing, {{externally}} rod-connected. The upper wing was centrally supported with cabane struts.|$|R
50|$|The HL.I was a {{cantilever}} low-wing monoplane {{with wings}} of <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> and rounded tips. Its tail was conventional, with a braced straight-tapered horizontal tail mounted {{on top of}} the fuselage and a largely rounded vertical tail with a rudder which extended below the tailplane, moving within an elevator cut-out.|$|R
