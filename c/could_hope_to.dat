5|$|The 19th-century German {{classical}} scholar Erwin Rohde viewed Orion as {{an example}} of the Greeks erasing the line between the gods and mankind. That is, if Orion was in the heavens, other mortals <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> be also.|$|E
5|$|At any rate, Philip {{chose to}} build lembi. These were the small fast galleys {{used by the}} Illyrians. They had a single bank of oars {{and were able to}} carry 50 {{soldiers}} in addition to the rowers. With these, Philip <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> avoid or evade the Roman fleet, preoccupied as he hoped it would be with Hannibal, and based, as it was, at Lilybaeum in western Sicily.|$|E

That was all they <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> see realized in their lifetime.|$|E

5|$|During the decade, Themistocles {{continued}} to advocate {{the expansion of}} Athenian naval power. The Athenians were certainly aware throughout this period that the Persian interest in Greece had not ended; Darius's son and successor, Xerxes I, had continued the preparations for the invasion of Greece. Themistocles seems to have realised that for the Greeks to survive the coming onslaught required a Greek navy that <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> {{face up to the}} Persian navy, and he therefore attempted to persuade the Athenians to build such a fleet. Aristides, as champion of the zeugites (the upper, 'hoplite-class') vigorously opposed such a policy.|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} {{source of}} an emperor's {{power and authority}} was the military. The legionaries were paid by the Imperial treasury, and swore an annual military oath of loyalty to the emperor (sacramentum). The death of an emperor led to a crucial period of uncertainty and crisis. Most emperors indicated their choice of successor, usually a close family member or adopted heir. The new emperor had to seek a swift acknowledgement of his status and authority to stabilize the political landscape. No emperor <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> survive, much less to reign, without the allegiance and loyalty of the Praetorian Guard and of the legions. To secure their loyalty, several emperors paid the donativum, a monetary reward. In theory, the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or Praetorians.|$|E
5|$|Neither the mutiny nor {{the popular}} {{uprising}} came entirely {{as a surprise}} to the French authorities. The colonial government's first large scale crackdown on the VNQDD in 1929 had substantially damaged the party, which had modelled itself on the Chinese Kuomintang of Chiang Kai-shek. The crackdown also had the effect of increasing the violent tendencies within what remained of the VNQDĐ. Its remaining leadership was now willing to intensify preparations for a violent overthrow of colonial rule to create an independent Vietnamese republic. Most of the party's leadership ranks, but not its lower-ranking members and affiliates, seem to have concluded that they were too weak and too closely spied on by the Sûreté to have a meaningful chance of success. At the most optimistic, they <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> trigger a spontaneous uprising; at the worst, the subsequent French reprisals would transform them into anti-colonial martyrs. Finally, there was disagreement or a communication problem over the timing of the insurrection: after Hoc had ordered the postponement of the mutiny, Nhu still proceeded.|$|E

5|$|Rudd was {{offering}} generous terms that few competitors <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> {{even come close}} to. If Lobengula agreed, Rudd's backers would furnish the king with 1,000 Martini–Henry breech-loading rifles, 100,000 rounds of matching ammunition, a steamboat on the Zambezi (or, if Lobengula preferred, a lump sum of £500), and £100 a month in perpetuity. More impressive to the king than the financial aspects of this offer were the weapons: he {{had at the time}} between 600 and 800 rifles and carbines, but almost no ammunition for them. The proposed arrangement would lavishly stock his arsenal with both firearms and bullets, which might prove decisive in the event of conflict with the South African Republic. The weapons might also help him keep control of the more rambunctious factions amid his own impis. Lobengula had Helm go over the document with him several times, in great detail, to ensure that he properly understood what was written. None of Rudd's alleged oral conditions were in the concession document, making them legally unenforceable (presuming they indeed existed), but the king apparently regarded them as part of the proposed agreement nonetheless.|$|E

25|$|Likewise, the {{inhabitants}} of conquered cities were frequently massacred during the Crusades against the Muslims in the 11th and 12th centuries. Noblemen <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> be ransomed; their families would have to send to their captors large sums of wealth commensurate with the social status of the captive.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} the Greek cities by Philip and Alexander also taught the Greeks that their city-states could never again be powers in their own right, and that the hegemony of Macedon and its {{successor}} states could not be challenged unless the city states united, or at least federated. The Greeks valued their local independence too much to consider actual unification, but they made several attempts to form federations through which they <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> reassert their independence.|$|E
25|$|First of all, the King sent Danish noblemen to Norway {{in order}} to {{administer}} the country and to fill civilian and military offices. Norwegian noblemen were deliberately under-represented when new high officials were appointed. Whilst this {{was a part of}} the King’s tactics, also the lack of Norwegian noblemen with qualified educationNorway did not have a universitywas a reason for that the King had to send foreigners. The educational sector was considerably better developed in Sleswick and Holsatia, plus in Germany, so only nobles who sent their children to foreign universities <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> keep or obtain high offices.|$|E

25|$|From 1326 to 1334 Orsini was Pope John XXII's {{legate a latere}} in Italy, with {{particular}} faculties over the provinces of Romagna, Tuscany, Sardinia, and Marca Umbria, which were troubled by civil wars, and was given the task of pacifying them. John chose Orsini as his legate, seeing him as an Italian prince who could find {{his way through the}} maze of Italian politics as no Gaul <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> do. However, the people of Italy saw Orsini not as an Italian but as a Roman, and very specifically as a prince of the Orsini family.|$|E
25|$|Barbary slaves <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> {{be freed}} through payment of a ransom. Despite {{the efforts of}} {{middlemen}} and charities {{to raise money to}} provide ransoms, they were still very difficult to come by. As European communities increased their charity funding for ransoming slaves, North African states increased the amount of ransom required. Lack of money to pay a ransom was not the only problem. Persons taken captive needed to notify their families of their status and tell them the ransom price. Mail charges were often beyond the reach of ordinary captive slaves, and it could take several months for the mail to be delivered.|$|E
25|$|This {{led to a}} {{worrying}} scenario {{coming to}} dominate US strategic thinking through the 1970s and 80s. If the Soviets launched a sneak attack on the US using {{only a portion of}} their missile fleet, about , aimed solely at US silos and airbases, they <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> destroy as much as 90% of the US's fleet. This attack would not kill many civilians, and leave the US with only a few ICBMs and bombers, along with the US Navy's Submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) fleet. However, the SLBMs of that era were not accurate enough to attack missile silos, the US {{would not be able to}} respond with a counterforce attack against the substantial numbers of remaining Soviet ICBMs. The only option left would be a general attack on Soviet cities, which would cause the Soviets to respond in kind with their remaining fleet. In this situation, the Soviets would be in an extremely advantageous position for a negotiated peace.|$|E

25|$|Since he {{had become}} king the {{relationship}} between James and his nephew and son-in-law had gradually deteriorated. At first William welcomed {{the promise of a}} less pro-French policy. In 1685 he sent the Scottish and English mercenary regiments of his army to England to assist in putting down the Monmouth Rebellion. Soon however, James's policy of religious tolerance caused tensions to rise between them. William assumed it was but the first step towards a total re-Catholicisation of England and was unable to explain how James <b>could</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> achieve this goal unless he had concluded a secret alliance with France. James's refusal to enter any anti-French coalition and his efforts to reorganise the Royal Navy increased William's suspicions. In the previous years the French navy had grown significantly in strength and the Dutch Republic would {{no longer be able to}} resist a combined Anglo-French attack. William feared that even English neutrality would not suffice and that control over the Royal Navy was a prerequisite for a successful naval campaign against France.|$|E

500|$|In {{many respects}} (to Kennan's consternation) the {{priorities}} of the administration emphasized creating alliances against the Soviets more than negotiating differences with them.
