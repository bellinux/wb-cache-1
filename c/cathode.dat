40|$|Abstract. Structured <b>cathodes</b> − <b>cathodes</b> with a {{segmented}} emission surface − {{are finding}} {{an increasing number}} of applications and can be combined with a variety of emission mechanisms, including photoemission and field emission.

In this report we present recent progress towards the development of finite-difference time-domain particle-in-cell simulations using the emission process in structured <b>cathodes</b> based on the WARP framework.

40|$|Durability {{is central}} to the commercialization of polymer {{electrolyte}} fuel cells (PEFCs). The incorporation of TiO 2 with platinum (Pt) ameliorates both the stability and catalytic activity of <b>cathodes</b> in relation to pristine Pt <b>cathodes</b> currently being used in PEFCs. PEFC <b>cathodes</b> comprising carbon-supported Pt-TiO 2 (Pt-TiO 2 /C) exhibit higher durability in relation to Pt/C <b>cathodes</b> as evidenced by cell polarization, impedance, and cyclic voltammetry data. The degradation in performance of the Pt-TiO 2 /C <b>cathodes</b> is 10 % after 5000 test cycles as against 28 % for Pt/C <b>cathodes.</b> These data are in conformity with the electrochemical surface area and impedance values. Pt-TiO 2 /C <b>cathodes</b> can withstand even 10, 000 test cycles with nominal effect on their performance. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope, and cross-sectional field-emission-scanning electron microscope studies on the catalytic electrodes reflect that incorporating TiO 2 with Pt helps in mitigating the aggregation of Pt particles and protects the Nafion membrane against peroxide radicals formed during the cathodic reduction of oxygen.

40|$|International audienceReversible anionic redox has rejuvenated {{the search}} for {{high-capacity}} lithium-ion battery <b>cathodes.</b> Real-world success necessitates the holistic mastering of this electrochemistry's kinetics, thermodynamics, and stability. Here we prove oxygen redox reactivity in the archetypical lithium-and manganese-rich layered <b>cathodes</b> through bulk-sensitive synchrotron based spectroscopies, and elucidate their complete anionic/cationic charge-compensation mechanism. Furthermore, via various electroanalytical methods, we answer how the anionic/cationic interplay governs application-wise important issues—namely sluggish kinetics, large hysteresis, and voltage fade—that afflict these promising <b>cathodes</b> despite widespread industrial and academic efforts. We find that cationic redox is kinetically fast and without hysteresis unlike sluggish anions, which furthermore show different oxidation vs. reduction potentials. Additionally, more time spent with fully oxidized oxygen promotes voltage fade. These fundamental insights about anionic redox are indispensable for improving lithium-rich <b>cathodes.</b> Moreover, our methodology provides guidelines for assessing the merits of existing and future anionic redox-based high-energy <b>cathodes,</b> which are being discovered rapidly...|$|R
