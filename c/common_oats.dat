40|$|Results All mink {{and blue}} foxes {{maintained}} good health throughout both experiments. Mink In the digestibility trial mean final weights in mink (Figure 1) were equal in all diet groups (1846. 7 - 1908. 3 g), except the group dehulled oats 15 % {{where it was}} lower. In the production trial {{no statistically significant differences}} between treatments were found in weight gain (Figure 3). In the latter part of this experiment (November) mink fed 50 % dehulled oats gained even more than did the mink whose diet contained only barley as a cereal source. The differences in skin length, weight and characteristics were small and not significant (Table 3). Blue fox In the digestibility trial mean final weights of blue foxes were equal in all diets (Figure 1, 7355 - 7687 g). Average daily gain of blue foxes varied between 77. 4 - 81. 5 g. Final average weights varied from 13. 49 to 13. 75 kg (Figure 4). The differences in skin length, weight and characteristics were small (Table 4). Only quard hair quality, in the group 8 % dehulled oats became better than in other groups. Discussion Somewhat poorer weight gain in mink in the groups of 8 and 16 % dehulled oats did ot confirm the results of digestibility trial, where the difference in digestibility was not seen. The preliminary results of the digestibility trial show that both dehulled and naked oats diets were highly digestible. The difference may originate from looser and softer consistencys of dehulled oats diets. Dehulled oats finer particle size (2 mm) resulted in looser and softer consistency and probably led to feed waste from the wire mesh. The problem arose only with mink because the mink cages did not have feeding trays. In contrast, blue fox fed with the same experimental feed gained similarly to other diets. Van Barneveld et. al (1997) also studied digestibility of naked and dehulled oats in growing pigs and found that both dehulled and naked oats have very high amino acid digestibility. These results indicate that both naked and dehulled oats can promote good weight gain both in mink and blue foxes. Naked oats have been included in commercial young pigs diets with positive growth responses. Dehulled and naked oats have even been found very good feed ingredients for dogs. Amino acid content and profile oats is better than in corn Kempe et al. (2004). Our results, both digestibility data, growth and fur properties show that dehulled and naked oats are suitable ingredients in mink and blue fox diets. Naked oats is a new crop and not yet widely cultivated in Finland. Recent studies have shown that some varieties produce yields as high as <b>common</b> <b>oats</b> (Kangas et al., 2001). Hence, naked and dehulled oats will have a potential as a feed ingredient in fur bearing animal diets. References van Barneveld, R. J., Szarvas, S. R. and Barr, A. R. (1998).

40|$|Oat is {{the third}} most {{important}} cereal crop in Sweden and Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease makes the oat grain incompatible for animal and human consumption by producing secondary metabolites called mycotoxins. T- 2, HT- 2 and deoxynivalenol (DON) are the most <b>common</b> mycotoxins in <b>oats</b> produced by Fusarium spp. In this experiment, eight cultivars of oat plants were inoculated with F. langsethiae and/or F. graminearum and grown in a growth chamber. The Fusarium infection were quantified by using real time PCR and T- 2 and DON concentrations were determined by using enzyme immunoassay. The result demonstrates that infection level varied for F. langsethiae. In some oat cultivars there was a higher infection level of F. langsethiae when this species were single inoculated and for some cultivars the infection of F. langsethiae was more severe when co-inoculated with F. graminearum. The same pattern is also true for F. graminearum. The amount of F. graminearum DNA and the DON concentration were strongly correlated (r = 0. 618, P= 0. 00) as were {{the correlation between the}} amount of F. langsethiae DNA and T- 2 toxin (P= 0. 002, r = 0. 517) ...|$|R
40|$|In two feeding trials, {{the use of}} whey, steam rolled {{or ground}} oats, {{fishmeal}} or meat and bone scraps in starter diets for the weaned pig was evaluated. In Trial I, pigs fed the basal corn-soybean meal diet gained 5 % slower than pigs fed diets containing 8. 75 % whey, with either 8. 75 % steam rolled or ground oats and 2. 5 % fishmeal or meat and bone scraps. The pounds of feed required per pound of gain were similar for all diets, resulting in the cheapest gain with the corn-soybean meal basal diet. In Trial II, 192 lighter pigs were used (13 to 24 lbs., initial weight) with similar results. No significant difference was observed in rate of gain, average daily feed intake, or feed efficiency when whey, steamed rolled or ground oats, or fishmeal or meat and bone scraps {{were added to the}} basal ration.

40|$|Soil health {{represents}} {{the foundation for}} the production of healthy food. Soil conditions influence the soil capacity for agricultural production and the provision of key ecosystem services. Healthy soils are key contributors to biodiversity and are a prerequisite for sustainable development. According to van Bruggen & Semenov [1] a healthy soil can be defined as “a stable soil, with resilience to stress, high biological diversity, and high levels of internal cycling of nutrients”. Soil biodiversity constitutes one of the main components of agroecosystems, being involved in the delivery of several essential ecosystem services such as, among others, nutrient cycling, soil formation, pest and pollution control. Thus, soil biodiversity indicators can be used by governments and farmers to monitor soil health and ecosystem functioning under various land uses and management practices. At present, organic wine represents an emerging market that is showing a high potential for growth. There is, in fact, a growing worldwide interest and attention for environmental friendly products and sustainable agricultural practices which may ensures both the increase of profitability and the improvement of life and food safety. In this scenario, the aim of our study was to assess the long-term effects of organically managed vineyards on soil health by means of two bioindicators: ciliated protozoa and microarthropods. Ciliated protozoa are eukaryotic microorganisms which constitutes an essential component of the soil microbial loop. By feeding on bacterial biomass ciliates play an essential role in the liberation of nutrients in the plant rhizosphere [2]. Soil microarthropods play crucial roles in regulating ecosystem processes and functions by influencing organic matter decomposition (pre-decomposers) and facilitating the microbial activity, soil porosity and water infiltration [3]. Both ciliates and microarthropods are very sensitive to changes in their habitat and fluctuations in their communities can affect the food web and the energy transfer within the soil ecosystem. Thus, the monitoring of the structure of microarthropod and ciliate communities represents a valuable tool to assess soil health and functioning. The study was realized in the terroir of Verdicchio di Matelica (Marche, Italy), on 3 vineyard plots belonging to the commercial wine farm Collestefano, that were organically managed since 1992 (V 92, 19 years), 1998 (V 98, 13 years) and 2009 (V 09, 2 years) respectively. In each vineyard, soil samples (0 - 10 cm depth) were taken every month from March to October 2011. For microarthropods, the measured biological parameters were: the Soil Biological Quality (QBS-ar) index [4], abundances of biological and euedaphic forms (BF & EF) and diversity indices. Soil samples were collected in both disturbed (tillage) and not-disturbed (no-tillage) inter-rows. In this regards, the wine farm adopted an alternate management of the tractor-rows {{on either side of the}} vine row with tillage and non-tillage annual cover crop species (clover, <b>common</b> vetch and <b>oats).</b> For ciliates: abundances and diversity indices were measured and soil samples were randomly collected in the whole sampling area for a total of 3 sampling (May, June and July 2011). For ciliates, the results of the multivariate analysis (Cluster Analysis and Non-metric Multidimensional scaling) seem to indicate that the most stable habitat for ciliates is represented by the older V 92 followed by the V 98 and the V 09 vineyards. For microarthropods, the comparison between tilled and no-tilled inter-rows in the vineyards V 92, V 98 & V 09 by mean of QBS-ar values and abundances of FB and EF, shows that exsclusively in the oldest V 92 vineyard no significant differences were detected between the tilled and no-tilled inter-rows with respect to QBS, EF and BF values by the non parametric Kruskal-Wallis (K-W) test. On the contrary, significant differences between the two differently managed inter-rows were detected for the V 98 & V 09 vineyards. Thus, and in agreement with ciliate indications, in the V 92 the microartrhopod communities remain more stable than in the other vineyards irrespective of the type of disturbance applied (tillage). Overall, our analysis shows that the biological communities experience less fluctuations (>stable) in the “older” vineyards compared with the “younger” V 09 vineyard (V 92 >V 98 >V 09). As reported also by other authors [4 - 5], this effect may be due to the greater resilience of the soils of the vineyards V 92 and V 98 possible achieved during the long term organic management. In final, this study helps in evaluating the long term effects of common organic vineyard floor management practices as well as, in the definition of possible biotic baseline values to evaluate soil health in vineyards. Furthermore, and in agreement with the guidelines of the European Commission and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, our study contribute to raising awareness among stakeholders and policy makers on the importance of soil biodiversity in preserving soil health (and food safety) and in assisting them to select, promote and stimulate adequate sustainable farming practices by which to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture and move the world toward a more sustainable food future.
