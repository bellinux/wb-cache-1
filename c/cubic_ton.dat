Not many studies have been carried out to understand the behaviour of resin on wood fibre. Sometimes manufacturer’s spray resin more than required which is a waste of material and some time they spray less, which may cause low internal bonding and low modulus of rupture of wood composite. There is a need to develop better understanding, by means of experimental data and modelling. The present model studies the impact of various factors such as resin surface tension, diameter of wood pores, resin contact angle on the penetration rate of resin on the wood surface. The Matlab software is used for programming and running the simulations.

40|$|The wood {{composite}} industry in Malaysia comprises of 12 MDF and 10 particleboard plants with an installed capacity of about 5 million tons per year. The {{total production capacity}} is approx 2. 5 million <b>cubic</b> <b>ton.</b> Most of the MDF boards are exported to US,Europe and Asian market. At present formaldehyde based adhesive such as urea formaldehyde(UF) and phenol formaldehyde(PF) is used as the binder. The main problem with these adhesives is continuous emission of formaldehyde vapors that are carcinogenic in nature. A number of developed countries have put ban on the import of these boards. The objective {{of this research is}} to modify the lignin content of wood fibers by using soy flour which is available in Malaysia. This modified lignin based adhesive is expected to replace the use of artificial resins like UF and PF and because of commonly available soy flour it will be economical and eco friendly. The fiberboards were prepared from three different adhesives, which are urea formaldehyde (UF) resins, natural adhesive (lignin) and protein-lignin based adhesives. Hot pressing at constant temperature 180 ºC and pressure 2 MPa within 4 minutes pressing was done to form the boards. For each board were tested for mechanical properties including modulus of rupture (MOR),thickness swelling (TS) and internal bond strength (IB). Results showed that SF,lignin,acetic acid (CH 3 COOH) and sodium hydroxide were all essential components for the adhesive and the SF: lignin:CH 3 COOH weight ratio of 3 : 75 : 10 with pH 11 resulted in the highest value of MOR, IB strength and water resistance.

40|$|The forest {{sectors in}} many regions and {{countries}} are facing a need to change their structure, due {{to the development of}} new markets, emergence of new competitors, and shifts in production and consumption patterns for forest products. This article focuses on recent changes in the trade in these products, on imports and exports of four countries (USA, Sweden, Ukraine and, to a lesser extent, China) during the period from 1995 to 2011. For this purpose we use explanatory data analysis, time series analysis, benchmarking, meta-synthesis and content analysis of scientific and business publications concerning national and global trends in forest product industries. Data sources are various organizations’ databases of international trade in forest-based products in both monetary and physical terms (<b>cubic</b> meters and <b>tons).</b> The results show that the US and Swedish forest sectors are adversely affected by downturns in both their domestic and foreign markets during the study period, while the Ukrainian sector maintains exports of low value-added products at roughly constant levels (except that particle-board exports increase). China maintains production quantities of low value-added forest-based products, but also substantially increases exports of high-value added products. The results may facilitate efforts to forecast future trends and provide useful information and methodological approaches for future studies of interest to industry representatives, policy-makers and researchers...|$|R
40|$|Issue: Wood waste {{processors}} must set {{a tipping}} fee (receiving charge) that allows their {{business to be}} profitable. The tipping fee must cover expenses yet, remain competitive with other local recycling or disposal options. Also, an acceptable profit margin per unit (<b>cubic</b> yard or <b>ton)</b> of incoming material should be considered. Establishing a tipping fee ensures that the facility operates profitably. Best Practice: This Best Practice outlines the process for determining the tipping fee at a new or existing facility. Implementation: The tipping fee is perhaps the only variable of the facility’s financial system. Therefore, calculating the desired tipping fee requires “working backwards. ” The cost to process the wood waste (processing costs) {{is determined by the}} facility’s monthly operating expenses and payment capital expenditures. The tipping fee (per unit basis) is determined by dividing the total tipping revenue by the material tonnage or cubic yards of incoming material. Therefore to determine the tipping fee, the tipping revenue must first be calculated using the following equation: Tipping Revenues = (Processing Costs + Profit Margin) - Material Revenues where: 1. Processing Costs = Monthly Operating Expenses + Monthly Payments on Capital Expenditures. Operating Expenses. These expenses are necessary costs to remain in business and typically include the following: • Labor; • Disposal Costs For Removed Contaminants • Overhead (e. g., benefits...|$|R
40|$|Methane {{emissions}} {{resulting from}} the release of methane trapped in coal beds can {{have a significant impact}} on the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with coal production. These emissions vary dramatically by coal rank, specific seam, and seam depth and thickness. This is particularly true of underground mines, where 50 of the nation’s 600 active underground mines are responsible for 98 % of all methane emissions. Various methods can be utilized to mitigate methane emissions, although at present these technologies have only seen limited deployment domestically due to lack of clear incentives or other barriers such as unclear ownership of rights to the gas, proximity of methane to market or a lack of desire to invest in new processes. Despite these factors, coal mine methane (CMM) recovery and use continues to grow, with over 46 billion cubic feet (Bcf) recovered domestically in 2006 – a 10 % increase from 2003. [1] The U. S. Department of Environmental Protection (EPA) reports that of the 50 mines identified as potential candidates for CMM recovery (CMMR), 14 mines have implemented recovery strategies. [1] It is expected that deployment will increase dramatically for gassy mines in the event that carbon regulation is passed, due to the potential cost associated with emissions: methane emissions would incur a cost 25 times higher than carbon emissions based on their increased global warming potential (GWP). This paper explores methane content and emissions associated with mining Illinois Basin coals such as Illinois No. 6. Illinois Basin bituminous coals tend to have a higher gas content than other bituminous coals, but the range of values is quite large, with methane contents as low as 10 standard <b>cubic</b> feet per <b>ton</b> of coal (scf CH 4 /ton) and as high as 250 scf CH 4 /ton being reported. As the methane content of the coal does not account for methane which has desorbed into the surrounding rock strata, specific methane emissions resulting from mining this coal will be even higher, with a 50 % increase in emissions expected...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} resistivity of Fe 17 wt%Si alloy was measured within the solid and the liquid phases up to 5 GPa in 200 ton and 1000 <b>ton</b> <b>cubic</b> anvil presses. Special attention was paid {{in the investigation}} to the challenges in resistance measurements {{in connection with the}} contaminations originating from the electrode materials and also the dominant role of the electrode resistances in the final results. The current results on Fe 17 Si alloys yielded insights to the manifestations of the magnetic, order-disorder and melting transitions on the {{electrical resistivity}} at high P, T. A drop in electrical resistivity in Fe 17 Si was observed at the melting boundary at high pressures up to 5 GPa as reported by Baum et al. (1967) at 1 atm. The liquid resistivity results from the present study provide insight on the effect of Si on the electrical resistivity of Fe-Si alloy specifically that the difference in resistivity between Fe and Fe 17 Si decreased with increasing pressure. The model of saturation resistivity (Mooij, 1973) describes saturation of electron-scattering where the electron mean free path approaches the interatomic distance (Ioffe-Regel criteria); the temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) has been shown to change sign due to compositionally-induced changes to the mean free path and interatomic distance. The {{results of the present study}} show that pressure can also provide a mechanism for resistivity saturation and change of TCR sign most likely due to reduction in interatomic distance. The present electrical resistivity results of Fe 17 Si were interpreted in terms of the resistivity saturation model in order to estimate the electrical resistivity of the Earth’s outer core. This yielded a range of 9. 0 × 10 - 7 Ωm to 9. 4 × 10 - 7 Ωm which is in agreement with the very recently reported studies on the electrical resistivity of the Earth’s core.
