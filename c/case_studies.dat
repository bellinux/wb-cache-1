40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} the authors propose {{a more precise}} and encompass-ing {{definition}} of <b>case</b> <b>study</b> than is usually found. They support their defini-tion by clarifying that <b>case</b> <b>study</b> is neither a method nor a methodology nor a research design as suggested by others. They use a <b>case</b> <b>study</b> prototype of their own design to propose common properties of <b>case</b> <b>study</b> and demon-strate how these properties support their definition. Next, they present sev-eral living myths about <b>case</b> <b>study</b> and refute them {{in relation to their}} definition. Finally, they discuss the interplay between the terms <b>case</b> <b>study</b> and unit of analysis to further delineate their definition of <b>case</b> <b>study.</b> The target audiences for this paper include <b>case</b> <b>study</b> researchers, research de-sign and methods instructors, and graduate students interested in <b>case</b> <b>study</b> research...|$|R

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to highlight similarities and differences across various <b>case</b> <b>study</b> designs and to analyze their respective contributions to theory. Although different designs reveal some common underlying characteristics, a comparison of such <b>case</b> <b>study</b> research designs demonstrates that <b>case</b> <b>study</b> research incorporates different scientific goals and collection and analysis of data. This paper relates this comparison to a more general debate of how different research designs contribute to a theory continuum. The fine-grained analysis demonstrates that <b>case</b> <b>study</b> designs fit differently to the pathway of the theory continuum. The resulting contribution is a portfolio of <b>case</b> <b>study</b> research designs. This portfolio demonstrates the heterogeneous contributions of <b>case</b> <b>study</b> designs. Based on this portfolio, theoretical contributions of <b>case</b> <b>study</b> designs can be better evaluated in terms of understanding, theory-building, theory development, and theory testing.|$|R
