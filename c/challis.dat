5|$|In 1845–46, Urbain Le Verrier, {{independently}} of Adams, developed his own calculations but aroused no enthusiasm in his compatriots. In June 1846, upon seeing Le Verrier's first published {{estimate of the}} planet's longitude and its similarity to Adams's estimate, Airy persuaded <b>Challis</b> {{to search for the}} planet. <b>Challis</b> vainly scoured the sky throughout August and September.|$|E
5|$|As Siletzia accreted it also {{jammed the}} {{existing}} subduction zone, halting subduction of the Farallon plate. This terminated the Laramide orogeny {{that had been}} uplifting the Rocky Mountains, and triggered the ignimbrite sweep, a wave of large-volume silicic magmatism that swept over much of western North America between 50 and 20 Ma. This undoubtedly affected the enigmatic and controversial <b>Challis</b> Arc (stretching from southeastern British Columbia to the Idaho Batholith, roughly parallel with the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament), but {{the details of this}} are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{frequent}} derailments, {{low speed}} meant Wotton Tramway {{had a good}} safety record. The locomotives occasionally ran over stray sheep, and on 12September1888 sparks {{from one of the}} Aveling and Porter engines blew back into one of the train's cattle trucks, igniting the straw bedding and badly burning two cows. The line had one serious accident, in which Ellen Maria Nickalls, a servant at Wotton House, was struck by a locomotive near Church Siding and killed. The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death, absolving driver James <b>Challis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Kottick, in his {{authoritative}} A History of the Harpsichord, expresses {{admiration for}} <b>Challis's</b> innovative work, but also notes {{it was something}} of a dead end: during <b>Challis's</b> lifetime, the construction of harpsichords shifted strongly toward close imitation of the work of the historical master builders of the 18th century and earlier. Thus, <b>Challis's</b> harpsichords served as a something of a last hurrah for 20th century efforts to improve the harpsichord by using modern technology. The movement toward historicist construction was initiated, among others, by <b>Challis's</b> own student Dowd.|$|R

5|$|In 1821, Alexis Bouvard {{published}} astronomical {{tables of}} {{the orbit of}} Neptune's neighbour Uranus. Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesise that an unknown body was perturbing the orbit through gravitational interaction. In 1843, John Couch Adams began work on the orbit of Uranus using the data he had. Via Cambridge Observatory director James <b>Challis,</b> he requested extra data from Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, who supplied it in February 1844. Adams continued to work in 1845–46 and produced several different estimates of a new planet.|$|E
5|$|After briefly practising law in 1923 in Britain, Treatt {{returned}} to Australia and {{was admitted to}} the New South Wales bar that same year, serving as a Crown Prosecutor at the supreme court. Treatt also was the <b>Challis</b> law lecturer at the University of Sydney. Treatt entered the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 26 March 1938, representing the Electoral district of Woollahra for the United Australia Party (UAP). When UAP Premier Bertram Stevens was ousted from the leadership in August 1939 and Alexander Mair became Premier, Mair appointed Treatt, after serving only a few months in Parliament, as the Minister for Justice. He served in this office until the UAP lost power in 1941.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Le Verrier {{by letter}} urged Berlin Observatory {{astronomer}} Johann Gottfried Galle to search with the observatory's refractor. Heinrich d'Arrest, {{a student at}} the observatory, suggested to Galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of the sky in the region of Le Verrier's predicted location with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a planet, as opposed to a fixed star. On the evening of 23 September 1846, the day Galle received the letter, he discovered Neptune within 1° of where Le Verrier had predicted it to be, about 12° from Adams' prediction. <b>Challis</b> later realised that he had observed the planet twice, on 4 and 12 August, but did not recognise it as a planet because he lacked an up-to-date star map and was distracted by his concurrent work on comet observations.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Challis's</b> {{work has}} been linked with Louis Johnson (the most influential), Peter Bland and Charles Doyle, all three {{immigrant}} English poets writing in Wellington from the mid-1950s. These poets dealt with personal experience in a contemporary urban, often domestic, setting, and using modernist techniques. Andrew Mason see <b>Challis's</b> most enduring work as more distinctive than the work of those poets. In Building, certain poems ("The Iceman", [...] "The Shadowless Man", [...] "The Thermostatic Man", [...] "The Asbestos-Suited Man in Hell" [...] and its sequel [...] "The Inflammable Man") explore psychological states {{and the development of}} personal identity. Others in that first collection ("The Black One", [...] "The Sirens" [...] and [...] "The Oracle") are an often ironic reworking of myths or archetypes into contemporary situations. The poems are all [...] "linguistically inventive" [...] but [...] "carefully crafted". <b>Challis's</b> poetry published in the twentieth century is characterised by an [...] "apparent distance", almost a [...] "clinical detachment", which [...] "subverts the immediate or expected emotional response". [...] "Beneath that, however, there is a deeper identification with psychological conditions that are unique to the individual yet common to humankind".|$|R
5|$|The Cascade Range was {{produced}} by convergence of the North American Plate with the subducting Juan de Fuca Plate. Active volcanism has taken place for approximately 36million years; the nearby <b>Challis</b> Range features complexes as old as 55 mya. Most geologists believe that activity in the Cascades has been relatively intermittent, producing up to 3,000 volcanic calderas at a time. Frequent volcanism within the last 10,000years created complexes from Mount Garibaldi in British Columbia to north California's Lassen Peak complex. Remarkably different from state to state, the volcanism ranges from large volcanoes to zones of many smaller geologic features such as lava shields and cinder cones. TheCascadevolcanoes are divided into two large sectors, called the High Cascades and the Western Cascades; Thielsen {{is part of the}} High Cascades, which are east of the Western Cascades.|$|E

50|$|The {{idea for}} The Green Green Grass came from John <b>Challis’s</b> real-life situation. John Sullivan, writer of Only Fools and Horses saw how John’s life {{had changed since}} he and Carol had moved some ten years ago. He decided after {{watching}} the episode Little Problems of Only Fools and Horses where Boycie of obviously terrified of the Driscoll Brothers to have him grass them up and do a runner when they are released.

25|$|On 13 February 1844, James <b>Challis,</b> {{director}} of the Cambridge Observatory, requested data on the position of Uranus, for Adams, from Astronomer Royal George Biddell Airy at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. Adams certainly completed some calculations on 18 September 1845.|$|E
50|$|<b>Challis's</b> {{energy and}} drive, his {{interest}} in encouraging new young players and his emphasis on training {{led to the formation}} of the City of Oxford Youth Band and then, in 1970, the City of Oxford Junior Band. On 27 April 1975 the former achieved a world record by playing continuously for 28 hours and 45 minutes, witnessed by Roy Castle (presenter of BBC Record Breakers and an honorary vice-president of the band at the time). In August 1976 the youth band also toured the United States and Canada and recorded an LP under the direction of Terry Brotherhood. One of the pieces performed being a specially composed Bicentenary March.|$|R
5000|$|Frankie Trumbauer and his orchestra, {{featuring}} Bix Beiderbecke, {{first recorded}} {{a version of}} the tune in February 1927 to much success. Richard Hadlock has cited Trumbauer's [...] "Clarinet Marmalade" [...] as [...] "a triumph in terms of logical overall structure, melodic symmetry and rhythmic drive, a most extraordinary jazz recording" [...] and opines that Beiderbecke's palette of color through his use of ninths, elevenths and thirteenths and substitution of scales for arpeggios was [...] "about three decades ahead of 1927". Henderson in turn re-recorded [...] "Clarinet Marmalade" [...] in March 1931, inspired in part by Trumbauer's take on it, but with the restoration of the original introduction. Bill <b>Challis's</b> recording represented a [...] "medium" [...] between the different versions, and he also transcribed the piece.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, What's On in London called the film a [...] "sentimental little fairy story...Peter Illing, as Papa, brings this coloured celluloid confection to life {{every time he}} comes on the screen, and Cyril Cusack, as the Salvationist postman, is very good, too. Of course, this is isn't really Soho at all, but I don't suppose that's going to worry anyone except a few fussy Sohoians"; while more recently, the Radio Times wrote, [...] "Pressburger's script aims {{for the sort of}} semi-documentary tone that had become fashionable at the time, but this romance...needed a little local colour to buck it up, not grey sociological pronouncements. Christopher <b>Challis's</b> grim images of Soho have a certain historical value, but, amid a plethora of dodgy accents, neither John Gregson nor Belinda Lee even comes close to convincing"; and ithankyouarthur wrote, [...] "With far grittier kitchen sinks just around the corner, the film looks back rather than forward but still has a cosy charm all of its own and the magic realist tone you would expect from its author and producer." ...|$|R

25|$|A keen {{controversy}} {{arose in}} France and England {{as to the}} merits of the two astronomers. There was much criticism of Airy in England. Adams was a diffident young man who was naturally reluctant to publish a result that would establish or ruin his career. Airy and <b>Challis</b> were criticised, particularly by James Glaisher, as failing to exercise their proper role as mentors of a young talent. <b>Challis</b> was contrite but Airy defended his own behaviour, claiming that the search for a planet was not the role of the Greenwich Observatory. On the whole, Airy has been defended by his biographers. In France the claims made for an unknown Englishman were resented as detracting from the credit due to Le Verrier's achievement.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his third}} collection, Luck of the bounce (2009), the poems became [...] "sometimes light and quirky, often witty, {{occasionally}} self-deprecating but always compassionate". There was a satirical edge {{to some of}} the humour, but (in <b>Challis's</b> words) [...] "never his intention to hurt people". He described Luck of the bounce as [...] "part of a progression in his work" [...] with the poems being lighter and more humorous. His earlier works were [...] "news stories from the unconscious mind" [...] but in his third collection they were [...] "news stories from a more conscious kind of awareness" [...] with direct references to local and every day life [...] For example, the poem [...] "Getting the music (on 91.4FM)" [...] begins: Living under the hill you have to take /the luck of the bounce - /the diffractive spray from waves clipping /just the right rocks. /This is Upper Takaka /this is Golden Bay /twice as far from Nelson /as Nelson is from it. But he retained his interest in more fundamental matters as he engaged in poetry because of its [...] "intensity of its reflection and its ability to make connections with an audience in its endeavours to fathom the human condition".|$|R
5000|$|Veteran Irish actor Dan O'Herlihy {{was cast}} as Conal Cochran, {{the owner of}} Silver Shamrock and the witch from the film's title (a 3000-year-old demon in Kneale's {{original}} script). O'Herlihy had played close to 150 roles before co-starring as the Irish trickster and was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe (1954). He appeared in another twenty films and television series {{before his death in}} 2005. O'Herlihy admitted in an interview with Starlog magazine that he was not particularly impressed with the finished film. When asked what he thought of working in the horror film, O'Herlihy responded, [...] "Whenever I use a Cork accent, I'm having a good time, and I used a Cork accent in Halloween III. I thoroughly enjoyed the role, but I didn't think it was much of a picture, no." [...] Two members of the supporting cast were not strangers to the Halloween series. Nancy Kyes played <b>Challis's</b> ex-wife Linda; she had appeared in the first two Halloween films as Laurie Strode's promiscuous friend Annie Brackett. Stunt performer Dick Warlock makes a cameo appearance as the android assassin. Warlock had earlier co-starred as Michael Myers in Halloween II. Jamie Lee Curtis also provided uncredited voice work as the Santa Mira curfew announcer and the telephone operator.|$|R
50|$|Carrington {{was born}} at Chelsea, the second son of Richard Carrington, the {{proprietor}} of a large brewery at Brentford, and his wife Esther Clarke Aplin. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1844; but, though destined for the church, rather by his father's than by his own desire, his scientific tendencies gradually prevailed, and received a final impulse towards practical astronomy from Professor <b>Challis's</b> lectures on the subject. This change in the purpose of his life was unopposed, {{and he had the}} prospect of ample means; so that it was purely with the object of gaining experience that he applied, shortly after taking his degree as thirty-sixth wrangler in 1848, for the post of observer in the University of Durham. He entered upon his duties there in October 1849, but soon became dissatisfied with their narrow scope. The observatory was ill supplied with instruments, and the leisure left him for study served only to widen his aims. Bessel's and Argelander's star-zones, above all, struck him as a model for imitation, and he resolved to complete by extending them to the pole. Desirous of advancing so far beyond his predecessors as to include in his survey stars of the tenth magnitude, he vainly applied for a suitable instrument, and at last, hopeless of accomplishing any part of his design at Durham, or of benefiting by any further stay, he resigned his position there in March 1852. He had not, however, been idle. Some of his observations, especially of minor planets and comets, made with a Fraunhofer equatoreal of 6½ inches aperture, had been published, in a provisional state, in the ‘Monthly Notices’ and ‘Astronomische Nachrichten,’ and the whole were definitively embodied in a volume entitled ‘Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Observatory of the University, Durham, from October 1849 to April 1852’ (Durham, 1855). His admission {{as a member of the}} Royal Astronomical Society, 14 March 1851, conveyed a prompt recognition of his exceptional merits as an observer.|$|R

25|$|A similar {{theory was}} worked out mathematically by James <b>Challis</b> from 1859 to 1876.

If the wavelength is small, the bodies repel each other. By a combination of these effects, he also tried to explain all other forces.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the estate}} of John Henry <b>Challis</b> was bequeathed to the university, which {{received}} a sum of £200,000 in 1889.
