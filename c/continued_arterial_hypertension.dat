40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} {{is common}} supraventricular arrhythmia associated with <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension.</b> The mechanisms that affect <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> causing atrial fibrillation are various and include: left ventricle hypertrophy, myocardial ischemia, left ventricle impaired function and left atrium enlargement. The {{aim of the}} study was to determine the size of the left atrium in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> patients. The investigation comprised a group of 117 paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patients. Of this number, 87 patients had <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension,</b> and 30 patients were without <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> and other disorders and diseases (LONE). The <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> patients were divided into 3 groups: the <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> patients, those without left ventricle hypertrophy and without ischemia; the <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> patients, those with left ventricle hypertrophy but without ischemia and the <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> patients with concomitant ischemic heart disease. The patients without <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> and other disorders and diseases (LONE) represented the fourth group. The size of the left atrium was recorded by echocardiography. The highest average left atrium size value was found in the <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> patients, those with concomitant ischemic heart disease and it was 43, 39 mm; in the <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> patients with left ventricle hypertrophy but without ischemia, it amounted to 39, 85 mm. The average left atrium size value in <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> patients, those without left ventricle hypertrophy and without ischemia was 37, 24 mm, and the lowest average left atrium size value was in the patients without <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> (LONE) and it was 34, 61 mm. On this number, 80. 95 % of <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> patients, those with concomitant ischemic heart disease as well as 45. 45 % of <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> patients with left ventricle hypertrophy and without ischemia had the enlarged left atrium. The patients without <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> (LONE) did not have the enlarged left atrium. It may be concluded that the left atrium size in the <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> patients in the presence of left ventricle hypertrophy, and especially with the concomitant ischemic heart disease, represents a significant prerequisite for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation genesis. The highest percentage of the patients with enlarged left atrium in the group with <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> and concomitant ischemic heart disease proves that the ischemic heart disease is the most common arrhythmic factor. The left ventricle hypertrophy immediately follows the ischemic heart disease...|$|R

METHODS: In this multicentre study, children with pulmonary <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> were included and followed prospectively for two years at 21 referral centres in France.

Systemic evaluation of cardiovascular diseases in patients with systemic <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> is imperative for prevention. Objectives The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate and inter-relate sex and age with systemic <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> and cardiovascular diseases. Methods Medical records of patients with systemic <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> and cardiovascular disease were evaluated. Data from the medical records were recorded in a prescribed protocol and the data were analyzed and correlated to the patients’ age and sex. Results A total of 170 medical records for patients who visited the cardiology department were reviewed. Of these, 50 patients had systemic <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> and 19 of this subset had cardiovascular diseases. When we correlated systemic <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> with age, we observed that patients in the 51 - 60 years age group were more prone to systemic <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> (36 %). Most of the patients with both systemic <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> and cardiovascular disease were female and in the 61 - 70 years age group, while among males the highest rate of occurrence was seen in the 51 - 60 years age group. The correlation coefficient (r) was 0. 62, indicating a moderate, positive, linear relationship between systemic <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> and cardiovascular disease.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether there is any influence of systemic <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> on the peripheral auditory system. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study that investigated 40 individuals between 30 and 50 years old, who were divided into groups with and without systemic <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension,</b> using data from high-frequency audiometry, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions. The results were compared with those from groups of normal-hearing individuals, with and without systemic <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension,</b> who underwent the pure-tone audiometry test. All individuals also underwent the following procedures: otoscopy, acoustic immittance measures, pure-tone audiometry at frequencies from 250 to 16000 Hz, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions test and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions test. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was observed between the groups with and without systemic <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> in either conventional or high-frequency audiometry. Regarding transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions, there was a trend toward statistical significance whereby the systemic <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> group showed lower results. Regarding distortion-product otoacoustic emissions, the systemic <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> group showed significantly lower results at the following frequencies: 1501, 2002, and 3003 Hz. A discriminant analysis indicated that the distortion-product otoacoustic emissions variables best distinguished individuals with and without systemic <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension.</b> CONCLUSION: Data from this study suggest cochlear dysfunction in individuals with systemic <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> because their otoacoustic emission results were lower {{than those in the}} systemic <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension</b> group...|$|R
