"Thank you, Mr. Black," [...] {{returned}} Wallace; [...] "of course I shall only be too glad {{to escape}} from the consequences of my unfortunate position; but do not misunderstand me: although neither a spy nor a <b>Covenantor</b> I am a loyal subject, and would not now be a deserter if that character had not been forced upon me, first by the brutality of the soldiers with whom I was banded, and then by the insolence of my comrade-in-arms to your daughter--" ...|$|E
50|$|A {{covenant}} {{made with}} the owner of land is {{for the benefit of}} the land. It followed that the covenant can be enforced against the <b>covenantor</b> whether or no he owned any estate in the land, and also against successors in title.|$|E
5000|$|The {{covenant}} must be {{intended to}} run with the <b>covenantor's</b> land.|$|R
50|$|The rule in Halsall v Brizell {{is limited}} to cases where the benefit {{can be linked to}} a {{specific}} burden and where the <b>covenantor's</b> successors in title can physically elect to take the benefit. For example, a restrictive covenant to contribute to the maintenance costs of a common area will not be binding if the <b>covenantor's</b> successors in title have no legal right to use them.|$|R
25|$|In September 1996, {{the concept}} of {{dedicated}} covenants was launched. Now renamed dedicated donations, these were one-off payments of £25 to £25,000 to sponsor a particular part.

50|$|By 1651 the Scottish <b>Covenantor</b> Government was {{no longer}} in {{agreement}} with the English Parliament of Oliver Cromwell. Sir James Grant of Grant, 16th Chief, led the clan to fight for Charles I and the Royalists at the Battle of Worcester in 1651. Also, an alliance between Sir James Grant and the Earl of Huntly led to the annihilation of the Clan Farquharson.|$|E
50|$|The Battles of Invercarron and Carbisdale {{took place}} in 1650 during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms close {{to the village of}} Culrain, which lies to the West of Bonar Bridge. The battles were fought between the forces of the Scottish <b>Covenantor</b> Government and royalist forces loyal to the King, led by James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose. The royalists were defeated.|$|E
25|$|In October 1999 a £250,000 {{appeal was}} {{launched}} {{to fund the}} boiler, whose absence was noticeable with Tornado then comprising a wheeled frame with completed cab and smokebox. As Tornado began {{to look like a}} locomotive with the mating of the frame with the wheelset in the Autumn of 2000, fundraising progress increased, breaking previous records by recruiting 100 new <b>covenantors</b> in two months. By 2005, the trust had raised over £1.5m.|$|R
2500|$|The trust {{has used}} Deeds of Covenant {{since the start}} of the project in 1990, marketed under the slogan [...] "Build a main line loco for the price of a pint of beer a week!" [...] <b>Covenantors</b> can wear a special A1 Trust tie and pay a fixed amount monthly by {{standing}} order, and for this they receive honour roll recognition, event and viewing priority, regular trust publications and the right to attend the annual conventions.|$|R
25|$|The trust {{had a major}} {{crisis in}} 2001 when a {{volunteer}} made several allegations to <b>covenantors</b> regarding defects, over several months. The issue was resolved {{to the satisfaction of}} the trust's auditors, VAB and the Charity Commissioners, although the crisis was estimated to have cost £31,500 in lost income, £150,000 in management time, and a 5 figure sum for an independent engineering survey. In addition, it was estimated to have put back the completion date for Tornado by 2 years.|$|R
50|$|In {{his role}} as Secretary of State for Scotland, after the victory of Kilsyth removed the last local <b>Covenantor</b> army, he carried the {{commission}} to the victorious Montrose for the summoning of a free Scottish parliament. When Montrose marched towards England Sir Robert was captured {{at the battle of}} Philiphaugh and after his surrender, tried and executed by his captors. He was beheaded using an early Scots execution machine called the maiden at St. Andrews.|$|E
50|$|The {{house was}} built around 1500 by John Dalston and {{incorporated}} a Peel tower and a baronial hall. An inscription below the parapet says JOHN DALLSTON ELSABET MI WYF MAD YS BYLDYNG. A west wing was added in 1556. The house remained {{in the possession of}} the Dalston family for many generations, of whom several were sheriffs and MPs for the county of Cumberland. During the Siege of Carlisle, Sir George Dalston was forced to flee Dalston Hall when General Leslie requisitioned it as the <b>Covenantor</b> headquarters.|$|E
50|$|At common law, {{the burden}} of a {{restrictive}} covenant does not run except where strict privity of estate (a landlord/tenant relationship) exists. The burden can be enforced at law in limited circumstances under the benefit/burden test - that is, whoever takes the benefit must also shoulder the burden. In Halsall v Brizell 1957 Ch 169, a covenant requiring the upkeep of roads was found to bind the successor in title to the original <b>covenantor</b> because he had elected to take the benefit. A positive burden can run in law, but not in equity.|$|E
2500|$|However, on BBC Radio 4's You and Yours, current {{chairman}} Mark Allatt {{suggested that}} a further locomotive could be possible, saying [...] "We've got debts of £832,000, about half {{of which is a}} bond issue, and about half again of that is loans from individuals. Our business plan shows that if, as long as we continue with operating the tours we've planned to, and then our <b>covenantors</b> - who have been so generous over so long - stick with us, we can pay that back, and, the quicker we pay that back, the quicker we can start building a new engine".|$|R
50|$|Among the Scythians, the <b>covenantors</b> {{would allow}} their blood to drip into a cup; {{the blood was}} {{subsequently}} mixed with wine and drunk by both participants. Every man was limited to having at most three blood brotherhoods at any time, lest his loyalties be distrusted; as a consequence, blood brotherhood was highly sought after and often preceded by a lengthy period of affiliation and friendship (Lucian, Toxaris). 4th-century BC depictions of two Scythian warriors drinking from a single drinking horn (most notably in a gold appliqué from Kul-Oba) {{have been associated with}} the Scythian oath of blood brotherhood.|$|R

50|$|In April 1640, when {{parliament}} reassembled for the Short Parliament Dalston {{was elected}} MP for Cumberland again. He was re-elected in November 1640 for the Long Parliament but was disabled {{for supporting the}} king in 1643. In the 1644-5 Siege of Carlisle {{he was forced to}} flee Dalston Hall when General Leslie requisitioned it as the <b>Covenantor</b> headquarters. Dalston died in September 1657 and his funeral sermon was preached by Jeremy Taylor. He had married Catharine Thornworth, daughter of John Thornworth, of Halsted, Leicestershire. Their son William was MP for Carlisle and a supporter of the king.|$|E
50|$|In 1642, Alexander Leslie, 1st Earl of Leven, went to Ireland {{and held}} command {{alongside}} Robert Munro (d. 1680) of the Scottish Army. They {{were sent to}} put down a rebellion of Irishmen who had killed Scotts in Ulster. In 1644, Alexander Leslie, 1st Earl of Leven, commanded Scottish <b>Covenantor</b> forces to victory over English Royalists at the Battle of Marston Moor in 1644. This battle was the largest battle of the English and Scottish Civil War, {{and one of the}} most decisive. It resulted in a Parliamentarian victory, which meant that the north of England was effectively lost to King Charles for the rest of the war.|$|E
5000|$|A {{covenant}} {{is a type}} {{of contract}} in which the <b>covenantor</b> makes a promise to a covenantee to do (affirmative covenant) or not do some action (negative covenant). In real property law, the term real covenants is used for conditions tied to the use of land. A [...] "covenant running with the land", also imposes duties or restrictions upon the use of that land regardless of the owner. Restrictive covenants are somewhat similar to easements and equitable servitudes, leading to some discussion about whether these concepts should be unified; the Restatement (Third) of Property takes steps to merge these concepts as servitudes. Real covenant law in the United States has been referred to as an [...] "unspeakable quagmire" [...] by one court.|$|E
2500|$|The inaugural {{train was}} formed of a rake of eight carriages, formed (from the front) of three [...] "blood and custard" [...] liveried coaches, four green liveried coaches, {{and a special}} rear coach. This rear coach was a {{restored}} LNER beavertail observation car. This train departed at 10.15 am from Quorn and Woodhouse station, and ran non-stop to Leicester North station, back to Loughborough, and then to Quorn. Five trains in all ran on this first day, with all special services being restricted to those involved with the Trust, with Tornado running around in a non-platform passing loop at Loughborough Central. On this day, 1,000–2,000 <b>covenantors,</b> donors and guests travelled on the service.|$|R
50|$|Later {{during the}} Scottish Civil War of the 17th century the Mackenzies were {{was still in}} {{possession}} of the Castle Chanonry of Ross. Their chief George Mackenzie, 2nd Earl of Seaforth supported the Scottish <b>Covenantors</b> and in 1646 {{the leader of the}} royalist army, James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose laid siege to the castle and took it from the Mackenzies after a siege of four days. In 1649, after the Siege of Inverness (1649), David Leslie, Lord Newark, who was the leader of the Scottish Parliament's army, left a garrison in the Castle Chanonry of Ross. However, soon afterwards the Mackenzies retook the castle from the Parliamentary forces. The Parliamentary forces responded by taking the Mackenzies' Redcastle and hanged the garrison.|$|R
40|$|Biodiversity decline {{continues}} apace {{across the}} Australian landscape with a pressing need to redesign land use {{to address this}} situation. The significance of private land increasingly is recognised for the protection and enhancement of biodiversity as landholders inevitably make decisions that affect environmental quality. Biodiversity conservation {{is as much a}} social process as a physical one. Conservation covenants are perpetual agreements under which landholders choose to conserve land voluntarily, primarily for conservation purposes. The role covenants might play in landscape-scale conservation was investigated in north-western Victoria. In-depth interviews with a range of participants were undertaken, with an emphasis on the role <b>covenantors</b> might play as social learning and cultural change agents. Analysis of these interviews offers useful perspectives for understanding socio-cultural dimensions of landscape change and exploring the differing values of production farmers and nature conservation landholders. Consideration is then given to approaches to engaging local production farmers in nature covenants and promoting communication between this group and the largely non-production conservationists who currently form the mainstay of conservation covenants...|$|R
5000|$|Taylor {{was born}} May 2, 1821 in Rockbridge County—home to Sam Houston (b.1796), Robert E. Lee (b. 1807), and Stonewall Jackson (b. 1824)—in the Commonwealth of Virginia. He {{was the oldest}} of eleven {{children}} born to Stuart Taylor and Martha Hickman.In his autobiography, Story of My Life (1896), Taylor describes his grandfather, James, as one of five brothers who were [...] "Scotch-Irish of the Old <b>Covenantor</b> type…who emigrated from County Armagh, Ireland, to the colony of Virginia, about one hundred and thirty years ago" [...] (i.e. 1766). The Hickman family was of English ancestry and settled in Delaware in the late 1750s. Both families [...] "fought for American freedom in the Revolution of 1776" [...] and afterward emancipated their slaves. Taylor’s father, Stuart, was a [...] "tanner and currier—a mechanical genius of his times"; his mother was [...] "mistress of the manufacture {{of all kinds of}} cloth". Both parents, he says, were of [...] "powerful constitution of body and mind…their English school education quite equal to the average of their day".|$|E
5000|$|Robert Walker LJ {{held the}} purpose of s 79 was to remove the {{difficulty}} of expressing an intention to bind successors by allowing that intention to be presumed unless a contrary intention was expressed. However, other covenants within the conveyance {{made it clear that}} successors should be bound, and the absence of such words in the clause in question showed a contrary intention. The covenant was thus merely personal in nature and could not be enforced against successors in title. He said that Law of Property Act 1925, section 79 ‘extends the number of persons whose acts or omissions are within the reach of the covenant in the sense of making equitable remedies available, provided that the other conditions for equity’s intervention are satisfied.’ So it does not bind the successors, but says that the initial <b>covenantor</b> is responsible for the successors. He went on, saying, 'A’s duty is a duty not to make a particular use of A’s land; and A’s duty enhances B’s Freehold or Lease (i.e. benefits B’s land); and A’s duty, when created, is not intended to impose only a personal duty on A.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Wings {{were added}} to the castle in the 16th and 17th centuries. The English diplomat Thomas Randolph stayed two nights in September 1562, and wrote that the castle was [...] "fayer, beste furnishede of anye howse that I have seen in thys countrie." [...] An {{eyewitness}} description of the death of George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly in 1576, compiled by Richard Bannatyne gives some details of how the castle was used. The Earl suffered a stroke, or a collapse caused by food-poisoning, while playing football outside the Castle on the Green. He was taken through the outer-gate to his bedchamber in the round tower of the palace block, which was then called the [...] "New Warke of Strathbogie." [...] The Earl's bedchamber was adjacent to his [...] "Grit Chalmer", the Great Chamber. After the Earl died, his body was laid out in the [...] "Chamber of Dais", another name for the Great Chamber, and his valuables were secured in the bedchamber. After the Earl's steward left the Castle a number of alleged supernatural events occurred beginning with the sudden collapse of one of the servants in the [...] "Laich Chalmer", Low Chamber. This [...] "Laich Chalmer" [...] was {{in another part of the}} castle, under a stair opposite the [...] "Auld Hall." [...] On the following day a servant went up to the Gallery at the top of the [...] "New Warke" [...] where spices (which were precious) were stored. This servant and two companions also collapsed and when revived complained of feeling cold. After the Earl's body was embalmed and taken to the chapel, his brother sat on a bench in the Hall by the Great Chamber door, and heard unexplained sounds from the chamber. It was said that [...] "there is not a live thing bigger than a mouse may enter in that chamber with the door locked."In 1640 the Castle was occupied by the Scottish <b>Covenantor</b> army under Major-General Robert Monro (d. 1680). James Gordon Parson of Rothiemay tells us how the house [...] "was preserved from being rifled or defaced, except some emblems and imagery, which looked somewhat popish and superstitious lycke; and therefore, by the industry of one captain James Wallace (one of Munro’s foote captaines) were hewd and brocke doune off the frontispiece of the house; but all the rest of the frontispiece containing Huntly’s scutcheon, etc, was left untouched, as it stands to this daye." ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} stated {{as a fundamental}} requirement of a real covenant or covenant 2 ̆ 2 running with the land 2 ̆ 2 that there must exist 2 ̆ 2 privity of estate. 2 ̆ 2 An examination {{of the nature of}} such a requirement [...] a problem which has troubled many of the great legal scholars [...] has much of interest to the legal student not merely because the authorities are in confusion and discord but especially because it is apparent that here the courts in defining an expression of some degree of antiquity in the law are powerfully influenced by modern and diverse views of public policy towards encumbrances on real estate titles. In certain jurisdictions a policy against such encumbrances is so strongly felt that except as to covenants in leases the obligations of all covenants are in general unenforceable except against the original <b>covenantors.</b> In the majority of jurisdictions in this country, however, covenants may run with the land, but only if there exists privity of estate as defined by the local law...|$|R
40|$|Conservation {{covenants}} and easements {{have become}} essential tools to secure biodiversity outcomes on private land, and {{to assist in}} meeting international protection targets. In Australia, the number and spatial area of conservation covenants has grown significantly in the past decade. Yet {{there has been little}} research or detailed policy analysis of conservation covenanting in Australia. We sought to determine how conservation covenanting agencies were measuring the biodiversity conservation outcomes achieved on covenanted properties, and factors inhibiting or contributing to measuring these outcomes. In addition, we also investigated the drivers and constraints associated with actually delivering the biodiversity outcomes, drawing on detailed input from covenanting programs. Although all conservation covenanting programs had the broad aim of maintaining or improving biodiversity in their covenants in the long term, the specific stated objectives of conservation covenanting programs varied. Programs undertook monitoring and evaluation in different ways and at different spatial and temporal scales. Thus, it was difficult to determine the extent Australian conservation covenanting agencies were measuring the biodiversity conservation outcomes achieved on covenanted properties on a national scale. Lack of time available to <b>covenantors</b> to undertake management {{was one of the biggest}} impediments to achieving biodiversity conservation outcomes. A lack of financial resources and human capital to monitor, knowing what to monitor, inconsistent monitoring methodologies, a lack of benchmark data, and length of time to achieve outcomes were all considered potential barriers to monitoring the biodiversity conservation outcomes of conservation covenants...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} paper {{looks at}} evidence of rank distinction and lineage affiliation among {{participants in a}} covenant recorded on tablets excavated at Wenxian 溫縣, Henan province, and dated to the fifth century BC. The covenant {{is in the form}} of a loyalty oath to a leader, taken to be the head of the Han 韓 lineage, one of the ministerial families of Jin 晉. The text of the covenant is written in ink on stone tablets, each individualized with the name of a <b>covenantor.</b> Tablets with this particular covenant text were found in five separate pits. The number of tablets in each pit ranged from several dozen to more than 5000. The stone-type and shape of the tablets varied within and among pits. I argue that these variations are evidence of distinctions in rank among the covenantors. I discuss a set of four related names from the tablets that appear to support this conjecture. I then look at names, of both covenantors and enemies, in which a lineage name is found. I argue that these names show that it was loyalty to the Han leader, not shared lineage affiliation, which was the main requirement for participation in the covenanting group. I conclude with a brief discussion on the size of the covenanting group, lineages within political groups, and the wider significance of these materials...|$|E
