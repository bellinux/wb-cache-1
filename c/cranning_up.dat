60|$|As Tom Poppins {{finished}} these instructions, {{given in}} the card-player's rapid don't-ask-me-any-more-fool-questions manner, Mr. Wrenn {{felt that he was}} choking. He <b>craned</b> <b>up</b> his neck, trying to ease his stiff collar. So, then, he was a failure, a social outcast already.|$|R

He shall hang {{on the top of}} this Castle of Coningsburgh, in his cope and stole; and if the stairs be too strait to admit his fat carcass, I will have him <b>craned</b> <b>up</b> from without." ...|$|R

My dear Sir Arthur, {{that fellow}} {{has made a}} gull of you above ground and under ground, {{and he would have}} made a gull of you in the air too, if he had been by when you was <b>craned</b> <b>up</b> the devil's turnpike yonder at Halket-head--to be sure the transformation would have been then peculiarly apropos." ...|$|R
6000|$|The actual impulse, however, {{came from}} a young woman who, when next the people had {{streamed}} in, chanced to be standing close beside me. She was a weak-looking thing, yet reminded me in a sorrowful fashion of Fanny. Caught back by her melancholy, empty eyes, I seemed to lose myself in their darkness; to realize that she, too, was in trouble. I <b>craned</b> <b>up</b> from my wooden bolster and whispered in her hair: [...] "Patience, patience. There shall be a happy issue, my dear, out of all your afflictions." ...|$|R
6000|$|She might comfort {{herself by}} the {{perception}} that he was less likely than even herself to recognise the magnum bonum. He would scarcely have thought it honourable to cast a glance upon the medical papers, and pushing them aside from where she had pulled them forward, searched till {{he had found a}} long cartridge-paper envelope, which he laid on the table behind him while he shut up the bureau, and Janet, by cautiously <b>craning</b> <b>up</b> her neck, managed to read that on it was written [...] "Will of Joseph Brownlow, Executors: Mrs. Caroline Otway Brownlow, Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Brownlow." ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{all laughed}} at the pleasantry, and the boat skimmed the faster over the {{rippling}} face of the lagoon. The Flying Scud would have seemed small enough beside the wharves of San Francisco, but she was some thrice {{the size of the}} Norah Creina, which had been so long our continent; and as we <b>craned</b> <b>up</b> at her wall-sides, she impressed us with a mountain magnitude. She lay head to the reef, where the huge blue wall of the rollers was for ever ranging up and crumbling down; and to gain her starboard side, we must pass below the stern. The rudder was hard aport, and we could read the legend-- ...|$|R
6000|$|I was stooping in {{the wayside}} ditch in one more attempt to ease my foot, when once again I heard hoofs approaching. With head pushed between the dusty tussocks, I stared along the flat, white road. A small and {{seemingly}} empty cart was bowling {{along in the}} dust. As it drew near, my ears began to sing, my heart stood still. I knew that battered cart, that rough-haired, thick-legged pony. Suddenly I <b>craned</b> <b>up</b> in horror, for {{it seemed that the}} face peering low over the splashboard in my direction was that of a death's-head, grinning at me out of its gloom. Then with a cry of joy I was up and out into the road. [...] "Hi, hi!" [...] I screamed up at him.|$|R

50|$|The sidings at Chirnside Paper Mill {{were at a}} {{low level}} {{adjacent}} to the Whiteadder Water; the sidings were also flooded and unusable {{as a result of}} the storm, and wagons in the sidings were retrieved by <b>craning</b> them <b>up</b> to the main line, using the Tweedmouth breakdown crane standing on the main line at the end of the viaduct.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the outset}} the films and {{vaudeville}} acts were accompanied at the piano. Billy Good, the pianist from 1920-1922 recalled the very long hours worked {{by all the}} staff and particularly himself arduously <b>craning</b> <b>up</b> at the screen from the rather dingy pit recessed into {{the floor in front}} of the stage. However, the 'pit neck ache' didn't matter since he was 100% engrossed in the music and loved every minute of it playing two houses every night except Sunday for £1-15s-0d. a week. Billy's career changed course in 1922 when one day a potato chip machine took slices from his fingers rather than the potato. He carried on playing 'with left thumb and little finger 'hors-de-combat' but it didn't take 'old Gilbert', the manager, long to notice the difference. He poked his head over the pit rail and said [...] "You young rascal, you've got a bloody cheek" [...] which under the circumstances was rather appropriate, and possibly literally true. So Billy went off to sea to harden up his injured fingers and when the cinema reopened in 1981 Billy Good, by then in his eighties, returned to the cinema to provide musical accompaniment once again to the occasional silent film.|$|R
60|$|But {{when the}} King's archers {{went to their}} tents, they told their friends all that had passed, and how that these four men were the famous Robin Hood and three of his band, to wit, Little John, Will Scarlet, and Allan a Dale. The news of this buzzed around among the archers in the booths, for {{there was not a}} man there that had not heard of these great mid-country yeomen. From the archers the news was taken up by the crowd that looked on at the shooting, so that at last {{everybody}} stood <b>up,</b> <b>craning</b> their necks to catch sight of the famous outlaws.|$|R
60|$|The fishers {{had brought}} with them the mast of a boat, and as {{half of the country}} fellows about had now appeared, either out of zeal or curiosity, it was soon sunk in the ground, and {{sufficiently}} secured. A yard across the upright mast, and a rope stretched along it, and reeved through a block at each end, formed an extempore crane, which afforded the means of lowering an arm-chair, well secured and fastened, down to the flat shelf on which the sufferers had roosted. Their joy at hearing the preparations going on for their deliverance was considerably qualified when they beheld the precarious vehicle by means of which they were to be conveyed to upper air. It swung about a yard free of the spot which they occupied, obeying each impulse of the tempest, the empty air all around it, and depending upon the security of a rope, which, in the increasing darkness, had dwindled to an almost imperceptible thread. Besides the hazard of committing a human being to the vacant atmosphere in such a slight means of conveyance, there was the fearful danger of the chair and its occupant being dashed, either by the wind or the vibrations of the cord, against the rugged face of the precipice. But to diminish the risk as much as possible, the experienced seaman had let down with the chair another line, which, being attached to it, and held by the persons beneath, might serve by way of gy, as Mucklebackit expressed it, to render its descent in some measure steady and regular. Still, to commit one's self in such a vehicle, through a howling tempest of wind and rain, with a beetling precipice above and a raging abyss below, required that courage which despair alone can inspire. Yet, wild as the sounds and sights of danger were, both above, beneath, and around, and doubtful and dangerous as the mode of escaping appeared to be, Lovel and the old mendicant agreed, after a moment's consultation, and after the former, by a sudden strong pull, had, at his own imminent risk, ascertained the security of the rope, that {{it would be best to}} secure Miss Wardour in the chair, and trust to the tenderness and care of those above for her being safely <b>craned</b> <b>up</b> to the top of the crag.|$|R
40|$|For a 2 -category 2 C we {{associate}} {{a notion of}} a principal 2 C-bundle. In case of the 2 -category of 2 -vector spaces {{in the sense of}} M. M. Kapranov and V. A. Voevodsky this gives the the 2 -vector bundles of N. A. Baas, B. I. Dundas and J. Rognes. Our main result says that the geometric nerve of a good 2 -category is a classifying space for the associated principal 2 -bundles. In the process of proving this we develop a lot of powerful machinery which may be useful in further studies of 2 -categorical topology. As a corollary we get a new proof of the classification of principal bundles. A calculation based on the main theorem shows that the principal 2 -bundles associated to the 2 -category of 2 -vector spaces in the sense of J. C. Baez and A. S. <b>Crans</b> split, <b>up</b> to concordance, as two copies of ordinary vector bundles. When 2 C is a cobordism type 2 -category we get a new notion of cobordism-bundles which turns out to be classified by the Madsen-Weiss spaces. Comment: LaTex, 64 pages, revised versio...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we did pretend {{as well as}} we could; but {{everybody}} hugged the port side o’ the ship, and was ready to bolt down below at the shortest notice; and at last, when the beast got <b>craning</b> its neck <b>up</b> over the side as though it was looking for something, we gave it some more grub. We thought if we didn’t give it he might take it, and take it off the wrong shelf, so to speak. But, as the mate said, it was encouraging it, and long arter it was dark we could hear it snorting and splashing behind us, until at last it ’ad such an effect on us the mate sent one o’ the chaps down to rouse the skipper.|$|R
6000|$|Thus left {{to her own}} devices, {{the country}} girl walked into the front room and took off her hat and jacket. It was a low-roofed {{apartment}} with a sputtering fire upon which a small brass kettle was singing cheerily. A stained cloth lay over half the table, with an empty brown teapot, a loaf of bread, and some coarse crockery. Norah Brewster looked rapidly about her, and in an instant took over her new duties. Ere five minutes had passed the tea was made, two slices of bacon were frizzling on the pan, the table was rearranged, the antimacassars straightened over the sombre brown furniture, and the whole room had taken a new air of comfort and neatness. This done she looked round curiously at the prints upon the walls. Over the fireplace, in a small, square case, a brown medal caught her eye, hanging from a strip of purple ribbon. Beneath was a slip of newspaper cutting. She stood on her tiptoes, with her fingers {{on the edge of}} the mantelpiece, and <b>craned</b> her neck <b>up</b> to see it, glancing down from time to time at the bacon which simmered and hissed beneath her. The cutting was yellow with age, and ran in this way: ...|$|R
60|$|If {{you were}} of a very bold conjecture, or of a {{willingness}} to generalize from wholly insufficient grounds, and take the chances of hitting or missing, you might affirm a domestic simplicity of feeling in some phases of functions exalted far beyond the range of republican experiences or means of comparison. In the polite intelligence which we sometimes have cabled to our press at home, by more than usually ardent enterprise, one may have read that the king held a levee at St. James's; and one conceived of it as something dramatic, something historic, something, on the grand scale, civic. But if one happened to be walking in Pall Mall {{on the morning of}} that levee, one saw merely a sort of irregular coming and going in almost every kind of vehicle, or, as regarded the spiritual and temporal armies, sometimes on foot. A thin fringe of rather incurious but not unfriendly bystanders lined the curbstone, and looked at the people arriving in the carriages, victorias, hansoms, and four-wheelers; behind the bystanders loitered dignitaries of the church; and military and naval officers made their way through the fringe and crossed the street among the wheels and horses. No one concerned seemed to feel anything odd in the effect, though to the unwonted American the sight of a dignitary in full canonicals or regimentals going to a royal levee in a cab or on foot is not a vision which realizes the ideal inspired by romance. At one moment a middle-aged lady in the line of vehicles put her person well out of the window of her four-wheeler, and <b>craned</b> her head <b>up</b> to instruct her driver in something. She may not have been going to the levee, but one felt that if she had been she would still have done what it abashed the alien to see.|$|R
60|$|But at {{that moment}} the {{carriage}} began to slow down, and the clank of the hoofs of the riders in front of them died suddenly away. Peeping through the windows, the prisoners saw a huge dark building stretching in front of them, so high and so broad that the night shrouded it in upon every side. A great archway hung above them, and the lamps shone on the rude wooden gate, studded with ponderous clamps and nails. In {{the upper part of the}} door was a small square iron grating, and through this they could catch a glimpse of the gleam of a lantern and of a bearded face which looked out at them. De Vivonne, standing in his stirrups, <b>craned</b> his neck <b>up</b> towards the grating, so that the two men most interested could hear little of the conversation which followed. They saw only that the horseman held a gold ring up in the air, and that the face above, which had begun by shaking and frowning, was now nodding and smiling. An instant later the head disappeared, the door swung open upon screaming hinges, and the carriage drove on into the courtyard beyond, leaving the escort, with the exception of De Vivonne, outside. As the horses pulled up, a knot of rough fellows clustered round, and the two prisoners were dragged roughly out. In the light of the torches which flared around them they could see that they were hemmed in by high turreted walls upon every side. A bulky man with a bearded face, the same whom they had seen at the grating, was standing in the centre of the group of armed men issuing his orders.|$|R
