5000|$|From 1963 to 1977 the Maxey Flat Low Level Radioactive Waste {{facility}} {{served as}} a dump for 832 corporations and government agencies. The site covered 252 acre and consisted {{of a series of}} 52 unlined trenches that are an average of 360 ft long, 70 ft wide and 20 ft deep. Approximately [...] of Low Level Radioactive Waste was deposited on-site. These trenches were capped with dirt when they reached their capacity. Because of the heavy rainfall, soil collapsed into the trenches and they filled with water. It has since been referred to as the [...] "bathtub effect." [...] The water became radioactive and had to be disposed of. Under the direction of President and Chief Executive Officer James N. Neel, Nuclear Engineering Company (referred to in operational documentation as 'NECO'), now known as 'American Ecology' (Nasdaq: ECOL), installed an evaporator and disposed of the accumulated radioactive water as steam from 1973 to April 1986, nearly 9 years after the site had stopped accepting waste materials. The evaporator generally operated 24 hours a day. Approximately six million gallons of liquid were processed by the evaporator. In addition to the trenches for Low Level Radioactive Waste there were [...] "Hot Wells" [...] that were used to store Special nuclear material (plutonium and enriched uranium). The Hot Wells were typically 10 to 15 ft deep, constructed of <b>concrete,</b> <b>coated</b> steel <b>pipe</b> or tile, and capped with a slab of concrete. Approximately 950 pounds of Special Nuclear Material is buried at Maxey Flat.|$|R
40|$|AbstractViscoelastic {{coatings}} {{are often}} used to protect pipelines in {{the oil and gas}} industry. However, over time defects and areas of corrosion often form in these pipelines and so it is desirable to monitor the structural integrity of these <b>coated</b> <b>pipes</b> using techniques similar to those used on uncoated pipelines. A common approach is to use ultrasonic guided waves that work on the pulse-echo principle; however, the energy in the guided waves can be heavily attenuated by the coating and so significantly reduce the effective range of these techniques. Accordingly, it is desirable to develop {{a better understanding of how}} these waves propagate in <b>coated</b> <b>pipes</b> with a view to optimising test methodologies, and so this article uses a hybrid SAFE-finite element approach to model scattering from non-axisymmetric defects in <b>coated</b> <b>pipes.</b> Predictions are generated in the time and frequency domain and it is shown that the longitudinal family of modes is likely to have a longer range in <b>coated</b> <b>pipes</b> when compared to torsional modes. Moreover, it is observed that the energy velocity of modes in a <b>coated</b> <b>pipe</b> is very similar to the group velocity of equivalent modes in uncoated pipes. It is also observed that the coating does not induce any additional mode conversion over and above that seen for an uncoated pipe when an incident wave is scattered by a defect. Accordingly, it is shown that when studying <b>coated</b> <b>pipes</b> one need account only for the attenuation imparted by the coating so that one may normally neglect the effect of coating on modal dispersion and scattering...|$|R

Parameters that affect wave attenuation were investigated with some initial guidelines being established for improved penetration power.

40|$|This is the post-print {{version of}} the Article - Copyright @ 2012 ElsevierLong range {{ultrasonic}} testing is now a well established method for examining in-service degradation in pipelines. In order to protect pipelines from the surrounding environment {{it is common for}} viscoelastic coatings to be applied to the outer surface. These coatings are, however, known to impact on the ability of long range ultrasonic techniques to locate degradation, or defects, within a <b>coated</b> <b>pipe.</b> The <b>coating</b> dissipates sound energy travelling along the pipe, attenuating both the incident and reflected signals making responses from defects difficult to detect. This article aims to investigate the influence of a viscoelastic coating on the ability of long range ultrasonic testing to detect a defect in an axisymmetric pipe. The article focuses on understanding the behaviour of the fundamental torsional mode and quantifying the effect of bitumen coatings on reflection coefficients generated by axisymmetric defects. Reflection coefficients are measured experimentally for <b>coated</b> and uncoated <b>pipes</b> and compared to theoretical predictions generated using numerical mode matching and a hybrid finite element technique. Good agreement between prediction and measurement is observed for uncoated pipes, and it is shown that the theoretical methods presented here are fast and efficient making them suitable for studying long pipe runs. However, when studying <b>coated</b> <b>pipes</b> agreement between theory and prediction is observed to be poor for predictions based on those bulk acoustic properties currently reported in the literature for bitumen. Good agreement is observed only after conducting a parametric study to identify more appropriate values for the bulk acoustic properties. Furthermore, the reflection coefficients obtained for the fundamental torsional mode in a <b>coated</b> <b>pipe</b> show that significant sound attenuation is present over relatively short lengths of coating, thus quantifying those problems commonly encountered with the use of long range ultrasonic testing on <b>coated</b> <b>pipes</b> in the field...|$|R

40|$|When a {{pipeline}} is installed at deep waters the primary design load is the external pressure, hence making the collapse pressure the major design parameter. Pipeline collapse formulas are functions of elastic and plastic collaspe pressure acompanied the initial ovality and yield stress. The most common formulas for collapse are the Timoshenko, Shell and Haagsma equation where {{the latter is}} the least conservative and used in the offshore standard DNV-OS-F 101. In any pipeline system onshore or offshore {{there is a need}} of pipeline protection. The purpose of coating is to isolate the pipeline steel from the seawater, the soil and to introduce a high resistance path between anodic and cathodic areas. Such coatings can be ranging from a few up to around hundred millimeter, thus the cros section of the <b>coated</b> <b>pipe</b> can be many times initial cros section of the bare steel pipe. Existing design formulas for collapse are neglecting the effect of pipeline coating and a study is proposed to investigate if todays practice of neglecting the coating is ac- ceptable. In this project ABAQUS finite element software has been used to examine a <b>coated</b> <b>pipe</b> section with various thicknesses, elasticity and ovality and compared the collapse limit to the values of a uncoated pipe. Based on the assumption of elasticity and material model of coating the results has shown to increase the collapse capacity when the coating thickness and elasticity increases. The values has shown a increase in range of 5 to 25 %. The ovality of the coating however has shown to not effect the pipe collapse capacity in any significant way. Also based on a proposed simple analytical collapse model of serial resistance where the collapse capacity of the steel pipe is added to the collapse capacity of the <b>coated</b> <b>pipe</b> without the steel, the model has shown a good agreement with ABAQUS collapse data and thus is recommended for use in collapse calculation of coated pipelines. For future work a study is proposed to investigate the possibilities of steel pipe wall thickness reduction when adding thick coating to a line pip...|$|R

The pipes’ surfaces wereexamined with respect to scratches, {{and the depth of}} the most prominent ones were determined. Of the two laying techniques, pipe bursting was the one causing the deepest scratches. Horizontal drilling was not significantly worse than ordinary handling during transport and preparation with respect to scratch depth. Dragging of the pipe above ground on asphalt surfaces caused severe damage to the pipe wall. The deepest scratches were seen on two pipe alternatives with soft coatings. Due to thic kness, however, these coatings were not penetrated and thus successfully protected the main pipe wall. The hardest coating tested, a polypropylene alternative, were also thethinnest one, and was penetrated at one location during the pipe bursting test.
