The study also examined the students 2 ̆ 7 attitude toward <b>computer</b> <b>simulated</b> laboratory instruction versus traditional laboratory instruction as a means of conducting laboratory activities;A pretest-posttest control group design was used in this experiment. In this study, the researcher randomly assigned subjects to particular groups. The experimental group received the pretests, experimental treatment, posttest I, traditional treatment, posttest II, and the posttests, while the control group received the pretests, traditional treatment, posttest I, experimental treatment, posttest II, and the posttests;Findings indicated that no significant difference existed between the <b>computer</b> <b>simulated</b> laboratory instruction and the traditional method of instruction as revealed by the mean scores of the posttest I with the pretest as a covariate, posttest III with the posttest II as a covariate, and posttest III with the pretest as a covariate;Findings also indicated no significant difference existed between students 2 ̆ 7 attitude toward <b>computer</b> <b>simulated</b> laboratory instruction and traditional methods of instruction. Results did reveal that student attitudes were favorable to a similar extent with regard to both the simulation and the traditional methods of laboratory instruction;Findings indicated that significant differences did exist between the <b>computer</b> <b>simulated</b> laboratory instruction and the traditional method of instruction as revealed by mean scores of the posttest II with the posttest I as a covariate. The results revealed that the simulation group scored significantly higher than the traditional group. Since the treatment groups switched after two weeks perhaps, the sequence of instruction was an important factor. Also, a significant difference was found between the combined pretests and the combined posttests means of the experimental and control groups. This indicated that both instructional methods contributed to higher posttest III scores;The results of this study revealed that combined <b>computer</b> <b>simulated</b> laboratory instruction with the traditional methods of instruction will maximize the students 2 ̆ 7 understanding of solid state electronics circuitry;From this study, the researcher concluded the following: (1) students learned electronics circuitry concepts more when they utilized actual electronics components and then used computer simulations; and (2) <b>computer</b> <b>simulated</b> laboratory instruction should be used to extend the traditional methods of laboratory instruction...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a method designed to analyse {{the distribution of}} the 2 D-DCT (bi-Dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform) coefficient hierarchy computed over three types of image sequences: colour video, grey-level X-ray CT (computerised tomography) images and <b>computer</b> <b>simulated</b> noise images. This method is a statistical approach which combines in a new way the following four tests: (1) the 2 χ (Chi-square) test on concordance between experimental data and a theoretical probability density function, (2) the ρ (Ro) test on correlation, (3) the Fisher F test on equality between two variances, and (4) the Student T test on equality between two means. Such an approach was compulsory so as to mathematically overcome the dependency existing among successive images in the considered sequences. The results obtained on natural sequences (either video or medical images) are compared to those corresponding to <b>computer</b> <b>simulated</b> sequences, interesting differences being pointed out and discussed. The overall results may {{play a central role in}} a large variety of image/video processing applications: compression, segmentation, retrieval, protection (e. g. cryptography and watermarking). For instance, we successfully applied them to the design of a new robust watermarking method for colour video.
