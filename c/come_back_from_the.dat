5|$|Born in West Germany, Wever {{moved to}} the United States as a child, where he took up {{baseball}}. He played baseball {{in high school and}} the University of California, Santa Barbara, which led to him being drafted by the New York Yankees. After four seasons in the minor leagues, Wever made his major league debut on 17 September 1982. In his debut, he suffered a shoulder injury, which he tried to pitch through for two years before having surgery in 1984. He tried to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> injury in 1985, but retired. After retiring, he opened a bar in San Francisco, which he continues to run.|$|E
5|$|The New Yorker {{film critic}} Anthony Lane {{reflected}} on the sketch and Belushi's performance in 2013. Lane thought that the sketch was an effective satire of the cancellation of the series and simultaneously served as a death knell for the Star Trek franchise. He felt that viewers watching the sketch in 1976 {{would be hard-pressed to}} imagine a future, thirty-seven-years later, where Star Trek was so thoroughly ensconced within popular culture. Lane wrote that Belushi was flawless in his role parodying Shatner playing Kirk. He observed that Belushi both performed an effective parody, while simultaneously injecting his own weariness into the Kirk character. Lane wondered how the Star Trek franchise could ever <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> total deconstruction the SNL skit presented.|$|E

25|$|In The Iron Druid Chronicles by Kevin Hearne (particularly in book two, Hexed), Coyote {{is portrayed}} as a trickster god who {{intervenes}} on behalf of Native Americans {{to protect them from}} a fallen angel that escaped Hell in book one, Hounded.

25|$|The {{fourth day}} saw the turnaround. V.V.S. Laxman and Rahul Dravid batted the entire day, never {{offering}} a chance, {{and ran the}} Australian fielders ragged as Waugh called on nine different bowlers to try to break the partnership. Laxman and Dravid added 335 runs, taking India to 589/4 and a commanding lead in the game. In the process, Laxman set a new individual high score record for India, surpassing Sunil Gavaskar's 236. Laxman was finally dismissed the next day on 281. Dravid made 180, and India declared on day 5 at 657/7, setting Australia an almost impossible target of 384 runs. Australia did not immediately crumble under the reversed pressure; at tea, they were 161/3 for their final innings, and a draw looked the most likely result. Then, the Australians lost 5 wickets for 8 in a span of 31 balls, with Harbhajan taking the first two wickets in the same over and Tendulkar taking the other three. Australia fell for 212 all out, with Harbhajan leading the bowling attack with 6–73. India had <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dead and recorded a stunning 171-run victory to level the series 1–1. They were only the third team in history to win a Test match after following on.|$|E

500|$|The Carol of Lights is {{an annual}} event, {{sponsored}} by the Residence Halls Association, traditionally held the first Friday in December, to celebrate the holiday season.

The Texas Tech Trombone Choir and combined choirs lead the crowd in singing carols and the illumination ceremony culminates with a soloist performance of [...] "O Holy Night" [...] in the Science Quadrangle.

The lights remain on the campus buildings until the first week when students <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> holiday break.|$|E
500|$|EMI {{delayed the}} release of the album in the UK to June 1969, after the band had <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> US and set up a proper tour of their home country. By that time, the band had already {{recorded}} and released their third album Deep Purple in the US, and recorded a single with a new line-up. The Book of Taliesyn was the first release by Harvest Records, a new sub-label which EMI executives had devised as an outlet for British underground progressive rock groups. [...] "Kentucky Woman", with [...] "Wring That Neck" [...] as B-side, was the only single released in the UK in December 1968, but it was retired after only six weeks. Just as it had happened with Shades of Deep Purple the year before, both album and single received little promotion and were widely overlooked, selling much less in the UK than overseas.|$|E

Additionally, GamesRadar used Liu Kang {{as an example of a}} stereotype of gaming heroes who reveal an evil alter ego that ruins the character's appealing traits, and considered him to be [...] "a little like the Shaolin version of Goku, in that he's saved his world countless times and <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dead even more frequently." [...] GamesRadar featured him the article about [...] "kickass Bruce Lee clones" [...] citing his similarities with Bruce Lee and with one of his shouts featured in famous quotes. Liu Kang's darker characterization starting with Deception and in the reboot were received with good critical response as Den of Geek listed him as the 22nd best Mortal Kombat character due to this aspect.|$|E

On the situation, Beaver commented, [...] "Bobby lives in a world where all kinds of strange things are possible. Somewhere along the line, he has a hope that one of these strange, miraculous things might happen to him. I think he is also a realist.

They Have <b>Come</b> <b>Back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Dead!! Ahhhh!" [...] makes references to ghost towns of Illinois.

The track [...] "Decatur, or, Round of Applause for Your Stepmother!" [...] includes references to Decatur, Illinois, but Stevens stated the track also acted as [...] "an exercise in rhyme schemes". Some references to Decatur included in the song were alligator sightings in the area, the equipment manufacturer Caterpillar, and a flood that exhumed a graveyard of soldiers from the Civil War.|$|E
500|$|The disappearances {{led to a}} {{very severe}} crisis of {{confidence}} within the publishing sector, with many booksellers being afraid to sell such books on mainland politics or featuring gossip on political figures.

Some booksellers began to pull anti-China books off shelves.
