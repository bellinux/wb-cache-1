5|$|Exposure to benzodiazepines during {{pregnancy}} {{has been associated}} with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of <b>cleft</b> <b>palate</b> in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and <b>cleft</b> <b>palate.</b> Their use by expectant mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a floppy infant syndrome, with the newborns suffering from hypotonia, hypothermia, lethargy, and breathing and feeding difficulties. Cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero. This syndrome may be hard to recognize, as it starts several days after delivery, for example, as late as 21 days for chlordiazepoxide. The symptoms include tremors, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, and vomiting and may last for up to three to six months. Tapering down the dose {{during pregnancy}} may lessen its severity. If used in pregnancy, those benzodiazepines with a better and longer safety record, such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide, are recommended over potentially more harmful benzodiazepines, such as temazepam or triazolam. Using the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time minimizes the risks to the unborn child.|$|E

5|$|White tigers {{are more}} {{frequently}} bred in captivity, where the comparatively small gene pool {{can lead to}} inbreeding.

Even apparently healthy white tigers generally do not live {{as long as their}} orange counterparts. Attempts have been made to cross white and orange tigers to remedy this, often mixing with other subspecies in the process.|$|E

5|$|According to a {{study by}} Dr. Nguyen Viet Nhan, {{children}} in the areas where Agent Orange was used have been affected and have multiple health problems, including <b>cleft</b> <b>palate,</b> mental disabilities, hernias, and extra fingers and toes. In the 1970s, high levels of dioxin were found in the breast milk of South Vietnamese women, and in the blood of U.S. military personnel who had served in Vietnam.

5|$|Developmental effects {{occur at}} very low doses in animals. They include frank {{teratogenicity}} such as <b>cleft</b> <b>palate</b> and hydronephrosis. Development of some organs {{may be even more}} sensitive: very low doses perturb the development of sexual organs in rodents, and the development of teeth in rats. The latter is important in that tooth deformities were also seen after the Seveso accident and possibly after a long breast-feeding of babies in the 1970s and 1980s when the dioxin concentrations in Europe were about ten times higher than at present.|$|E
5|$|There is {{controversy}} {{concerning the}} safety of benzodiazepines in pregnancy. While they are not major teratogens, uncertainty remains {{as to whether they}} cause <b>cleft</b> <b>palate</b> in a small number of babies and whether neurobehavioural effects occur as a result of prenatal exposure; they are known to cause withdrawal symptoms in the newborn. Benzodiazepines can be taken in overdoses and can cause dangerous deep unconsciousness. However, they are less toxic than their predecessors, the barbiturates, and death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken. When combined with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants such as alcoholic drinks and opioids, the potential for toxicity and fatal overdose increases. Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other drugs of abuse.|$|E

5|$|Being a brachycephalic breed, King Charles Spaniels can be {{sensitive}} to anesthesia. This is because in brachycephalic dogs, there is additional tissue in the throat directly behind the mouth and nasal cavity, known as the pharynx, and anesthesia acts as a muscle relaxant causing this tissue to obstruct the dogs' narrow airways. These narrow airways can decrease the dogs' ability to exercise properly and increase their susceptibility to heat stroke. Other congenital and hereditary disorders found in the King Charles Spaniel are hanging tongue, where a neurological defect prevents the tongue from retracting into the mouth; diabetes mellitus, which {{may be associated with}} cataracts; <b>cleft</b> <b>palate</b> and umbilical hernia. The English Toy Spaniel Club of America recommends that umbilical hernias be corrected only if other surgery is required, due to the risk of surgery in brachycephalic breeds. In another study conducted by the OFA, the King Charles Spaniel was the 38th worst of 99 breeds for patella luxation; of 75 animals tested, 4% were found to have the ailment. However, surveys conducted by the Finnish breed club between 1988 and 2007 found that the occurrences were higher in some years, ranging from 5.3% to 50%.|$|E

25|$|Cleft lip and <b>cleft</b> <b>palate,</b> {{also known}} as {{orofacial}} cleft, {{is a group of}} conditions that includes cleft lip (CL), <b>cleft</b> <b>palate</b> (CP), and both together (CLP). A cleft lip contains an opening in the upper lip that may extend into the nose. The opening may be on one side, both sides, or in the middle. A <b>cleft</b> <b>palate</b> is when the roof of the mouth contains an opening into the nose. These disorders can result in feeding problems, speech problems, hearing problems, and frequent ear infections. Less than half the time the condition is associated with other disorders.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cleft</b> {{secondary}} <b>palate</b> is a {{congenital defect}} {{of the hard}} and soft palate that allows the oral and nasal cavities to communicate. It occurs {{when there is a}} failure of the elevation, apposition or fusion of the lateral palatine processes during fetal development. In dogs, the most critical time period for development and closure of the palate is around days 25 - 28 of gestation. This defect may be inherited or acquired. In mating trials, 41. 7 % of offspring from phenotypically cleft parents developed <b>cleft</b> <b>palates.</b> It {{has been shown to be}} a recessive or irregularly dominant polygenic trait. Brachycephalic and purebred dogs are more commonly affected. Breeds that are at high rist include Boston terriers, Pekingese, bulldogs, miniature schnauzers, beagles, cocker spaniels, and dachshunds. Abyssinian and Siamese cats are also at high risk. Nutritional factors such as hypervitaminois A, hypervitaminosis D, and folic acid deficiency have been shown to produce clefts, as well as drugs such as steroid hormones and griseofulvin. In utero trauma, toxins, and viral infections may also lead to the development of <b>cleft</b> <b>palates...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} dental {{development}} {{and rate of}} tooth development between children with and without <b>cleft</b> lip and <b>palate.</b> Patients: Age- and gender-matched pairs (231 in all) of southern Chinese children ages 3 to 12 years, with and without <b>cleft</b> lip and <b>palate.</b> Methods: Dental histories and radiographs were studied. From these, dental development was determined. Results: Of 2946 tooth pairs in the children with <b>cleft</b> lip and <b>palate,</b> 252 (8. 6 %) {{were found to be}} asymmetric, significantly (p <. 001) more than the 63 of 3179 (2. 0 %) tooth pairs observed in the children without <b>cleft</b> lip and <b>palate.</b> The teeth with the highest frequency of asymmetry were the maxillary lateral incisors (38. 1 %). Differences in dental development on the cleft versus noncleft sides of children with unilateral <b>cleft</b> lip and <b>palate</b> were significant for both maxillary and mandibular teeth (p <. 001 and p =. 039, respectively). The mean delay in tooth formation of the children with <b>cleft</b> lip and <b>palate</b> was 4. 4 months relative to the children without <b>cleft</b> lip and <b>palate.</b> The majority of the teeth in the <b>cleft</b> lip and <b>palate</b> group were delayed by one developmental stage. This happened in 40. 0 % of the maxillary teeth and 30. 1 % of the mandibular teeth.

40|$|Introduction. <b>Cleft</b> lip and <b>palate</b> is {{a complex}} {{congenital}} anomaly of the orofacial system in children. Objective. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the incidence of live-born children with <b>cleft</b> lip and/or <b>palate</b> compared to the total number of children born in the period from January 1, 1990 to December 31, 2007. Methods. Epidemiological investigation was based on the records of live-born children at the Hospital of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of the Clinical Centre Niš. The study included 61, 116 live-born children, i. e. 56, 905 full-term babies. Results. The total number of registered clefts during the investigation period was 43 (22 boys and 21 girls). The most frequent were the secondary <b>palate</b> <b>clefts</b> (44. 2 %); combined clefts were present in 34. 9 %, while primary <b>palate</b> <b>clefts</b> were reported in 20. 9 %.
