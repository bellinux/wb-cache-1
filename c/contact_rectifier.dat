40|$|Abstract—We {{report a}} new structure, called the {{shielded}} Ohmic contact (ShOC) rectifier which utilizes trenches {{filled with a}} high-barrier metal to shield an Ohmic contact during the reverse bias. When the device is for-ward biased, the Ohmic contact conducts with a low forward drop. How-ever, when reverse biased, the Ohmic contact is completely shielded by the high-barrier Schottky contact resulting in a low reverse leakage current. Two dimensional numerical simulation is used to evaluate and explain the superior performance of the proposed ShOC rectifier.

40|$|Progress in high {{electron}} mobility transistors (HEMTs) based GaN, make them relevant candidates for {{high power devices}} with high frequency applications. However there are some issues to be solved {{for the improvement of}} this kind of heterostructures. In this paper, we report on a process to realize TiN/Au contacts grown by magnetron sputtering on AlGaN/GaN Si(111) heterostructures passivated or no. We will present a study on the adequate surface treatment to use before the passivation and thermal annealing. The electrical behavior of <b>rectifier</b> <b>contact</b> was found to be changed by these treatments. The adequate thickness of the TiN layer will also be determined. Reduction of the gate leakage current by as much as six orders of magnitude was recorded by optimization of the thickness of TiN layer associated to a high barrier height...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} {{the effect of the}} {{morphology}} on the optical and electrical properties of the TPyP thin films deposited by vacuum evaporation on different substrates (Si with different characteristics, ITO, quartz and glass). The presence of some well-defined B and Q absorption bands has been evidenced. FTIR and photoluminescence measurements have been used to confirm the preservation of the chemical structure of the compound during the evaporation process. The <b>contact</b> Au/TPyP/Si(n) is <b>rectifier,</b> while a blocking behavior has been shown by Si(n) /TPyP/Si(n) and ITO/TPyP/Si(n) and an injector dominated behavior by Si(p) /TPyP/Si(p) and ITO/TPyP/Si(p) heterostructures. The best transmission was obtained on TPyP film deposited on ITO and the highest value of the current in heterostructures Si(n) electrode characterised by a large grain morphology and in consequence by a weak optical and charge carrier scattering at the grain boundaries...|$|R
2500|$|These {{consisted}} of a resonant reed, vibrated by an alternating magnetic field created by an AC electromagnet, with contacts that reversed {{the direction of the}} current on the negative half cycles. [...] They were used in low power devices, such as battery chargers, to rectify the low voltage produced by a step-down transformer. [...] Another use was in battery power supplies for portable vacuum tube radios, to provide the high DC voltage for the tubes. [...] These operated as a mechanical version of modern solid state switching inverters, with a transformer to step the battery voltage up, and a set of vibrator contacts on the transformer core, operated by its magnetic field, to repeatedly break the DC battery current to create a pulsing AC to power the transformer. [...] Then a second set of <b>rectifier</b> <b>contacts</b> on the vibrator rectified the high AC voltage from the transformer secondary to DC.|$|R
5000|$|Practical {{electronic}} converters use switching techniques. Switched-mode DC-to-DC converters convert one DC {{voltage level}} to another, {{which may be}} higher or lower, by storing the input energy temporarily and then releasing that energy to the output at a different voltage. The storage may be in either magnetic field storage components (inductors, transformers) or electric field storage components (capacitors). This conversion method can increase or decrease voltage. Switching conversion is more power efficient (often 75% to 98%) than linear voltage regulation, which dissipates unwanted power as heat. Fast semiconductor device rise and fall times are required for efficiency; however, these fast transitions combine with layout parasitic effects to make circuit design challenging. The higher efficiency of a switched-mode converter reduces the heatsinking needed, and increases battery endurance of portable equipment. Efficiency has improved since the late 1980s due {{to the use of}} power FETs, which are able to switch more efficiently with lower switching losses at higher frequencies than power bipolar transistors, and use less complex drive circuitry.Another important improvement in DC-DC converters is replacing the flywheel diode by synchronous rectification using a power FET, whose [...] "on resistance" [...] is much lower, reducing switching losses. Before the wide availability of power semiconductors, low-power DC-to-DC synchronous converters consisted of an electro-mechanical vibrator followed by a voltage step-up transformer feeding a vacuum tube or semiconductor rectifier, or synchronous <b>rectifier</b> <b>contacts</b> on the vibrator.|$|R
