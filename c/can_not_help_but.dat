Raphael pictured such infernal villains as Catherine and Marie de Medicis seated in heaven and conversing familiarly with the Virgin Mary and the angels, (to say nothing of higher personages,) and yet my friends abuse me because I am a little prejudiced against the old masters--because I fail sometimes to see the beauty that is in their productions. I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>but</b> see it, now and then, but I keep on protesting against the groveling spirit that could persuade those masters to prostitute their noble talents to the adulation of such monsters as the French, Venetian and Florentine Princes of two and three hundred years ago, all the same.|$|E

It focuses on the polarity and the fixedness of this expression andon its complex complementation. A diachronic corpus study shows that this item is no longer best described as a negative polarity item and that it hasundergone a process of lexicalization. The second half of this article deals with the complex complementation of <b>can</b> (-ed) <b>not</b> <b>help</b> and, more specifically, with the <b>can</b> (-ed) <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>but</b> V-structure. This structure is extragrammatical because there exists no similar construction in contemporaryEnglish.

[...] Is it {{therefore}} so very wise and infallible a guide as to be accepted without other credentials than its name and fame? Ought we to follow its light and leading with no better assurance of the character of its authority than a count of noses of those following it already, and with no inquiry as to whether it has not on many former occasions let them and their several sets of predecessors into bogs of error and over precipices to [...] "eternal mock?" [...] Surely [...] "the average man," [...] as every one knows him, is not very wise, not very learned, not very good; how is it that his views, of so intricate and difficult matters as those of which public opinion makes pronouncement through him are entitled to such respect? It {{seems to me that the}} average man, as I know him, is very much a fool, and something of a rogue as well. He has only a smattering of education, knows virtually nothing of political history, nor history of any kind, is incapable of logical, that is to say clear, thinking, is subject to the suasion of base and silly prejudices, and selfish beyond expression. That such a person's opinions should be so obviously better than my own that I should accept them instead, and assist in enacting them into laws, appears to me most improbable. I may [...] "bow to the will of the people" [...] as gracefully as a defeated candidate, and for the same reason, namely, that I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> myself; <b>but</b> to admit that I was wrong in my belief and flatter the power that subdues me--no, that I will not do. And if nobody would do so the average man would not be so very cock-sure of his infallibility and might sometimes consent to be counseled by his betters.|$|R
40|$|Choosing a {{location}} for vacations and weekends usually con-fuses many people. This concern has attracted considerable attention {{in recent years}} as currently there is no applica-tion based on actual visitors that helps people in finding out the top places for vacations. Online social networks such as Twitter are becoming very popular in last few years and can help in this regard. People nowadays generally do check-ins at new places. Also, analysis of tweets tagged with geoloca-tion and time can provide trends of top vacation spots. In this paper, we present VacationFinder; a novel location-based application that uses geotagged tweets to help people in where they should spend their holidays and weekends. We use real Twitter data crawled since October 2013. We apply indexing, spatio-temporal querying, and machine learning techniques to check, analyze, and filter the user activities in a particular country before and after a specific holiday. We then visualize the results and give our recommendations of top vacation spots for a particular holiday. The paper in-cludes use cases on top vacation spots for Saudis in spring break of 2014 both inside as well as outside Saudi Arabia. Our application <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>help</b> people <b>but</b> <b>can</b> also give direction to governmental agencies about promoting tourism in the country. It can also help law enforcement agencies, ad-vertisement industry, and various businesses such as restau-rants and shopping stores about where to focus during a particular holiday. 1...|$|R

50|$|Unnecessary {{constraints}} {{are another}} very common barrier that people face {{while attempting to}} problem-solve. This particular phenomenon occurs when the subject, {{trying to solve the}} problem subconsciously, places boundaries on the task at hand, which in turn forces him or her to strain to be more innovative in their thinking. The solver hits a barrier when they become fixated on only one way to solve their problem, and it becomes increasingly difficult to see anything but the method they have chosen. Typically, the solver experiences this when attempting to use a method they have already experienced success from, and they <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>but</b> try to make it work in the present circumstances as well, even if they see that it is counterproductive.|$|E

5000|$|Knute Berger, {{acknowledging}} that [...] "we {{are supposed to}} be amused" [...] by the [...] "hippie whimsy" [...] of a Soviet symbol {{in the middle of an}} American city, said that seeing the statue <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>but</b> remind us of the killing and repression Lenin inspired. But Berger reflected that perhaps the meaning of this Soviet relic is the opposite, that it is [...] "a trophy of Western triumphalism", representing the victory over communism and the fall of the Berlin Wall. [...] By removing the statue from its original context where it was meant to keep the Slovak people in awe, given a new context where it oppresses no one and is used entirely in the service of free enterprise and profit making. Berger goes on to compare the Lenin statue with Native American totem poles, so many of which were once on display in the city that they became a [...] "symbol of Seattle". Some of Seattle's most iconic 'totem poles' (actually Alaskan Tlingit carved house posts) were brazenly stolen from an Alaska village by respected members of the scientific and business community, the Harriman Alaska expedition, so immersed in the triumph of their own culture over that of Native Americans that little thought was given to what Dr. Robin K. Wright of the Burke Museum called [...] "a very clear case of theft". Berger said the story of victory of one culture over another told by the totem pole, or the Lenin statue, make it [...] "an icon, but if you know the story, a complicated one." ...|$|E
5000|$|There {{were two}} four-and-a-half-out-of-five's of a nine-out-of-a-ten that were {{garnered}} by the album from The Christian Manifesto, Louder Than the Music and Cross Rhythms. To This, The Christian Manifesto's Lydia Akinola wrote that [...] "I Choose Jesus is a packed full with insightful, thoughtful messages that a listener {{of any age}} could learn from. That makes it a debut {{that we should all}} choose." [...] Likewise, Jono Davies of Louder Than the Music wrote that [...] "I wouldn't describe Moriah as bubblegum pop, that would be unfair. Yet she does have a very pop-feel to her music. I would describe her as sounding a bit like fellow female vocalists Kari Jobie sic and Audrey Assad." [...] Furthermore, Davies said that [...] "The whole album is actually full of very pleasant songs, sung with Moriah's mellifluous voice that you <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>but</b> like. Even if you're a rock lover or a dance raver, this is music that doesn't offend. The album has a mix of songs directly about Jesus and His love, to songs that have very positive messages about living a good life. It's taken me a whole review to work out who I think she sounds like, and it's Philippa Hanna who as you may know, I think very highly of as an artist. They both have rich and wonderful harmonious voices that you could just listen to all day." [...] Davies called it a [...] "Great album." [...] Lastly, Cross Rhythms's Tony Cummings said [...] "With Moriah rising to prominence on the US Christian scene through her vocals in the Veggie Tales DVD 'The Princess And The Popstar' I understandably expected some rather vacuous tweenie pop music on the singer's debut. In fact, there's not an autotuner or a predictable synth riff in earshot and thanks to the sure hand of producer Ed Cash (Chris Tomlin, Bebo Norman) the sound here is organic enough so that one has to take seriously the 19 year old's album." ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Prior theory [...] that is theorising on {{the basis}} of thought and intuition, as opposed to {{attempting}} to explain observed data [...] inevitably distorts what comes after. It biases us in the selection of our data (the data model) and certainly biases any theorising that follows. It does this because we (as humans) <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>but</b> see the world through our theorising [...] we are blind without the theoretical "spectacles" described by Kuhn (1962). If a theory has shown to be essentially correct in some domain (i. e. by thorough validation against the target problem or domain) using it as a framework can be helpful, however, if the theory is not mature or even speculative then it can effectively prevent progress. I argue that, although we can not ever completely avoid this sort of bias, we can minimise its effect. Two sources of prior theorising coming from opposite directions are sociology and formal systems [...] neither of these is inherently biased towards prior theorising,...|$|E
40|$|UNASUR {{currently}} {{represents one}} of the most promising regionalization projects currently taking place. One of its unique characteristics is the high level of security sector integration that has already taken place in the short few years since its inception. This is particularly interesting as it is in stark contrast with the security sector regionalization of Europe. Despite its much longer history of regionalization, European security sector integration is still fragmented into many different organizations with overlapping goals, and whose members often include countries outside the European boarder. In the face of this apparent success in its regionalist ambitions, one <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>but</b> question: What is the logic behind South American security sector regionalism under UNASUR? Furthermore, how and why does its regionalists efforts differ from those of the EU? Through an analysis of how Regional Security Complex Theory, New Regionalism Approach, and Post-Hegemonic Regionalism interpret both the genesis and functionality of UNASUR, one is able to find some important insights with regards to South America’s security sector integration. Geographically contingent security concerns, intensified by the impacts of globalization, has lead South American states to pursuit a unique security arrangement, which rejects the neoliberal orthodoxy and the hegemonic presence of the United States. Unlike Europe, South America’s security complex does not overlap with other regions and, most importantly, does not include the presence of the United Sates. Furthermore, Europe has carried over many of its Cold War era security mechanisms, in large part due to its embrace of the Washington Consensus and the neoliberal economic orthodoxy. This analysis addresses the broader issues regarding the transferability of theoretical approaches across different regions, but perhaps more interestingly it hints at the potential for the wider security regionalization of the Americas, and whether it will seek to align with, or reject the presence of the US hegemon...|$|E
