40|$|The {{markets for}} industrially used biomass <b>for</b> <b>energy</b> <b>purposes</b> are {{developing}} rapidly toward being international commodity markets. Determining international traded biomass volumes <b>for</b> <b>energy</b> <b>purposes</b> is difficult, <b>for</b> several reasons, such as challenges regarding the {{compilation of statistics}} on the topic. While for some markets (pellets and ethanol) separate overviews exist, no comprehensive statistics and summaries aggregating separate biomass streams are available. The aim {{of this paper is}} to summarise trade volumes for various biomasses used <b>for</b> <b>energy</b> and to review the challenges related to measurement of internationally traded volumes of biofuels. International trade of solid and liquid biofuels was estimated to be about 0. 9 EJ for 2006. Indirect trade of biofuels thorough trading of industrial roundwood and material byproducts comprises the largest proportion of trading, having a share of about 0. 6 EJ. The remaining amount consisted of products that are traded directly <b>for</b> <b>energy</b> <b>purposes,</b> with ethanol, wood pellets, and palm oil being the most important commodities. In 2004 – 2006, the direct trade of biofuels increased 60 %, whereas indirect trade has been almost constant. When compared to current global energy use of biomass (about 50 EJ yr− 1) and to the long-term theoretical trading potential between the major regions of the world (80 – 150 EJ yr− 1), the development of international trade of biomass <b>for</b> <b>energy</b> <b>purposes</b> is in its initial stage, but it is expected to continue to grow rapidly...|$|R

40|$|One {{aspect of}} the use of biomass <b>for</b> <b>energy</b> <b>purposes</b> which remains {{controversial}} concerns their full environmental sustainability. Considering the crucial importance of this problem, numerous authors have carried out evaluations of the environmental impact of the various types of biomass by means of several approaches. Although some of these methods are excellent environmental evaluation tools, they are unfortunately unable to manage uncertain input data. Instead, fuzzy-set based methods have proven to {{be able to deal with}} uncertainty in environmental topics. The original contributions proposed by fuzzy logic relate, on the one hand, to the representation of uncertain and vague information, and, on the other, to handling such information using fuzzy rules. A fuzzy inference system (FIS) constitutes the practice of framing mapping from the input to an output using fuzzy logic. In this paper, we propose an application of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference modelling to build a synthetic index to assess the sustainability of production of the biomass <b>for</b> <b>energy</b> <b>purposes...</b>|$|R
