40|$|This guide {{provides}} {{general information}} on specifying acceptable exhaust and intake designs. It also provides various quantitative approaches {{that can be}} used to determine expected concentration levels resulting from exhaust system emissions. In addition, the guide describes methodologies that can be employed to operate laboratory exhaust systems in a safe and energy efficient manner by using variable air volume (VAV) technology. The guide, one in a series on best practices for laboratories, was produced by Laboratories for the 21 st Century (Labs 21), a joint program of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE). Geared toward architects, engineers, and facility managers, the guides contain information about technologies and practices to use in designing, constructing, and operating safe, sustainable, high-performance laboratories. Studies show a direct relationship between indoor air quality and the health and productivity of building occupants. Historically, the study and protection of indoor air quality focused on emission sources emanating from within the building. For example, to ensure that the worker is not exposed to toxic chemicals, 'as manufactured' and 'as installed' containment specifications are required for fume hoods. However, emissions from external sources, which may be re-ingested into the <b>building</b> through closed <b>circuiting</b> <b>between</b> the <b>building's</b> exhaust stacks and air intakes, are an often overlooked aspect of indoor air quality...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{techniques for}} translating quantum <b>circuits</b> <b>between</b> various architectures. Specifically, {{we are interested}} in generic techniques for translating a parallelized quantum <b>circuit</b> <b>between</b> two given architectures which give tight asymptotic bounds on the increase in circuit depth. We approach the problem using a graph-theoretic model for physical circuit architectures. The architectures considered include the complete graph Kn, the two-dimensional and three-dimensional square lattices, the cycle, and the graph of a line, which gives rise to the well-studied Linear Nearest Neighbour (LNN) circuit architecture model. We present results for translating <b>circuits</b> <b>between</b> these architectures, including a generic technique for translating circuits from arbitrary architectures to the LNN architecture. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{elaboration}} of the principle of relay protection against short <b>circuits</b> <b>between</b> the closely placed phases of higher voltage electrical line with self-compensation, based on the six phase’s symmetrical components. It is shown that the unsymmetrical short <b>circuits</b> <b>between</b> the closely placed phases are characterized by appearance of zero and tertiary sequences of symmetrical components. This fact can be used to choose them for relay protection. The electrical basic circuits and formulas for calculation of the passive parameters of zero and tertiary filters of currents (voltages) are done. It is presented the structural-functional basic circuit scheme for relay protection against short <b>circuits</b> <b>between</b> the closely placed phases of higher voltage electrical line with self-compensation...|$|R
