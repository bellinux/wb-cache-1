5|$|In early 1321, Lancaster mobilised a <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Despensers' enemies {{across the}} Marcher territories. Edward and Hugh the Younger {{became aware of}} these plans in March and headed west, hoping that {{negotiations}} led by the moderate Earl of Pembroke would defuse the crisis. This time, Pembroke made his excuses and declined to intervene, and war broke out in May. The Despensers' lands were quickly seized by a <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marcher Lords and the local gentry, and Lancaster held a high-level gathering of the barons and clergy in June which condemned the Despensers for having broken the Ordinances. Edward attempted reconciliation, but in July the opposition occupied London and called for the permanent removal of the Despensers. Fearing {{that he might be}} deposed if he refused, Edward agreed to exile the Despensers and pardoned the Marcher Lords for their actions.|$|E

5|$|The Orkney Movement, a {{political}} party that supported devolution for Orkney {{from the rest of}} Scotland, contested the 1987 general election as the Orkney and Shetland Movement (a <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Orkney movement and its equivalent for Shetland).

30|$|In this paper, a novel {{methodology}} {{is proposed}} {{to solve a}} cooperative multi-depot vehicle routing problem. We establish a mathematical model for multi-owner VRP in which each owner (i.e. player) manages single or multiple depots. The basic idea consists of offering an option that owners cooperatively manage the VRP to save their costs. We present cooperative game theory techniques for cost saving allocations which are obtained from various <b>coalitions</b> <b>of</b> owners. <b>The</b> methodology is illustrated with a numerical example in which different <b>coalitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> players are evaluated along with <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> cooperation and cost saving allocation methods.|$|R

5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the general {{election}} of 2006, Reinfeldt, as leader of the Moderate Party, participated {{in the creation of the}} Alliance for Sweden. It united the centre-right in a <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moderate Party, the Centre Party, the Liberal People's Party and the Christian Democrats. Reinfeldt is said to have been instrumental in uniting the four parties, which previously were known for being notoriously divided, in order to present a powerful alternative to the Social Democrats. The parties presented a joint election manifesto for the alliance.|$|E
5|$|The War of the Fifth Coalition {{was fought}} in 1809 by a <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Austrian Empire and the United Kingdom against Napoleon's French Empire and Bavaria. Major engagements between France and Austria, the main participants, {{unfolded}} {{over much of}} Central Europe from April to July, with very high casualty rates for both sides. Britain, already involved on the European continent in the ongoing Peninsular War, sent another expedition, the Walcheren Campaign, to the Netherlands in order to relieve the Austrians, although this effort had little impact {{on the outcome of}} the conflict. After much campaigning in Bavaria and across the Danube valley, the war ended favourably for the French after the bloody struggle at Wagram in early July.|$|E
5|$|A few holdouts {{remained}} for a time. The island of Monemvasia refused to surrender {{and it was}} first ruled {{for a short time}} by an Aragonese corsair. When the population drove him out they obtained the consent of Thomas to place themselves under the Pope's protection before the end of 1460. The Mani Peninsula, on the Morea's south end, resisted under a loose <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local clans and then that area came under Venice's rule. The very last holdout was Salmeniko, in the Morea's northwest. Graitzas Palaiologos was the military commander there, stationed at Salmeniko Castle. While the town eventually surrendered, Graitzas and his garrison and some town residents held out in the castle until July 1461, when they escaped and reached Venetian territory.|$|E

5|$|Given {{that the}} Parliament does not form the {{government}} in the traditional sense of a Parliamentary system, its politics have developed along more consensual lines rather than majority rule of competing parties and coalitions. Indeed, for much of its life it has been dominated by a grand <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists. The two major parties tend to co-operate to find a compromise between their two groups leading to proposals endorsed by huge majorities. However, this does not always produce agreement, and each may instead try to build other alliances, the EPP normally with other centre-right or right wing Groups and the PES with centre-left or left wing Groups. Sometimes, the Liberal Group is then in the pivotal position. There are also occasions where very sharp party political divisions have emerged, for example over the resignation of the Santer Commission.|$|E
5|$|In September 1839, Juan Lavalle {{returned}} {{after ten years}} in exile. He allied with the governor of Corrientes, which revolted once again, and invaded Buenos Aires province {{at the head of}} Unitarian troops armed and supplied by the French. Emboldened by Lavalle's actions, the provinces of Tucum√°n, Salta, La Rioja, Catamarca and Jujuy formed the <b>Coalition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North and also rebelled against Buenos Aires. Great Britain intervened on behalf of Rosas, and France lifted the blockade on 29 October 1840. The struggle with his internal enemies was hard-fought. By December 1842, Lavalle had been killed and the rebellious provinces subdued, except for Corrientes, which was only defeated in 1847. Terrorism was also employed on the battlefield, as the Rosistas refused to take prisoners. The defeated men had their throats cut and their heads put on display.|$|E
5|$|Major {{political}} parties in Sarawak {{can be divided into}} three categories: native non-Muslim, native Muslim, and non-native; parties, however, may also include members from more than one group. The first political party, the Sarawak United Peoples' Party (SUPP), was established in 1959, followed by the Parti Negara Sarawak (PANAS) in 1960 and the Sarawak National Party (SNAP) in 1961. Other major {{political parties}} such as Parti Pesaka Sarawak (PESAKA) appeared by 1962. These parties later joined the national <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alliance Party. The Alliance Party (later regrouped into Barisan Nasional) has ruled Sarawak since the formation of Malaysia. The opposition in Sarawak has consistently alleged that the ruling coalition uses various types of vote-buying tactics in order to win elections. Stephen Kalong Ningkan was the first Chief Minister of Sarawak from 1963 to 1966 following his landslide victory in local council elections. However, he was ousted in 1966 by Tawi Sli {{with the help of the}} Malaysian federal government, causing the 1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis.|$|E
25|$|Political life in West Germany {{was remarkably}} stable and orderly. The Adenauer era (1949‚Äì63) was {{followed}} by a brief period under Ludwig Erhard (1963‚Äì66) who, in turn, was replaced by Kurt Georg Kiesinger (1966‚Äì69). All governments between 1949 and 1966 were formed by <b>coalitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU), either alone or in coalition with the smaller Free Democratic Party (FDP).|$|R

5|$|The {{almost total}} {{destruction}} of the French fleet reversed the strategic situation in the Mediterranean, giving the Royal Navy control of the sea which it retained {{until the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. Nelson and his captains were highly praised and generously rewarded, although Nelson privately complained that his peerage was not senior enough. Bonaparte's army was trapped in the Middle East and Royal Navy dominance played a significant part in its subsequent defeat at the Siege of Acre, Bonaparte himself abandoned the army late in 1799 to return to France and deal with the outbreak of the War of the Second <b>Coalition.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> captured ships, three were no longer serviceable and were burnt in the bay, and three others were judged fit only for harbour duties owing to the damage they had received in the battle. The remainder enjoyed long and successful service careers in the Royal Navy; two subsequently served at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.|$|E
5|$|While Karl Aloys zu F√ºrstenberg {{fought for}} the Habsburg cause in Serbia, in France, a <b>coalition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clergy and the {{professional}} and bourgeois class‚Äîthe First and Third estates‚Äîled a call for reform of the French government {{and the creation of}} a written constitution. Initially, the rulers of Europe viewed the French Revolution as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. In 1790, Leopold succeeded his brother Joseph as emperor and by 1791, he considered the situation surrounding his sister, Marie Antoinette, and her children, with greater alarm. In August 1791, in consultation with French √©migr√© nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, he issued the Declaration of Pilnitz, in which they declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis XVI and his family. They threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family. The French √©migr√©s continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria. In the War of the First Coalition (1792‚Äì1797), France opposed most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
