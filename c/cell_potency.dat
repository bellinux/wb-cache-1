5000|$|There are {{multiple}} levels of <b>cell</b> <b>potency,</b> the cell's {{ability to differentiate}} into other cell types. A greater potency indicates {{a larger number of}} cells that can be derived. A cell that can differentiate into all cell types, including the placental tissue, is known as totipotent. In mammals, only the zygote and subsequent blastomeres are totipotent, while in plants many differentiated cells can become totipotent with simple laboratory techniques. A cell that can differentiate into all cell types of the adult organism is known as pluripotent. Such cells are called meristematic cells in higher plants and embryonic stem cells in animals, though some groups report the presence of adult pluripotent cells. Virally induced expression of four transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Kfl4 (Yamanaka factors) is sufficient to create pluripotent (iPS) cells from adult fibroblasts. A multipotent cell is one that can differentiate into multiple different, but closely related cell types. Oligopotent cells are more restricted than multipotent, but can still differentiate into a few closely related cell types. Finally, unipotent cells can differentiate into only one cell type, but are capable of self-renewal. [...] In cytopathology, the level of cellular differentiation is used as a measure of cancer progression. [...] "Grade" [...] is a marker of how differentiated a cell in a tumor is.|$|E
5000|$|Recent {{findings}} {{with respect to}} epiblasts before and after implantation have produced proposals for classifying pluripotency into two distinct phases: [...] "naive" [...] and [...] "primed". The baseline stem cells commonly used in science that are referred as Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are derived from a pre-implantation epiblast; such epiblast is able to generate the entire fetus, and one epiblast cell is able to contribute to all cell lineages if injected into another blastocyst. On the other hand, several marked differences can be observed between the pre- and post-implantation epiblasts, such as their difference in morphology, in which the epiblast after implantation changes its morphology into a cup-like shape called the [...] "egg cylinder" [...] as well as chromosomal alteration in {{which one of the}} X-chromosomes undergoes random inactivation in the early stage of the egg cylinder, known as X-inactivation. During this development, the egg cylinder epiblast cells are systematically targeted by Fibroblast growth factors, Wnt signaling, and other inductive factors via the surrounding yolk sac and the trophoblast tissue, such that they become instructively specific according to the spatial organization. Another major difference that was observed, with respect to <b>cell</b> <b>potency,</b> is that post-implantation epiblast stem cells are unable to contribute to blastocyst chimeras, which distinguishes them from other known pluripotent stem cells. Cell lines derived from such post-implantation epiblasts are referred to as epiblast-derived stem cells which were first derived in laboratory in 2007; it should be noted, despite their nomenclature, that both ESCs and EpiSCs are derived from epiblasts, just at difference phases of development, and that pluripotency is still intact in the post-implantation epiblast, as demonstrated by the conserved expression of Nanog, Fut4, and Oct-4 in EpiSCs, until somitogenesis and can be reversed midway through induced expression of Oct-4.|$|E

In this context, we wondered whether bone mar-row stromal cells (hBMSC) would proceed in an osteogenic microenvironment. Based on previous approaches, we devel-oped a fibrin/ceramic/BMP- 2 /hBMSCs compound.

Our data indicate that the method we have developed is reliable, rapid and reproducible to define <b>cell</b> <b>potency,</b> and may be useful for testing cells destined to bone tissue engineering purposes.

Although the {{ingestion}} of contaminated seafood is the most dangerous exposure route for humans, cutaneous and inhalational exposures are far more frequent, and can cause strong inflammatory reactions. However, little is known about the inflammatory events that follow the cutaneous exposure to the toxin. In this study, we investigated (1) the effects of both short (2 h) and long (24 h) term exposures of HaCaT keratinocytes to a sub-cytotoxic PLTX concentration on pro-inflammatory mediator gene expression and release and (2) the effect of PLTX-conditioned HaCaT cell media on undifferentiated (monocytes) and differentiated (macrophages; immature dendritic cells, iDCs; mature dendritic cells, mDCs) THP- 1 cells. At 10 - 11 M, PLTX induced interleukin (IL) - 6 and IL- 8 release from HaCaT keratinocytes after 24 h of continuous exposure to the toxin, as well as after 23 h in toxin-free medium preceded by 1 h exposure to PLTX. Under the same experimental conditions, release of the inflammatory mediators prostaglandin-E 2 and histamine was also found after both short and long exposures to the toxin. The conditioned media collected from HaCaT cells treated with PLTX increased the migration of the differentiated and undifferentiated THP- 1 <b>cells</b> (<b>potency</b> rank order: monocytes ≥ iDCs > mDCs > macrophages) but did not induce cell differentiation.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine the potency of MFL in vitro and efficacy in vivo for intraperitoneal treatment of mice implanted with human ovarian carcinoma <b>cells.</b> METHODS: The <b>potency</b> of MFL was compared to that of other Fas agonists in a cytotoxicity assay on SKOV- 3 <b>cells.</b> The <b>potency</b> of MFL was further determined by measuring apoptosis in combination with cisplatin. The efficacy of MFL was determined in vivo using peritoneal xenograft models of human ovarian carcinoma. RESULTS: In vitro, MFL induced significantly higher levels of apoptosis than other Fas agonists, and was able to overcome the resistance of the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV- 3 to Fas agonist antibody. MFL exerted an enhanced cytotoxic effect when combined with platinum-based drugs, leading to significantly more apoptosis than by incubation with MFL or these drugs alone. Treatment of mice xenografted with SKOV- 3 and HOC 79 ovarian tumors by intraperitoneal administration of MFL alone or in combination with cisplatin resulted in a significant decrease in peritoneal tumor nodules and ascitic cells, and prolongation of survival as compared to non-treated mice. The beneficial effects of MFL treatment occurred in the absence of severe toxicity.
