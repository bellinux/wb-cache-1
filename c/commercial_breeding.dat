25|$|Pharaoh hounds, being {{somewhat}} uncommon {{outside of}} the Maltese Islands of Malta and Gozo, {{and because they are}} not profitable for <b>commercial</b> <b>breeding,</b> have not been subjected to as much irresponsible breeding as some more popular breeds. Breeders try hard to prevent hereditary diseases from entering the gene pool and according to the American breed club, Pharaohs are virtually free from genetic diseases. Reputable breeders continue to test their breeding stock for genetic conditions such as hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and myriad eye conditions just to ensure that these disorders do not become a problem. Reputable breeders should be able to show documentation of health screening performed on their breeding dogs. Note that Pharaohs, like most sighthounds, are sensitive to barbiturate anaesthetics. Their ears are thin and prone to frostbite when in cold climates.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the investigation was to characterize infectious bursal disease viruses (IBDV) circulating in <b>commercial</b> and <b>breeding</b> poultry farms in Ethiopia between 2009 and 2011. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence for VP 2 hypervariable region of ten IBDVs were determined by RT-PCR, sequenced and compared to well characterised IBDV isolates worldwide. IBDV genetic material was amplified directly from bursa or cell passaged material. Phylogenetically, Ethiopian IBDVs represented two genetic lineages: very virulent (vv) IBDVs or variants of the classical attenuated vaccine strain (D 78). The nucleotide identity between Ethiopian vvIBDVs ranged between 0 % to 2. 6 %. Ethiopian vvIBDVs are clustered phylogenetically with the African IBDV genetic lineage, independent of the Asian/European lineage.

Breeding values for slope well reflected the shape of the egg production curve and can be used to select for persistency of egg production.
