It has been already shown that Eringen’s nonlocal elasticity was able to capture the scale effects induced by the discreteness of a microstructured system. This paper generalizes such results for inelastic materials and first presents some results for engineering problems modelled within <b>continuum</b> damage <b>mechanics.</b> The microstructured model is composed of rigid periodic elements connected by rotational elastic damage springs (discrete damage mechanics). Such a discrete damage system {{can be associated with}} the finite difference formulation of a <b>continuum</b> damage <b>mechanics</b> problem, i. e. the Euler–Bernoulli damage beam problem. Starting from the discrete equations of this structural problem, a continualization method leads to the formulation of an Eringen’s type nonlocal model with full coupling between nonlocal elasticity and nonlocal <b>continuum</b> damage <b>mechanics.</b> Indeed, the nonlocality appears in this continualized approach both in the constitutive law and in the damage loading function.

40|$|Material crack {{modeling}} with <b>continuum</b> <b>mechanic</b> concepts can not {{display material}} physical degradation processes in several parts. In classic material strength theory stresses and strains are calculated proceeding from the material deformation patterns {{and based on}} the results obtained from strength formulate hypotheses. So that to introduce to <b>continuum</b> <b>mechanic</b> research of material failure, parameter fracture, and material behavior patterns must be supplemented by material failure (crack growth models). To isotropic, linear-elastic material in existing cracks crack peak area by calculation means is set the so-called stress intensity factor – K. Its numerical value is calculated by exact boundary condition material task with existing crack. Therefore, K - value depends on the design geometric parameters, crack size and orientation, as well as on load and boundary conditions. Boundary condition task’s solution should be performed by the numerical methods and after should be performed crack peak area analysis. Within last decades has been done large number of K-factor calculations for the different crack configurations and different load types. Stress intensity factors form very good basis for the formulation of fracture criteria. Crack growth occurs then when a critical state of material is reached in process zone (crack peak). New approach in the field of crack simulation will be discussed using FEM software code ANSYS v. 11. 0. Material strength evaluation of construction element can be obtained with material fracture mechanics concepts without crack experimental simulation. ...|$|R
