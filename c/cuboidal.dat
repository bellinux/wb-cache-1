5|$|Alveoli {{consist of}} {{two types of}} {{alveolar}} cell and an alveolar macrophage. The two types of cell are known as type I and type II alveolar cells (also known as pneumocytes). Types I and II make up the walls and alveolar septa. Type I cells provide 95% of the surface area of each alveoli and are flat ("squamous"), and Type II cells generally cluster {{in the corners of}} the alveoli and have a <b>cuboidal</b> shape. Despite this, cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 1:1 or 6:4.|$|E
5|$|Epithelial {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), <b>cuboidal</b> or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are {{many different types of}} epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bacterial}} {{species are}} either spherical, called cocci (sing. coccus, from Greek kókkos, grain, seed), or rod-shaped, called bacilli (sing. bacillus, from Latin baculus, stick). Elongation {{is associated with}} swimming. Some bacteria, called vibrio, are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or tightly coiled, called spirochaetes. A small number of species even have tetrahedral or <b>cuboidal</b> shapes. More recently, some bacteria were discovered deep under Earth's crust that grow as branching filamentous types with a star-shaped cross-section. The large surface {{area to volume ratio}} of this morphology may give these bacteria an advantage in nutrient-poor environments. This wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton, and is important because it can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators.|$|E
25|$|Smooth muscle bundles pass {{on either}} side of the urethra, and these fibers are {{sometimes}} called the internal urethral sphincter, although they do not encircle the urethra. Further along the urethra is a sphincter of skeletal muscle, the sphincter of the membranous urethra (external urethral sphincter). The bladder's epithelium is termed transitional epithelium which contains a superficial layer of dome-like cells and multiple layers of stratified <b>cuboidal</b> cells underneath when evacuated. When the bladder is fully distended the superficial cells become squamous (flat) and the stratification of the <b>cuboidal</b> cells is reduced in order to provide lateral stretching.|$|E
25|$|The {{secretory}} epithelium {{is mainly}} pseudostratified, comprising tall columnar cells and basal cells which {{are supported by}} a fibroelastic stroma - containing randomly oriented smooth-muscle bundles - that's continuous with the bladder. The epithelium is highly variable and areas of low <b>cuboidal</b> or squamous epithelium are also present, with transitional epithelium in the distal regions of the longer ducts.|$|E
25|$|Histologically, the {{hypersensitivity}} {{is seen as}} diffuse parenchymal infiltration by lymphocytes, particularly plasma B-cells, {{which can}} often be seen as secondary lymphoid follicles (germinal centers, {{not to be confused}} with the normally present colloid-filled follicles that constitute the thyroid). Atrophy of the colloid bodies is lined by Hürthle cells, cells with intensely eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm, a metaplasia from the normal <b>cuboidal</b> cells that constitute the lining of the thyroid follicles. Severe thyroid atrophy presents often with denser fibrotic bands of collagen that remains within the confines of the thyroid capsule.|$|E
25|$|Secretory {{cells are}} found in a group, or acinus (plural, acini). Each acinus {{is located at the}} {{terminal}} part of the gland connected to the ductal system, with many acini within each lobule of the gland. Each acinus consists of a single layer of <b>cuboidal</b> epithelial cells surrounding a lumen, a central opening where the saliva is deposited after being produced by the secretory cells. The three forms of acini are classified in terms of the type of epithelial cell present and the secretory product being produced: serous, mucoserous and mucous.|$|E
25|$|Hard tissues, {{including}} enamel and dentin, develop {{during the}} next stage of tooth development. This stage is called the crown, or maturation stage, by some researchers. Important cellular changes occur at this time. In prior stages, all of the IEE cells were dividing to increase the overall size of the tooth bud, but rapid dividing, called mitosis, stops during the crown stage at the location where the cusps of the teeth form. The first mineralized hard tissues form at this location. At the same time, the IEE cells change in shape from <b>cuboidal</b> to columnar and become preameloblasts. The nuclei of these cells move closer to the stratum intermedium and away from the dental papilla as they become polarized.|$|E
500|$|There are {{two main}} types of cancer of the esophagus. Squamous cell {{carcinoma}} is a carcinoma that can occur in the squamous cells lining the esophagus. This type is much more common in [...] China and Iran. The other main type is an adenocarcinoma that occurs in the glands or columnar tissue of the esophagus. This is most common in developed countries in those with Barrett's esophagus, and occurs in the <b>cuboidal</b> cells.|$|E

2500|$|Ledoux's {{commemorative}} engraving of 1804 {{carries the}} severe façade right across, unbroken; Ledoux's drawings, executed long afterwards, cannot {{be trusted to}} represent the original appearance, according to Svend Eriksen (Eriksen 1974:62, 66), because the architect was {{in the habit of}} furnishing his drawings [...] "with impossibly advanced features retrospectively." [...] In either version the elevation reflects [...] "Ledoux's efforts to accentuate the <b>cuboidal</b> structure of a building and to handle the Classical motifs with such precision and economy that the large, reticent wall-surfaces against which they are seen are rendered doubly significant and effective" [...] (Eriksen 1974:66).|$|E
2500|$|From the {{embryonic}} stages itself, a {{layer of}} columnar or <b>cuboidal</b> epithelial cells {{gives rise to the}} external cuticle and an internal basement membrane. The majority of insect material is held in the endocuticle. The cuticle provides muscular support and acts as a protective shield as the insect develops. However, since it cannot grow, the external sclerotised part of the cuticle is periodically shed in a process called [...] "moulting". As the time for moulting approaches, most of the exocuticle material is reabsorbed. In moulting, first the old cuticle separates from the epidermis (apolysis). Enzymatic moulting fluid is released between the old cuticle and epidermis, which separates the exocuticle by digesting the endocuticle and sequestering its material for the new cuticle. When the new cuticle has formed sufficiently, the epicuticle and reduced exocuticle are shed in ecdysis.|$|E
2500|$|Corneal endothelium: {{a simple}} {{squamous}} or low <b>cuboidal</b> monolayer, approx 5 μm thick, of mitochondria-rich cells. These cells {{are responsible for}} regulating fluid and solute transport between the aqueous and corneal stromal compartments. (The term endothelium is a misnomer here. [...] The corneal endothelium is bathed by aqueous humor, not by blood or lymph, and has a very different origin, function, and appearance from vascular endothelia.) [...] Unlike the corneal epithelium, {{the cells of the}} endothelium do not regenerate. [...] Instead, they stretch to compensate for dead cells which reduces the overall cell density of the endothelium, which affects fluid regulation. [...] If the endothelium can no longer maintain a proper fluid balance, stromal swelling due to excess fluids and subsequent loss of transparency will occur and this may cause corneal edema and interference with the transparency of the cornea and thus impairing the image formed. Iris pigment cells deposited on the corneal endothelium can sometimes be washed into a distinct vertical pattern by the aqueous currents - this is known as Krukenberg's Spindle.|$|E
2500|$|The bell {{stage is}} known for the histodifferentiation and morphodifferentiation that takes place. The dental organ is {{bell-shaped}} during this stage, {{and the majority of}} its cells are called stellate reticulum because of their star-shaped appearance. [...] The bell stage is divided into the early bell stage and the late bell stage. [...] Cells {{on the periphery of the}} enamel organ separate into four important layers. <b>Cuboidal</b> cells on the periphery of the dental organ are known as outer enamel epithelium (OEE). The columnar cells of the enamel organ adjacent to the enamel papilla are known as inner enamel epithelium (IEE). The cells between the IEE and the stellate reticulum form a layer known as the stratum intermedium. [...] The rim of the enamel organ where the outer and inner enamel epithelium join is called the cervical loop. In summary, the layers in order of innermost to outermost consist of dentin, enamel (formed by IEE, or 'ameloblasts', as they move outwards/upwards), inner enamel epithelium and stratum intermedium (stratified cells that support the synthetic activity of the inner enamel epithelium) [...] What follows is part of the initial 'enamel organ', the center of which is made up of stellate reticulum cells that serve to protect the enamel organ. [...] This is all encased by the OEE layer.|$|E
6000|$|... {{experiment}} {{had been}} tried, Guide Manoel {{pointed out the}} place where stood the tormentos, as he called the instruments. Thence we toiled afoot up the Mal Pais. This 'bad country' is contradictorily described by travellers. Glas (A.D. 1761) makes it a sheet of rock cracked cross-wise into cubes. Humboldt (1799) says, 'The lava, broken into sharp pieces, leaves hollows in which we risked falling up to our waists.' Von Buch (1815) mentions 'the sharp edges of glassy obsidian, as dangerous as the blades of knives.' Wilde (1857) tamely paints the scene as a 'magnified rough-cast.' Prof. Piazzi Smyth is, as usual, exact, but he suggests more difficulty than the traveller finds. I saw nothing beyond a succession of ridge-backs and shrinkage-crevasses, disposed upon an acute angle. These ragged, angular, and mostly <b>cuboidal</b> blocks, resembling the ice-pack of St. Lawrence River, have apparently been borne down by subsequent lava-currents, which, however, lacked impetus to reach {{the lower levels of}} Las Cañádas.|$|E
