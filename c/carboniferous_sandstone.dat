50|$|A {{section of}} Bude's coast {{which is located}} between Compass Cove {{to the south and}} Furzey Cove to the north, is a SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest) noted for its {{geological}} and biological interest. <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>sandstone</b> cliffs surround Bude. During the Variscan Orogeny the strata were heavily faulted and folded. As the sands and cliffs around Bude contain calcium carbonate (a natural fertiliser), farmers used to take sand from the beach, for spreading on their fields. The cliffs around Bude are the only ones in Cornwall that are made of <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>sandstone,</b> as most of the Cornish coast is formed of Devonian slate, granite and Precambrian metamorphic rocks. The stratified cliffs of Bude give their name to a sequence of rocks called the Bude Formation. Many formations can be viewed from the South West Coast Path which passes through the town.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of Allestree Park is underlain {{by a series}} of <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>sandstone</b> and shale beds, as well as glacial drift. The large area of deciduous woodland, known as Big Wood, is underlain by Sherwood sandstones. In places these have been quarried for sand and have been formally designated as Regionally Important Geological Sites.|$|E
50|$|West Lomond is {{the highest}} point in the county of Fife, Scotland and the highest peak in the Lomond Hills. Its {{volcanic}} dolerite cone rises above an escarpment of <b>carboniferous</b> <b>sandstone</b> and limestone layers. The conspicuous peaks of West Lomond, and its neighbour East Lomond, are visible for many miles around, which explains their name, the 'Lomond' or 'Beacon' hills.|$|E

25|$|The {{underlying}} geology of {{the city}} is primarily <b>carboniferous</b> <b>sandstones.</b> These vary in quality from rough rock to fine, honey-coloured stone of building quality. Access to this material has had a pronounced effect on the architecture {{of the city}}. The city also lies within the north western parts of the Yorkshire Coalfield which is mostly composed of carboniferous coal measures.|$|R
50|$|One {{example from}} Great Britain is {{the mass of}} Triassic {{sandstone}} around the Staffordshire town of Leek. This is isolated from the very much larger area of Triassic rocks which characterise the English Midlands and Cheshire Basin, {{to the south and}} west respectively, by the surrounding <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>sandstones</b> and mudstones. Similarly in the Black Mountains of South Wales, the summit area of Pen Cerrig-calch is composed from a suite of <b>Carboniferous</b> age <b>sandstones</b> and limestone. This outcrop is isolated from the main extent of these rocks (which form the South Wales Coalfield and its margins some miles to the south) by the Devonian Old Red Sandstone on which it rests by and by which it is surrounded.|$|R

5000|$|A spoil tip (also {{called a}} spoil bank, boney pile, gob pile, bing, batch, boney dump or pit heap) is a pile built of {{accumulated}} spoil - the overburden or other waste rock removed during coal and ore mining. These waste materials are typically composed of shale, {{as well as}} smaller quantities of <b>carboniferous</b> <b>sandstone</b> and various other residues. Spoil tips are not formed of slag, but in some areas they {{are referred to as}} slag heaps.|$|E
50|$|Widemouth Bay is {{visually}} {{very similar}} to Southerndown and Ogmore-by-Sea across the Bristol Channel in Wales; {{it has the same}} (gently sloping) hill-top location; wide, sandy beach; pounding Atlantic surf; and significantly the same <b>carboniferous</b> <b>sandstone</b> cliffs. Another significant connection is that sloops from Wales would use Widemouth as a port (in the most basic sense), unloading coal and limestone; sloops would take back to Wales Cornish wares such as granite, slate, tin, copper and even Cornish pasties.|$|E
50|$|The massif {{contains}} volcanic features {{including the}} extinct caldera of Arakao, Cenozoic lava flows of hawaiite to trachyte composition, volcanic cones, tuff rings {{and one of}} the largest ring dike systems in the world. At Izouzaoenehe, lie the marble Blue Mountains, and the lower Zagado valley is surrounded by white marble hills. <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>sandstone</b> and coal units in the Iullemmeden Basin just {{to the west of the}} massif contain uranium mineralisation sourced from the granites of the massif.|$|E

5|$|Greater Manchester {{is mainly}} urban, {{and is one}} of the most densely {{populated}} regions in Europe. In the second half of the 18thcentury, the Industrial Revolution played an important role in the growth and development of Manchester and its surrounding area, and industry continues to be a major part of the region's economy. There are few buildings surviving from before the Industrial Revolution, but many from the 19th and 20thcenturies. The bedrock consists mainly of <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>sandstones,</b> including millstone grit, which is a major source of building material for the region's churches. The superficial deposits are of boulder clay, which provides material for making bricks.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} {{of oil and gas}} are important to Algeria’s economy, being Africa’s main producer of the latter. Its reserves were estimated at 4.502 trillion m3 at the end of 2008. Productive fields are found in anticlines, faulted anticlines or domes; the reservoirs being in Cambro-Ordovician, Triassic, Devonian, and <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>sandstones.</b> Caprocks include Triassic evaporites and Carboniferous to Devonian shales. The major source rocks for the hydrocarbons were Silurian shales rich in organic material. In 2008, Algeria was the fourth largest oil producer in Africa accounting for about one sixth of the continent’s production. The country’s proven reserves of crude petroleum are out at 1.66 billion tonnes, or about 1 percent of the global reserve.|$|R
50|$|North Cornwall has {{a stretch}} of {{coastline}} that borders the Celtic Sea to the north. The <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>sandstone</b> cliffs that surround Bude (and stretch down {{as far south as}} Crackington Haven) were formed during the Carboniferous period, around 300 million years ago. They are part of what are known to geologists as the Culm Measures which continue eastwards across north Devon. The folded and contorted stratification of shale and sandstone is unique in southern England. During the Variscan Orogeny, which affected the entire Cornish coast, the cliffs were pushed up from underneath the sea, creating the overlapping strata. As the sands and cliffs around Bude contain calcium carbonate (a natural fertiliser), farmers used to take sand from the beach, for spreading on their fields. The cliffs around Bude are the only ones in Cornwall that are made of <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>sandstone,</b> as most of the Cornish coast is geologically formed of Devonian slate, granite and Precambrian metamorphic rocks). The stratified cliffs of Bude gave their name to a geological event called the Bude Formation. Many formations can be viewed from the South West Coast Path which passes through the town.|$|E

50|$|Little London {{occupies}} a spur of high {{ground in a}} dramatic position above the Aire valley. Cragg Wood is sloping down to the south, the Esholt estate is located to the west. To the northeast the land rises gradually towards Billing Hill and the moors above Yeadon. The underlying rocks consist mostly of <b>carboniferous</b> <b>sandstone</b> with Millstone Grit sandstone to the north. The sandstone was exploited {{in at least two}} quarries within or very near to today's Conservation Area and was used as a building material.|$|E

50|$|Many of the Ordovician and Silurian age {{sandstones}} and mudstones were faulted and tightly folded {{during the}} Caledonian Orogeny. The overlying Devonian and <b>Carboniferous</b> age <b>sandstones</b> (e.g. Twrch Sandstone), mudstones and limestones {{have generally been}} tilted gently {{to the south and}} southwest towards the main South Wales Coalfield basin.|$|R
5000|$|Lower <b>Carboniferous</b> Drybrook <b>Sandstone</b> lies {{under the}} {{conglomerates}} {{and there is}} a significant collection of late Dinantian fossil plants visible (ten different species). One of the oldest known mosses is present (Muscites plumatus). Some species are common with the contemporary Lower Brown Limestone and Lower Oil Shales floras.|$|R
50|$|The geology of Aachen is very {{structurally}} heterogeneous. The oldest occurring {{rocks in}} the area surrounding the city originate from the Devonian period and include <b>carboniferous</b> <b>sandstone,</b> graywacke, claystone and limestone. These formations {{are part of the}} Rhenish Massif, north of the High Fens. In the Pennsylvanian subperiod of the Carboniferous geological period, these rock layers were narrowed and folded {{as a result of the}} Variscan orogeny. After this event, and over the course of the following 200 million years, this area has been continuously flattened.|$|E
50|$|Lud's Church {{is formed}} within the thick bed of coarse <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>sandstone</b> {{known as the}} Roaches Grit which here dips northeastwards into the Goyt Syncline. The rocks of this area are traversed by {{numerous}} roughly northwest-to-southeast-oriented faults and fracture planes. In addition, weak layers of mudstone exist within the sequence. It is along such lines of weakness that a large mass of the Roaches Grit bounding the northeast side of the rift has slipped slightly downhill into the Dane Valley resulting in the open rift. The age of the movement is unknown but {{is likely to be}} post-glacial.|$|E
50|$|Natural gas was {{discovered}} in Ryedale in 1970. The gas for the power station {{does not come from}} the National Transmission System but local gas fields found in Permian limestone and <b>carboniferous</b> <b>sandstone</b> at 5,000-foot depth. The Permian reservoir gas contains small quantities of hydrogen sulphide (less than 0.1% by weight). At the Knapton site the combined gas flow from the well sites passes to a separator where liquids are removed. It then passes to a sulphur removal facility before being sent to the gas turbine. The removed liquids are sent to a liquids injection well which returns them to the underground reservoir. The Knapton site also has a ground flare to burn waste gases.|$|E
5000|$|The Leinster Coalfield is {{hosted by}} an outlier (younger rocks {{surrounded}} by stratigraphically underlying older rocks) of Upper <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>sandstones,</b> siltstones and shales that {{sit on the}} surrounding Lower Carboniferous limestones. These rock types formed over 300 Million years ago and form the bedrock of Castlecomer and surrounding areas. The area's geological history has facilitated a successful coal-mining and brick production industry. [...] "Footprints in Coal" [...] is a permanent interactive multimedia exhibition in the town which tells the complete story of the Castlecomer Coal deposits from {{the formation of the}} coal in the enormous swamp forests of the Carboniferous Period to the mines which operated until 1969. The exhibition uses fossils, mining artefacts, models, audio-visual and life-sized reconstructions of Carboniferous plants and animals to illustrate the story.|$|R
50|$|Built on the {{boundary}} of the Lower Carboniferous limestone and the Upper <b>Carboniferous</b> shale, <b>sandstone</b> and gritstone, the early settlement (of which only the parish church of St Anne, built in 1625, remains) was largely of limestone construction. The present buildings, of locally quarried sandstone, mostly date from the late 18th century.|$|R
40|$|The post–Variscan vein {{mineralisation}} is disseminated at {{the eastern}} border of the Bohemian Massif mainly in the Nízký Jeseník Upland and Upper Silesian Basin. Hydrothermal veins are hosted by Lower Carboniferous greywackes, siltstones, shales and conglomerates and Upper <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>sandstones.</b> In the larger area, the results of hydrothermal activity of post-Variscan age also comprise the large Mississippi Valley-type de-posits in Poland (Silesia-Cracow Zn-Pb district). Study of the region indicate a fluid flow through the Paleo-zoic rocks likely in a NW-SE direction, which could correlate {{with the concept of}} a major control exerted by the fault systems in the area. Evidence comes from a study of stable isotopes and fluid inclusions.

50|$|Sedimentary strata {{from the}} Palaeozoic are mainly <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>sandstone,</b> metasandstone, shale and phyllite, and lesser Ordovician, Silurian and Permian {{limestone}}.Precambrian strata are rarely exposed.Rocks from the Triassic include inter-bedded limestone and basaltic volcanic units, most common along the terrane's southern margin.In the northern terrane the Jurassic strata are deepwater sandstone and shale, often with ophiolitic assemblages.In the southern terrane the Jurassic strata are marine limestone and mudstone.Strata from the Lower Cretaceous are clastic mudstone, sandstone and local conglomerate units.The Lower Cretaceous clastic units are overlaid by a shallow marine limestone from the Aptian-Albian period, exposed in many places, {{which in some}} places holds Cenomanian fossils.The strata from the Upper Cretaceous are successions of arkosic fluvial sandstone and mudstone.|$|E
50|$|Araguainha is {{a complex}} crater with annular and radial faults, exposed {{to the surface and}} eroded, crossed by the Araguaia River. The crater has an uplifted central core, shaped like an {{elliptical}} basin, consisting of exposed basement granite. Surrounding this core is a ring of shocked granite and overlying breccias; then another ring of ridges and mountains, 6.5 km in diameter and up to 150 m high, consisting of folded and steeply tilted Devonian sandstones. This central region is surrounded by an annular depression floored by rocks from Devonian and <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>sandstone</b> formations. The outer rim of the crater consists of remnants of semi-circular grabens in highly deformed Permo-Carboniferous sediments. Evidences of impact origin include shatter cones, impact breccias, and shocked quartz.|$|E
50|$|High Force {{was formed}} where the River Tees crosses the Whin Sill - a hard layer of igneous rock (also seen at Hadrian's Wall and other locations). The {{waterfall}} itself {{consists of three}} different types of rock. The upper band {{is made up of}} whinstone, or dolerite, a hard igneous rock which the waterfall {{takes a lot of time}} to erode. The lower section is made up of Carboniferous Limestone, a softer rock which is more easily worn away by the waterfall. Between these two layers is a thinner layer of <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>sandstone,</b> which was baked hard when the Whin Sill was molten 295 million years ago. The wearing away of rock means that the waterfall is slowly moving upstream, leaving a narrow, deep gorge in front of it. The length of the gorge is currently about 700 metres. The bedload (rocks that the river is carrying) is mainly composed of large boulders, which are rolled along the river bed. Upstream of the waterfall, the river is narrow; downstream, it widens and meanders.|$|E
