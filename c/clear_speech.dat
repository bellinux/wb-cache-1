With magnetic tape, the tape must be reversed and spliced back into the cassette. Compact discs were difficult to reverse when first introduced, but digital audio editors, which were first introduced in the late 1980s and became popular during the next decade, allow easy reversal of audio from digital sources.|$|E
2500|$|With {{financial}} support from Sanders and Hubbard, Bell hired Thomas Watson as his assistant, {{and the two of}} them experimented with acoustic telegraphy. On June 2, 1875, Watson accidentally plucked one of the reeds and Bell, at the receiving end of the wire, heard the overtones of the reed; overtones that would be necessary for transmitting speech. That demonstrated to Bell that only one reed or armature was necessary, not multiple reeds. This led to the [...] "gallows" [...] sound-powered telephone, which could transmit indistinct, voice-like sounds, but not <b>clear</b> <b>speech.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{mouthpiece}} is a {{part that}} the user grips in the mouth to make a watertight seal. It is a short flattened-oval tube that goes in between the lips, with a curved flange that fits between the lips and the teeth and gums. On the inner ends of the flange there are two tabs with enlarged ends, which are gripped between the teeth. Most recreational diving regulators are fitted with a mouthpiece. In twin-hose regulators and rebreathers, [...] "mouthpiece" [...] may refer to the whole assembly between the two flexible tubes.

The most common device is a handheld, battery-operated device placed under the mandible which produces vibrations to allow speech. [...] Earlier non-electric devices were called mechanical larynxes.

Bell tested Gray's liquid transmitter design in this experiment, but only after Bell's patent was granted and only as a proof of concept scientific experiment to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible [...] "articulate speech" [...] (Bell's words) could be electrically transmitted. Because a liquid transmitter was not practical for commercial products, Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone after March 1876 and never used Gray's liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use.|$|E

6000|$|The {{voice of}} Theosophy has been heard {{in favor of}} downing the gallows. As usual the voice is a trifle vague and it babbles. <b>Clear</b> <b>speech</b> is the outcome of clear thought, and that is {{something}} to which Theosophists are not addicted. Considering their infirmity in that way, it would be hardly fair to take them as seriously as they take themselves, but when any considerable number of apparently earnest citizens unite in a petition to the Governor of their State, to commute the death sentence of a convicted assassin without alleging a doubt of his guilt the phenomenon challenges a certain attention to what they do allege. What these amiable persons hold, it seems, is what was held by Alphonse Karr: the expediency of abolishing the death penalty; but apparently they do not hold, with him, that the assassins should begin. They want the State to begin, believing that the magnanimous example will effect a change of heart in those about to murder. This, I take it, is the meaning of their assertion that [...] "death penalties have not the deterring influence which imprisonment for life carries." [...] In this they obviously err: death deters at least the person who suffers it--he commits no more murder; whereas the assassin who is imprisoned for life and immune from further punishment may with impunity kill his keeper or whomsoever he {{may be able to get}} at. Even as matters now are, the most incessant vigilance is required to prevent convicts in prison from murdering their attendants and one another. How would it be if the [...] "life-termer" [...] were assured against any additional inconvenience for braining a guard occasionally, or strangling a chaplain now and then? A penitentiary may be described as a place of punishment and reward; and under the system proposed the difference in desirableness between a sentence and an appointment would be virtually effaced. To overcome this objection a life sentence would have to mean solitary confinement, and that means insanity. Is that what these Theosophical gentlemen propose to substitute for death? ...|$|E

Six German speaking mothers sang for their children aged between 2 and 10 months. Stressed long vowels /a/, /i/, /u / of these songs were analyzed and compared to vowels in samples of AD speech. Results show that mothers use acoustically more extreme vowels when singing for their infants than in AD speech. This indicates that singing forms a subpart of the infant-directed register which is well-adapted to assist the child at an early stage in discovering and acquiring the linguistically relevant characteristics of his/her mother tongue...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{development}} of a system for the automatic, objective and reliable detection of cough events is a need underlined by the medical literature for years. The benefit of such a tool is clear as it would allow the assessment of pathology severity in chronic cough diseases. Even though some approaches have recently reported solutions achieving this task with a relative success, {{there is still no}} standardization about the method to adopt or the sensors to use. The goal {{of this paper is to}} study objectively the performance of several sensors for cough detection: ECG, thermistor, chest belt, accelerometer, contact and audio microphones. Experiments are carried out on a database of 32 healthy subjects producing, in a confined room and in three situations, voluntary cough at various volumes as well as other event categories which can possibly lead to some detection errors: background noise, forced expiration, throat <b>clearing,</b> <b>speech</b> and laugh. The relevance of each sensor is evaluated at three stages: mutual information conveyed by the features, ability to discriminate at the frame level cough from these latter other sources of ambiguity, and ability to detect cough events. In this latter experiment, with both an averaged sensitivity and specificity of about 94. 5 %, the proposed approach is shown to clearly outperform the commercial Karmelsonix system which achieved a specificity of 95. 3 % and a sensitivity of 64. 9 %...|$|R
