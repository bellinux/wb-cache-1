50|$|SHC was {{interested}} in applying the system to a railway locomotive and contacted Richard Maunsell of the Southern Railway. Maunsell requested that a controlled test be carried out at Surbiton and this was done about 1929. Maunsell's technical assistant, Harold Holcroft, was present and a fuel saving of 29% was recorded, compared to conventional atmospheric working. The Southern Railway converted SECR N class locomotive number A816 (later 1816 and 31816) to the Anderson system in 1930. The locomotive underwent trials and initial results were encouraging. After an uphill trial from Eastleigh to Litchfield Summit, Holcroft is reported as saying:"In the ordinary way this would have created much noise and clouds of steam, but with the <b>condensing</b> <b>set</b> in action it was all absorbed with {{the ease with which}} snow would melt in a furnace! The engine was as silent as an electric locomotive and the only faint noises were due to slight pounding of the rods and a small blow at a piston gland. This had to be experienced to be believed; but for the regulator being wide open and the reverser well over, one would have imagined that the second engine (an LSWR T14 class that had been provided as a back-up) was propelling the first". The trials continued until 1934 but various problems arose and the project went no further. The locomotive was converted back to standard form in 1935.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Data {{reduction}} techniques {{improve the}} efficiency of k-Nearest Neigh-bour classification on large datasets since they accelerate the classification process and reduce storage requirements for the training data. IB 2 is an effective prototype selection data reduction technique. It selects some items from the initial training dataset and uses them as representatives (prototypes). Contrary to many other tech-niques, IB 2 is a very fast, one-pass method that builds its reduced (<b>condensing)</b> <b>set</b> in an incremental manner. New training data can update the <b>condensing</b> <b>set</b> without the need of the “old ” removed items. This paper proposes a variation of IB 2, that generates new prototypes instead of selecting them. The variation is called AIB 2 and attempts to improve {{the efficiency of}} IB 2 by positioning the prototypes {{in the center of}} the data areas they represent. The empirical experimental study conducted in the present work as well as the Wilcoxon signed ranks test show that AIB 2 per-forms better than IB 2...|$|E

We then introduce a series of effective pruning strategies, and develop a method, nDaCF-Miner, for discovering nDaCF sets. Experimental results show that, when the error bound is somewhat high, the discovered nDaCF sets are two orders of magnitude smaller than complete sets, and nDaCF-miner is more efficient than previous mining approaches. In addition, the nDaCF sets are more accurate than the sets found by previous approaches. <br /...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} series of data-reduction methods for {{classifying}} an unknown object as one member of a large set of possible patterns. The first reduction method is a learning algorithm that reduces a gigantic set of training samples into a <b>condensed</b> <b>set</b> of templates, each represented in vector form. When used in a testing process, these templates hold target patterns within the nearest K templates for almost all unknown objects, where K is a small number. The second reduction method exploits the nature of templates and classification trees to form a fast tree-retrieval mechanism. Experiment results show that this retrieval mechanism {{is a lot more}} effective than the K-means clustering method in meeting the same objective. The third method is a disambiguation method that supplies a <b>condensed</b> <b>set</b> of confusing pairs.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} {{embedded in}} an online data stream is likely to change over time due to the dynamic evolution of the stream. Consequently, infrequent episode mining over an online stream, frequent episodes should be adaptively extracted from recently generated stream segments instead of the whole stream. However, almost all existing frequent episode mining approaches find episodes frequently occurring over the whole sequence. This paper proposes and investigates a new problem: online mining of recently frequent episodes over data streams. In order to meet strict requirements of stream mining such as one-scan, adaptive result update and instant result return, we choose a novel frequency metric and define a highly <b>condensed</b> <b>set</b> called the base of recently frequent episodes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for fast rigid docking of proteins based on geometric complementarity. After extraction of the 3 D molecular surface, a set of local surface patches is generated based on the local surface curvature. The shape complementarity between a pair of patches is calculated using an efficient shape descriptor, the Shape Impact Descriptor. The key property of the Shape Impact Descriptor is its rotation invariance, which obviates the need for taking an exhaustive set of rotations for each pair of patches. Thus, complementarity matching between two patches is reduced to a simple histogram matching. Finally, a <b>condensed</b> <b>set</b> of almost complementary pairs of surface patches is supplied as input to the final scoring step, where each pose is evaluated using a 3 D distance grid.

Consistency of the discrete model with the classical, smooth equations is established formally in the limit of a vanishing discretization length. The discrete models lends itself naturally to numerical implementation. Our numerical method is validated against reference solutions for steady coiling.
