5000|$|In 1974, {{the airline}} took {{delivery}} {{of its first}} Boeing 747. The Flying Tiger Line then put in orders for brand new Boeing 747-200F freighters designated the Boeing 747-249F, {{which at the time}} were among the heaviest commercial airplanes flying, weighing in at 823000 lb. These aircraft had the powerful [...] "Q" [...] (Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7Q) engines and heavy landing gear and could simultaneously carry both 250000 lb of fuel and 250000 lb of cargo loaded through both the nose door and the side door at the same time. Aircraft loaders had earlier refused to work at the extreme 30 ft height necessary for loading freight on the upper deck, so the [...] "supernumerary area" [...] or [...] "hump" [...] was configured with 19 first class seats instead which were used to transport livestock handlers, <b>charter</b> <b>agents</b> and mechanics as well as dead-heading pilots and flight attendants.|$|R

50|$|The {{helicopter}} is a Bell 429 and is {{the first}} of its type to operate as an air ambulance in the UK. It {{is one of the most}} advanced light twin helicopters ever developed, offering exceptional flight performance, low operating cost and proven reliability. WAACT leases the Bell 429 from Heli <b>Charter,</b> Bell's UK <b>agent,</b> with whom it has a 10-year contract. It has a top speed of 180 mph (156 knots) and a maximum cruising speed of 173 mph (150 knots). It can reach anywhere in the county within 11 minutes.|$|R
5000|$|In {{yachting}} a {{bareboat charter}} is usually {{for a short}} period. There are hundreds of bareboat yacht <b>charter</b> brokers or <b>agent</b> companies. These companies offer yacht finding and travel organisation services similar to travel agent only more specialized. Their purpose is to use their experience and networks to locate a client's ideal bareboat in terms of price and location. Much like online travel agencies that sell unsold inventory of airline tickets and hotel rooms {{at a fraction of}} the price, there are now also last minute bareboat charter brokers where travellers can find excellent rates.|$|R
50|$|While colonial {{agencies}} {{existed in}} the seventeenth century, they were temporary and mostly concerned with affairs of great importance, when affairs in the colony seemed {{to call for a}} greater level of communication with the British government. An agent was needed in Massachusetts particularly for the purpose of protecting the <b>charter.</b> Often, these <b>agents</b> were prominent persons from the colonies that were sent to England to be representatives at court. Once their mission was accomplished, however, their agencies came to an end. As colonial management developed in the 18th century, agencies became a permanent representation, rather than a temporary special embassy.|$|R
50|$|The D.A.M. Society staff {{consisted}} of six {{men who were}} elected {{in the first instance}} by the joint vote of the State Legislative Assembly. These men of foresight and vision gave their loyal service without any compensation other than the joy of public service. Despite its <b>charter</b> as an <b>agent</b> of the territorial government, the Society's motive force and institutional goals and staffs were provided by the LDS Church and for many years the president of the Society, and the members of its board of directors, were selected or approved by Brigham Young. The first President of the Society was The Presiding Bishop of the LDS Church, Edward Hunter who served from 1856 until 1863.|$|R

Ian Cross left school and followed his older brother Kenneth into the Royal Air Force to train as a pilot.|$|R
40|$|This {{report has}} {{examined}} the concept of value creation in the maritime chain of transportation. A maritime transport chain can best be conceptualized as a network through which carriers (e. g. shipping companies and haulage providers) and third parties (e. g. terminal operators, freight forwarders, brokers and agents) provide services for the movement of cargo provided by shippers. The main actors in the maritime chain of transportation are the carriers who add value to the shipper by moving goods from areas with excess supply to areas with excess demand. In this process a number of (independent) third parties may provide a number of services. The shipper and/or carrier will employ these agents if the rise in costs is more than compensated by {{the value of the}} service. The third parties can thus only exist if they provide value added services to the carrier and/or to other third party service providers. From a financial perspective value is created when a business earns revenue that exceeds the expenses. In many sectors, however, value is increasingly being created by more intangible drivers such as research, innovation, branding, ideas and networks which usually provide indirect rather than direct benefits (Kaplan & Norton, 2004 a; 2004 b). This is also the case within maritime logistics. According to Johansson et al. (1993) third parties may add value through (1) improve the level of service, (2) quality, (3) cost and (4) time reduction. The <b>chartering</b> <b>agent’s</b> network and market knowledge allows him to speed up the search time and match process for shippers and carriers (time reduction). The port agent’s local network allows him to speed up port operations (time reduction) and make the necessary arrangement on behalf of the carrier (service). Freight forwarders may take over part of the production chain and provide services which manufacturers don’t consider their core business (service). This includes assembly, quality control, customizing and packing of goods, pest control and after sales services. Third party ship management companies may reduce costs through economies of scale (cost reduction) and increase quality of crew and equipment maintenance through specialization (quality). Just to mention a few. While the report has investigated the concept of value creation, the question of value capturing has not been addressed in this study. Value capturing depends on the individual transactions between the actors in the chain. A port agent may add value to a carrier by securing smooth port operations and thus reduce waiting time. The added value may, however, be captured by a freight forwarder who forces the carrier to lower the price or more likely be distributed among several actors. The business model literature may provide a fruitful lens for exploring this in greater depth. The maritime chain of transportation is becoming increasingly complex and involves an increasing number of actors. The services of some actors are furthermore overlapping. Inland haulage can thus be provided by shippers, freight forwarders, independent liner agents, in-house liner sales offices, or by an independent haulage provider. Freight forwarders are increasingly overtaking functions in the value chain from manufacturer etc. In order to successfully navigate this network is it important to have an overview of the chain of transportation at a more general level...|$|R
50|$|The {{wealth of}} the Charters Towers goldfields grew in the {{following}} years, particularly following the 1886 Colonial and Indian Exhibition in London where specimens of Charters Towers Gold were featured. Almost immediately English investors {{seized the opportunity to}} be part of the Charters Towers gold riches. Mining companies were formed, managed by <b>Charters</b> Towers' mining <b>agents</b> and share-brokers, and while some shares were held by English interests, many local people prospered through their investments, which then led to an expansion of banking facilities and mining exchanges. Banks and gold buyers purchased the gold, minted it into sovereigns in Australia and England, which were held in the vaults of banks in Melbourne, London, Berlin, and New York and then shipped to pay international debt. According to the Northern Miner newspaper, there were five banks in Gill Street in mid 1887: the Bank of NSW, Bank of Australasia, London Chartered Bank, Union and Royal Banks. The Queensland National Bank and the Australian Joint Stock Bank remained in Mosman Street.|$|R
500|$|Soon after {{returning}} to England, Phips joined back up with Increase Mather and again supported him in dealing with Whitehall. Increase Mather's diary says they are together on March 25, 1691, and again on March 26. On March 31, they are together as Increase Mather writes {{a response to the}} Board of Trade. Also at this meeting is Sir Henry Ashurst. These three—Mather the clergyman, flanked by two knights: Sir Phips & Sir Ashurst—would emerge later as the major proponents of the various compromises that brought about a new charter. Not counting Phips, there seem to have been a total of four agents acting on behalf of Massachusetts in seeking to restore the old <b>charter.</b> The two <b>agents</b> holding official commission papers from the Massachusetts council—Cooke and Oakes—were also the least compromising and the least politically deft. The Board of Trade seems to have sought a policy of pushing through a new charter by cleaving the two knights away from these two agents. July 24, Increase Mather records in his diary that he would [...] "part with my life sooner than [...] ". Not long after this Increase Mather left London on vacation. August 11, 1691, a letter was written from Whitehall to the King William's secretary: [...] "I must now desire your Lordship to acquaint the King {{that they are willing to}} accept their Charter... and no longer Insist upon the Alterations mentioned..." [...] This could not have been Cooke and Oakes, as they never wavered in their stance opposing a new charter. Mather's diary entry one week later (August 19) indicates that he is still either unaware or has not yet accepted this move. On August 20, the Earl of Nottingham told a committee that he had been with Sir William Phips who informed him that the New England agents [...] "did acquiesce therein [...]" [...] By August 27, Increase Mather had decided to participate in the process of shaping this new charter, if reluctantly.|$|R
40|$|Transformation of {{the mining}} sector is {{imperative}} in South Africa {{as it is}} the backbone of the economy and informs all aspects of competitiveness in the global arena. In addition, it attracts foreign investment. The Mining <b>Charter</b> is an <b>agent</b> of transformation in the mining sector and its continuous updating must be the focus of all stakeholders given the lifespan of the Mining Charter. Thinking about tomorrow and planning ahead to a sustainable future is of importance to South Africa and is, therefore, vital for the implementation of strategies to take the sector forward. Such forward planning will ensure the efficient transformation and sustainable growth of the sector to address the inequalities in the distribution of income, property and opportunities as well as the very high levels of crime and violence that exists in the country. This disparity s {{is the result of the}} historically disadvantaged population groups of which the black South Africans comprise the majority. Continuous measures have to be taken to redress these disparities in order to achieve social and economic emancipation for all citizens. The Mining Charter has a lifespan of 10 years, commencing in 2004 and ending in 2014. The research investigates the various elements of the Charter and whether the industry will have effectively been transformed at the end of its lifespan. The question that is raised is what should happen beyond 2014. Recommendations are made to promote practices in the mining industry that should lead to the desired results. The research has included literature on transformation in South Africa, in particular the mining sector charter evaluation. The author’s personal experience and involvement in the mining industry in implementing the Charter, drafting Social and Labour Plans, Employment Equity Plans and consultations with various stakeholders and the synthesis of various data has also been considered. A comparative analysis of countries that have undergone a transformation agenda has been made. Even though progress has been made, the strategies beyond 2014 are a realization that in the transformation of the mining industry, there is still a need to re-visit the fundamentals in an attempt to achieve transformation in terms of substantive behaviors and practices. The research advocates strategies and implementation plans for the transformation of the Mining Sector of South Africa and recommends a proposed new charter in two parts: one for industry and the other for government...|$|R
