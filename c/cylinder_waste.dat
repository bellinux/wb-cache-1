50|$|The Ford EDIS or Electronic Distributorless Ignition System is a {{computer-controlled}} {{ignition system}} developed by Ford that uses an ignition coil for {{each pair of}} <b>cylinders</b> (<b>wasted</b> spark). All the coils are placed in a single module called a coilpack.|$|R
50|$|In a piston-ported {{two-stroke}} engine however, {{the situation is}} more complicated due {{to the need to}} prevent unburned fuel/air mixture from passing right through the cylinders into the exhaust. During the exhaust phase of the cycle, backpressure is even more undesirable than in a four-stroke engine due to the shorter time available for exhaust and the lack of pumping action from the piston to force the exhaust out of the cylinder. However, since the exhaust port necessarily remains open for a time after scavenging is completed, unburned mixture can follow the exhaust out of the <b>cylinder,</b> <b>wasting</b> fuel and increasing pollution, and this can only be prevented if the pressure at the exhaust port is greater than that in the cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{demonstration}} is {{to direct}} the air flow from, e.g., a vacuum cleaner operating in reverse, tangentially past a round <b>cylinder.</b> A <b>waste</b> basket works well. The air flow seems to [...] "wrap around" [...] the cylinder and can be detected at more than 180° from the incoming flow. Under the right conditions, flow rate, weight of the cylinder, smoothness of the surface it sits on, the cylinder actually moves. Note that the cylinder does not move directly into the flow as a misapplication of the Bernoulli effect would predict, but at a diagonal.|$|R
40|$|The Fuel Conditioning Facility at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Engineering Laboratory, INEEL, is {{to produce}} a spent fuel waste product which is {{essentially}} a heat-generating ceramic cylinder with a very tight-fitting stainless steel clad. The size of this waste product, which is under development, is such {{that many of them}} will fit into one of the large cylindrical containers being considered for use at the Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada. A key concern is how to size the <b>waste</b> <b>cylinders</b> and arrange them inside the container so that the space within the container is efficiently used and ceramic temperatures above about 600 C are not reached. The <b>waste</b> <b>cylinders</b> are all the same size and are uniformly arranged in layers on a triangular pitch. A layer is formed by placing a number of <b>waste</b> <b>cylinders</b> together and orienting {{them as if they were}} cans sitting on a shelf. Here the shelf is a flat circular surface whose diameter is that of the inside of the container, 1. 481 m (58. 3 in). Many parallel shelves, or layers, of cylinders are placed one above the next inside the container. Three packaging concepts were considered for a layer: (1) the cylinders are separated only by open spaces, (2) a metallic, high thermal conductivity matrix is used which has holes (on a triangular pitch) in which the cylinders are centered, and (3) each cylinder is centered in a hexagonal-shaped tube and the tubes are placed side by side to form a large hexagon which fits inside the large container. All three concepts are thermally acceptable. For Concept 1 the temperatures are somewhat insensitive to the choice of fill gas, loose packing is preferable, and 3, 19, and 91 cylinders provide similar good results...|$|R
50|$|In September 1968 the M4 was {{replaced}} by an improved 602cc engine featuring higher compression pistons and forced induction from the engine fan giving slightly more power. As with the 2CV and Ami, cooling air was ducted straight to the heater, giving excellent demisting and heating. Mechanical contact-breakers were mounted {{at the front of}} the camshaft and located behind the cooling fan. The fan was mounted on a tapered shaft and secured with a bolt at the bottom of a deep tube (the top of which engaged the starter handle). As the location of the mounting points was not obvious to the uninformed, they were often neglected. The ignition coil fired both <b>cylinders</b> simultaneously (<b>wasting</b> one spark) and the spark plug wear was significantly greater than it should have been; 6000 miles was not uncommon for a spark plug.|$|R
50|$|A {{fundamental}} change in working principles was brought about by Scotsman James Watt. In close collaboration with Englishman Matthew Boulton, he had succeeded by 1778 in perfecting his steam engine, which incorporated a series of radical improvements, notably the closing off of {{the upper part of}} the cylinder, thereby making the low-pressure steam drive the top of the piston instead of the atmosphere, use of a steam jacket and the celebrated separate steam condenser chamber. The separate condenser did away with the cooling water that had been injected directly into the cylinder, which cooled the <b>cylinder</b> and <b>wasted</b> steam. Likewise, the steam jacket kept steam from condensing in the cylinder, also improving efficiency. These improvements increased engine efficiency so that Boulton & Watts engines used only 20-25% as much coal per horsepower-hour as Newcomen's. Boulton and Watt opened the Soho Foundry for the manufacture of such engines in 1795.|$|R
50|$|In 1763, Watt {{was asked}} to repair a model Newcomen engine {{belonging}} to the university. Even after repair, the engine barely worked. After much experimentation, Watt demonstrated that about three-quarters of the thermal energy of the steam was being consumed in heating the engine cylinder on every cycle. This energy was wasted because later in the cycle cold water was injected into the cylinder to condense the steam to reduce its pressure. Thus by repeatedly heating and cooling the <b>cylinder,</b> the engine <b>wasted</b> most of its thermal energy rather than converting it into mechanical energy.|$|R

5000|$|A 180° {{crankshaft}} engine suffers fewer {{pumping losses}} than a 360° twin, as displacement in the crankcase stays roughly constant. However, a 180° engine requires a separate ignition system, points or otherwise, for each cylinder. The 360° twins {{can have a}} single ignition system for both <b>cylinders,</b> with a <b>wasted</b> spark on each cylinder's exhaust stroke. The BMW F800 parallel twin motorcycle is a 360° design.

40|$|Until recently, several {{thousand}} kilograms of compressed gases were stored at the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR), in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, because these cylinders {{could not be}} taken off-site in their state of configuration for disposal. Restrictions on the storage of old compressed-gas <b>cylinders</b> compelled the <b>Waste</b> Management Organization of Lockheed Martin Energy Systems, Inc. (LMES) to dispose of these materials. Furthermore, a milestone in the ORR Site Treatment Plan required repackaging and shipment off-site of 21 cylinders by September 30, 1997. A pilot project, coordinated by the Chemical Technology Division (CTD) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), was undertaken to evaluate and recontainerize or neutralize these cylinders, which are mixed waste, to meet that milestone. Because the radiological component {{was considered to be}} confined to the exterior of the cylinder, the contents (once removed from the cylinder) could be handled as hazardous <b>waste,</b> and the <b>cylinder</b> could be handled as low-level waste (LLW). This pilot project to process 21 cylinders was important because of its potential impact. The successful completion of the project provides a newly demonstrated technology which can now be used to process the thousands of additional cylinders in inventory across the DOE complex. In this paper, many of the various aspects of implementing this project, including hurdles encountered and the lessons learned in overcoming them, are reported...|$|R

40|$|When large {{quantities}} of rocks containing sulphide minerals are excavated from mines, they react with water and oxygen to create sulphuric acid. When this water reaches {{a certain level of}} acidity it also starts leaching traces of metals, this wastewater is termed as Acid Mine Drainage (AMD), affects the surface and subsurface hydrology and extends its impact to the surrounding land. Although, several AMD treatment techniques and methods exist, lime treatment is the most common approach which proves to be highly expensive. In this study dimension stone (Kotastone) waste, generated by the stone quarrying/cutting industries was used for the detoxification of AMD. The selection criteria of treatment agent was its free of cost availability. pH increased from 2. 97 to 6. 21, net acidity dropped from 1196. 6 to 150 mg L - 1 of CaCO 3. Concentrations of metals like Fe 2 +, Cu 2 +, Zn 2 +, Ni 2 +, Co 2 + and Mn 2 + also reduced remarkably from 19. 69 to 99. 24 %. The experiments were carried out in 500 mL <b>cylinders</b> with different <b>waste</b> doses ranging from 0. 5 to 10 g. The cost comparison with hydrated lime and quick lime was also in favour of Kotastone waste for the AMD treatment Now, major efforts are required by the mining industry and the research laboratories to convert this prototype product into commercial ventures so that this waste can become a utility material instead of nuisance...|$|R
40|$|The current {{research}} studied the under-deposit corrosion resistance and the crevice corrosion resistance of alloy 22 in the wet/dry cyclic conditions. The alloy 22 specimens were tested under controlled drip condition. The whole test {{was divided into}} two parts. Test A was to simulate the corrosion of the pore water to the outer <b>cylinders</b> of the <b>waste</b> packages, and test B was to simulate the corrosion of the pore water in the crevice between the outer cylinders and the emplacement pallets. And the under-deposit local corrosion was observed on the deposit regions of the alloy 22 specimens after removing the deposit when MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O+Mg(NO 3) 2 · 6 H 2 O brines and 62 times concentrated unsaturated zone pore water (UZ 62 × solution) were used. The specimens occurred crevice corrosion by using simulated unsaturated zone (UZ) pore waters respectively, including 1243 times concentrated UZ pore water (UZ 1243 ×), 62 times concentrated UZ pore water (UZ 62 ×), and UZ pore water (UZ 1 ×). Crevice corrosion was observed on the specimens {{in all of the}} crevice tests, and under-deposit corrosion was also observed in such tests except the specimens using UZ 1 × solution tested and the bent specimen using UZ 1243 × solution.

40|$|Radioactive waste {{packages}} containing water and/or {{organic substances}} {{have the potential}} to radiolytically generate hydrogen and other combustible gases. Typically, the radiolytic gas generation rate is estimated from the energy deposition rate and the radiolytic gas yield. Estimation of the energy deposition rate must take into account the contributions from all radionuclides. While the contributions from non-gamma emitting radionuclides are relatively easy to estimate, an average geometry factor must be computed to determine the contribution from gamma emitters. Hitherto, no satisfactory method existed for estimating the geometry factors for a cylindrical package. In the present study, a formulation was developed taking into account the effect of photon buildup. A prototype code, called PC-CAGE, was developed to numerically solve the integrals involved. Based on the selected dimensions for a <b>cylinder,</b> the specified <b>waste</b> material, the photon energy of interest and a value for either the absorption or attenuation coefficient, the code outputs values for point and average geometry factors. These can then be used to estimate the internal dose rate to the material in the cylinder and hence to calculate the radiolytic gas generation rate. Besides the ability to estimate the rates of radiolytic gas generation, PC-CAGE can also estimate the dose received by the container material. This is based on values for the point geometry factors at the surface of the cylinder. PC-CAGE was used to calculate geometry factors for a number of cylindrical geometries. Estimates for the absorbed dose rate in container material were also obtained. The results for Ontario Power Generation's 3 m 3 resin containers indicate that about 80 % of the source gamma energy is deposited internally. In general, the fraction of gamma energy deposited internally depends on the dimensions of the cylinder, the material within it and the photon energy; the fraction deposited increases with increasing dimensions of the cylinder and decreases with increasing photon energy...|$|R
40|$|Stress {{corrosion}} cracking {{is one of}} the most common corrosion-related causes for premature breach of metal structural components. Stress {{corrosion cracking}} is the initiation and propagation of cracks in structural components due to three factors that must be present simultaneously: metallurgical susceptibility, critical environment, and static (or sustained) tensile stresses. This report was prepared according to ''Technical Work Plan for: Regulatory Integration Modeling and Analysis of the Waste Form and Waste Package'' (BSC 2004 [DIRS 171583]). The purpose of this report is to provide an evaluation of the potential for stress corrosion cracking of the engineered barrier system components (i. e., the drip shield, waste package outer barrier, and waste package stainless steel inner structural cylinder) under exposure conditions consistent with the repository during the regulatory period of 10, 000 years after permanent closure. For the drip shield and waste package outer barrier, the critical environment is conservatively taken as any aqueous environment contacting the metal surfaces. Appendix B of this report describes the development of the SCC-relevant seismic crack density model (SCDM). The consequence of a stress corrosion cracking breach of the drip shield, the waste package outer barrier, or the stainless steel inner structural cylinder material is the initiation and propagation of tight, sometimes branching, cracks that might be induced by the combination of an aggressive environment and various tensile stresses that can develop in the drip shields or the waste packages. The Stainless Steel Type 316 inner structural <b>cylinder</b> of the <b>waste</b> package is excluded from the stress corrosion cracking evaluation because the Total System Performance Assessment for License Application (TSPA-LA) does not take credit for the inner cylinder. This document provides a detailed description of the process-level models that can be applied to assess the performance of Alloy 22 (used for the waste package outer barrier) and Titanium Grade 7 (used for the drip shield) that are subjected to the effects of stress corrosion cracking. The use of laser peening or other residual stress mitigation techniques is considered as a means of mitigating stress corrosion cracking in the waste package final closure lid weld...|$|R
