In the present study fish tests were performed, using larvae of the <b>common</b> flat fish <b>sole</b> (<b>Solea</b> <b>solea),</b> to further investigate properties and variability of F. japonica toxicity. Sole larvae were directly and indirectly exposed to a density range of a Dutch Wadden Sea F. japonica strain, as well as F. japonica cell extracts, for a maximum of 7 days, during which larval mortality was monitored. Most experiments were done at 16 degrees C, however some experiments were performed at 20 degrees C. Furthermore, larvae were exposed to concentration ranges of the alleged toxic compounds, e. g. the brevetoxins PbTx- 2 and PbTx- 3, and three poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) : M, EPA and OTA. The larvae showed highly variable responses to the F. japonica treatments. At the late exponential growth phase of F. japonica highest sole mortality was found: 100 % mortality after 7 days of direct exposure. Indirect and cell extract exposures as well as direct exposure to other growth phases caused lower larval mortality (up to 40 %) after the same incubation period. Temperature had a distinct effect on sole mortality, showing significantly enhanced toxicity at 20 degrees C, compared with 16 degrees C. Exposure to PbTx- 2 showed an LC 50 of 28. 7 ng mL(- 1) after 48 h, while exposure to PbTx- 3 caused no 100 % mortality up to 10 ng mL(- 1).

40|$|Three diets were {{compared}} for the feeding of captive <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> broodstock (<b>Solea</b> <b>solea)</b> kept under ambient photoperiod and temperature conditions. A group of 70 adults {{were caught in}} the wild and the 38 males and 32 females distributed at random in six tanks. All the fish were acclimated to the same semi-moist diet (M) in the pre-experimental period from December to February. Three dietary treatments were offered in the experimental period from March to May with two replicates (tanks) per treatment. The treatments were M alone, M supplemented with fresh mussels (Mytilus edulis) (M + M), and M supplemented with live polychaetes (Perinereis cultrifera) (M + P). Spawning occurred during April and May when water temperature was 17 and 18 degrees C, respectively, and salinity around 34 - 35 ppt. Average daily dry matter intake expressed as a proportion of body weight was M 0. 65 +/- 0. 34 %, M + M 0. 43 +/- 0. 18 %, and M + P 0. 56 +/- 0. 27 %, and differed significantly (P < 0. 05) between treatments. The average daily dry matter intake within a tank ranged from 0. 31 +/- 0. 04 % in February to 0. 98 +/- 0. 26 % in May (P < 0. 05), apparently due to changes in the photo-thermal regime. Diet significantly affected the number of days when spawning occurred, the number of days when hatched eggs were produced, and the proportion of fertilized eggs (P < 0. 05); and affected the number of days on which viable eggs were produced during April (NS). In all cases, the results were lowest for M + M, while those for the other two treatments did not differ significantly. Differences in hatching rate were not significant in April. During May, no spawning occurred in fish given the M + M treatment, and the differences between the other two treatments were not significant. Values for all variates tended to be higher for M + P than M + M in April and lower for M + P and M in May. These results suggest that supplementing the semi-moist diet with mussels depressed feed intake and, consequently, reproductive performance: the semi-moist diet alone and semi-moist diet supplemented with polychaetes allowed satisfactory food intake and reproductive performance in broodstock sole...|$|R

Area specialisation affected the response of individual vessels because vessels without prior experience in the open areas showed a larger decline in catch rate compared with vessels that previously fished in these open areas and were more likely to stop fishing during the closed period.

Macrobenthic community diversity decreased when continen¬tal inputs of organic matter increased, whereas ecosystem production, measured by <b>common</b> <b>sole</b> (<b>Solea</b> <b>solea)</b> fishery yields in the area, increased. Decreases in macrobenthic diversity were mainly related to an increasing abundance of species with specific functional traits, particularly deposit-feeding polychaetes. The decrease in macrobenthic diversity did not result in a decrease, but an increase in ecosystem production, as it enhanced the transfer of continental POM into marine food webs.
