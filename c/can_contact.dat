5|$|Hansen soon finds Bakharev, {{who tells}} him that to disable the radio jammer around the rig so he <b>can</b> <b>contact</b> Bennett, he will need Anischenko to get him past a retinal scanner. Bakharev is then dragged into an air duct and killed. Hansen learns that Kamsky and Bakharev were under orders to make the exocels as {{dangerous}} as possible, which they had succeeded in doing, but without any way to control the resulting creatures. Hansen finds and kills Anischenko, removing his eye and using it to deactivate the radio jammer.

Meanwhile, Anna is rescued from the sea by a large creature and left in a lab, where she is infected by an exocel. Seeing this take place on a security monitor, Hansen races to the lab to give Anna the antidote.|$|E
5|$|With iOS 10.2.1, Apple made {{improvements}} to reduce occurrences of unexpected shutdowns {{that a small}} number of users were experiencing with their iPhone. iOS 10.2.1 already has over 50% of active iOS devices upgraded and the diagnostic data we've received from upgraders shows that for this small percentage of users experiencing the issue, we're seeing a more than 80% reduction in iPhone 6s and over 70% reduction on iPhone 6 of devices unexpectedly shutting down. We also added the ability for the phone to restart without needing to connect to power, if a user still encounters an unexpected shutdown. It {{is important to note that}} these unexpected shutdowns are not a safety issue, but we understand it can be an inconvenience and wanted to fix the issue as quickly as possible. If a customer has any issues with their device they <b>can</b> <b>contact</b> AppleCare.|$|E

The <b>CAN</b> <b>contact</b> person, Shirley Landa, referred her to Rick Ross; based on her endorsement of Ross, Tonkin retained him to deprogram her sons.

25|$|A legal {{resident}} is a spy who operates {{in a foreign}} country under diplomatic cover (e.g., from his country's embassy). He is an official member of the consular staff, such as a commercial, cultural, or military attaché. Thus, he has diplomatic immunity from prosecution and cannot be arrested by the host country if suspected of espionage. The most the host country can do is send him back to his home country. He {{is in charge of the}} residency and the personnel. He is also an official contact who well-known people in government <b>can</b> <b>contact</b> in times of crisis.|$|E
25|$|Storage of {{butadiene}} as a compressed, liquified gas {{carries a}} specific and unusual hazard. Over time, polymerization can begin, creating a crust of solidified material (popcorn polymer, {{named for its}} appearance) inside the vapor space of the cylinder. If the cylinder is then disturbed, the crust <b>can</b> <b>contact</b> the liquid and initiate an auto-catalytic polymerization. The heat released accelerates the reaction, possibly leading to cylinder rupture. Inhibitors are typically added to reduce this hazard, but butadiene cylinders should still be considered short-shelf life items. The hazard presented by popcorn polymer is also present in bulk commercial storage tanks. It {{is important to keep}} the oxygen concentration in the tanks and any process wash water low {{in order to reduce the}} rate of polymerization.|$|E

25|$|Ethel {{had never}} had children, a fact that she regretted in her old-age and so Willy became her {{surrogate}} child, and she loves him dearly. Willy goes everywhere that Ethel goes and so she is devastated when he is kidnapped in 1986. She searches for him everywhere and even holds a seance {{to see if she}} <b>can</b> <b>contact</b> him, but Willy is nowhere to be found. Detective Roy Quick (Douglas Fielding) works on the case and eventually finds Willy in the possession of an old Latvian refugee, who has renamed him Rasputin. Willy is returned to an overjoyed Ethel, although she has to pay the man in order to get him to relinquish ownership. Ethel has been a lifelong friend of Lou Beale (Anna Wing) and Dot Cotton (June Brown) and the trio remain close in their old-age. They can often be found reminiscing or gossiping in The Queen Victoria public house, where Ethel also regularly thrills the punters with her repartee, her version of the cancan, or her plain sense of fun. Out of the three Ethel is the most light-hearted and she is never frightened {{to stand up to the}} over-bearing Lou and interfering Dot. She has her run-ins with both over the years, and yet their friendship endures right to the last.|$|E

500|$|Grunge concerts {{were known}} for being straightforward, high-energy performances. Grunge shows were [...] "...celebrations, parties [...] carnivals" [...] where the {{audience}} expressed its spirit by stagediving, moshing and thrashing.

[...] While grunge lyrical themes focused on [...] "angst and rage", the audience at shows were positive and created a [...] "life-affirming" [...] attitude. Grunge bands rejected the complex and high budget presentations of many mainstream musical genres, {{including the use of}} complex digitally controlled light arrays, pyrotechnics, and other visual effects then popular in [...] "hair metal" [...] shows. Grunge performers viewed these elements unrelated to playing the music. Stage acting and [...] "onstage theatrics" [...] were generally avoided.|$|E
