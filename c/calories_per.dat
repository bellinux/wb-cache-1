5|$|A decade-long {{study of}} urine and faecal samples at the Gunung Palung Orangutan Conservation Project in West Kalimantan {{has shown that}} orangutans give birth {{during and after the}} high fruit season (though not every year), during which they consume various {{abundant}} fruits, totalling up to 11,000 <b>calories</b> <b>per</b> day. In the low-fruit season, they eat whatever fruit is available in addition to tree bark and leaves, with daily intake at only 2,000 calories. Together with a long lactation period, orangutans also have a long birth interval.|$|E
25|$|This ration was {{designed}} to meet a minimum daily average of 2457 <b>calories</b> <b>per</b> person, the emergency caloric requirement set by the UN according to a 1985 WHO report on protein and energy requirements. When the direct distribution system was initiated in 1987, the energy supplied by a basic UNBRO ration was 2237 <b>calories</b> <b>per</b> person per day. In 1991 budgetary constraints forced UNBRO to reduce this basic ration to 2027 <b>calories</b> <b>per</b> person per day. Food distributions included 120grams a month of soap.|$|E

25|$|However, {{more recent}} studies have {{depicted}} living standards in 18th century China and pre-Industrial Revolution Europe as comparable. Life expectancy in China and Japan for adult males were 39.6 and 41.1 respectively, compared with 34 for England, between 27.5 and 30 for France, and 24.7 for Prussia. Chinese laborers in the Yangtze delta consumed 4,600 <b>calories</b> <b>per</b> day on average (laborers in China overall consumed 2,637 calories on average) compared with 2,000-2,500 <b>calories</b> <b>per</b> day for England. According to Pomeranz and others, there was modest per capita growth in both regions, the Chinese economy was not stagnant, and in many areas, especially agriculture, was ahead of Western Europe. Chinese cities were also ahead in public health. Economic historian Paul Bairoch estimated that China's GNP per capita in 1800 was $228 in 1960 US dollars ($ in 1990 dollars), higher than Western Europe's $213 ($ in 1990 dollars) at the time.|$|E

30|$|The {{results also}} {{reveal that the}} adopter group is also {{significantly}} distinguishable in terms of food security status, {{measured in terms of}} household food <b>calorie</b> intake/day <b>per</b> adult equivalent. As far as calorie intake is concerned, adopters of adaptation options tend to have higher calorie intake as compared to the non-adopters. The mean <b>calorie</b> intake/day <b>per</b> adult equivalent is 4508 and 1549  kcal for adopters and non-adopters, respectively (Table  1). The t test result also shows that there exists a significant and positive difference between the two adopter groups in their <b>calorie</b> intake/day <b>per</b> adult equivalent.|$|R

25|$|French fries {{primarily}} contain carbohydrates {{from the}} potato (mostly {{in the form}} of starch) and fat absorbed during the deep-frying process, as well as sodium depending upon the seasoning. For example, a large serving of French fries at McDonald's in the United States is 154 grams. Nearly all of the 500 <b>calories</b> <b>per</b> serving come from the 63 g of carbohydrates and the 25 g of fat, but a serving also contains 6 g of protein and 350mg of sodium.|$|E
25|$|An {{exclusively}} breastfed baby {{depends on}} breast milk completely {{so it is}} important for the mother to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and especially a good diet. Consumption of 1,500–1,800 <b>calories</b> <b>per</b> day could coincide with a weight loss of 450grams (one pound) per week. While mothers in famine conditions can produce milk with highly nutritional content, a malnourished mother may produce milk with decreased levels of several micronutrients such as iron, zinc, and vitamin B12. She may also have a lower supply than well-fed mothers.|$|E
25|$|In early 1946 U.S. President Harry S. Truman allowed foreign relief {{organizations}} to enter Germany {{in order to}} review the food situation. In mid-1946 non-German relief organizations were permitted to help starving German children. The German food situation became worst during the very cold winter of 1946–47, when German calorie intake ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 <b>calories</b> <b>per</b> day, a situation made worse by severe lack of fuel for heating. Average adult calorie intake in the U.S was 3,200–3,300, in the UK 2,900 and in the U.S. Army 4,000.|$|E
50|$|The tonne of {{trinitrotoluene}} (TNT) {{is used as}} a {{proxy for}} energy, usually of explosions (TNT is a common high explosive).

25|$|Sodium methoxide, triethyl phosphine, ferric {{chloride}} and certain other metal compounds catalyze {{the formation of}} the MIC-trimer, while the high-molecular-weight polymer formation is catalyzed by certain trialkylamines. Since {{the formation of the}} MIC trimer is exothermic (298 <b>calories</b> <b>per</b> gram of MIC), the reaction can lead to violent boiling of the MIC. The high-molecular-weight polymer hydrolyzes in hot water to form the trimethyl isocyanurate. Since catalytic metal salts can be formed from impurities in commercial grade MIC and steel, this product must not be stored in steel drums or tanks.|$|E
25|$|Potatoes yield abundantly {{with little}} effort, and adapt readily to diverse climates {{as long as}} the climate is cool and moist enough for the plants to gather {{sufficient}} water from the soil to form the starchy tubers. Potatoes do not keep very well in storage and are vulnerable to molds that feed on the stored tubers and quickly turn them rotten, whereas crops such as grain can be stored for several years with a low risk of rot.

25|$|Farming, which, {{the authors}} note, {{produces}} 10 to 100 times more <b>calories</b> <b>per</b> acre than foraging, carried this trend further. Over {{the period from}} 10,000 BC to AD 1, the world population increased about a hundredfold - estimates range from 40 to 170 times. An accelerated rate of evolution {{is a direct result}} of the larger human population. More people will have more mutations, thereby increasing opportunity for evolutionary change under natural selection. The spread of rapidly expanding populations eventually outpaced the spread of favourable mutations under selection in those populations, so for the ﬁrst time in human history favourable mutations could not fully disperse throughout the human species. In addition, of course, selection pressures changed once farming was adopted, favouring distinctive adaptations in different geographic areas.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} energy expenditure patterns using the triaxial accelerometer {{and to identify}} the association of energy expenditure with clinical parameters in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Estimates of energy expenditures represented by total activity calorie (TA), physical activity calorie (PA), total activity <b>calorie</b> <b>per</b> body weight (TABW), and physical activity <b>calorie</b> <b>per</b> body weight (PABW) of 49 female SLE patients were assessed using the RT 3 triaxial accelerometer (StayHealthy, Monrovia, CA) in a sevenday period. SLE patients in the highest body mass index (BMI) tertile showed significantly lower values of TABW compared {{to those in the}} lowest tertile, while SLE patients in the lowest TABW tertile showed significantly higher body weight, waist circumference, BMI, SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI), dosage of prednisone, and blood pressure. There was a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome and SLE patients with metabolic syndrome showed significantly lower TABW. In addition, both TABW and PABW significantly but negatively correlated with SLEDAI. In conclusion, the RT 3 accelerometer is suitable for evaluating total and physical activity-related energy expenditure in patients with SLE. TABW measured by the triaxial accelerometer is inversely related with body weight status and disease activity in SLE patients. This suggests that estimates of energy expenditure by the tri-axial accelerometer may be applied in the management of SLE...|$|R
