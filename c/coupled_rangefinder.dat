5000|$|The Mamiya Six, {{also known}} as the Mamiya-6, is a series of folding medium-format {{rangefinder}} cameras manufactured by Mamiya between 1940 and the late 1950s. The cameras captured twelve 6 cm × 6 cm images on 120 film rolls. Some later models could also take sixteen 4.5 cm × 6 cm images. The cameras were <b>coupled</b> <b>rangefinders,</b> but had a unique focusing mechanism that moved the film plane instead of the lens. The lenses were not interchangeable, and were made by various Japanese manufacturers. Beginning with the model IV, the name on the top plate changed from [...] "Mamiya Six" [...] (two lines) to [...] "Mamiya-6".|$|R

5000|$|The C3 was {{introduced}} in October 1939 as an improved version of the C (1938-9) and C2 (1938-42). All three models shared the same [...] "brick" [...] design, attributed to Gustave Fassin, but the C3 {{was by far the}} most successful. The original Argus C was equipped with an uncoupled rangefinder which required the user to manually rotate the lens barrel to match the rangefinder reading, while the C2 <b>coupled</b> the <b>rangefinder</b> to the lens to allow one-step focusing. The C3 added built-in flash synchronization but was otherwise identical to the C2. It originally retailed for $35, equivalent to $ in current dollars.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Balda Baldessa 1b. Introduced in 1958, the 1b model had a <b>coupled</b> <b>rangefinder</b> and {{introduced}} an uncoupled light meter to the series.|$|E
5000|$|The Robot Royal has [...] "Kinographic" [...] {{capability}} of 4 or 5 exposures per second. It has a <b>coupled</b> <b>rangefinder,</b> and {{a choice of}} eight bayonet-mount interchangeable lenses.|$|E
50|$|The Leica III uses a <b>coupled</b> <b>rangefinder</b> {{distinct}} from the viewfinder. The viewfinder is set for a 50mm lens; use of shorter or longer lenses requires installing an alternate viewfinder on the accessory socket.|$|E
50|$|The Leica II {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1932, with a built in <b>rangefinder</b> <b>coupled</b> to the lens focusing mechanism. This model has a separate viewfinder (showing a reduced image) and rangefinder. In 1932 the flange to filmplane was standardised to 28.8mm, first implemented on Leica model C, and the Leica Standard the next year.|$|R
50|$|The C was {{replaced}} within {{just a few}} months by the C2, with a geared <b>coupling</b> between the <b>rangefinder</b> and the lens, greatly accelerating focusing and making the camera much more convenient to use. Finally, in 1939 the C3 was introduced, with electrical plugs on the cameras left side for a battery-powered flash, synchronized to the shutter.|$|R
5000|$|The Signet 35 has a <b>coupled</b> {{coincident}} image <b>rangefinder,</b> {{an excellent}} Ektar 44mm f3.5 lens with rear helicoid focus, automatic film stop counter with double exposure prevention, all {{built into a}} sturdy cast aluminum alloy body. The shutter must be cocked manually, and only it only had four shutter speeds. [...] The Signet 35 is very different in appearance, function, and durability, {{from the rest of}} the Signet line.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interlocking}} slats were aligned by specially made silk ribbons, {{which were}} very strong but subject to wear. The <b>coupled</b> <b>rangefinder</b> {{had a very}} long baseline, with its own eyepiece next {{to that of the}} viewfinder.|$|E
50|$|The dual-format X-System {{comprised}} the XPan and XPan II, and was Hasselblad's first camera to use 35mm film. Built with a rubber-covered titanium and aluminium body, {{they were designed}} as a <b>coupled</b> <b>rangefinder</b> camera with interchangeable, compact lenses.|$|E
50|$|RF645: Introduced May 2000, {{production}} discontinued September 2005. Extremely light and compact 6x4.5 cm film format <b>coupled</b> <b>rangefinder</b> camera system with four interchangeable leaf shutter lenses: 45mm, 65mm, 100mm and 135mm. The 135mm Tele Lens soon was discontinued due to calibration {{problems of the}} rangefinder-system. Dedicated flash (RF20) and special polarizer kit.|$|E
5000|$|The {{camera was}} {{designed}} in 1938, but the Second World War prevented its release, which finally occurred in 1945. The first Foca models were named [...] "PF" [...] (for petit format, [...] "small format") and distinguished {{by the number}} of stars. They had focal plane shutter and interchangeable lenses on a screw mounting. The [...] "PF1" [...] (one star), later named [...] "Standard", was the basic version without rangefinder. After 1949, the company developed a bayonet mount version, called [...] "Universel", with a series of lenses all <b>coupled</b> to the <b>rangefinder.</b> Optique & Précision de Levallois (in short OPL) made its own lenses under the brand [...] "Oplar" [...] and derivatives ("Oplarex", [...] "Oplex"...).|$|R
50|$|A {{rangefinder}} {{camera is}} a camera {{fitted with a}} rangefinder, typically a split-image rangefinder: a range-finding focusing mechanism allowing the photographer to measure the subject distance and take photographs that are in sharp focus. Most varieties of rangefinder show two images of the same subject, one of which moves when a calibrated wheel is turned; when the two images coincide and fuse into one, the distance can be read off the wheel. Older, non-coupled rangefinder cameras display the focusing distance and require the photographer to transfer the value to the lens focus ring; cameras without built-in rangefinders could have an external rangefinder fitted into the accessory shoe. Earlier cameras of this type had separate viewfinder and rangefinder windows; later the rangefinder was incorporated into the viewfinder. More modern designs have <b>rangefinders</b> <b>coupled</b> to the focusing mechanism, so that the lens is focused correctly when the rangefinder images fuse; compare with the focusing screen in non-autofocus SLRs.|$|R
50|$|It has {{the typical}} big finder of the Optima series, {{but on this}} special model it is {{combined}} with a superimposed <b>coupled</b> <b>rangefinder.</b> Shutter speed is controlled electronically by a CdS meter, with speeds from 15 sec. to 1/1000 sec. A special feature of the series is the film advance lever which can be switched to also rewind the film at its end.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{models of}} [...] "Automatic" [...] Retinas followed, on the IIS frame, without {{interchangeable}} lenses, but with coupled (automatic)metering, where in auto-mode the meter adjusted the aperture. The Automatic II and Automatic III had an upgraded lens and shutter from the Automatic I. The Automatic I and Automatic II {{did not have}} a rangefinder, but the Automatic III had a <b>coupled</b> <b>rangefinder.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Zorki 10 is a fixed-lens Zorki <b>coupled</b> <b>rangefinder</b> {{camera with}} an {{integrated}} light meter. Selenium meter cells surround the lens. This {{was the first}} fully automatic camera produced in the former Soviet Union, {{as well as the}} first to use ASA/DIN markings rather than the Soviet GOST numbers, however these ASA numbers were still mostly useless as they didn't match any known film speeds (some Zorki 10 cameras apparently had GOST numbers instead of ASA though, as it's shown in a Polish camera manual).|$|E
50|$|Since the {{beginning}} of Zeiss as a photographic lens manufacturer, it has had a licensing programme which allows other manufacturers to produce its lenses. Over the years its licensees included Voigtländer, Bausch & Lomb, Ross, Koristka, Krauss, Kodak. etc. In the 1970s, the western operation of Zeiss-Ikon got together with Yashica to produce the new Contax cameras, {{and many of the}} Zeiss lenses for this camera, among others, were produced by Yashica's optical arm, Tomioka. Yashica's owner Kyocera ended camera production in 2006. Yashica lenses were then made by Cosina, who also manufactured most of the new Zeiss designs for the new Zeiss Ikon <b>coupled</b> <b>rangefinder</b> camera. Another licensee active today is Sony who uses the Zeiss name on lenses on its video and digital still cameras.|$|E
5000|$|The Petri (ペトリ) Camera Company was {{an optical}} company and {{manufacturer}} of cameras in Japan. It {{was founded in}} 1907. Prior to World War II, it was known as Kuribayashi Shashin Kōgyō or Kuribayashi Camera Industry, inc. Japan (the company name means [...] "Acorn Grove"). In 1962 it {{changed its name to}} Petri Camera Ltd. In 1963 the company produced the cult model, the Petri 7S Circle-Eye System <b>coupled</b> <b>rangefinder,</b> leaf-shuttered model, that was used by some professionals in the 1960s, and that was so well built that this model is still used by enthusiasts today and has a following amongst street photographer artists. This was followed by the very successful Petri 7S 11 in 1966 [...] Both models had colour corrected lenses.|$|E

50|$|Made between 1932 and 1936, the {{original}} Contax, known as Contax I after later models were introduced, was markedly {{different from the}} corresponding Leica. Using a die-cast alloy body it housed a vertically travelling metal focal-plane shutter reminiscent of the one used in Contessa-Nettel cameras, made out of interlocking blackened brass slats somewhat like a roll-up garage door. This complex shutter became the characteristic of the Contax camera and its Super-Nettel derivative. By contrast, the competitive Leica followed the established design of using rubberized fabric shutter curtains wound around rollers, moving horizontally. The Contax design allowed a higher maximum shutter speed: the top speed was 1/1000s, then increased to 1/1250s in the Contax II. The fact the shutter ran across the shorter dimension of the format area was a significant factor for achieving this technical feat. The interlocking slats were aligned by specially woven silk ribbons, which were very strong but subject to wear. Replacing these ribbons was difficult but, contrary to modern cameras, made for a 400,000-cycle life.Zeiss also invented the System Camera, {{with all sorts of}} near-photo, wide-angle, mirror-house, long-focal-length lenses for specific situations. However Zeiss called it Universalkamera.One of the key design features was a <b>coupled</b> <b>rangefinder</b> with a very long baseline, with its own eyepiece next to that of the viewfinder. To enhance accuracy, a novel rotating wedge system was employed in lieu of the common swinging mirror mechanism. Other main features included focusing drive built into the camera body for use with standard lens, removable back, shutter-speed knob integral with film-wind knob placed {{at the front of the}} camera body, and black-enamelled finish.|$|E
5000|$|The first Retina, Nr. 117, was {{introduced}} in late July 1934. The successive model: Nr 118 Retina followed in 1935 with minor modifications to the Nr. 117. The Nr. 119 Retina (I) and the more expensive Nr. 126 Retina (I) follow in 1936. Nr. 117, Nr. 118 and Nr. 119 Retina cameras all had black lacquered top housings, black lacquered body edges and nickel-plated control surfaces. Nr. 126 Retina (I) was the first with a chrome-plated finish to the top housing, chrome-plated top deck below the rewind knob and chrome-plated control surfaces with the body edges being polished aluminum alloy with a clear lacquer coat. Nr. 122 Retina II {{was introduced}} in 1936 with a separate <b>coupled</b> <b>rangefinder</b> and viewfinder and at this point, Nr. 119 and Nr. 126 Retina cameras were designated as [...] "Retina I" [...] cameras. The Nr. 122 Retina II had a problematic film advance lever and was replaced in June 1937 by the Nr. 142 Retina II with {{a return to the}} knob advance. Nr. 141 Retina I is a chrome finished model with a shutter release on the top body which {{was introduced in}} late 1937. Nr. 143 Retina I was the black lacquer/nickel-plated version of the Nr. 141 Retina I introduced in early 1938. The identification of Retina I cameras is based on the finish and configuration of the top housings of each camera and should NOT be based on lens/shutter or serial number, as lenses, shutters and back doors can be easily interchanged by repairman. In 1939 a Nr. 150 Retina IIa was introduced to replace the Nr. 142 Retina II, but it was unrelated to the flash capable Type 016 Retina IIa series of the early 1950s. Also in 1939, the Nr. 148 Retina I and the Nr. 149 Retina I with double exposure prevention are introduced. Late versions of the Type 148 Retina I have a black lacquer finish to the body edges. The last pre-war Retina I is the Nr. 167 Retina I which was manufactured in July 1941 and was for export only. The Nr. 167 Retina I was a [...] "Retina" [...] version of the Nr. 160 Retinette II with basically the same body, but with [...] "Retina" [...] embossed on the back door and a chrome-plated top housing and chrome-plated deck under the rewind knob.|$|E
