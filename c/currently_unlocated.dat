[...] The two most notable pewholders were George Mason and George Washington; other pews were kept by William Triplett, George William Fairfax, Alexander Henderson, Lund Washington (cousin of George), John Manley, Martin Cockburn, and Daniel McCarty. The eight pews located in the west end of the church were set aside for [...] "Inhabitants and House Keepers of the Parish".|$|E
50|$|Maria Peale (1787-1866) was an American painter, {{primarily}} of still-lifes. She {{was the daughter}} of James Peale, the niece of Charles Willson Peale and the sister of Margaretta Angelica Peale, Sarah Miriam Peale, and Anna Claypoole Peale, but unlike her sisters she never pursued an artistic career. She only exhibited one painting, a still-life of vegetables; <b>currently</b> <b>unlocated,</b> it was shown at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1811. No works by her are known to be extant, although a Still Life with Oranges, Pansies, and Liqueur has been tentatively ascribed to her. In the 1820s she and Margaretta assumed the responsibility of caring for their parents, freeing Anna and Sarah to pursue their careers.|$|E

5000|$|On {{his return}} to the United States in 1874, he opened a studio in New York. [...] He painted for many years out of his studio in the Old University Building of New York University. [...] Painting in the Adirondack Mountains and later in Waterford, Connecticut, Minor soon became known for his landscapes {{resembling}} the Barbizon School. Under the influence of George Inness and Alexander Helwig Wyant, he also began to paint in a Tonalist style. His painting Great Silas at Night (1890) displays his adoption of the Tonalist style while his lingering Barbizon style can be seen in A Hillside Pasture. [...] From the 1890s until his death, Minor exhibited frequently with the Tonalists in New York. In 1897, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Design, New York. In 1900, Minor achieved the height of his success at the Evans sale, where his painting The Close of Day fetched $3,050. This painting is <b>currently</b> <b>unlocated.</b>|$|E
50|$|Born in Abbeville, Déhérain was a pupil of Hortense Haudebourt-Lescot {{prior to}} her {{marriage}} to magistrate Alexandre Déhérain. The couple had a son, Pierre, who became a botanist and a daughter who became a portraitist. Herminie Déhérain exhibited at the Paris Salon beginning in 1827 and continuing until the year of her death; in 1831 she won a second-class medal, and in 1833 receiving plaudits from critics for a portrait of Antonin Moine, today owned by the musée national des châteaux de Versailles et de Trianon. She won notice for her religious paintings, too, including a depiction of Christ in the Garden of Olives that today hangs in the Collegiate Church of St. Wolfram at Abbeville, and not long before her death she produced a volume, Pious Images, containing lithographs after her drawings by Pierre Joseph Challemal. Déhérain died in Paris; an obituary notes a collection of unpublished writings, including manuscripts {{on the role of}} women in the arts and the beginning of a novel, which was left behind.

5000|$|Shegogue {{was born}} in Charleston, South Carolina, and was of French extraction; little is known of his training, though {{it has been said}} he {{traveled}} in Europe and studied there in his early years. Around 1833 he exhibited a painting titled An Old Straw Hat, <b>currently</b> <b>unlocated,</b> at the American Academy of Fine Arts; this was the first piece he showed publicly. Among the artists whose notice it attracted was John Trumbull. In 1839 his name was listed on the register of students at the National Academy of Design, but he is known to have already developed a reputation as an artist. In 1846 he traveled to Europe for a year of study, prompting a critic for the Literary World to observe that he had already seen [...] "no small degree of success as a painter of portraits in fancy dresses, with an occasional fancy face." [...] He returned to Europe for other painting trips during his career; on one of these a copy of Guido Reni's Aurora which he painted in the Palazzo Borghese for a New York client won praise from the Princess Borghese.|$|E
