40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{report the}} palladium-catalyzed <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> aryl halides with ammonia and gaseous amines as their {{ammonium}} salts. The <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> aryl chlorides and ortho-substituted aryl bromides with ammonium sulfate forms anilines with higher selectivity {{for the primary}} arylamine over the diarylamine than couplings with ammonia in dioxane. The resting state for the reactions of aryl chlorides {{is different from the}} resting state for the reactions of aryl bromides, and this change in resting states is proposed to account for a difference in selectivities for reactions of the two haloarenes. The transition-metal-catalyzed amination of aryl electro-philes has become a useful method to construct arylamines. However, the <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> ammonia is less developed than the <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> alkylamines, and several properties of ammonia make the <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> this reagent more challenging than the <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> alkylamines. Ammonia is a good σ-donor and binds more strongly to metals than do alkylamines, and this binding can lead to catalyst deactivation. In addition, the moderate basicity and low acidity of ammonia disfavor proton exchanges to or from thi...|$|R
40|$|Gender's {{knowledge}} about marriage by <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> {{the same sex}} (special for homosexual couple) in Indonesia Marriage by <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> the same sex is not legal by law in Indonesia {{but there are many}} <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> the same sex who get married in other countries which the marriage by <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> the same sex is legal or just live together without marriage. In this writing there are two problems that appear. Firstly, how marriage by <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> the same sex (special for homosexual couple) viewed by gender's perspective and connected to Indonesian Marriage act. Secondly, how the reality <b>of</b> marriage by <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> the same sex in Indonesia connected to Indonesian Marriage acts. This law research using normative law research. Data source using secondary data consist of primary law substance and secondary law substance. Vertically law systematization using derogation principle with basis of law conduct is lex superior derogate legi inferiori. Horizontally law systematization using noncontradiction principle with basis of law conduct is lex specialist derogate legi generalist. This writing using deductive principle to get the conclusion. Marriage by <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> the same sex, by homosexual couple or lesbian couple can be correct if it is looking at from gender because position of the man as a husband changes to be a wife and the other way position of the woman as a wife changes to be a husband. In Indonesia, marriage by <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> the same sex is not legal by law. Because the Indonesian marriage acts only legalize marriage by {{a man and a woman}} (marriage by the different sex). So if the couples by same sex want to get married, they must go to the other countries which the marriage by <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> the same sex is legal, like Netherland, Canada, or Spanish. In Jakarta, there is one foundation named Arus Pelangi who gives facilities for <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> the same sex to make an agreement if they want to live together but they are not married. This Agreement is made for <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> the same sex when they want to live together and mixed their property. So if they separated, there is not property struggle between them. This foundation also give law protect for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transsexual in Indonesia. ...|$|R
