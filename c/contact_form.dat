25|$|The {{receptor}} {{is normally}} triggered via direct cell-to-cell contact, {{in which the}} transmembrane proteins of the cells in direct <b>contact</b> <b>form</b> the ligands that bind the notch receptor. The Notch binding allows groups of cells to organize themselves such that, if one cell expresses a given trait, this may be switched off in neighbouring cells by the intercellular notch signal. In this way, groups of cells influence one another to make large structures. Thus, lateral inhibition mechanisms are key to Notch signaling. lin-12 and Notch mediate binary cell fate decisions, and lateral inhibition involves feedback mechanisms to amplify initial differences.|$|E

However, cylindrical contact homology is not always defined due to the presence of holomorphic discs and a lack of regularity and transversality results.
