25|$|These unusual {{regulators}} {{were designed}} by Robert J. Dempster and made at his factory in Illinois, USA, from 1961 to 1965. The Demone Mark I and Demone Mark II are both two-stage regulators. The second-stage looks like the mouthpiece of a twin-hose regulator but has a small diaphragm on the front. The second-stage valve is inside the mouthpiece tube. The exhaled air goes into a corrugated <b>coaxial</b> <b>exhaust</b> hose which surrounds the intermediate-pressure hose and discharges about 60% of {{the way back to}} the first-stage to keep the bubbles away from the diver's face. Near the mouthpiece is a one-way valve to let outside water into the exhaust hose to avoid free flow if the diaphragm (at the mouth) is below the open end of the exhaust hose. The Mark I has hoses only on one side, and the Mark II has twinned intermediate-pressure hoses, each with its own <b>coaxial</b> <b>exhaust</b> hose and second stage, one assembly on each side of the diver's head, but with both second stages in the same mouthpiece housing and operated by the same diaphragm. This version has no large visible regulator.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of a highly configurable triple digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) system is described, which is capable of acquiring both continuous, statistically independent measurements at up to 14 Hz and time-resolved PIV data at MHz rates. The system was used at QinetiQ's Noise Test Facility (NTF) {{as part of the}} EU-funded CoJeN programme to obtain measurements from high subsonic (Mach <= 0. 9), hot (similar to 500 degrees C), large (1 / 10 th) scale coaxial jet flows at a standoff distance of similar to 1 m. High-resolution time-averaged velocity and turbulence data were obtained for complete <b>coaxial</b> engine <b>exhaust</b> plumes down to 4 m (20 jet diameters) from the nozzle exit in less than 1 h. In addition, the system allowed volumetric data to be obtained, enabling fast assessment of spatial alignment of nozzle configurations. Furthermore, novel six-frame time-series data-capture is demonstrated up to 330 kHz, used to calculate time-space correlations within the exhaust, allowing for study of spatio-temporal developments in the jet, associated with jet-noise production. The highly automated system provides synchronization triggers for simultaneous acquisition from different measurement systems (e. g. LDA) and is shown to be versatile, rugged, reliable and portable, operating remotely in a hostile environment. Data are presented for three operating conditions and two nozzle geometries, providing a database to be used to validate CFD models of coaxial jet flow...|$|R
40|$|Technology for {{simulating}} plumes in {{wind tunnel}} tests was not adequate {{to provide the}} required confidence in test data where plume induced aerodynamic effects might be significant. A broad research program was undertaken to correct the deficiency. Four tasks within the program are reported. Three of these tasks involve conducting experiments, related to three {{different aspects of the}} plume simulation problem: (1) base pressures; (2) lateral jet pressures; and (3) plume parameters. The fourth task involves collecting all of the base pressure test data generated during the program. Base pressures were measured on a classic cone ogive cylinder body as affected by the <b>coaxial,</b> high temperature <b>exhaust</b> plumes of a variety of solid propellant rockets. Valid data were obtained at supersonic freestream conditions but not at transonic. Pressure data related to lateral (separation) jets at M infinity = 4. 5, for multiple clustered nozzles canted to the freestream and operating at high dynamic pressure ratios. All program goals were met although the model hardware was found to be large relative to the wind tunnel size so that operation was limited for some nozzle configurations...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{continuation}} of the study described in Part I and deals with the flight effects on noise from heated jets. The present work shows that <b>coaxial</b> <b>exhaust</b> flows with inverted profiles are much quieter than flows with conventional profiles. Among all possible coaxial configurations with only one of the streams heated conventional profile, inverted profile, and the variable stream control engine (VSCE) cycle - and holding constant mass flow and thrust, a VSCE cycle is the best possible engine cycle as it provides over 18 -dB reduction in sound pressure level (as compared to noise from a conventional profile cycle) at all angles, both statically and in flight. The study also indicates that, if both the coaxial streams are heated unequally, a duct-burning profile, combined with the variable stream control engine (DB-VSCE) concept, gives rise to a powerful coaxial device which generates the least noise, both statically and in flight. This concept will be of paramount importance {{as one of the most}} variable nozzle designs of the future...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{reducing}} large-scale mixing noise from dual-stream jets is presented. The principle is {{reduction of the}} convective Mach number of turbulent eddies that produce intense downward sound radiation. In a jet representing the <b>coaxial</b> <b>exhaust</b> of a turbofan engine, this is achieved by tilting downward, by a few degrees, the bypass (secondary) plume relative to the core (primary) plume. The misalignment of the two flows creates a thick low-speed secondary core {{on the underside of}} the high-speed primary flow. The secondary core reduces the convective Mach number of primary eddies, thus hindering their ability to generate sound that travels to the downward acoustic far field. Tilting of the bypass stream is possible by means of fixed or variable vanes installed near the exit of the bypass duct. Subscale aeroacoustic experiments simulated the exhaust flow of a turbofan engine with bypass ratio 6. 0. Deflection of the bypass stream resulted in suppression of the peak overall sound pressure level by 4. 5 dB and the effective perceived noise level by 2. 8 dB. For the nozzle configuration used, the thrust loss is estimated at around 0. 5 % with the vanes activated and 0. 15 % with the vanes deactivated.

40|$|The {{thermodynamics}} and acoustics of a fixed-cycle, {{bypass ratio}} 3 supersonic engine with an innovative noise suppression scheme is explored. The silencing method entails installation of variable turning vanes in the by-pass exhaust of a separate-flow turbofan engine. During noise-sensitive segments of flight, the vanes impart a slight downward tilt to the bypass plume {{relative to the}} core plume, thus thickening the bypass stream {{on the underside of}} the jet. This results in a reduction of the convective Mach number of instability waves that produce intense downward sound radiation. Subscale experiments show that, relative to the mixed-flow <b>exhaust,</b> the <b>coaxial</b> separate-flow <b>exhaust</b> with vanes reduces the peak overall sound pressure level by 8 dB and the effective perceived noise level by 7 dB. The noise-equivalent specific thrust on takeoff is reduced from 490 to 390 m/s. Compared to a current-generation low-bypass turbofan engine, the bypass ratio 3 engine is estimated to be 13 dB quieter with the mixed-flow exhaust and 20 dB quieter with the aforementioned suppression scheme. The vane configuration of this study is estimated to cause a thrust loss of 1 % at takeoff and 0. 25 % at supersonic cruise.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the design, development and deployment of a high-speed jet flow measurement system. The apparatus {{was created in}} response to the need to collect a large quantity of statistically-converged aerodynamic data from a series of commercial turbofan engine models. This acquisition was performed in conjunction with acoustic measurements as part of the ED CoJeN project to investigate jet noise production, and associated noise reduction techniques. Particle Image Velocimetry is a well established flow measurement technique, but its application outside of the laboratory can be limited by a relatively low sample rate and' the need to operate in a hostile environment. This thesis presents a multiple camera technique - used {{as the basis for the}} j et measurement system - that is capable of acquiring both time-series PIV data at MHz rates, and continuous, statistically independent measurements at up to 14 Hz. The resultant PIV measurement rig was therefore capable of acquiring time-averaged velocity and turbulence data from the whole of a 110 scale <b>coaxial</b> engine <b>exhaust</b> plume (down to 4 m or 20 D) in no more than 1 hour. The - 500 aC Mach: 5 0. 9 jets were also scanned volumetrically in order to check the spatial alignment of the nozzle and flow streams,. and all PIV measurements were synchronised to simultaneous LDA acquisition, thus enabling the data to be validated. Finally, the cameras were used to acquire novel 6 -frame time-series data at: 5 330 kHz, which was used to calculate time-space correlations within the exhaust. By providing a highly automated and completely remote-controlled system, the exhaust measurements could be repeated over 3 operating conditions and 2 nozzle geometries, thereby providing a comprehensive description of the flow field. The data, having been systematically post-processed, has been shown to agree well with concurrent measurements, and it will now be used to validate CFD models of coaxial jet flow. By improving the quality of computational flow prediction in this way, the time taken to design and test quieter jet engines will be significantly reduced.

40|$|Prior {{papers have}} shown the {{potentials}} of gasoline-like internal combustion engines fitted with Rankine cycle systems to deliver Diesel-like steady state fuel conversion efficiencies recovering the exhaust and the coolant waste heat with off-the-shelf components. In addition to the pros of the technology significantly increasing steady state efficiencies - up to 5 % in absolute values and much more in relative values - these papers also mentioned the cons of the technology, increased backpressures, increased weight, more complex packaging, more complex control, troublesome transient operation, and finally the cold start issues that prevent the uptake of the technology. This paper further explores the option to use Rankine cycle systems to improve the fuel economy of vehicles under normal driving conditions. A single Rankine cycle system is integrated here with the engine design. A latest turbocharged 1. 6 L direct injection engine has the coolant circuit modified to serve as pre-heater for the Rankine cycle fluid. This fluid is then vaporised and superheated in the boiler/superheater <b>coaxial</b> to the <b>exhaust</b> pipe located downstream of the turbocharger turbine and the closed coupled catalytic converter. The exhaust ports are insulated to reduce the heat losses. The pump of the Rankine cycle system is electrically operated. The expander of the Rankine cycle system drives a generator to recharge the traction battery pack. The thermal engine {{is connected to the}} transmission through an electric clutch and a motor/generator that permits to supplement/replace the thermal engine energy supply, recover the braking energy and start/stop the thermal engine. The integrated Rankine cycle system is intended to permit short warming-up profiles, reduced heat losses and reduced weight and packaging issues, delivering significant benefits during cold start driving cycles as the NEDC in addition to the long term, constant load and speed extra urban driving...|$|R
