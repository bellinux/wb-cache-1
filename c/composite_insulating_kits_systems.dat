40|$|The <b>Kit</b> <b>system,</b> {{including}} <b>Kit</b> ligand and its receptor Kit, has critical {{roles in}} mammalian reproduction, {{especially in the}} ovary. Unlike mammalian species, two copies of genes {{are present in the}} zebrafish genome for both ligand (kitlga and kitlgb) and receptor (kita and kitb). Phylogenetic and chromo-some synteny analyses suggest that these duplicated genes were likely derived from the third round of genome duplication in vertebrate evolution. All four <b>Kit</b> <b>system</b> members were expressed in the zebrafish ovary, suggesting potential roles for the system in ovarian development and function. As the first step toward understanding the <b>Kit</b> <b>system</b> in the zebrafish ovary, especially the differential roles of different forms of ligand and receptor, the present study was undertaken to analyze the temporal expression profiles of the <b>Kit</b> <b>system</b> during folliculo-genesis. All members of the <b>Kit</b> <b>system</b> exhibited significant and distinct variation in expression, particularly in the periovulatory period. During the transition from the primary growth to secondary growth, kitlga showed a dramatic increase, suggesting a role for Kit signaling in follicle recruitment. During final oocyte maturation, kitlga expression significantly decreased after a transitional surge before germinal vesicle breakdown, whereas all other members exhibited an increased expression, with kitlgb and kita reaching the peak expression levels in the ovulated eggs. Our results provide strong evidence that the <b>Kit</b> <b>system</b> is involved in regulating zebrafish ovarian function and that different isoforms of Kit and Kit ligand may have differential roles in folliculogenesis.

40|$|Objective: Assess whether {{reform in}} the Tanzanian {{medicines}} delivery system from a central 'push' <b>kit</b> <b>system</b> to a decentralized 'pull' Integrated Logistics System (ILS) has improved medicines accountability. Methods: Rufiji District in Tanzania {{was used as a}} case study. Data on medicines ordered and patients seen were compiled from routine information at six public health facilities in 1999 under the <b>kit</b> <b>system</b> and in 2009 under the ILS. Three medicines were included for comparison: an antimalarial, anthelmintic and oral rehydration salts (ORS). Results: The quality of the 2009 data was hampered by incorrect quantification calculations for orders, especially for antimalarials. Between the periods 1999 and 2009, the percent of unaccounted antimalarials fell from 60 to 18 %, while the percent of unaccounted anthelmintic medicines went from 82 to 71 %. Accounting for ORS, on the other hand, did not improve as the unaccounted amounts increased from 64 to 81 % during the same period. Conclusions: The ILS has not adequately addressed accountability concerns seen under the <b>kit</b> <b>system</b> due to a combination of governance and system-design challenges. These quantification weaknesses are likely to have contributed to the frequent periods of antimalarial stock-out experienced in Tanzania since 2009.

40|$|Abstract: The {{propagation}} of electrical trees along interfaces in epoxy resin is described. The electrical trees grew in needle-plane samples without and with internal barriers {{up to the}} final breakdown. The barrier materials glass, mica and PTFE had been chosen because they have significantly different bond mechanisms to the epoxy resin {{as well as being}} common materials in various composite high voltage insulation systems. The mechanical strength of the systems barrier material – epoxy resin was determined for the materials tested. The results show that the {{propagation of}} the tree along the barrier is dependent on the type of chemical bond and the shear strength between the epoxy resin and the barrier material. The higher the bond strength between the barrier and the epoxy the higher the resistance to electrical tree propagation. Furthermore it appears that the wettability of the barrier materials plays a minor role in tree propagation along them.

40|$|Decline in {{supplies}} of old growth wood coupled with {{increased demand for}} structural timber by the construction industry led to creation of engineered timber products (EWPs) comprising wood waste. The author designed, fabricated and tested <b>composite</b> <b>insulated</b> beams (CIBs) which are foam filled sandwich panels constructed from EWPs. CIBs in many cross-sections and materials were limit-tested for structural performance, long-term durability, thermal and dynamic behaviours. Varaiation in material properties was overcome by statistical sorting of beams with different stiffness. Some types of CIB were found to provide better structural performance than equivalent timber and glulam I-beam sections and the CIBs maintained a high strength to weight ratio. A parametric study based on Eurocode 5 determined the governing design criteria for CIBs. The study showed that in identical loading conditions CIBs offer longer spans than conventional EWP I-beams, together with lower beam depths for similar spans. Injected polyurethane foam improved long-term durability, bearing capacity and damping ratio of beams, but reduced thermal loss and reduced weakening effect of a web opening on shear strength of beams.

40|$|Finally, as {{the first}} step to study the {{regulation}} of <b>Kit</b> <b>system,</b> we found that IGF-I was a potent regulatory factor that up-regulated the expression of kitlga in zebrafish follicle cells. The stimulation involved transcription but not translation, indicating that the kitlga gene is a direct downstream target of IGF-I. The effect of IGF-I on kitlga was exerted via PI 3 K-Akt but not MAPK pathway. In contrast, the MAPK pathway may play a negative role in controlling kitlga expression. Kit ligand (also named stem cell factor, SCF) is a pleiotropic growth factor with diverse biological functions. It exerts effects on target cells by binding to its cognate tyrosine kinase receptor, Kit. In mammals, accumulated evidence has demonstrated important roles for Kit ligand and Kit in gametogenesis, melanogenesis and haematopoiesis. However, very little is known about <b>Kit</b> <b>system</b> in other vertebrates. In the present study, we used zebrafish as the model to investigate the expression, regulation and function of the <b>Kit</b> <b>system</b> in the ovary. On the other hand, cAMP is involved in regulating the expression of kitlga in zebrafish follicle cells. Two cAMP-activated effectors, PKA and Epac, have reverse effects. PKA promotes but Epac inhibits the expression of kitlga, which was identified by the respective activator. The effect of forskolin and H 89 on IGF-I-induced expression of kitlga suggests a cross-talk between the two signaling pathways. Both hCG and PACAP inhibited IGF-I-induced kitlga expression, indicating that they may have negative regulation through cAMP signaling pathways in the full-grown follicles. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) The zebrafish has two homologues of Kit ligand (kitlga and kitlgb) and Kit (kita and kitb) instead of one copy for each as in mammals. The present study proposed the origin of these homologues in the zebrafish by phylogenetic and chromosome synteny analyses, and provided further evidence for neo- or subfunctionalization for both Kit ligands and Kit receptors in the zebrafish ovary. All four <b>Kit</b> <b>system</b> members exhibited distinct and significant changes in mRNA expression during folliculogenesis, particularly in the periovulatory period before and after final oocyte maturation and ovulation. Then we further studied the spatial localization of each member within the follicle. The present study demonstrated that kitlga and kitb are exclusively expressed in the follicle layer, while kitlgb and kita only in the oocyte. Using CHO cell line as a bioreactor, we produced recombinant zebrafish Kitlga and Kitlgb. Analysis in mammalian COS- 1 cells and zebrafish primary follicle cells confirmed their biological activity and binding specifity. Two opposite paracrine pathways of <b>Kit</b> <b>system</b> in the zebrafish ovary have been shown. Kitlga from the follicle cells preferably activates Kita in the oocyte in spite of the weak response of Kitb to it. Kitlgb from the oocyte, however, exclusively activates Kitb in the follicle cells without any effects on Kita. Yao, Kai. Adviser: Ge Wei.
