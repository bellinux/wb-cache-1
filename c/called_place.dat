25|$|In 1748, the Academy of Arts {{commissioned}} a monumental {{statue of the}} king on horseback by the sculptor Bouchardon, and the Academy of Architecture was assigned to create a square, to be <b>called</b> <b>Place</b> Louis XV, where it could be erected. The site selected was the marshy open space between the Seine, the moat and bridge to the Tuileries garden, and the Champs-Élysées, {{which led to the}} Étoile, convergence of hunting trails on {{the western edge of the}} city (now Place Charles de Gaulle-Étoile). The winning plans for the square and buildings next to it were drawn by the architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel. Gabriel designed two large mansions with a street between them, Rue Royale, designed to give a clear view of the statue in the center of the square. Construction began in 1754, and the statue was put in place and dedicated on 23 February 1763. The two large mansions were still unfinished, but the façades were finished in 1765-66.|$|E
500|$|The {{front of}} the palace on Place du Château (<b>called</b> <b>Place</b> del'Évêché between 1740 and 1793), {{designed}} in a more Baroque style {{than the rest of}} the palace, is wide and curved. The central gate is framed by two pairs of columns and juts out in the shape of a Triumphal arch. The upper part of the front section is crowned with statues representing allegories of faith such as [...] "Religion" [...] and [...] "Eucharist", and personifications of Christian virtues such as [...] "Mercy" [...] and [...] "Penance". Plaster casts of some of these statues are displayed in the lapidarium inside the Barrage Vauban. The wooden portal (oak) and the walls east and west of the gate are decorated with trophies and heraldic symbols relating to the House of Rohan and the episcopal polity. The two pavilions connecting the Communs and the stable wings with the gate section are decorated with sixteen mascarons representing male and female Old Testament prophets, and with crescent-shaped pediments, in contrast to the triangular pediments of the façades. The east (left) pavilion housed the palace's kitchens while the west (right) pavilion housed the offices of the ecclesiastical court.|$|E

2500|$|Studies with rats {{have shown}} that place cells tend to fire quickly when a rat enters a new, open environment, but outside of a firing field, place cells tend to be {{relatively}} inactive. Together place cells are thought to form a [...] "cognitive map" [...] {{in which they have}} localized firing patterns <b>called</b> <b>place</b> fields. Place cell firing patterns are often determined by external sensory information and the local environment. Place cells have proven {{to have the ability to}} suddenly change their firing pattern from one pattern to another, a phenomenon known as [...] "re-mapping" [...] and though place cells do change according to the external environment, they are stabilized by attractor dynamics which [...] "enable the system to resist small changes in sensory input but respond collectively and coherently to large ones".|$|E
