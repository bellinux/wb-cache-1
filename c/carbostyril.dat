40|$|Optimum {{conditions}} for the aluminium chloride-catalysed conversion of cinnamanilide to <b>carbostyril</b> have been established and a reaction pathway for this cycloelimination is proposed. Furthermore, {{the scope of the}} reaction as a synthesis of derivatives of <b>carbostyril,</b> and subsequently of derivatives of 2 -chioroquinoline, has been examined with particular attention given to chloro- and methyl- derivatives. An improved synthesis of derivatives of 3, 4 -dihydrocarbostyril is reported and a limitation of an existing synthesis of derivatives of oxindole is noted. A qualitative determination of the products from the hydrogen chloride-catalysed rearrangement of both if- chi oro <b>carbostyril</b> and N,- 6 -di chloro <b>carbostyril</b> showed that 6 -chlorocarbostyril and 3, 6 'dichlorocarbostyril were formed from the former N-chloroamidev and 3, 6 -dichIorocarbostyril from the latter. These results are shown to be fully consistent with the 'Orton' mechanism established for the rearrangement of other if-chloro amides. The kinetics and products of the photolytic rearrangement of N-chloro-carbostyril has been investigated. Some of the results could be satisfactorily explained by analogy with the mechanisms known to operate in the rearrangement of N-chloroacetanilide. However, anomalies were found to exist connected with the unexpected ease of formation of hydrogen chloride during the photolysis of N-chlorocarbostyril. <b>Carbostyril</b> itself was found to dimerise under the conditions used to rearrange its N-chloro-derivative. Comparative studies of the photolyses of N-chlorocinnamanilide, N-chloro- 3 -phenylpropionanilide, N-chloro- 3,dihydrocarbostyril and N-chloro-if-phenyl- 3, 4 -dibydrocarbostyril were also conducted together with preliminary studied of the photolyses of N, 6 -dichiorocarbostyril and N-chloro-oxindole. A new explanation is offered of the ability of 1359213592 N-chloro- 3. 4 -dihydrocarbostyril and N-chloro- 4 -phenyl- 3,dihydro <b>carbostyril</b> to undergo dehydrochlorination on photolysis. A brief preliminary study has also been made of the benzoyl peroxide induced rearrangement of N-chlorocarbostyril in benzene. <p...|$|E

40|$|Synthesis, {{absorption}} and fluorescence spectra, {{as well as}} quantum {{yields of}} a series of donor-acceptor-substituted <b>carbostyrils</b> (quinolin- 2 (1 H) -ones), are reported. Unprecedented strong absorption maxima (e 10000 – 20000) close to the visible spectrum, large Stokes shifts up to 130 nm, and quantum yields up to 0. 7 are obtained with derivatives containing donor substituents at C(6) and C(7), and either one Ph substituent at C(3) or one CF 3 residue at C(4). For analytical applications in biochemistry and medicine, N(1) -functionalization, or amidoacylation at C(3) {{in the case of the}} CF 3 derivatives, is possible without a concomitant hypsochromic shift of their absorption and emission maxima. Semiempirical molecular-orbital calculations (AM 1 for structures, ZINDO for electronic transition energies) prove to be a suitable tool for the prediction of absorption properties of these compounds. The crystal-structure analysis of 6, 7 -dimethoxy- 1 -methyl- 3 -nitro- 4 -(trifluoromethyl) qui-nolin- 2 -(1 H) -one (7) (C 13 H 11 F 3 N 2 O 5, monoclinic, P 21 /c, a 12. 372 (2), b 12. 154 (2), c 10. 119 (2), b 112. 95 (2) 8) shows that the NO 2 group, squeezed between the CF 3 and the CO group, is oriented almost perpendicularly (87. 8 (4) 8) to the ring plane.

Upon aerobically incubating qumoline with 1 16, 000 x g supernatant of rabbit liver homogenate (Hashi-moto and Shimizu, 1959) or the fraction of super-natant precipitating at 25 - 40 % ammonium sulfate saturation (Knox, 1946), <b>carbostyril</b> is rapidly formed {{and is the only}} product which has been detected under such conditions. This ac-tivity, variously termed quinine oxidase (Kelsey and Oldham, 1943), quinoline dehydrogenase (Hashimoto and Shimizu, 1959), or aldehyde oxidase (Knox, 1946; Rajagopalan et aL, 1962), requires no additional cofactors. Upon aerobically incubating quinoline with washed rabbit liver microsomes in the presence of added or generated NADPH 2, 2 the principal products identified are 3 -quinolinol and a substance, possibly a dihy-drodiol, which is rapidly converted to 3 -quinolinol by acid; minor products, whose identification must be regarded as tentative, are 6 - and 7 -quino-linols (Mitoma et at., 1956; Posner et at., 1961). Further in vitro studies of quinoline metabolism, seeking to explain why <b>carbostyril,</b> which it syn-thesized so readily in vitro by partially purified aldehyde oxidase, has not been found in rabbit urine, and how other urinary products may have arisen by the integrated activity of microsomal and supernatant enzymes, are described in this paper.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a {{detailed study of}} the benefits of adding wavelength shifter molecules (WLS) to the heavy water of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO). Their absorption and re-emission spectra allow the conversion of ultraviolet C˘erenkov photons into longer wavelength photons, that would be more easily detected. Measurements of the optical properties of five candidates show that only two of them, Alexa Fluor and <b>Carbostyril,</b> are suitable. The analysis indicates that WLS would increase the number of detected photons, lead to more uniform distributions for the reconstructed position and energy, allow a larger fiducial volume and a lower energy threshold for the study of solar neutrinos. The goal is to determine whether adding WLS to SNO will allow a direct measurement of matter induced neutrino oscillations. Finally, a cosmic ray telescope has been developed and shows promising results for an independent measurement of the optical properties of WLS...|$|E

The duration of action of CHF 4226. 01 in antagonizing the airway obstruction elicited by AcCHO was also substantially longer than formoterol (area under the curve) at 10 [*]pmol, 763 ± 58 and 480 ± 34, respectively; P< 0. 01). Continuous infusion of a subthreshold dose of AcCHO enhanced the intratracheal pressure (ITP) increases caused by subsequent challenges with substance P (from 9. 7 ± 0. 8 to 27. 5 ± 1. 6 [*]cm H 2 O as a peak, P< 0. 001). Pretreatment with either CHF 4226. 01 or formoterol prevented the sensitizing effect of AcCHO on substance P responses (ED 50 values, 2. 85 and 6. 11 [*]pmol, respectively; P< 0. 01). The ED 50 value of budesonide (396 [*]nmol) in preventing AcCHO-evoked ITP increase was reduced when this glucocorticoid was combined with 0. 1 [*]pmol CHF 4226. 01 (ED 50 76 [*]nmol; P< 0. 001).

40|$|Objective(s) : Recently, {{we showed}} that some new {{synthetic}} compounds structurally related to cilostamide (4 -(1, 2 -dihydro- 2 -oxoquinolin- 6 -hydroxy) - N-cyclohexyl-N-methylbutanamide), a selective phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE 3) inhibitor, produce inotropic effect {{comparable to that of}} IBMX (3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine), a non-selective PDE inhibitor, but with differential chronotropic effect. In this investigation, we compared the pharmacological effects of these compounds as potential cardiotonic agents using the spontaneously beating atria model. Materials and Methods: In each experiment, rats were treated with reserpine.   The atrium was isolated and mounted in an organ bath. We assessed chronotropic and inotropic effects using cumulativelogconcentration-response curves of isoprenaline alone or in combination of each test-compound. Results: Majority of test compounds augment atria contraction force (ACF) significantly but with different potencies on atrium contraction rate. Cilostamide, MCPIP ([4 -(4 -methyl piperazin- 1 -yl) - 4 -oxobutoxy) - 4 -methylquinolin- 2 (1 H) -one]), methyl <b>carbostyril</b> compounds- (mc 1), mc 2 and mc 5 increased the isoprenaline effect on ACF synergistically. But, mc 6 failed to potentiate the effect of isoprenalin; mc 3 and mc 4 did not increase ACF, which may be because of their higher hydrophilic nature. It was interesting that mc 2, alone or in combination with isoprenaline, produced the highest inotropic effect while it did not affect the basal contraction rate and almost blocked the isoprenaline chronotropic effect. Conclusion: Combination of mc 2 with isoprenaline had synergistic effect on inotropic effect, but this combination reduced isoprenaline chronotropic effect; therefore, these effects cannot be related to reducing B-adrenergic receptors activity. These compounds showed different effects; probably all of them were not mediated via PDE 3 inhibition and other mechanisms are involving...|$|E
