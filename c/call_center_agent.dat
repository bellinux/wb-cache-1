In order to analyze the data, the writer uses descriptive quantitative and sociolinguistics approach. In this study, the writer {{is trying to figure}} out the differences between male and female <b>call</b> <b>center</b> <b>agents</b> in using apology strategies responding to the customers? complaints. Furthermore, the writer also describes the possible factors that underlie the differences. Then she also determines whether conversations between the same and opposite sex influenced the use of apology strategies. Hence, the data are taken from the real conversation between <b>call</b> <b>center</b> <b>agents</b> and the customers. To interpret the findings, the writer classified the conversations based on gender differences and analyze them using Anna Trosborg?s theory of apology strategies. From the interpretation and conclusion of the analysis show that all strategies formulated by Trosborg appear in the responses of female <b>call</b> <b>center</b> <b>agents.</b> It indicates that female tend to be more cooperative in explaining the problem than male. Moreover, male agents prefer to use Strategy 8 ? Offer of repair to compensate the damage than Strategy 6 ? Concern for hearer to show concern for male complainers. Yet the male <b>call</b> <b>center</b> <b>agents</b> would not also hesitate using Strategy 6 ? Concern for hearer to show concern and Strategy 3 ? Explanation or account to give further explanations towards female customers. While male <b>call</b> <b>center</b> <b>agents</b> only produce fewer utterances, female <b>call</b> <b>center</b> <b>agents</b> prefer to use Strategy 3 ? Explanation or account as much as Strategy 2 ? Minimizing towards both male and female customers.
