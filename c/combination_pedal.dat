40|$|This exegetical {{critique}} makes {{a conceptual}} summation of Ronald Stevenson’s life’s {{work for the}} piano and his contributions as a composer‐pianist. Chapters one and two provide a profile of Stevenson as a pianist, examining the aesthetic and musical concerns that defined his long career, as well as precedents and antecedents of his pianism. Of particular interest are the ways that Stevenson coalesces aspects of the ‘grand manner’ and his obsession with a pianistic bel canto style. Chapter three examines Stevenson’s remarkable output in terms of piano transcriptions. His conceptualization of this as ‘capturing the essence’ of the original composer is used to mount a defense of this erstwhile unfashionable genre, examining the ways that Stevenson’s output blurs the line between transcription and composition. Chapter four offers a detailed examination {{of the art of}} pedalling in Stevenson’s own work, particularly the use of the sostenuto pedal, and the ways that he exploited more complex forms of <b>combination</b> <b>pedalling</b> in his compositions and transcriptions. Chapter five examines the ways that Stevenson’s works abound with socio‐political referencing and historical allusions, with particular attention to the Passacaglia on DSCH—a work that constituted such a political provocative act that it resulted in a police raid. Chapter six further interrogates aspects of the Passacaglia, its embodiment of the miniature and the monumental, and the ways that it personifies the culmination and summation of Stevenson as both a pianist and composer...|$|R

So when I came into producing 'Relax' I made sure that most of the sounds we used were actually made by real instruments. We used some great session musicians who had worked with Quincy Jones and Michael Jackson. And we picked up the strangest <b>pedal</b> <b>combinations</b> to get all these weird sounds. It's really effective - you can't tell if it's a full dance track or really laid-back. It feels a bit weird electronically. The organic-ness gives a more classic field to it. So it was one of the harder tracks for me to produce, but also the most rewarding." ...|$|R
50|$|Pedersen {{wrote that}} he {{developed}} the hammock style seat first. It provides suspension from road imperfections with much less weight, 4 oz instead of 3 lb of traditional leather and steel spring saddles of the day. Pedersen then developed a frame, a truss assembled from several thin tubes, around his new seat design. He attributed his inspiration to the Whipple-Murphy bridge truss. The design initially did not support seat height adjustment, and even after some adjustability was added, required the manufacture of eight different sizes. The non-standard frame design would not accommodate a traditional front fork. Instead, Pedersen developed a fork that also consisted of thin tubes assembled into a truss, which {{was attached to the}} frame with bearings at two distinct points, instead of through a traditional head tube. Pedersen also received patents for a chainwheel and bottom bracket <b>combination</b> and lightweight <b>pedals.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Wickham has {{experimented with}} a {{technique}} he calls [...] "fuzz fiddle", partially inspired by rock fiddler Warren Ellis and {{the genre of}} grunge music. Wickham's first attempt at a distorted rock fiddle sound was with a band named Juggler, which existed between 1978 and 1981. Wickham fed his fiddle through a guitar distortion pedal, but disliked the amount of feedback {{and the fact that}} it [...] "was very difficult to control". While attending a Nick Cave concert with Scott, Wickham observed Ellis use a fiddle with a fuzz pedal successfully. Wickham, after experimenting with some combinations, settled upon an amplifier, fiddle and <b>pedal</b> <b>combination</b> he was pleased with, [...] "and the fuzz-fiddle was reborn". Wickham has used the technique for The Waterboys song [...] "Is She Conscious?", a cover of Bruce Springsteen's [...] "Independence Day" [...] and, in a nod to Jimi Hendrix's version of [...] "The Star Spangled Banner", has also used it in a performance of [...] "Amhrán na bhFiann".|$|R
40|$|Throughout the piano’s history, certain composers {{have created}} {{innovations}} {{in the areas}} of virtuosity and sonority. These innovations came not only from the composers’ imagination, but also from the development of instruments and changes in musical style from one period to another. To investigate what kinds of innovations these pianist composers made, I divided them into technique and sound from Mozart to Cowell. I chose two-piano music (Sonata in D major, K. 448 by Mozart and Rachmaninoff’s Second Suite) to demonstrate their experiments with varieties of textures and sonorities, using different registers of the two pianos orchestrally. En Blanc et noir by Debussy shows this composer’s deep interest and originality in piano sonorities. For solo piano music, Beethoven’s Piano Sonata Op. 53 shows extensive technical invention. His use of long pedal effects shows a pianistic possibility not explored by Mozart. Hummel’s Piano Sonata in D major represents orchestral devices as well as pianistic techniques showing recent developments in the instrument. Chopin’s Ballade No. 3 and Scherzo No. 3 show virtuosic moments and also the expanded range of the keyboard. His Nocturne Op. 27, no. 2, with its sonorities resulting from the <b>combination</b> of <b>pedal,</b> and widespread accompaniments derived from Alberti bass figures, {{is a perfect example of}} Chopin’s characteristic sound-world. “Vallée d’Obermann” by Liszt uses many virtuosic techniques as well as the extreme wide ranges of keyboard in both hands to create dramatic contrasts of texture. Debussy’s etude, “Pour les Sonorités opposés” is probably the first etude designed for sonority rather than for keyboard virtuosity. Albeniz’s “Evocación” and “Triana” show Spanish atmosphere. Prokofiev’s Sonata no. 3 shows frequent motoric driving elements that demand percussive virtuosity. Cowell’s piano music is some of the earliest to explore the sonorities of tone clusters and playing on the strings. This performance dissertation consists of three recitals performed in the Orchestra Room, Leah Smith Hall, and Gildenhorn Recital Hall at the University of Maryland, College Park. These recitals are documented on compact disc recordings that are housed within the University of Maryland Library System...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of a microscopic traffic simulation study conducted to investigate the impact of a Congestion Assistant on traffic efficiency and traffic safety. The Congestion Assistant is an in-vehicle system in which an active pedal supports the driver when approaching congestion and a stop-and-go function when driving in congestion. The authors used an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) Modeller traffic flow simulation tool to study the effect of the Congestion Assistantin congestion caused by a lane drop. This article describes (a) how the Congestion Assistant operates and (b) the main features of the ITS Modeller. Furthermore, it examines the calibration and validation of the ITS Modeller for congestion caused by a lane drop using traffic flow measurements on a segment of the Dutch A 12 highway. Simulation experiments of different penetration rates and system settings show that the stop and go leads to a 30 % decrease in travel-time delay at a 10 % penetration rate, while the active pedal leads to small reductions in travel-time delay. Compared with the stop-and-go function, the active pedal has fewer sharp accelerations and decelerations, which implies better traffic safety and driver comfort. The effect of the stop-and-go active <b>pedal</b> <b>combination</b> {{is similar to that of}} the stop-and-go function on its own. The authors further discuss the implications of the results...|$|R
5000|$|A multi-effects device (also {{called a}} [...] "multi-FX" [...] device) {{is a single}} {{electronics}} effects pedal or rack-mount device that contains many electronic effects. In the late 1990s and throughout the 2000s, multi-FX manufacturers such as Zoom and Korg produced devices that were increasingly feature-laden. Multi-FX devices combine several effects together, and most devices allow users to use preset combinations of effects, including distortion, chorus, reverb, compression, and so on. This allows musicians to have quick on-stage access to different effects <b>combinations.</b> Some multi-FX <b>pedals</b> contain modelled versions of well-known effects pedals or amplifiers.Multi-effects devices have garnered {{a large share of}} the effects device market, because they offer the user such a large variety of effects in a single package. A low-priced multi-effects pedal may provide 20 or more effects {{for the price of a}} regular single-effect pedal. More expensive multi-effect pedals may include 40 or more effects, amplifier modelling, and the ability to combine effects and/or modelled amp sounds in different combinations, as if the user was using multiple guitar amps. More expensive multi-effects pedals may also include more input and output jacks (e.g., an auxiliary input or a [...] "dry" [...] output), MIDI inputs and outputs, and an expression pedal, which can control volume or modify effect parameters (e.g., the rate of the simulated rotary speaker effect).|$|R

Influence of priming {{exercise}} on pulmonary O 2 uptake kinetics during transitions to high-intensity exercise at extreme pedal rates. Journal of Applied Physiology, 106 (2), 432 - 442. We investigated the pedal rate dependency {{of the effect}} of priming {{exercise on}} pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO 2) kinetics. Seven healthy men completed two, 6 -min bouts of high-intensity cycle exercise (separated by 6 min of rest) using different <b>combinations</b> of extreme <b>pedal</b> rates for the priming and criterion exercise bouts (i. e., 35 - 35, 35 - 115, 115 - 35, and 115 - 115 rev/min). Pulmonary gas exchange and heart rate were measured breath-by-breath, and muscle oxygenation was assessed using near-infrared spectroscopy. When the priming bout was performed at 35 rev/min (35 - 35 and 35 - 115 conditions), the phase II VO 2 time constant (tau) was not significantly altered (bout 1 : 31 ? 7 vs. bout 2 : 30 ? 5 s and bout 1 : 48 ? 16 vs. bout 2 : 46 ? 21 s, respectively). However, when the priming bout was performed at 115 rev/min (115 - 35 and 115 - 115 conditions), the phase II tau was significantly reduced (bout 1 : 31 ? 7 vs. bout 2 : 26 ? 5 s and bout 1 : 48 ? 16 vs. bout 2 : 39 ? 9 s, respectively, P < 0. 05). Muscle oxygenation was significantly higher after priming exercise in all four conditions, but significant effects on VO 2 kinetics were only evident when muscle O 2 extraction (measured as delta[deoxyhemoglobin]/delta VO 2) was elevated in the fundamental response phase. These data indicate that prior high-intensity exercise at a high pedal rate can speed VO 2 kinetics during subsequent high-intensity exercise, presumably through specific priming effects on type II muscle fibers.

5000|$|Unlike Rubinstein, Hofmann {{sat quietly}} at the piano, {{striking}} {{the keys in}} a kneading manner. His finger staccato {{was at the time}} unequaled, as was his orchestral sonority. According to his student Nadia Reisenberg, he continuously used a <b>combination</b> of finger <b>pedalling</b> and foot pedalling. The New York Times critic Harold C. Schonberg said Hofmann had all of Leopold Godowsky's technique, a claim approved by Godowsky himself. By his own admission, Sergei Rachmaninoff, in his 40s, prepared for a career as a concert pianist by practicing over 15 hours a day with the goal of attaining the level of Hofmann's technique. When pianist Ralph Berkowitz was asked if Vladimir Horowitz had the greatest technique of all the pianists he had heard, Berkowitz replied that Horowitz indeed was the supreme master of the technical parts of performance, but one older era pianist was his equal - Hofmann. [...] Hofmann's approach and style can be summarized by his motto [...] "an aristocrat never hurries". [...] He often stated that Rubinstein and Moriz Rosenthal were the only pianists that influenced his art, and admired singers Mattia Battistini and Marcella Sembrich (see [...] and [...] ). He adopted a more demonstrative style in live performances but a subtle and restrained style for his studio recordings; in both cases, he mostly adhered to the printed score, occasionally doubling left-hand octaves, and shunned sentimentality. He put spontaneity rather than structure foremost and admitted to Rachmaninoff that [...] "I {{do not know how to}} build a composition ... occasionally, it happens to sound well". Schonberg wrote that among Hofmann's contemporaries, only Godowsky had the finish and refinement of Hofmann but lacked Hofmann's color, fire, and [...] "red blood", while only Ferruccio Busoni and Rachmaninoff were ever mentioned by contemporaries as Hofmann's equals. After hearing a performance of Chopin's B minor Sonata by Hofmann, Rachmaninoff cut that piece from his own repertoire saying [...] "not since Anton Rubinstein have I heard such titanic playing".|$|R
40|$|On a treadmill, {{intensity}} is determined when a runner sets {{the speed of}} the belt. The runner must then find a combination of stride rate and length that will equal the belt speed. When using a cycle ergometer nothing forces a rider to find a <b>combination</b> of <b>pedaling</b> rate and force on the pedal to match a set intensity. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the ability of trained individuals to match the intensity of cycling on a stationary cycle ergometer with the intensity of running on a treadmill. METHODS: Seven participants (3 female, 4 male) who regularly run for fitness ran on a treadmill for 2 miles at a self-selected pace (mean = 3. 18 ± 0. 17 m/s). Then each participant rode the same course on the stationary ergometer with the goal to match the intensity of the run. For the two activities, expired gases, heart rate (HR) and EMG (right leg: gluteus maximus, GMAX, lateral vastus, VAST, hamstrings, HAMS, and gastrocnemius, GAST) were collected. Integrated EMG (mV*s) was calculated to determine muscle activation. Two tailed t-tests were used to quantify the difference between variables of the two trials and correlations were calculated to determine relationships of muscle activity to performance and metabolic data. RESULTS: The average pedaling rate and step frequency, HR, and ventilatory rate (VE) were not statistically different between running and cycling, although HR and VE were lower in cycling (HR mean= 7 bpm, VE mean= 6 L/min). Average oxygen consumption, energy expenditure, METS and breaths per minute were significantly greater during running (mean = 2. 89 L/min, 41. 37 ml/kg/min, 13. 57 kcal/min, 11. 82 METS, 40. 70 bpm) than cycling (mean = 2. 51 L/min, 35. 89 ml/kg/min, 11. 62 kcal/min, 10. 25 METS, 33. 79 bpm) (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Total muscle activity during running was two times greater than cycling (p = 0. 00) and each of the muscles were activated more in running (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). In running, GAST (r= 0. 83, p = 0. 02) and HAMS (r= 0. 90, p= 0. 01) contributed most to total muscle activity, QUAD (r= 0. 97, p= 0. 00) and GAST (r= 0. 82, p= 0. 03) were highly correlated to speed, and QUAD (r= 0. 78, p= 0. 04) was highly correlated with caloric expenditure and oxygen consumption. In cycling, all muscles related similarly to the total muscle activity, speed, caloric expenditure and oxygen consumption, thus muscle activity was shared by the four muscles. CONCLUSION: Based on metabolic data, this group was unable to match the intensity of pedaling with that of their self-selected running pace. Interestingly, they had very similar stride (mean = 79. 1 /min) and pedaling (mean = 78. 3 /min) rates. When asked to match intensities, these participants naturally selected a resistance on the bike that would permit them to pedal at the same frequency as running, but the resistance was not sufficient to produce enough power to match the intensity. Two participants are regular cyclists and they were better able to match intensities. For those two, for example, caloric expenditure was only 0. 42 kcal/min less on the bike, while the other five averaged 2. 03 kcal/min less. The majority of the participants lacked experience on the bike which may be why they were unable to freely match the two intensities. The mismatch of intensity has implications on fitness and injury recovery. The two muscle patterns and task demands are so different, that it is necessary for people to be familiar with the effect of resistance on the bike and not just match leg movement rates if the same {{intensity is}} desired for acquiring or maintaining fitness...|$|R
