40|$|Service {{contracting}} {{has been}} adopted in several industries especially for high value assets with long life time. Such a <b>contract</b> typically specifies <b>asset</b> usage information, availability or capability of the <b>contracted</b> <b>assets</b> required by customers, and the scope of services the manufacturers are obliged to support the assets. Consequently, such a contract imposes major risks to the manufacturers. This paper aims to explore approaches that be used to assist manufacturers to model service contracts {{in order to understand}} the risk and reward prior to committing a contract with customer. The work described in the paper involves the development of a simulation model from a case of the ship building industry. The use of the model in aiding contracting decisions is demonstrated through three experiments conducted at the case company.

The result is consistent across both quantity (sophisticated bidders win more market share) and price (sophisticated bidders pay lower premiums).

40|$|Solid waste {{management}} services are contracted out to private firms in many U. S. communities. Household waste collection, transport, and disposal are relatively straightforward services to define within {{the terms of}} a contract. The addition of recycling, however, significantly complicates matters. How should contracts be structured to provide incentives for recycling? Who should own key facilities, such as recyclable materials processing facilities? Should a separate contract for processing and sale of materials be used, or should these services be provided by government employees or purely private markets? These questions are addressed in this study using the principal-agent framework and the theory of incomplete contracts in economics. I explain stylized facts in the industry, including facts about asset ownership, and look in detail at contracts used in seven communities that have achieved high rates of waste diversion and recycling. incentive <b>contracts,</b> <b>asset</b> specificity, principal-agent models, waste collection, recycling...|$|R

40|$|A point {{repeatedly}} {{stressed by}} transaction cost economics {{is that the}} more specific the asset, the more likely is vertical integration to be optimal. In spite of the profusion of empirical papers supporting this prediction, recent surveys and casual observation suggest that higher levels of asset specificity need not always lead to vertical integration. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to uncover some of the factors driving firms to (sometimes) choose to remain separated, rather than integrate, in the presence of high specificity. Its main economic message is that in a world where outside options matter and investments are multidimensional, high levels of asset specificity can foster nonintegration: a low level of specificity provides the most misdirected incentives when transacting in a market (because the outside option of external trade becomes so tempting), thus making a stronger case for nonintegration when specificity is high. relational <b>contracts,</b> <b>asset</b> specificity, property rights, vertical integration, outsourcing...|$|R

Consistent with the view that personal institutions govern transactions in China, our analysis of 361 buyer-supplier exchanges indicates that managers rely more on relational ties as asset specificity and uncertainty increase. We also find some support that impersonal institutions govern market transactions: as uncertainty increases, managers craft more customized contracts. Surprisingly, there is no association between <b>contracts</b> and <b>asset</b> specificity.

40|$|We {{live in a}} world {{permeated}} with technology. Through our online accounts {{we write}} emails, we store pictures, videos, and documents, we pay bills and conduct financial transactions, we buy digital books and music, and we manage loyalty programs. Digital assets have quickly replaced physical letters, pictures, books, compact discs, and documents stored in filing cabinets and shoeboxes. The emergence of digital assets raises pressing questions regarding the treatment of digital assets at an account holder’s death. Unlike digital assets’ physical counterparts, an account holder does not control the ultimate fate of digital assets. Instead, digital assets are controlled by a private contract entered into by an account holder and a company that provides services or digital products. This Article explores the growing conflict between traditional succession practices and digital asset succession, which is controlled by digital <b>asset</b> <b>contracts.</b> It begins by tracing the development of private contracts as a method of transferring assets at death and shows that although contracts are regularly used to transfer assets at death, digital <b>asset</b> <b>contracts</b> have taken an unprecedented step of prohibiting or severely limiting the transfer of assets at death. This Article next explores the prevalence of digital assets and explains how service providers address digital asset inheritance in private contracts. It argues that digital <b>asset</b> <b>contracts</b> that deny inheritance may be validly formed but should be void as a matter of public policy because they transfer decision-making power about assets from an individual account holder to corporations. As our control over the ultimate fate of our digital assets diminishes, the nature of our property interests in digital assets also shifts away from our traditional understanding of ownership of personal property. It argues that we should take a conscious approach to reforming succession law based on time-honored principles of American succession law that benefit society as a whole and not allow private <b>contracts</b> controlling digital <b>assets</b> to hijack our system of inheritance. This Article concludes by offering suggestions for reform and action before the ability to transfer and preserve digital assets falls beyond our reach...|$|R
