2500|$|Criterion {{also promised}} updates to add new {{features}} {{in addition to}} bug fixes for the PC version. The first update for the PC was released on 26 November 2010 which addressed crashes, issues with aspect ratios, and missing effects. D-Box motion <b>chair</b> <b>support</b> was also added. The second update for the PC was released on 19 January 2011, which fixed issues with flickering graphics, controller configurations, steering response, player car engine audio volume, CPU performance and rare crash issue when entering the Career map screen. The three free cars from the One Million Challenge was also added. The third update for the PC was released on 17 March 2011, which fixed several issues players were having relating to game crashes and bugs. The fourth update for PC was released on 4 April 2011, which stamped out another 30 percent of the game's known bugs, {{with a total of}} 77 percent of the issues fixed. The fifth update for PC was released on 14 April 2011, as with the most recent patch this new update is mainly to deal with various game crash issues which players have encountered while playing the game. One game crash in particular, which occurred on some systems when players were prompted to [...] "Press Any Key", has been fixed in this patch. EA announced that PC version of the game would not receive downloadable content. Criterion confirmed this on their official message boards; [...] "We have a limited amount of resources that makes it so that we are unable to deliver new content to all platforms, however we do have more updates and content on the way for PC players." ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Determining the {{influence}} of the position of the arm on blood pressure measurement in the sitting position. METHODS: Blood pressure of 128 individuals (the majority being treated hypertensive patients) visiting the outpatient clinic was measured simultaneously on both arms with arms in two different positions. First, both arms were placed at the <b>chair</b> <b>support</b> level and blood pressure was measured three times on both arms after 10 min of rest. Subsequently, while still remaining in the same sitting position, five blood pressure measurements were made simultaneously at both arms with one arm placed on the desk and one arm placed and supported at heart level (mid-sternal). The arm placed at heart level served as the reference arm. The choice of which arm was placed at desk level and which arm was placed at heart level was randomized. RESULTS: Both at desk level and at <b>chair</b> <b>support</b> level, mean (+/-SD) systolic and diastolic blood pressures were higher than blood pressure at heart level by 6. 1 / 5. 7 +/- 4. 6 / 3. 1 and 9. 3 / 9. 4 +/- 5. 4 / 3. 4 mmHg, respectively. The effect of the height differences between the arm positions on the blood pressure readings was smaller than predicted (0. 49 mmHg/cm systolic and 0. 47 mmHg/cm diastolic). No significant correlation was found between blood pressure difference in the different arm positions (desk and heart level) and age, sex, weight or baseline blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Different arm positions below heart level have significant effects on blood pressure readings. The leading guidelines about arm position during blood pressure measurement are not in accordance with the arm position used in the Framingham study, the most frequently used study for risk estimations...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} workplace correlates (departmental and college) of scholarly performance in 296 {{college faculty members}} from 67 schools of pharmacy in the United States. The study estimated a model of 3 -year scholarly performance through the exploration of six sets of correlates: demographic; affiliation; collaboration; research experiences and orientation; department; and college variables. Data obtained through self-reports shows that approiimately {{one quarter of the}} respondents had published no refereed articles and the average faculty member published slightly over one article per year in the last 3 years; a finding not much different than other faculty populations, yet still slightly under national averages. Positive correlates of scholarly performance by pharmacy faculty were shown to be time spent in research and in collaboration with colleagues. However, department <b>chair</b> <b>support...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we have {{explored}} {{different aspects of}} blood pressure measurement and related it {{to the risk of}} cardiovascular disease. In the first part we showed that when the arm is positioned under heart level, for example when the arm is placed on a desk or a <b>chair</b> <b>support,</b> the blood pressure and the cardiovascular risk is overstimated. We demonstrated that crossing the legs {{at the level of the}} knee, but not at the level of the ankle, causes a rise of blood pressure. We proved that the physiological mechanism causing the blood pressure rise was a rise in stroke volume and cardiac output. In the second part, we have investigated the separate contribution of the hospital environment and the presence of the physician on the white coat effect (a higher blood pressure at home, than in the hospital in the presence of a doctor). We concluded that the hospital environment had a larger influence on the white coat effect than the presence of a physician. We also reviewed the present literature regarding diagnostic and therapeutic thresholds of the self-measured blood pressure at home and proposed new cut-off values for optimal, normal and high cardiovascular risk. In the third and last part we reviewed and explored a new index for arterial stiffness (the ambulatory arterial stiffness index, AASI). Arterial stiffness marks the ageing of arteries and is a precursor and marker of cardiovascular disease. The AASI is determined by simple 24 -hour blood pressure monitoring. We studied the reproducibility of the AASI and concluded that is was as reproducible as other ambulatory markers of cardiovascular risk. We have set quality criteria for the AASI and demonstrated that this new index is ready to be used in cardiovascular risk stratification on a large scale...|$|E

40|$|Teacher-student {{relationships}} are {{a critical component}} to every classroom. Little is known about how department <b>chairs</b> <b>support</b> these relationships. Department chairs provide a special and underrepresented perspective, as they are often still teachers with administrative knowledge and responsibilities. This qualitative study investigated ten department chairs' beliefs about the teacher-student relationship and their role in supporting this relationship. Participants were from five content areas (science, social studies, English, special education, and career and technical education) in four public high school districts in Massachusetts and New York. Data were collected through two sixty-minute semi-structured interviews and one day of "shadowing" with each department chair. Analyses show that department chairs expect teachers to instruct from an ethic of care by enacting three relationship development behaviors: establishing relationship boundaries, knowing students as people and as learners, and building a safe and dependable environment. These department <b>chairs</b> <b>supported</b> teachers' relationship development with students primarily through modeling these same behaviors in their relationships with teachers. Department chairs' own experiences with developing relationships with students informed how they developed supervisory relationships with teachers, and they claimed this positively influenced teacher practice. However, when faced with resistant teachers and time constraints, department chairs' ability to apply their expertise as caring and effective educators was severely limited, resulting in dysfunctional supervisory relationships and limited teacher growth. Department chairs {{are in need of}} professional development targeted to their special situation, especially as it relates to their ability to influence the learning experiences of teachers and students...|$|R

50|$|A {{cantilever}} {{chair is}} a chair whose seating and framework are {{not supported by}} the typical arrangement of 4 legs, but instead is held erect and aloft by a single leg or legs that are attached to one end of a chair's seat and bent in an L shape, thus also serving as the <b>chair's</b> <b>supporting</b> base. Nearly a century after its inception, tubular steel remains the prime choice for the cantilever chair with Marcel Breuer being perhaps the greatest champion of this design technique; using the overhanging cantilever styling in both his furniture and architecture. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Alvar Aalto are other historical figures who contributed to the popularity of the cantilever chair.|$|R
