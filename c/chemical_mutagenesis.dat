40|$|An RNA editing {{reaction}} {{that is both}} essential and specific to the trypanosomatid parasites is an attractive target for new drug development. Although high-throughput screening of chemical libraries is a powerful strategy often used to identify new drugs, the available in vitro editing assays {{do not have the}} necessary sensitivity and format for this approach to be feasible. A ruthenium labeled reporter RNA is described here that overcomes these limitations as it can both detect edited product in the low femtomole range and is ideal for high-throughput format. The reporter RNA consists of an RNA editing substrate linked to a streptavidin-binding aptamer that is initially held within an inactive conformation. An in vitro selection strategy optimized the linkage so that the streptavidin-binding aptamer is only activated by an editing-induced conformational change. An electrochemiluminescent signal results from the ruthenium label when the reporter is bound to the bottom of a streptavidin-coated microtiter plate where it can be stimulated by a carbon electrode. <b>Chemical</b> probing, <b>mutagenesis,</b> and binding affinity measurements were used to characterize the reporter.

40|$|Using <b>chemical</b> germ-line <b>mutagenesis,</b> we {{screened}} mice for {{defects in}} the {{humoral immune response}} to a type II T-independent immunogen and an experimental alphavirus vector. A total of 26 mutations that impair humoral immunity were recovered, and 19 of these mutations have been positionally cloned. Among the phenovariants were bumble, cellophane, and Worker ascribed to mutations in Nfkbid, Zeb 1, and Ruvbl 2, respectively. We show that IκBNS, the nuclear IκB-like protein encoded by Nfkbid, {{is required for the}} development of marginal zone and peritoneal B- 1 B cells and additionally required for extrafollicular antibody responses to T-independent and -dependent immunogens. Zeb 1 is also required for marginal zone and peritoneal B- 1 B-cell development as well as T-cell development, germinal center formation, and memory B-cell responses. Finally, Ruvbl 2 is required for T-cell development and maximal T-dependent antibody responses. Collectively, the mutations that we identified give us insight into the points at which disruption of an antibody response can occur.

50|$|In mice, <b>chemical</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> is a phenotype-driven {{approach}} {{to map the}} mouse mutant catalogue. The usage of mice in behavioural mutation tests allows scientists to increase {{our understanding of the}} genetic basis of mammalian behaviour as well as applying this information to human neurological disorders and psychiatric disorders. SHIRPA is a hierarchal screening protocol that efficiently searches for mutations in muscle and lower motor neuron function, Spinocerebellar,|sensory neuron function, neuropsychiatry function, and autonomic nervous system function. The mice are then further tested for defects in parameters that are associated with human psychiatric disorders by using two well-known behaviour tests. The mice are tested for locomotor activity (LMA) as well as prepulse inhibition (PPI). For LMA, mice are placed in cages with beam-splitting monitors that will measure the activity of the mice as well as calculate their habituation to that environment. LMA is recorded in 35-minute time spans in bins of a 5-minute duration. The PPI measures the acoustic startle response, which is an exaggerated response to an unexpected stimulus. The acoustic startle is measured over a range of frequencies and amplitudes to calculate the average response. These tests allow us to detect abnormal behaviours and document them.|$|E
50|$|Coprinopsis cinerea can be {{transformed}} with exogenous DNA by transformation when the fungus is a protoplast. It was found that disrupting (knockout or RNAi silencing) ku70 homologue can increase gene targeting via increased homologous recombination. Either protoplasts derived from oidia or vegetative mycelium can be used, however, gene targeting {{was found to be}} higher by 2% (based on phenotyping) when using vegetative mycelium. Otherwise, insertion of integrative vectors ectopically and with small homologous regions can be used, likely with low transformation efficiency. Earlier, REMI (restriction enzyme-mediated integration) could be used to insert exogenous DNA into the chromosome to produce mutant strains. This relies on inserting exogenous DNA and restriction enzymes into the protoplast cell, allowing for the enzymes to cut the chromosome at specific sites which match those sites used to produce linearized plasmid DNA with the gene of interest; subsequently, host enzymes ligate the cut sites and thus produce integrated heterologous, exogenous DNA. Although successful, undesirable mutations are likely. <b>Chemical</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> (also random) can also be done. Phenotype selection of the inability to fruit can indict that insertion led to disruption of vital genes. All in all, homologous recombination provides more specificity when creating a mutant strain. Depending on the mutant, auxotrophy markers (requires lost gene to be inserted) or prototrophy (when causing essential gene deletion) be used for selection.|$|E
5000|$|Until the {{commercial}} development of mobile DNA technology in 2007 and zinc-finger nuclease technology in 2009, {{there were only}} two technologies {{that could be used to}} produce rat models of human disease: cloning and <b>chemical</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). Although cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) could theoretically be used to create rats with specific mutations by mutating somatic cells, and then using these cells for SCNT, this approach has not been used successfully to create knockout rats. One problem with this strategy is that SCNT is extremely inefficient. The first published attempt had a success rate of less than 1%. Alternatively, ENU mutagenesis is a common random mutagenesis gene knockout strategy in the mouse that can also be used in the rat. ENU mutagenesis involves using a chemical, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), to create single base changes in the genome. ENU transfers its ethyl group to oxygen or nitrogen radicals in DNA, resulting in mis-pairing and base pair substitution. Mutant animals can be produced by injecting a male mouse with ENU, and breeding with a wild type female to produce mutant offspring. ENU mutagenesis creates a high frequency of random mutations, with approximately one base pair change in any given gene in every 200-700 gametes. Despite its high mutagenicity, the physical penetration of ENU is limited and only about 500 genes are mutated for each male and a very small number of the total mutations have an observable phenotype. Thousands of mutations typically need to be created in a single animal in order to generate one novel phenotype.|$|E

The ear gene product is present in all early embryonic cells, but becomes restricted to specific tissues in late embryogenesis. We mapped the ear gene to cytological region 88 E 11 - 13, near easter, and showed that it is deleted by Df(3 R) ea(5022 rx 1), a small, cytologically invisible deletion. Annotation of the completed Drosophila genome sequence suggests that this region might contain as many as 26 genes, most of which, including ear, are not represented by mutant alleles.

Crystallographic analyses have shown that Lys 329 is the apical residue in a 12 -residue flexible loop (loop 6) of the {Beta},{alpha}-barrel domain of the active site and that Glu 48 resides {{at the end of}} helix B of the N-terminal domain of the active site. When phosphorylated ligands are bound by the enzyme, loop 6 adopts a closed conformation and, in concert with repositioning of helix B, thereby occludes the active site from the external environment. In this closed conformation, the {gamma}-carboxylate of Glu 48 and the {epsilon}-amino group of Lys 329 engage in intersubunit electrostatic interaction. By use of appropriate site-directed mutants of Rhodospirillum rubrum Rubisco, we are addressing several issues: the catalytic roles of Lys 329 and Glu 48, the functional significance of the intersubunit salt bridge comprised of these two residues, and the roles of loop 6 and helix B in stabilizing labile reaction intermediates.
