These results are consistent with the hypothesis that blockade of the ICAM- 1 :lymphocyte function-associated 1 pathway results in immunosuppression, whereas blockade of the B 7 :CD 28 /CTLA 4 pathway results in alloantigen-specific anergy.

[...] Immunosuppressive drugs are used to suppress the immune response, but the effect is not specific. Therefore, organism can be affected by the infection or cancer much more easily. The goal of the future therapies is to suppress the alloimmune response specifically to prevent these risks.The tolerance could be achieved by elimination of most or all alloreactive T cells and by influencing alloreactive effector-regulatory T-lymphocytes ratio in favor of regulatory cells which could inhibit alloreactive effector cells.

Addition of a second antibody (Ab) to further cross-link the TCR substantially increased the level of adhesion and also activated degranulation, as measured by release of serine esterase, {{in the presence of}} immobilized FN but not in its absence. Thus, binding to FN can provide a <b>costimulatory</b> <b>signal</b> to activate degranulation. TCR cross-linking also activated CD 8 -dependent adhesion to class I, and CD 8 provided a <b>costimulatory</b> <b>signal</b> upon binding to class I. However, the requirements for activating adhesion and generating the <b>costimulatory</b> <b>signal</b> differed significantly for FN versus class I ligand, suggesting that these two receptor-ligand systems do not share a common mechanism of action. Co-immobilizing FN and alloantigen resulted in increased serine esterase release in comparison with that stimulated by antigen alone, and required the FN and class I be on the same surface. Peptide and antibody blocking demonstrated that CTL binding to FN, and to vitronectin (VN), was mediated by the alpha V beta 3 vitronectin receptor (VNR). Thus, VNR is activated by a signal from the TCR to mediate adhesion to FN or VN, and delivers a <b>costimulatory</b> <b>signal</b> for degranulation via a different mechanism than costimulation by CD 8 binding to class I...|$|E

40|$|T cell {{activation}} requires {{engagement of}} the T cell receptor (TCR) with an immunogenic peptide bound {{to a major}} histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule and a <b>costimulatory</b> <b>signal</b> provided by the antigen-presenting cell (APC). Although these events result in T cell clonal expansion, ligation of the TCR alone (lack of a <b>costimulatory</b> <b>signal)</b> does not stimulate T cell activation, but rather results in unresponsiveness known as T cell anergy. Most investigations of the T cell activation mechanism have focussed on the system consisting of classical APC and T cells, but {{it is known that}} T cell can coexpress not only the adhesion molecules that provide costimulatory signals to T cells, but also their counter-receptors. In this paper, we analyze the role of adhesion molecules in T cell activation using a mouse CD 4 + T cell clone, DB 14. DB 14 cells were able to proliferate upon stimulation of the TCR/CD 3 complex alone either by appropriate MHC class II cDNA transfected CHO cells plus peptides or anti-CD 3 monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Moreover the magnitude of anti-CD 3 mAb-induced T cell proliferation was dependent on cell density, suggesting that cell to cell contact is important for the anti-CD 3 mAb-induced DB cell proliferation. The DB 14 cell expressed B 7 - 1, CD 28, ICAM- 1 and LFA- 1 molecules on its cell surface. Importantly, anti-CD 3 mAb-induced proliferation was inhibited by CTLA- 4 Ig or anti-LFA- 1 mAb and the inhibitory effect of anti-LFA- 1 mAb was stronger than that of CTLA- 4 Ig. These results suggest that DB 14 cells require two signals, the first, a TCR-mediated signal by anti-CD 3 mAb and the ?second, a <b>costimulatory</b> <b>signal</b> through interaction of B 7 /CD 28 and LFA- 1 /ICAM- 1 pathways.

To assess the functional consequences of alteration of the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in normal human T cells, the effects of vanadate and hydrogen peroxide were studied. In combination, these agents induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates, elevated cytosolic free calcium, and induced interleukin 2 receptor (IL- 2 R) alpha chain expression but not IL- 2 secretion. However, anti-CD 28 antibody in combination with vanadate and hydrogen peroxide induced IL- 2 secretion, consistent with the requirement for a <b>costimulatory</b> <b>signal</b> in the induction of this gene. The effects of vanadate and hydrogen peroxide were enhanced {{in the absence of}} the T-cell PTPase, CD 45.

Costimulation through ICAM- 1 resulted in a greater percentage of cells having undergone more than three divisions when compared to costimulation through leucocyte function-associated antigen- 1 (LFA- 1). Costimulation through ICAM- 1 also had an effect similar to costimulation through CD 28 in its ability to down-regulate the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p 27 kip 1. Costimulation through ICAM- 1 provided greater protection from apoptosis than costimulation through LFA- 1, especially in cells having divided more than three times. This was supported by the ability of costimulation through ICAM- 1 to up-regulate the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl- 2.
