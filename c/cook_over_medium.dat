40|$|Number of LPG {{needs of}} the {{community}} to end is very high, since the policy of the goverment’s planned conversion of cerosene to LPG. But the longer the energy reserves dwindling oil is characterized by an increase in the price of LPG gas, it will trigger up its business costs among SMEs, as well as rising prices {{will have an impact on}} the economic {{needs of the}} community. The objective is to get a design and dimension of bioethol-fueled stoves for small industrial burner. the step to use it is almost same with stove pressure, the differences is only in the working principle, but for bioethanol stove to small industries burner this is using principle of heat up the top burner first so, bioethanol which enter into the top burner being steam. The design of this stove is a stove under 3 inch diameter with a height of 3 cm which serves as a reactor / reagents which can already be used to <b>cook</b> <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> heat. Furnace for 3 inch diameter with a height of 3 cm donut-shaped, 1 inch diameter center hole, and there is a hole in the middle of the capillary tube measuring 3 mm in diameter serves to release the steam generated by the burner...|$|E

The objective is to get a prototype of bioethol-fueled stoves for small industrial burner. Welding is the process of switching material by using heat energy to become one with or without pressure. The process of cutting these plates can be done in various cutting techniques according to their individual needs and cutting techniques according to their individual needs.

50|$|Tocino is {{traditionally}} {{boiled in water}} (just {{enough to cover the}} meat) or fried in oil, or is <b>cooked</b> <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> heat until the fat is rendered. The original tocino is marinated only with salt, sugar, and salitre (saltpetre), although pineapple juice may be added for a slightly tart flavor. The Kapampangans who make tocino mix it for four to six hours in order to achieve thickness and softness in the meat, then leave it overnight at room temperature before serving it as burong babi (fermented pork).|$|R
50|$|To make bap, rice is {{scrubbed}} {{in water}} and rinsed several times. This process produces tteumul (water from the last washing of rice). It is then soaked for thirty minutes before boiling, which helps the grains cook evenly. With unpolished brown rice and bigger grains such as Job's tears, {{it is necessary to}} soak the grains for several hours to overnight to avoid under-cooking. The grains are then cooked. In a regular heavy bottomed pot, rice can be <b>cooked</b> <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> high heat with the lid on for about ten minutes, stirred, and then left to simmer on low heat for additional five to ten minutes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cook</b> 20 minutes <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> heat, {{then add}} 1 cup (100g) of sliced skirrets. Continue cooking until the skirrets are tender (about 15 minutes), then add a quarter cup of chopped parsley, {{half a cup}} of chopped spring onions, and a quarter cup of dill. Serve {{immediately}} in a bowl with the remaining piece of boiled bacon on top.|$|R
50|$|The {{ingredients}} {{often include}} butter or margarine, molasses, sugar, and sometimes white vinegar. The molasses {{is the critical}} ingredient, for it is less sweet than sugar and has a slightly bitter flavour that gives bonfire toffee its unique taste. One recipe calls for 230 g of butter, 230 g of treacle, and 450 g of brown sugar. The mixture is <b>cooked</b> <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> heat until melted, and allowed to boil (while constantly stirring rapidly) for 15 minutes. The hot mixture is then poured into buttered forms (such as a cake pan or special forms). Recipes calling {{for the use of}} vinegar vary these ingredients. For example, one recipe from 1922 calls for 550 g of dark brown sugar, 280 ml of molasses, one tablespoon (15 ml) of vinegar, one tablespoon (15 ml) of butter, and one teaspoon (5 ml) of sodium bicarbonate (or baking soda). White vinegar gives the toffee a slightly sharper taste, and alters the chemistry of the toffee so that it is not so brittle. It also helps the toffee to set. Other recipes call for about 5 imppt L of water, and vary the amount of the other ingredients. Some recipes call for the use of golden syrup (In the US this is light molasses mixed with corn syrup) instead of molasses/treacle.|$|R
50|$|Cooking {{is done on}} a {{charcoal}} grill. The grates are greased with pork fat, bacon, oil, butter or cooking spray {{in order to prevent}} sticking. While the meat is gently <b>cooked</b> <b>over</b> light to <b>medium</b> heat, it is basted after every turn with the marinade or with beer, sprayed directly from a gently shaken bottle. This serves to improve the taste and prevents a drying of the meat on the cooking surface. Moreover, the cooking temperature is regulated by gently spraying beer directly on the charcoal; the rising steam helps to cook and flavour the meat.|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Three {{commercial}} {{blood culture}} media {{were compared with}} a freshly prepared cooked meat medium in tests to simulate the recovery of small inocula of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria in routine blood cultures. The cooked meat medium gave the most reliable recovery and supported continued viability, whilst Fastidious Anaerobe Broth (LAB M) was a good alternative. Results with Southern Group thioglycollate and Difco Thiol were less satisfactory as delays in recovery and loss of viability occurred on continued incubation {{with some of the}} test strains. Increasing clinical awareness of the importance of anaerobic infections has resulted in the continuing need for the development of better recovery media, both for purulent material and blood cultures. The superiority of freshly prepared <b>cooked</b> meat <b>medium</b> <b>over</b> various commercially available media for routine blood cultures has previously been reported, but the use of this medium is an extra burden on busy clinical laboratories. The present study was undertaken to compare a new commercial blood culture medium Fastidious Anaerobe Broth (FAB) from LAB M, Ford Lane, Salford, with a freshly prepared cooked meat medium and two other commercial media.
