40|$|Neutrophil granulocytes {{have a short}} lifespan, {{with their}} {{survival}} limited by a <b>constitutive</b> <b>program</b> of apoptosis. Acceleration of neutrophil apoptosis following ligation of the Fas death receptor is well-documented and TNF-alpha also has a transient proapoptotic effect. We have studied {{the role of the}} death receptor ligand TRAIL in human neutrophils. We identified the presence of mRNAs for TRAIL, TRAIL-R 2, and TRAIL-R 3, and cell surface expression of TRAIL-R 2 and -R 3 in neutrophil populations. Neutrophil apoptosis is specifically accelerated by exposure to a leucine zipper-tagged form of TRAIL, which mimics cell surface TRAIL. Using blocking Abs to TRAIL receptors, specifically TRAIL-R 2, and a TRAIL-R 1 :FcR fusion protein, we have excluded a role for TRAIL in regulating constitutive neutrophil apoptosis. No additional proapoptotic effect of leucine zipper TRAIL was identified following TRAIL treatment of neutrophils in the presence of gliotoxin, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB, suggesting TRAIL does not activate NF-kappaB in human neutrophils. TRAIL treatment of human neutrophils did not induce a chemotactic response. The susceptibility of neutrophils to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis suggests a role for TRAIL in the regulation of inflammation and may provide a mechanism for clearance of neutrophils from sites of inflammation...|$|R

In the advanced stages of the disease, beta -cell dysfunction worsens and insulin therapy maybe necessary to achieve satisfactory metabolic control. Studies in autopsies found decreased beta -cell mass in pancreas of people with type 2 diabetes. Apoptosis, a <b>constitutive</b> <b>program</b> of cell death modulated by the Eel family genes, has been implicated in loss of beta -cells in animal models of type 2 diabetes. in this study, we compared the effect of 5 days' culture in high glucose concentration (16. 7 mmol/l) versus normal glucose levels (5. 5 mmol/l) or hyperosmolar control (mannitol 11 mmol/l plus glucose 5 mmol/l) on the survival of human pancreatic islets. Apoptosis, analyzed by flow cytometry and electron and immunofluorescence microscopy, was increased in islets cultured in high glucose (HG 5) as compared with normal glucose (NG 5) or hyperosmolar control (NG 5 +MAN 5). We also analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting {{the expression of the}} Bcl family genes in human islets cultured in normal glucose or high glucose. The antiapoptotic gene Bcl- 2 was unaffected by glucose change, whereas Bcl-xl was reduced upon treatment with HG 5. On the other hand, proapoptotic genes Bad, Bid, and Bik were overexpressed in the islets maintained in HG 5. To define the pancreatic localization of Bcl proteins, me performed confocal immunofluorescence analysis on human pancreas. Bad and Bid mere specifically expressed in beta -cells, and Bid was also expressed, although at low levels, in the exocrine pancreas. Bik and Bcl-xl were expressed in other endocrine islet cells {{as well as in the}} exocrine pancreas. These data suggest that in human islets, high glucose may modulate the balance of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic Eel proteins toward apoptosis, thus favoring beta -cell death...|$|R
40|$|The accomplishments {{achieved}} {{under the}} isotropic creep-fatigue crack initiation life prediction program are summarized. A sizeable creep-fatigue crack initiation data base was generated on the nickel-base superalloy, B- 1900. Companion <b>constitutive</b> modeling <b>programs</b> have also generated extensive data bases {{on the same}} heat of material. The crack initiation results have {{formed the basis of}} a new approach to creep-fatigue life prediction. The term Cyclic Damage Accumulation (CDA) was coined for the method, which was evaluated under isothermal, uniaxial conditions. Stringent laboratory verification experiments were used to test the accuracy of the method. Considering the quite limited material property data needed to evaluate the constants in the approach, the prediction accuracy is acceptable. At the expense of the larger data base required, Lewis developed total strain- strainrange partitioning method (TS-SRP) is capable of a higher degree of accuracy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a finite layer procedure for Biot's consolidation analysis of layered soils using a cross-anisotropic elastic <b>constitutive</b> model. The <b>program</b> is first verified using published results. Then, using this program, {{the influences of}} cross-anisotropy on the immediate settlement, the final settlement, and the consolidation behaviour are investigated by changing one model parameter at one time. The results obtained using the cross-anisotropic elastic model are compared with results using an isotropic elastic model. It is found that the cross-anisotropy has very large influences on the immediate settlement, the final settlement, and the consolidation behaviour. Curves or tables of the immediate settlement coefficients, the final settlement coefficients, and the average degree of consolidation are obtained and presented in the paper. These curves or tables can be easily used to estimate the immediate settlement, the final settlement, and the consolidation settlement of a cross-anisotropic soil.

40|$|Sepsis and {{septic shock}} are {{characterized}} by prolonged inflammation and delayed resolution, which are associated with suppression of neutrophil apoptosis. The role of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and intracellular factors in regulation of neutrophil apoptosis remain incompletely understood. We previously reported that the nuclear factor MNDA (myeloid nuclear differentiation antigen) is fundamental to execution of the <b>constitutive</b> neutrophil death <b>program.</b> During neutrophil apoptosis MNDA is cleaved by caspases and relocated to the cytoplasm. However, when challenged with known mediators of sepsis, human neutrophils of healthy donors or neutrophils from patients with sepsis exhibited impaired MNDA relocation/cleavage parallel with MCL- 1 accumulation and suppression of apoptosis. MNDA knockdown in a model cell line indicated that upon induction of apoptosis, MNDA promotes proteasomal degradation of MCL- 1, thereby aggravating mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, MNDA is central to a novel nucleus-mitochondrion circuit that promotes progression of apoptosis. Disruption of this circuit contributes to neutrophil longevity, thereby identifying MNDA as a potential therapeutic target in sepsis and other inflammatory pathologies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{compatible}} solute hypothesis {{posits that}} maintaining osmotic equilibrium {{under conditions of}} high salinity requires synthesis of organic compounds, uptake of potassium ions, and partial exclusion of NaCl. To assess whether osmotic adaptation in Limonium latifolium proceeds according to this hypothesis, a comprehensive analysis of solute accumulation during NaCl treatments was conducted. Determination of prevailing inorganic ions and establishment of the metabolic profiles for low M(r) organic substances revealed that contrary to the mentioned hypothesis the major contributors to osmolarity were constituted by inorganic solutes. Independent of salinity, only 25 % of this osmolarity resulted from organic solutes such as Suc and hexoses. Proline (Pro), beta-alanine betaine, and choline-O-sulfate were minor contributors to osmolarity. Compatible inositols also occurred, especially chiro-inositol, characterized {{for the first time}} in this species, to our knowledge. Principal component analysis showed that only a limited number of metabolic reconfigurations occurred in response to dynamic changes in salinity. Under such conditions only sugars, chiro-inositol, and Pro behave as active osmobalancers. Analysis of metabolic profiles during acclimatization to either mild salinity or nonsaline conditions showed that organic solute accumulation is predominantly controlled by <b>constitutive</b> developmental <b>programs,</b> some of which might be slightly modulated by salinity. Osmolarity provided under such conditions can be sufficient to maintain turgor in salinized seedlings. Compartmental analysis of Pro and beta-alanine betaine in leaf tissues demonstrated that these solutes, mainly located in vacuoles under nonsaline conditions, could be partly directed to the cytosol in response to salinization. Thus they did not conform with the predictions of the compatible solute hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Interleukin (IL) - 5 is a hematopoietic {{cytokine}} able {{to regulate}} differentiation, survival, and effector functions of eosinophils. It binds spe-cifically to its receptor, which {{is composed of}} a cytokine-specific -chain and a -chain shared with the receptors for IL- 3 and the granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor. The molec-ular mechanisms by which IL- 5 modulates eosino-phil survival remain unclear. In this study, we dem-onstrate that IL- 5 withdrawal induces eosinophil apoptosis through a mitochondria-dependent path-way, independently of Fas receptor activation. The lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol- 3 kinase {{plays a crucial role}} in the maintenance of eosinophil sur-vival, as inhibition of its activity results in apopto-sis. IL- 5 induces phosphorylation and thus, inhibi-tion of the Forkhead transcription factor FOXO 3 a and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK- 3). We ana-lyzed expression of FOXO 3 a-dependent transcrip-tional targets: Fas ligand or Bim (a proapoptotic Bcl- 2 family member), but neither was detected in apoptotic eosinophils. We further show that GSK- 3 is activated after IL- 5 withdrawal, and inhibition of its activity rescues eosinophils from apoptosis. -catenin, a direct GSK- 3 substrate, is present in the nucleus of IL- 5 -stimulated eosinophils, but it is translocated to the plasma membrane in the ab-sence of cytokine in a GSK- 3 -dependent manner. This is the first report describing a potential role for GSK- 3 and -catenin in regulating eosinophil survival and suggests a novel mechanism by which IL- 5 inhibits the <b>constitutive</b> apoptotic <b>program</b> in these cells.

40|$|Postmitotic cell growth defines cell {{shape and}} size during development. However, the {{mechanisms}} regulating postmitotic cell growth in plants remain unknown. Here we report {{the discovery of a}} basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor called RSL 4 (ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6 -LIKE 4) that is sufficient to promote postmitotic cell growth in Arabidopsis thaliana root-hair cells. Loss of RSL 4 function resulted in the development of very short root hairs. In contrast, constitutive RSL 4 expression <b>programmed</b> <b>constitutive</b> growth, resulting in the formation of very long root hairs. Hair-cell growth signals, such as auxin and low phosphate availability, modulate hair cell extension by regulating RSL 4 transcript and protein levels. RSL 4 is thus a regulator of growth that integrates endogenous developmental and exogenous environmental signals that together control postmitotic growth in root hairs. The control of postmitotic growth by transcription factors may represent a general mechanism for regulating cell size across diverse organisms.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{three new}} three-dimensional constitutive models for cementitious materials. All three models use embedded damage planes and adopt {{the theory of}} contact mechanics to describe the characteristic behaviour of cracks formed in concrete and other cementitious materials. The first of these is a smooth frictional contact model which incorporates a simplified Mohr-Coulomb yield surface to capture plastic slip planes in concrete. The aim of the model is to accurately represent the behaviour of smooth construction joints in large concrete structures. The second proposed model is the dual-surface contact model. The model employs two contact surfaces, each of which nominally represents a different component of concrete composite, i. e. coarse aggregate particles and mortar. The third model is the 'embedded planes with local plasticity contact' model (EPLPC). The model adopts a yield surface, {{which is similar to}} the damage surface in strain space, to capture plastic embedment on crack surfaces. This model, as with the dual-surface contact model, is developed to simulate crack opening-closing, as well as the behaviour of aggregate interlock. The models are integrated with a hardening/softening frictional plasticity component that uses a smoothed triaxial plastic yield surface developed from that used by Lubliner et al. (1989). Each of the proposed models is implemented with a consistent tangent stiffness operator and return mapping algorithm, {{similar to that of the}} Closest Point Projection algorithm. The models are coded in Fortran 77 and implemented in a <b>constitutive</b> driver <b>program,</b> and also a finite element software package LUSAS. The models are assessed using a series of stress/strain paths at the constitutive level, and also validated against a range of experimental data. These include data from uniaxial and multiaxial compressive tests, uniaxial tensile tests with and without unloading-reloading cycles, and also tests in which shear load is applied on open cracks...|$|R

The ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE SIX-LIKE 1 (PpRSL 1) and PpRSL 2 basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors and auxin promote {{the development of}} caulonema in Physcomitrella patens but the mechanism by which these regulators interact during development is unknown. • We characterized the role of auxin in regulating the function of PpRSL 1 and PpRSL 2 in the chloronema-to-caulonema transition during protonema development. • Here, we showed that a gradient of cell identity developed along protonemal filaments; cells were chloronemal in proximal regions {{near the site of}} spore germination becoming progressively more caulonemal distally as filaments elongated. Auxin controlled this transition by positively regulating the expression of PpRSL 1 and PpRSL 2 genes. Auxin did not induce caulonemal development in Pprsl 1 Pprsl 2 double mutants that lack PpRSL 1 and PpRSL 2 gene activity while constitutive co-expression of PpRSL 1 and PpRSL 2 in the absence of auxin was sufficient to <b>program</b> <b>constitutive</b> caulonema development. • Together, these data indicate that auxin positively regulates PpRSL 1 and PpRSL 2 whose expression is sufficient to promote caulonema differentiation in moss protonema. © 2011 New Phytologist Trust...|$|R

The program was composed of a base program and an optional program. The base program addressed the high temperature coated single crystal regime above the airfoil root platform. The optional program investigated the low temperature uncoated single crystal regime below the airfoil root platform including the notched conditions of the airfoil attachment. Both base and option programs involved experimental and analytical efforts. Results from uniaxial constitutive and fatigue life experiments of coated and uncoated PWA 1480 single crystal material {{formed the basis for}} the analytical modeling effort. Four single crystal primary orientations were used in the experiments: group of zone axes (001), group of zone axes (011), group of zone axes (111), and group of zone axes (213). Specific secondary orientations were also selected for the notched experiments in the optional <b>program.</b> <b>Constitutive</b> models for an overlay coating and PWA 1480 single crystal materials were developed based on isothermal hysteresis loop data and verified using thermomechanical (TMF) hysteresis loop data.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with investigating the role of mathematical programming in expressing {{the general theory of}} and facilitating effective computation for elasto-plastic skeletal structures subjected to deterministic sources of dynamic excitations, Static-kinematic duality, a common feature in the static analysis of structures, is extended to dynamic systems through the adoption of d'Alembert's principle. This allows the full use of graph theoretic methods for describing the fundamental structural relations in both mesh and nodal forms. For structures whose dynamic characteristics can be effectively described by a rigid-plastic <b>constitutive</b> law, mathematical <b>programming</b> formulations are presented. They are compared and contrasted with existing formulations, especially those associated with impact loading. Elasto-plastic structures are studied and their dynamic response is shown to be given by the solution of a differential linear complementarity problem. Four equivalent formulations are presented and are solved numerically through the use of direct integration methods. The effects of change of geometry may also be important in the dynamic analysis of structures. Firstly, for relatively small displacements, the method of fictitious forces is shown to lead to alternative mesh and nodal formulations. For large displacements, only the nodal method proves to be effective. An incremental differential linear complementarity problem is obtained and a suitable numerical solution procedure is proposed. Finally, a perturbation technique is established for solving the resulting differential equations and differential linear complementarity problems. It is proved that this technique is more general and flexible than the direct integration methods. Open Acces...|$|R

Although numerical simulation can hopefully optimize the core shooting process, research on numerical simulation of the core shooting process is very limited. Based on a two-fluid model (TFM) and a kinetic-friction <b>constitutive</b> correlation, a <b>program</b> for 3 D numerical simulation of the core shooting process has been developed and achieved good agreements with in-situ experiments. To match the needs of engineering applications, a graphics processing unit (GPU) has also been used to improve the calculation efficiency. The parallel algorithm based on the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) platform can significantly decrease computing time by multi-threaded GPU. In this work, the program accelerated by CUDA parallelization method was developed and the accuracy of the calculations was ensured by comparing with in-situ experimental results photographed by a high-speed camera. The design and optimization of the parallel algorithm were discussed. The simulation result of a sand core test-piece indicated the improvement of the calculation efficiency by GPU. The developed program has also been validated by in-situ experiments with a transparent core-box, a high-speed camera, and a pressure measuring system. The computing time of the parallel program was reduced by nearly 95 % while the simulation result was still quite consistent with experimental data.
