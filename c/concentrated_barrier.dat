The tests were conducted in a three- entry section of the LLEM. Two types of explosions were used {{to evaluate the}} distributed and concentrated bagged barrier performance in a multi-entry mine section. The fuel zone of the first explosion type was only in the center B-drift. In the second explosion type, coal and stone dust mixtures were place in all three drifts. A total of six explosions, including two baseline and four barrier evaluation explosions, were conducted. Of the four barrier explosions, the distributed and concentrated barriers were each evaluated against the two explosion types. For these explosion tests, the distributed barrier extended from about 74 to 170 m and the <b>concentrated</b> <b>barrier</b> from about 74 to 104 m in B-drift. The distributed barrier successfully stopped flame propagation in both types of explosion tests. The flame extended further for the explosion tests where the dust was loaded in all three entries compared with dust loaded only in the center entry% but in both cases the flame was stopped within the barrier zone. The <b>concentrated</b> <b>barrier</b> was also successful in stopping flame propagation m both explosion tests. From the full-scale experimental mine test results, it can be concluded that both bagged barrier designs were effective in stopping coal dust explosions in the multiple entries of the LLEM...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a three-stage game {{to examine how}} market integration affects firms' incentives to provide general worker training. In stage 1, firms invest in productivity-enhancing training. In stage 2, they can make wage offers for each others' workers. Finally, Cournot competition takes place. When two product markets become integrated, that is, replaced by a market with greater demand and more firms, training by each firm increases, provided the two markets are initially sufficiently <b>concentrated.</b> When <b>barriers</b> between less <b>concentrated</b> markets are eliminated, training is reduced. Integration increases welfare {{if it does not}} reduce training. However, for large parameter regions, welfare decreases if integration reduces training.

Using emergency contraception as a backup method can contribute to reduce unwanted pregnancy secondary to method failure, contraception non-use and also rape.

40|$|International {{negotiations}} on the liberalisation of service trade are <b>concentrated</b> at non-tariff <b>barriers</b> (NTBs). National government measures form important obstacles for service providers {{when they want to}} access foreign markets. International studies predict substantial welfare benefits from removing trade obstacles for services. Negotiations on lowering these obstacles are complicated because government regulations are seldom strictly oriented at keeping foreign firms out their domestic service markets. Some of them (e. g. quantity-based restrictions) are clearly at odds with WTO principles. We argue however that in most cases regulators primarily aimed at correcting domestic market failures with disregard for the potential repercussions for foreign providers of services. In negotiations this problem can be approached by introducing economic necessity tests, but that is a very long and tedious process. We propose a different negotiation approach based on lessons learned from WTO {{negotiations on}} agricultural support measures. ...|$|R

The key difference between the previous studies is that {{in this paper we}} are <b>concentrated</b> on single <b>barrier</b> options. Barrier options were formed to provide risk managers with cheaper means to hedge their exposures without paying for the price changes they believed unlikely to occur. The methodology is based on the profit functions in analytical form. We propose various hedging possibilities and show its practical application. In our analysis we used vanilla and barrier European options on SPDR Gold Shares.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{contribute}} to the empirical literature which investigates barriers for innovation in less developed countries. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have been identified as an important strategic sector for promoting growth and social development of Sri Lanka. Though SMEs have gained wide recognition as a major source of employment, income generation, poverty alleviation and regional development in Sri Lanka, the annual growth rate is at a low level due to lack of innovation and inefficient management. Thus, this research, conducted in Sri Lanka, a small less developed country, <b>concentrates</b> on <b>barriers</b> approach to innovation. The empirical analysis was carried out at the firm-level, on the ground of a survey covering 50 SMEs in Sri Lanka. A percentage analysis and a regression analysis were carried out to identify the most important external and internal barriers to innovation as perceived by the owners or senior managers in SMEs. The most important external barriers, as perceived by the firms' owners/managers were lack of capital for R& D (bank loans), shortage of necessary technical skills, easy to copy and lack of opportunities to cooperate with other firms and institutions. The paper finds that inadequate financial means, lack of qualified managerial or technical persons, inadequate R&D, excessively perceived risk of innovation and lack of time as the strongest internal barriers for their organizations. The study of barriers offers, nevertheless, some interesting clues to the innovation practice in small less developed countries. Some similarities with barriers in industrialized countries were found, but many differences as expected from the peculiar environment in countries like Sri Lanka...|$|R
40|$|Business {{strategies}} and policies which {{proved to be}} successful in increasing internet penetration in the early days may no longer be appropriate. This is likely to be highly probable in countries where the majority of people are already connected to the internet. As more people have the ability to be connected online, it becomes more likely that the remaining fraction of non-adopters is either difficult to convince, under-skilled or simply lacking the financial resources to afford a connection. In view of this problem, this paper proposes a policy approach aimed at increasing personal computer and internet acceptance in collaboration with industry. The measures developed within this approach are based on strategies of segmentation and differentiation. This entails the specific targeting of product offerings towards different socio-demographic groups within the population. In addition, our approach not only <b>concentrates</b> on removing <b>barriers,</b> as most e-inclusion policies do, but also at increasing the value of ICT for end-users. This approach is based on a project that applied both qualitative and quantitative research methods in an investigation to determine the relationship between the socio-demographi...|$|R
40|$|The {{unwinding}} of {{the parental}} DNA duplex during replication causes a positive linking number difference, or superhelical strain, {{to build up}} around the elongating replication fork. The branching at the fork and this strain bring about different conformations from that of (−) supercoiled DNA that is not being replicated. The replicating DNA can form (+) precatenanes, in which the daughter DNAs are intertwined, and (+) supercoils. Topoisomerases have the essential role of relieving the superhelical strain by removing these structures. Stalled replication forks of molecules with a (+) superhelical strain have the additional option of regressing, forming a four-way junction at the replication fork. This four-way junction can be acted on by recombination enzymes to restart replication. Replication and chromosome folding are made easier by topological domain barriers, which sequester the substrates for topoisomerases into defined and <b>concentrated</b> regions. Domain <b>barriers</b> also allow replicated DNA to be (−) supercoiled. We discuss the importance of replicating DNA conformations and the roles of topoisomerases, focusing on recent work from our laboratory...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} business lobbying at the WTO. It {{argues that}} the role of companies in multilateral trade is tightly linked to the evolution of the trading system, with the most decisive influence during the creation of the WTO institutions. In an initial phase, business lobbying <b>concentrated</b> on tariff <b>barriers.</b> As the GATT expanded its scope during the Uruguay Round, large US companies became very active participants and crucially shaped the agenda, in particular with respect to service trade and intellectual property rights. In other areas, however, active lobbying was less effective, most notably investment protection and textiles. With the establishment of the WTO, lobbying has begun to partially shift to the supranational level. Some relationships exist between the WTO secretariat and companies, but the most important new pillar of political activity relates to dispute settlement. At the same time, the WTO secretariat tries to reach out to a more diverse set of stakeholders. In many ways, the influence of global companies on WTO affairs is much more indirect today than it was during its creation...|$|R

In the past, while much of the rest of the world spent its time pondering issues such as global warming, water, air, and soil pollution, over-exploitation of resources, and a myriad of other environmental concerns, the Saudi people and government seemed to be primarily focused on expanding their capital in a globalized economy. However, in 2015, for the first time, this trend began to show legitimate change. This new emphasis on environmental concerns has caused some interest and uproar, specifically in the economic sector.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} on older folks/ elderly people known as golden baby boomers’ feelings and beliefs (perceptions) concerning online social networking. The purpose was to establish on their perceived likelihood of participation on online social network sites. Golden Baby boomers in this context refer to individuals that are specifically born between 1945 and 1964. A qualitative research method and an interpretive research philosophy were followed in the investigation. Results from the study exposed six main feelings and beliefs, which are; lack of security/privacy, difficulties in adapting to culture, too much exposure to information, lack of time, inability to authenticate other users, and, the perception that Social Network Sites provide no value to the elderly. A number of studies pertaining to social networking focus primarily on the use of Social networks by young people and rarely focus on elderly people. The studies that do focus on older folks <b>concentrate</b> on technology <b>barriers</b> that hinder them from participation.

40|$|A {{review is}} given {{that focuses on}} why the {{sideways}} mixing of potential vorticity (PV) across its background gradient tends to be inhomogeneous, arguably a reason why persistent jets are commonplace in planetary atmospheres and oceans, and why such jets tend to sharpen themselves when disturbed. PV mixing often produces a sideways layering or banding of the PV distribution and therefore a corresponding number of jets, as dictated by PV inversion. There is a positive feedback in which mixing weakens the “Rossby wave elasticity ” associated with the sideways PV gradients, facilitating further mixing. A partial analogy is drawn with the Phillips effect, the spontaneous layering of a stably stratified fluid, in which vertically homogeneous stirring produces vertically inhomogeneous mixing of the background buoyancy gradient. The Phillips effect has been extensively studied and has been clearly demonstrated in laboratory experiments. However, the “eddy-transport barriers ” and sharp jets characteristic of extreme PV inhomogeneity, associated with strong PV mixing and strong sideways layering into Jupiter-like “PV staircases,” with sharp PV contrasts �qbarrier, say, involve two additional factors besides the Rossby wave elasticity <b>concentrated</b> at the <b>barriers.</b> The first is shear straining by the colocated eastward jets. PV inversion implies that the jets are an essential, not an incidental, part of the barrier structure. The shear straining increase...|$|R
40|$|Globalization is {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in cross-border economic, social, technological exchange under the conditions of capitalism. International trade and investment have been the engines of world growth over the past 50 years. The tons of goods traded {{around the world have}} grown by 16 times since 1950, reflecting the lowering of tariff barriers. The growth of trade in services is even greater. Many people believe that exports create jobs, and imports cost jobs and that it therefore makes sense to have barriers against imports. Countries that lower trade <b>barriers</b> <b>concentrate</b> their national energies in industries they are good at, where they have an international advantage. Integration in the world economy contributes to environmental improvements by promoting growth, increasing incomes, improving property right and the allowing the efficient use of resources. Import barriers encourage countries to focus efforts in industries where they do not have any advantage. It leads to wasteful and lazy investment. There is evidence that developing countries that erect barriers to imports have slower growth in incomes than those that are open to trade. Companies of all sizes are involved in world trade – the benefits do not just flow to large multi-nationals. WTO rules expressly permit countries to take actions to protect human, animal or plant life or health, and to conserve exhaustible natural resources. However, such restrictions must pursue legitimate environmental objectives, and not be a disguised form of trade protectionism. The WTO rules do not prevent countries from banning or restricting the marketing of genetically modified organisms.

40|$|The {{research}} {{is based on}} the European Directive aimed at harmonising standards for construction products. Harmonised standards remove technical barriers to trade allowing manufacturers to sell their products anywhere in the European Economic Area (EEA) provided the product complies with the standard and has affixed the CE marking. This should lead to greater competition in all EEA markets. A review of relevant literature covered three distinct areas; developments of the European Union and the Construction Products Directive (CPD), the UK construction industry and materials sector and strategic management <b>concentrating</b> on market <b>barriers</b> and entry strategies. The research combined these areas together by investigating the impact of the CPD on the UK construction product manufacturers specifically considering the strategic decisions of the UK brick industry. As there was little previous empirical research into this area, data was generated through exploratory interviews with manufacturers and bodies involved with the UK implementation of the Directive, through a self-completion postal questionnaire survey with manufacturers from six product groups and by a case study approach used to examine the UK brick industry. The research demonstrated that the Directive is having little impact to date on the strategic decisions of UK construction product manufacturers. Also, there are a disturbing number of producers that were not aware of the Directive and its possible implications. By applying previous research findings to the UK brick industry, conclusions were drawn highlighting the specific nature of this industry and identifying specific characteristics that influence its competitiveness. The Directive and the UK brick industry have never previously been examined in such a manner and areas for further research have been suggested...|$|R

One tool to manage sustainability is green marketing; an approach through which companies can gain competitive advantage. But is it possible to influence the market structure by using green marketing and is it possible to make it difficult for new actors to enter the market? Purpose: The purpose of this research is to investigate how companies can use green marketing to create entry barriers. Delimitations: This thesis is delimited to investigate the work of creating entry barriers, not to measure the effect of it. Furthermore the empirical research only includes companies on the Swedish market. Method: To investigate how companies use green marketing in relation to entry barriers today a quantitative approach was used and an electronic questionnaire was conducted. Conclusion: For established companies to protect their position on the market it is important to not only <b>concentrate</b> on the <b>barriers</b> most commonly related to green marketing. Rather green companies can establish a wide spectrum of barriers related to green marketing {{in order to make it}} more difficult for new entrants to establish themselves. Suggestions for further research: The next step to make within the field of green marketing as a barrier to entry is to investigate the effect of the barriers examined in this research. It is also necessary to do industry specific researches to investigate if some barriers are more important for certain industries. Keywords: Entry barriers, environmental commitment, green entry barriers, green marketing, strategic barriers to entry, structural barriers to entry, sustainability. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} provides {{empirical evidence}} consistent with auditors transferring some information from one client to another and, as a consequence, with same industry rivals being reluctant {{to share the}} same auditor due to information spillover concerns. In the first essay, using exogenous shocks to the auditing industry, including large auditor mergers {{and the collapse of}} Arthur Andersen, I document a reluctance of rivals to engage the same auditor due to information spillover concerns. This reluctance is more evident in <b>concentrated</b> industries where <b>barriers</b> to mobility, proxied by differentiation and capital expenditure levels, are low. More secretive manufacturing firms are also more reluctant to share their auditor with a rival. I also find weak evidence that the concern for information spillovers is lessened when rivals are dissimilar in terms of sales or when they are headquartered in the same state, where other conduits for information spillover, including employee turnover, are present. Last, I find some evidence that auditors extract rents from clients concerned about information spillovers. In the second essay, I present evidence consistent with auditors being a conduit for information spillovers. My results indicate that firms sharing the same auditor are more alike in their investment, research and development, advertising and SG&A decisions compared to firms not sharing the same auditor. Causality is established using the collapse of Arthur Andersen as a natural experiment that broke channels for information spillovers for former clients of the auditing firm. Results are still valid after the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), indicating that the core auditing practice of auditors is a conduit for information spillovers. I also find some evidence that information spillovers are more prominent at the auditor office level. Last, additional evidence from patent citations indicates that information spillovers through sharing the same auditor may lead to dissemination of technological innovations among client firms...|$|R
40|$|Executive Summary This report {{provides}} an analysis {{and evaluation of}} the UK audit market. It looks at the market structure in conjunction with decisive factors, considering the role of auditors and regulatory standards for statutory auditing. The analysis commences with the elucidation of auditing financial statements with regulatory standards, including collation between standards, to comprehend the current internationalization of accounting and influence on audit quality and audit market structure. The UK audit market has been examined thoroughly {{in terms of the}} so called ?Big Four?? (PwC, Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG) audit market concentration, competition, auditor rotation, audit fee, and audit quality. Audit market concentration has been measured through the concentration ratio and the Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index, considering audit companies? revenue to clarify market shares between Big Four companies and mid-tier firms. In so doing, the two biggest accountancy firms, PwC and Deloitte, were also investigated to ascertain their influence on the market by assessing their last five years? financial analysis to evaluate the future audit market concentration amid accountancy firms in the UK. Methods of analysis include comprehensive ratio analysis to measure liquidity, asset management, debt management and profitability. Pertinent elaborated calculations {{can be found in the}} appendices. Results of data analysed demonstrate that the UK audit market is most <b>concentrated</b> with considerable <b>barriers</b> to entry and switching, since the Big Four have constant and high market share of FTSE companies. As is evident from the Deloitte and PwC?s ratio analysis results, they have consistent and robust positive indicators; so bridging the gap between midtier and Big Four companies would not be straightforward for the near future. Despite pessimistic results, some recommendations may alleviate this concentration: ? The confusions of financial reporting and auditing standards resulting from the paucity of adaptation should be lessened. ? Mandatory joint audit may be useful to reduce market concentration by signing off audit report and opinion by the each audit firm; on the condition that one joint auditor should be non-Big four companies. viii ? Mandatory rotation should not be prolonged for more than fifteen years. At the same time, tendering should be in a transparent and veritable-based approach to achieve salutary results. ? Companies should report transparently choice and investors should display persuasive motive in auditor choice. ? Prudence and transparency should be controlled by the regulators for steering audit market, to attain stability of financial systems. ? In terms of changing perception bias towards to mid-tier or small audit firms, reputation should be improved through enhancing occupational skills, such as sector expertise, international network and excellence of staff...|$|R
40|$|Rules on {{abuse of}} {{dominance}} {{are used to}} find a balance between three objectives: 1) ensuring enough competition between firms in order {{to force them to}} be efficient and to compete on merit, 2) allowing a certain degree of profitability so that companies have incentives to become more efficient, and 3) achieving an equal distribution of wealth and business opportunities among different sectors of society. While the discussion in developed countries focuses on the first two aspects in order to maximize innovation and growth, developing countries may also want to consider the third dimension and include the reduction of inequality and poverty as objectives of abuse of dominance laws. But even the relationship between the first two aspects tends to vary among regions, because investment depends on factors that differ between developing and developed countries. These factors sometimes contradict each other and it is crucial to find a sound balance between them. Firstly, since developing economies often have smaller markets and, therefore, a lower equilibrium number of firms that can exploit economies of scale and operate efficiently, markets in developing countries {{are more likely to be}} <b>concentrated.</b> Furthermore, entry <b>barriers</b> tend to be higher and capital markets are often less developed, which causes obstacles for firms trying to compete with a dominant company. Secondly, large firms play a different role regarding their investment activity in developing countries than they do in more developed economies. Established firms can be important for less developed economies to have a sufficiently high level of investment in production. In such countries, the benefits of increased investments may outweigh efficiency losses that can arise from a more lax treatment of dominant firm conduct. Thirdly, distributional aspects may be especially important for developing countries. Smaller firms, which often represent poorer sectors of society, may have to be given better chances to compete against large dominant companies. Competition law can be used for such public interest issues, but it is crucial that the law gives clear guidance on how these objectives should be balanced against other objectives such as efficiency. The comparison of the EU and the US regarding abuse of dominance shows that significant differences exist even among developed countries. One reason for the disparity is differing assumptions about what types of conduct are harmful and how difficult it is to differentiate them from other conduct. The 'access to market principle' of the EU arises from the assumption that restrictions of market access are harmful to the economy and that a harmful conduct can be distinguished from other, not harmful, conduct. On the other hand, the 'non-intervention principle' of the US is based on the assumption that the distinction of such conduct is difficult, that there is great danger of prohibiting behaviour that is efficient and that the unnecessary prohibition of efficient conduct is severe. One conclusion from the comparison is that these assumptions should be analysed and be grounded on the economic reality. How likely and severe errors of competition authorities are can, for example, be assessed in an analysis of past decisions and their effects on the economy. Support of developing countries' competition authorities in analysing their own cases and the impact of their decisions on the economy would therefore be valuable...|$|R
