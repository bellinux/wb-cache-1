We approximate the mechanism’s behaviour about a reference configuration, resulting in a first order reduced compliant system, or FORK- 1 S [1]. Our approach is fast, and computation of the full structure’s state is parallelized. The approach is suitable for articulate mechanisms using static proportional derivative (PD), such as those found in robotic simulation or physics based character animation. We demonstrate that simulations with our method can deal with kinematic chains with loops and non-uniform joint stiffness, and that it produces plausible effects due to stiffness, damping, and inertia...|$|E

So, this study focused on evaluating the rollover strength through a computer simulation using the commercial code, LS-DYNA 3 D at the initial stage of vehicle development. For this purpose, section structure of the bus frame was first modeled using simple beam elements, and the impact boundary conditions required by ECE regulation No. 66 were applied. In order to validate the beam element model, the simulation results were compared to those of shell element model. Since the analysis error with beam element model was mainly caused by the difference in strain energy at the T-shaped <b>connecting</b> <b>joint,</b> the joint connection was modified with nonlinear springs {{to account for the}} local buckling. With the improved beam model, the results were in a good agreement to shell element model, but the simulation times were much reduced...|$|E

Experimental results show that the proposed dead volume free electro-spray chip is able to reach the desired goal. It is also found from the experiments that the ringlike cross-section of the needle embedded micro-channel is critical to the stability of the Taylor cone at the spray-tip.

Particle imaging velocimetry provides insight into the deformation history of the experiments and illustrates the localization pattern of fault segments.

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{analysis}} of a novel data link layer mechanism introduced in our previous work for realtime service provisioning in multi-hop wireless networks. To combat packet loss along unreliable paths connecting the source with the destination (i) packet transmissions are distributed along the multiple paths <b>connecting</b> <b>joint</b> nodes and (ii) the redundancy packets are utilized to recover the lost packets on these intermediate connections. The regenerating nodes (RNs), where the actual packet loss recovery is performed in the network, minimize the accumulated number of lost packets at the destination. This joint application of packet level Forward Error Control (FEC) and multiple path routing allows {{to meet the requirements}} of real-time transmissions, such as fixed delays and guaranteed Packet Loss Rate (PLR). The proposed scheme achieves load balancing along the multiple paths which are chosen for packet forwarding based on their PLR. The scheme is flexible sufficiently to accommodate various constraints for delay and reliability that can be tailored to the specific applications. Monte Carlo simulations are provided to demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed scheme in different topology and PLR scenarios with special attention given to the choice of the RN positions in the network...|$|E

40|$|Nature {{has evolved}} a {{beautiful}} design for small-scale vibratory rategyro {{in the form}} of dipteran halteres that detect body rotations via Coriolis acceleration. In most Diptera, including soldier fly, Hermetia illucens, halteres are a pair of special organs, located in the space between the thorax and the abdomen. The halteres along with their <b>connecting</b> <b>joint</b> with the fly's body constitute a mechanism that is used for muscle-actuated oscillations of the halteres along the actuation direction. These oscillations lead to bending vibrations in the sensing direction (out of the haltere's actuation plane) upon any impressed rotation due to the resulting Coriolis force. This induced vibration is sensed by the sensory organs {{at the base of the}} haltere in order to determine the rate of rotation. In this study, we evaluate the boundary conditions and the stiffness of the anesthetized halteres along the actuation and the sensing direction. We take several cross-sectional SEM (scanning electron microscope) images of the soldier fly haltere and construct its three dimensional model to get the mass properties. Based on these measurements, we estimate the natural frequency along both actuation and sensing directions, propose a finite element model of the haltere's joint mechanism, and discuss the significance of the haltere's asymmetric cross-section. The estimated natural frequency along the actuation direction is within the range of the haltere's flapping frequency. However, the natural frequency along the sensing direction is roughly double the haltere's flapping frequency that provides a large bandwidth for sensing the rate of rotation to the soldier flies...|$|E

Surrounding saturated porous medium of tunnels is described by Biot's poroelastic theory, while the liner pieces and the <b>connecting</b> <b>joints</b> are treated as curved beams and characterized by curved beam theories. The scattered wave field in the porous medium is obtained by the wave function expansion method. The differential equations governing the vibration of a curved beam is discretized by the General Differential Quadrature (GDQ) method. The domain decomposition method is used to establish the global discrete dynamic equations for the piecewise tunnel. The surrounding soil and the tunnel are coupled together via the stress and the displacement continuation conditions which are implemented by the boundary collocation method. Numerical results demonstrate that the stiffness difference between the liner piece and the <b>connecting</b> <b>joints</b> has a considerable influence on the internal forces of the liner piece.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{focuses on}} {{developing}} efficient computation method in fatigue life estimations of damaged structural components. The {{aim of this}} paper is to examine the strength behavior of an important constructional element, the lug, when fatigue cracked, and to propose a stress intensity solution considering various lug geometries. The structural fatigue failure of a common <b>connecting</b> <b>joint</b> used to attach aircraft wing-fuselage components was investigated too. In the fatigue crack growth and fracture analysis of lugs, accurate calculation of the stress intensity factor (K) is essential. To obtain efficient algorithm in crack growth analysis here is derived analytic model for the stress intensity of damaged lug. For this purpose numerical modeling was used to determine stress intensity factor (K) solution for an aluminum lug with a through-the-thickness crack. A contact stress analysis was used to analyze the load transfer between the pin and lug. Fracture mechanics approaches are used to estimate the propagation life. It contains the developed analytical methodologies for determining the stress intensity factors for single through the thickness cracks in the aircraft attachment lugs, and for predicting the growth behavior of these cracks. Computational investigation of the lug not only enables the stress intensity to be determined, but also shows the interrelationship between the essential lug parameters, the crack propagation behavior and the stress distribution in a non-cracked lug. Finally, it is possible to evaluate a stress intensity solution for cracked lugs in the form of a semi-empirical approach, which takes into account the essential lug parameters. Key words: damage tolerance analysis, fracture mechanics, crack growth, damaged lugs, analytic methods. 1...|$|E
