Controls on the global distribution of surge-type glaciers hold the keys {{to a better understanding of}} surge mechanisms. We investigate correlations between the distribution of surge-type glaciers and climatic and glacier geometry variables, using a new global geodatabase of 2317 surge-type glaciers. The highest densities of surge-type glaciers occur within an optimal climatic envelope bounded by temperature and precipitation thresholds. Across all regions with both surge-type and normal glaciers, the former are larger, especially at the cold, dry end of the climatic spectrum. A species distribution model, Maxent, accurately predicts the major clusters of surge-type glaciers using a series of climatic and glacier geometry variables, but under-predicts clusters found outside the climatically optimal surge zone. We interpret the results in terms of a new enthalpy cycle model. Steady states require a balance between enthalpy gains generated by the balance flux and losses via heat conduction and meltwater discharge. This condition can be most easily satisfied in cold, dry environments (thin, low-flux glaciers, efficient <b>conductive</b> <b>heat</b> <b>losses)</b> and warm, humid environments (high meltwater discharges).

In this work, a new data processing procedure, which takes radiative and <b>conductive</b> <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> into consideration, is introduced, and the thermal diffusivity, a, and specific heat, cp are determined by fitting the entire experimental transient temperature curve.

40|$|This {{study of}} nitrogen-diluted non-premixed {{counterflow}} flames with finite burner diameters investigates {{the important role}} of the outer-edge flame on flame extinction through experimental and numerical analyses. It explores flame stability diagrams mapping the flame extinction response of nitrogen-diluted non-premixed counterflow flames to varying global strain rates in terms of burner diameter, burner gap, and velocity ratio. A critical nitrogen mole fraction exists beyond which the flame cannot be sustained; the critical nitrogen mole fraction versus global strain rate curves have C-shapes for various burner diameters, burner gaps, and velocity ratios. At sufficiently high strain-rate flames, these curves collapse into one curve; therefore, the flames follow the one-dimensional flame response of a typical diffusion flame. Low strain-rate flames are significantly affected by radial <b>conductive</b> <b>heat</b> <b>loss,</b> and therefore flame length. Three flame extinction modes are identified: flame extinction through shrinkage of the outer-edge flame with or without oscillations at the outer-edge flame prior to the extinction, and flame extinction through a flame hole at the flame center. The extinction modes are significantly affected by the behavior of the outer-edge flame. Detailed explanations are provided based on the measured flame-surface temperature and numerical evaluation of the fractional contribution of each term in the energy equation. Radial <b>conductive</b> <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> at the flame edge to ambience is the main mechanism of extinction through shrinkage of the outer-edge flame in low strain-rate flames. Reduction of the burner diameter can extend the flame extinction mode by shrinking the outer-edge flame in higher strain-rate flames. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|It {{is worth}} {{highlighting}} the remarkable agreement between our VLP source location at White Island and Jolly et al. (2017)’s ones in 2011 during {{a sequence of}} VLP. The depths for VLPs at Kawah Ijen interestingly fall in the same range, i.e., 700 – 900  m. Jolly et al. (2017) ascribed VLPs to repeating excitations of a stationary crack above a shallow magma storage region during strong gas flux periods. Gas escape where the magma column convection ceases; <b>conductive</b> <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> leading to crystallization of microlites and consequent increasing viscosity (Stevenson and Blake 1998). The gas can be trapped behind a ductile carapace and, hence, accumulate, until enough gas pressure is achieved {{to break through the}} carapace (Jolly et al. 2017). This ductile carapace behaves as an impermeable shell and would correspond to zones of hot and weak rock with strong V_p/V_s contrasts (and high poisson ratios) (Dawson et al. 1999). The failure of a magma carapace due to the release of fluids acts as the source of VLP; the high waveform coherence between individual VLPs in Jolly et al. (2017) indicating the repeating nature of such process. The crack generally releases gases passively, but during periods of high flux, the gas would produce discrete VLPs (Jolly et al. 2017). Under low flux conditions, the magma carapace may have sufficient permeability to allow unhindered gas migration to shallower depth. A large gas pulse, however, may exceed the confining pressure of the carapace and promote rupture within VLP source frequencies. Such conceptual model appears viable and could explain the triggering of VLPs at both volcanoes.|$|E
40|$|Building {{performance}} calculations {{often use}} deterministic simulations. Since many influencing parameters are generally inherently uncertain, this {{may lead to}} unreliable predictions of design impact and hence excessive deviations between design and reality. Such excessive deviations of building performances are usually undesirable: clients want guarantees that their investments have the desired impact. Hence, the overall aims of this research are (1) {{the development of a}} probabilistic robust design methodology to incorporate these uncertainties for building performance analysis and optimisation and (2) its illustrative application on the thermal design of comfortable and affordable robust low-energy dwellings. In the developed methodology, several design options can be compared based on the probability distributions of the studied performances. In order to do so, a multi-layered Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis is performed to subject all options to the same input uncertainties and hence calculate the corresponding performance distributions. An additional sensitivity analysis is applied to investigate which input uncertainties are most dominant for these distributions. Because this approach might be very time-consuming, the computational model is in this thesis optionally replaced by a much faster meta-model, without compromising the reliability. The methodology also enables an explicit evaluation of the design options for potential scenarios, such as the user type or economic evolutions, when desired. In order to numerically compare the probability distributions in view of the robust design principles, effectiveness and robustness indicators are introduced. Here, effectiveness is defined as the ability of the design option to optimise the performance, while robustness is defined as the ability to stabilise this performance for the entire range of input uncertainties. At the end of the thesis, the methodology is illustrated on the thermal design of comfortable and affordable robust low-energy dwellings. Although this application is simplified, general observations can be made. Most attention needs to be paid on the ventilation system and air tightness, since ventilation losses are more important than <b>conductive</b> <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> when U-values around 0. 2 W/m 2 K are applied for walls, roofs and floors.

Spatially resolved measurements (resolution {approx} 6 {micro}m) were taken across a 200 {micro}m slot-type discharge. Stark splitting {{of the hydrogen}} Balmer-line was used to investigate the electric field distribution in the cathode sheath region. Electron densities were evaluated from {{the analysis of the}} spectral line broadenings of H-{beta} emission. The electron density in the bulk plasma was in the range 3 - 8 x 1013 cm- 3. The electric field peaked at the cathode ({approx} 60 kV/cm) and decayed to small values over a distance of {approx} 50 {micro}m (sheath edge) from the cathode. These experimental data were in good agreement with a self-consistent one-dimensional model of the discharge. The dependence of gas temperature on gas flow through the slot-type, atmospheric pressure microplasma in helium or argon was investigated by a combination of experiments and modeling. Spatially-resolved gas temperature profiles across the gap between the two electrodes were obtained from rotational analysis of N{sub 2 } (C{sup 3 }II{sub u} {yields} B{sup 3 } II{sub g}) emission spectra, with small amounts of N{sub 2 } added as actinometer gas. Under the same input power of 20 kW/cm{sup 3 }, the peak gas temperature in helium ({approx} 650 K) was significantly lower than that in argon (over 1200 K). This reflects the much higher thermal conductivity of helium gas. The gas temperature decreased with increasing gas flow rate, more so in argon compared to helium. This was consistent with the fact that <b>conductive</b> <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> dominate in helium microplasmas, while convective heat losses {{play a major role in}} argon microplasmas. A plasma-gas flow simulation of the microdischarge, including a chemistry set, a compressible Navier-Stokes (and mass continuity) equation, and a convective heat transport equation, was also performed. Experimental measurements were in good agreement with simulation predictions. Finally, laser scattering experiments were performed at pressures of 100 s of Torr in argon or nitrogen. Laser Thomson Scattering (LTS) and Rotational Raman Scattering were employed in a novel, backscattering, confocal configuration. LTS allows direct and simultaneous measurement of both electron density (ne) and electron temperature (Te). For 50 mA current and over the pressure range of 300 - 700 Torr, LTS yielded Te = 0. 9 {+-} 0. 3 eV and ne = (6 {+-} 3) 1013 cm- 3, in reasonable agreement with the predictions of a mathematical model.

The underlying vacuum cavity greatly reduces <b>conductive</b> <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> to the substrate and therefore increases the sensitivity of the sensor. Testing of the sensor has been conducted in a wind-tunnel under three operation modes - constant current, constantvoltage, and constant temperature. Under the constanttemperature mode, a typical shear stress sensor exhibits a time constantof 72 #s. 1 1 Introduction The determination of wall shear stress, #,isvery important in #uid mechanics and aerodynamics studies. For example, the viscous drag experienced by an object in a #ow #eld corresponds to the integrated shear stress over the surface area. The ability of measuring the distribution o [...] ...|$|R
40|$|As a {{fundamental}} study to understand physical and chem-ical characteristics in micro-combustors, numerical simula-tions of a stagnation-point flow combustor with a catalytic sur-face are performed. One-dimensional similarity formulation is derived with full consideration of detailed surface and gas-phase chemical kinetic models. Parametric studies are con-ducted {{to investigate the}} effects of strain rate, equivalence ra-tio, <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> on the combustion and extinction modes. The steady results showed that catalysis can largely extend the extinction limit, while suppressing the gas phase reaction at lower strain rates. It was {{also found that the}} extension of the catalytic reaction quenching limit is sensitive to the mix-ture composition, suggesting the dominance of chemical as-pects in catalytic combustion. The temperature versus strain rate response curves exhibit multiple branches of stable solu-tions, implying a possibility of hysteresis behavior in a cou-pled homogeneous-heterogeneous reactor. Extensive paramet-ric studies in terms of the mixture equivalence ratio and the <b>conductive</b> <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> parameter have revealed three distinct steady response regimes. The results are expected to provide insight into improving the overall combustion stability and ef-ficiency of micro-combustors. ...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} factors {{that come into}} play when using R-values to compute <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> for a {{particular}} wall. Manufacturer R values apply only to properly installed insulation. Squashing two layers of batting into the thickness intended for one layer will increase but not double the R-value. (In other words, compressing a fiberglass batt decreases the R-value of the batt but increases the R-value per inch.) Another important factor to consider is that studs and windows provide a parallel heat conduction path that is unaffected by the insulation's R-value. The practical implication {{of this is that}} one could double the R-value of insulation installed between framing members and realize substantially less than a 50% reduction in <b>heat</b> <b>loss.</b> When installed between wall studs, even perfect wall insulation only eliminates conduction through the insulation but leaves unaffected the <b>conductive</b> <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> through such materials as glass windows and studs. Insulation installed between the studs may reduce, but usually does not eliminate, <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> due to air leakage through the building envelope. Installing a continuous layer of rigid foam insulation on the exterior side of the wall sheathing will interrupt thermal bridging through the studs while also reducing the rate of air leakage.|$|R
40|$|Theoretically- and empirically-derived cooling {{rates for}} active pāhoehoe lava flows show that surface cooling is {{controlled}} by <b>conductive</b> <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> through a crust that is thickening with the square root of time. The model {{is based on a}} linear relationship that links log(time) with surface cooling. This predictable cooling behavior can be used assess the age of recently emplaced sheet flows from their surface temperatures. Using a single thermal image, or image mosaic, this allows quantification of the variation in areal coverage rates and lava discharge rates over 48 hour periods prior to image capture. For pāhoehoe sheet flow at Kīlauea (Hawai`i) this gives coverage rates of 1 – 5 m 2 /min at discharge rates of 0. 01 – 0. 05 m 3 /s, increasing to ∼ 40 m 2 /min at 0. 4 – 0. 5 m 3 /s. Our thermal chronometry approach represents a quick and easy method of tracking flow advance over a three-day period using a single, thermal snap-shot...|$|R
