5|$|Before Christmas' escape attempt, Hightower {{delivers}} Lena's {{child in}} the cabin where Brown and Christmas had been staying before the murder, and Byron arranges for Brown/Burch to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> her. Brown deserts Lena once again, but Byron follows him and challenges him to a fight. Brown beats the braver, smaller Bunch, then skilfully hops a moving train and disappears. At {{the end of the}} story, an anonymous man is talking to his wife about two strangers he picked up on a trip to Tennessee, recounting that the woman had a child and the man was not the father. This was Lena and Byron, who were conducting a half-hearted search for Brown, and they are eventually dropped off in Tennessee.|$|E

In a second visit to disciples, he proves to a doubting disciple ("Doubting Thomas") that he is flesh and blood. The disciples return to Galilee, where Jesus makes another appearance. He performs a miracle known as the catch of 153 fish at the Sea of Galilee, after which Jesus encourages Peter to serve his followers.|$|E

5|$|At the palace, Charming {{struggles with}} his {{feelings}} for Snow. The King (Alan Dale) commands him to forget her because the marriage to Abigail is worth great wealth to the kingdom. Charming sends a letter by carrier pigeon to Snow begging her to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> him {{so they can}} be together. The letter reaches her just before she can take the potion. Snow makes it to the palace but she is seized by the guards and thrown into the dungeon. There she meets a dwarf named Grumpy (Lee Arenberg), who was falsely imprisoned for stealing a diamond that he wanted to give to his girlfriend. Another dwarf, Stealthy (Geoff Gustafson), shows up to rescue Grumpy, who asks Stealthy to free Snow as well. The guards kill Stealthy as they try to escape and try to recapture Grumpy. Snow threatens to burn down the palace unless they let Grumpy go and take her in his place. The King tells Snow he will not let her interfere with the wedding. She must tell Charming she does not love him, or the King will kill him. Snow obeys because she loves Charming too much to let him die, but both are left heartbroken. Snow leaves and is soon joined by Grumpy and six other dwarfs, who offer her a place to stay. She considers the potion but Grumpy warns her that those feelings however painful, are part of her. Charming calls off the wedding to look for Snow and the dwarves hear about it from Red Riding Hood. Grumpy joyfully tells Snow the good news, but she has forgotten about Charming. The pain was too great to bear and she drank the potion.|$|E

25|$|Natalie Bassingthwaighte {{was born}} on 1 September 1975 in Wollongong, New South Wales to Betty (born ca. 1953) and Michael Bassingthwaighte (AM) (born ca. 1952). Betty {{has worked as a}} theatre nurse, beauty {{therapist}} and hairdresser. Since 1982 Michael has worked as the CEO of a health care insurance provider. Bassingthwaighte grew up in the suburb of Mount Warrigal as the second of four girls with her older sister Melinda (born ca. 1974) and the twins, Lisa and Nicole (born ca. 1982). From a young age, she used to charge 20 cents for family and friends to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> her dress up and put on mini concerts. Bassingthwaighte got her first role in a primary school production at Balarang Primary School of Peter Pan, playing the character Tinker Bell. She enrolled at Wollongong High School of the Performing Arts and graduated from the Australian College of Entertainment.|$|E
25|$|The {{tourists}} {{arrived in}} Fremantle on 7 October and Cowdrey learnt by telegram {{that his father}} had died, but he decided to continue the tour. Four days later played their first match of a long tour against a local Country XI on a small, sandy ground 20 yards from the beach. The A.C.B. liked these games as they encouraged grassroots cricket. They were less popular with the tourists as they involved travelling to distant grounds to play in front of small crowds. However, one or two of these games were useful {{at the beginning of the}} tour to allow the players to warm up and Bunbury was close enough to Fremantle and Perth for hundreds to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> the game. The Country teams could sometime surprise the opposition, and this team included three first-class players, including spinners Morgan Herbert and Eric James, both players for Tambellup–Cranbrook. Hutton won the toss and the MCC belted 344/5 in less than a day with Hutton (59), Edrich (129), Graveney (58) and Cowdrey (48 not out) entertaining the crowd. A declaration before stumps saw no Country wickets fall and 51 was added for the first wicket, but then Big Jim McConnon's off-spin worked its way through the middle order as he took 5/30 after Peter Loader (4/35) and Tyson (1/35) removed the openers and the home side were all out for 116. Put back in again they survived the day, and the match, at 128/6 with Colin Cowdrey's good natured leg-spin taking 4/35. Tyson ploughed up the sand on his long run up and could not bowl at full pace and was described by one reporter as a zephyr rather than a typhoon.|$|E

25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

500|$|Alexander Derek Dougan {{was born}} in Belfast on 20 January 1938, the son of Jackie and Josie Dougan. His father worked at Belfast docks. His grandfather, Sandy, had played at half-back for Linfield, and two of Sandy's {{brothers}} also played {{for some of the}} leading clubs in Belfast. As a child, Dougan would usually spend between four and eight hours a day playing football in the street. His family were poor, and later in life Dougan joked that [...] "on the street where I lived, if you paid your rent three weeks on the trot, the police used to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> where you got the money from". As a teenager he spent 18 months working at a toy factory whilst playing amateur football for Cregagh Boys. He also trained with Linfield, but could not break into any of their junior teams. He instead joined Distillery in 1953. Manager Jimmy McIntosh handed him his first team debut on 5 February 1955, in a 0–0 Irish Cup first [...] round draw with Glentoran. Maurice Tadman, who succeeded McIntosh as the club's manager in the summer of 1955, preferred to use Dougan as a target man centre-forward, as Dougan's height made him adept at winning and flicking on headers in the opposition penalty area.|$|E
500|$|According to Karim biographer Sushila Anand, the Queen's own letters {{testify that}} [...] "her {{discussions with the}} Munshi were wide-ranging—philosophical, {{political}} and practical. [...] Both head and heart were engaged. [...] There {{is no doubt that}} the Queen found in Abdul Karim a connection with a world that was fascinatingly alien, and a confidant who would not feed her the official line." [...] Karim was placed in charge of the other Indian servants and made responsible for their accounts. Victoria praised him in her letters and journal. [...] "I am so very fond of him" [...] she wrote, [...] "He is so good & gentle & understanding all I want & is a real comfort to me." [...] She admired [...] "her personal Indian clerk & Munshi, who is an excellent, clever, truly pous & very refined gentle man, who says, 'God ordered it'... God's Orders is what they implicitly obey! Such faith as theirs & such conscientiousness set us a gt. example." [...] At Balmoral Castle, the Queen's Scottish estate, Karim was allocated the room previously occupied by John Brown, a favourite servant of the Queen's who had died in 1883. Despite the serious and dignified manner that Karim presented to the outside world, the Queen wrote that [...] "he is very friendly and cheerful with the Queen's maids and laughs and even jokes now—and invited them to <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> all his fine things offering them fruit cake to eat".|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of Otello Verdi commented, [...] "After having relentlessly massacred so many heroes and heroines, I have at last the right to laugh a little." [...] He had {{considered}} a variety of comic subjects but had found none of them wholly suitable and confided his ambition to Boito. The librettist said nothing at the time but secretly began work on a libretto based on The Merry Wives of Windsor with additional material taken from Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2. Verdi received the draft libretto probably in early July 1889 after he had just read Shakespeare's play: [...] "Benissimo! Benissimo!... No one could have done better than you", he wrote back to Boito. But he still had doubts: his age, his health (which he admits to being good) {{and his ability to}} complete the project: [...] "If I were not to finish the music?". If the project failed, {{it would have been a}} waste of Boito's time, and have distracted him from completing his own new opera. Finally on 10 July 1889 he wrote again: [...] "So be it! So let's do Falstaff! For now, let's not think of obstacles, of age, of illnesses!" [...] Verdi emphasised the need for secrecy, but continued [...] "If you are in the mood, then start to write." [...] Later he wrote to Boito (capitals and exclamation marks are Verdi's own): [...] "What joy to be able to say to the public: HERE WE ARE AGAIN!!! <b>COME</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SEE</b> US!" ...|$|E
