25|$|The {{earliest}} royal heraldic badge is a {{sprig of}} <b>common</b> <b>broom,</b> {{said to have}} been worn by Geoffrey of Anjou in his cap. The broom plant or Plantegenest (planta genista in medieval Latin), thus became Geoffrey's nickname; 'Plantagenet'. The heraldic device also became the name of the dynasty that was borne from him, which was to rule England for over 300 years. The Plantagenet kings would use this badge, sometimes combining it with other more personal devices. King Henry II used the 'planta genista' as well as an escarbuncle. King Richard I used a star and crescent device, which was also adopted by his brother King John. King Henry III adopted the broom sprig and the star and crescent. His son Edward I in addition to these, added the golden rose device that he inherited from his mother Eleanor of Provence. King Edward II further added the golden castle of Castile, inherited from his mother Eleanor of Castile.|$|E
500|$|Richard of York adopted [...] "Plantagenet" [...] as {{a family}} name {{for himself and his}} {{descendants}} during the 15th century. Plantegenest (or Plante Genest) was Geoffrey's nickname, and his emblem may have been the <b>common</b> <b>broom</b> (planta genista in medieval Latin). It is uncertain why Richard chose the name, but it emphasised Richard's hierarchal status as Geoffrey's (and six English kings') patrilineal descendant during the Wars of the Roses. The retrospective use of the name for Geoffrey's male descendants was popular during the Tudor period, perhaps encouraged by the added legitimacy it gave Richard's great-grandson Henry VIII of England.|$|E

500|$|Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, adopted Plantagenet as {{his family}} {{name in the}} 15th century. [...] "Plantegenest" [...] (or [...] "Plante Genest") had been a 12th-century {{nickname}} for his ancestor Geoffrey, Count of Anjou and Duke of Normandy.

It is uncertain why Richard chose this specific name, although during the Wars of the Roses it emphasised Richard's status as Geoffrey's patrilineal descendant. The retrospective usage of the name for all of Geoffrey's male descendants was popular during the subsequent Tudor dynasty, perhaps encouraged by the further legitimacy it gave to Richard's great-grandson, Henry VIII. It was only in the late 17th century that it passed into common usage among historians.|$|E
500|$|Kersal Moor {{is one of}} {{the many}} fluvioglacial ridges that formed along the Irwell Valley during the melting of the glaciers at the end of the last ice age. Typically for this type of landform, the subsoil is {{composed}} of sand mixed with coarse gravel. The 19th century botanist Richard Buxton described this as [...] "Mr. E.W. Binney's drift deposit no.2... a deposit of sharp forest sand, parted with layers of gravel composed of Azoic, Palaeozoic and Triassic rocks, well rounded, parted with layers of fine sand, and having every appearance of a regular deposit by water." [...] This deposit is overlaid with a thin topsoil supporting a range of mosses, heathers, grasses, ferns, <b>common</b> <b>broom,</b> gorse and some trees, which are predominantly oak with some rowan, cherry and other broadleaved species. The land to the south is elevated, rising to a high point towards the south-west. From this elevated position there are views across Manchester to the Derbyshire hills in the south, to the Pennines in the north east and across the Irwell Valley and Salford in the west. The land falls away to the north, ending with two drumlin-shaped hills on the northern edge, which were probably formed by sediment from the meltwater of the receding glaciers, in a process known as sedimentary fluting. The moor is criss-crossed with footpaths, many of which cut through to the sand and gravel below. Singleton Brook, to the north of the moor, denotes the boundary between Salford and Prestwich.|$|E

60|$|Bees incessantly {{visit the}} flowers of the <b>common</b> <b>Broom,</b> {{and these are}} adapted by a curious {{mechanism}} for cross-fertilisation. When a bee alights on the wing-petals of a young flower, the keel is slightly opened and the short stamens spring out, which rub their pollen against the abdomen of the bee. If a rather older flower is visited {{for the first time}} (or if the bee exerts great force on a younger flower), the keel opens along its whole length, and the longer as well as the shorter stamens, together with the much elongated curved pistil, spring forth with violence. The flattened, spoon-like extremity of the pistil rests for a time {{on the back of the}} bee, and leaves on it the load of pollen with which it is charged. As soon as the bee flies away, the pistil instantly curls round, so that the stigmatic surface is now upturned and occupies a position, in which it would be rubbed against the abdomen of another bee visiting the same flower. Thus, when the pistil first escapes from the keel, the stigma is rubbed against the back of the bee, dusted with pollen from the longer stamens, either of the same or another flower; and afterwards against the lower surface of the bee dusted with pollen from the shorter stamens, which is often shed a day or two before that from the longer stamens. (5/16. These observations have been quoted in an abbreviated form by the Reverend G. Henslow, in the 'Journal of Linnean Society Botany' volume 9 1866 page 358. Hermann Muller has since published a full and excellent account of the flower in his 'Befruchtung' etc. page 240.) By this mechanism cross-fertilisation is rendered almost inevitable, and we shall immediately see that pollen from a distinct plant is more effective than that from the same flower. I need only add that, according to H. Muller, the flowers do not secrete nectar, and he thinks that bees insert their proboscides only in the hope of finding nectar; but they act in this manner so frequently and for so long a time that I cannot avoid the belief that they obtain something palatable within the flowers.|$|E

50|$|It {{is related}} to the <b>common</b> <b>broom</b> and Spanish broom. This suite of plants is common in European shrublands.
