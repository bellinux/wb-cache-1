500|$|The album's earlier {{sessions}} {{produced a}} little material {{that has made}} the final cut. West had brought a majority of his usual production crew onto the project, the same crew that had assisted in the creation of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. One of the main exceptions was producer No I.D., who felt that the two artists weren't pushing forward enough with the music. In an interview with Complex, No I.D. commented about the project that [...] "you're going to sell, because you're already big. But you guys are important to push this forward. Push intelligence and decadence and all of the above forward in a creative manner." [...] While his advice was acknowledged to a degree, he ultimately had very little part in the finished project. In January 2011, they regrouped and rented a block of rooms at the Mercer Hotel in New York City and invited a select group of producers and recording artists. Chauncey [...] "Hit-Boy" [...] Hollis, who produced the track [...] "Niggas in Paris", said of recording at the hotel, [...] "There was music going on in every room. I had a room where I was cranking out beats, and then I'd go into the main room with Jay and [...] and play beats for them. Kanye is really hands-on. I would <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> beat and he'd be like, 'Take this out, slow it down.' It would make it sound 100 times better. Jay would then mumble different flows to the beat".|$|E

[...] "There {{comes a time when}} a series needs new input," [...] she told Doctor Who Magazine thirty years later. [...] "It's not that I wasn't fond of Doctor Who, I simply felt that the time had come. It had been eighteen very concentrated months, something like seventy shows. I know people do soaps forever now, but I felt Doctor Who needed someone to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> different view." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Chiefs' {{loss to the}} New York Jets in the 2007 season finale, Chiefs {{general manager}} Carl Peterson {{announced}} that both he and head coach Herm Edwards {{would return to the}} Chiefs in 2008. However, Hunt declined to immediately comment on Peterson's status. Hunt spoke out weeks later and stated that the Chiefs were his [...] "No. 1 priority" [...] and that [...] "to have the best chance of success in 2008, having Carl here makes a lot of sense." [...] Hunt wanted to avoid having a new general manager <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new head coach, and starting from scratch again.|$|E

2500|$|They {{began working}} more quickly on {{material}} then they ever had. [...] "We write songs in like five minutes now," [...] Maida {{said at the}} time, [...] "The energy's there." [...] For the first time, Mazur {{was included in the}} songwriting process, having not been in the band yet while Gravity was being written. [...] "On this record we really tried to write together," [...] Maida says. [...] "It’s easy for me to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> song, say here it is, lets go record it and it’ll be done in a couple of days. But when you have to sit in your rehearsal hall and you wait for that magic to happen, well, it doesn’t always happen right away, but that was the M.O. for this record and it worked." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the Chiefs {{loss to the}} New York Jets in the 2007 season finale, {{general manager}} Carl Peterson {{announced}} that both he and head coach Herman Edwards {{would return to the}} Chiefs in 2008. However, team chairman Clark Hunt—who took over leadership of the Chiefs in late 2006 {{after the death of his}} father, team founder Lamar Hunt—declined to immediately comment on Peterson's status. Hunt spoke out weeks later and stated that the Chiefs were his [...] "No. 1 priority" [...] and that [...] "to have the best chance of success in 2008, having Carl here makes a lot of sense.” Hunt wanted to avoid having a new general manager <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new head coach, and starting from scratch again. Edwards and Peterson were considered to be on the hot seat by the press, but inside the team, both were considered to be safe unless absolutely zero progress was made in 2008. Clark Hunt had expressed his expectations of a winning Chiefs team earning a playoff berth in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Quan Chi made a brief {{appearance}} in the eighth episode of the 2011 web series , at the climax of a two-parter featuring Sub-Zero and Scorpion. Bi-Han (Sub-Zero) has fatally stabbed Hanzo Hasashi (Scorpion) just as Hanzo discovers that his family has been slain by whom he believes are the Lin Kuei, but Bi-Han is actually Quan Chi, who changes back to his original form and resurrects Hanzo as an undead specter, promising him revenge against Sub-Zero {{in exchange for his}} services. Quan Chi was played by Michael Rogers, who had originally auditioned for Kabal but was brought back for the part of Quan Chi after plans for including Kabal in the series were scrapped. Rogers enthused in a 2011 interview that he [...] "absolutely loved the role" [...] despite not having played the games, but once he got the part he avoided any kind of MK media aside from the 2010 short film , because he [...] "did not want any influences and wanted to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fresh perspective" [...] on the character.|$|E
