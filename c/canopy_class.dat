40|$|In {{this work}} was made the {{classification}} of land cover {{in an area of}} Caxiuanã National Forest, Pará State, based on satellite imagery using a supervised approach by regions. It was started with a fit between the means and variances of the bands, followed by application of median filter. Subsequently, it was proceeded to image segmentation by region growing. The next step was to define the classes of coverage and the selection of training samples. Finally, the image classification was done. It was extracted information from elevation and slope to the generated classes. As a result, it was found that in the studied area predominates the Upland Forest - Heterogeneous <b>Canopy</b> <b>class</b> (67. 6 %), and that together with the Upland Forest - Homogeneous <b>Canopy</b> <b>class</b> (8. 3 %), occupy the higher areas (? 46 m). The areas of Upland Forest - Hill (8. 0 %) and Secondary Vegetation (1. 6 %) classes are in intermediate altimetric position (? 42 m). Finally, the Floodplain Forest class (12. 0 %) occupies a lower altimetric position (? 39 m). About 80 % of the area is on gently undulating relief. The Upland Forest - Canopy Heterogeneous and Upland Forest - Homogeneous Canopy classes differ in slope terms but not in elevation terms. It is believed that phytosociological studies (structure and/or floristic) showing differences between these classes. Realizou-se a classificação da cobertura da terra em uma área da Flona de Caxiuanã, com base em imagens de satélite, utilizando uma abordagem supervisionada por regiões. Iniciou-se com um ajuste entre as médias e variâncias das bandas, seguido pela aplicação do filtro mediana. Procedeu-se a segmentação da imagem por crescimento de regiões. Definiram-se as classes de cobertura e selecionaram-se amostras de treinamento. Classificou-se a imagem. Foram extraídas informações de elevação e declividade para as classes geradas. Como resultado, verificou-se que na área predomina a classe Floresta de Terra Firme - Dossel Heterogêneo (67, 6 %), que juntamente com a classe Floresta de Terra Firme - Dossel Homogêneo (8, 3 %), ocupam as áreas mais elevadas (? 46 m). As classes Floresta de Terra Firme - Encosta (8, 0 %) e Vegetação Secundária (1, 6 %) estão numa posição altimétrica intermediária (? 42 m). A classe Floresta de Várzea (12, 0 %) ocupa uma posição altimétrica mais baixa (? 39 m). Cerca de 80 % da área está em relevo suave ondulado. As classes Floresta de Terra Firme - Dossel Heterogêneo e Floresta de Terra Firme - Dossel Homogêneo diferem-se em termos de declividade, mas não em termos de elevação. Acredita-se que os estudos fitossociológicos (estrutura e/ou florística), mostrem diferenças entre estas classes...|$|E
40|$|Reduced-impact logging (RIL) and {{conventional}} techniques (CNV) were compared in a mixed dipterocarp hill forest in East Kalimantan in three blocks of about 100 ha each. Damage was evaluated using pre- and post-harvesting assessments in 24 one-hectare sample plots. RIL techniques nearly halved {{the number of}} trees destroyed (36 vs 60 trees/ha). RIL's main benefit was in the reduction of skidding damage (9, 5 % of the original tree population in RIL vs 25 % in CNV). Before logging, mean canopy openness in CNV (three plots only) and RIL (9 plots) was similar. After logging, the mean canopy openness was 19. 2 % in CNV and 13. 3 % in RIL, and he distribution of the <b>canopy</b> <b>class</b> in RIL and CNV significantly different. CNV plots showed {{a higher proportion of}} measurements in the most open class than in RIL In mixed dipterocarp forest where harvestable timber density generally exceeds 10 trees/ha, a minimum diameter felling limit is clearly insufficient to keep extraction rates below 8 trees/ha. Based on these new results and previous studies in Borneo, the authors suggest three silvicultural rules: (1) to keep a minimum distance between stumps of ca. 40 m, (2) to ensure only single tree gaps using directional felling, (3) to harvest only stems with 60 - 100 cm dbh.

Each geotype group was characterized by the high similarity among the predominant type of canopy, reflecting common physical, spatial and ecological characteristics. Geotypes near to Serra do Mar low slope showed a predominance of high vegetation, compared with the group of coastal plain geotypes, especially influenced by the soil saturation with water (among other factors), that affects the fall of high trees. The third group is the nearest to the coastal line, a highly influenced area by human presence and by marine dynamics.

In this paper, the tree canopy cover percentage of a savannah-like ecosystem (montado/dehesa) was estimated at Landsat pixel level for 2011, and the role of different canopy cover percentages on land surface albedo (LSA) and land surface temperature (LST) were analysed. A modelling procedure using a SGB machine-learning algorithm and Landsat 5 -TM spectral bands and derived vegetation indices as explanatory variables, showed that the estimation of montado canopy cover was obtained with good agreement (R 2 = 78. 4 %). Overall, montado canopy cover estimations showed that low <b>canopy</b> cover <b>class</b> (MT_ 1) is the most representative with 50. 63 % of total montado area. MODIS LSA and LST products were used to investigate the magnitude of differences in mean annual LSA and LST values between contrasting montado canopy cover percentages. As a result, it was found a significant statistical relationship between montado canopy cover percentage and mean annual surface albedo (R 2 = 0. 866, p < 0. 001) and surface temperature (R 2 = 0. 942, p < 0. 001). The comparisons between the four contrasting montado <b>canopy</b> cover <b>classes</b> showed marked differences in LSA (χ 2 = 192. 17, df = 3, p < 0. 001) and LST (χ 2 = 318. 18, df = 3, p < 0. 001). The highest montado canopy cover percentage (MT_ 4) generally had lower albedo than lowest <b>canopy</b> cover <b>class,</b> presenting a difference of − 11. 2 % in mean annual albedo values. It was also showed that MT_ 4 and MT_ 3 are the cooler <b>canopy</b> cover <b>classes,</b> and MT_ 2 and MT_ 1 the warmer, where MT_ 1 class had a difference of 3. 42 °C compared with MT_ 4 class. Overall, this research highlighted the role that potential changes in montado canopy cover may play in local land surface albedo and temperature variations, as an increase in these two biogeophysical parameters may potentially bring about, in the long term, local/regional climatic changes moving towards greater aridity...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{order to}} {{understanding}} {{the impact of the}} selective removal of trees from a tropical rainforest on the rate of wet-canopy evaporation for an area of lowland dipterocarp forest, selectively-logged some eight years prior to the study, a network of 450 throughfall gauges, plus 22 gross rainfall and 40 stemflow gauges, was installed within the 44 hectare Baru Experimental Catchment (Sabah, Malaysian Borneo). Most of these gauges were located randomly within plots, themselves stratified according to the six <b>canopy</b> <b>classes</b> identified. The results showed that more rainfall reached the forest floor beneath the undisturbed remnants of rainforest (i. e., the protected areas), than those patches of canopy subject to light or heavy impact. This may have been because the disturbed forest patches had a higher rate of wet-canopy evaporation (i. e., 12 - 18 % of gross rainfall) in comparison to the undisturbed remnants (i. e., 7 % of gross rainfall). Alternatively, the difference may, at least in part, have been caused by the lower disturbed patches of vegetation being sheltered by the undisturbed forest remnants, leading to the receipt of less rainfall on their canopy surfaces...|$|R

Canopy cover was quan-tified using total obstruction, size of largest opening and fragmentation of sky view. At sites with no canopy above 2 m, a mean precision of 1. 5 m was recorded. Where canopy was present, precision ranged between 2. 6 m and 2. 8 m. The {{results indicated that}} in dynamic mode, differences in DGPS performance between canopy cover types were limited to a presence/absence effect. Loss of 3 -dimensional operation (i. e. only 3 satellites in view) occurred more fre-quently than loss of differential correction signal and thus had {{a greater impact on}} recorded precision over the dura-tion of the experiment. It was concluded from the data collected that the most versatile approach when using dynamic DGPS is to collect more (potentially poorer qual-ity) data, rather than to apply a filter at the signal acquisi-tion stage.

Ground truth consisted of a photointerpreted determination of percent canopy closure of 0 to 100 percent for 32 sites. The sites selected were situated on plateaus at an elevation of approximately 3 km with slope or = 10 percent. The predominant tree species were ponderosa pine and aspen.

40|$|AbstractInvasive {{woody plant}} {{expansion}} {{is a primary}} threat driving fragmentation and loss of sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) and prairie habitats across the central and western United States. Expansion of native woody plants, including conifer (primarily Juniperus spp.) and mesquite (Prosopis spp.), {{over the past century}} is primarily attributable to wildfire suppression, historic periods of intensive livestock grazing, and changes in climate. To guide successful conservation programs aimed at reducing top-down stressors, we mapped invasive woody plants at regional scales to evaluate landscape level impacts, target restoration actions, and monitor restoration outcomes. Our overarching goal was to produce seamless regional products across sociopolitical boundaries with resolution fine enough to depict the spatial extent and degree of woody plant invasion relevant to greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) conservation efforts. We mapped tree canopy cover at 1 -m spatial resolution across an 11 -state region (508 265 km 2). Greater than 90 % of occupied lesser prairie-chicken habitat was largely treeless for conifers (67 % was treeless for mesquite. Conifers in the higher <b>canopy</b> cover <b>classes</b> (16 − 50 % and > 50 % canopy cover) were scarce (50 %; x− = 6, SE = 2 %). Mapping indicated that a high proportion of invading woody plants are at a low to intermediate level.

The goals {{of this study were}} to quantify the overall rates of pinyon-juniper expansion over the past 3 decades, and determine the landscape factors influencing patterns of expansion in central Nevada. Aerial panchromatic photos (1966 - 1995) were used,to quantify changing distribution of pinyon-juniper woodland, over multiple spatial scales (0. 002 -, 0. 02 -, and 0. 4 -ha median patch sizes), and for discrete categories of elevation, slope aspect, slope steepness, hillslope position, and prior <b>canopy</b> cover <b>class.</b> An object-oriented multiscale segmentation and classification scheme, based on attributes of brightness, shape, homogeneity, and texture, was applied to classify vegetation. Over the 30 -year period, the area of woodland has increased by 11 % over coarse, ecotonal scales (0. 4 -ha scale) but by 33 % over single-tree scales (20 -m(2) scale). Woodland expansion has been dominated by infilling processes Where small tree patches have established in openings between larger, denser patches. Infilling rates have been greatest at lower elevations, whereas migration of the woodland belt over coarser scales has proceeded in both upslope and downslope directions. Increases in woodland area were several times greater where terrain variables indicated more mesic conditions. Management treatments involving removal of trees should be viewed in a long-term context, because tree invasion is likely to proceed rapidly on productive sites...|$|R
40|$|Studies have {{demonstrated}} the robust performance of the ensemble machine learning classifier, random forests, for remote sensing land cover classification, particularly across complex landscapes. This study introduces new ensemble margin criteria to evaluate the performance of Random Forests (RF) {{in the context of}} large area land cover classification and examines the effect of different training data characteristics (imbalance and mislabelling) on classification accuracy and uncertainty. The study presents a new margin weighted confusion matrix, which used in combination with the traditional confusion matrix, provides confidence estimates associated with correctly and misclassified instances in the RF classification model. Landsat TM satellite imagery, topographic and climate ancillary data are used to build binary (forest/non-forest) and multiclass (forest <b>canopy</b> cover <b>classes)</b> classification models, trained using sample aerial photograph maps, across Victoria, Australia. Experiments were undertaken to reveal insights into the behaviour of RF over large and complex data, in which training data are not evenly distributed among classes (imbalance) and contain systematically mislabelled instances. Results of experiments reveal that while the error rate of the RF classifier is relatively insensitive to mislabelled training data (in the multiclass experiment, overall 78. 3 % Kappa with no mislabelled instances to 70. 1 % with 25 % mislabelling in each class), the level of associated confidence falls at a faster rate than overall accuracy with increasing amounts of mislabelled training data. In general, balanced training data resulted in the lowest overall error rates for classification experiments (82. 3 % and 78. 3 % for the binary and multiclass experiments respectively). However, results of the study demonstrate that imbalance can be introduced to improve error rates of more difficult classes, without adversely affecting overall classification accuracy...|$|R

While aware of such inherent error, scientists often proceed with analyses that assume exact locations. The results of such analyses then represent one realization in a distribution of possible outcomes. Evaluating results {{within the context}} of that distribution can strengthen or weaken our confidence in conclusions drawn from the analysis in question. We evaluated the habitat-specific positional error of stationary GPS collars placed under a range of vegetation conditions that produced a gradient of canopy cover. We explored how variation of positional error in different vegetation cover types affects a researcher’s ability to discern scales of movement in analyses of first-passage time for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We placed 11 GPS collars in 4 different vegetative canopy cover types classified as the proportion of cover above the collar (0 – 25 %, 26 – 50 %, 51 – 75 %, and 76 – 100 %). We simulated the effect of positional error on individual movement paths using cover-specific error distributions at each location. The different cover classes did not introduce any directional bias in positional observations (1 m#mean# 6. 51 m, 0. 24 #p# 0. 47), but the standard deviation of positional error of fixes increased significantly with increasing <b>canopy</b> cover <b>class</b> for the 0 – 25 %, 26 – 50 %, 51 – 75 % classes (SD = 2. 18 m, 3. 07 m, and 4. 61 m, respectively) and then leveled off in the 76 – 100 % cover class (SD = 4. 43 m).

40|$|AbstractIn {{sagebrush}} (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems, encroachment of pinyon (Pinus spp.) and juniper (Juniperus spp.; hereafter, “pinyon-juniper”) trees {{has increased}} dramatically since European settlement. Understanding the impacts of this encroachment on behavioral decisions, distributions, and population dynamics of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and other sagebrush obligate species could help benefit sagebrush ecosystem management actions. We employed a novel two-stage Bayesian model that linked avoidance across different levels of pinyon-juniper cover to sage-grouse survival. Our analysis relied on extensive telemetry data collected across 6 yr and seven subpopulations within the Bi-State Distinct Population Segment (DPS), {{on the border of}} Nevada and California. The first model stage indicated avoidance behavior for all <b>canopy</b> cover <b>classes</b> on average, but individual grouse exhibited a high degree of heterogeneity in avoidance behavior of the lowest cover class (e. g., scattered isolated trees). The second stage modeled survival as a function of estimated avoidance parameters and indicated increased survival rates for individuals that exhibited avoidance of the lowest cover class. A post hoc frailty analysis revealed the greatest increase in hazard (i. e., mortality risk) occurred in areas with scattered isolated trees consisting of relatively high primary plant productivity. Collectively, these results provide clear evidence that local sage-grouse distributions and demographic rates are influenced by pinyon-juniper, especially in habitats with higher primary productivity but relatively low and seemingly benign tree cover. Such areas may function as ecological traps that convey attractive resources but adversely affect population vital rates. To increase sage-grouse survival, our model predictions support reducing actual pinyon-juniper cover as low as 1. 5 %, which is lower than the published target of 4. 0 %. These results may represent effects of pinyon-juniper cover in areas with similar ecological conditions to those of the Bi-State DPS, where populations occur at relatively high elevations and pinyon-juniper is abundant and widespread...|$|R

The isolated trees which were sampled were stratified based on the woody species and canopy volume intensity into three classes namely dense, medium and sparse. Species composition, abundance, species diversity (Hâ€™), richness (S) and evenness (E), density per unit area were studied as vegetation attributes. Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), pH and moisture content (MC) data were recorded as environmental variables. Totals of 26 and 7 herbaceous plant species were recorded under isolated trees and their adjacent grassland and clumps of trees respectively. Canopy zones of tree clumps and large B. spiciformis isolated trees were dominated by C. dactylon, while those of P. curatellifolia were dominated by E. indica. The most common species found in the open grasslands adjacent to both tree species, in descending order of abundance are S. pyramidalis, H. filipendula, H. dissoluta, and H. contortus. More distinct effects on herbaceous plants and soils were recorded under large isolated trees and tree clumps. Sites close to the tree trunks had more evenly distributed plant species, low species richness and low species diversity, high N, P, K, pH and MC compared to open grassland sites. Significant differences (ANOVA, P< 0. 05) amongst <b>canopy</b> volume <b>classes</b> and sampling sites were recorded in vegetation and environmental attributes for both woody speciesâ€™ isolated trees.

Structurally, herbaceous layer was unistratal, sparse and flat while open grassland was bistratal, dense and moderate in height.

The ability to efficiently and explicitly infer canopy parameters at high resolution {{is crucial to}} improve the success of large scale applications of snow water resources modeling within these areas. In this paper, the utility of estimating leaf area index (LAI), canopy closure (CC) and below canopy potential incoming solar radiation (PISR) from synthetic hemispheric photos derived from airborne LiDAR data was evaluated. LAI and CC estimates from the synthetic LiDAR images were directly compared to actual hemispherical photos taken at 16 points at 7 field areas with heterogeneous canopy stand characteristics {{for a total of}} 112 photo comparison points. The synthetic data was further analyzed against LAI and CC derived from more traditional aerial LiDAR methods using a Cartesian space which integrates values over an area rather than a point based angular viewpoint. Furthermore, the PISR estimates were directly compared to in-situ radiometer measurements taken at 30 different locations during clear sky conditions with heterogeneous canopy stand properties. When compared to the actual hemispherical photos, the CC and LAI metrics from synthetic images showed higher correlations and lower biases for all <b>canopy</b> coverage <b>classes</b> (r: 0. 93 for CC and r: 0. 83 for LAI) than the metrics from the Cartesian approach which displayed decreased correlations and higher biases with increasing canopy closure.

We use a generalized linear model (GLM) framework to allow interspecific comparisons of crown exposure that control for stem-size. For each species, a multinomial response model is used to describe the probabilities of the relative <b>canopy</b> illumination <b>classes</b> as a function of stem diameter. In general, and for all larger stems, canopy-exposure increases with diameter. Five species have size-related exposure patterns that reveal local minima above 5 cm d. b. h., but only one, Panda oleosa, shows a local maximum at a low diameter. The pattern of species exposures at 10 cm diameter is consistent with two overlapping groups, of which the smaller (21 species, including most pioneers) is generally better exposed. Relative illumination rankings amongst species are significantly maintained over a wide range of stem sizes. Species that are well exposed at small diameters are therefore also more likely to be well exposed at larger diameters, although two species in the most exposed 25 % of species at 10 cm d. b. h. drop to the lowest illumination quartile at 40 cm d. b. h., and three demonstrate the opposite (low-to-high) pattern. Species capable of achieving the largest diameters are generally recorded less frequently in shade than are smaller species, even when compared as saplings, suggesting that species achieving large mature sizes are generally shade intolerant when small. Controlling for phylogeny reveals that this relationship holds across independent lineages. We also find evidence that the range of strategies encountered is influenced by disturbance regimes. We interpret our results as indicating a continuum of strategies that reflect an evolutionary trade-off between a species mature size and its general shade-tolerance, in combination with differentiation based on disturbance based opportunities. Species that appear similar can therefore remain ecologically distinct over their lifetimes...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} development and testing of a method for estimating cattle carrying capacities. A series of studies were conducted in developing this method. Range site and vegetation production data were grouped by topographic position and multiple linear regression equations were calculated for predicting vegetation production as a site deviated from the average case of a given range site. Overstory-understory relationships from the literature were adapted into overstory <b>canopy</b> cover <b>classes</b> for predicting understory production and tested on a variety of range sites. Use of these classes produced understory biomass estimates within 13 % of measured biomass. Range condition class and understory aspect dominance by forage vs. non-forage species were investigated as estimators of forage value of the understory vegetation. Both were significantly related to amount of forage in the understory. However, understory aspect proved to be a better estimator when individual comparisons were examined. The previous findings, along with Soil Conservation Service range site guides, were used to calculate resource value ratings. Adjustment factors to be applied to the resource value ratings were calculated, using data from the literature, to account for the effects of slope and distance from water on forage utilization by cattle. These resource value ratings and adjustment factors form the basis of the carrying capacity estimation method. Pastures identified as properly utilized were used in testing the method developed. Pastures were mapped for range site, vegetation, slope and water location. Maps were converted to digital form and analyzed using the Map Analysis Package (MAP) computer program (Tomlin, 1975). Construction of a final range site-vegetation-slope-distance from water map, assigning of resource value ratings and adjustment factors, and computation of final carrying capacity estimates were accomplished using MAP. Carrying capacity estimates from the developed method were well correlated to estimates from ocular reconnaissance and area allowable use methods, r =. 87 and. 97, respectively, and with the actual use (perceived proper use), r =. 95. These estimates were accomplished without intensive field sampling.

Species that are well exposed at small diameters are therefore also more likely to be well exposed at larger diameters, although two species in the most exposed 25 % of species at 10 cm d. b. h. drop to the lowest illumination quartile at 40 cm d. b. h., and three demonstrate the opposite (low-to-high) pattern. 6 Species capable of achieving the largest diameters are generally recorded less frequently in shade than are smaller species, even when compared as saplings, suggesting that species achieving large mature sizes are generally shade intolerant when small. Controlling for phylogeny reveals that this relationship holds across independent lineages. 7 We also find evidence that the range of strategies encountered is influenced by disturbance regimes. 8 We interpret our results as indicating a continuum of strategies that reflect an evolutionary trade-off between a species’ mature size and its general shade-tolerance, in combination with differentiation based on disturbance based opportunities. Species that appear similar can therefore remain ecologically distinct over their lifetimes...|$|R

The objectives of this multi-layer, multi-source database are two fold: first, to provide consistent land cover for all 50 States, and second, to provide a data framework which allows flexibility in developing and applying each independent data component {{to a wide variety}} of other applications. Components in the database include the following: (1) normalized imagery for three time periods per path/row, (2) ancillary data, including a 30 m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived into slope, aspect and slope position, (3) perpixel estimates of percent imperviousness and percent tree <b>canopy,</b> (4) 29 <b>classes</b> of land cover data derived from the imagery, ancillary data, and derivatives, (5) classification rules, confidence estimates, and metadata from the land cover classification. This database is now being developed using a Mapping Zone approach, with 66 Zones in the continental United States and 23 Zones in Alaska. Results from three initial mapping Zones show single-pixel land cover accuracies ranging from 73 to 77 percent, imperviousness accuracies ranging from 83 to 91 percent, tree canopy accuracies ranging from 78 to 93 percent, and an estimated 50 percent increase in mapping efficiency over previous methods.

40|$|This {{technical}} note describes how big sagebrush habitats (Artemisia tridentata, including Wyoming, basin, and mountain subspecies) are being assessed and managed at multiple spatial scales within a Bureau of Land Management resource area in southeast Oregon. It {{shows how the}} assessment results {{can be used to}} make determinations pertaining to standards and guidelines for greater sage-grouse and other animals that use sagebrush habitats. In this example, the assessment included information at the broad-scale (Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project; 145 million acres), mid-scale (Southeast Oregon Resource Management Plan-Final Environmental Impact Statement; 4. 6 million acres, and Louse Canyon Geographic Management Area; 0. 52 million acres), fine-scale (pasture; less than 2, 000 to 88, 000 acres), and site- or local-scale (ecological site; variable in size but typically smaller than pasture) levels. The scales are interrelated and played equally important roles in building management objectives. Big sagebrush <b>canopy</b> cover structural <b>classes</b> were created, which were the basic building blocks of the sagebrush objectives and which addressed spatial patterning of habitat structure, connectivity, and fragmentation, as well as the cumulative effects of disturbance from fires and land treatments. Findings from the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project and more local information from the Jordan Resource Area of BLM’s Vale District were used to guide development of mid-scale big sagebrush habitat objectives. This example provides other BLM field offices in the sagebrush biome with ideas for how they might develop their own multiple-scale big sagebrush assessment to achieve land use plan objectives and rangeland health standards...|$|R
40|$|The Purcell Mountains of {{southeast}} British Columbia support {{a population of}} mountain caribou near the southernmost extension of their range. This ecotype is dependent upon late-successional forests, largely because such stands provide arboreal lichen for winter forage. Recent provincial forest practices legislation and land-use planning initiatives have provided the impetus for developing an interim caribou habitat assessment model {{for use as a}} planning tool. We applied an HSI (habitat suitability index) model developed for a nearby population as a testable hypothesis of caribou habitat selection in the southern Purcells. In a study area of about 6000 km 2, 512 radiolocations were obtained for 22 animals from 1993 through 1995. Seasonal selectivity was assessed for the following model variables: elevation, slope, habitat type/current cover type, overstory size <b>class,</b> <b>canopy</b> closure, and age of dominant overstory. Caribou were most selective for stand age, which the model also defined as the greatest determinant of habitat suitability. However, we did not judge overall model output to be an adequate predictor of habitat selection by southern Purcell caribou. Seasonal ratings for each variable were therefore modified to better reflect selection patterns by animals in this study, and subjectively adjusted to ensure that potentially limiting habitat types were rated highly. An evaluation of the adjusted model established its efficacy as an interim decision-support tool. Selection analyses of spatial habitat distribution levels indicated a preference by caribou for landscapes with at least 40 % suitable habitat per 250 ha and per 5000 ha. From this, it is apparent that suitable habitat is highly fragmented in this study area...|$|R
30|$|With {{relation}} to the choice of extracting trees taller than 15  m, a comparison of tree delineation methods by Jakubowski et al. (2013) suggested that ALS data {{with an average of}} around 2 points·m−[*] 2 was sufficient for detecting large individual trees. In general, attempts to extract individual tree attributes have relied on higher densities. Point densities >[*] 9 points·m−[*] 2 were used to accurately extract tree height, base height, crown diameter, and crown volume as well as perform segmentation of individual trees directly from the raw LiDAR point cloud (Zhang et al. 2015). Smaller trees might require even higher density. In terms of the accuracy assessment, to effectively optimize the parameters of the automatic workflow, a comprehensive validation dataset is required. In addition future work could focus on the extraction of other tree attributes besides tree location and crown size. For example, individual crown structure can be examined using ALS as filled and open volumes within a canopy (Lefsky et al. 1999). The approach involves superimposing a grid over individual canopies composed of 0.1  m 3 voxels up {{to the level of the}} highest LiDAR return. These cells are classified as either “filled” or “empty” volume depending on whether a return was recorded within the voxel and as either “euphotic” zone, if the cell is located within the uppermost 65 % of all filled volumes, or as “oligophotic” zone if it is located below this point in the profile. Coops et al. (2007) found that the overall canopy surface structure of Douglas-fir stands in coastal British Columbia, Canada, were characterized by the total amount of the “open gap” <b>canopy</b> volume profile <b>class</b> with dense, shorter stands showing an even upper canopy surface, while the mixed, more variable crown structures, have a significantly higher amount of open gaps, which are indicative of increased total canopy surface.|$|R
40|$|Background Conserving {{biodiversity}} {{in tropical}} landscapes {{is a major}} challenge to scientists and conservationists. Current rates of deforestation, fragmentation, and land use intensification are producing variegated landscapes with undetermined values {{for the conservation of}} biological communities and ecosystem functioning. Here, we investigate the importance of tropical variegated landscapes to biodiversity conservation, using dung beetle as focal taxa. Methods The study was carried out in 12 variegated landscapes where dung beetles were sampled using six pitfall traps, 30 m apart from each other, along a transect in each studied landscape use and cover classes—LUCC (forest fragment and corridor, coffee plantation, and pasture). We baited each pitfall trap with 30 g of human feces and left open for a 48 h period. We also measured three environmental variables reflecting structural differences among the studied classes: canopy cover, local vegetation heterogeneity and soil sand content. Results We collected 52 species and 2, 695 individuals of dung beetles. We observed significant differences in the mean species richness, abundance and biomass among classes, with forest fragments presenting the highest values, forest corridors and coffee plantations presenting intermediate values, and pastures the lowest values. Regarding community structure, we also found significant differences among <b>classes.</b> <b>Canopy</b> cover was the only variable explaining variation in dung beetle species richness, abundance, biomass, and community structure. The relative importance of spatial turnover was greater than nestedness-resultant component in all studied landscapes. Discussion This study evaluated the ecological patterns of dung beetle communities in variegated tropical landscapes highlighting the importance of these landscapes for conservation of tropical biodiversity. However, we encourage variegation for the management of landscapes that have already been fragmented or as a complementary initiative of current conservation practices (e. g., protection of natural habitats and establishment of reserves) ...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{dependence}} of spotted owls (Strix occidentalis) on older forests has been well documented, the specific attributes of comparatively younger forests used by owls have not been described in some regions. We collected habitat data at locations used by spotted owls tracked in an intensive radio-telemetry study to develop descriptions of these forests on the western Olympic Peninsula, Washington. After addressing the effects of triangulation error on the placement of our vegetation sampling plots, we collected data at all 16 telemetry locations that could be clearly associated with non-old-growth habitat, as well as 16 random locations. Owl locations were divided into 2 groups to reflect single-use (only one radio location within the error polygon) and multiple-use sites (gtoreq 2 radio locations within the error polygon) within home ranges. Vegetation data collected in three arrays of variably-sized plots included measures of stem and snag density (by diameter <b>class),</b> <b>canopy</b> cover, and cover of downed wood and shrubs. Our analyses indicated that single-visit and random locations did not differ {{with respect to the}} variables we recorded. However, both differed from multiple-use locations in abundance of larger snags, and amount of canopy closure. A logistic regression model indicated that multiple-use sites could be reliably distinguished from single-use and random locations based on the greater number of snags gtoreq 51 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) and gtoreq 70 % canopy closure. Younger forests managed for spotted owl foraging habitat in this region should be in the understory reinitiation stage of stand development, have gtoreq 70 % canopy closure, and contain gtoreq 4 snags/ 0. 4 -ha that are gtoreq 51 cm dbh. The habitat definitions we propose may not be applicable to other areas characterized by different forest types and prey assemblagesBuchanan et al "Characteristics of young forests used by spotted owls on the western Olympic Peninsula, Washington.

40|$|Variation in {{the effects}} of {{disturbance}} across three differently aged glacial terraces in a terrace rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) forest were investigated. Disturbance histories were reconstructed and associated patterns of stand development, differences in stand composition and stand structure determined. This forest variation was related to environmental variation between the differently aged terraces. Forest stand composition was investigated across the three terraces using Indicator Species Analysis and Detrended Correspondence Analysis for data collected from ninety stands. This data was used to categorise forest community composition. Analysis of stand structure focused on the dominant stand type {{on each of the}} three terraces for which disturbance histories and patterns of stand development were determined. Disturbance histories were reconstructed form size and age-class frequency distributions, and the spatial distribution of tree ages to identify even-aged groups of trees that had established in response to past disturbance. Soil drainage and stage of soil development were determined for the dominant stands. Differences in stand structure between the three main stands reflected differences in disturbance history which were associated with different soil profile and soil drainage characteristics. For stand S 1 on the oldest terrace the spatial distribution of tree ages showed that catastrophic disturbance had occurred on the most poorly drained and deepest soils. For stand S 2 on the middle aged terrace sporadic gap formation had occurred on less poorly drained and shallower soils. For stand S 3 on the youngest terrace progressive canopy mortality had occurred on the shallowest soils, of a similar drainage to those in stand S 2. Variation in the soil characteristics between terraces reflected a secular trend in soil development towards increased depth and poorer drainage. Stand composition was primarily influenced by disturbance history. The effects of different disturbance histories on stand composition was inferred from species regeneration patterns, the distribution of seedlings beneath different <b>canopy</b> cover <b>classes,</b> and gap regeneration characteristics. The least shade tolerant species, Dacrydium cupressinum, Lagarostrobos colensoi and Phyllocladus alpinus favoured regeneration after infrequent catastrophic disturbance. While the more shade tolerant Prumnopitys ferruginea, Weinmannia racemosa and Quintinia acutifolia favoured establishment following more frequent canopy gap formation. Differences in stand composition also reflected differences in soil drainage, interspecific competition, and stand structure. The association of species with differently drained soils within stands and between stands suggested Lagarostrobos colensoi and Phyllocladus alpinus favoured the most poorly drained soils, while Prumnopitys ferruginea favoured less poorly drained soils. Interspecific competition accounted for ongoing compositional changes where Dacrydium cupressinum appeared to be competing out Phyllocladus alpinus and Lagarostrobos colensoi on account of its greater stature and longevity. Stand structure affected species richness. The least number of species was associated with the most uniform stands while the highest number of species was associated with the least uniform stands. Uniform stands were presumed to reduce the chance of colonisation by differentially adapted species. Variation in {{the effects of}} disturbance explained changes in stand structure and composition across the terraces. A secular change in the stand dynamics of terrace rimu forest is envisaged over millennia reflecting soil development, where changes in forest composition and stand structure reflect the interaction of disturbance and soil drainage...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Evidence {{suggests}} that western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) in Central Oregon affects understory production and composition. As trees increase {{in size and}} density, understory production is reduced and composition changes. This {{study was designed to}} identify the relationship between production and composition of understory vegetation and various tree canopy sizes of western juniper, and to describe the responses of understory vegetation to removal of western juniper. Understory production was sampled in 1983 and 1984 by clipping plots on an individual trees basis from areas with trees present and areas from which trees had been removed in 1982. Biomass production was determined from trees within three <b>canopy</b> diameter size <b>classes</b> and from two zones, beneath the canopy and in the interspace. Production was examined on two sites, a lower slope, shallow soil site and an upper slope, moderately deep soil site. Some year-to-year differences in production of individual species and specific tree sizes may be explained by variation in precipitation during critical growth periods the two years of the study. Sandberg bluegrass and, possibly, Idaho fescue production may have been greater in 1983 than 1984 due to variation in late spring precipitation, especially on shallow soils associated with small trees. Differences in patterns of production of individual species were most clearly developed associated with large, rather than small and intermediate trees. Cheatgrass, squirreltail, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Idaho fescue were common beneath the canopy, while Sandberg bluegrass was common in the interspaces. Cheatgrass and perennial forb production beneath the canopy increased with tree size. Production of other species, such as Sandberg bluegrass, was apparently not affected by tree size. Canopy removal resulted in species-specific increases in biomass production both years. Production increases were greater beneath the canopy than in the interspaces. Perennial grasses provided small variable production increases beneath the canopy of large trees. Annual grasses, primarily cheatgrass, and annual forbs, primarily Epilobium paniculatum, contributed most to elevated productivity the first two years following juniper removal. Cheatgrass response was mainly associated with large trees, while annual forb response was independent of tree size. Sandberg bluegrass production seemed more closely tied to growing season precipitation than to canopy removal, regardless of tree size...|$|R
40|$|Tallgrass prairie is an {{endangered}} ecosystem and encroachment by woody species threatens many remnants. Insights are needed into {{the differences in}} diversity and species and functional group composition along a gradient of woody encroachment to help gauge restoration potential and gain insights into patterns of disassembly in grassland communities. The study site is a 65 ha (160 acre) tallgrass prairie and old field mosaic in Lake County, Illinois. The three main objectives {{in this study are}} to: (1) analyze and classify plant communities, (2) explore seed bank dynamics and its contribution to old field colonization, and (3) determine the patterns of species and functional group richness and cover in a tallgrass prairie:old field mosaic with varying levels of shrub invasion and assess whether there are ordered patterns of loss in richness and cover with increasing shrub canopy cover. Ground layer and shrub layer data were collected from 45 sample plots including 37 located on stratified transects and eight located randomly in high-quality reference prairie habitat. Two community types were identified through field observation and reinforced by cluster analysis, indicator species analysis, and Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS). The communities differed significantly in species density, species richness, ground layer cover, floristic quality indices, shrub canopy cover, and percent bare ground. To assess whether germination from the seed bank was limited by the lack of fire at the site, soil samples were heat treated prior to placement in greenhouse flats and germination rates were compared to a control. Heat shock had a variable effect on germination, and the species germinating from the seed bank were dependant upon the treatment. S??rensen Similarity Index indicated that there was very little similarity between the species present in the seed bank and the standing vegetation. To determine if prairie remnants were responsible for the recolonization of the site after agricultural disturbance, species data were examined on a distance gradient to the nearest remnant. Overall species richness, proportion of prairie species, and Floristic Quality Index had no relationship with distance to remnants. Results suggests that many areas of the site are seed limited, further complicating the restoration of plant communities. Possible causes of seed bank failure as a refugium could be attributed to the past history of rigorous cultivation at the site and the recent history of shrub encroachment. Species composition data were converted to plant functional groups based on species traits to assess whether increasing shrub canopy cover leads to loss or decline in richness and cover in species with shared traits. The relationships between functional group richness and ground layer cover to shrub canopy cover were examined with linear regression, discriminant analysis, ANOVA followed by Tukey post-hoc tests, and NMS. Cover of C 4 grass, perennial legume, perennial forb, perennial sedge, C 3 grass and annual forb functional groups and richness of C 4 grass, perennial legume, and perennial forb functional groups follow ordered decline with increasing shrub canopy cover and differences among <b>canopy</b> cover <b>classes</b> were significant. NMS provides a graphical summary indicating functional groups representative of prairie communities are associated with low canopy cover plots compared with closed canopy plots. Comparisons with previous studies at this site suggest shrub species have increased in density three fold in the past fourteen years. Results from this study highlight ordered patterns of losses in the cover and richness of plant functional groups that {{can be used as a}} guideline to evaluate sites undergoing shrub encroachment that have important management implications for restoration and management of grassland ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{waterways}} {{are highly}} degraded; recent {{research indicates that}} management by planting riverbanks can reduce water pollution and increase wildlife habitat. There are ecological, social, economic and legal reasons for restoring riparian zones (areas of land adjacent to waterways) in and near cities. Christchurch, New Zealand, {{was used as a}} case-study to develop an approach for selecting riparian plant species, and ascertaining their environmental ranges, to enhance planting success. The approach involved choosing relevant environmental variables, simple field sampling methods, and data analysis and presentation methods suitable for use by non-specialist restoration practitioners. Environmental data for self-established and planted individuals of several riparian species were collected from semi-natural riparian areas in the Low Plains Ecological District. The environmental variables measured in the field included soil moisture, elevation and distance from water, broadly defined riparian class (eg., river, backswamp), and specifically defined riparian class (eg., lower bank, mid-bank), slope and slope shape (as indications of drainage), aspect, frost, and soil pH and conductivity. Between species t-tests were performed to ascertain the most important environmental variables for each species. Within species t-tests were done for species where both self-established and planted data was recorded. Ordination assisted in identifying duplicate environmental variables. Species ranges were compared in Tukey boxplots. Comparison of self-established and planted data for several tree species and Phormium tenax indicated that planted individuals were found in significantly higher, drier and more frosty sites than their self-established counterparts (most p-values > 0. 05). Soil moisture, riparian <b>class,</b> <b>canopy</b> and slope were the most distinguishing environmental variables. Species responded to different combinations of these variables and were within the expected ranges for the Christchurch area. With refinement, frost and aspect may also be useful variables. Variables not fully captured but considered important are water level fluctuation and soil texture. It was concluded that the methods were most applicable in areas where little information on species ranges exists, or for monitoring species in modified urban restoration projects. Several variables could be summarised into a graph and table, however the development of a simple species database is suggested for inputting, analysing, and updating complex data. GIS {{is considered to be a}} useful tool for mapping, planning and monitoring riparian restoration projects in large scale or sensitive projects. One future direction for research is the development of an interactive database, compiling information on species attributes and riparian function (eg., for erosion control), to support the riparian management decision process. In conclusion, the approach developed will assist in selecting suitable species for the environmental gradients at a riparian restoration site, and should lead to a more rigorous and successful approach to riparian planting and monitoring...|$|R
