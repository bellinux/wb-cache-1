50|$|In {{this type}} of thermocell the {{electrolyte}} {{is some kind of}} salt with a relatively low melting point. Their use solve two problems. On one hand the temperature range of the cell is much larger. This is an advantage as these cells produce more power the larger the difference between the hot and cold sides. On the other hand, the liquid salt directly provides the anions and cations necessary for sustainment of a current through the cell. Therefore, no additional current-carrying compounds are necessary as the melted salt is the electrolyte itself. Typical hot source temperatures are between 600-900 K, but can get as high as 1730 K. <b>Cold</b> <b>sink</b> temperatures are in the 400-500 K range.|$|E
50|$|In general terms, {{the larger}} the {{difference}} in temperature between the hot source and the <b>cold</b> <b>sink,</b> the larger is the potential thermal efficiency of the cycle. On Earth, the cold side of any heat engine is limited to being close to the ambient temperature of the environment, or not much lower than 300 kelvins, so most {{efforts to improve the}} thermodynamic efficiencies of various heat engines focus on increasing the temperature of the source, within material limits. The maximum theoretical efficiency of a heat engine (which no engine ever attains) is equal to the temperature difference between the hot and cold ends divided by the temperature at the hot end, all expressed as absolute temperatures (in kelvins).|$|E

50|$|A {{thermodynamic}} cycle {{consists of a}} linked sequence of thermodynamic processes that involve transfer of heat and work {{into and out of}} the system, while varying pressure, temperature, and other state variables within the system, and that eventually returns the system to its initial state. In the process of passing through a cycle, the working fluid (system) may convert heat from a warm source into useful work, and dispose of the remaining heat to a <b>cold</b> <b>sink,</b> thereby acting as a heat engine. Conversely, the cycle may be reversed and use work to move heat from a cold source and transfer it to a warm sink thereby acting as a heat pump. At every point in the cycle, the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium, so the cycle is reversible (its entropy change is zero, as entropy is a state function).|$|E
5000|$|A solar powered Stirling {{engine is}} a heat engine {{powered by a}} {{temperature}} gradient generated by the sun. It was patented by Roelf J. Meijer in 1987.His invention relates a heat engine, such as a Stirling cycle engine, with a solar dish collector {{in order to produce}} electricity. This apparatus consists of a large dish aimed at the sun to reflect the rays into the focus point, which is located {{at the center of the}} dish. Solar energy is then collected in the form of heat to fuel a Stirling cycle engine, [...] which operates by letting heat flow from a hot source to a <b>cold</b> <b>sink</b> in order to do work. The work output of the Stirling cycle is then used to drive a generator and create electric power. Moreover, in Meijer’s solar-powered engine, it is important that the dish always be pointed directly at the sun so that no shadows would be present in the solar dish collector, hence optimizing heat collection. This is where he ran into some issues because, in order for the apparatus to have a complete range of motion, lubrication and rotational systems would be necessary and may compromise structural stability.|$|E
5000|$|Where CHP is not used, steam {{turbines}} in stationary power plants use surface condensers as a <b>cold</b> <b>sink.</b> The condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans, rivers, lakes, and often by cooling towers which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal. The resulting condensed hot water, is then pumped {{back up to}} pressure and {{sent back to the}} boiler. A dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly. Waste heat can also be ejected by evaporative (wet) cooling towers use pass the rejected to external water cycle that evaporates some of flow to the air. Cooling towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air. Evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than [...] "once-through" [...] cooling by river or lake water; a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling, but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water. Evaporative water cannot be used for subsequent purposes (other than rain somewhere), whereas river water can be re-used. In all cases, the steam plant water, which must be kept pure, is kept separate from the cooling water or air, and once the low-pressure steam condenses into water, it is returned to the boiler.|$|E
