5|$|S. <b>ciliata</b> is a benthic {{carnivore}} {{that feeds}} predominantly on polychaetes and various crustaceans. Like {{other species of}} Sillago, the diet of the species {{is related to the}} size and age of the individual, with three distinct size classes identified in a study conducted in Botany Bay, NSW. The smallest fish of 0–10cm take large amount of amphipods and few polychaetes, while fish between 11 and 20cm consume mostly neried polychaetes and few amphipods. The largest fish over 21cm take large amounts of bivalve molluscs and shrimps of the genus Callianassa.|$|E
5|$|S. <b>ciliata</b> is most {{commonly}} called the 'sand whiting' {{in reference to}} its preference for sandy substrates compared to {{some members of the}} genus which prefer muddy, silty, or grassy substrates. Other common names include the 'blue-nose whiting' in reference to the colour of the nose in fish of larger sizes, and 'summer whiting', a name often applied to S. analis as well. This name is applied to these species as they move from deeper offshore waters into shallow beach and estuarine waters in summer, where they become a target for recreational fishers.|$|E
5|$|The sand whiting (Sillago <b>ciliata),</b> {{also known}} as the summer whiting, yellowfin whiting or blue-nose whiting, is a common species of coastal marine fish of the family Sillaginidae, the smelt-whitings. It is a slender, {{slightly}} compressed fish that is very similar to other species of Sillago, with detailed spine, ray and lateral line scale counts needed to distinguish the species between its nearest relative Sillago analis. The sand whiting is distributed along the east coast of Australia from Cape York south to Tasmania, as well as Lord Howe Island and New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
50|$|Mopalia <b>ciliata's</b> valve colors mainly vary between pale green, {{white or}} dark brown. They can have {{colorful}} markings sometimes of olive, white, orange, red and blue. The girdle color can be dark green, pinkish or white.|$|R

Rolf Singer {{put it in}} the section Rubromarginata in his 1986 The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy, a group characterized by having distinct red marginate gills. The specific epithet purpureofuscus combines the Latin words purpur (purple) and fusco (dark or dusky). It is commonly known as the [...] "purple edge bonnet".|$|R
5|$|An ectomycorrhizal species, Caloboletus calopus {{grows in}} {{coniferous}} and deciduous woodland, often at higher altitudes, especially under beech and oak. Fruit bodies occur singly or in large groups. The species grows on chalky ground from July to December, in Northern Europe, and North America's Pacific Northwest and Michigan. In North America, its range extends south to Mexico. Variety frustosus is known from California and the Rocky Mountains of Idaho. In 1968, after comparing European and North American collections, Miller and Watling {{suggested that the}} typical form of C.calopus does not occur in the United States. Similar comparisons by other authors have {{led them to the}} opposite conclusion, and the species has since been included in several North American field guides. The bolete has been recorded from the Black Sea region in Turkey, from under Populus <b>ciliata</b> and Abies pindrow in Rawalpindi and Nathia Gali in Pakistan, Yunnan Province in China, Korea, and Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|Evergreen oaks, rhododendrons, and {{conifers}} predominate in the hills. sal (Shorea robusta), silk {{cotton tree}} (Bombax <b>ciliata),</b> Dalbergia sissoo, Mallotus philippensis, Acacia catechu, Bauhinia racemosa, and Bauhinia variegata (camel's foot tree) {{are some other}} trees of the region. Albizia chinensis, the sweet sticky flowers of which are favoured by sloth bears, {{are also part of}} the region's flora. A decade long study by Prof. Chandra Prakash Kala concluded that the Valley of Flowers is endowed with 520 species of higher plants (angiosperms, gymnosperms and pteridophytes), of these 498 are flowering plants. The park has many species of medicinal plants including Dactylorhiza hatagirea, Picrorhiza kurroa, Aconitum violaceum, Polygonatum multiflorum, Fritillaria roylei, and Podophyllum hexandrum. In the summer season of 2016, a large portion of forests in Uttarakhand caught fires and rubbled to ashes during Uttarakhand forest fires incident which resulted in the damage of forest resources worth billions of rupees and death of 6 people with hundreds of wild animals died during fires.|$|E
5|$|The {{forests of}} the region {{are known to be}} {{evergreen}} type with a preponderance of deciduous species with a levelled distribution. The topmost level consists of Garjan (Dipterocarpus alatus), Telsur (Hopea odorata), Chapalish (Artocarpus chaplasha), Chundul (Tetrameles nudiflora) and Koroi or the Moluccan albizia (Falcataria moluccana). The lower level consists of species of Jarul (Lagerstroemia speciosa), Toon (Toona <b>ciliata),</b> Jam (Syzygium cumini), Jalpai (Elaeocarpus robustus) and Glochidion. Lianas, epiphytes (mostly of orchids, asclepiads, ferns and leafy mosses) and herbaceous undergrowths are abundant. Savannah formations are found in the open, along the banks of rivers and swamps with common tall grasses like Kans (Saccharum spontaneum), Shon (Imperata cylindrica and I. arundincca) and Bena (Vetiveria zizanoides). Several species of Bamboo are cultivated that are common in Bangladesh including Bambusa balcooa (which is also common in Assam), B. vulgaris, B. longispiculata, B. tulda and B. nutans; the latter two also being common in the hills of the region.|$|E
40|$|Saxifraga L., {{the largest}} genus (ca. 460 spp.) {{in the family}} Saxifragaceae, is widely {{distributed}} across Europe and Asia, mainly in the Alps and the Sino-Himalayan area, with extensions in the Rocky Mt / Andean Cordillera south to Tierra del Fuego. The genus displays remarkable morphological variation. Phylogenetic {{analyses were conducted to}} test previous classifications. Molecular evidence comprised DNA sequences from the chloroplast gene (matK) and nuclear regions (ITS and Duo 1). The sequences were also used in plant identification. In many cases genetic distances between species in terms of DNA sequences were very low, indicating rapid evolution. Morphological evidence, including microscopic characters from pollen nuclear number, exine and leaf venation, was also collected. Phylogenetic trees were produced from the molecular data, the morphological data and from the combined data. Morphological data improved resolution in the molecular trees. The phylogenies were in substantial agreement and suggested that a few taxonomic realignments and new combinations are needed to make the sections and subsections monophyletic. A revised classification of Saxifraga primarily to subsection level is presented. The main changes from previous classifications are: (1) genus Saxifragella is included as a monotypic section in Saxifraga; (2) sect. <b>Ciliatae</b> subsect. Serpyllifoliae is merged into sect. <b>Ciliatae</b> subsect. Rosulares; (3) sect. <b>Ciliatae</b> subsect. Cinerascentes is merged with subsection Gemmiparae; (4) section Porphyrion is monophyletic only if S. mutata and S. florulenta (formerly in sect. Ligulatae) are included; this transfer also makes sect. Ligulatae monophyletic; (5) S. mutata and S. aizoides (the later formerly in sect. Xanthizoon) are closely related and are now placed together in ser. Xanthizoon of sect. Porphyrion. The geographical distributions of the basal sections of the genus, i. e. Irregulares, Heterisia, Saxifragella and Trachyphyllum suggest an origin of the genus around the shores of the Pacific Ocean, probably in the Beringian area...|$|R
40|$|Rice field weed {{communities}} {{occurring in}} central Nepal {{are presented in}} this study. The research was focussed on the classification of segetal plant communities occurring in paddy fi elds, which had been poorly investigated from a geobotanical standpoint. In all, 108 phytosociological relevés were sampled, using the Braun-Blanquet method. The analyses classified the vegetation into 9 communities, including 7 associations and one subassociation. Four new plant associations and one new subassociation were proposed: Elatinetum triandro-ambiguae, Mazo pumili-Lindernietum <b>ciliatae,</b> Mazo pumili-Lindernietum <b>ciliatae</b> caesulietosum axillaris, Rotaletum rotundifoliae and Ammanietum pygmeae. Due to species composition and habitat preferences all phytocoenoses were included into the Oryzetea sativae class and the Ludwigion hyssopifolio-octovalvis alliance. As in other rice field phytocoenoses, the main discrimination factors for the plots are depth of water, soil trophy and species richness. The altitudinal distribution also has a significant influence and separates the Rotaletum rotundifoliae and Elatinetum triandro-ambiguae associations. The study shows that anthropogenic rice fields can harbour relatively rich rush and water vegetation. More than 80 species were noted in the vegetation plots. Several of them {{are considered to be}} extremely rare and have been recorded on the world Red List...|$|R
40|$|Saxifraga minutissima D. S. Rawat, {{a new and}} {{extremely}} small species of Saxifraga (Saxifragaceae), is described from the Garhwal Himalaya, India. It differs from all other species of Saxifraga, except Saxifraga bicuspidata, in having five stamens and lacking petals. It can be distinguished from Saxifraga bicuspidata in having leaves and sepals entire. The finely striate pollen exine pattern of Saxifraga minutissima indicates that the species belongs to Saxifraga section <b>Ciliatae.</b> Its prostrate, axillary leafy shoots and lack of crisped, rufous hairs strongly suggests a place in Saxifraga subsection Serpyllifoliae, where one of its closest relatives may be Saxifraga stella-aurea.

25|$|The {{species is}} known {{primarily}} as the 'yellowfin whiting' or 'yellow-finned whiting' {{in reference to}} the yellow pectoral, anal and caudal fins, and is recognised as such by the Australian Government. In Western Australia, the species is usually referred to as the 'western sand whiting' due to its close similarity with the sand whiting (Sillago <b>ciliata)</b> of Eastern Australia, with the name 'fine-scaled whiting' rarely used.|$|E
25|$|It often grows {{with trees}} such as white booyong (Argyrodendron trifoliolatum), Flindersia species, giant {{stinging}} tree (Dendrocnide excelsa), lacebark (Brachychiton discolor), red cedar (Toona <b>ciliata),</b> hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii), green-leaved fig (Ficus watkinsiana) and Cryptocarya obovata. The soils it grows on {{are high in}} nutrients, and include Bumbo Latite and Budgong Sandstone. As rainforests were cleared, isolated specimens were left standing in fields as remnant trees, valued for their shade and shelter for livestock. One such tree was a landmark for and gave {{its name to the}} Wollongong suburb of Figtree in New South Wales.|$|E
500|$|With {{respect to}} infrageneric {{classification}} (i.e., taxonomic ranking {{below the level}} of genus) in Mycena, several characteristics suggest the mushroom fits best in Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus' section Fragilipedes: the ellipsoidal, amyloid spores; dextrinoid spore-bearing tissue; smooth cheilocystidia; gills with the edge the same colour as the face; and the non-slimy, distinctly coloured cap. According to the 1986 infrageneric classification proposed by Rolf Singer, the mushroom would be classified in subgenus Mycena, subsection <b>Ciliatae,</b> [...] Alcalina (roughly equivalent to section Fragilipedes of Maas Geesteranus) because of the amyloid spores, smooth, elongated cheilocystidia, dull-coloured pigment, and stem without either latex or a slimy sheath. Grgurinovic erected the new section Nargan to accommodate M.nargan, because its scales, lack of coarse fibrils {{at the base of the}} stem, and lack of [...] coating meant it was not a good fit for section Fragilipedes.|$|R
40|$|DNA {{from the}} hypotrichous <b>ciliatae</b> Stylonychia lemnae was {{separated}} by PFGE. In {{addition to the}} separation of the macronuclear DNA molecules with a size up to ∼ 40 kb, we were able to separate the micronuclear DNA with a size between ∼ 90 kb and 2 Mb. One very prominent 90 -kb DNA band appeared on the pulsed-field gels. We propose that this 90 -kb DNA fragment represents a linear plasmid residing in the micronucleus in a very high copy number. About 10 % of the micronuclear DNA consists of the 90 -kb DNA molecule. It appears in the micronucleus {{as well as in the}} macronuclear anlagen during macronuclear development but not in the mature macronucleus. Thus, the multicopy DNA is eliminated during fragmentation of the macronuclear anlagen DNA in the course of macronuclear development. Therefore, this 90 -kb DNA molecule might serve as an excellent tool to study the recognition and elimination of DNA during nuclear differentiation of hypotrichous ciliates...|$|R
40|$|Romulea pilosa J. C. Manning & Goldblatt and R. quartzicola J. C. Manning & Goldblatt are two narrow {{endemics}} {{from the}} southern African winter rainfall region. An early, fragmentary collection of R. pilosa from Riviersonderend lacked the diagnostic corm and was thus mistakenly associated with R. tetragona (sect. <b>Ciliatae)</b> as var. flavandra M. P. de Vos because of the highly distinctive pilose, H-shaped leaf. The rediscovery of the taxon in the wild shows {{it to be a}} previously unrecognized member of sect. Aggregatae, distinguished by its unusual foliage and bright orange flowers. R. quartzicola was grown to flowering from seeds collected from quartz patches in southern Namaqualand and proved to be a new species of sect. <b>Ciliatae,</b> distinguished by its early flowering, short, subclavate leaves with reduced sclerenchyma strands, and bright yellow flowers with short bracts. R. neglecta M. P. de Vos, a rare endemic from the Kamiesberg in Northern Cape, is a later homonym for the Mediterranean R. neglecta Jord. & Fourr., and the earliest name for this plant is shown to be R. speciosa (Ker Gawl.) Baker, typified by an illustration in Andrews’ The botanist’s repository. An epitype is designated to fix the application of the name. We have also examined the type illustration of R. pudica (Sol. ex Ker Gawl.) Baker, hitherto treated as an uncertain species, and are confident that it represents the species currently known as R. amoena Schltr. ex Bég., and takes priority over it as being the earlier name. The type of R. reflexa Eckl., a new name for the later homonym I. reflexa Thunb. and the basionym of R. rosea var. reflexa (Eckl.) Bég., has been mistakenly identified as an Ecklon collection but is in fact the collection that formed the basis of Thunberg’s I. reflexa. This collection is actually a form of R. flava Lam., and the name R. rosea var. reflexa is thus moved to the synonomy of that species. The variety currently known under this name should now be known as R. rosea var. muirii (N. E. Br.) Goldblatt & J. C. Manning. Finally, the protologue of R. parviflora Eckl., until now treated under the synonomy of R. obscura Klatt var. obscura, is in fact consistent with R. rosea var. australis (Ewart) M. P. de Vos, and we therefore include the name in the synonomy of the latter...|$|R

Many crustacean and mollusc species rely on mangroves {{as a source of}} food whether by providing foraging through leaf litter, mud or direct predation of the mangrove trees and seeds. Soldier crabs (Mictyris longicarpus), semaphore crab (Heloecius cordiformis), blue swimmer crabs (Portunus pelagicus) and hermit crabs (Pagurus sinuatus) also call the mangroves home.

All of these names are invalid under the ICZN nomenclature rules, which states that the first correct naming is the one to be used. Many of these synonyms were applied due to confusion over S. <b>ciliata</b> and the nearly identical, closely related species S. analis.

Moraea marginata. another Roggeveld endemic, is a member of section Polvanthes and florally similar to M. fistulosa and M. monticola but differs in its linear, channelled leaves 5 - 7 mm wide, with unusual, thickened margins. Romulea singularis. from the edge of the Kobee River Valley in the Bokkeveld Mountains, is a member of section  <b>Ciliatae.</b> It is unique in the genus in its narrowly funnel-shaped, mauve to purple flowers with slender perianth tube 10 - 11 mm long, and unusually long filaments, 8 - 9 mm long, inserted in the lower half of the tube. </p...|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. Pteronia L. is a genus of 70 {{species of}} woody shrublets {{occurring}} mainly in southern Africa (Leistner, 2000). Published and unpublished ethnobotanical information exists for {{nine of the}} species. The uses of these species in traditional medicine are poorly recorded or have remained scientifically unknown. In addition, some unpublished vernacular names have been recorded during this study. Hutchinson and Phillips revised the genus Pteronia in 1917 and grouped the species into four sections. The nine ethnobotanically important species were placed in four sections: Incanae (P. incana and P. cinerea), Papillatae (P. lucilliodes and P. divaricata), <b>Ciliatae</b> (P. camphorata, P. stricta, P. onobromoides and P. adenocarpa) and Glabratae (P. succulenta). Pteronia onobromoides is the original source of Nama buchu that was first recorded by Van der Stel in 1685 (De Wet & Pheiffer, 1979), but which has remained poorly known. Surprisingly, this study has revealed {{the existence of an}} important Cape herbal medicine (P. divaricata) for which no record could be found in the scientific literature. Pteronia incana is not widely known for its traditional medicinal uses (although a few have indeed been recorded) but rather as a source of valuable essential oil that has been commercially exploited to some extent. Other species with at least one published anecdote of traditional use include P. adenocarpa, P. camphorata, P cinerea, P. lucilioides, P. stricta and P. succulenta. This means that a total of nine species are now known to have traditional medicinal and/or cosmetic uses. Most of the species are used for intestinal disorders (including stomach pain) and respiratory ailments (coughs, colds and influenza). The topical application of P. onobromoides and P. adenocarpa is clearly aimed at more than just a cosmetic effect and includes the alleviation of pain and the treatment of wounds and skin ailments. These uses all suggest that Pteronia species may have antimicrobial activity and also possible anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Pteronia adenocarpa is only known from a single literature record...|$|R
40|$|Field {{work during}} the past 15 years has {{resulted}} in the discovery of 12 new species of the western southern African genus Geissorhiza Ker Gawl. and range extensions for several more. Following a survey of pollen morphology in the genus, we describe new pollen types in one section each of the two subgenera: five species of section  <b>Ciliatae</b> Goldblatt and two of  section Weihea Eckl. ex Baker have more complex apertures than the plesiomorphic single aperture with a 2 -banded oper­culum found in other species. In addition, populations currently referred to the typical white (cream) -flowered  G. inflexa (D.

2500|$|The {{relationships}} of the Sillaginidae are poorly known, with very similar morphological characteristics {{and a lack}} of genetic studies restricting the ability to perform cladistic analyses on the family. Being the fossil sillaginids are based on the comparison of fossil otoliths, with no other type of remains found thus far, this also prevents the reconstruction of the evolution of the family through fossil species. While the position of the Sillaginidae in the order Perciformes is firmly established due to a number of synapomorphies shared {{with other members of the}} order, no sister group has been established for the family. The current taxonomic status of the family is thought to represent a basic picture of the group's phylogeny, with McKay further dividing the genus Sillago into three subgenera based on shared morphological characters of the swimbladder. The genera Sillaginodes and Sillaginopsis have the most plesiomorphic characteristics; being monotypic, and distinct from Sillago. Sillago is further divided into three subgenera based primarily on swim bladder morphology; Sillago, Parasillago and Sillaginopodys, which also [...] represent evolutionary relationships. Whilst genetic studies have not been done on the family, they have been used to establish the relationship of what were thought to be various subspecies of school whiting, S. bassensis and S. flindersi. Furthermore, morphological data suggests a number of Australian species diverged very recently during the last glacial maximum, which caused land bridges to isolate populations of fish. The two aforementioned species of school whiting, S. maculata and S. burrus, and S. <b>ciliata</b> and S. analis are all thought to be products of such a process, although only the school whiting have anything other than similar morphology as evidence of this process.|$|E

Capitula oblongo-ellipsoidea, c. 7 X 5 mm, bracteae omnes cristatae, basales ovatae, c. 6. 5 X 3 mm, sat brunneo-nigrae, mucronatae, mucrone ad 2. 5 mm longa, cristata, nigra, crista pallide flava in parte apicali tantum tenuiter et sparse papillata, medianae subcirculares ad panduriformes, 4 — 5 X 2 — 5 mm, margine sat brunneo-nigrae, uninerves, nervo completo laevi, in parte basali membranaceae. Sepala lateralia naviculata, fere ad apicem connata, c. 5 X 1 mm, membranacea ecristata. Petala 6, alba, 6 — 7 mm longa, unguiculata, ungui 4 — 5 mm, arcte cohaerentia et quasi tubulosa, limbo elliptico-oblongo, obtuso, c. 2 X 0. 8 mm. Stamina 6, c. 1. 2 mm, antheris ovoideis, c. 0. 6 mm, truncatis, emarginatis thecae basi obtusae; filamenta subulata, c. 0. 6 mm. Staminodia desunt. Ovarium subovoideum ad ellipsoideum, c. 2 X 1 mm, trilobum, in parte basali 3 -, in parte superiori 1 -loculare, stigmatibus 3 terminatum. Capsula ovario similis, sed ad 3 X 1. 5 mm metiens; semina sparse papillatae. Typus: Pritzel 635 a in L. Distr. : Australia — in scrub between Moore and Murchinson river. This specimen was found mixed with Stylidium bulbiferum Benth. var. septentrionale Mild braed in Pritzel 635. Therefore it is separated from that species under 635 a. This highly characteristic species differs from all other species of Xyris by the fimbriate top of the sheath, the united lateral sepals (also found in the Brasilian X. obtusiuscula Nilsson), the 6 united petals, the 6 stamens (also once found by the author in X. bancana Miquel), the more or less campylotropous ovules, the entire style, and the papillate curved seeds. Moreover, the flowers seem to be white but owing to the dried material it can not be stated for certain whether this is the proper colour. These details warrant the establishment of a separate section in Xyris, Australoxyris with the following Latin diagnosis: Xyris Linnaeus, sect. Australoxyris van Royen, nov. sect. Folia apice in sectione transversa triangularia, vaginae exteriores apice <b>ciliatae,</b> flores capitati; sepala lateralia maxime connata; petala 6, connata; stamina 6; stylus simplex; ovarium in parte basali 3 -loculare, in parte superiori 1 -loculare; ovula plus minusve campylotropa; semina papillata.

6000|$|So {{much have}} we seen on one little shell. But {{there is more}} to see close to it. Those yellow plants which I likened to squirrels' tails and lobsters' horns, and what not, are zoophytes of {{different}} kinds. Here is Sertularia argentea (true squirrel's tail); here, S. filicula, as delicate as tangled threads of glass; here, abietina; here, rosacea. The lobsters' horns are Antennaria antennina; and mingled with them are Plumulariae, always to be distinguished from Sertulariae by polypes growing {{on one side of the}} branch, and not on both. Here is falcata, with its roots twisted round a sea-weed. Here is cristata, on the same weed; and here is a piece of the beautiful myriophyllum, which has been battered in its long journey out of the deep water about the ore rock. For all these you must consult Johnson's [...] "Zoophytes," [...] and for a dozen smaller species, which you would probably find tangled among them, or parasitic on the sea-weed. Here are Flustrae, or sea-mats. This, which smells very like Verbena, is Flustra coriacea (Pl. I. Fig. 2). That scurf on the frond of ore-weed is F. lineata (Pl. Fig. 1). The glass bells twined about this Sertularia are Campanularia syringa (Pl. I. Fig. 9); and here is a tiny plant of Cellularia <b>ciliata</b> (Pl. I. Fig. 8). Look at it through the field-glass; for it is truly wonderful. Each polype cell is edged with whip-like spines, and on the back of some of them is - what is it, but a live vulture's head, snapping and snapping - what for? ...|$|E
