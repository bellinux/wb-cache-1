5|$|Loading and {{unloading}} a bulker is {{time-consuming and}} dangerous. The process is planned by the ship's <b>chief</b> <b>mate</b> under {{the direct and}} continued supervision of ship's captain. International regulations require that the captain and terminal master agree on a detailed plan before operations begin. Deck officers and stevedores oversee the operations. Occasionally loading errors are made that cause a ship to capsize or break in half at the pier.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Oram (Billy Crudup) is the <b>chief</b> <b>mate</b> {{aboard the}} colony ship Covenant {{and the husband}} of Kariine Oram. With Branson's death {{as a result of}} the {{neutrino}} flair from the nearby star, Christopher becomes the captain of Covenant, though he perceives his command as being questioned by Daniels and the other crew members. When Shaw's transmission is received from the habitable Engineer home world, Christopher orders Covenant to divert to the planet, though his judgment is met with protests from Daniels. After leading a ground expedition to the crashed Engineer ship, Christopher returns to the lander to see it explode. Christopher accepts David's aid on behalf of the survivors and accompanies David back to his base. He searches for Rosenthal, who he finds decapitated, along with David communicating with the Neomorph that killed her. Christopher kills the Neomorph and holds David at gunpoint, demanding an explanation for his activities. David leads him to his makeshift laboratory, as well as a hatchery, where he keeps a number of Alien eggs. David goads Christopher into approaching an egg, which results in a Facehugger attacking and impregnating him. Christopher is awoken a short time later by David, only to have the first Alien chestburster erupt from his chest, killing him.|$|E

25|$|Mates {{direct a}} ship's routine {{operation}} for the captain during work shifts, which are called watches. Mates stand watch for specified periods, usually in three duty sections, with 4 hours on watch and 8 hours off. When on a navigational watch, mates direct a bridge team by conning, directing courses through the helmsman and speed through the lee helmsman (or directly in open ocean). When {{more than one}} mate is necessary aboard a ship, they typically are designated <b>chief</b> <b>mate</b> or first mate, second mate and third mate. In addition to watch standers, mates directly supervise the ship's crew, and are assigned other tasks. The <b>chief</b> <b>mate</b> is usually in charge of cargo, stability and the deck crew, the second mate in charge of navigation plans and updates and the third mate as the safety officer. They also monitor and direct deck crew operations, such as directing line handlers during moorings, and anchorings, monitor cargo operations and supervise crew members engaged in maintenance and the vessel's upkeep.|$|E
25|$|On 6 May 1828 the Herald was wreaked on the Hokianga bar. The crew swam {{to shore}} at about 4 {{o'clock in the}} morning – there was no loss of life.

50|$|To {{become a}} master of vessels of any gross tons upon oceans in the United States, one must first {{accumulate}} at least 360 days of service (Recency - 90 days {{in the past three}} years on vessels of appropriate tonnage) while holding a <b>chief</b> <b>mate's</b> license. The <b>chief</b> <b>mate's</b> license, in turn, requires at least 360 days of service (Recency - 90 days {{in the past three years}} on vessels of appropriate tonnage) while holding a second mate's license, passing a battery of examinations, and approximately 13 weeks of classes. Similarly, one must have worked as a third mate for 360 days (Recency - 90 days in the past three years on vessels of appropriate tonnage) to have become a second mate.|$|R

25|$|In 1814 Surry transported 200 male convicts to Australia, {{guarded by}} 25 {{men of the}} 46th Regiment. During the voyage out from England {{malignant}} fever (typhoid fever) raged on board {{and a total of}} 42 men died before the ship anchored in Port Jackson on 27 July 1814. Of these 42 men: 36 were convicts (listed with their names and dates of death in the Sydney Gazette of 10 September 1814), 2 were of the ship's crew, 2 were soldiers from the 46th Regiment, 1 was the 1st (<b>Chief)</b> <b>Mate,</b> and shortly before the ship anchored the Master (Captain) of the ship also died.|$|E
25|$|From Dublin, {{he crossed}} to Liverpool {{to become an}} {{ordinary}} seaman on the British merchant ship Tangier (also recorded as Tanjore), bound for China. During two years as a seaman, he rounded Cape Horn twice, landed at Batavia (now Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies, and visited the Maluku Islands, Manila, Hong Kong, Saigon, Singapore, and San Francisco. While at sea, he studied for the Board of Trade examination, and, {{at the age of}} eighteen, he received his certificate as a fully qualified Second Mate. Slocum quickly rose through the ranks to become a <b>Chief</b> <b>Mate</b> on British ships transporting coal and grain between the British Isles and San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|Ishmael digresses on {{pictures}} of whales, brit (microscopic sea creatures on which whales feed), squid and— after four boats lowered in vain because Daggoo mistook a giant squid {{for the white}} whale— whale-lines. The next day, in the Indian Ocean, Stubb kills a sperm whale, and that night Fleece, the Pequods black cook, prepares him a rare whale steak. Fleece delivers a sermon to the sharks that fight each other to feast on the whale's carcass, tied to the ship, saying that their nature is to be voracious, but they must overcome it. The whale is prepared, beheaded, and barrels of oil are tried out. Standing {{at the head of}} the whale, Ahab begs it to speak of the depths of the sea.

25|$|In September 1720, the Good Fortune was careened and {{repaired}} at {{the island}} of Carriacou before being renamed the Royal Fortune, {{the first of several}} ships to be given this name by Roberts. In late September, the Royal Fortune and the Fortune headed for the island of St. Christopher's and entered Basse Terra Road, flying black flags and with their drummers and trumpeters playing. They sailed in among the ships in the Road, all of which promptly struck their flags. The next landfall was {{at the island}} of St. Bartholomew, where the French governor allowed the pirates to remain for several weeks to carouse. By 25 October, they were at sea again off St. Lucia, where they captured up to 15 French and English ships in the next three days. Among the captured ships was the Greyhound, whose <b>chief</b> <b>mate</b> James Skyrme joined the pirates. He later became captain of Roberts' consort, the Ranger.|$|E
500|$|Morrell had an eventful early career, {{running away}} to sea {{at the age}} of 17 and being twice {{captured}} and imprisoned by the British during the War of 1812. He subsequently sailed [...] for several years before being appointed as <b>chief</b> <b>mate,</b> and later as captain, of the New York sealer Wasp. In 1823 he took Wasp for an extended voyage into subantarctic waters, and on his return made unsubstantiated claims to have travelled beyond 70 °S and to have sighted new coastlines in the area now known as the Weddell Sea. His subsequent voyages mainly centered on the Pacific, where he attempted to develop trading relations with the indigenous populations. Although Morrell wrote of the enormous potential wealth to be obtained from the Pacific trade, his endeavours were, in the main, commercially unprofitable.|$|E
500|$|Morrell {{was born}} at Rye, in Westchester County, New York, on July 5, 1795. He grew up in Stonington, Connecticut, where his father, also named Benjamin, was {{employed}} as a shipbuilder. Morrell, after minimal schooling, ran away to sea {{at the age of}} 17 [...] "without taking leave of any member of my family, or intimating my purpose to a single soul". During the War of 1812, which broke out while he was at sea, he was twice captured by the British; on his first voyage his ship, carrying a cargo of flour, was intercepted off St John's, Newfoundland, and Morrell was detained for eight months. His second voyage landed him in Dartmoor prison, England, for two years. After his release Morrell continued his seafaring career, sailing before the mast as an ordinary seaman since his lack of education prevented him advancing to officer rank. A sympathetic captain, Josiah Macy, taught him what he needed to know to qualify as an officer, [...] and in 1821 he was appointed <b>chief</b> <b>mate</b> on the sealer Wasp, under Captain Robert Johnson.|$|E
