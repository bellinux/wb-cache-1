At early spring, they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>observed</b> feeding on pollen and nectar of nearby flowers and particularly on Fabacae and Vicia spp.. Some B. rufimanus can survive during winter in larval or pupal diapause inside the seeds and terminate their diapause, finish their post-embryonic growth and emerge from the seeds after sowing.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{supernova}} {{has been}} observed in the Milky Way since 1604, it appears that a supernova exploded in the constellation Cassiopeia about 300 years ago, around the year 1667 or 1680. The remnant of this explosion, Cassiopeia Ais heavily obscured by interstellar dust, which is possibly why it {{did not make a}} notable appearance. However it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>observed</b> {{in other parts of the}} spectrum, and it is currently the brightest radio source beyond our solar system.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium(III) ions shows two sharp {{fluorescence}} peaks at 652nanometers (red light) and 742nanometers (deep red – near infrared) due {{to internal}} transitions at the f-electron shell. The relative intensity of these peaks {{depends on the}} excitation power and temperature of the sample. This emission <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>observed,</b> for example, after dispersing berkelium ions in a silicate glass, by melting the glass in presence of berkelium oxide or halide.|$|E

5|$|Chiral phases {{usually have}} a helical {{twisting}} of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is {{on the order of}} the wavelength of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>observed.</b> The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These materials can thus be used as polarization filters.|$|E
5|$|Erosion {{within the}} last century has {{resulted}} in a falls that is fairly narrowly channeled and vigorous, notably after a heavy rain. Photographs of the waterfall from the 19th century show a much wider, curtain like character to the falls. When the creek is dry, the older, much-broader ledge <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>observed.</b> If there were sufficient interest and funding, some remedial work could theoretically restore the 19th century appearance of the falls.|$|E

Deer and elk can be found below the timberline, including mule deer, mule deer-black-tailed hybrids, Roosevelt elk, and Rocky Mountain elk that were introduced from Yellowstone National Park in 1913. Black-tailed deer are especially common.|$|E

However, proponents of bathhouses point out that closing these facilities does not prevent people from engaging in unsafe sex.|$|E

The beach has gained a European Blue Flag Award for its cleanliness and safety. The village has three other smaller beaches, which are surrounded by chalk cliffs and cliff stacks.

5|$|Our {{main source}} of {{information}} about celestial bodies and other objects is visible light more generally electromagnetic radiation. Observational astronomy may be divided according to the observed region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Some parts of the spectrum <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>observed</b> from the Earth's surface, while other parts are only observable from either high altitudes or outside the Earth's atmosphere. Specific information on these subfields is given below.|$|E
5|$|Persistent carbenes {{can exist}} in the singlet or the triplet states with the singlet state carbenes being more stable. The {{relative}} stability of these compounds is only partly due to steric hindrance by bulky groups. Some singlet carbenes are thermodynamically stable {{in the absence of}} moisture and (in most cases) oxygen, and can be isolated and indefinitely stored. Others dimerise slowly over days. Triplet state carbenes have half-lives measured in seconds, and therefore <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>observed</b> but not stored.|$|E

5|$|Since the mid-1990s, Limousin breeders {{have worked}} {{extensively}} on improving disposition issues in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. This has been {{aided by the}} high heritability of temperament and {{by the development of}} genetic measures of docility (among many other traits) predicted from field measurements and subsequent analysis using BLUP techniques to produce docility EBVs and EPDs. Significant improvement has been recorded in the temperament of Limousins, as <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>observed</b> from trait trends published by various international breed associations.|$|E
5|$|Sirius <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>observed</b> in {{daylight}} {{with the naked}} eye under the right conditions. Ideally, the sky should be very clear, with the observer at a high altitude, the star passing overhead, and the Sun low down on the horizon. These observing conditions are more easily met in the southern hemisphere, due to the southerly declination of Sirius.|$|E
