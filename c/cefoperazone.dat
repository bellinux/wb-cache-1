Brown of six captive alligators showing signs of pneumonia, polyserositis (inflammation of serous membranes), and multifocal arthritis.  The isolates were obtained from various organs, blood, synovial fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid and subject to various experimental tests for identification purposes. Primary isolates were cultured in ATCC medium 98 agar containing 105 U penicillin G 1−1, 10 5 U polymyin B 1 −1 , 65 mg <b>cefoperazone</b> 1 −1 and 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 atmosphere or in ambient air. Isolates were then grown at seven different temperatures in an anaerobic environment, reaching optimum growth at 30 to 34 °C. Cultures were diluted in broth medium then passed through membrane filters of various pore diameters, yielding similar results for all nine isolates. Diluted isolates were then tested for reversion, a method of genetic stabilization unique to some bacteria, in both broth and agar medium. No reversion was observed. Isolates were grown in broth medium with large (20%) and minute (0.2%) amounts of fetal bovine serum as a sterol source. Growth was inhibited in the latter, indicating dependence on an outside sterol source for growth. The 16S rRNA gene was sequenced, yielding a unique sequence, suggesting {{the discovery of a}} previously unidentified organism. The Brown study in 2001 further investigated the pathogenicity of the newly discovered M. alligatoris by inoculation of four healthy alligators with the bacteria and one control alligator inoculated with sterile broth. Three of the experimental alligators died within three weeks of inoculation. The surviving alligator tested free of M. alligatoris after 14 weeks, further supporting the researchers suspicions of the new isolate as the cause of the investigated symptoms.|$|E
