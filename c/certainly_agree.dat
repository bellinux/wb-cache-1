2500|$|Clarke {{has also}} {{exchanged}} criticism with Michael Scheuer, {{former chief of}} the Bin Laden Issue Station at the CIA. When {{asked to respond to}} Clarke's claim that Scheuer was [...] "a hothead, a middle manager who really didn't go to any of the cabinet meetings," [...] Scheuer returned the criticism as follows: [...] "I <b>certainly</b> <b>agree</b> with the fact that I didn't go to the cabinet meetings. But I'm certainly also aware that I'm much better informed than Mr. Clarke ever was {{about the nature of the}} intelligence that was available against Osama bin Laden and which was consistently denigrated by himself and Mr. Tenet." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Clearly," [...] {{said the}} Vicar, amused. [...] "By being contemptible we set men's minds, {{to the tune}} of contempt. I <b>certainly</b> <b>agree</b> with Miss Garth's view of the matter, whether I am {{condemned}} by it or not. But as to Fred Vincy, it is only fair he should be excused a little: old Featherstone's delusive behavior did help to spoil him. There was something quite diabolical in not leaving him a farthing after all. But Fred has the good taste not to dwell on that. And what he cares most about is having offended you, Mrs. Garth; he supposes you will never think well of him again." ...|$|E

50|$|According to some film critics, The Devil in a Convent parodies monastic life, {{suggesting}} a satirical {{view of the}} Catholic Church. Méliès almost <b>certainly</b> <b>agreed</b> with the anti-ecclesiastic emotions prevalent during the Dreyfus affair in 1898 and 1899; Méliès supported Alfred Dreyfus's case, while the Church opposed it. Méliès made another religious satire, The Temptation of Saint Anthony, in the same year, {{as well as his}} strongly pro-Dreyfus film series The Dreyfus Affair.|$|R
5000|$|William James learned pragmatism, {{this way}} of {{understanding}} an idea by its practical effects, from his friend Peirce, but he gave it new significance. (Which was not to Peirce's taste - he came to complain that James had [...] "kidnapped" [...] the term and eventually to call himself a [...] "pragmaticist" [...] instead.) Although James <b>certainly</b> <b>agreed</b> with Peirce and against Berkeley that general ideas exist as a psychological fact, he was a nominalist in his ontology: ...|$|R
60|$|Of {{course he}} was obliged to {{want to tell them}} a story; they {{expected}} it of him, and they were his employer's children. To be sure he had on mind something very practical and sensible he wished to say to Miss Olive, which had come to him during his solitary walk, and which he did not believe she would object to hearing, although he had said so much to her quite recently. As soon as he should begin to speak she would know that this was something she ought to know. It was about his mother, who had an income of her own, and did not in the least depend upon her son. Miss Olive would <b>certainly</b> <b>agree</b> with him that it was proper for him to tell her this.|$|E
60|$|I <b>certainly</b> <b>agree</b> with you, {{that in all}} {{probability}} we owe our whole Constitution to {{the restoration of the}} English monarchy. The state of things from which Monk relieved England was, however, by no means, at that time, so deplorable, in any sense, as yours is now, and under the present sway is likely to continue. Cromwell had delivered England from anarchy. His government, though military and despotic, had been regular and orderly. Under the iron, and under the yoke, the soil yielded its produce. After his death the evils of anarchy were rather dreaded than felt. Every man was yet safe in his house and in his property. But it must be admitted that Monk freed this nation from great and just apprehensions both of future anarchy and of probable tyranny in some form or other. The king whom he gave us was, indeed, the very reverse of your benignant sovereign, who, in reward for his attempt to bestow liberty on his subjects, languishes himself in prison. The person given to us by Monk was a man without any sense of his duty as a prince, without any regard to the dignity of his crown, without any love to his people,--dissolute, false, venal, and destitute of any positive good quality whatsoever, except a pleasant temper, and the manners of a gentleman. Yet the restoration of our monarchy, even in the person of such a prince, was everything to us; for without monarchy in England, most certainly we never can enjoy either peace or liberty. It was under this conviction that the very first regular step which we took, on the Revolution of 1688, was to fill the throne with a real king; and even before it could be done in due form, the chiefs of the nation did not attempt themselves to exercise authority so much as by interim. They instantly requested the Prince of Orange to take the government on himself. The throne was not effectively vacant for an hour.|$|E
6000|$|I {{believe that}} if a canvass of the entire civilized world were put to the vote in this matter, the {{proposition}} that it is desirable that the better sort of people should intermarry and have plentiful children, and that the inferior sort of people should abstain from multiplication, would be carried by an overwhelming majority. They might disagree with Plato's methods, [Footnote: The Republic, Bk. V.] but they would <b>certainly</b> <b>agree</b> to his principle. And {{that this is not}} a popular error Mr. Francis Galton has shown. He has devoted a very large amount of energy and capacity to the vivid and convincing presentation of this idea, and to its courageous propagation. His Huxley Lecture to the Anthropological Institute in 1901 [Footnote: Nature, vol. lxiv. p. 659.] puts the whole matter as vividly as it ever can be put. He classifies humanity about their average in classes which he indicates by the letters R S T U V rising above the average and r s t u v falling below, and he saturates the whole business in quantitative colour. Indeed, Mr. Galton has drawn up certain definite proposals. He has suggested that [...] "noble families" [...] should collect [...] "fine specimens of humanity" [...] around them, employing these fine specimens in menial occupations of a light and comfortable sort, that will leave a sufficient portion of their energies free for the multiplication of their superior type. [...] "Promising young couples" [...] might be given [...] "healthy and convenient houses at low rentals," [...] he suggests, and no doubt it could be contrived that they should pay their rent partly or entirely per stone of family annually produced. And he has also proposed that [...] "diplomas" [...] should be granted to young men and women of high class--big S and upward--and that they should be encouraged to intermarry young. A scheme of [...] "dowries" [...] for diploma holders would obviously be the simplest thing in the world. And only the rules for identifying your great S T U and V in adolescence, are wanting from the symmetrical completeness of his really very noble- spirited and high-class scheme.|$|E

5000|$|... it {{is unclear}} when {{transmissions}} began. [...] "The Big Tower" [...] claim that 405-line television from Llanddona started in January 1958, and the entrance plaque to the transmitter building <b>certainly</b> <b>agrees</b> that the mast and its building were built in 1958. Oddly, BBC research report 1963-50 does not mention a start date though it does point out that co-channel interference (presumably from Divis in Northern Ireland, about 180 km to the northwest across the Irish Sea) was [...] "severe". This caused the transmitter's useful service area to be smaller than planned, and forced {{the building of the}} Holyhead relay.|$|R

5000|$|This is {{also the}} ruling of the Maharik, Radvaz, and the Mahar"i of Minz.

5000|$|I've heard a {{lot about}} {{education}} and the need to hold teachers and schools accountable, and I <b>certainly</b> <b>agree</b> with that. But as an individual with an educational background, and also a parent, I have seen a lot of instances where the parents are unresponsive to the teachers or flat out uninvolved in their child's education. How do you intend to not only hold the teachers and schools accountable but also hold parents accountable? ...|$|E

60|$|But Father Malachi, in the {{neighbouring}} parish of Ballintubber, ran a course somewhat intermediate between these two. He, {{at the present}} moment, had no curate who interfered with his happiness. There was, indeed, a curate of Ballintubber--so named; but he lived away, not inhabiting the same house with Father Malachi, as is usual in Ireland; having a chapel to himself, and seldom making his way into {{our part of the}} country. Father Malachi was a strong-minded man, who knew the world. He, too, had an inclination for Home Rule, and still entertained a jealousy against the quasi-ascendency of a Protestant bishop; but he had no sympathy whatever with Father Brosnan. Ireland for the Irish might be very well, but he did not at all want to have Ireland for the Americans. Father Giles and Father Malachi <b>certainly</b> <b>agreed</b> on one thing--that Brosnan was a great trouble.|$|R
5000|$|All {{friends and}} acquaintances will <b>certainly</b> <b>agree</b> that Joshi was a most amiable and generous man, both privately and as a scholar. When necessary, however, {{for the sake of}} {{historical}} objectivity and scientific probity he could, tactfully though, speak out and even [...] "slaughter holy cows" [...] of outdated opinions and cherished convictions needing detached rectification or demythologisation. For instance, he was very critical of Swami Vivekananda's positions towards Buddhism, and also declared that celebrated exponents of the Sophia Perennis such as A. K. Coomaraswamy had not understood Buddhism properly.|$|E
5000|$|A December 2011 {{page on the}} Spinrite Web site {{says that}} an anomaly, which was named the [...] "Roger anomaly" [...] after its discoverer, is due to an error in the BIOS of some {{motherboards}} which does not affect normal use and hence may not be discovered. A motherboard with this problem will not work with Spinrite, although it is sometimes resolved in a later BIOS update. In case of a motherboard compatibility issue, Spinrite say that drives can always be temporarily connected to another motherboard where [...] "SpinRite will almost <b>certainly</b> <b>agree</b> to operate without trouble". Drive size is not mentioned as a factor.|$|E

5000|$|Draiman {{is married}} to former WWE Diva Lena Yada; they have a son, Samuel Bear Isamu Draiman, born in 2013. In {{politics}} he said [...] "I'm liberal about everything that is issue-based as far as ideology, but I'm also of the opinion of a very small government. I don't agree with the fiscal policies of the Democrats, but I <b>certainly</b> don't <b>agree</b> with the right-wing craziness of the Republicans." ...|$|R

5000|$|Berglund would <b>certainly</b> {{not always}} <b>agree</b> with composers, he felt {{comfortable}} in elaborating any nuances he considered important but which the composers had not highlighted. He believed in details: [...] "I {{think we have}} already had our fill of mushy recordings", Berglund noted in an interview by Finnish Music Quarterly (FMQ) in 1999.|$|R
5000|$|Still others, such as Harvard {{constitutional}} law professor Laurence Tribe, took an intermediate position: [...] Judge Taylor's is an unusually casual and surprisingly breezy way of dispatching the Bush administration's legal defense of its NSA warrantless surveillance program.... It's altogether {{too easy to}} make disparaging remarks {{about the quality of}} the Taylor opinion, which seems almost to have been written more to poke a finger in the President's eye than to please the legal commentariat or even, alas, to impress an appellate panel, although I <b>certainly</b> <b>agree</b> with the many who predict that, while her reasoning is bound not to be embraced, her bottom line is very likely to survive appellate review.|$|E
5000|$|The BBC said in 2015, [...] "The {{practice}} of casting white actors in non-white roles is still prevalent in Hollywood - despite widespread condemnation and protest." [...] A report in 2013 showed that 94% of film executives {{were white and}} that non-white people were under-represented as filmmakers and actors. The BBC explored two reasons for the casting practice: institutional racism and producers believing that well-known white actors attract more audiences and maximize profits. Thomas Rothman, the chairman of Sony Pictures said, [...] "I guess there's a certain institutional force and memory that exists out there... I think the industry's improving but I <b>certainly</b> <b>agree</b> with those who say we haven't come far enough fast enough." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sicilian antiquaries {{generally}} {{place it}} at Santa Maria di Licodia, which agrees {{well with the}} strong position of the city, but is certainly too distant from Catana. On the other hand, San Nicolo dell'Arena, a convent just above Nicolosi, which is regarded by Cluverius as the site, is too high up the mountain to have ever been on the high road from Catana to Centuripi. Mannert, however, speaks of ruins {{at a place called}} Castro, about 4 km northeast from Paternò, on a hill projecting from the foot of the mountain, which he regards as the site of Aetna, and which would <b>certainly</b> <b>agree</b> well with the requisite conditions. [...] This latter position is the consensus of most modern scholars.|$|E
50|$|In most of Europe, {{it is not}} {{possible}} for authors to assign or even waive their moral rights. This is following a tradition in European copyright itself, which is not regarded as an item of property which can be sold, but only licensed. Parties <b>certainly</b> can <b>agree</b> not to enforce them (and such terms are very common in contracts in Europe). There may also be a requirement for the author to 'assert' these moral rights before they can be enforced. In many books, for example, this is done on a page near the beginning, in and amongst the British Library/Library of Congress data.|$|R

The following year he became third justice of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland); [...] Francis Elrington Ball, in his definitive study of the Irish judiciary before 1921, thought that Boate was unqualified to be a judge, an opinion with which Jonathan Swift, who knew and loathed Boate, would most <b>certainly</b> have <b>agreed.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Bosley Crowther of The New York Times liked it: [...] "Let us {{be thankful}} that Paramount is still blessed with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, {{and that it}} has set its cameras to tailing these two irrepressible wags on another fantastic excursion, Road to Morocco, which came to the Paramount yesterday. For the screen, under present circumstances, can hold no more {{diverting}} lure than the prospect of Hope and Crosby ambling, as they have done before, through an utterly slaphappy picture, picking up Dorothy Lamour along the way and tossing acid wisecracks at each other without a thought for reason or sense...The short of it is that Road to Morocco is a daffy, laugh-drafting film.

5000|$|On March 1, Roosevelt assured Congress that [...] "I {{come from}} the Crimea with a firm belief {{that we have made}} a start on the road to a world of peace." [...] However, the Western Powers soon {{realized}} that Stalin would not honour his promise of free elections for Poland.

On March 11, Roosevelt responded to Churchill, writing, [...] "I most <b>certainly</b> <b>agree</b> that we must stand firm on a correct interpretation of the Crimean decision.
