Afterwards, the poly(dimethylsiloxane) / divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB) fiber was used with direct urine sample immersed for 60 sec under 1200 rpm magnetic stirring. Analysis with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was followed. For the determination of creatinine, the PDMS/DVB fiber was aslo directly immersed into urine sample for 60 sec under 1200 rpm magnetic stirring. Then the fiber was transferred to a 4 mL vial which was filled with 100 µL of trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA) and stood 30 sec for headspace extraction. Afterward the fiber was transferred again to another blank 4 mL vial and stood 10 min for on-fiber derivatization before the analysis with GC/MS.

In the present study, we investigated {{the possibility to}} use a triple quadrupole instrument {{for the analysis of}} this biomarker <b>in</b> <b>urine.</b> The two instruments were compared in terms of sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{generally}} recognized that <b>creatinine</b> <b>in</b> <b>urine</b> is formed spontaneously from creatine {{in the animal}} body { 1).

For ex-ample, in the case of diabetes, excretion of creatine in urine occurs to-gether with the decline of carbohydrate metabolism (2). The creatinu-ria owing to the starvation can be recovered by the administration of carbohydrate, but neither protein nor fat proves to be effective (if). The problem of the correlation between carbohydrate metabolism and the creatinine formation from creatine in yeast cells was studied by T. S o d a and K. S h i m o k a t a, who showed that the conversion in question occurred only when sugars were fermented by yeast cells (4), The authors investigated this problem once again and more pre-cisely. It was found that the creatinine formation was very small under aerobic condition compared with that under anaerobic condition when baker's yeast was used. Under aerobic condition, the fermentation was suppressed due to the P a s t e u r effect, and the creatinine formation may have been reduced. As the creatinine formation was completely in-hibited by NaN 3, phosphorylation may as well participate in this process.

Quantification of creatinine in biological fluids such as urine and plasma is important for clinical diagnosis {{as well as in}} biomonitoring programs and urinary metabolomics/metabonomics research.

In this paper, a novel reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for the determination of creatinine of high hydrophilicity by pre-column derivatization with ethyl chloroformate is presented. N-Ethyloxycarbonylation of creatinine significantly enhanced the hydrophobicity of creatinine, facilitating its chromatographic retention as well as quantification by HPLC. Factors governing the derivatization reaction were studied and optimized. The developed method was validated and applied for the determination of creatinine in rat urine samples.

40|$|Abstract The {{accuracy}} of methods for measurement of <b>creatinine</b> <b>in</b> plasma, <b>urine</b> and dialysate {{is of great}} importance in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dia-lysis (CAPD) patients, to assess the adequacy of CAPD (creatinine clearance) and to monitor the nutritional status (creatinine kinetic lean body mass). The methods most widely employed for creatinine determination are Jaffe's reaction and the enzymatic method, however these techniques may suffer from glucose interference, particularly for dialysate. We compared creatinine values obtained by Jaffe's reaction, the enzymatic method and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) for three creatinine calibration curves pre-pared in three dialysis solutions with various concentra-tions of glucose and for plasma, urine and dialysate o...|$|R
