The U.S. Geological Survey has conducted such research, addressing <b>coastal</b> <b>vulnerability</b> to sea level rise and incorporating six physical variables to analyze the changes in sea level: geomorphology; coastal slope (percent); rate of relative sea level rise (mm/yr); shoreline erosion and acceleration rates (m/yr); mean tidal range (m); and mean wave height (m). The research {{was conducted on the}} various coasts of the U.S., and the results are very useful for future reference. Along the Pacific coast, the most vulnerable areas are low-lying beaches, and “their susceptibility is primarily a function of geomorphology and coastal slope.” With regard to research performed along the Atlantic coast, the most vulnerable areas to sea level rise were found to be along the Mid-Atlantic coast (Maryland to North Carolina) and Northern Florida, since these are “typically high-energy coastlines where the regional coastal slope is low and where the major landform type is a barrier island.” For the Gulf coast, the most vulnerable areas are along the Louisiana-Texas coast. According to the results, “the highest-vulnerability areas are typically lower-lying beach and marsh areas; their susceptibility is primarily a function of geomorphology, coastal slope and rate of relative sea-level rise.” ...|$|E

A vast majority of <b>coastal</b> <b>vulnerability</b> assessments across the globe are evaluated at the macro level (city scale) {{but not at the}} micro level (small town scale); particularly in the United Kingdom (UK).

The training sites were manually classified based on four categories of <b>coastal</b> environmental <b>vulnerability</b> through meetings and interviews with experts having field experience and specific knowledge of the environmental problems investigated.

It assesses the physical <b>coastal</b> <b>vulnerability</b> to storm impacts by separately estimating two components: flooding and erosion. It covers the following steps: (i) {{characterization of the}} forcing, (ii) evaluation of the induced beach response – inundation and erosion – (hazards quantification), (iii) coastal zone characterization, (iv) definition of a <b>coastal</b> <b>vulnerability</b> index to storms – a composite of two partial vulnerability estimations, the flood vulnerability and the erosion vulnerability indices-, and (v) assessment of the <b>coastal</b> <b>vulnerability.</b> Instead of assessing the vulnerability associated with a given storm, the forcing is {{defined in terms of}} representative storms which are obtained by classifying storms in the area using a 5 -class system similar to that used for hurricanes (weak, moderate, significant, severe and extreme).

One of the most important goals of assessing <b>coastal</b> flood <b>vulnerability,</b> in particular, is to create a readily understandable link between the theoretical concepts of flood vulnerability and the day-to-day decision-making process and to encapsulate this link in an easily accessible tool. This article focuses on developing a C astal City Flood Vulnerability Index (CCFVI) based on exposure, susceptibility and resilience to coastal flooding. It is applied to nine cities around the world, each with different kinds of exposure. With the aid of this index, it is demonstrated which cities are most vulnerable to coastal flooding with regard to the system’s components, that is, hydro-geological, socio-economic and politico-administrative. The index gives a number from 0 to 1, indicating comparatively low or high <b>coastal</b> flood <b>vulnerability,</b> which shows which cities are most in need of further, more detailed investigation for decision-makers. Once its use to compare the vulnerability of a range of cities under current conditions has been demonstrated, it is used to study the impact of climate change on the vulnerability of these cities over a longer timescale.

However, evaluation of the link between cholera in people and environment can only be effective with analysis of human <b>vulnerability</b> to variable <b>coastal</b> cholera ecologies.

40|$|Among a {{wide variety}} of coastal {{demersal}} fish species, the marine catfishes 	 assume prime dominance, by virtue of their abundance in the <b>coastal</b> grounds, 	 <b>vulnerability,</b> migration and behavior. Compared to many other demersal fishes, 	 catfishes are within the affordable range of poor/middle class fish eaters. They 	 have a wide distributional range in the Indo-Pacific region, all along the Indian 	 coastal waters upto the middle shelf with preferential concentration on muddy 	 grounds of 30 - 70 m depths. They migrate both vertically (diurnal migration) and 	 horizontally (seasonal) in small schools to large shoals in response to seasonal 	 climatic / hydrographic variations, drift pattern, biology and reproductive behaviour 	 of the species. Although the young ones live at the bottom, the adults frequently 	 visit column/surface water and move in shoals along the prevailing drifts of the 	 southwest and southeast monsoon, and become amenable to a variety of fishing 	 gears...|$|R
40|$|Sea-level rise threatens coastal salt-marshes and {{mangrove}} forests {{around the}} world, {{and a key}} determinant of <b>coastal</b> wetland <b>vulnerability</b> is whether its surface elevation can keep pace with rising sea level. Globally, a large data gap exists because wetland surface and shallow subsurface processes remain unaccounted for by traditional vulnerability assessments using tide gauges. Moreover, those processes vary substantially across wetlands, so modelling platforms require relevant local data. The low-cost, simple, high-precision rod surface-elevation table–marker horizon (RSET-MH) method fills this critical data gap, can be paired with spatial data sets and modelling and is financially and technically accessible to every country with coastal wetlands. Yet, RSET deployment has been limited to a few regions and purposes. A coordinated expansion of monitoring efforts, including development of regional networks that could support data sharing and collaboration, is crucial to adequately inform coastal climate change adaptation policy at several scales...|$|R
40|$|A <b>Coastal</b> Community <b>Vulnerability</b> Index (CCVI) was {{constructed}} {{to evaluate the}} <b>vulnerability</b> of <b>coastal</b> communities (Buhangin, Pingit, Reserva, Sabang and Zabali) in the municipality of Baler, Aurora, Philippines. This index was composed of weighted averages of seven vulnerability factors namely; geographical, economic and livelihood, food security, environmental, policy and institutional, demographic, and capital good. Factor values were computed based on scores that described range of conditions that influence communities' susceptibility to hazard effects. Among the factors evaluated, economic and livelihood, policy and institutional and food security contributed to CCVI across communities. Only small variations on CCVI values (i. e., 0. 47 to 0. 53) were observed since factor values cancelled-out one another during combination process. Overall, Sabang received the highest CCVI, which was contributed mainly by geographical and demographic factors. This technique to determine factors that influenced communities' vulnerability can provide information for local governments in enhancing policies on risk mitigation and adaptation...|$|R
