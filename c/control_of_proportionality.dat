40|$|Historically, {{the debate}} about the {{existing}} confrontation between Public and Private Law dates back to the middle twentieth century, primarily to the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany (FCCG) on the Lüth case of 1958. Since then, the discussion has been gaining some space, even being considered the “full Constitutionalization of Law” (Vergrundrechtlichung des gesamten Rechts), on one hand, and celebrated as the full accomplishment of the fundamental rights (Alexy, 2009) [1], on the other. With the conflict between these two legal spheres (Public and Private Law), the legal protection of the fundamental rights was extended beyond its subjectivist affirmation, where individual rights were only confronted with the State. However, from that moment on, fundamental rights are seen {{as a consequence of the}} formation of objective principles, both determiners of legislative measures and inspirers of the legal order. They meant, therefore, the application of Law to individuals and, furthermore, allowed for the interpretation of the precepts of the German Civil Code (BGB) in direct harmony with fundamental rights. The Drittwirkug (irradiation of precepts) was acknowledged. Fundamental rights got free from the unilateral orientation towards the governmental intervention of the time and became universally valid (Grimm, 2006) [2]. Therefore, one might raise the following question: “how would the entailment of private law be applied to fundamental rights?”. German author Canaris (2003) [3] provides us with some orientation: the fundamental rights stand immediately given the norms of private law (dominant opinion), and this perspective is adopted by the FCCG, which has been trialling with a strong <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> and of prohibition of the excess in light of the norms of fundamental rights in confrontation with the norms of private law. In fact, how can we think the confrontation between the norms of Public Law and the ones of Private Law within Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) – which, eminently, are not controlled by the Judiciary? This question is currently debated from the perspective of the purpose of the CSR: the business ethics. On the other hand, human rights are consecrated on the international order and its application is unquestionable within companies. All companies must respect human rights of stakeholders. Hence, is there any entailment between the norms of Public Law (here, human rights) and the ones of CSR? This is the debate we intend to present at this conference...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} {{self-contained}} microfluidic alternate flow injection mixer (AFIM) employing piezoelectrically actuated, PDMS seal-valves to control injection. AFIMs employ pulsatile injection of liquids to enhance interface surface generation. By allowing <b>control</b> <b>of</b> pulse-volume <b>proportionality</b> by variation <b>of</b> the duty-cycle <b>of</b> the valve <b>control</b> signals, continuously variable ratio mixing is achieved without external fluid control components. Mixing {{is discussed in}} the context of 'rate of new surface generation', thus allowing comparison with laminating mixer designs. The prototype mixer employs a simple micromould fabrication technique to minimize reversible elastomer valve-seal adhesion and hence allow correct valve operation. The resulting A device has been characterized over a range of mixing ratios...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the <b>control</b> aspects <b>of</b> a {{hierarchical}} organization {{under the influence}} of "proportionality" policies are analyzed. Proportionality policies are those that restrict the recruitment to every level of the hierarchy (except the bottom most level or base level) to be in strict proportion to the promotions into that level. Both long term and short term control analysis have been discussed. In long term control the specific roles of the parameters of the system with regard to <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the shape and size of the system have been analyzed and yield suitable control strategies. In short term <b>control,</b> the attainability <b>of</b> a target or goal structure within a specific time from a given initial structure has been analyzed and yields the required recruitment strategies. The theoretical analyses have been illustrated with computational examples and also with real world data. The <b>control</b> <b>of</b> such <b>proportionality</b> systems is then compared with that of the general systems (which do not follow such policies) with some significant conclusions. The <b>control</b> relations <b>of</b> such <b>proportionality</b> systems are found to be simpler and more practically feasible than those of general Markov systems, which do not have such restrictions. Such proportionality systems thus not only retain and match the flexibility of general Markov systems but also have the added advantage of simpler and more practically feasible controls. The proportionality policies hence act as an alternative and more practicably feasible means <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> as a unique technique used in arguing judicial decisions dealing with fundamental rights disputes. I will contest that the principle <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> offers fixed steps of examination and makes the thought process of the court transparent. With this approach, conflicts of fundamental rights cannot be handled as zero-sum games, but as disputes {{in which it is}} possible to find a fair balance. Furthermore, the principle <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> offers a plausible method <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> the quality <b>of</b> judicial decisions. The function of the principle <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> can be identified from different perspectives. Its formal function is to promote a valid and proper judgment. However, after closer examination one can argue that the formal function of the method is to support (a) the justifiability of the decision, (b) the correctness of the legal interpretation, and (c) the transparency of the arguments used. Besides, there are convincing arguments that the principle <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> has also an important substantive function in (a) offering more effective protection for human rights, (b) deepening the values of the rule of law, and (c) strengthening the democratic character of the decision-making process by the verifiability of the judicial argumentation...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} role of the {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> within contract law, in balancing the rights and obligations of the contracting parties. It illustrates that the principle <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> is one <b>of</b> the general principles which govern contractual relations, and as such it is an underlying principle of more specific rules of EU contract law. Furthermore, it is investigated whether the principle <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> can in addition play a role as an autonomous principle, apart from more specific rules. Finally, some general conclusions about the principle <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> in contract law will be formulated...|$|R
40|$|The {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> is {{a central}} feature of international law regulating modern military engagements. Yet the legal status <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> in international law is far from clear. Two major international treaties—the Rome Statute and the 1978 Additional Protocol to the Geneva Convention—address war crimes and provide distinct definitions {{of the crime of}} disproportionate use of force. Many of the world’s major military powers are not signatories to either treaty. Consequently, the only framework of legal accountability for alleged proportionality violations committed by those nations is customary international law. Furthermore, in non-international conflicts no treaty law respecting proportionality exists, meaning that customary international law again is the only binding law available. Given the importance of the definition <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> to policing modern military conflicts, reducing ambiguity regarding the legal elements <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> would be a salutary development. This Comment, drawing on doctrinal and realist policy analyses, argues that the legal elements <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> in customary international law can be clarified through the adoption of the definition <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> provided by the Rome Statute as customary international law...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyse the extent of {{judicial}} review exercised by the EU courts over the European Commission’s decision imposing fines in EU competition law. When considering appeals against fines in competition law, the position of the EU courts are limited to a review of imposed fines in respect of the European Commission’s Guidelines instead of an exercise of a more comprehensive appellate review. The review should not only be a <b>control</b> <b>of</b> legality but it has to be an unlimited merits control. An appeal control should be directed to review fully the facts and to <b>control</b> <b>proportionality</b> <b>of</b> the imposed fines. The article analyses also the question of the protection of fundamental rights in the scope of the review over decisions imposing fines. For that purpose, the article provides also a comparative analysis of the selected judgments of the EU courts and the European Court of Human Rights. Michał Mija...|$|R

Despite the absence <b>of</b> reference to <b>proportionality</b> or balancing in most State constitutions or international conventions, scholars and judges alike have embraced a vocabulary of proportion, cost, weight, and balance.

40|$|The {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> {{applies to}} competition proceedings especially, {{when it comes}} to the exercise by the competition authority of its powers of inspection. Their use limits the economic freedom and right to privacy of the scrutinised undertakings in order to protect free competition. The use of inspection powers must thus be proportionate and remain the least onerous possible for the inspected companies. In consequence, legislation must provide procedural guarantees <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> <b>of</b> inspections. This article analyses whether the powers of inspection bestowed upon the Polish competition authority are regulated in a way that guarantees the observance of the principle <b>of</b> <b>proportionality.</b> The analysis focuses on the powers <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and search. Subsequently covered is also the issue <b>of</b> judicial <b>control</b> over the use of the powers of inspection by the competition authority. Proposals for changes in the practice of the competition authority as well as in the Polish legal framework are made in conclusion. ...|$|R

40|$|This master's thesis {{looks at}} the current stand of {{international}} investment law {{with regard to the}} perceived colliding of interests between foreign investor protection and host states’ right to regulate. At the beginning of this millennium, this conflict was solved rather differently by various investment tribunals. By analysing the relevant awards of 2016 this thesis shows that investment tribunals now address the issue in a more uniform way and that they take account of public welfare as well as the foreign investor. The current doctrine of international invest-ment law thus seems to be more balanced. The principle <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> is an important concept in this thesis as the analysis of the investment awards of 2016 is conducted through the lens of this principle. This thesis argues that the principle <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> merely is a semantic structure explaining ordinary legal reasoning; the criteria of suitability and necessity establishes whether a legitimate legal conflict of rights and interests exists and the criterion <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> in the narrow sense orders these rights and interests according to the underlying legal doctrine. The analysis of the international investment awards of 2016 is both an assessment of whether and how interna-tional investment tribunals explicitly apply the technique of the principle <b>of</b> <b>proportionality,</b> as well as an investigation of whether the semantic structure of the principle <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> explains the tribunals’ reasoning...|$|R
40|$|The {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> {{is used in}} {{many different}} contexts. Some of these uses and contexts are first briefly indicated. This paper focusses {{on the use of}} this principle as a moral principle. I argue that under certain conditions the principle <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> is helpful as a guide in decision-making. But it needs to be clarified and to be used with some flexibility as a context-dependent principle. Several interpretations of the principle are distinguished, using three conditions as a starting point: importance of objective, relevance of means, and most favourable option. The principle is then tested against an example, which suggests that a fourth condition, focusing on non-excessiveness, needs to be added. I will distinguish between three main interpretations of the principle, some primarily with uses in research ethics, others with uses in other areas of bioethics, for instance in comparisons of therapeutic means and ends. The relations between the principle <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> and the precautionary principle are explored in the following section. It is concluded that the principles are different and may even clash. In the next section the principle <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> is applied to some medical examples drawn from research ethics and bioethics. In concluding, the status of the principle <b>of</b> <b>proportionality</b> as a moral principle is discussed. What has been achieved so far and what remains to be done is finally summarized...|$|R
