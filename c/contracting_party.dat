5|$|The Finns {{had many}} reasons {{to turn down the}} Soviet proposals. Finland had started {{negotiations}} for a military co-operation with Sweden, and the Finns had great hopes for the joint Finnish–Swedish defense for the Ålands islands {{and did not want to}} jeopardize these negotiations. In addition, the violent collectivization, purges, show trials and executions in Stalin's Soviet Union had given the country a bad reputation. Furthermore, most of the Finnish Communist leadership in the Soviet Union was executed during the Great Purge. The Soviet Union did not therefore seem to be a reliable <b>contracting</b> <b>party.</b> The Soviet envoys sent to negotiate with Finns were officially of relatively low rank, but as Väinö Tanner put it later, the Finns assumed rightly that they represented of some higher organ of State, probably the Soviet secret police NKVD.|$|E

25|$|Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire were {{contracts}} {{between the}} Ottoman Empire and European powers, particularly France.

40|$|Classically, {{the root}} of the {{contract}} is the agreement of the <b>contracting</b> <b>parties.</b> That is why, sometime people consider the contract as the agreement of the <b>contracting</b> <b>parties.</b> However, the agreement is not the contract. The both are different. In fact, if for the <b>contracting</b> <b>parties</b> there is a contract after an agreement, for the law there is a contract when the agreement of the <b>contracting</b> <b>parties</b> respects the frame previewed by the law. That is why the contract must be an institution. This view of the contract enables to have another meaning and to gather the keys ideas of the different opinions on the meaning of the contract. Thanks to the contract as an institution, we can no longer be afraid of the crisis of the contract...|$|R

25|$|A {{project manager}} {{is often a}} client {{representative}} and has to determine and implement the exact needs of the client, based on knowledge of the firm they are representing.

25|$|Unilateral mistake {{occurs when}} only one party to a {{contract}} is mistaken as to the terms or subject-matter. The courts will uphold such a contract unless it was determined that the non-mistaken party was aware of the mistake and tried {{to take advantage of the}} mistake. HCA 5] It is also possible for a contract to be void if there was a mistake in the identity of the <b>contracting</b> <b>party.</b> An example is in Lewis v. Avery where Lord Denning MR held that the contract can only be voided if the plaintiff can show that, at the time of agreement, the plaintiff believed the other party's identity was of vital importance. A mere mistaken belief as to the credibility of the other party is not sufficient.|$|E

2500|$|Misrepresentation in English {{contract}} law and English tort law {{refers to a}} situation where a person is induced {{to enter into a}} contract entirely or partly by a false assertion (of fact, not opinion or intention) made by the other <b>contracting</b> <b>party.</b> Claims that can be described as sales talk, such as advertising slogans, are not misrepresentations. If a misrepresentation is incorporated as a term of the contract, it may form the basis of an action for breach of contract, and contractual remedies. If not, the misrepresentee (the party influenced by the misrepresentation of the other party) may be able to rescind (withdraw from) the contract or obtain damages. A misrepresentation may be [...] made fraudulently, negligently, or non‐negligently (innocently). A related term is [...] "misstatement": a false assertion that causes harm other than by inducing a person to enter a contract. Contract law deals with the contractual implications of misrepresentation; in most cases English law allows escape from a bargain when a <b>contracting</b> <b>party</b> has not given true consent due to misrepresentation. Tort law deals with civil wrongs and remedies.|$|E
2500|$|Not every {{statement}} spoken {{without the}} utmost truth is a misrepresentation. It is generally {{said that the}} statement must be one asserting something as a fact, {{rather than as an}} opinion, and that statements of intention are not statements of fact. However, opinions and intentions can overlap with facts. [...] It is not considered misrepresentation when a <b>contracting</b> <b>party</b> does not correct an error in his favour made by the other party.|$|E

2500|$|Phillips v Brooks Ltd, however stands tensely {{with another}} area of the law known as the {{doctrine}} of [...] "mistake as to identity". The House of Lords by a thin majority recently reaffirmed in Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson that when a contract is done at a distance, but where {{the identity of the}} <b>contracting</b> <b>party</b> is essential to the transaction, the contract will ex ante be void. In these cases, the courts have deviated from a normal misrepresentation and bar to rescission analysis.|$|E

2500|$|The Ottoman Public Debt Administration (OPDA) was a European-controlled {{organization}} that {{was established in}} 1881 to collect the payments which the Ottoman Empire owed to European companies in the Ottoman public debt. The OPDA became a vast, essentially independent bureaucracy within the Ottoman bureaucracy, run by the creditors. It employed 5,000 officials who collected taxes that were then {{turned over to the}} European creditors. [...] Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire (ahdnames) were generally bilateral acts whereby definite arrangements were entered into by each <b>contracting</b> <b>party</b> towards the other, not mere concessions, grants made by successive Sultans to Christian nations, conferring rights and privileges in favor of their subjects (Christians/Minorities) resident or trading in the Ottoman dominions, to establish the policy towards European states.|$|E

5000|$|The {{core of the}} Forum's work {{is based}} around the [...] "1958 Agreement", {{formally}} titled [...] "Agreement concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted {{on the basis of}} these prescriptions" [...] (E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.2, amended on 16 October 1995). This forms a legal framework wherein participating countries (<b>contracting</b> <b>parties)</b> agree on a common set of technical prescriptions and protocols for type approval of vehicles and components. These were formerly called [...] "UNECE Regulations" [...] or, less formally, [...] "ECE Regulations" [...] in reference to the Economic Commission for Europe. However, since many non-European countries are now <b>contracting</b> <b>parties</b> to the 1958 Agreement, the regulations are officially entitled [...] "UN Regulations". Each <b>contracting</b> <b>party's</b> type approvals are recognised by all other <b>contracting</b> <b>parties.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Soon {{after the}} 1967 war, Israel issued a {{military}} order {{stating that the}} Geneva Conventions applied to the recently occupied territories, but this order was rescinded a few months later. For a number of years, Israel argued on various grounds that the Geneva Conventions do not apply. [...] One is the Missing Reversioner theory which argued that the Geneva Conventions apply only to the sovereign territory of a High <b>Contracting</b> <b>Party,</b> and therefore do not apply since Jordan never exercised sovereignty over the region. However, that interpretation is not shared by the international community. The application of Geneva Convention to Occupied Palestinian Territories was further upheld by International Court of Justice, UN General Assembly, UN Security Council and the Israeli Supreme Court.|$|E
2500|$|The 28 {{states of}} the European Union are dually represented, as the EU is a full member of the organization. Non-sovereign {{autonomous}} entities of member states are eligible for full membership in the WTO provided {{that they have a}} separate customs territory with full autonomy in the conduct of their external commercial relations. Thus, Hong Kong became a GATT <b>contracting</b> <b>party,</b> by the now terminated [...] "sponsorship" [...] procedure of the United Kingdom (Hong Kong uses the name [...] "Hong Kong, China" [...] since 1997), as did Macau. A new member of this type is the Republic of China (Taiwan), which acceded to the WTO in 2002, and carefully crafted its application by joining under the name [...] "Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (Chinese Taipei)" [...] so that they were not rejected {{as a result of the}} People's Republic of China One-China policy.|$|E
2500|$|Countries {{party to}} the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic have uniform rules about {{overtaking}} and lane designation. [...] The convention details (amongst other things) that [...] "Every driver shall keep {{to the edge of}} the carriageway appropriate to the direction of traffic", and the [...] "Drivers overtaking shall do so on the side opposite to that appropriate to the direction of traffic", notwithstanding the presence or absence of oncoming traffic. Allowed exceptions to these rules include turning or heavy traffic, traffic in lines, or situation in which signs or markings must dictate otherwise. These rules must be more strictly adhered to on roads with oncoming traffic, but still apply on multi-lane and divided highways. Many countries in Europe are {{party to the}} Vienna Conventions on traffic and roads. In Australia (which is not a <b>contracting</b> <b>party),</b> traveling in any lane other than the [...] "slow" [...] lane on a road with a speed limit at or above [...] is an offence, unless signage is posted to the contrary or the driver is overtaking.|$|E
