5|$|In the 1980s, economists Daniel Khazzoom and Leonard Brookes {{revisited}} the Jevons paradox for {{the case}} of society's energy use. Brookes, then <b>chief</b> <b>economist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> UK Atomic Energy Authority, argued that attempts to reduce energy consumption by increasing energy efficiency would simply raise demand for energy in {{the economy as a}} whole. Khazzoom focused on the narrower point that the potential for rebound was ignored in mandatory performance standards for domestic appliances being set by the California Energy Commission.|$|E

25|$|Stiglitz wrote {{a series}} of papers and held {{a series of}} {{conferences}} explaining how such information uncertainties may have influence on everything from unemployment to lending shortages.

For example, he was an outspoken critic of quickly opening up financial markets in developing countries. These markets rely on access to good financial data and sound bankruptcy laws, but he argued that many of these countries didn't have the regulatory institutions needed to ensure that the markets would operate soundly.|$|E

25|$|The city's TIF {{financing}} proposal was controversial. Critics such as Charles W. McMillion (<b>chief</b> <b>economist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> business consulting firm MBG Information Services) {{argued that the}} convention headquarters hotel would lead to lower sales tax revenue by reducing pressure on hotel room rates throughout the city and by keeping attendees away from local restaurants and retail businesses. The convention headquarters hotel, critics also noted, would not have enough attendance {{to make up the}} lost sales tax revenue. Executives at other hotel chains said the city's financing deal projected sales tax revenue of $40 million to $48 million a year, but a more reasonable estimate was $25 million to $30 million a year. City officials countered by pointing to the two studies conducted in 2000 which came to different conclusions, and by noting that the convention center had promised those booking large meetings at the site that a headquarters hotel would be open by 2007. Without the hotel, these groups could cancel completely, they said.|$|E

2500|$|Kenneth Rogoff, Professor of Economics and Public Policy at Harvard University, and {{formerly}} <b>Chief</b> <b>Economist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> IMF, {{argues that}} [...] "Higher transactions taxes increase {{the cost of}} capital, ultimately lowering investment. With a lower capital stock, output would trend downward, reducing government revenues and substantially offsetting the direct gain from the tax. In the long run, wages would fall, and ordinary workers would end up bearing a significant share of the cost. More broadly, FTTs violate the general public-finance principle that it is inefficient to tax intermediate factors of production, particularly ones that are highly mobile and fluid in their response." ...|$|E
