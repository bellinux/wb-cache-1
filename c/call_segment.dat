30|$|Segment C, {{where the}} {{epicenter}} of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake is located, may have a potential to generate a large earthquake, as already mentioned, while its adjacent two segments, Segments B and D, do not. Following a recent popular term in seismology, we may <b>call</b> <b>Segment</b> C a segment with strong asperities while Segments B and D have no, or very minor, asperities. This dramatic variability among along-strike segments, including segments of weak plate coupling, is very striking. Thus, the idea that no megathrust earthquakes are likely in the Tohoku subduction zone appeared reasonable before 2011. The interaction between deep and shallow segments, Segments C and C', is considered essential for causing an M 9 earthquake; their combined slips may have triggered large slips in adjacent along-strike segments (Segments B and D) of relatively weak plate coupling where no large slips can happen if they fail by themselves.|$|E
40|$|The Firing Squad Synchronization Problem (FSSP), one of {{the most}} {{well-known}} problems related to cellular automata, was originally proposed by Myhill in 1957 and became famous through the work of Moore [1]. The first solution to this problem was given by Minsky and McCarthy [2] and a minimal time solution was given by Goto [3]. A significant amount of research has also dealt with variants of this problem. In this paper, from a theoretical interest, we will extend this problem to number patterns on a seven-segment display. Some of these problems can be generalized as the FSSP for some special trees called segment trees. The FSSP for segment trees can be reduced to a FSSP for a one-dimensional array divided evenly by joint cells that we <b>call</b> <b>segment</b> array. We will give algorithms to solve the FSSPs for this segment array and other number patterns, respectively. Moreover, we will clarify the minimal time to solve these problems and show that there exists no such solution...|$|E

40|$|Changes in the {{cytoarchitecture}} {{of vocal}} control nuclei were investigated in nestling budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) from hatching to fledging (five to six weeks) {{in relation to}} changes in vocalizations produced by nestlings during this period. The nuclei investigated were the hypoglossal nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus of the intercollicular midbrain, central nucleus of the archistriatum, central nucleus of the lateral neostriatum, oval nucleus of the hyperstriatum ventrale, medial division of the oval nucleus of the anterior neostriatum, and magnocellular nucleus of the lobus parolfactorius. These nuclei {{have been shown to}} form functional circuits in adults related to vocal learning. Consistent with previously reported results, we found that call development could be described in terms of five different phases based on changes in the duration and segmentation of single and multiple segment foodbegging calls and the appearance of the first socially learned contact calls around the time of fledging. We also found that <b>call</b> <b>segment</b> duration exhibited an inverted U-shaped developmental function during the nestling period, as has been found for total call duration. Cytoarchitectonic studies revealed striking changes in the cellular architecture of vocal control nuclei during the first four weeks posthatching. At hatching the hypoglossal nucleus exhibits adult-like cytoarchitecture, and the central nucleus of the archistriatum and the central nucleus of the lateral neostriatum are distinguishable from surrounding fields. By one week posthatch, the central nucleus of the archistriatum exhibits an adult-like appearance, while other telencephalic vocal control nuclei do not exhibit adult-like cytoarchitecture until three to four weeks posthatching. By two weeks posthatching, the dorsomedial nucleus of the intercollicular midbrain also exhibits adult-like cytoarchitecture. We observed substantial decreases in the thickness of ventricular proliferation zones during this period, with decreases in ventricular zones occurring at about the same point that nuclei at corresponding levels come to exhibit adult-like cytoarchitectonic features. Of interest is the fact that cytoarchitectural development occurs asynchronously in different brain regions, with the appearance of adult-like characteristics in the hindbrain and midbrain occurring before the appearance of adult-like cytoarchitectonic characteristics in telencephalic nuclei. These results are consistent with recent lesion studies indicating that neither auditory feedback nor telencephalic vocal control nuclei are necessary for the production of foodbegging and other nestling calls until three to four weeks posthatching...|$|E

40|$|We studied {{how certain}} {{patterns}} of acoustic overlap and signal dropout impact the attractiveness to females of male {{calls in the}} gray treefrog. A main question was whether females are able to compensate for masked or missing <b>call</b> <b>segments</b> by using a process analogous to 2 ̆ 2 phonemic restoration 2 ̆ 2 in humans. This is when the brain reconstructs masked segments of words. Methods: We captured female treefrogs in a pond and then offered them a choice {{of different kinds of}} computer-generated synthetic calls in an indoor testing chamber. Females indicated a mating preference by moving toward one of two speakers that were broadcasting the call alternatives. Results: We found that females do not employ phonemic restoration to 2 ̆ 2 fill in 2 ̆ 2 missing <b>call</b> <b>segments.</b> However, although <b>call</b> overlap reduces call attractiveness, if a sufficient percent of call elements are not acoustically degraded, females may ignore perceived call abnormalities. Implications: Our data indicate that these treefrogs may need to rely on behavioral strategies to reduce the harmful effects of acoustic interference.
