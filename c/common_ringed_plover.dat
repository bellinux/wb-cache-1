25|$|The area {{is known}} for its {{diversity}} of birds, with 212 species having been recorded as of 1987. Of these, 68 commonly breed, 30 breed occasionally, and 14 which have bred previously. Common birds include the black-throated loon, the bean goose and various species of ducks. Egg-gathering was previously popular from the common goldeneye. Common predator birds include the rough-legged buzzard and merlin, while the white-tailed eagle and golden eagle are less common. The short-eared owl is the most common owl. Waders are abundant along the river, the most common being <b>common</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plover,</b> ruff and spotted redshank. Other common birds are the common gull, Arctic tern and sparrows.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Common</b> <b>Ringed</b> <b>Plover</b> (Jian-Heng or Jianheng, 剑鸻) is a fixed wing UAV {{developed}} by NCHU, which can take-off either on water or on land. The <b>Common</b> <b>Ringed</b> <b>Plover</b> made its public debut in September 2013 at the 2nd AVIC Cup international UAV innovation competition, and placed 17th {{out of a}} total of 76 designs.|$|E
50|$|As {{a marine}} {{protected}} area the site {{is important for the}} <b>common</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plover</b> (Charadrius hiaticula), common greenshank (Tringa nebularia), eel grass and tide-swept algae, and for its inter-tidal, salt marsh, muddy gravel, and sheltered mud environments.|$|E
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers</b> are migratory {{and winter}} in coastal areas south to Africa. In Norway, geolocators have {{revealed}} that adult breeding birds migrate to West Africa. Many birds in Great Britain and northern France are resident throughout the year.|$|R
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plover's</b> {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} open ground on beaches or flats across northern Eurasia and in Arctic northeast Canada. Some birds breed inland, and in western Europe they nest {{as far south}} as northern France. They nest on the ground in an open area with little or no plant growth.|$|R
50|$|The {{habitat of}} the Fairy Pools hosts {{a variety of}} animals, such as red deer, rabbits, and sheep. The area is also host to {{a large number of}} birds. Large flocks of crows, ravens, and gulls are present in the area, as well as such smaller birds as meadow pipits, turnstones, <b>common</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers,</b> grey herons, dunlins, and curlews. The {{physical}} landscape is predominately rocky, with some boggy areas here and there. The water in the area is typically cold.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the birds migrating through, some seven million wading birds from the north spend the winter in the estuaries and wetlands of the Iberian Peninsula, mainly at locations on the Atlantic coast. In Galicia are Ría de Arousa (a home of grey plover), Ria de Ortigueira, Ria de Corme and Ria de Laxe. In Portugal, the Aveiro Lagoon hosts Recurvirostra avosetta, the <b>common</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plover,</b> grey plover and little stint. Ribatejo Province on the Tagus supports Recurvirostra arosetta, grey plover, dunlin, bar-tailed godwit and common redshank. In the Sado Estuary are dunlin, Eurasian curlew, grey plover and common redshank. The Algarve hosts red knot, common greenshank and turnstone. The Guadalquivir Marshes region of Andalusia and the Salinas de Cádiz are especially rich in wintering wading birds: Kentish plover, <b>common</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plover,</b> sanderling, and black-tailed godwit in {{addition to}} the others. And finally, the Ebro delta is home to all the species mentioned above.|$|E
5000|$|The little {{ringed plover}} (Charadrius dubius) is a small plover. The genus name Charadrius is a Late Latin word for a {{yellowish}} bird mentioned in the fourth-century Vulgate. It derives from Ancient Greek kharadrios a bird found in river valleys (kharadra, [...] "ravine"). The specific dubius is Latin for doubtful, since Sonnerat, writing in 1776, thought this bird might be just a variant of <b>common</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plover.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>common</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plover</b> or {{ringed plover}} (Charadrius hiaticula) {{is a small}} plover that breeds in Arctic Eurasia. The genus name Charadrius is a Late Latin word for a {{yellowish}} bird mentioned in the fourth-century Vulgate. It derives from Ancient Greek kharadrios a bird found in ravines and river valleys (kharadra, [...] "ravine"). The specific hiaticula is Latin and has a similar meaning to the Greek term, coming from hiatus, [...] "cleft" [...] and -cola, [...] "dweller" [...] (colere, [...] "to dwell").|$|E

500|$|Two small islets, {{close to}} the island, called Lissroy and Lihoumel, are {{breeding}} places {{for a number of}} endangered species of birds, including Eurasian oystercatchers and <b>common</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers.</b> Numerous other species of birds and plants are found on Lihou such as peregrine falcons and sea storksbill. The Guernsey Environment Department does not allow visitors to go to the two islets and the shingle bank at certain times of the year in order to allow the birds to breed. Approximately [...] north of the island is a submerged ledge called Grand Etacre, which was considered to be a hazard to navigation in the nineteenth century.|$|R
50|$|Works {{have been}} {{undertaken}} {{to protect and}} improve the habitats for wetland birds, including refuge islands, deep water channels and reed beds. Waders that breed regularly include northern lapwing, <b>common</b> redshank, <b>ringed</b> <b>plover</b> and little <b>ringed</b> <b>plover.</b> The first successful inland breeding in the British Isles of pied avocet was at this reservoir. Other birds recorded include smew, garganey, Temminck's stint, spotted crake and red-necked phalarope.|$|R
50|$|The caribou is {{the most}} {{important}} animal seen in the park. Arctic fox, Arctic hare and Polar bear are also seen in the park.

50|$|Kittlitz’s plover forages in {{a typical}} run-stop-search fashion, meaning it runs around, stops {{suddenly}} to peck at an item and then continues running. Sometimes, an individual stands erect with one foot vibrating on the surface (foot-trembling), then lunges forward to catch any prey that has been attracted to the surface. This behaviour has not been reported in Madagascar.They feed day and night (on moonlit nights until 11PM) often in groups of 2-5 individuals or in small mixed flocks together with other small waders like the Calidris species. When foraging, they can show an aggressive behaviour, especially towards conspecifics and species with similar diets, e.g. curlew sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea) or <b>common</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plover</b> (Charadrius hiaticula). The aggression increases with density and is particularly high in the winter months before breeding. They mainly feed on insects, especially beetles, insect larvae, spiders, small crustaceans and molluscs. Most of their food is small, but they were recorded to have taken a cricket that was about 40 mm long.|$|E
50|$|The {{lake and}} smaller pools {{are home to}} a wide range of water fowl and also play host to {{migrating}} birds. Among the species that attract birdwatchers to the hide are the goosander, lapwings, <b>common</b> snipe, little <b>ringed</b> <b>plover</b> and whitethroat.|$|R
50|$|This new marsh, {{together}} with another, {{designed to be}} managed as a brackish marsh with lagoons, now forms an RSPB reserve. Freiston Shore is home to pied avocets, <b>common</b> redshanks, <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers,</b> northern wheatears and marsh harriers in spring and summer. In the autumn and winter migrating waders such as common redshanks, ruddy turnstones, dunlins, and waterfowl such as dark-bellied brent goose and Eurasian wigeon, can be seen.|$|R
50|$|The main summer {{breeding}} birds {{seen on the}} reserve include <b>common</b> tern, little <b>ringed</b> <b>plover,</b> oystercatcher and many more.

Coot are a common breeder on the reserve but are often less successful.|$|R
40|$|Dredging and/or dumping actions at coastal environments are {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} worldwide. The re-working of dumped sediments from their disposal sites to places of great ecological value can {{have a very strong}} impact on the ecosystems through deep changes over the communities and the trophic web. Using a relevant dredging-dumping episode carried out in 2003 at Urdaibai, one the chief estuary areas in northern Iberia, we tested the consequence of this action on the subsequent use of the zone by shorebirds. The surface sediment characteristics before and after the dredging and dumping actions were also compared. The dredging at Urdaibai showed a negative effect on bird abundance in three out of the eight species tested overall (dunlin, grey plover, <b>common</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plover).</b> Highest-ranked models supported a decrease in their population sizes two years after the event. In this scenario, local authorities should be appealed to take dredging and dumping effects into account in order to improve the estuary management. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
30|$|Uncontaminated or {{slightly}} contaminated dredged material from maintenance and capital dredging {{of the city}} of Lübeck and private marinas is usually relocated to the dredged discharge pool ‘Am Stau’. The annual amount is approximately 10, 000  m 3 [8]. With an area of 24  ha, the dredged discharge pool is the last remaining disposal site of its kind within the city limits of Lübeck [8]. As well as for relocation at sea, assessments of physio-chemical sediment properties are mandatory. For the underlying soil of the dredged discharge pool, has higher geogenic and anthropogenic background values due to previous uses of the site, the indicating values for dredged material placement are to some extent higher than those for relocation at sea. Due to the relocation of dredged material, the area has evolved into a wetland-like site. It represents a valuable habitat for several birds (lapwing Vanellus vanellus; ruff Philomachus pugnax; <b>common</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plover</b> Charadrius hiaticula; common snipe Gallinago gallinago) and amphibian species, depending on on-going dredged material input. The area is also a stopover site for migrating birds and therefore has the status of a protected area under German Federal Law. Currently, a management concept for preserving this area is under development by the Lübeck Port Authority (LPA) in collaboration with local environmental authorities. Cessation of dredged material disposal would result in a deterioration of ecological quality as happened at the close-by dredged disposal pool ‘Kattegatt’ suffering from severe drying-up effects.|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the {{fluctuations in the}} number of breeding pairs in the Special Protected Area under the Bird Directive ‘Kustbroedvogels te Zeebrugge-Heist’ and in the western port of Zeebrugge. These are by far the most important breeding sites for coastal breeders in Belgium and used to be of high importance for the biogeographical population as a whole. The quality of the breeding sites and the foraging areas is discussed and advice is given for a better management of the Special Protected Area. The populations of terns (Sandwich, Common and Little Tern) and Black-headed Gulls have decreased strongly since 2008 and the breeding success was insufficient for a stable population size. In Zeebrugge all 3 tern species used to exceed the threshold of 1 % of their respective biogeographic population considerably. In 2014 none of the tern species reached this threshold. The decrease is due to persistent problems with land predators. Food availability seemed to play no role in this. Also some scarce species strongly declined in Zeebrugge. Crested Lark, Northern Wheatear, Mediterranean Gull and Yellow-legged Gull used to breed in the Zeebrugge port but in 2014 these species were no longer recorded. The numbers of Oystercatchers and Common Gull seem to have stabilised at a level much lower than before. Only the population of <b>Common</b> <b>Ringed</b> <b>Plover</b> is rather stable at about 8 pairs. Following a slight reduction in 2013, the populations of Herring and Lesser Black-backed Gulls further and strongly declined in 2014. Both species used to exceed the 1 % level (maxima of 1. 2 and 2. 8 %, respectively for Herring and Lesser Black-backed Gull), the number of Herring Gulls dropped to 0. 2 % of the total biogeographic population while that of Lesser Black-backed Gull dropped to 0. 6 %. This decline is due to disturbance by foxes and a decreased availability of suitable nesting areas...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we compare autumn {{migration}} strategies in two subspecies of the <b>Common</b> <b>Ringed</b> <b>Plover</b> Charadrius hiaticula in the southern Baltic Sea. This species exhibits a leap-frog migration pattern, whereby northerly breeding populations (C. h. tundrae; henceforth tundrae) migrate past {{the whole range of}} the southern population (C. h. hiaticula; henceforth hiaticula). Hiaticula migrates the shortest distance and is hypothesised to minimize energy spent on migration, whereas tundrae is hypothesized to minimize time, because a longer migration imposes time constraints upon other stages of a migrant's life history, such as moult and breeding. We use biometric data collected at Ottenby Bird Observatory, southern Öland, Sweden, between 1946 - 2012, to test whether each subspecies demonstrates characteristics associated with either an energy- or time-minimized migration. We used the decline in wing and total-head length over the season to distinguish the subspecies. Hiaticula migrated earlier in the season (July-mid August) compared to tundrae (late July-late September). Also the relative timing of age groups between the two subspecies differed. Juvenile and adult hiaticula migrated synchronized in time, whereas tundrae had two main periods of passage for adults (earlier) and juveniles (later). The timing fits that of other studies and gives complementary information about the passage in Europe. Juvenile tundrae showed a positive trend of observed fuel loads as the season progressed, whereas the other groups did not. Daily fuelling rates within the same season were low compared to other wader species that use Ottenby as a stopover and no difference between subspecies was found. However, tundrae stopped over for a shorter time compared with hiaticula. There was no difference in average migration speed between the subspecies, although tundrae had a higher maximum speed. There was large variation in yearly numbers between age classes in the two subspecies. In hiaticula the yearly average was 8 adults and 37 juveniles. The ratio of juvenile to adult tundrae on the other hand was almost 1 : 1, indicating equal use of Ottenby as stop over site in autumn. No trends in observed fuel loads over the season in hiaticula are consistent with an energy minimizing migration. As for tundrae, a shorter stopover time compared to hiaticula and a positive relationship between observed fuel load and time, are consistent with time minimizing migration. However, there are many uncertainties and more studies of migratory behaviours at several sites along the migration route are needed to understand the differences in migration strategies in this species...|$|E
50|$|The river {{passes through}} or by Upottery, Rawridge, Monkton, Honiton (then below the A30 trunk road), Alfington, Ottery St Mary, Tipton St John, Newton Poppleford, Otterton and reaches {{the coast to}} the east of Budleigh Salterton, after flowing through the 57 acre Otter Estuary Nature Reserve - a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) - {{consisting}} of tidal mudflats and saltmarsh. There is no public access to the estuary itself but footpaths lead alongside with two viewing platforms on the west and two hides one on the west and one on the east.

40|$|Migratory {{connectivity}} can {{be defined}} as the flux of individuals or populations among areas between stages of an animal's life cycle. Many shorebird species perform long-distance migrations and while moving between breeding and wintering grounds, they depend on a network of intermediate wetlands (stopover sites) where populations of different origins extensively overlap. The difficulty to discriminate such populations represents a serious obstacle to the identification of the links between breeding or wintering areas and stopover sites, and also precludes the estimation of demographic parameters for each population. In this study, we test if linear discriminant models based on stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in toenails can be used to identify populations of several shorebird species of different wintering origins overlapping at two stopover sites of the East Atlantic Flyway. In addition, we evaluate the ability of this approach to infer migratory phenological patterns of shorebirds. Linear discriminant analyses performed overall well in distinguishing the isotopic signals of birds from wintering areas (in France, Portugal, Morocco, Mauritania and Guinea-Bissau) in most species, correctly classifying over 80 % (n = 542) of all wintering individuals sampled at these areas. Assignment rates of shorebirds captured during spring migration were also high (96 %, n = 323) at the Tejo estuary, Portugal, but lower (40 %, n = 185) at Marennes-Oléron Bay in France, and also differed among species. A large proportion of spring migrants captured in Portugal and France were assigned to Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania, the most important wintering area in the flyway. Phenological patterns derived for dunlins (Calidris alpina), <b>common</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>plovers</b> (Charadrius hiaticula) and grey plovers (Pluvialis squatarola) suggest that the first northward migrants started arriving at the Tejo estuary {{during the second half of}} March, with peaking numbers occurring during April or May...|$|R
