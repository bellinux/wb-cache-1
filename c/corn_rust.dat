40|$|Southern <b>corn</b> <b>rust</b> {{is one of}} {{destructive}} {{diseases in}} maize caused by Puccinia polysora Undrew. A mapping population of tropical sweet corn recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between hA 9104 and hA 9035 inbred lines were set up to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involved in partial resistance to southern <b>corn</b> <b>rust.</b> Eighty nine RILs were used to evaluate resistance levels using nine-point relative scale (1 - 9) at Sweet Seeds, Suwan Farm, Thailand in clude combined analysis. A genetic linkage map was constructed with 157 SSR markers, with a total length of 2123. 1 cM, covering 10 chromosomes. Broad-sense heritability of individual location ranged from 0. 76 and 0. 82 and combined across locations was 0. 87. Multiple QTL mapping (MQM) was applied for {{the identification of the}} QTLs. Fifteen QTLs were detected on chromosome 1, 2, 5, 6, 9 and 10 in both locations and combined across locations. QTLs on chromo some 1, 5 and 6 were contributed by alleles of resistant parent hA 9104 while others were contributed by alleles from the susceptible parent, hA 9035. Phenotypic variance of each QTL explained ranged from 6. 1 % to 41. 8 % with a total of 69. 8 % - 81. 9 %. QTL on chromosome 1, 6 and 10 were stable QTLs detected in both locations. </p...|$|E

The aim of the research was to know the resistance ofsome varieties of corn (Zea mays L.) {{and the influence of}} planting distance on leaf rust(Puccinia polysora) on lowland. The research was conducted at Tanjung Selamat village, Medan. The research used Cluster Random Design of 2 factorials with 9 treatments and 3 repetitions.

Rustdiseases {{consists}} of Southern rust, Common rust, and Tropical rust, has contracted causingsubstantial losses in maize in the world. Disease {{began to be}} seen attacking the corn crop inSouth Denpasar. The {{purpose of this study}} to determine the presence of rust disease on corn,contracted diseases, epidemiology, and weather factors that dominate affect diseaseprogression. Place of research conducted in South Denpasar, the time from April to June 2016. The study used survey methods {{at the center of the}} corn crop, and then determine thesample of plants by taking a random 20 corn plants in each plot, which was repeated 3 times. The results showed that the type of rust that attacks corn planting area in the south ofDenpasar was a kind of Southern <b>Corn</b> <b>Rust,</b> caused by the fungus Puccinia polysora. Pathogens can be identified by urediniosporanya, which is elliptical, there is also a round withno makrokopis symptoms on the leaves are brown reddish yellow.

40|$|Seven {{experiments}} were conducted at seven contrasting environments in Guatemala {{to determine the}} relative performance of seven testers in ranking a set of 21 lines of corn (Zea mays L.) of different origin and different levels of inbreeding. A randomized complete block design with a split-plot arrangement and two replications {{was used to evaluate}} the 147 testcrosses (21 lines x seven testers), the seven testers per se, and a set of seven hybrid checks. The 21 lines were assigned to the whole plots while the seven testers were assigned to the sub plots. The seven testers per se (five single-crosses, one synthetic, and one S[subscript] 3 inbred) and the seven checks were assigned to two whole plots, but they were analyzed separately from the 147 testcrosses;The combined analysis of the 147 testcrosses for yield (t/ha) showed highly significant differences (P ≤ 0. 01) for the sources of variation of environments, lines, testers, and the interactions of lines and testers with environments. Estimates of coefficient of concordance (W) and Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were highly significant for the ranking of the 21 lines by the seven testers. Significant differences among testers occurred for days to silk, plant and ear height, and husk score. Three testers (No. 4, 5, and 6) had positive estimates of general combining ability (GCA) across the 21 lines and eight lines had positive estimates of general combining ability across the seven testers;The best 10 testcrosses across the seven environments had significantly greater yield than the best check ICTA HB- 85 (0. 829 t/ha or greater). Line No. 13 and tester No. 5 were involved in five of the best 10 testcrosses. Tester No. 4 seems to include acceptable features to be considered as the convenient tester for the hybrid program under consideration in Guatemala. Three-way testcrosses significantly better than the best check ICTA HB- 85 were identified and should be extensively evaluated as potential new hybrids for release in Guatemala. Selection pressure should be emphasized to screen lines for southern <b>corn</b> <b>rust</b> (Puccinia polysora Underw) and northern corn leaf blight (Exserohilium turcicum Pass. = Helminthosporium turcicum Pass.) because of the highly significant correlation found in this study between these two diseases and yield...|$|E

Epidemics of this disease can cause serious losses in yield and quality of sweet <b>corn.</b> High <b>rust</b> {{susceptibility}} of many popular sweet corn hybrids is a major factor contributing to rust epidemics. Another factor is that sweet corn is usually planted over an extended period from May through June for fresh and processing uses.

40|$|The 2015 corn crop was {{impacted}} by several corn diseases {{from the beginning}} {{to the end of the}} season and in all areas of Nebraska. The increased severity and incidence of some diseases was largely due to the extended periods of favorable weather conditions in varying parts of the state that supported the increase in some diseases. In particular, frequent rainfall and high relative humidity were especially favorable for several fungal diseases. Unfortunately, almost all diseases of <b>corn</b> (except <b>rusts)</b> are caused by pathogens that can successfully overwinter in Nebraska. For this reason, making detailed notes on disease development and history for every field will help you both anticipate which diseases will be problematic in the future and better manage them.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of Austerity in America {{concerns}} how the country 2 ̆ 7 s geographical belts contribute {{to the culture of}} austerity in US capitalism in the time since Reaganism. In this dissertation I examine the <b>Corn</b> Belt, the <b>Rust</b> Belt, the Bible Belt, the Sun Belt and the Marijuana Belt as stages in the development of America’s culture of austerity. Since the early 1980 s America’s culture of austerity has protected the wealthy elite from the working classes, who have been punished by the offshoring of US manufacturing jobs in post-Fordist corporate restructuring. The overall goal of this research is to address how the culture of austerity, the demand that Americans do more for less, protects the concentration of wealth in US capitalism from the popular demand for better paying jobs and social security. The global hegemony of US corporations produces economic opulence for the top one percent and economic deprivation for the masses, who enjoy little to no social security. The solid economic security of industrial jobs and company pensions for the working classes has been melted into thin air by capitalist exchange. In the culture of austerity, the political regime of tax cuts for the wealthy ensures an austere diet of low wages, no company pensions and pathetic social security for the working masses, who work longer and longer hours for less and less. US capitalism produces unparalleled economic wealth, yet Americans have little economic security...|$|R
