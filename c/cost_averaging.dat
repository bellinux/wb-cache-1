50|$|Value {{averaging}}, {{also known}} as dollar value averaging (DVA), is a technique of adding to an investment portfolio {{with the objective of}} providing a greater return than similar methods such as dollar <b>cost</b> <b>averaging</b> and random investment. It was developed by former Harvard University professor Michael E. Edleson. Value averaging is a formula-based investment technique where a mathematical formula is used to guide the investment of money into a portfolio over time. With the method, investors contribute to their portfolios {{in such a way that}} the portfolio balance increases by a set amount, regardless of market fluctuations. As a result, in periods of market declines, the investor contributes more, while in periods of market climbs, the investor contributes less. In contrast to dollar <b>cost</b> <b>averaging</b> which mandates that a fixed amount of money be invested at each period, the value averaging investor may actually be required to withdraw from the portfolio in some periods.|$|E

50|$|Michael E. Edleson and Paul S. Marshall {{argue that}} Value Averaging can provide for an {{increased}} {{rate of return}} when compared to dollar <b>cost</b> <b>averaging</b> and other investment techniques. Professor Edleson recommends a VA period of three years. He suggests an infusion or withdrawal of capital every three or six months. For example, {{if one were to}} win or be bequeathed one million dollars, roughly 8.33 percent, with the exact amount being set by the formula, could be invested every quarter. It {{is important to note that}} the quarterly or semiannual amount can vary greatly, even resulting in a withdrawal, as mentioned above. Opponents argue that this misses the opportunity of already being fully invested when a large market upswing occurs. This argument against value averaging and dollar <b>cost</b> <b>averaging</b> and in favor of lump sum investing ignores the suggestion of Ben Stein and Phil DeMuth that it is more important to avoid a large market downswing, which is theoretically equally possible, since market movements are essentially unpredictable. Participating early on in a large market downswing has been shown to be devastating to the success of long term retirement, for example.|$|E
50|$|Value {{averaging}} incorporates {{one crucial}} {{piece of information}} that is missing in dollar <b>cost</b> <b>averaging</b> - the expected rate of return of your investment.

After the investment has over-performed, the investor {{will be required to}} buy less or sell. After the investment has under-performed, the investor will be required to buy more. Some research suggests that the method results in higher returns at a similar risk, especially for high market variability and long time horizons. Some research suggests otherwise.|$|E

5000|$|Dollar <b>cost</b> <b>averaging</b> {{is a form}} {{of product}} churn under certain conditions. In this strategy, an {{investor}} is advised to repeatedly buy or sell small lots of a security as the price changes. Each transaction carries a commission fee. In this way the overall cost is averaged down as prices fall, and the investor is protected from market fluctuations which can be very difficult to accurately predict. The effectiveness of this as an investing strategy is open to debate, but it involves many transactions, creating brokerage commissions for the brokerage firm. Frequent trading in fee-based accounts is not an example of churning, since no commissions are generated in those transactions. However, the practice of putting clients who trade infrequently into a fee-based brokerage account is known as [...] "reverse churning", since clients are charged fees in accounts with few if any transactions.|$|E

For example, Turbine wanted DDO to use a real-time combat engine, whereas tabletop D&D uses a turn-based system. This meant considerable changes in the handling of combat and character skills; differences include increased hit possibilities in a round, increased spell casting resources over rest periods, and the use of a spell point system instead of spell slots. Other differences, not mandated by the differences by real-time versus turn-based systems include: magical items are at a lower <b>cost</b> (<b>averaging</b> 1/8 of the tabletop D&D prices), characters have higher stats, and offensive effects created by characters do not harm their allies.|$|E
50|$|Dollar <b>cost</b> <b>averaging</b> is not {{the same}} thing as continuous, {{automatic}} investing. This confusion of terms is perpetuated by some articles (AARP, Motley Fool) and specifically noted by others (Vanguard). The argued weakness of DCA arises in the context of having the option to invest a lump sum, but choosing to use DCA instead. If the market is expected to trend upwards over time, DCA can conversely be expected to face a statistical headwind: the investor is choosing to invest at a future time rather than today, even though future prices are expected to be higher. But most individual investors, especially in the context of retirement investing, never face a choice between lump sum investing and DCA investing with a significant amount of money. The disservice arises when these investors take the criticisms of DCA to mean that timing the market is better than continuously and automatically investing a portion of their income as they earn it. For example, stopping one's retirement investment contributions during a declining market on account of the argued weaknesses of DCA would indicate a misunderstanding of those arguments.|$|E

All classes of securities exhibit economies of scale, although they are less pronounced for straight debt issues. IPOs also incur a substantial indirect cost due to short-run underpricing. Most large equity offers include an international tranche, although debt issues do not. I. introduction In this article we present the <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> of raising external capital for US. corporations from 1990 to 1994. Specifically, we report the average spreads on public equity offerings and debt offerings, {{along with the other}} direct costs of raising capital, {{as a percentage of the}} proceeds. We find substantial economies of scale for initial public offerings (IPOs) of equity and seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). We also find substantial economies of scale for both straight bond offerings and convertible bond offerings. Spreads on bond offerings are highly sensitive to the credit rating of the offering. This article is descriptive in nature; no theories are tested. Its purpose is to provide benchmark numbers for use by issuers of securities. We do not address why firms issue the securities they do.
