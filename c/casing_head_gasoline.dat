40|$|Gas lift {{is used in}} {{oil wells}} to {{maintain}} the production by injecting gas into the tubing. The dynamics of the system often causes pressure variations and a fluctuating flow rate. Others have proposed design concepts for stable gas lift systems. However, measurements have been superficial and sparse and it has {{made it difficult to}} enable satisfactory verification of the concepts. This thesis is based on flow rate, pressure and temperature data from a well at the Heidrun field in the Norwegian Sea. The measurements have been logged at a sufficient frequency to capture the most relevant dynamics. The well considered has periods where it produces evenly with a stochastic variation around 7 % and then it might suddenly change to oscillations with over 90 % deviation in the flow rate. The wavelength of the oscillations are 7 − 10 min. Such shifts seams to occur without preceding disturbances, and it only affects the tubing pressure and flow rate, not the annular variables. This means, that <b>casing</b> <b>heading</b> is not the reason behind the oscillating behaviour. A gas lift model has been implemented in Matlab to predict static changes in several variables, like phase fraction and pressure. Pressure predicted by this model compared to the measurement at Heidrun coincide with a maximum deviation of 2. 3 %. A dynamical model based on an inflow correlation to simulate the well pressure was developed. The predictions was not consistent with the oscillations observed from the measurements, because the inflow correlation did not compare with the measured data. The pressure response analysis did not show any sign of instabilities. However, an unstable well with oscillations was observed. The likely reason for the inconsistency is the <b>casing</b> <b>heading</b> assumption in the model. The large pressure drop across the downhole injection valve makes gas inflow insensitive to tubing variations, this decoupling prevents <b>casing</b> <b>heading...</b>|$|R

40|$|Gas lift is an {{artificial}} lift technique which {{is intended to}} be used in oil and gas production systems to enhance the oil recovery rate. The technique is used in production systems which suffers from insufficient production rates because of inadequate reservoir pressure. The principle is to inject extra gas, from an external source, into the fluid mixture flowing out of the reservoir. This reduces the weight of the fluid column, which in turn enables the reservoir pressure to lift the mixture of fluids up to the surface. Thus, the restriction in production rate, resulting from insufficient reservoir pressure, is resolved. The <b>casing</b> <b>heading</b> instability cycle is a phenomenon which may occur in such gas lift systems at certain pressure and flow conditions. In such a case, a blocking constraint leads to an accumulation of gas that is building up a high pressure in the container storing the extra gas. Eventually the pressure is able to overcome the blocking constraint which further leads to a production flow blow out at the surface. This process repeats itself {{over a period of several}} hours. The resulting flow regime may be damaging to the receiving surface equipment. It also leads to a decrease in the average production rate, which is highly undesirable. In this thesis a new low order mathematical model to describe the <b>casing</b> <b>heading</b> instability is presented. The model is further compared and fitted to a gas lift case implemented in the advanced OLGA flow simulator, which is regarded as the real flow process in this thesis. A controllability analysis is performed on the newly fitted model, and the results of the analysis are used to investigate which control structures that seems reasonable for stabilizing the <b>casing</b> <b>heading</b> instability. The most promising control strategies are further tested in simulations, both on the low order model and on the advanced flow simulator. The results from the analysis, which is further confirmed in simulations, show that out of the measurement candidates that were considered in this thesis, the bottom hole pressure, i. e., the pressure measured in the well or near the depth of the producing formation, is the single best measurement to use for both disturbance rejection and stabilization of the system. However, this measurement is known to be unreliable, if at all available, because of its location in a harsh environment. Another control structure which showed promising results both in analysis and simulations is therefore concluded as the better choice. This is a cascaded control structure, which only relies on realistically available top side pressure measurements. It proved successful in stabilizing the system. </p...|$|R

For all other cases, significant slippage can occur between lighter and heavier phases. Slippage will result in disproportionate amount of heavier phase being present at any given location in the well. This phenomenon is responsible for unsteady state in well string and also for loss of part of productivity of well both in gas and oil producers (Torre et al. 1987) which is known as <b>casing</b> <b>heading</b> and liquid loading in oil and gas wells, respectively.

Casing failure is becoming increasingly prominent in thermal recovery wells, which severely restricts the development effect of such reservoirs, improving casing life of thermal recovery well has become a urgent problem to be solved. Through on-site survey and analysis, reasons for casing damage were determined as follows: strength change by high temperature, sand flow over of oil formation, poor cementing, unfavorable heat insulation and bad material for casing. In order to improve casing life, the supporting measures are introduced, the measures include pre-stress cementing technology, using <b>casing</b> <b>head,</b> thermal stress compensator, high-performance insulation tubing, high temperature cement slurry system, FRT 110 H special casing, and early sand control completion technology.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} mainly {{investigates the}} occurrence {{and characteristics of}} density-wave instability in gas-lift wells. The investigation {{is based on a}} simplified gas-lift system, in which water and air are used as producing fluid and lifting gas respectively, and heat transfer effect is neglected. To carry out the investigation, both linear stability analysis and numerical simulation are performed. The linear stability analysis is based on a homogenous two-phase flow model and the numerical simulation is done by using a commercial available dynamic multiphase flow simulator. In this way, a crosscheck between the two methods can be made in order to gain confidence about the results. Both two methods are validated against <b>casing</b> <b>heading</b> problem before they are applied to density-wave instability study. The results show that it is possible for density-wave instability to occur in those gas-lift wells producing from depleted reservoirs. The linear stability analysis and numerical simulation give the similar parametric trend in characterizing the instability. Within the normal gas-lift operation parameter range, increasing reservoir pressure and gas injection rate increases stability, but increasing tubing diameter, productivity index and system pressure decreases stability. The instability may occur only when the well loses its capability of natural flowing. Dynamic simulation also shows that the average production rate could be significantly reduced due to the unstable gas-lift compared with the steadystate prediction. An attempt of using feedback control to stabilize the gas-lift system is also tested by using the simulator. Promising results are obtained from the test in both stabilization and increasing production. The results of this dissertation add new knowledge to gas-lift instability fundamentals and can help in diagnosing and remedying unstable gas-lift problems. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
