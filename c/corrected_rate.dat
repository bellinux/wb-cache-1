METHODS: Totally 46 patients(67 eyes) were randomly divided into 2 groups: 23 cases(33 eyes) in Group A were given conjoint fascial sheath(CFS) suspension surgery; 23 cases(34 eyes) in Group B Whitnall ligament suspension. Postoperative follow-up was 6 mo. <b>Corrected</b> <b>rate,</b> recurrence rate and postoperative adverse reactions were compared and analyzed. RESULTS:The corrected rates {{of the two groups}} were both satisfied without significant difference between the two groups(P > 0. 05). the Whitnall ligament suspension surgery had less recurrence than CFS suspension surgery, but the difference was not statistically significant(P > 0. 05). The rate of hypophasis after CFS suspension surgery was significantly less than that after Whitnall ligament suspension(P CONCLUSION: The two operations both have satisfied <b>corrected</b> <b>rate</b> and low recurrence rate, the Whitnall ligament suspension surgery is less damaging and more easy to operate, while CFS suspension surgery is repeatable and less rate of hypophasis...|$|E

Furthermore, as several authors have pointed out recently, linear molecular clocks that incorporate selectable characters are in any case problematic. We here confirm a modest effect of purifying selection on the mtDNA coding region and propose an improved molecular clock for dating human mtDNA, based on a worldwide phylogeny of > 2000 complete mtDNA genomes and calibrating against recent evidence for the divergence time of humans and chimpanzees. We focus on a time-dependent mutation rate based on the entire mtDNA genome and supported by a neutral clock based on synonymous mutations alone. We show that the <b>corrected</b> <b>rate</b> is further corroborated by archaeological dating for the settlement of the Canary Islands and Remote Oceania and also, given certain phylogeographic assumptions, by {{the timing of the}} first modern human settlement of Europe and resettlement after the Last Glacial Maximum. The <b>corrected</b> <b>rate</b> yields an age of modern human expansion in the Americas at ~ 15 kya that - unlike the uncorrected clock - matches the archaeological evidence, but continues to indicate an out-of-Africa dispersal at around 55 - 70 kya, 5 - 20 ky before any clear archaeological record, suggesting the need for archaeological research efforts focusing on this time window. We also present improved rates for the mtDNA control region, and the first comprehensive estimates of positional mutation rates for human mtDNA, which are essential for defining mutation models in phylogenetic analyses.

In the present study, we developed and tested a non-invasive visual diagnosis method to detect the infection of the nem-atode Philometra ovata, which is parasitising in the body cavity of the common minnow Phoxinus phoxinus. By observing the surface of minnow’s abdomen, we diagnosed infected minnows with irregular or vermiform-shaped uplifts {{as a consequence of the}} presence of P. ovata in the body cavity. We conducted the diagnosis in minnows with or without anaesthetisation, and our results showed the non-invasive method is highly reliable (<b>correct</b> <b>rate</b> of diagnoses> 95 %) in both anaesthetised and non-anaesthetised groups. The <b>correct</b> <b>rate</b> of diagnoses in truly uninfected fish (i. e. specificity) was nearly 100 % in both groups, while the <b>correct</b> <b>rate</b> of diagnoses in truly infected fish (i. e. sensitiv-ity) was 71 and 65 % in anaesthetised and non-anaesthetised fish, respectively. The <b>correct</b> <b>rate</b> in fish diagnosed as infected or uninfected (i. e. positive or negative predictive power) of non-invasive diagnosis was nearly 100 % among the anaesthetised fish, and over 95 % in non-anaesthetised group. The diagnosis also yielded prevalence of P. ovata infection similar to the real prevalence in anaesthetised fish. Diagnoses conducted by an inexperienced observer indicat-ed that the method is repeatable. Taken together, the present non-invasive method seems to be a promising new tool for non-invasive detection of P. ovata infections in minnows and probably can be applied for the detection of other body cavity dwelling metazoan parasites in various host taxa...|$|R

Does water merely induce hydrophobic forces, or does the discrete nature of water play a structural role in folding? Are the nonadditive aspects of water important in determining the folding mechanism? To help to address these questions, we have performed simulations of the folding of a model protein (BBA 5) in explicit solvent. Starting 10, 000 independent trajectories from a fully unfolded conformation, we have observed numerous folding events, making this work a comprehensive study of the kinetics of protein folding starting from the unfolded state and reaching the folded state and with an explicit solvation model and experimentally validated rates.

Over the past 15 years (1968 - 82) 13 children have died from accidental poisoning from this population, and two were murdered with drugs.

The patients were followed up for 1 d- 12 mo. Observation of postoperative eye, adjusted eye position {{and whether or not}} had a second operation were taken. Postoperative eye position was compared with preoperative eye position. RESULTS: After Clifford Terry suture combined with adjustable suture, 42 cases with 67 eyes reached the anteroposterior position on the first day, one eye reached overcorrection, two eyes undercorrection.
