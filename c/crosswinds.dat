5|$|At 8:24a.m. MDT, Reid's {{aircraft}} {{began its}} takeoff from Runway 30 to the northwest, in rain, strong gusty <b>crosswinds</b> and turbulence. According to witnesses, the plane lifted off and climbed slowly, with its nose high and its wings wobbling. It began a gradual right turn, and after reaching {{an altitude of}} a few hundred feet, the plane rolled out of its turn, then descended rapidly, crashing at a near-vertical angle into Kornegay Court, a street in a residential neighborhood. Dubroff, her father, and Reid were killed instantly by blunt force trauma sustained from impact forces. Reid, who was legally the pilot in command for all of Dubroff's flights, was allegedly manipulating the controls during this particular flight segment.|$|E
5|$|The 2015 race {{consisted}} of six stages. It started in Dukhan on 8 February 2015 and finished on 13 February in Doha, {{the capital city}} of Qatar. The Tour of Qatar puts unusual demands on riders: it has no significant climbs, but almost every stage is affected by strong <b>crosswinds.</b> These conditions make the race ideal preparation for the spring classics season, so many prominent classics riders were present. The flat stages, suitable for sprinters, and individual time trial meant that specialists in these disciplines also chose to ride in Qatar.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} masses, gravity pulls the rider {{and all the}} bike {{components}} toward the earth. At each tire contact patch there are ground reaction forces with both horizontal and vertical components. The vertical components mostly counteract the force of gravity, but also vary with braking and accelerating. For details, see the section on longitudinal stability below. The horizontal components, due to friction between the wheels and the ground, including rolling resistance, are in response to propulsive forces, braking forces, and turning forces. Aerodynamic forces due to the atmosphere are mostly {{in the form of}} drag, but can also be from <b>crosswinds.</b> At normal bicycling speeds on level ground, aerodynamic drag is the largest force resisting forward motion. At faster speed, aerodynamic drag becomes overwhelmingly the largest force resisting forward motion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crosswind</b> kite {{power has}} been put to various uses {{throughout}} history. And the variety of devices that produce <b>crosswind</b> kite power have a historical progression. A simple kite system sitting passively without <b>crosswind</b> kite power production is contrasted with kite systems that fly <b>crosswind</b> producing greater harvesting of energy from the wind's kinetic energy. For perspective, a timeline of <b>crosswind</b> kite power uses and device progress may aid in understanding <b>crosswind</b> kite power.|$|R
40|$|Five {{methods for}} {{estimating}} <b>crosswind</b> profiles used in fast-time wake vortex prediction models are compared in this study.

The most important <b>crosswind</b> parameters are {{the magnitude of the}} <b>crosswind</b> and the gradient in the <b>crosswind</b> shear. It is known that pulsed and continuous wave lidar measurements can provide good estimates of the wind profile in the vicinity of airports. In this study comparisons are made between estimates of the <b>crosswind</b> profiles from a priori information on the trajectory of the vortex pair as well as <b>crosswind</b> profiles derived from different sensors and a regional numerical weather prediction model...|$|R

5|$|Because the {{aviation}} industry is especially {{sensitive to the}} weather, accurate weather forecasting is essential. Fog or exceptionally low ceilings can prevent many aircraft from landing and taking off. Turbulence and icing are also significant in-flight hazards. Thunderstorms are a problem for all aircraft because of severe turbulence due to their updrafts and outflow boundaries, icing due to the heavy precipitation, as well as large hail, strong winds, and lightning, {{all of which can}} cause severe damage to an aircraft in flight. Volcanic ash is also a significant problem for aviation, as aircraft can lose engine power within ash clouds. On a day-to-day basis airliners are routed {{to take advantage of the}} jet stream tailwind to improve fuel efficiency. Aircrews are briefed prior to takeoff on the conditions to expect en route and at their destination. Additionally, airports often change which runway is being used to take advantage of a headwind. This reduces the distance required for takeoff, and eliminates potential <b>crosswinds.</b>|$|E

40|$|A flight {{research}} program was undertaken to investigate problems concerned with landing a STOL airplane in <b>crosswind</b> conditions. The program included {{a study of}} piloting techniques and <b>crosswind</b> limitations during visual STOL type landing operations. The {{results indicated that the}} <b>crosswind</b> was more limiting during the ground roll out than during the airborne phases. The pilots estimated that the <b>crosswind</b> limit for commercial STOL type operations with the test aircraft would be approximately 15 to 20 knots.

5000|$|<b>Crosswind</b> kite {{power is}} power {{derived from a}} class of {{airborne}} wind-energy conversion systems (AWECS, aka AWES) or <b>crosswind</b> kite power systems (CWKPS) characterized by a kite system that has energy-harvesting parts that fly transverse to {{the direction of the}} ambient wind, i.e., to <b>crosswind</b> mode; sometimes the entire wing set and tether set is flown in <b>crosswind</b> mode. These systems at many scales from toy to power-grid-feeding sizes may be used as high-altitude wind power (HAWP) devices or low-altitude wind power (LAWP) devices without having to use towers. Flexible wings or rigid wings may be used in the kite system. A tethered wing, flying in <b>crosswind</b> at many times wind speed, harvests wind power from an area that is many times exceeding the wing’s own area. <b>Crosswind</b> kite power systems have some advantages over conventional wind turbines: access to more powerful and stable wind resource, high capacity factor, capability for deployment on and offshore at comparable costs, and no need for a tower. Additionally, the wings of the CWKPS may vary in aerodynamic efficiency; the movement of <b>crosswinding</b> tethered wings is sometimes compared with the outer parts of conventional wind turbine blades. However, a conventional traverse-to-wind rotating blade set carried aloft in a kite-power system has the blade set cutting to <b>crosswind</b> and is a form of <b>crosswind</b> kite power. Miles L. Loyd furthered studies on <b>crosswind</b> kite power systems in his work [...] "Crosswind Kite Power" [...] in 1980. Some believe that <b>crosswind</b> kite power was introduced by P. Payne and C. McCutchen in their patent No. 3,987,987, filed in 1975, however, <b>crosswind</b> kite power was used far before such patent, e.g., in target kites for war-target practice where the <b>crosswinding</b> power permitted high speeds to give practice to gunners.|$|R
40|$|<b>Crosswind</b> {{conditions}} are a contributory factor in many general aviation landing incidents and accidents. In an online survey, {{it was observed}} that 98 % of respondents either failed to or could not accurately calculate the runway <b>crosswind</b> component from air traffic control (ATC) reports passed using the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standard phraseology; the majority of pilots also severely underestimated the <b>crosswind</b> strength. Furthermore, nearly 30 % of these respondents could not recall or inaccurately recalled the <b>crosswind</b> limit of their aircraft. In a 2 nd study using a series of approach and landing trials in a general aviation simulator, wind reports were passed to participants using either the standard ICAO format or in a modified format, where the runway <b>crosswind</b> component was explicitly stated. The results showed that for the group receiving wind reports in the standard format, the mental arithmetic associated with calculating the runway <b>crosswind</b> impaired flying performance. As with the online survey, these calculations were also performed poorly. These results suggest that ATC reports on the approach should be amended to specifically include the runway <b>crosswind</b> component and that all aircraft should have their <b>crosswind</b> limit clearly indicated in the cockpit...|$|R
25|$|Landing {{the runway}} 13 {{approach}} was already difficult with normal <b>crosswinds</b> since {{even if the}} wind direction was constant, it was changing relative to the aircraft during the 47° visual right turn. The landing would become even more challenging when <b>crosswinds</b> from the northeast were strong and gusty during typhoons. The mountain range northeast of the airport also makes wind vary greatly in both speed and direction. From a spectator's point of view, watching large aircraft banking at low altitudes and taking big crab angles during their final approaches was quite thrilling. Despite the difficulty, the runway 13 approach was nonetheless used {{most of the time}} due to the prevailing wind direction in Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|Drag {{will cause}} the ball to lose {{mechanical}} energy during its flight, and will reduce the range and {{the height of a}} ball, while <b>crosswinds</b> will deflect it from its original path. Both effects have {{to be taken into account}} by players in sports such as golf.|$|E
25|$|Normal {{landings}} {{are done}} by touching all three wheels {{down at the}} same time in a three-point landing.

40|$|Ride {{comfort of}} road {{vehicles}} {{running on the}} ground has been extensively investigated {{as one of the}} main criteria in the design of road vehicles. The information on the ride comfort of road vehicles running on a long span cable-supported bridge under <b>crosswind</b> is, however, very limited.

40|$|<b>Crosswind</b> is a {{significant}} concern for natural draft dry cooling towers. The concern is more serious for shorter towers. Therefore, the <b>crosswind</b> influence is {{a significant}} threat {{to the use of}} natural draft dry cooling towers in concentrating solar thermal power plants, which are generally built at sizes smaller than conventional fossil-fired plants and employ relatively shorter towers. While some numerical studies and small lab-scale test reports exist, very few full scale experimental studies have been reported for conventional cooling towers and none for relatively short cooling towers suitable for renewable thermal power plants. To address this gap, a 20 -m tall fully instrumented natural draft dry cooling tower was built by the University of Queensland. The tower was designed to serve a future 1 -MWe concentrating solar thermal plant on the same site. Its performance was tested under different ambient temperatures and <b>crosswind</b> speeds. The detailed experimental data of the <b>crosswind</b> condition, air temperature distribution inside and outside of the cooling tower and the cooling performance are presented. The experimental data demonstrate the substantial yet complex impact of the <b>crosswind</b> on cooling tower performance. Significant non-uniformities in air and hot water temperature distributions and strong air vortices inside the tower were observed in high <b>crosswind</b> speeds. Unlike tall cooling towers used in large conventional plants, the cooling tower performance does not monotonously decrease with the increase of the <b>crosswind</b> speed. In fact, after the tower performance drops to its lowest level at a wind speed around 5  m/s, the trend is reversed and further increases in the <b>crosswind</b> speed help the tower performance. Analysis shows that this reversal occurs because the tower heat transfer mechanism changes.
