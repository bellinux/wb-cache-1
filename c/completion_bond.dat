25|$|The {{new year}} began with no {{work at the}} {{convention}} center construction site. Mayor Celebrezze ordered city Law Director Ralph S. Locher to order Hunkin-Conkey to begin work in three days or be in default of its <b>completion</b> <b>bond.</b> These demands were communication on December 26 and 27, 1961. The construction company replied with a five-page letter outlining why it could not. William S. Hunsel, a consultant to Outcalt, Guenther & Van Buren, advised Hunkin-Conkey to dewater in sections, laying the foundation in sections. But the company refused, as this {{would be much more}} expensive. Implementing a new drainage system was the only solution, company officials said, and it would take four more months to finish the foundation. Hunkin-Conkey's reply was unacceptable to the city, so on January 11 Cleveland Properties Director Harold Lausche sent the bonding firm, Federal Insurance Co., noticed of failure to perform. Defending itself to the insurer, Hunkin-Conkey said its contract required all pumping to be complete before additional excavation could proceed. The company admitted that it had successfully tested a dragline excavator to remove watery soil at the site, but it would need written city approval to use the excavator for the remaining foundation work.|$|E

40|$|The {{role of the}} RAP 74 � 1 helix of {{transcription}} factor IIF (TFIIF) in stimulating elongation by human RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) was examined using millisecond-phase transient-state kinetics. RAP 74 deletion mutants RAP 74 (1 – 227), which includes an intact � 1 helix, and RAP 74 (1 – 158), in which the � 1 helix is deleted, were compared. Analysis of TFIIF RAP 74 -RAP 30 complexes carrying the RAP 74 (1 – 158) deletion reveals {{the role of the}} � 1 helix because this mutant has indistinguishable activity compared to TFIIF 74 (W 164 A), which carries a critical point mutation in � 1. We report adequate two-bond kinetic simulations for the reaction in the presence of TFIIF 74 (1 – 227) � TFIIS and TFIIF 74 (1 – 158) � TFIIS. TFIIF 74 (1 – 158) is defective because it fails to promote forward translocation. Deletion of the RAP 74 � 1 helix results in increased occupancy of the backtracking, cleavage, and restart pathways at a stall position, indicating reverse translocation of the elongation complex. During elongation, TFIIF 74 (1 – 158) fails to support detectable nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) -driven translocation from a stall position and is notably defective in supporting <b>bond</b> <b>completion</b> (NTP-driven translocation coupled to pyrophosphate release) during the processive transition between bonds.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} the heterodimerization and intracellular transport from the ER to the Golgi complex (GC) of two membrane glycoproteins of a bunyavirus (Uukuniemi virus) that matures by a budding {{process in the}} GC. The glycoproteins G 1 and G 2, which form the viral spikes, are cotranslationally cleaved in the ER from a 110, 000 -D precursor. Newly synthesized G 1 was transported to the GC and incorporated into virus particles about 30 - 45 min faster than newly synthesized G 2. Analysis of the kinetics of intrachain disulfide bond formation showed that G 1 acquired its mature form within 10 min, while <b>completion</b> of disulfide <b>bond</b> formation of G 2 required a considerably longer time (up to 60 min). During the maturation process, G 2 was transiently associated with the IgG heavy chain binding protein for a longer time than G 1. Protein disulfide isomerase also coprecipitated with antibodies against G 1 and G 2. In virus particles, G 1 and G 2 were present exclusively as heterodimers. Immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibodies showed that heterodimerization occurred rapidly, probably in the ER, between newly made G 1 and mature, dimerization competent G 2. Taken together, our results show that these two viral glycoproteins have different maturation kinetics in the ER. We conclude that the apparent different kinetics of ER to GC transport of G 1 and G 2 {{is due to the}} different rates by which these proteins fold and become competent to enter into heterodimeric complexes prior to exit from the ER...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{migration}} of health-care workers {{contributes to the}} shortage of health-care workers in many developing countries. This paper aims to describe the {{migration of}} medical specialists from Sri Lanka and to discuss the successes and failures of strategies to retain them. Methods: This paper presents data on all trainees who have left Sri Lanka for postgraduate training through the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine, University of Colombo, from April 1980 to June 2009. In addition, confidential {{interviews were conducted with}} 30 specialists who returned following foreign training within the last 5 years and 5 specialists who opted to migrate to foreign countries. Results: From a total of 1, 915 specialists who left Sri Lanka for training, 215 (11 %) have not returned or have left the country without completing the specified bond period. The majority (53 %) migrated to Australia. Of the specialists who left before <b>completion</b> of the <b>bond</b> period, 148 (68. 8 %) have settled or have started settling the bond. All participants identified foreign training as beneficial for their career. The top reasons for staying in Sri Lanka were: job security, income from private practice, proximity to family and a culturally appropriate environment. The top reasons for migration were: better quality of life, having to work in rural parts of Sri Lanka, career development and social security. Conclusions: This paper attempts to discuss the reasons for the low rates of emigration of specialists from Sri Lanka. Determining the reasons for retaining these specialists may be useful in designing health systems and postgraduate programs in developing countries with high rates of emigration of specialists...|$|R
