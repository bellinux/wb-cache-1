25|$|The {{manufacture}} of the chains involved several processes: The {{figure of eight}} links were punched from a sheet of steel and assembled three deep with the centre link overlapping the two outer, like a bicycle chain. The links were held together with rivets cut from steel wire and hooks punched from sheet metal were attached to either end. The entire chain was filed smooth, burnished and tempered in hot oil. Because the work was so fine, the chains were often thinner than a piece of cotton thread, a magnifying instrument was required. In addition it was common practice to place a glass globe filled with water {{in front of a}} candle and a mirror behind to increase the light. By 1793 Robert Cox had a monopoly on <b>chain</b> <b>production</b> in Britain, supplying watch, clock and chronometer makers throughout the country. Production flourished and in 1845 William Hart opened a similar factory in Bargates. It was built to an advanced design with particularly large windows on either side. 74' long but only 18' wide, it allowed the maximum amount of natural light to enter.|$|E

5000|$|The {{proteins}} are immunoglobulin light chains (paraproteins) and {{are produced}} by neoplastic plasma cells. They can be kappa (most of the time) or lambda. The light chains can be immunoglobulin fragments or single homogeneous immunoglobulins. They are found in urine {{as a result of}} decreased kidney filtration capabilities due to renal failure, sometimes induced by hypercalcemia from the calcium released as the bones are destroyed or from the light chains themselves. The light chains have historically been detected by heating a urine specimen (which causes the protein to precipitate) and now by electrophoresis of concentrated urine. [...] More recently, serum free light chain assays have been utilised in a number of published studies which have indicated superiority over the urine tests, particularly for patients producing low levels of monoclonal free light chains, as seen in nonsecretory multiple myeloma and AL amyloidosis.

40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} the different comparative advantages of two emerging economic giants, China and India, {{in relation to}} the different skill distribution patterns in each country. By utilizing industry export data on China and India from 1983 to 2000, we find that a country with a greater dispersion of skills (i. e., India, especially in the earlier years) has higher exports in industries with shorter <b>production</b> <b>chains,</b> whereas a country with a more equal dispersion of skills (i. e., China, especially in the later years) is found to have higher exports in industries with longer <b>production</b> <b>chains.</b> The causal relationship is fairly robust across different specifications.

5000|$|In economics, {{fragmentation}} means {{organization of}} production in which {{different stages of}} production are divided among different suppliers that are located in different countries. Now products traded between firms in different countries are components instead of final products. Final products may be sold to outside the region in which fragmentation happens (East Asian countries often sell their final products to Europe and the USA for example). Producers in less developed countries get positions of production chain that add less value to final product.

40|$|Firms use {{inventory}} and interruption insurance to manage disruption risk in their <b>production</b> <b>chains.</b> They also take preparedness actions {{to reduce the}} expected length of disruptions. We analytically explore these three measures in a two-stage <b>production</b> <b>chain.</b> We find that {{inventory and}} preparedness differ in their responses to insurance and to production-chain cost and risk characteristics. We prove that, for any fixed level of preparedness, insurance reduces both the total inventory and the downstream inventory but it can increase the upstream inventory. The total inventory, the upstream inventory, and the production-chain profit all increase (decrease) as cost (risk) shifts downstream in the <b>production</b> <b>chain.</b> Downstream inventory moves in the opposite direction. If the firm adopts the preparedness measure but not inventory, we prove that insurance has {{no impact on the}} relative levels of upstream/downstream preparedness. Relative preparedness is also unaffected by the distribution of processing cost in the <b>production</b> <b>chain.</b> However, when the firm can adopt both operational measures – inventory and preparedness – the relative preparedness is affected by insurance and by the distribution of processing cost across the <b>production</b> <b>chain.</b> We numerically observe that the <b>production</b> <b>chain</b> profit increases as cost shifts downstream and risk shifts upstream.

In order further to supplement ecological tourism, agricultural sightseeing gardens that provide leisure activities have also been constructed. Pollution-free products currently make up 40 percent of the market, and the per capita income of farmers has increased steadily, from 3,708 yuan in 1998 to 4,556 yuan in 2001.
