25|$|In its closed position, a {{swing bridge}} {{carrying}} a road or railway over a river or canal, for example, allows traffic to cross. When a water vessel needs {{to pass the}} bridge, road traffic is stopped (usually by traffic signals and barriers), and then motors rotate the bridge horizontally about its pivot point. The typical swing bridge will rotate approximately 90 degrees, or one-quarter turn; however, a bridge which intersects the navigation channel at an oblique angle may be built to rotate only 45 degrees, or one-eighth turn, in order to <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E

Pheasant had been lost when the provincial {{government}} chartered the steamboat to <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>channel</b> in the Skeena. [...] On November 21, 1906, the sternwheeler's engines had broken down, and the powerless vessel drifted upon some rocks in mid-stream. [...] Having reached shore, the Pheasants crew was picked up by Camosun.|$|E
2500|$|The Williams Canal across De Soto Peninsula {{had been}} {{abandoned}} by Adm. Farragut and Brig. Gen. Williams in July 1862, but it {{had the potential to}} offer a route downriver that bypassed Vicksburg's guns. In late January 1863, Sherman's men, at the urging of Grant—who was advised by the navy that President Lincoln liked the idea—resumed digging. Sherman derisively called the work [...] "Butler's Ditch" [...] (since it was Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler who had sent Williams upriver to do the work), which was barely 6 feet wide by 6 feet deep. Grant, undoubtedly influenced by Lincoln's continuous inquiries as to the status of the canal, ordered Sherman to expand the canal to 60 feet wide and 7 feet deep and the effort became known as Grant's Canal. It was not properly engineered based upon the hydrology of the Mississippi River, however, and a sudden rise in the river broke through the dam {{at the head of the}} canal and flooded the area. The canal began to fill up with back water and sediment. In a desperate effort to rescue the project, two huge steam-driven dipper dredges, Hercules and Sampson, attempted to <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>channel,</b> but the dredges were exposed to Confederate artillery fire from the bluffs at Vicksburg and driven away. By late March, work on the canal was abandoned. (Remnants of about 200 yards of Grant's Canal are maintained by the Vicksburg National Military Park in Louisiana).|$|E

60|$|This {{was just}} what Joel liked. Head-work before all other work for him, and he set about the duty authoritatively and with promptitude. After rating the negroes roundly for their stupidity, and laying it on Mike without much {{delicacy}} of thought or diction, over {{the shoulders of the}} two blacks, he mustered his forces, and began to <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>channel</b> with intelligence and readiness.|$|E
60|$|The day was fine, and the Montauk, bearing her canvas nobly, was, {{to use the}} steward's language, also {{staggering}} along, under {{everything that}} would draw, from her topgallant-sails down, with the wind near two points forward of the beam, or on an easy bowline. As there was but little sea, her rate was quite nine knots, though varying {{with the force of}} the wind. The cruiser had certainly followed them thus far, though doubts began to be entertained whether she was in chase, or merely bound like themselves to the westward; a course common to all vessels that wish to <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>Channel,</b> even when it is intended to go south, as the rocks and tides of the French coast are inconvenient neighbours in long nights.|$|E
60|$|These conversations, however, were mere {{episodes of}} the great {{business}} of the passage. Throughout the morning, the master was busy in rating his mates, giving sharp reprimands to the stewards and cooks, overhauling the log line, introducing the passengers, seeing to the stowage of the anchors, in getting down the signal-pole, throwing in touches of Vattel, and otherwise superintending duty, and dispensing opinions. All this time, the cat in the grass does not watch the bird that hops along the ground with keener vigilance than he kept {{his eye on the}} Foam. To an ordinary observer, the two ships presented the familiar spectacle of vessels sailing in the same direction, with a very equal rate of speed; and as the course was that necessary to <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>Channel,</b> most of the passengers, and, indeed, the greater part of the crew, began to think the cruiser, like themselves, was merely bound to the westward. Mr. Truck, on the contrary, judging by signs and movements that more naturally suggested themselves to one accustomed to direct the evolutions of a ship, and to reason on their objects, than to the mere subjects of his will, thought differently. To him, the motive of the smallest change on board the sloop-of-war was as intelligible {{as if it had been}} explained in words, and he even foresaw many that were about to take place. Before noon, the Foam had got fairly abeam, and Mr. Leach, pointing out the circumstance, observed, that if her wish was to overhaul them, she ought then to tack; it being a rule among seamen, that the pursuing vessel should turn to windward as often as she found herself nearest to her chase. But the experience of Captain Truck taught him better; the tide was setting into the Channel on the flood, and the wind enabled both ships to fake the current on their lee-bows, a power that forced them up to windward; whereas, by tacking, the Foam would receive the force of the stream on her weather broadside, or so nearly so, as to sweep her farther astern than her difference in speed could easily repair.|$|E

50|$|As the Allies pushed northward {{from the}} beachheads, the {{powerful}} guns {{of the fleet}} protected the flanks and knocked out the German coastal batteries on the Italian Riviera while minesweepers cleared the channel off the French coast. Incessant and her sister ships performed dangerous sweeping in the harbors of southern France in spite of human torpedoes and enemy shore fire from the Italian side. Incessant helped <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>channel</b> into Mentone 9-10 September and then continued her minesweeping mg and patrol duties at other Mediterranean points - Bizerte, the coast of Sardinia, and Palermo, Sicily. In January 1945 she was assigned new duties, and after transiting the historic Dardanelles, arrived Sevastapol 26 January. There Incessant met her Russian pilot and interpreter and began important air-sea rescue work in the Black Sea.

The Kurzsignale code system condensed messages into short codes consisting of short sequences for common terms such as [...] "convoy location" [...] so that additional descriptions would not be needed in the message with transmission as rapidly as possible, typically taking about 20 seconds. Typical length of a message was about 25 characters. The messages were preceded by the German Morse Code letter Alpha, encoded by [...].-.., to <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>channel</b> of less urgent messages and were called E-bar by Bletchley Park cryptanalysts and Alpha signals by the Kriegsmarine, indicating their importance.|$|E
