40|$|Abstract Background Sheepshead minnow (<b>Cyprinodon</b> <b>variegatus)</b> {{are small}} fish capable of {{withstanding}} exposure to very {{low levels of}} dissolved oxygen, as well as extreme temperatures and salinities. It is an important model in understanding the impacts and biological response to hypoxia and co-occurring compounding stressors such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, endocrine disrupting chemicals, metals and herbicides. Here, we initiated a project to sequence and analyze over 10, 000 ESTs generated from the Sheepshead minnow (<b>Cyprinodon</b> <b>variegatus)</b> {{as a resource for}} investigating stressor responses. Results We sequenced 10, 858 EST clones using a normalized cDNA library made from larval, embryonic and adult suppression subtractive hybridization-PCR (SSH) libraries. Post- sequencing processing led to 8, 099 high quality sequences. Clustering analysis of these ESTs indentified 4, 223 unique sequences containing 1, 053 contigs and 3, 170 singletons. BLASTX searches produced 1, 394 significant (E-value - 5) hits and further Gene Ontology (GO) analysis annotated 388 of these genes. All the EST sequences were deposited by Expressed Sequence Tags database (dbEST) in GenBank (GenBank: GE 329585 to GE 337683). Gene discovery and annotations are presented and discussed. This set of ESTs represents a significant proportion of the Sheepshead minnow (<b>Cyprinodon</b> <b>variegatus)</b> transcriptome, and provides a material basis for the development of microarrays useful for further gene expression studies in association with stressors such as hypoxia, cadmium, chromium and pyrene. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{sheepshead}} minnow, <b>Cyprinodon</b> <b>variegatus,</b> is {{a widely}} distributed small fish species that inhabits estuaries and inshore waters from New England to northern South America. This species has been used extensively in aquatic environmental toxicity and carcinogenicity tests (Couch et al., 1981; Courtney and Couch, 1984). Hepatic neoplasms have been induced in the sheepshead minnow by exposure to several known chemical carcinogens including diethylnitrosamine (Couch and Courtney, 1987), methylazoxymethanolacetate (Hawkins etal., 1985), and dimethylbenz(a) anthracene (Hawkins et al., 1991).

Binding of these chemicals to the ER can interfere with homeostasis by altering normal gene expression patterns. The {{purpose of this study}} was to characterize the expression of 30 genes using a sheepshead minnow (<b>Cyprinodon</b> <b>variegatus)</b> cDNA macroarray. Many of the genes on the array were previously identified by differential display reverse transcriptase– polymerase chain reaction to be upregulated or downregulated in sheepshead minnows treated through aqueous exposure to known or suspected estrogenic chemicals. The results of this study show that 17 β-estradiol (E 2), 17 α-ethinyl estradiol (EE 2), diethylstilbestrol (DES), and methoxychlor (MXC) have similar genetic signatures for the 30 genes examined. The genetic signature of fish treated with p-nonylphenol was identical in pattern to that in fish treated with E 2, EE 2, DES, and MXC except for the additional upregulation of a cDNA clone that shares similarity to ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9. Endosulfan produced results that resembled the gene expression patterns of untreated control fish with exception of the upregulation of estrogen receptor α and the downregulation of a cDNA clone that shares similarity to 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl–coenzyme A reductase.

As such, they {{also serve as}} senti-nel species in efforts to understand the magnitude and implications of anthropogenic habitat disturbance or deg-radation. An evaluation of the juvenile and adult marsh fish response to the Macondo oil spill in 2010 was con-ducted in 2012 and 2013 by sampling in both oiled and unoiled marshes in coastal Louisiana. To complement this analysis, we also examined marsh-fish assemblage struc-ture across several subhabitats (marsh edge, creeks, ponds, depressions).

Among the dominant species, abundance was often the highest in ponds and marsh surface depressions, with many fish species also commonly found in creeks, but few fish were collected along the marsh edge. Comparisons across representative oiled and unoiled sites from Caminada, Terrebonne, and Barataria Bays did not reflect any consistent differences in species composition, abundance, and size {{as a function of}} oiling 2 – 3 years after the oil spill reached Louisiana marshes.

40|$|The {{sheepshead}} minnow <b>Cyprinodon</b> <b>variegatus</b> {{has become a}} favoured model for laboratory studies because of their small size, rapid development, and tolerance of laboratory conditions. Here, we analyse {{sheepshead minnow}} post-embryonic development {{with the goal of}} providing a generally useful method for staging fish after embryogenesis. Groups of three females and two males were placed in breeding chambers designed for this experiment. More than 100 eggs were collected and maintained in seawater. Embryos were selected under a dissection microscope and placed in incubation dishes (50 per dish) at 26 °C. On day six, embryos hatched and larvae were transferred to 1 L beakers. To define a simplified normalization table for sheepshead minnow development, we measured each fish for its standard length and examined the fish for four externally evident traits: pigmentation pattern, caudal fin morphology, anal fin morphology, and dorsal fin morphology. The four traits were chosen, because they are easily visualized with standard laboratory equipment such as the stereomicroscope and camera. We have provided criteria for staging sheepshead minnows in studies of post-embryonic development. Our data suggest that dorsal and anal fin morphology may serve as a useful phenotype for defining metamorphic climax stages throughout post-embryonic development in C. variegatus.

To study this phenomenon further, sheepshead minnow (<b>Cyprinodon</b> <b>variegatus),</b> sailfin molly (Poecilia latipinna), and mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) were exposed to the exhaust plume in buckets placed near the launch site. An open bucket provided a full exposure, a partly closed one provided an intermediate exposure, and a closed one was the control. Three h after launch, the pH of the water from the full exposure had decreased from about 7 to about 3, Al and Fe levels had increased, and some fish had died. Gills of most fishes from full exposures and some from intermediate exposures were damaged. Gills, however, exhibited no aneurysms, mucus coagulation, or hemorrhaging. Some secondary lamellae swelled, some fused with adjacent lamellae, and others clubbed or retracted into the filament. Many lamellar pavement cells died and sloughed off. Mucous cells of intermediate exposure specimens bulged on the filament surface and pavement cells lost their microridges. Mineral deposits, probably aluminum oxide, occurred on gills of fishes from full exposures. Focally, pavement cells were eroded exposing the underlying structures. The sudden pH drop in the full exposures probably caused the gill damage. However, we could not determine the effect of previous exposure on the experimental fish, or whether gill damage was the lethal lesion.

The structural similarity between thyroid hormones and triclosan, an antimicrobial compound widely employed in consumer personal care products, suggests triclosan can have {{adverse effects on}} the thyroid system. The sheepshead minnow, <b>Cyprinodon</b> <b>variegatus,</b> is now used in ecotoxicological studies that have recently begun to focus on potential disruption of the thyroid axis by endocrine disrupting compounds. Here, we investigate the in vivo effects of exposure to triclosan (20, 50, and 100 μg L− 1) on the thyroid system and the embryonic and larval development of C. variegatus. Triclosan exposure did not affect hatching success, but delayed hatching time by 6 – 13 h compared to control embryos. Triclosan exposure affected the ontogenetic variations of whole body thyroid hormone concentrations during the larval phase. The T 3 peak around 12 – 15 dph, described to be indicative for the metamorphosis climax in C. variegatus, was absent in triclosan-exposed larvae. Triclosan exposure did not produce any deformity or allometric repatterning, but a delayed development of 18 – 32 h was observed. We conclude that the triclosan-induced disruption of the thyroid system delays in vivo the start of metamorphosis in our experimental model. We observed a global developmental delay of 24 – 45 h, equivalent to 4 – 7 % prolongation of the developmental time in C. variegatus. The costs of delayed metamorphosis can lead to reduction of juvenile fitness and could be a determining factor {{in the outcome of}} competitive interactions. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of ecotoxicological studies are performed under stable and optimal conditions, whereas {{in reality the}} complexity of the natural environment faces organisms with multiple stressors of different type and origin, which can activate pathways of response often difficult to interpret. In particular, aquatic organisms living in estuarine zones already impacted by metal contamination can be exposed to more severe salinity variations under a forecasted scenario of global change. In this context, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of copper exposure on the response of fish to osmotic stress by mimicking in laboratory conditions the salinity changes occurring in natural estuaries. We hypothesized that copper-exposed individuals are more sensitive to osmotic stresses, as copper affects their osmoregulatory system by acting on a number of osmotic effector proteins, among which the isoform two of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA 2) was identified as a novel factor linking the physiological responses to both copper and osmotic stress. To test this hypothesis, two in vivo studies were performed using the euryhaline fish sheepshead minnow (<b>Cyprinodon</b> <b>variegatus)</b> as test species and applying different rates of salinity transition as a controlled way of dosing osmotic stress. Measured endpoints included plasma ions concentrations and gene expression of CA 2 and the a 1 a-subunit of the enzyme Na+/K+ ATPase. Results showed that plasma ions concentrations changed after the salinity transition, but notably the magnitude of change was greater in the copper-exposed groups, suggesting a sensitizing effect of copper on the responses to osmoti...|$|E

Holothuroids had the thickest body-wall tissues and contained the lowest levels of mineralization in their body-walls. Crinoids and ophiuroids had high levels of mineralization in their arms. Asteroid body-wall tissues varied the most in thickness and ash content (0. 9 - 3. 9 mm in thickness and 29. 2 - 55. 5 % in ash content). Body-wall tissues of 19 species of echinoderms were tested for their feeding deterrent properties against the marine fishes Lagodon rhomboides (Linnaeus) and <b>Cyprinodon</b> <b>variegatus</b> (Lacepede), {{as well as the}} decapod crustacean Libinia emarginata (Leach). Equivalent sized pieces of fresh body-wall tissue of 16 species of echinoderms caused observable feeding deterrence responses in {{at least two of the}} three model predators. There was no significant correlation between body-wall thickness or percent ash and its palatability to any of the three model predators. Agar pellets containing ethanolic body-wall extracts of 12 of 18 echinoderm species caused observable feeding deterrence responses in the fish L. rhomboides. In similar experiments with the arrow crab Stenorhyncus seticornis (Herbst), using carrageenan fish-meal blocks as food models, no differences in consumption of control fish-meal and experimental body-wall extract blocks were detected.

Of particular interest {{is the possibility that}} the surface coat of such amplified surfaces may possess polyanions which could bind cations of the extracellular space and thereby play a role in electrolyte transport at the membrane. Previous light microscope cytochemical studies have provided evidence for the existence of polyanionic surface coats for several such specialized cells. In the present study ultrastructural cytochemistry was undertaken to more clearly define the nature of the surface coat of a cell type specialized for {{high levels of}} electrolyte transport. Morphological and cytochemical studies were completed on the chloride cell of <b>Cyprinodon</b> <b>variegatus</b> branchial epithelium. Gills from salt water—adapted specimens were processed with three different techniques useful for the ultrastructural localization of polyanions: ruthenium red; colloidal thorium dioxide at low pH; and colloidal iron at low pH. Morphological studies revealed that the fine structure of the chloride cell of this species is identical to that of other teleost species adapted to salt water. Of particular interest is the form of the surface amplification in this cell type, i. e., the cell surface takes the form of an extensive tubular system which fills the cytoplasm. Ruthenium red demonstrated a thick surface coat on the plasmalemma forming the tubular system. Colloidal thorium dioxide micelles were found on the outer leaflet of the tubular system plasmalemma. Colloidal iron micelles stained both leaflets of the tubular system plasmalemma, suggesting the presence of acid groups in the membrane itself.

The study we carried out aims to evaluate the effects of TCS exposure on development of <b>Cyprinodon</b> <b>variegatus,</b> a fish model used in ecotoxicological studies. We investigated the potential effects of TCS on C. variegatus during two key periods; embryonic development and metamorphosis. We exposed eggs and larvae to environmental relevant concentrations. We showed that TCS {{had no effect on}} reproduction parameters, such as egg fertility or survival rate of larvae. However, we highlighted the fact that hatching of exposed larvae was delayed of around 6 to 13 hours compared to control embryos. During the larval phase, measurements of THs levels were performed. We showed that TCS affected the typical ontogenic variations of the whole body thyroid hormones concentrations during metamorphosis. As THs are known to control somatic growth and development, we tested the effects of TCS exposure on morphological development. We observed no deformity or malformation, but we revealed a developmental retardation in larvae exposed to TCS, of around 18 to 32 hours. Such a developmental delay had never been highlighted in previous studies on TCS exposed fish. We hypothesize that the disruption of THs homeostasis affects the timing of the start of metamorphosis. As a consequence, exposed larvae showed an extended larval phase compared to the control group. The harmful effects of TCS on physiology and development are a major concern, as marine organisms are constantly exposed to it. Furthermore, strong connections exist between thyroid and reproductive system, which might have deleterious effects on population dynamics. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Invasive {{species have}} caused {{billions of dollars}} in damages to their {{introduced}} environment through direct effects on wildlife and by altering their introduced habitats. For a species to be considered invasive, it must successfully navigate the stages of invasion: it must be introduced, become established, spread, and have a quantifiable impact on its introduced environment. The numbers of introductions and individuals released affects the genetic diversity of nonnative populations which, in turn, can affect their invasion success. The Mayan Cichlid (Cichlasoma urophthalmus) is endemic to the Atlantic coast of Mexico and Central America. It was first detected in the United States in 1983 in Everglades National Park. Since then, it has spread across more than 70, 000 hectares throughout southern and central Florida. I have established the Mayan Cichlid to be a successful invader in Florida by quantifying per capita negative impacts of Mayan Cichlids on densities of Sheepshead Minnow (<b>Cyprinodon</b> <b>variegatus),</b> Marsh Killifish (Fundulus confluentus), and Eastern Mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) over a 15 -year period. I also analyzed the role of genetics in the invasion success of the Mayan Cichlid. I used a mitochondrial gene, cytochrome b, and 17 microsatellite loci to identify the sources for the Mayan Cichlid introduction into Florida. Cytochrome b data supported an introduction from Guatemala; microsatellite data suggested movement of Mayan Cichlids from the upper Yucatán Peninsula to Guatemala and introductions from Guatemala and Belize to Florida. I also found evidence of cytonuclear disequilibrium together with low genetic diversity within the Florida population which indicate a population bottleneck and admixture between two distinct lineages upon introduction, followed by rapid spread resulting in a panmictic population genetically distinct from the native range populations. I found much less genetic structure and a weaker correlation between genetic diversity and geographic distance within Florida compared with Mexico and Central America. Low number of effective alleles, heterozygosities, and FST values and the genetic similarity of Florida sites also indicate an admixed population or one that has rapidly expanded from a small initial group...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A 280 -d study {{examined}} the effects of 17 b-estradiol (E 2) on reproduction and development of the sheepshead minnow (<b>Cyprinodon</b> <b>variegatus)</b> exposed from the parental (F 0) through three subsequent (F 1, F 2, and F 3) generations and evaluated the need for multigenerational assessments of the risks of endocrine-disrupting chemicals. This first three-generation study exposed adult F 0 and F 1 fish to measured concentrations of 0. 01, 0. 04, 0. 08, 0. 2, and 0. 3 mg E 2 /L; the F 2 and F 3 generations were exposed to 0. 2 mg E 2 / L or less. The cumulative 21 -d production of normal embryos was significantly reduced in the F 0 generation at 0. 3 mg E 2 /L and in the F 1 and F 2 generations at 0. 08 mg E 2 /L or more. The daily reproductive rate was significantly reduced in all three generations at 0. 08 mg E 2 /L or more during spawning days 8 to 14 and 15 to 21. The proportion of infertile eggs from F 1 fish was significantly increased above that of the solvent controls at 0. 04 and 0. 2 mg E 2 /L and from F 2 fish at 0. 04 mg E 2 /L or more. Changes in liver, kidney, and gonadal tissues were seen in the F 0 and F 1 generations exposed to 0. 2 mg E 2 /L or more. The female gonadosomatic index was significantly decreased at 0. 3 mg E 2 /L in the F 0 and F 1 generations. Estradiol affected the hepatosomatic index only in female F 1 fish, but not in a dose-dependent manner. All F 1 fish in 0. 3 mg E 2 /L appeared to be phenotypically female. Our results indicate that lifecycle exposure to E 2 significantly decreased embryo production by F 1 and F 2 fish at concentrations lower than those affecting the F...|$|E
40|$|Current water {{management}} practices in South Florida have negatively impacted many species inhabiting Florida Bay. Variable and high salinity {{has been identified}} as a key stressor in these estuaries. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) includes water redistribution projects that will restore natural freshwater flows to northeastern Florida Bay. My studies focused on the following central theme and hypotheses: Biological performance measures (i. e., growth, reproduction, survival), behavior (i. e., habitat preference and locomotor behavior) and diversity of estuarine fish will be controlled by changes in salinity and water quality that will occur {{as a result of the}} restoration of freshwater flow to the bay. A series of acute and subchronic physiological toxicity studies were conducted to determine the effects of salinity changes on the life stages (embryo/larval, juvenile, adult) and fecundity of four native estuarine fish (<b>Cyprinodon</b> <b>variegatus,</b> Floridichthys carpio, Poecilia latipinna, and Gambusia holbrooki). Fish were exposed to a range of salinity concentrations (freshwater to hypersaline) based on salinity profiles in the study areas. Growth (length, weight) and survival were measured. Salinity trials included both rapid and gradual change events. Results show negative effects of acute, abrupt salinity changes on fish survival, development and reproductive success as a result of salinity stress. Other studies targeted reproduction and critical embryo-larval/neonate development as key areas for detecting long-term population effects of salinity change in Florida Bay. Adults of C. variegates and P. latipinna were also examined for behavioral responses to pulsed salinity changes. These responses include changes in swimming performance, locomotor behavior and zone preference. Finally, an ecological risk assessment was conducted for adverse salinity conditions in northeastern Florida Bay. Using the U. S. EPA 2 ̆ 7 s framework, the risk to estuarine fish species diversity was assessed against regional salinity profiles from a 17 -year database. Based on the risk assessment, target salinity profiles for these areas are recommended for managers. ...|$|E
40|$|Triclosan (5 -chloro- 2 -[2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy] phenol) is an {{antimicrobial}} {{widely used}} in various industrial products such as textiles, cosmetics and body care products. It is often detected in aquatic environments. The presence of the main biotransformation product, methyl TCS, indicates that this compound is not only degraded, but also persistent and accumulates in aquatic organisms. In this study, the effects of TCS on the thyroid system during embryonic and larval stages in <b>Cyprinodon</b> <b>variegatus</b> were evaluated. In particular, whole body thyroid hormone levels and the activity of deiodinases, enzymes involved in the activation of the thyroid prohormone T 4, were measured. Couples of three females and two males were placed in breeding chambers designed for this experiment from which 3832 eggs were obtained by reproduction in the laboratory. Eggs were collected and maintained in seawater. Embryos were selected under a dissection microscope, randomly assigned to each of five treatment groups: Control, DMSO control (vehicle), 20 μg/L TCS, 50 μg/L TCS and 100 μg/L TCS and placed in incubation dishes (50 per dish) at 25 °C. On day 6, embryos hatched and larvae were transferred to 1 L dishes. The larvae were fed on artemia and on flaked fish food till day 15 post hatching when the fish were analyzed. The fertilization and survival rate, {{as well as the}} larval dry weight did not vary significantly between individuals exposed to 20, 50 and 100 μg/L TCS. T 3 and T 4 concentrations increased significantly in larvae exposed to 50 and 100 μg/L TCS. The study of the activity of enzymes involved in the deiodination of thyroid hormones (ORD) represents a new aspect in the study of endocrine disruption in C. variegatus. Unfortunately, {{we were not able to}} detect a net enzymatic T 4 deiodination activity, most likely due to the very small amounts of protein and low specific enzyme activity in brain homogenates, carcass and liver.
