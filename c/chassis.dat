5|$|Bus <b>chassis</b> {{production}} {{began in}} 1950. VAT {{made the first}} prototypes of rear-engined buses in 1956. The company made two prototype <b>chassis,</b> which were designated model VAT-4800; the superstructures were made by coach builders Ajokki Oy and Nummela Oy. The solution caused several technical problems, including proper cooling and transfer of heating to {{the front end of}} the body. The cooling problem was finally solved by a large air scoop located at the back of the roof; this was not regarded as an aesthetically pleasing arrangement. As the solution was found, VAT produced ten more rear-engined <b>chassis</b> called type VAT-5200.|$|E
5|$|M16 – A T1E2 with a M45D Quad-mount and a M3 Half-track <b>chassis.</b>|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 2010 at the Indianapolis Museum of Art, Daniels {{was on hand}} to help {{announce}} the return of IndyCar Series <b>chassis</b> manufacturing {{to the state of}} Indiana. Dallara Automobili will build a new technology center in Speedway, Indiana and the state of Indiana will subsidize the sale of the first 28 IndyCar <b>chassis</b> with a $150,000 discount.|$|E
5|$|The <b>chassis</b> {{was derived}} from the T1E2 <b>chassis,</b> an earlier version of the M13. Based on an M3 Half-track <b>chassis,</b> it {{replaced}} the M13 MGMC half-track after early 1944. As aircraft became more advanced, the usefulness of the M16 was reduced. In the Korean War, it was relegated primarily to the ground-support role, being put out of service in the U.S. Army in 1951.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} model utilised the same Alcan bonded honeycomb aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT) as the concept {{car for the}} <b>chassis.</b> The <b>chassis</b> design featured two box section rails which acted as the suspension mounting points and would provide an energy absorbing structure {{in the event of}} a frontal impact, these were successfully tested at speeds up to , an integral roll cage formed part of the <b>chassis</b> and monocoque, providing additional structural rigidity for the car and allowing the XJ220 to easily pass stringent crash testing.|$|E
5|$|Three <b>chassis,</b> {{included}} the two modified BT48 units, were {{built for the}} end of the 1979 season. Two of these were re-used during the 1980 Formula One season, alongside seven new <b>chassis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Van or {{pickup truck}} – A typical {{ambulance}} {{is based on}} either the <b>chassis</b> of a van (vanbulance) or pickup truck. This <b>chassis</b> is then modified to the designs and specifications of the purchaser.|$|E
5|$|When it {{was decided}} to phase out the M24 Chaffee and other {{vehicles}} on the same <b>chassis,</b> the M19 turrets were re-mounted on a M41 Light Tank <b>chassis</b> to produce the M42 Duster.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of France, the U.S. Army studied the reasons behind the {{effectiveness}} of the German campaign against the French and British forces. One aspect that was highlighted by this study was the use of self propelled artillery; however, by 1941, there was little available in the U.S. Army's arsenal {{that could be used in}} such a role. The Army had a number of M1897A5 guns, sufficient for the mass-production for such a weapon, and the M3 half-track was coming into production. After some debate, the Army decided to place M1897A5 guns on the M3 half-track <b>chassis,</b> which was designated the T12 GMC. The M1897A5 gun was originally adapted for the M3 <b>chassis</b> by placing it in a welded box riveted to the <b>chassis</b> behind the driver's compartment. It was accepted by the Army on 31 October 1941.|$|E
5|$|Another {{variant of}} the Panzer IV was the Panzerbefehlswagen IV (Pz.Bef.Wg.IV) command tank. This {{conversion}} entailed the installation of additional radio sets, mounting racks, transformers, junction boxes, wiring, antennas and an auxiliary electrical generator. To {{make room for the}} new equipment, ammunition stowage was reduced from 87 to 72 rounds. The vehicle could coordinate with nearby armor, infantry or even aircraft. Seventeen Panzerbefehlswagen were built on Ausf. J <b>chassis</b> in August and September 1944, while another 88 were based on refurbished <b>chassis.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Wheldon had been working with IndyCar {{officials}} to develop the ICONIC <b>chassis</b> with the intention of improving safety in the sport. Planned changes to the <b>chassis</b> include larger cockpits for driver protection and bodywork over the rear wheels to prevent cars from launching off one another {{in the event of a}} collision, long a problem in open-wheel racing, regardless of oval or road course, but troublesome on high-speed ovals and tight street circuits with a long straight and a tight turn, similar to the style of many modern road courses.|$|E
5|$|By 2012, {{only a few}} {{manufacturers}} offered Itanium systems, including HP, Bull, NEC, Inspur and Huawei. In addition, Intel {{offered a}} <b>chassis</b> {{that could be used}} by system integrators to build Itanium systems.|$|E
5|$|Combining the {{strengths}} of the both companies was not successful in bus <b>chassis</b> production because of strategic mistakes by SAT. The Vanaja LK-series with a large, centrally mounted engine was discontinued, which led to the loss of the main customer, Väinö Paunu Oy. SAT offered Sisu <b>chassis</b> to replace the Vanaja models, but a number of bus operators, including TKL, rejected them.|$|E
5|$|FF Developments, in {{addition}} to their design work on the gearbox and rear axle assembly were given responsibility for their manufacture. The aluminium <b>chassis</b> components and body panels were manufactured and assembled at Abbey Panels factory in Coventry, before the body in white was delivered to the assembly plant at Bloxham. The car, including <b>chassis</b> and body components, consists of approximately 3000 unique parts.|$|E
5|$|For 1987, Forti {{moved up}} to International Formula 3000 with less {{immediate}} success than experienced in Formula Three. The main reason for this was the <b>chassis</b> the team chose to compete with. Instead of using customer Lolas, Marches or Ralts, {{all of which were}} produced by established companies who had many years' experience of designing and building such cars, Forti stuck with their Italian Formula Three <b>chassis</b> supplier Gian Paolo Dallara, who had just designed his company's first F3000 machine. Forti was the first team to use this machine, which was dubbed the Dallara 3087 (a <b>chassis</b> which later would make a single appearance in Formula One for the BMS Scuderia Italia team, as that team's car was not ready for the first race of the 1988 season). This combination of an inexperienced team and an untested car did not score any points in its first F3000 year, nor did the team attend every race on the schedule. Forti used 1988 to gain valuable experience in F3000, and this helped the team to perform better in following seasons, as did a change to more competitive Lola and then Reynard <b>chassis.</b>|$|E
5|$|In September 1958 VAT, {{together}} with other Finnish companies, participated in the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair. The vehicles shown were one Vanaja VAK lorry and a mid-engined VLK550 bus <b>chassis.</b> Due to the AEC engines the Vanaja's did not raise interest among the potential Greek customers, as relations between the UK and Greece were bad at the time. The lorry was finally sold in Greece but the bus <b>chassis</b> returned to Finland and was sold to a bus operator which built a tourist bus body on it.|$|E
5|$|Since the T65 {{project was}} fading away, the Armored Force still needed a light {{anti-aircraft}} vehicle, so {{they made a}} new project (called T65E1) based on the new T24 <b>chassis</b> (a prototype of the M24 Chaffee). The T65E1 had the same overall layout as the T65 GMC – gun turret at rear with the engines {{in the middle of}} the <b>chassis</b> – with a few minor tweaks (including an angular gun shield instead of a straight one).|$|E
5|$|T34 Calliope, rocket {{launcher}} mounted on M-4 Sherman tank <b>chassis.</b> Last vehicle-mounted highly-mobile multiple-{{rocket launcher}} by US land forces, before abandoning this concept till the latter's concept comeback in the mid-80's.|$|E
5|$|Temporary {{designation}} for Ausf F <b>chassis</b> {{built with}} long 7.5cm KwK40 L/43 main gun, later renamed into Auf. G and 8/BW.|$|E
5|$|The D 7p <b>chassis</b> for the Sd.Kfz. 250 light armored {{personnel}} carrier {{was based on}} that of the D 7 with a shortened suspension.|$|E
5|$|The M19 {{evolved from}} the 40mm Gun Motor Carriage T65 project, {{which was based on}} an Armored Force {{requirement}} for a light anti-aircraft vehicle based on the M5 light tank <b>chassis.</b> Although trials were successful and a production of 1,000 T65s had been requested, the project was stopped by the Ordnance Department since the M5A1 light tank <b>chassis</b> was being phased out of production.|$|E
5|$|The T-26 mod. 1939 with appliqué armour weighed , {{which caused}} an {{overload}} of the <b>chassis,</b> transmission, and {{engine of the}} light tank. Drivers were advised to use low gears only.|$|E
5|$|The car was {{initially}} designed in 1979 as a short notice {{replacement for the}} team's Alfa Romeo-engined BT48, after Brabham team owner Bernie Ecclestone decided to end {{his relationship with the}} Italian engine manufacturer. The BT49 was created in only six weeks using elements of the BT48 <b>chassis</b> together with the widely used Cosworth DFV engine. It is a single seater with an open cockpit and exposed wheels. The monocoque <b>chassis</b> is made from aluminium alloy and carbon fibre composites. The car was fitted with controversial hydropneumatic suspension and water-cooled brakes at different points in its life.|$|E
5|$|The <b>chassis</b> was {{manufactured}} from aluminium using Alcan's bonded aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT), {{and had a}} wheelbase of 2845mm. The {{design for}} the <b>chassis</b> featured rear wheel steering and packaged the fuel tank behind the centre bulkhead. Suspension design largely focused on road use, but a good compromise for racing use was achieved and the suspension height was adjustable. The concept car was fitted with a four-channel anti-lock braking system.|$|E
5|$|The company started {{producing}} bus <b>chassis</b> in 1950, and the superstructures {{were built}} {{by a number of}} Finnish coach builders. The last models were appreciated by a number of bus operators, and missed after production was stopped. All Vanaja bus <b>chassis</b> were fitted with air brakes by 1958, after the failure of hydraulic brakes on a Vanaja bus had led to one of the worst traffic accidents ever to have happened in Finland.|$|E
5|$|The full {{order was}} not {{completed}} as {{the requirements for}} anti-aircraft weapons had changed and <b>chassis</b> were diverted to produce more of the Chaffee light tank.|$|E
5|$|VAT {{fell into}} {{financial}} difficulties by {{end of the}} 1960s; {{this led to a}} merger with the other Finnish heavy vehicle producer Oy Suomen Autoteollisuus Ab at the end of 1968. The Vanaja brand ceased to exist in 1971, after which the former Vanaja factory produced Sisu terminal tractors, bus <b>chassis,</b> military vehicles and mobile crane <b>chassis.</b> The factory now belongs to Patriawhich produces Patria AMV armoured personnel carriersand heavy-vehicle axle producer Sisu Axles.|$|E
5|$|Vanajan Autotehdas {{was always}} a small company, {{employing}} about 400 people in 1968, and in the 1960s its market share was barely 5% in Finland. Almost all Vanajas were sold for the domestic market; only a few units were exported. Vanaja vehicles became known for their robust construction and high degree of customisation. The number of Vanaja bus <b>chassis</b> and lorries totalled 7,140 units; this consists of 260 lorry and 66 bus <b>chassis</b> models; for 116 lorry models {{only one or two}} units were produced. Vanajas had a good reputation and they are nowadays valued by vintage vehicle enthusiasts.|$|E
5|$|A United States Army Armored Force {{requirement}} for a mobile anti-aircraft gun {{to support the}} coming North African Campaign resulted in the T28 project being revived soon after its cancellation. The new vehicles used the larger M3 Halftrack <b>chassis</b> and an M2E1 sight for target spotting, receiving the designation T28E1 Combination Gun Motor Carriage (CGMC).|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 2,877 were {{produced}} by the White Motor Company {{during the period from}} May 1943 to March 1944, while 568 M13s and 109 T10 Half-tracks were also converted into M16s. Further production of the M13 and M14 was ceased in favor of production of the M16 and M17 (an M16 built on a M5 Half-track <b>chassis).</b>|$|E
5|$|All {{other teams}} had {{to apply to}} the ACO for an invitation. The ACO then decided on the {{remainder}} of the entry list based on each team's recent performances, as well as its originality in <b>chassis</b> and engine design.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{building}} was a crane for ironware handling. When the frames were taken in, they were fitted with suspension and axles, and then turned the right way up. The next parts were the engine and transmission components. The final part for lorries was a pre-assembled cabin. Conventional bus <b>chassis</b> were delivered with bonnet and wings, but the forward control types left the factory without any body parts. After being painted, the vehicles left the assembly hall. Finally, every vehicle was tested on a -long test run on different roads and with various loads. The bus <b>chassis</b> were tested in a similar way; because there was no body, the drivers only had warm clothes and driving goggles to protect them against the weather conditions. The vehicles were handed over to the customers after final adjustments.|$|E
5|$|Between 1934 and the mid-1940s, several {{variants}} of the Panzer I were designed, {{especially during the}} later years of its combat history. Because they were obsolescent from their introduction, incapable of defeating foreign armor, and outclassed by newer German tanks, the PanzerI <b>chassis</b> were increasingly adapted as tank destroyers and other variants. One of the best-known variants was the kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen ("small armoured command vehicle"), built on the Ausf. A and Ausf. B chassis—200 of these were manufactured. The Panzer I Ausf. B <b>chassis</b> was also used to build the German Army's first tracked tank destroyer, the Panzerjäger I. This vehicle was armed with a Czech 47-millimeter (1.85in) anti-tank gun.|$|E
5|$|In 1971 and 1981 {{the factory}} made tram bogies under licence from DÜWAG. The trams {{were made by}} Valmet {{for the city of}} Helsinki. Bus <b>chassis</b> {{production}} was officially discontinued in 1986, although in 1989 a small batch was made and later fitted with Ajokki coach bodies for delivery to a customer in the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In October 1940, {{development}} {{began to}} produce a vehicle {{in response to a}} long-standing requirement for an anti-aircraft vehicle to protect the U.S. Army's mechanized troop convoys from aerial attack. The first vehicle produced {{in the development of a}} half track with an anti-aircraft armament was the T1, which had two M2 machine guns on a Bendix machine gun mountas used on jeepson a 4×4 truck. The T1E1 had a power-operated Bendix mount, and the T1E2 a Maxson mount. The T1E3 had an electro-dynamic Glenn L. Martin Company aircraft-type turret. Evaluation of these test vehicles led to the T1E2 design being preferred. The T1E2 became the M16 Half-track by replacing the M33 with the M45 mount and the M2 Half-track <b>chassis</b> with the M3 Half-track <b>chassis.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the US, {{there are}} four types of ambulances. There are Type I, Type II, Type III and Type IV. Type I is based upon a heavy truck <b>chassis</b> and is used {{primarily}} for Advanced Life Support and rescue work. Type II is a van based ambulance with little modifications except for a raised roof. Its use is for basic life support and transfer of patients. The Type III is a van <b>chassis</b> but with a custom made rear compartment and has the same use as Type I ambulances. Type IV's are nomenclature for smaller ad hoc patient transfer using smaller utility vehicles where passenger vehicles and trucks would have difficulty in traversing, such as large industrial complexes, commercial venues, and special events with large crowds. These do not, generally, fall under Federal Regulations.|$|E
