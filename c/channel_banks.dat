The significance of <b>channel</b> <b>bank</b> erosion to the sediment budget is difficult to quantify without extensive fieldwork/data analysis. In this study, the importance of key physical factors controlling <b>channel</b> <b>bank</b> erosion, including <b>channel</b> slope, upstream catchment area, channel confinement, and sinuosity were explored using regression analysis. The resulting analysis {{can be used in}} practical studies to provide a first approximation of bank erosion rates (in catchments similar to those investigated). A dataset of <b>channel</b> <b>bank</b> erosion rates covering eight contrasting river catchments across England and Wales, over a time period of up to 150 years was created using a modified GIS methodology. The best predictors were found to upstream area, channel confinement and sinuosity with respect to dimensionless width averaged retreat rates (m m- 1 yr- 1). Notwithstanding these relationships, the results highlight the variability of the magnitude of sediment production by <b>channel</b> <b>bank</b> erosion both within and between catchments...|$|R

5000|$|Starting in 1911, {{telephone}} networks used {{frequency-division multiplexing}} to carry several voice channels {{on a single}} physical circuit, beginning with the first Type C carrier in that year, which heterodyned three voice channels stacked {{on top of one}} voice circuit. [...] L-carrier systems were loaded by multiplexing and supermultiplexing single sideband channels, using the long-standard 12 channel voice [...] "group" [...] produced by Type A <b>channel</b> <b>banks,</b> occupying a frequency spectrum between 60 and 108 kHz. This basic [...] "group" [...] was the entire line spectrum on previous long haul carrier systems, such as Types J and K.

50|$|An {{oscillating}} jump can occur when 2.5 < Fr1 < 4.5. During this jump, the {{jet of water}} {{at the entrance of}} the jump (supercritical) fluctuates {{from the bottom of the}} channel to the top of the channel at an irregular period. Turbulence created from this jet can be near the channel bottom at one instant and then suddenly transition to the water surface. This oscillation of the jet causes irregular waves to form, which can propagate for long distances downstream of the jump, potentially causing damage and degradation of the <b>channel</b> <b>banks.</b>|$|E
50|$|Riparian {{habitats}} {{are especially}} dynamic in alluvial river ecosystems {{due to the}} constantly changing fluvial environment. Alternate bar scour, channel migration, floodplain inundation, and channel avulsion create variable habitat conditions that riparian vegetation must adapt to. Seedling establishment and forest stand development depend on favorable substrate, {{which in turn is}} dependent on how sediment is sorted along the <b>channel</b> <b>banks.</b> In general, young riparian vegetation and pioneer species will establish in areas that are subjected to active channel processes such as at point bars, where coarser sediments such as gravels and cobbles are present but are seasonally mobilized. Mature riparian vegetation can establish farther upslope where finer sediments such as sands and silts dominate and disturbance from active river processes are less frequent.|$|E

As a result, {{it is important to}} set the flume so that it does not experience submerged flow conditions. Although commonly thought of as occurring at higher flow rates, It should be noted that submerged flow can exist at any flow level as it is a function of downstream conditions.

50|$|Flooding is {{a natural}} part of a river's cycle. The {{majority}} of the erosion of river channels and the erosion and deposition on the associated floodplains occur during the flood stage. In many developed areas, human activity has changed the form of river channels, altering magnitudes and frequencies of flooding. Some examples of this are the building of levees, the straightening of channels, and the draining of natural wetlands. In many cases human activities in rivers and floodplains have dramatically increased the risk of flooding. Straightening rivers allows water to flow more rapidly downstream, increasing the risk of flooding places further downstream. Building on flood plains removes flood storage, which again exacerbates downstream flooding. The building of levees only protects the area behind the levees and not those further downstream. Levees and flood-banks can also increase flooding upstream because of the back-water pressure as the river flow is impeded by the narrow <b>channel</b> <b>banks.</b>|$|E
50|$|Submerged Flow - {{when the}} water surface {{downstream}} of the flume is high enough to restrict flow through a flume, the flume is deemed to be submerged. Lacking the extended throat and discharge sections of the Parshall flume, the Montana flume has little resistance {{to the effects of}} submergence and as such it should be avoided. Where submerged flow is or may become present, there are several methods of correcting the situation: the flume may be raised above the channel floor, the downstream channel may be modified, or a different flume type may be used (typically a Parshall flume). Although commonly thought of as occurring at higher flow rates, It should be noted that submerged flow can exist at any flow level as it is a function of downstream conditions. In natural stream applications, submerged flow is frequently the result of vegetative growth on the downstream <b>channel</b> <b>banks,</b> sedimentation, or subsidence of the flume.|$|E
5000|$|For {{two weeks}} water flowed through the {{spillway}} {{to a maximum}} depth of 6 ft. The continuous rush of water removed tons of soil, numerous trees, and {{a portion of the}} 244 Spur Highway. Pooling waters from the spillway flow also threatened to damage U.S. Highway 77. To protect the U.S. highway, a culvert was intentionally breached on State Highway 57 to allow the pooling floodwaters to drain back into the Republican River channel. Throughout the entire flood, the dam performed as designed and held floodwaters back, lessening the downstream flood damage. During the highest release of water through the dam, [...] which lasted for approximately 10 hours, the riverbank channel immediately below the dam suffered some erosion damage. In the winter of 1996/7, repairs were made to the damaged channel below the dam. To prevent future damage during extremely high releases, the river channel was dropped 12 ft in elevation by excavation. The removed rock was used to create a berm across the south bank washout. The <b>channel</b> <b>banks</b> were re-graded, re-rocked, and re-grouted.|$|E
