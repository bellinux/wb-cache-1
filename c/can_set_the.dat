5|$|Sam & Max Hit the Road is a 2D {{adventure}} {{game where}} the player controls {{the actions of}} Sam from a third-person perspective. The player uses Sam to explore the pre-rendered cartoon environments {{of the game and}} solve a series of puzzles using a simple point-and-click interface. The game's puzzles have logical solutions, although a number of them have far-fetched solutions due to the game's cartoon setting. Players <b>can</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> game's cursor in a particular mode to designate how Sam interacts with the environment: Sam can walk around an area, talk to other characters, look at objects, pick them up or otherwise try to use them. The cursor's graphic changes when it is hovered over an in-game entity that Sam can interact with. When talking to another character, the player is given a choice of subject areas to discuss, depicted in a conversation tree as icons {{at the base of the}} screen. In addition to specific topics involving the game's plot, Sam can inject unconnected exclamations, questions and non sequiturs into a conversation.|$|E

25|$|During the 2012 Republican {{primaries}} the Republican Party of Iowa {{partnered with}} various news {{organizations such as}} Fox News to bring a series of debates that were nationally televised, but directed toward voters in Iowa. This national attention is a potential political boon for a small Midwestern state and attracts attention politically to a state that may otherwise not receive such attention. The caucuses also give power to the party members in the electorate. In this the average GOP voter in Iowa <b>can</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> tone for the entire primary campaign, which gives local voters tremendous control over who the next president will be.|$|E

The hero Peter Barlow {{comes to}} the village to confront a resident, James Gurney Hansford, who has cheated his father and driven him to suicide. They fight. Later Hansford is murdered and Barlow wrongly convicted of the crime.|$|R
25|$|Several charges {{described}} as taxes are not, in the literal sense, actual taxes, but withholdings from certain payments made. In each case, the payer withholds the relevant percentage and pays it to Revenue. The recipient is still liable for {{tax on the}} full amount, but <b>can</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> withholding against his overall tax liability. If the amount withheld {{is less than the}} tax payable, the recipient is still liable for the difference, and if the amount withheld exceeds the tax payable, the recipient can set it off against other tax due, or obtain a refund. This contrasts with DIRT, which, while a withholding tax, discharges the entire tax liability of the recipient.|$|E
25|$|There are {{currently}} three CGMS (continuous glucose monitoring system) available. The first is Medtronic's Minimed Paradigm RTS with a sub-cutaneous probe {{attached to a}} small transmitter (roughly {{the size of a}} quarter) that sends interstitial glucose levels to a small pager sized receiver every five minutes. The Dexcom System is another system, available in two different generations in the US, the G4 and the G5. (1Q 2016). It is a hypodermic probe with a small transmitter. The receiver {{is about the size of}} a cell phone and can operate up to twenty feet from the transmitter. The Dexcom G4 transmits via radio frequency and requires a dedicated receiver. The G5 version utilizes Bluetooth low energy for data transmission, and can transmit data directly to a compatible cellular telephone. Currently, only Apple's iPhone can be used as a receiver, but Dexcom is in the process of getting an Android version approved, and anticipates availability in the second half of 2016. Aside from a two-hour calibration period, monitoring is logged at five-minute intervals for up to 1 week. The user <b>can</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> high and low glucose alarms. The third CGMS available is the FreeStyle Navigator from Abbott Laboratories.|$|E

The game also features unlockable weapons and costumes.|$|E
500|$|I {{have almost}} reached the regrettable {{conclusion}} that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Councilor or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to [...] "order" [...] than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which {{is the absence of}} tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: [...] "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action"; who paternalistic-ally believes he <b>can</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a [...] "more convenient season." ...|$|E
500|$|Stott withdrew {{support in}} 1970 over the Chowilla Dam, {{a dispute over}} the {{location}} of a dam on the Murray River, and South Australia went to the polls. The dam controversy was not much of an election issue, and attempts by the Democratic Labor Party to portray Dunstan as a communist over his opposition to ongoing Australian support for South Vietnam had little effect. The LCL campaigned heavily on Hall, while Dunstan promised sweeping social reform, artistic transformation and more community services. He said [...] "We'll set a new standard of social advancement that the whole of Australia will envy. We believe South Australia <b>can</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> pace. It can happen here. We can do it." [...] Dunstan won the 1970 election easily, taking 27 seats compared with the LCL's 20. Although the share of the votes had been similar to 1968, the dilution of the Playmander had changed the share of the seats. As Labor had attained a majority of the popular vote for a long period, and because malapportionment had been largely ended, the political scientists Neal Blewett and Dean Jaensch said [...] "a Dunstan decade seems assured".|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} Dragon Quest game {{is often}} cited as the first console RPG. GameSpot called the original Dragon Quest one of the fifteen most influential games of all time and the [...] "most influential role-playing games of all time", stating that nearly all Japanese RPGs since then have drawn from its gameplay [...] "in some shape or form." [...] Next Generation said it was [...] "probably the first ever 'Japanese style' RPG", and listed the series collectively as number 56 on their [...] "Top 100 Games of All Time". They commented, [...] "While never as ambitious as Square's Final Fantasy series, later installments of Dragon Warrior can't be beaten for sheer size (if you only had enough cash to buy you one game that had to last you a month, you bought a Dragon Warrior title)." [...] In response to a survey, Gamasutra cites Quinton Klabon of Dartmouth College as stating Dragon Warrior translated the D experience to video games and set the genre standards. Games such as Mother, Breath of Fire and Lufia & the Fortress of Doom were inspired by various Dragon Quest titles. Dragon QuestIIIs class-changing system would shape other RPGs, especially the Final Fantasy series. Dragon Quest IVs [...] "Tactics" [...] system, where the player <b>can</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> AI routines for NPCs, {{is seen as a}} precursor to Final Fantasy XIIs [...] "Gambits" [...] system. Dragon Quest V is cited as having monster recruiting and training mechanics that inspired monster-collecting RPGs such as Pokรฉmon, Digimon, and Dokapon, and in turn the modern trend of collecting achievements. Dragon Quest V also introduced the concept of a playable pregnancy. The real world and dream world setting of Dragon Quest VI is considered an influence on the later Square RPGs Chrono Cross and Final FantasyX. The Dragon Quest series was recognized by Guinness World Records, with six world records in the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition. These records include [...] "Best Selling Role Playing Game on the Super Famicom", [...] "Fastest Selling Game in Japan", and [...] "First Video Game Series to Inspire a Ballet".|$|E

The cursor will move slowly on the screen, with good precision. When the movement of the mouse passes the value set for some threshold, the software will start to move the cursor faster, with a greater rate factor. Usually, the user <b>can</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> value of the second rate factor by changing the [...] "acceleration" [...] setting.|$|E
2500|$|As {{opposed to}} a vehicle riding along a flat circle, {{inclined}} edges add an additional force that keeps the vehicle in its path and prevents a car from being [...] "dragged into" [...] or [...] "pushed out of" [...] the circle (or a railroad wheel from moving sideways so as to nearly rub on the wheel flange). [...] This force is the horizontal component of the vehicle's normal force. In the absence of friction, the normal force {{is the only one}} acting on the vehicle {{in the direction of the}} center of the circle. Therefore, as per Newton's second law, we <b>can</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> horizontal component of the normal force equal to mass multiplied by centripetal acceleration: ...|$|E

2500|$|When a user makes a building, model, or {{any other}} kind of object in Revit, they may use Revit's {{rendering}} engine to make a more realistic image of what is otherwise a very diagrammatic model. This is accomplished by either using the premade model, wall, floor, etc., tools, or making her or his own models, walls, materials, etc. Revit 2010 comes with a plethora of predefined materials, each of which can be modified to the user's desires. The user can also begin with a [...] "Generic" [...] material. With this, the user <b>can</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> rotation, size, brightness, and intensity of textures, gloss maps (also known as shinemaps), transparency maps, reflection maps, oblique reflection maps, hole maps, and bump maps, as well as leaving the map part out and just using the sliders for any one (or all or none) of the aforementioned features of textures.|$|E
2500|$|A played note of E or F has a {{frequency}} {{which is often}} {{very close to the}} natural resonating frequency of the body of the instrument, [...] and if the problem is not addressed this <b>can</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> body into near resonance. [...] This may cause an unpleasant sudden amplification of this pitch, [...] and additionally a loud beating sound results from the interference produced between these nearby frequencies; this is known as the โwolf toneโ because it is an unpleasant growling sound. The wood resonance appears to be split into two frequencies by the driving force of the sounding string. These two periodic resonances beat with each other. This wolf tone must be eliminated or significantly reduced for the cello to play the nearby notes with a pleasant tone. This can be accomplished by modifying the cello front plate, attaching a wolf eliminator (a metal cylinder or a rubber cylinder encased in metal), or moving the sound post.|$|E
2500|$|Announcing {{products}} earlyโmonths {{or years}} before their release date, also called [...] "preannouncing", {{has been an}} effective way by some developers to make their products successful. It {{can be seen as}} a legitimate part of their marketing strategy, but is generally not popular with industry press. The first company to release a product in a given market often gains an advantage. It <b>can</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> standard for similar future products, attract a large number of customers, and establish its brand before competitor's products are released. Public relations firm Coakley-Heagerty used an early announcement in 1984 to build interest among potential customers. Its client was Nolan Bushnell, formerly of Atari Inc. who wanted to promote the new Sente Technologies, but his contract with Atari prohibited doing so until a later date. The firm created an advertising campaignโincluding brochures and a shopping-mall appearanceโaround a large ambiguous box covered in brown paper to increase curiosity until Sente could be announced.|$|E
