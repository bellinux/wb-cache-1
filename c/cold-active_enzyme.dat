40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{structural}} {{basis of}} adaptation of enzymes to low temperature is poorly understood. Dimeric citrate synthase {{has been used}} as a model enzyme to study the structural basis of thermostability, the structure of the enzyme from organisms living in habitats at 55 °C and 100 °C having previously been determined. Here the study is extended to include a citrate synthase from an Antarctic bacterium, allowing us to explore the structural basis of cold activity and thermostability across the whole temperature range over which life is known to exist. Results: We report here the first crystal structure of a <b>cold-active</b> <b>enzyme,</b> citrate synthase, isolated from an Antarctic bacterium, at a resolution of 2. 09 å. In comparison with the same enzyme from a hyperthermophilic host, the <b>cold-active</b> <b>enzyme</b> has a much more accessible active site, an unusual electrostatic potential distribution and an increased relative flexibility of the small domain compared to the large domain. Several other features of the <b>cold-active</b> <b>enzyme</b> were also identified: reduced subunit interface interactions with no intersubunit ion-pair networks; loops of increased length carrying more charge and fewer proline residues; an increase in solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues; and an increase in intramolecular ion pairs. Conclusions: Enzymes from organisms living at the temperature extremes of life need to avoid hot or cold denaturation yet maintain sufficient structural integrity to allow catalytic efficiency. For hyperthermophiles, thermal denaturation of the citrate synthase dimer appears to be resisted by complex networks of ion pairs at the dimer interface, a feature common to other hyperthermophilic proteins. For the cold-active citrate synthase, cold denaturation appears to be resisted by an increase in intramolecular ion pairs compared to the hyperthermophilic enzyme.

Further comparative experiments {{have shown that}} CelG is a <b>cold-active</b> <b>enzyme</b> whose catalytic properties are superior to those of several other intensively studied cold-active enzymes. It has a lower temperature optimum, of 25 °C, and retains about 70 % of its maximum activity at 0 °C, while EGD has a temperature optimum of 35 °C and retains only about 18 % of its maximal activity at 0 °C. When assayed at 4 °C, CelG exhibits a 33 -fold-higher k cat value and a 73 -fold-higher physiological efficiency (k cat/K m) than EGD. CelG has a low thermal stability, {{as indicated by the}} effect of temperature on its activity and secondary structure. The presence of small amino acids around the putative catalytic residues may add to the flexibility of the enzyme, thereby increasing its activity at cold temperatures. Its activity is modulated by sodium chloride, with an increase of over 1. 8 -fold at an ionic strength of 0. 03. Possible explanations for the presence of a <b>cold-active</b> <b>enzyme</b> in a mesophile are that cold-active enzymes are more broadly distributed than previously expected, that lateral transfer of the gene from a psychrophile occurred, or that F. succinogenes originated from the marine environment.

40|$|We are {{investigating}} glycosyl hydrolases from new psychrophilic isolates {{to examine the}} adaptations of enzymes to low temperatures. A β-galactosidase from isolate BA, which we have classified as a strain of the lactic acid bacterium Carnobacterium piscicola, was capable of hydrolyzing the chromogen 5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) at 4 °C and possessed higher activity in crude cell lysates at 25 than at 37 °C. Sequence analysis of a cloned DNA fragment encoding this activity revealed a gene cluster containing three glycosyl hydrolases with homology to an α-galactosidase and two β-galactosidases. The larger of the two β-galactosidase genes, bgaB, encoded the 76. 8 -kDa <b>cold-active</b> <b>enzyme.</b> This gene was homologous to family 42 glycosyl hydrolases, a group which contains several thermophilic enzymes but none from lactic acid bacteria.

Its optimal temperature for activity was 30 °C, and it was inactivated at 40 °C in 10 min.

40|$|A new microcalorimetric {{method for}} {{recording}} the kinetic parameters k(cat) /K-m and K-i of alpha-amylases using polysaccharides and oligosaccharides as substrates is described. This method {{is based on}} the heat released by glycosidic bond hydrolysis. The method has been developed to study the active site properties of the cold-active alpha-amylase produced by an Antarctic psychrophilic bacterium in comparison with its closest structural homolog from pig pancreas. It is shown that the psychrophilic a-amylase is more active on large macromolecular substrates and that the higher rate constants k(cat) are gained at the expense of a lower affinity for the substrate. The active site is able to accommodate larger inhibitory complexes, resulting in a mixed-type inhibition of starch hydrolysis by maltose. A method for recording the binding enthalpies by isothermal titration calorimetry in a low-affinity system has been developed, allowing analysis of the energetics of weak ligand binding using the allosteric activator chloride. It is shown that the low affinity of the psychrophilic a-amylase for chloride is entropically driven. The high enthalpic and entropic contributions of activator binding suggest large structural fluctuations between the free and the bound states of the <b>cold-active</b> <b>enzyme.</b> The kinetic and thermodynamic data for the psychrophilic a-amylase indicate that the strictly conserved side-chains involved in substrate binding and catalysis possess an improved mobility, responsible for activity in the cold, and resulting from the disappearance of stabilizing interactions far from the active site.

ROS damage a number of macromolecules, and in order to withstand such a harsh environment, the bacteria need to have well-functioning ROS scavenging and repair systems. Herein, MutT is an important nucleotide-pool sanitization enzyme, which degrades 8 -oxo-dGTP and thus prevents it from being incorporated into DNA. In this context, we have performed a comparative biochemical and structural analysis of MutT from the fish pathogen Aliivibrio salmonicida (AsMutT) and the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae (VcMutT), in order to analyse their function as nucleotide sanitization enzymes and also determine possible cold-adapted properties of AsMutT. The biochemical characterisation revealed that both enzymes possess activity towards the 8 -oxo-dGTP substrate, and that AsMutT has a higher catalytic efficiency than VcMutT at all temperatures studied. Calculations based on the biochemical data also revealed a lower activation energy (Ea) for AsMutT compared to VcMutT, and differential scanning calorimetry experiments showed that AsMutT displayed an unexpected higher melting temperature (Tm) value than VcMutT. A comparative analysis of the crystal structure of VcMutT, determined to 2. 42 Å resolution, and homology models of AsMutT indicate that three unique Gly residues in loops of VcMutT, and additional long range ion-pairs in AsMutT could explain the difference in temperature stability of the two enzymes. We conclude that AsMutT is a stable, <b>cold-active</b> <b>enzyme</b> with high catalytic efficiency and reduced Ea, compared to the mesophilic VcMutT...|$|E

Cold-loving organisms (psychrophiles) express heat-labile enzymes that possess a high specific activity and catalytic efficiency at low temperatures. A remarkable universal characteristic of cold-active enzymes is that they show a reduction both in activation enthalpy and entropy, compared to mesophilic orthologs, which makes their reaction rates less sensitive to falling temperature. Despite significant efforts since the early 1970 s, the important question {{of the origin of}} this effect still largely remains unanswered. Here we use cold- and warm-active trypsins as model systems to investigate the temperature dependence of the reaction rates with extensive molecular dynamics free energy simulations. The calculations quantitatively reproduce the catalytic rates of the two enzymes and further yield high-precision Arrhenius plots, which show the characteristic trends in activation enthalpy and entropy. Detailed structural analysis indicates that the relationship between these parameters and the 3 D structure is reflected by significantly different internal protein energy changes during the reaction. The origin of this effect is not localized to the active site, but is found in the outer regions of the protein, where the <b>cold-active</b> <b>enzyme</b> has a higher degree of softness.

Both bacteria produced proteases that are associated to growth and the maximal protease activity was reached at 30 th hour and 24 th hours of incubation, respectively. Protease produced by Pseudomonas sp. 16 D 4 remained stable at temperature ranging from 0 oC to 70 oC.

40|$|Basic {{theoretical}} and practical aspects of activation parameters are briefly reviewed {{in the context of}} cold-adaptation. In order to reduce the error impact inherent to the transition state theory on the absolute values of the free energy (DeltaG(#)), enthalpy (DeltaH(#)) and entropy (DeltaS(#)) of activation, it is proposed to compare the variation of these parameters between psychrophilic and mesophilic enzymes, namely Delta(DeltaG(#)) (p-m), Delta(DeltaH(#)) (p-m) and Delta(DeltaS(#)) (p-m). Calculation of these parameters from the available literature shows that the main adaptation of psychrophilic enzymes lies in a significant decrease of DeltaH(#), therefore leading to a higher k(cat), especially at low temperatures. Moreover, in all cases including cold-blooded animals, DeltaS(#) exerts an opposite and negative effect on the gain in k(cat). It is argued that the magnitude of this counter-effect of DeltaS(#) can be reduced by keeping some stable domains, while increasing the flexibility of the structures required to improve catalysis at low temperature, as demonstrated in several <b>cold-active</b> <b>enzymes.</b> This enthalpic-entropic balance provides a new approach explaining the two types of conformational stability detected by recent microcalorimetric experiments on psychrophilic enzymes.

Different mature grape varieties with designation of origin were sampled from the region of San Rafael (Mendoza, Argentina), and pectinolytic bacterial, fungal and yeast strains were isolated. The pectinolytic activity was measured by cup-plate assay, quantification of released reducing sugars and viscosity reduction of pectin solution. Two bacteria (Bacillus sp.

To facilitate the management and handling of the enormous amount of data generated when calculating thermodynamic parameters, we have developed a high-throughput interface (Qgui) for automated free energy and empirical valence bond calculations. We present simulations of cold- and warm-adapted trypsin that quantitatively capture experimental catalytic rates of the two enzymes and further yield high-precision Arrhenius plots, which show the characteristic trends in activation enthalpy and entropy. The relationship between these parameters and the 3 D structure is reflected by significantly different internal protein energy changes during the reaction. The origin of this effect is not localized to the active site, but in the outer regions of the protein, where the <b>cold-active</b> <b>enzyme</b> has higher degree of softness. Stiffening the outermost loop regions in cold-adapted trypsin completely changes the enzyme from cold- to warm-adapted in terms of enthalpy and entropy. Several structural mechanisms for softening the protein surface in warm-adapted trypsin are also identified, together with key mutations responsible for this effect. The effect to the thermodynamic activation parameters induced by remote mutations was further investigated utilizing purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP). Here the exact reaction mechanism was not known, and it was thus necessary to resolve this first. The presented reaction mechanism reproduce experimental trends for both reaction rates and thermodynamic activation parameters in native and mutated PNP. Our calculations also show that the human PNP substrate specificity for 6 -oxopurines over 6 -aminopurines originates from significant differences in electrostatic preorganization. Both calculations on trypsin and PNP show that mutations distant to the active site alter the enthalpy-entropy balance without significantly changing the reaction rates. The enthalpy-entropy compensation induced by the mutations originates from altered protein surface softness...|$|E
40|$|The {{earth has}} large cold areas, such as mountains, oceans and (ant) arctic regions, in which organisms {{have evolved to}} survive. This {{adaptation}} happens at a molecular level. The question is, how do proteins adjust such that they function at low temperatures? "Cold-active" or "cold-adapted" enzymes {{have been found to}} be more efficient at low temperatures and less stable than enzymes from organisms living at moderate temperatures (such as mammals). In this study, the structure of a <b>cold-active</b> <b>enzyme,</b> shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP), was determined by x-ray crystallography. It was compared to the structure of a human homologue in order to identify features that explain the adaptation to lower temperatures. This comparison suggests that structure instability of SAP can partly be explained by a reduction in stabilizing interactions, such as fewer hydrophobic residues in the core and lower arginine content. The structure also reveals remarkable differences in charge distribution; it appears that SAP has optimized electrostatic surface potentials in order to attract the substrate, which may increase catalytic efficiency. Alkaline phosphatases contain two zinc ions and one magnesium ion for optimal activity. SAP was however fully occupied with zinc and displayed low residual activity. Crystallographic experiments have shown that one zinc ion can be replaced with magnesium, which seems to happen in conjunction with a conformational change of a ligating histidine. In addition, ligand binding studies have shown that an active site arginine exists in two conformations, which either interacts or does not interact with the bound inhibitor. This observation may have implications for the efficiency of the enzyme. In a conventional single/multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion experiment data are collected at wavelengths near the absorption peak of the element of interest. This method can be simplified by collecting highly redundant data at one "remote" wavelength, where anomalous signals are very small.

At 5 and 15 degrees C, savinase modified with ficol or dextran hydrolyzed fivefold more azocasein than the unmodified savinase. Kinetic studies showed that the catalytic improvements are associated with changes in uncompetitive substrate inhibition with K-i values of modified savinases sixfold higher than the unmodified savinase. Modeling of small-angle scattering data indicates that two substrate molecules bind on opposing sides of the enzyme. The combined kinetic and structural data indicate that the polysaccharide modifier sterically blocks the allosteric site and reduces substrate inhibition.

Psychrophiles include both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and thus represent {{a significant proportion of}} the living world. These organisms produce cold-evolved enzymes that are partially able to cope with the reduction in chemical reaction rates induced by low temperatures. As a rule, <b>cold-active</b> <b>enzymes</b> display a high catalytic efficiency, associated however, with a low thermal stability. In most cases, the adaptation to cold is achieved through a reduction in the activation energy that possibly originates from an increased flexibility of either a selected area or of the overall protein structure. This enhanced plasticity seems in turn to be induced by the weak thermal stability of psychrophilic enzymes. The adaptation strategies are beginning to be understood thanks to recent advances in the elucidation of the molecular characteristics of cold-adapted enzymes derived from X-ray crystallography, protein engineering and biophysical methods. Psychrophilic organisms and their enzymes have, in recent years, increasingly attracted the attention of the scientific community due to their peculiar properties that render them particularly useful in investigating the possible relationship existing between stability, flexibility and specific activity and as valuable tools for biotechnological purposes.

40|$|Microorganisms, {{native to}} the cold environments have {{successfully}} acclimatized their physiological, metabolic and biological features, exhibiting uniqueness in their enzymes, proteins, and membrane structures. These <b>cold-active</b> <b>enzymes</b> have immense biotechnological potential. The diversity of culturable bacteria in two different water lakes (the sub-glacial freshwater and the brackish) of Himalayas was analyzed using SYBR green staining and cultural methods. A total of 140 bacteria were isolated and were grouped as psychrophiles, psychrotrophs and psychrotolerant organisms, based on their optimal temperature for growth. The amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis using three restriction enzymes facilitated the grouping of these isolates into 96 genotypes at ≥ 85 % polymorphism. Phylogenetic analysis using 16 S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the bacterial strains from both lakes belonged to Firmicutes, Proteobacteria (α, β, and γ) or Actinobacteria. Screening of the germplasm for the activity of different cold-active hydrolases such as protease, amylase, xylanase and cellulase, revealed that about sixteen isolates were positive, and exhibiting {{a wide range of}} stability at various temperature and pH. Our results suggest that the distinctly different ecosystems of sub-glacial freshwater and brackish water lakes have diverse groups of bacteria, which can be an excellent source of extracellular hydrolases {{with a wide range of}} thermal stability.

40|$|Studies of <b>cold-active</b> <b>enzymes</b> have {{provided}} basic {{information on the}} molecular and biochemical properties of psychrophiles; however, the physiological strategies that compensate for low-temperature metabolism remain poorly understood. We investigated the cellular pools of ATP and ADP in Psychrobacter cryohalolentis K 5 incubated at eight temperatures between 22 °C and − 80 °C. Cellular ATP and ADP concentrations increased with decreasing temperature, and the most significant increases were observed in cells that were incubated as frozen suspensions (<− 5 °C). Respiratory uncoupling significantly decreased this temperature-dependent response, indicating that the proton motive force was required for energy adaptation to frozen conditions. Since ATP and ADP are key substrates in metabolic and energy conservation reactions, increasing their concentrations may provide a strategy for offsetting the kinetic temperature effect, thereby maintaining reaction rates at low temperature. The adenylate levels increased significantly < 1 h after freezing and also when the cells were osmotically shocked to simulate the elevated solute concentrations encountered in the liquid fraction of the ice. Together, these data demonstrate that a substantial change in cellular energy metabolism {{is required for the}} cell to adapt to the low temperature and water activity conditions encountered during freezing. This physiological response may represent a critical biochemical compensation mechanism at low temperature, have relevance to cellular survival during freezing, and be important for the persistence of microorganisms in icy environments...|$|R
30|$|As {{compared}} to other enzymes frequently sought by metagenomic approaches, proteases have rarely been found by functional screening. Most analyses have been done at 37 °C with skim milk as substrate to detect proteolytic activity (Lee et al. 2007; Neveu et al. 2011; Pushpam et al. 2011). Here, the agar plates were supplemented with the AZCL-casein substrate from Megazyme and the E. coli colonies expressing metagenomic DNA were first incubated at 37 °C for 2 days and then {{for a few weeks}} at ~ 22 °C. Screening at low temperature is sometimes used to search for <b>cold-active</b> <b>enzymes</b> (Yu et al. 2011), and our study shows it to be useful also for the isolation of meso- or thermophilic enzymes requiring a cofactor for stability. Crystallographic studies have revealed an important structural role for calcium ions in various subtilisin-like proteases, resulting in enhanced thermostability and resistance to autolysis (Briedigkeit and Frömmel 1989; Siezen and Leunissen 1997; Smith et al. 1999). While Ca 2 + only increases the optimal temperature of many proteases and notably KP- 43 (from 60 to 70 °C) (Saeki et al. 2002), the biochemically characterized protease to which SBcas 3.3 is most similar, its complete removal by treatment with chelating agents irreversibly denatures some enzymes, such as thermitase (Briedigkeit and Frömmel 1989). This is also the case of the newly identified SBcas 3.3, which requires CaCl 2 at ~ 4 mM concentration for maximal stability.|$|R
40|$|Psychrophiles, host of {{permanently}} cold habitats, display metabolic fluxes {{comparable to}} those exhibited by mesophilic organisms at moderate temperatures. These organisms have evolved by producing, among other peculiarities, <b>cold-active</b> <b>enzymes</b> that have the properties {{to cope with the}} reduction of chemical reaction rates induced by low temperatures. The emerging picture suggests that these enzymes display a high catalytic efficiency at low temperatures through an improved flexibility of the structural components involved in the catalytic cycle, whereas other protein regions, if not implicated in catalysis, may be even more rigid than their mesophilic counterparts. In return, the increased flexibility leads to a decreased stability of psychrophilic enzymes. In order to gain further advances in the analysis of the activity/flexibility/stability concept, psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic DNA ligases have been compared by three-dimensional-modeling studies, as well as regards their activity, surface hydrophobicity, structural permeability, conformational stabilities, and irreversible thermal unfolding. These data show that the cold-adapted DNA ligase is characterized by an increased activity at low and moderate temperatures, an overall destabilization of the molecular edifice, especially at the active site, and a high conformational flexibility. The opposite trend is observed in the mesophilic and thermophilic counterparts, the latter being characterized by a reduced low temperature activity, high stability and reduced flexibility. These results strongly suggest a complex relationship between activity, flexibility and stability. In addition, they also indicate that in cold-adapted enzymes, the driving force for denaturation is a large entropy change. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Enzymes {{with high}} {{specific}} activities at low temperatures have potential uses for chemical conversions when low temperatures are required, {{as in the}} food industry. Psychrotrophic microorganisms which grow at low temperatures may be a valuable source of <b>cold-active</b> <b>enzymes</b> that have higher activities at low temperatures than enzymes found for mesophilic microorganisms. To find cold-active beta-galactosidases, we isolated and characterized several psychrotrophic microorganisms. One isolate, B 7, is an Arthrobacter strain which produces beta-galactosidase when grown in lactose minimal media. Extracts have a specific activity at 30 degrees C of 2 U/mg with o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside as a substrate. Two isozymes were detected when extracts were subjected to electrophoresis in a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and stained for activity with 5 -bromo- 4 -chloro-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal). When chromosomal DNA was prepared and transformed into Escherichia coli, three different genes encoding beta-galactosidase activity were obtained. We have subcloned and sequenced one of these beta-galactosidase genes from the Arthrobacter isolate B 7. On the basis of amino acid sequence alignment, the gene {{was found to have}} probable catalytic sites homologous to those from the E. coli lacZ gene. The gene encoded a protein of 1, 016 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 111 kDa. The enzyme was purified and characterized. The beta-galactosidase from isolate B 7 has kinetic properties {{similar to those of the}} E. coli lacZ beta-galactosidase but has a temperature optimum 20 degrees C lower than that of the E. coli enzyme...|$|R
40|$|The enzyme {{ornithine}} carbamoyltransferase (OTCase) of Moritella abyssi (OTCase Mab), a new, strictly psychrophilic and piezophilic bacterial species, was purified. OTCase Mab displays maximal {{activity at}} rather low temperatures (23 to 25 °C) {{compared to other}} <b>cold-active</b> <b>enzymes</b> and is much less thermoresistant than its homologues from Escherichia coli or thermophilic procaryotes. In vitro the enzyme is in equilibrium between a trimeric state and a dodecameric, more stable state. The melting point and denaturation enthalpy changes for the two forms are considerably lower than the corresponding values for the dodecameric Pyrococcus furiosus OTCase and for a thermolabile trimeric mutant thereof. OTCase Mab displays higher K m values for ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate than mesophilic and thermophilic OTCases and is only weakly inhibited by the bisubstrate analogue �-N-phosphonoacetyl-L-ornithine (PALO). OTCase Mab differs from other, nonpsychrophilic OTCases by substitutions in the most conserved motifs, which probably contribute to the comparatively high K m values and the lower sensitivity to PALO. The K m for ornithine, however, is substantially lower at low temperatures. A survey of the catalytic efficiencies (k cat/K m) of OTCases adapted to different temperatures showed that OTCase Mab activity remains suboptimal at low temperature despite the 4. 5 -fold decrease in the K m value for ornithine observed when the temperature is brought from 20 to 5 °C. OTCase Mab adaptation to cold indicates a trade-off between affinity and catalytic velocity, suggesting that optimization of key metaboli...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} cold-adapted {{microorganisms}} to produce <b>cold-active</b> <b>enzymes</b> with potential biotechnological applications has recently {{attracted the attention}} of scientific community in terms of bioprospecting. This research aimed at assessing the presence and diversity of culturable psychrotrophic bacteria with hydrolytic enzymes activity and their identification using molecular approach. A total of six (6) different Arctic lake sediments were analysed. Mean viable bacterial count ranged from 2. 88 X 103 to 5. 07 X 105 cfu/g. A total of thirty seven (37) bacterial strains were successfully isolated at 20 °C and screened for Amylase, Protease and Lipase activity. Molecular characterization using 16 S rRNA gene sequence homology revealed that the isolated bacteria belong to seven genera comprising Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Dermacoccus, Arthrobacter, Janthinobacterium, Paenibacillus and Chryseobacterium. Eighteen (18) isolates; representing 49 % were found to be positive to {{at least one of the}} three enzymes activity tested. Two different strains of Pseudomonas sp. (isolates 16 D 4 and 17 D 4) were found to be the most potent protease and lipase producing isolates respectively. XIA 12 identified as Bacillus cereus was found to be the most potent amylase producing bacteria. Study of the growth temperature of the isolated bacteria revealed that most of isolates could grow at temperature above 20 °C signifying that the isolates are true psychrotrophs. The findings of this work have confirmed that Arctic environment can serve as an ideal area for biotechnological exploration...|$|R
40|$|Enzymes {{active at}} low {{temperature}} are {{of great interest}} for industrial bioprocesses due to their highefficiency at a low energy cost. One of the particularities of naturally evolved <b>cold-active</b> <b>enzymes</b> istheir increased enzymatic activity at low temperature, however the low thermostability presented inthis type of enzymes is still a major drawback for their application in biocatalysis. Directed evolutionof cold-adapted enzymes to a more thermostable version, appears as an attractive strategy to fulfill thestability and activity requirements for the industry. This paper describes the recombinant expression andcharacterization {{of a new and}} highly active cold-adapted xylanase from the GH-family 10 (Xyl-L), andthe use of a novel one step combined directed evolution technique that comprises saturation mutage-nesis and focused epPCR as a feasible semi-rational strategy to improve the thermostability. The Xyl-Lenzyme was cloned from a marine-Antarctic bacterium, Psychrobacter sp. strain 2 – 17, recombinantlyexpressed in E. coli strain BL 21 (DE 3) and characterized enzymatically. Molecular dynamic simulationsusing a homology model of the catalytic domain of Xyl-L were performed to detect flexible regions andresidues, which are considered to be the possible structural elements that define the thermolability ofthis enzyme. Mutagenic libraries were designed in order to stabilize the protein introducing mutationsin some of the flexible regions and residues identified. Twelve positive mutant clones were found toimprove the T 5015 value of the enzyme, in some cases without affecting the activity at 25 ◦C. The bestmutant showed a 4. 3 ◦C increase in its T 5015. The efficiency of the directed evolution approach can alsobe expected to work in the protein engineering of stereoselectivity...|$|R
40|$|Marine {{bioprospecting}} is {{a highly}} topical research subject since the marine ecosystem is a relatively unexplored source of enzymes with potential biocatalytic activity. Development of new biocatalysts from marine extreme environments, such as Polar Regions, can be considered value-added. In fact, there is an increasing demand in bio discovering powerful biocatalysts for biotechnological applications in terms of esterase/lipases from cold environments. This is due to their salt tolerance, hyperthermostability, barophilicity, cold adaptivity, substrate specificity and affinity. The first session of the research project was focused on functional-based screening method to screen a collection of 100 marine bacteria isolated from Svalbard and Lofoten islands {{for their ability to}} produce a broad spectrum of <b>cold-active</b> <b>enzymes.</b> The isolated bacteria were classified by 16 S rRNA sequencing and the phylogenetic distribution of the detected activities was evaluated with the interest for finding new cold-active biocatalysts. In the second session of the project, a gene encoding for an esterase was amplified by PCR from a bacterial sequenced genome belonging to Thalassospira sp. GB 04 J 01. After cloning and gene heterologous expression in E. coli, the recombinant protein was obtained as high level in soluble form and then purified to homogeneity. A full structural and functional protein characterization was carried on and in addition, the enzyme was able to form diamond crystals which diffracted at 1. 7 Å. This was the first biochemical characterization and structural analysis of a cold-active esterase isolated from the genus Thalassospira. A parallel session of the project was aimed at identifying and at characterizing a new cold-active and salt tolerant esterase isolated from Arctic metagenomic libraries. Taking advantage of an “omic” technique, such as Metagenomics, it was possible to access to unculturable microbes in such extreme environment, the Arctic. A fosmid containing an ORF encoding a gene with potential esterase/lipase activity was detected by functional screening on tributyrin agar plates. The positive clones employing the largest halo size were sequenced and a gene encoding a putative lipase was found. Gene cloning and expression were followed by a production of the recombinant protein in a soluble form. A biochemical approach highlighted protein features with a functional characterization methodology. To achieve the summarized results several expertise in different research fields were required. The research activity was realized through short exchanges of researchers between Italy and Norway. This research project and the data obtained strongly represent a contribution to enhance the market of <b>cold-active</b> lipolytic <b>enzymes</b> of white biotechnology field as powerful biocatalysts...|$|R
40|$|Antarctic {{bacteria}} producing extracellular lipolytic enzymes {{with activity}} at low temperature were isolated, {{and the most}} promising strain, named G, {{was identified as a}} Psychrobacter species based on 16 S rDNA sequence alignment. The genomic DNA of this bacterium was used to construct its plasmid genomic library into pUC 118 plasmid vectors, and to screen the <b>cold-active</b> lipolytic <b>enzyme</b> genes. Two genes encoding for <b>cold-active</b> lipolytic <b>enzymes,</b> Lip- 1452 (with an open reading frame of 1452 bp in length) and Lip- 948 (with an open reading frame of 948 bp in length), were screened. The primary structure of the two lipases deduced from the nucleotide sequence showed a consensus pen-tapeptide containing the active serine (Lip- 1452, GDSAG, and Lip- 948, GNSMG) and a conserved His-Gly dipeptide in the N-terminal part of the enzyme. Protein sequence alignment and conserved regions analysis indicated that the two lipases probably belonged to family IV and family V of the bacterial lipolytic enzymes, respectively. The upstream and downstream sequences of the two lipolytic lipases were also obtained. The two lipase genes were cloned into the expression vector pCold III and integrated into Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE 3). The functional expression of both lipase genes by E. coli BL 21 (DE 3) cells was observed as the formation of clear haloes around colonies on a 1 % (vol/vol) tributyrin plate upon induction with isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside at 5 °C. A lipase activity assay showed that the specific activity of the pCold III+Lip- 948 expression system was up to 3. 7 U ml- 1, whereas that of pCold III+Lip- 1452 was very low...|$|R
