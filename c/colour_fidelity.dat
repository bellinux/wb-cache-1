40|$|The CIE Colour Rendering Index (CRI), {{defined in}} CIE 13. 3 - 1995, in {{particular}} the general colour rendering index, Ra, is widely adopted and used by the lighting industry, in regulatory documents and in international and regional standards and specifications. However, limitations of the CRI have been recently addressed, especially for solid-state light sources, whereby the Ra values do not always correlate well with visual evaluation by general users. This mismatch arises, first, from inaccuracies of the CRI in its intended role as a <b>colour</b> <b>fidelity</b> index; and second, from perception-related colour quality effects beyond <b>colour</b> <b>fidelity.</b> It {{was determined by the}} CIE that, for both aspects, better colour quality characterization methods are needed to measure and specify white-light sources, and the work was divided into two corresponding tasks: (1) to develop a scientifically accurate <b>colour</b> <b>fidelity</b> index, assigned to TC 1 - 90, and (2) to develop one or more perception-related colour quality measures beyond fidelity, assigned to TC 1 - 91 for initial work. This Technical Report, developed by TC 1 - 90, is a research report describing a general <b>colour</b> <b>fidelity</b> index, Rf, as a scientifically accurate measure of <b>colour</b> <b>fidelity</b> with respect to a reference illuminant, although there still remain some technical issues for further research. This <b>colour</b> <b>fidelity</b> index, based on the fidelity index of the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, defined in TM- 30 - 15, addresses aspects for only {{the first part of the}} limitations of the CRI – it does not address the need for perception-related colour quality measure(s) beyond fidelity. However, it does address several previously reported inaccuracies of the CRI as a <b>colour</b> <b>fidelity</b> measure. The important improvements of this measure, relative to the CRI, are the update of the colour difference calculation, {{in particular the}} object colour space, and the incorporation of 99 test-colour samples which provide a more uniform distribution of slope and curvature values as a function of wavelength and which have colour appearance values that are more widely and uniformly distributed in the three dimensions of a uniform colour space. The general <b>colour</b> <b>fidelity</b> index, Rf, represents how closely the colour appearances of the entire sample set are reproduced (rendered) on average by a test light as compared to those under a reference illuminant. Thus, similar to the general colour rendering index, Ra, the general <b>colour</b> <b>fidelity</b> index, Rf, combines the computed colour differences for all test-colour samples in one single average index value, and is only one aspect of colour quality not considering perception/preference effects. Therefore, it is considered that such unintended uses of CRI as an overall colour quality measure for end users is not better fulfilled by the more scientifically accurate general <b>colour</b> <b>fidelity</b> index, Rf. This is because the users’ evaluation is influenced by factors beyond <b>colour</b> <b>fidelity</b> such as chroma effects, and the detailed nature of specific illumination tasks. The general <b>colour</b> <b>fidelity</b> index, Rf, is therefore not a replacement of the general colour rendering index, Ra, neither for the purpose of rating and specification of products nor for regulatory or other minimum performance requirements. Replacement of the CRI will be a matter of future study and discussion that will include the evaluation of the general <b>colour</b> <b>fidelity</b> index, Rf, along with development of a harmonized set of new colour quality measures for assessing perception-related effects beyond <b>colour</b> <b>fidelity</b> and practical aspects for manufacturers and end-users.

The system enables the user to reconstruct documents, which often could not be reconstructed by hand. By this system {{the information contained in}} the documents can be made usable again. The process of the assistance system is divided into the four phases of Digitalization, Feature-Extraction, Context Matching and Interactive Viewer. In the first phase the fragile and often twisted strips to be reconstructed have to be separated and straightened. They then need to be scanned double-sided, anechoic, and shadeless as well as with highest <b>colour</b> and geometrical <b>fidelity</b> compared to the originals. In the second phase the strips are segmented pixel by pixel from the raw scans. Foreground from background information is separated and describing content features for a discriminative similarity comparison are extracted from the digitized strips. The third phase works {{on the basis of these}} calculated features. At first a search space reduction is carried out. Afterwards a pairwise context matching is executed by using dynamic programming algorithms. Thereby similarity scores of all possible combinations of shredder strip pairs are calculated. On the basis of these scores a semi-automatic reconstruction is performed in the interactive viewer in phase four. By doing so strip-pairs are put together gradually to grow partial reconstructions up to complete reconstructed documents by user interaction.

40|$|Traditionally, the CIE colour {{rendering}} index {{has been used}} to described the colour rendition of white light sources. However, almost immediately after its standardization in 1974 there has been a growing body of literature and anecdotal evidence showing that it fails to accurately predict the colour rendition of narrow-band or spiked spectra. This has increasingly become a problem with the advent of Solid-State Lighting, as the inability to correctly assess the colour rendition of these light sources might hinder the acceptance of this new lighting technology. The failure has been shown to occur on two different fronts: 1) {{colour rendering}} or <b>colour</b> <b>fidelity</b> – an objective measure comparing the colour appearance under the test source with that under a reference illuminant; and 2) colour quality – referring to subjective aspects of colour rendition, such as preference, naturalness, vividness, harmony, … This paper focuses on the first aspect of colour rendition, i. e. <b>colour</b> <b>fidelity.</b> It summarizes {{the development of a new}} <b>colour</b> <b>fidelity</b> index, called the CRI 2012, which improves upon some of the shortcomings of the CIE CRI calculation, like its outdated chromatic adaptation transform and perceptually non-uniform colour space, by updating them to the state of the art in colour appearance modeling. A new colour difference averaging and rescaling function is also proposed. But, most importantly, the CRI 2012 replaces the Munsell test samples with two new sample sets: one spectrally uniform set, the HL 17 set, to calculate a game-free general Ra, 2012 index and another, the Real 210, to provide hue specific information. The rationale behind the choice of the new and separate sample set for the general index is that uniformity in colour space is not a sufficient condition to ensure light source spectra cannot be gamed. What is needed is uniform sampling in wavelength space. At the moment the game-free set is still a mathematical set, but there is being actively worked on replacing it with a larger, spectrally uniform, set composed of real reflectance functions that adequately samples both wavelength and colour space, thereby replacing the need for the Real 210 set. In addition, the possibility of updating the reference illuminant calculation is also being investigated. To avoid the discontinuity at 5000 K – when the reference illuminant switches type – one might calculate the reference illuminant from, let’s say 4500 K to 5500 K, with a weighted mean of a Planckian radiator and a daylight phase, whereby the weighting is a smooth (non) -linearly increasing function of CCT. status: publishe...|$|E

From the limited analysis performed on his later paintings, it is clear that Bauer’s pigment use changed as he evolved toward the more time consuming and technically challenging transparent watercolour painting style where he abandoned more opaque pigments such as vermillion, copper blues and greens, red lead and lead white in favour of more transparent pigments.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Electronic {{projection}} display technology had its {{origin in the}} Oil film projector system. Developed in the early 1940 s oil film projectors have been the workhorse for applications that require {{projection display}}s of the highest brightness. But due to various limitations a number of solid state technologies have challenged the oil firm projector, including CRT-LCD light valves and active-matrix- LCD panels. In response to various limitations of the LCD technologies and to provide superior image quality, high brightness projection display systems have been developed based on Digital Light Processing technology.

40|$|Last {{advances}} in sensors, photogrammetry and computer vision {{have led to}} high-automation levels of 3 D reconstruction processes for generating dense models and multispectral orthoimages from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images. However, these cartographic products are sometimes blurred and degraded due to sun reflection effects which reduce the image contrast and <b>colour</b> <b>fidelity</b> in photogrammetry {{and the quality of}} radiometric values in remote sensing applications. This paper proposes an automatic approach for detecting sun reflections problems (hotspot and sun glint) in multispectral images acquired with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), based on a photogrammetric strategy included in a flight planning and control software developed by the authors. In particular, two main consequences are derived from the approach developed: (i) different areas of the images can be excluded since they contain sun reflection problems; (ii) the cartographic products obtained (e. g., digital terrain model, orthoimages) and the agronomical parameters computed (e. g., normalized vegetation index-NVDI) are improved since radiometric defects in pixels are not considered. Finally, an accuracy assessment was performed in order to analyse the error in the detection process, getting errors around 10 pixels for a ground sample distance (GSD) of 5 cm which is perfectly valid for agricultural applications. This error confirms that the precision in the detection of sun reflections can be guaranteed using this approach and the current low-cost UAV technology...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{photography}} is now widely used to document orthodontic patients. High quality intra-oral photography {{depends on a}} satisfactory ‘depth of field ’ focus and good illumination. Automatic ‘through the lens ’ (TTL) metering is ideal to achieve both the above aims. Ten current digital single lens reflex (SLR) cameras were tested for use in intra- and extra-oral photography as used in orthodontics. The manufacturers ’ recommended macro-lens and macro-flash were used with each camera. Handling characteristics, colour-reproducibility, quality of the viewfinder and flash recharge time were investigated. No camera took acceptable images in factory default setting or ‘automatic ’ mode: this mode was not present for some cameras (Nikon, Fujifilm); led to overexposure (Olympus) or poor depth of field (Canon, Konica-Minolta, Pentax), particularly for intra-oral views. Once adjusted, only Olympus cameras {{were able to take}} intra- and extra-oral photographs without the need to change settings, and were therefore the easiest to use. All other cameras needed adjustments of aperture (Canon, Konica-Minolta, Pentax), or aperture and flash (Fujifilm, Nikon), making the latter the most complex to use. However, all cameras produced high quality intra- and extra-oral images, once appropriately adjusted. The resolution of the images is more than satisfactory for all cameras. There were significant differences relating to the quality of colour reproduction, size and brightness of the viewfinders.

40|$|A common {{solution}} for transferring images from one device to another without loss of <b>colour</b> <b>fidelity</b> is to characterise each device {{in terms of}} CIE tristimulus values. For example, {{it would be possible}} with appropriate characterisation procedures to convert the LCD RGB values to CIE XYZ values and vice versa. Characterisation of devices into a standard colour space that is independent of the device reduces the number of transformations which may be required for adequate performance. The first stage in characterisation is to linearise the data termed "gamma correction" for certain devices and then transform the linearised values in CIE XYZ tristimulus values. In order to determine the non-linearity of the characterisation and the matrix for linear conversion between RGB and XYZ it is normal to make colour measurements of certain colour patches displayed on the system. However, it is known that the colour measurements of the patches may vary with the colour and luminance of the background against which they are displayed. Lack of spatial independence is one of the factors that can cause this phenomenon. This raises the question of what the nature of the background should be for an optimal characterisation of a display system. It is likely that what is optimal will depend upon the intended application of the characterised display (for example, is it being used to display simple images in a psychophysical experiment or more complex images in some other setting). This research considers characterisation with four background conditions (white, grey, black and a new Mondrian-like coloured background) and explores the effect of these background effects on the characterisation model’s parameters and on the usefulness of the characterisation in various imaging scenarios...|$|E
30|$|There are {{multiple}} challenges in analysing pigments in historic watercolour paintings on paper, and typically non-invasive, in situ methods are required. Recent developments in portable analytical instrumentation {{have made this}} more accessible to heritage institutions, but many commercial systems are not optimised for the specific requirements of manuscripts and works on paper. This paper describes the successful use of Raman spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) and hyperspectral imaging to identify and map watercolour pigments used by the eighteenth century botanical illustrator, Ferdinand Bauer, and demystify the unusual colour code system found in his sketches. The value, delicate nature and large size of these paintings necessitated the use of using in situ, non-contact methods of analysis. A portable, bespoke Raman spectrometer specifically designed for analysing pigments from works on paper was used together with a bespoke portable Fibre optic reflectance spectrometer, portable X-Ray Fluorescence spectrometer and a hyperspectral imaging sensor. The results demonstrate that {{although there is a}} significant compromise between achieving good Raman spectroscopic results from artists’ pigments and using sufficiently low laser power densities so as not to cause damage to the pigments, good results could be obtained with this portable system, particularly when combined with XRF, fibre optic reflectance spectroscopy (FORS) and hyperspectral imaging. Eight pigments were identified unequivocally from 125 watercolour paintings analysed, suggesting that Bauer used a more traditional and more limited palette than previously considered, and that his palette changed significantly in his later paintings. Similar pigments identified by the authors on colour chart that was discovered in 1999 in Madrid and attributed to Bauer, add weight to the attribution of this chart to Bauer.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Developments in technology have meant that computercontrolled imaging devices are becoming more powerful and more affordable. Despite their increasing prevalence, computer-aided design and desktop publishing software has failed to keep pace, leading to disappointing colour reproduction across different devices. Although {{there has been a}} recent drive to incorporate colour management functionality into modern computer systems, in general this is limited in scope and fails to properly consider the way in which colours are perceived. Furthermore, differences in viewing conditions or representation severely impede the communication of colour between groups of users. The approach proposed here is to provide WYSIWYG colour across a range of imaging devices through a combination of existing device characterisation and colour appearance modeling techniques. In addition, to further facilitate colour communication, various common colour notation systems are defined by a series of mathematical mappings. This enables both the implementation of computer-based colour atlases (which have a number of practical advantages over physical specifiers) and also the interrelation of colour represented in hitherto incompatible notations. Together with the proposed solution, details are given of a computer system which has been implemented. The system was used by textile designers for a real task. Prior to undertaking this work, designers were interviewed in order to ascertain where colour {{played an important role in}} their work and where it was found to be a problem. A summary of the findings of these interviews together with a survey of existing approaches to the problems of <b>colour</b> <b>fidelity</b> and communication in colour computer systems are also given. As background to this work, the topics of colour science and colour imaging are introduced...|$|E
40|$|There are {{multiple}} challenges in analysing pigments in historic watercolour paintings on paper, and typically non-invasive, in situ methods are required. Recent developments in portable analytical instrumentation {{have made this}} more accessible to heritage institutions, but many commercial systems are not optimised for the specific requirements of manuscripts and works on paper. This paper describes the successful use of Raman spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) and hyperspectral imaging to identify and map watercolour pigments used by the eighteenth century botanical illustrator, Ferdinand Bauer, and demystify the unusual colour code system found in his sketches. The value, delicate nature and large size of these paintings necessitated the use of using in situ, non-contact methods of analysis. A portable, bespoke Raman spectrometer specifically designed for analysing pigments from works on paper was used together with a bespoke portable Fibre optic reflectance spectrometer, portable X-Ray Fluorescence spectrometer and a hyperspectral imaging sensor. The results demonstrate that {{although there is a}} significant compromise between achieving good Raman spectroscopic results from artists’ pigments and using sufficiently low laser power densities so as not to cause damage to the pigments, good results could be obtained with this portable system, particularly when combined with XRF, fibre optic reflectance spectroscopy (FORS) and hyperspectral imaging. Eight pigments were identified unequivocally from 125 watercolour paintings analysed, suggesting that Bauer used a more traditional and more limited palette than previously considered, and that his palette changed significantly in his later paintings. Similar pigments identified by the authors on colour chart that was discovered in 1999 in Madrid and attributed to Bauer, add weight to the attribution of this chart to Bauer. The data provides a much deeper insight into Bauer’s colour annotations, and how he was able to achieve such an impressive degree of <b>colour</b> <b>fidelity</b> in his work...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{applicability}} of colour quality metrics to solid-state light sources is validated {{and the results}} of the assessment of colour rendition characteristics of various lamps are presented. The standard colour rendering index metric (CRI) or a refined colour quality scale metric (CQS) fail to distinguish between two principle colour rendition properties of illumination: the ability to render object colours with high fidelity and the ability to increase chromatic contrast, especially when the spectra of light sources contain a few narrow-band electroluminescence components. Supplementing these metrics by the known figures of merit that measure the gamut area of a small number of test colour samples does not completely resolve this issue. In contrast, the statistical approach, which is based on sorting {{a very large number of}} test colour samples with respect of just perceivable colour distortions of several kinds, offers a comprehensive assessment of colour rendition properties of solid-state light sources. In particular, two statistical indices, <b>colour</b> <b>fidelity</b> index (CFI) and colour saturation index (CSI), which are the relative numbers of object colours rendered with high fidelity and increased saturation, respectively, are sufficient to reveal and assess three distinct types of solid state light sources. These are (i) high-fidelity lamps, which cover the entire spectrum with the spectral components present in the wavelength ranges of both 530 - 610 nm and beyond 610 nm (e. g. trichromatic warm white phosphor converted LEDs, red-amber-green-blue LED clusters, complementary clusters of white and coloured LEDs); (ii) colour-saturating lamps, which lack power in the 530 - 610 nm wavelength range (e. g. red-green-blue or red-cyan-blue LED clusters); and (iii) colour dulling lamps, which lack power for wavelengths longer than 610 nm (dichromatic daylight phosphor converted LEDs and amber-green-blue LED clusters). Owing to a single statistical format, CSI and CFI can be used for design and optimization of multiwavelength LED clusters providing " smart " illumination with a trade-off between different colour rendition characteristics...|$|E
