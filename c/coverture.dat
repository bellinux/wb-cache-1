5|$|At {{the time}} British law {{relating}} to marriage {{was based on}} the legal doctrine of <b>coverture,</b> in which a woman's legal rights and obligations were subsumed by those of her husband upon their matrimony. By law a woman had no separate legal existence, and all her property became her husband's; divorce initiated by a woman was difficult and complicated. In April 1868 Josephine and fellow suffragist Elizabeth Wolstenholme set up and became joint secretaries of the Married Women's Property Committee to pressure parliament into changing the law. Josephine remained on the committee until the campaign was successful, with the passing into law of the Married Women's Property Act 1882.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century some women, such as Ernestine Rose, Paulina Wright Davis, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Harriet Beecher Stowe, in the United States and Britain {{began to}} {{challenge}} laws that denied {{them the right}} to their property once they married. Under the common law doctrine of <b>coverture</b> husbands gained control of their wives' real estate and wages. Beginning in the 1840s, state legislatures in the United States and the British Parliament began passing statutes that protected women's property from their husbands and their husbands' creditors. These laws were known as the Married Women's Property Acts. Courts in the 19th-century United States also continued to require privy examinations of married women who sold their property. A privy examination was a practice in which a married woman who wished to sell her property had to be separately examined by a judge or justice of the peace outside of the presence of her husband and asked if her husband was pressuring her into signing the document.|$|E
25|$|In Islam, {{there is}} no <b>coverture,</b> an idea central in European, American {{as well as in}} non-Islamic Asian common law, and the legal basis for the {{principle}} of marital property. An Islamic marriage is a contract {{between a man and a}} woman. A Muslim man and woman do not merge their legal identity upon marriage, and do not have rights over any shared marital property. The assets of the man before the marriage, and earned by him after the marriage, remain his during marriage and in case of a divorce. A divorce under Islamic law does not require redistribution of property. Rather, each spouse walks away from the marriage with his or her individual property. Divorcing Muslim women who did not work outside their home after marriage do not have a claim on the collective wealth of the couple under Islamic law, except for deferred mahr – an amount of money or property the man agrees to pay her before the woman signs the marriage contract.|$|E

40|$|Biological {{monitoring}} is {{a powerful}} tool for understanding ecological patterns and processes, implementing sound management practices, and determining wildlife conservation strategies. In Mexico, regional long-term bird monitoring has been undertaken only over the last decade. Two comprehensive programs have incorporated bird monitoring as the main tool for assessing the impact of human productive activities on birds and habitats at local and regional levels: the Integrated Ecosystem Management (IEM) and the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor Mexico (CBMM). These programs are implemented in supremely important biodiverse regions in the southern and southeastern states of Mexico. Bird monitoring activities are based on the recruitment and participation of local people linked to sustainable productive projects promoted by the CBMM or IEM. Through a series of training workshops delivered by specialists, local monitors receive equipment and coordinate to become part of a large monitoring network that facilitates regional <b>covertures.</b> This data currently being obtained by local people will enable the mid- and long-term assessment of the impacts of sustainable human productive activities on birds and biodiversity. Community-based bird monitoring programs are a promising opportunity for enhancing scientific knowledge, improving sustainable practices, and supporting wildlife conservation in areas of high biodiversity...|$|R

Using these methods {{it has been}} possible to correlate modern mammalian community structure and habitat. In turn these correlations {{have been used to}} infer palaeohabitat from analysis of the structure of extinct mammal communities. We used the cenogram method to construct the body {{size distribution}} of both contemporary and pre-European invasion lists of mammal taxa from 52 Australian national parks spanning all major environments. All modern Australian open environments showed a gap in body mass distribution. Historical open environments showed no distinct gap in body mass distribution but had significantly less medium-sized species than closed environments. Large, introduced mammalian predators have been shown to prefer medium-sized prey over large or small prey and to contribute signi!cantly to the extinction of medium-sized species in open environments. Our results are consistent with previous studies which have found that mid-sized mammals are more extinction prone, and this has been suggested to be due to introduced cats and foxes, following the European colonization of Australia. Two methods complementary to cenograms are introduced in this study, which are useful to infer vegetation <b>covertures</b> of fossil localities...|$|R

40|$|In {{the south}} of Europe, namely in Portugal or Spain, lawns invaded the gardens. Historically, lawns {{did not belong to}} the {{mediterranean}} garden, but, by anglo-normand influence the turfgrass is now used everywhere (Filippi, 2011). We expect that plants can help us to solve our ecological, technical or social problems. However, the use of plants can bring us some problems too. The use of plants in urban spaces is extremely social and cultural conditioned especially if we think about naturalistic plantings (Hitchmough & Dunnet, 2004). Lawns are an idyllic green soil cover very desired by general public in the Mediterranean climate. But the energy and water necessary to maintain a lawn in Mediterranean conditions is very expensive, economically and ecologically unsustainable. Ornamental meadows are an alternative that has qualities to substitute lawns in extensive framing areas in urban space. It is a very sustainable and biodiverse alternative that is already being used in many cities (Gilsoul, 2011). Ornamental meadows can help us to create more sustainable, diverse and interesting green spaces. Plants with interesting flowers can be used in ornamental meadows and create a spectacular blooming season. 	In this work we proposed to study the way Landscape Architects choice to use lawns or ornamental meadows in a Mediterranean climate were water to irrigate is a limit factor. How they are influenced by themes like sustainability, ecology or biodiversity, or conditioned by political or social opinions in their design of urban green spaces, were questions explored. 	The methodology used was surveys directed to active Landscape Architects designers that work in the South of Europe in a Mediterranean climate. Questions about what influences their choices when they have to choose between using lawns or ornamental meadows were asked. 	This theme was explored in order to understand what conditions the use of lawns or ornamental meadows at the designing level. With this work we hope to contribute to the knowledge about the use of plants <b>covertures</b> in cities in the South Europe...|$|R

All that was required was for both parties to agree to the union, so long as each had reached the legal age of consent, which was 12for girls and 14for boys. Women were completely subordinated to their husbands after marriage, the husband and wife becoming one legal entity, a legal status known as <b>coverture.</b> As the eminent English judge SirWilliamBlackstone wrote in 1753: [...] "the very being, or legal existence of the woman, is suspended during the marriage, or at least is consolidated and incorporated into that of her husband: under whose wing, protection and cover, she performs everything". Married women could not own property in their own right, and were indeed themselves the property of their husbands.

It was not difficult to find misery in Liverpool." [...] Her targets included obtaining the vote, the right to better education and the end of <b>coverture</b> in British law, although she achieved her greatest success in leading the movement to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts, legislation that attempted to control the spread of venereal diseases, particularly in the British Army and Royal Navy.
