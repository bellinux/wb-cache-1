500|$|In the Comparative Civilizations Review journal, Anthony M. Stevens-Arroyo {{proclaimed that}} it was easy [...] "to get lost" [...] in Dreamtime, believing that the {{multitude}} of ethnographic and historical facts presented by Duerr often distracted from the book's main arguments. Although praising the book's contents, Stevens-Arroyo expressed his annoyance at Duerr's use of humour, believing {{that it was}} inappropriate in such a serious work of scholarship. He also remarked that Duerr [...] "practices what he preaches", noting that the book was something of an apologia for {{his involvement in the}} counter-cultural and drug subcultures of the 1960s and his continuing advocacy of the use of mind-altering substances, in the same style as Timothy Leary. Considering the work to be an attack on social convention, he believes that Duerr has made use of mind-altering drugs to <b>cross</b> <b>boundaries</b> into altered states of consciousness and that Dreamtime is his invitation for others to join him. Stevens-Arroyo did praise Goodman's English translation, but argued that the index was too limited.|$|E

You meet bad things. These are stories of contact and conflict, of a border that is more cultural than political." [...] According to Haaretz, [...] "excavation directors Prof. Shlomo Bunimovitz and Dr. Zvi Lederman of Tel Aviv University say they do not suggest that the human figure on the seal is the biblical Samson. Rather, the geographical proximity to the area where Samson lived, and the time period of the seal, show that a story was being told at the time of a hero who fought a lion, and that the story eventually found its way into the biblical text and onto the seal." ...|$|E

2500|$|Surrealism {{has contributed}} {{greatly to the}} works of Asturias. Characterized by its {{exploration}} of the subconscious mind, the genre allowed Asturias to <b>cross</b> <b>boundaries</b> of [...] fantasy and reality. Although Asturias' works were seen as preceding magical realism, the author saw many similarities between the two genres. Asturias discussed the idea of magical realism in his own works linking it explicitly to surrealism. He did not, however, use the term to describe his own material. He used it instead {{in reference to the}} Mayan stories written before the conquest of America by the Europeans, stories such as Popul Vuh or Los Anales de los Xahil. In an interview with his friend and biographer Günter W. Lorenz, Asturias discusses how these stories fit his view of magical realism and relate to surrealism, saying, [...] "Between the [...] "real" [...] and the [...] "magic" [...] there is a third sort of reality. It is a melting of the visible and the tangible, the hallucination and the dream. It is similar to what the surrealists around [...] Breton wanted and it is what we could call [...] "magic realism." [...] Although the two genres shared much in common, magical realism is often considered as having been born in Latin America.|$|E
