5|$|Adler {{wrote in}} his memoir that the passion of his future wife Sonya Oberlander (and of her family) for theater, and their vision of what Yiddish theater <b>could</b> <b>become,</b> kept him in the {{profession}} despite his uncle's view. When she was cast by Rosenberg opposite Jacob Spivakovsky {{in the title role}} of Abraham Goldfaden's darkly comic operetta Breindele Cossack, she pulled strings so that the role of Guberman would be reassigned to Adler.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{difference was that}} the charioteers themselves, the aurigae, {{were considered to be}} the winners, although they were usually also slaves (as in the Greek world). They received a wreath of laurel leaves, and probably some money; if they won enough races they could buy their freedom. Drivers <b>could</b> <b>become</b> celebrities throughout the Empire simply by surviving, as the life expectancy of a charioteer was not very high. One such celebrity driver was Scorpus, who won over 2000 races before being killed in a collision at the meta when he was about 27 years old. The most famous of all was Gaius Appuleius Diocles who won 1,462 out of 4,257 races. When Diocles retired at the age of 42 after a 24-year career his winnings reportedly totalled 35,863,120 sesterces ($US 15 billion), making him the highest paid sports star in history. The horses, too, <b>could</b> <b>become</b> celebrities, but their life expectancy was also low. The Romans kept detailed statistics of the names, breeds, and pedigrees of famous horses.|$|E
5|$|Chapter Four {{lists the}} powers and {{duties of the}} Parliament of Belarus, which is called the National Assembly. The National Assembly itself {{is divided into two}} houses: the lower House of Representatives and the upper Council of the Republic.

It crashed just past the end of the runway, killing all 47 passengers and two of the three crew. The flight's first officer was the only survivor.|$|E

5|$|A 19th-century ethnographic account {{from eastern}} Herzegovina {{describes}} a way through {{which a man}} who was not born as a zduhać <b>could</b> <b>become</b> one. Forty days after he ceased praying to God and washing his face, the man should go to some level ground, before he drew a circle on the ground and sat in its centre. Soon the Devil would come and ask the man whether he was willing to join his army, and what form he wanted to be transformed into. When the man stated the desired form, the Devil would turn him into that, making him a zduhać. In the region of Semberija, northeast Bosnia, а zduhać could pass his supernatural power on to his son.|$|E
5|$|Although {{romantic love}} was not discouraged, marriages were {{arranged}} as agreements and bonds formed between two clans (with property {{as the chief}} concern), not necessarily two individuals. A father's input on who his sons and daughters should marry carried more weight than the mother, although a grandfather could override a father's decision. Once a couple had married, the new wife was obligated to visit the family temple so she <b>could</b> <b>become</b> part of the husband's clan and be properly worshipped by her descendants after death. However, she retained her natal surname. The {{vast majority of people}} during Han practiced monogamy, although wealthy officials and nobles could afford to support one or many concubines in addition to their legal wife.|$|E

5|$|Arafat's long {{personal}} and political survival was taken by most Western commentators {{as a sign of}} his mastery of asymmetric warfare and his skill as a tactician, given the extremely dangerous nature of politics of the Middle East and the frequency of assassinations. Some commentators believe his survival was largely due to Israel's fear that he <b>could</b> <b>become</b> a martyr for the Palestinian cause if he were assassinated or even arrested by Israel. Others believe that Israel refrained from taking action against Arafat because it feared Arafat less than Hamas and the other Islamist movements gaining support over Fatah. The complex and fragile web of relations between the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states contributed also to Arafat's longevity {{as the leader of the}} Palestinians.|$|E
5|$|At other times, Krichell {{collected}} some of {{the best}} prospects in an area, normally 300 or more, and put them through a four-day workout. It normally consisted of practice in the morning and a full game in the afternoon. There, Krichell and his staff sorted though players they believed <b>could</b> <b>become</b> useful in the organization, and dropped those they thought lacked motivation. The few players who survived the workout were assigned by Krichell to the Yankees Minor League hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} legal status as {{citizens}} {{and the degree to}} which they <b>could</b> <b>become</b> emancipated, women could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business, including shipping, manufacturing, and lending money. Inscriptions throughout the Empire honour women as benefactors in funding public works, an indication they could acquire and dispose of considerable fortunes; for instance, the Arch of the Sergii was funded by Salvia Postuma, a female member of the family honoured, and the largest building in the forum at Pompeii was funded by Eumachia, a priestess of Venus.|$|E

5|$|Cleanup efforts {{after the}} storm were hastened as Hurricane Gonzalo {{approached}} from the south, amid concerns that strewn debris from Fay <b>could</b> <b>become</b> airborne and exacerbate future destruction. The unanticipated heavy damage from Fay prompted residents to prepare more thoroughly for Gonzalo, as evidenced by stores reporting an influx of customers purchasing emergency supplies. Two hundred Bermuda Regiment soldiers helped clear debris and began repairing structural damage. On October 13, crews of soldiers put tarpaulins on 30 homes with roof damage, as well as distributing another 150 tarps to homeowners.|$|E
5|$|Conditions on Titan <b>could</b> <b>become</b> {{far more}} {{habitable}} {{in the far}} future. Five billion years from now, as the Sun becomes a red giant, its surface temperature could rise enough for Titan to support liquid water on its surface, making it habitable. As the Sun's ultraviolet output decreases, the haze in Titan's upper atmosphere will be depleted, lessening the anti-greenhouse effect {{on the surface and}} enabling the greenhouse created by atmospheric methane to play a far greater role. These conditions together could create a habitable environment, and could persist for several hundred million years. This is proposed to have been sufficient time for simple life to spawn on Earth, though the presence of ammonia on Titan would cause chemical reactions to proceed more slowly.|$|E
5|$|During {{the clay}} season, Federer's {{victory in the}} Hamburg Masters final was {{particularly}} impressive, as it snapped Rafael Nadal's 81-match winning streak on clay, an Open-Era record. Federer turned the match around from a set down to sweep 12 of the final 14 games, including a final set bagel. At the French Open, some anticipated that Federer <b>could</b> <b>become</b> the first man in almost 40 years to hold all four majors simultaneously, having just resoundingly defeated young rival Nadal on clay entering the tournament. However, in {{a repeat of the}} previous year Federer played a tough four-set final against Nadal, but was undone by going 1/17 on break-point chances.|$|E

It is necessary to find technological and economically feasible alternatives for removing silica from bagasse before its gasification processing.|$|R
