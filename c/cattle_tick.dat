25|$|From the 1890s {{until the}} 1950s, the north Queensland beef cattle {{industry}} was hampered {{by a number}} of factors. The prevalence of <b>cattle</b> <b>tick</b> meant that dipping was required to control it, although some tick resistance in the cattle did occur. Markets fluctuated: for example, the World War I boom was followed by a collapse of the beef export trade in 1921 resulting in a long and serious depression until 1939. Additionally, during the interwar period, three new diseases in northern stock were recognised - buffalo fly, Pegleg (due to phosphate deficiency) and ephemeral fever. Drought and long dry seasons remained a problem for northern cattlemen. Markets improved again during World War II {{but it was not until}} 1953 that the herd numbers surpassed the 1894 level.|$|E
500|$|Banded sugar ants are omnivores {{and feed}} on sweet substances. They tend plant-eating insects such as aphids, and {{feed on the}} fluids they secrete. Honeydew {{secretions}} are produced from the anus of the aphid, which is later provided to the ants. This behaviour is mutually beneficial to both organisms, as the ants protect the aphids from predation and the aphids provides a nutritious liquid to the ants. Banded sugar ants also tend the larvae of the southern purple azure butterfly (Ogyris genoveva). They are visitors to flowers of Eucalyptus globulus trees, where they can act as pollinators. They may be [...] seen at night foraging under lights in urban areas for arthropod prey, such as termites and the southern <b>cattle</b> <b>tick</b> (Rhipicephalus microplus). During the night, banded sugar ants are known to [...] "rob" [...] food sources excreted by Hemiptera insects that are fed on by meat ants during the day. Banded sugar ants and meat ants tend to nest near one another, and areas where the two ants forage have shorter foraging periods due to interference between the species. However, banded sugar ants are nocturnal while meat ants are not, so foraging periods are extended by one or two hours if no interference occurs.|$|E
2500|$|Other ticks which {{commonly}} {{need to be}} differentiated from Ixodes holocyclus include Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Brown dog tick), Haemaphysalis longicornis (Bush tick) and Rhipicephalus microplus (<b>Cattle</b> <b>tick).</b>|$|E

2500|$|A <b>cattle</b> <b>tick</b> {{conference in}} May 1907, convened by the {{agricultural}} department, approved the motion [...] "that a bacteriologist {{be attached to}} the Department of Agriculture and Stock to investigate diseases in stock" [...] with mention of regaining the services of Pound. It was reported the government decided that while Pound was to continue supervising the institute's work on plague outbreaks and other human pathology, his attention should again be directed to livestock: tick fever, pleuropneumonia, lumpy jaw, swine fever, swamp cancer, sheep parasites, and poultry diseases. As a result, in August 1907 supervision and control of the institute were returned to the agricultural department.|$|E
2500|$|Three major {{structural}} {{changes in the}} beef cattle industry {{took place in the}} 1890s. The financial crisis of 1893, combined with low cattle prices and restricted markets, caused a change in the pattern of ownership, with many large stations passing to banks and pastoral finance companies. Secondly, a new type of owner was created: grazing selectors, initially given 30 year leases on areas not larger than 20,000 acres (subsequently increased to 60,000 acres). The third major change was the successful establishment of freezing plants in north Queensland, enabling cattle producers to enter the world market. Coinciding with these changes was the severe reduction in stock numbers from [...] due to <b>cattle</b> <b>tick,</b> which killed a third or more of the cattle herd, and from the drought of 1898-1902. Wairuna experienced a 50 per cent loss of stock from the disease in 1896 when it first broke out on the property.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Cattle</b> <b>tick,</b> (Rhipicephalus annulatus), is a hard-bodied tick of {{the genus}} Rhipicephalus. It {{is also known as}} North American <b>cattle</b> <b>tick,</b> North American Texas fever tick, and Texas fever tick.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, despite the drought of 1924 and {{problems}} with <b>cattle</b> <b>ticks,</b> pastoralists {{in the area}} continued to prosper {{with the opening of}} an abattoir in Wyndham and the establishment of a stock route from Wyndham to the central Kimberley.|$|R
50|$|Zebu cattle were {{imported}} from Pakistan in 1956 and Brahman cattle were also brought from United States at about that time. Many new breeds were developed from these imports and {{this led to}} cattle that were much more tolerant to the Top End heat and <b>cattle</b> <b>ticks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Adaptaur cattle are early {{maturing}} {{and of a}} medium size with a short dark red pigmented coat and good resistance to internal parasites. [...] Some Adaptaurs carry a gene that produces extremely high resistance to <b>cattle</b> <b>ticks</b> and the Australian Hereford Society is assisting to increase frequency of the gene by embryo transfer.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{survey the}} {{prevalence}} of <b>cattle</b> <b>ticks</b> in Nur County and prepare a list of tick fauna in this district. Methods: This investigation was carried out on 150 head of <b>cattle</b> <b>ticks</b> of rural areas of Nur city which is located in Mazandaran province during spring and summer seasons of 2011. The collected ticks were identified using light microscope and available systematic keys. Results: A total number of 1563 ticks were isolated from examined cattle and their genus and numbers including: Ixodes ricinus 51 % (111 male and 691 female) and Boophilus annulatus 49 % (83 male and 678 female), respectively. Conclusions: Results of the current investigation indicate the presence of two species of acarine ectoparasites which have potential health risk Ixodes ricinus and Boophilus annulatus. More studies are required to increase our data concerning ticks and other ectopreasites of ruminants {{in other areas of}} Mazandaran province and should be noted to their ability in transmission of infectious agents...|$|R

50|$|<b>Cattle</b> <b>tick</b> (Boophilus microplus) was {{probably}} introduced into Darwin with cattle from Indonesia {{in the early}} 1870s. The tick spread south into {{other parts of the}} continent and became a major problem for the cattle industry. In 1891 <b>cattle</b> <b>tick</b> reached Queensland bringing with it tick fever caused by three types of blood-born bacteria. By the mid-1890s the tick had spread quickly to the south causing heavy losses among herds. This heightened the need for stock inspection {{and by the end of}} the century there were more than 30 inspectors stationed at 28 locations throughout Queensland.|$|E
50|$|These ticks, {{commonly}} known as <b>cattle</b> <b>ticks</b> or blue ticks, have a highly characteristic morphology and one-host lifecycle. They are economically important to cattle rearing industry by causing direct parasitic losses and by transmission of microbes. In addition to Rhipicephalus microplus, species of most importance to domestic animals are R. annulatus, which is widespread in tropical and subtropical countries, and R. decoloratus which occurs in Africa.|$|R

40|$|The {{recombinant}} Bm 86 -based tick vaccines {{have shown}} their efficacy {{for the control}} of <b>cattle</b> <b>ticks,</b> Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus and R. annulatus infestations. However, <b>cattle</b> <b>ticks</b> often co-exist with multi-host ticks such as Hyalomma and Amblyomma species, thus requiring the control of multiple <b>tick</b> infestations for <b>cattle</b> and other hosts. Vaccination trials using a R. microplus recombinant Bm 86 -based vaccine were conducted in cattle and camels against Hyalomma dromedarii and in cattle against Amblyomma cajennense immature and adult ticks. The results showed an 89 % {{reduction in the number}} of H. dromedarii nymphs engorging on vaccinated cattle, and a further 32 % reduction in the weight of the surviving adult ticks. In vaccinated camels, a reduction of 27 % and 31 % of tick engorgement and egg mass weight, respectively was shown, while egg hatching was reduced by 39 %. However, cattle vaccination with Bm 86 did not have an effect on A. cajennense tick infestations. These results showed that Bm 86 vaccines are effective against R. microplus and other tick species but improved vaccines containing new antigens are required to control multiple tick infestations.
