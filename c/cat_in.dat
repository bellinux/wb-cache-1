5|$|In 2009, the Royal National Theatre {{created a}} stage {{version of the}} book, adapted and {{directed}} by Katie Mitchell. Seussical, a musical adaptation that incorporates aspects of many Dr. Seuss works, features the <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> the Hat as narrator. The musical received weak reviews when it opened, in November 2001, but eventually became a staple in regional and school theaters. The Cat also stars in the 1982 television film The Grinch Grinches the <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> the Hat and the 2010 animated television series The <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> the Hat Knows a Lot About That! A ride at Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure park in Orlando, Florida, is based around The <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> the Hat.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> the Hats {{popularity}} {{also led}} to increased popularity and exposure for Geisel's previous children's books. For example, 1940's Horton Hatches the Egg had sold 5,801 copies in its opening year and 1,645 the following year. In 1958, {{the year after the}} publication of The <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> the Hat, 27,643 copies of Horton were sold, and by 1960 the book had sold a total of over 200,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} as a girl named Sally and her unnamed brother, who serves as the narrator of the book, sit alone in their house on a cold, rainy day, staring wistfully out the window. Then they hear a loud bump which is quickly {{followed}} {{by the arrival of}} the <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> the Hat, a tall anthropomorphic <b>cat</b> <b>in</b> a red and white striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat proposes to entertain the children with some tricks that he knows. The children's pet fish refuses, insisting that the Cat leave. The Cat responds by balancing the fish on the tip of his umbrella. The game quickly becomes more complicated, as the Cat balances himself on a ball and tries to balance lots of household items on his limbs until he falls on his head, dropping everything he was holding. The fish admonishes him again, but the <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> the Hat just proposes another game.|$|E
5000|$|The Canadian Cat Association (Association Féline Canadienne, CCA-AFC) is a {{non-profit}} organization in Canada, whose mission is to [...] "promote the welfare of all <b>cats</b> <b>in</b> Canada", [...] "maintain a registry of pure-bred <b>cats</b> <b>in</b> Canada", and [...] "further the improvement of all breeds of <b>cats</b> <b>in</b> Canada". Although a small group, they are recognized {{around the world for}} the quality of their database.|$|R
50|$|The {{organization}} assists {{low income}} {{individuals and families}} {{with the cost of}} spaying and neutering their <b>cats.</b> <b>In</b> 2013, VOKRA sterilized 120 free-roaming <b>cats</b> <b>in</b> the Whalley neighbourhood of Surrey, with a grant from PetSmart Charities. In 2014, the organization received a grant to help low income <b>cat</b> guardians <b>in</b> the Newton neighbourhood of Surrey.|$|R
40|$|Cats with {{suspicion}} of {{feline leukemia virus}} (FeLV) infection are commonly tested for antigenemia by p 27 ELISA. However, many p 27 negative cats test FeLV provirus positive in the blood. So far, {{the risk of a}} FeLV transmission via provirus-positive blood has not been evaluated. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore this risk. Fifteen ten-week old specified pathogen free (SPF) kittens were randomly assigned to three groups: five cats (group A) received blood from a FeLV provirus positive cat, five cats (group B) were transfused with blood from a provirus and viral RNA positive cat and five control cats (group C) received SPF blood. All <b>cats</b> <b>in</b> groups A and B turned provirus and plasma viral RNA positive post transfusion. Moreover, all <b>cats</b> <b>in</b> group A, and three <b>cats</b> <b>in</b> group B became p 27 positive. All <b>cats</b> <b>in</b> group C stayed FeLV negative. Remarkably, <b>cats</b> <b>in</b> group A turned FeLV positive later than <b>cats</b> <b>in</b> group B but had a graver infection outcome (higher FeLV loads); two <b>cats</b> <b>in</b> group A became persistently infected. Our results demonstrate for the first time that FeLV infection can be transmitted via blood transfusion of blood from FeLV provirus positive, antigen negative cats to naïve recipients. Based on our results we highly recommend screening blood donors for FeLV provirus by PCR prior to blood transfusion...|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of Men in Black: Alien Attacks development, Universal Creative were {{installing}} two new dark ride systems at the neighbouring Islands of Adventure theme park. The first system was designed for The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man and was manufactured by Oceaneering International. It featured track-mounted motion bases with {{six degrees of freedom}} that were able to tour physical sets and allow riders to view 3D projections. The second system was developed by MTS Systems Corporation for The <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> the Hat. This system was simpler, offering track-mounted spinning platforms, with no additional degrees of freedom. The MIB design team initially intended to utilise the Spider-Man ride system; however, when shooting tests were performed on the ride, the vast motion of the vehicles made it impossible for riders to achieve a reasonable score. As a result, The <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> the Hat system was selected for the MIB attraction.|$|E
5|$|Geisel {{agreed to}} write The <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> the Hat {{at the request}} of William Spaulding of Houghton Mifflin; however, because Geisel was under {{contract}} with Random House, the head of Random House, Bennett Cerf, made a deal with Houghton Mifflin. Random House retained the rights to trade sales, which encompassed copies of the book sold at book stores, while Houghton Mifflin retained the education rights, which encompassed copies sold to schools.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> the Hat {{has been}} adapted for various media, {{including}} theater, television, film, and educational software. The animated musical TV special premiered in 1971 and starred Allan Sherman as the <b>Cat.</b> <b>In</b> 2003, a live-action film adaptation was released, starring Mike Myers as the Cat, Spencer Breslin as Conrad, and Dakota Fanning as Sally. Boxoffice.com {{reports that the}} film grossed $133,960,541 worldwide on an estimated $165 million budget. In 2012, following the financial success of The Lorax, the animated film adaptation of the Dr. Seuss book of the same name, Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment announced plans to produce a CGI adaptation of the book. Rob Lieber will write the script, Chris Meledandri will produce, and Audrey Geisel will be the executive producer.|$|E

5|$|The {{distribution}} of jungle cat is largely oriental; {{it occurs in}} the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, central and southeastern Asia, Sri Lanka and in southern China. It {{is the most common}} small wild <b>cat</b> <b>in</b> India. Thought to be absent from south of the Isthmus of Kra in the Malayan peninsula, the possibility of its occurrence was reported from a highly fragmented forest in the Malaysian state of Selangor in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{jungle cat}} is a habitat generalist; it inhabits places with {{adequate}} water and dense vegetation, such as swamps, wetlands and riparian areas. Despite its name, the jungle cat shuns rainforests and woodlands. The jungle cat {{is listed as}} Least Concern on the IUCN Red List and is mainly threatened by destruction of wetlands, trapping and poisoning. The status of the <b>cat</b> <b>in</b> the wild needs further study, though populations {{are thought to be}} declining.|$|E
5|$|Dewey's {{obituary}} ran in over 270 {{national and}} international newspapers and his death was announced on Japanese television. A public memorial service was held in December 2006 and his cremated remains were buried outside of the library. Despite numerous offers, the library placed a two-year moratorium on getting a new <b>cat.</b> <b>In</b> January 2009, the library board voted to have a permanent prohibition against any other cats or pets at the library, to avoid problems for patrons with allergies.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the closure}} of the Black <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> 1964, Sarria went to work with restaurateur Pierre Parker. The pair {{operated}} French restaurants at World's Fairs. While at the 1964 New York World's Fair, Sarria learned that Jimmy Moore had committed suicide. Sarria worked at several more Fairs before retiring in 1974. After living with Parker in Phoenix, Arizona for several years, Sarria returned to San Francisco. He continued to reign over the Courts for 43years, before abdicating in 2007. For his lifetime of activism, the city of San Francisco renamed a section of 16th Street in Sarria's honor.|$|E
5|$|For {{the main}} villain in the film, Maximillian Largo, Connery {{suggested}} Klaus Maria Brandauer, {{the lead of}} the 1981 Academy Award-winning Hungarian film Mephisto. Through the same route came Max von Sydow as Ernst Stavro Blofeld, although he still retained his Eon-originated white <b>cat</b> <b>in</b> the film. For the femme fatale, director Irvin Kershner selected former model and Playboy cover girl Barbara Carrera to play Fatima Blush – the name coming from one of the early scripts of Thunderball. Carrera's performance as Fatima Blush earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, which she lost to Cher for her role in Silkwood.|$|E

5|$|Julien (Radziwilowicz) is {{a middle-aged}} clockmaker who lives {{alone with his}} <b>cat</b> <b>in</b> a large house in the Paris suburbs. Julien is blackmailing 'Madame X' (Brochet) who is {{importing}} fake antique Chinese silks, and may have murdered her sister. By chance, he meets Marie (Béart), {{a beautiful young woman}} he last saw a year ago, and they begin a passionate relationship. Though elusive, Marie agrees to move in with him; she acts strangely at times and appears absent. A mystery connects Marie to Madame X's dead sister and in uncovering Marie's secret Julien risks losing her. The film is separated into four parts, named to reflect the narrative perspective.|$|E
5|$|Rehearsals {{were held}} {{six days a}} week at the Pushkin Theatre, usually from 10am to 1pm. They were {{frequently}} interrupted by air-raid sirens, and some musicians were required to undertake anti-aircraft or firefighting duties. To enable them to attend rehearsals, performers were granted orchestral ID cards to show at checkpoints. Members of the military orchestra (and some ordinary troops) were dispatched to the rehearsals to supplement the performers. Rehearsals were moved to the Philharmonia Hall in June, and in late July were increased to 5–6 hours a day. Instruments were in poor condition and few repairmen were available; one oboist was asked for a <b>cat</b> <b>in</b> exchange for a repair, as the starving repairman had already eaten several.|$|E
5|$|Together, the Clan cats {{succeed in}} leading Sharptooth {{into a trap}} in a cave. However, their plan to poison Sharptooth goes awry, and Feathertail jumps {{up to the roof}} of the cave onto a stalactite, causing it to fall. Both Feathertail and Sharptooth are killed by the impact. The Tribe then realizes that Feathertail was the silver <b>cat</b> <b>in</b> their prophecy, not her brother Stormfur, as they had {{previously}} thought. The five remaining cats then continue their journey. The book ends with Squirrelpaw noticing Highstones, which is at the edge of WindClan territory; they are almost home.|$|E

5|$|Although wildcats are solitary, {{the social}} {{behavior}} of domestic cats {{is much more}} variable and ranges from widely dispersed individuals to feral cat colonies that form around a food source, based on groups of co-operating females. Within such groups, one cat is usually dominant over the others. Each <b>cat</b> <b>in</b> a colony holds a distinct territory, with sexually active males having the largest territories, which are about 10 times larger than those of female cats and may overlap with several females' territories. These territories are marked by urine spraying, by rubbing objects at head height with secretions from facial glands, and by defecation. Between these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts. Outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and growling, and if that does not work, by short but noisy and violent attacks. Despite some cats cohabiting in colonies, {{they do not have}} a social survival strategy, or a pack mentality, and always hunt alone.|$|E
5|$|Amy has non-playable {{roles in}} a number of other game plots. Her {{attraction}} to Sonic is useful to Cream and Blaze the <b>Cat</b> <b>in</b> Sonic Rush, since they are also looking for him. In Shadow the Hedgehog, Amy appears at Cryptic Castle to ask him to help her find Cream, who has not returned. In the game's final story, unlocked after the player reaches the rest of the endings, Amy admiringly cheers Shadow on. In the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog game, she mistakes Silver the Hedgehog for Sonic; when he tells her he is looking for someone, she insists on helping him. When Silver attacks Sonic, Amy finds them and blocks Silver's way (saving Sonic's life); he escapes, and Amy yells at Silver. She rescues Elise (who also likes Sonic, although Amy does not know this at the time) from confinement. In Sonic Lost World, Amy and Knuckles care for forest animals while Sonic and Tails rescue the animals' friends. The Deadly Six (the game's antagonists) control one of Eggman's machines to drain life from the world; Amy and Knuckles die, but are brought back to life when Sonic and Tails replenish it.|$|E
