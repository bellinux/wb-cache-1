Vigilance decrement is most commonly associated with monitoring to detect a weak target signal. Detection performance loss is less likely to occur in cases where the target signal exhibits a high saliency.

50|$|Marius Sudol, PhD, is an American {{molecular}} {{and cellular}} biologist. He {{was born in}} 1954 in Tarnow, Poland. In 1978, he immigrated to the United States to study at The Rockefeller University in New York City. Among his most significant achievements to date are the identification of a modular protein domain, known as the WW domain, and the characterization of its cognate ligands. In 2004, together with a research team at AxCell-Cytogen company, Marius Sudol reported the first comprehensive protein interaction map for a human modular domain. Today, the WW domain is known to mediate <b>critical</b> <b>signals</b> in tumor suppressor networks, including the Hippo signaling pathway. More importantly, syndromes such as the Golabi-Ito-Hall syndrome of intellectual disability and Liddle syndrome of hypertension are caused by loss-of-function point mutations in the WW domain or its cognate ligands.|$|E
50|$|Cell {{attachment}} to the ECM is a basic requirement to build a multicellular organism. Integrins are not simply hooks, but give the cell <b>critical</b> <b>signals</b> {{about the nature of}} its surroundings. Together with signals arising from receptors for soluble growth factors like VEGF, EGF, and many others, they enforce a cellular decision on what biological action to take, be it attachment, movement, death, or differentiation. Thus integrins {{lie at the heart of}} many cellular biological processes. The attachment of the cell takes place through formation of cell adhesion complexes, which consist of integrins and many cytoplasmic proteins, such as talin, vinculin, paxillin, and alpha-actinin. These act by regulating kinases such as FAK (focal adhesion kinase) and Src kinase family members to phosphorylate substrates such as p130CAS thereby recruiting signaling adaptors such as CRK. These adhesion complexes attach to the actin cytoskeleton. The integrins thus serve to link two networks across the plasma membrane: the extracellular ECM and the intracellular actin filamentous system. Integrin α6β4 is an exception: it links to the keratin intermediate filament system in epithelial cells.|$|E

40|$|This chapter investigates some {{restructuring}} techniques {{based on}} decomposition and factorization, {{with the objective}} to move <b>critical</b> <b>signals</b> toward the output while minimizing area. A specific application is synthesis for minimum switching activity (or high performance), with minimum area penalty, where decompositions with respect to specific critical variables are needed (the ones of highest switching activity for example). In {{order to reduce the}} power consumption of the circuit, the number of gates that are affected by the switching activity of <b>critical</b> <b>signals</b> is maintained constant. The chapter describes new types of factorization that extend Shannon cofactoring and are based on projection functions that change the Hamming distance among the original minterms to favor logic minimization of the component blocks. Moreover, the proposed algorithms generate and exploit don't care conditions in order to further minimize the final circuit.

40|$|Sixty-one {{participants}} {{performed a}} sustained attention task {{in which they}} were required to respond to a <b>critical</b> <b>signal</b> requiring feature discrimination. Three separate groups performed the task with different global display configurations. The local feature elements (directional arrow shapes) were dis- played on either a circle, a circle broken apart or a reconnected figure. For two of the groups, the entire display consisted of a clear global shape (circle and reconnected), and for one of the groups, the display had no discernible global element (bro- ken circle) despite the <b>critical</b> <b>signal</b> being the same for all the groups. Analyses of hit rate and A′ scores indicated that the broken circle group had impaired performance compared to the global figure groups. A configural superiority effect was found in which performance was improved by having a global shape property to the entire display. These results provide a behavioural base for further research utilizing measures of cerebral activation, as cerebral activity during vigilance tasks may be dependent on both task difficulty and hierarchical aspects of the display. The configurable or hierarchical aspects of vigilance displays may be critical in understanding sustained attention performance and its hemispheric lateralization...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a technique to}} optimize the speed performance of circuits implemented in FPGAs. After synthesis, technology mapping and placement are complete, we apply Shannon’s expansion to the most critical sections of the circuit. This approach allows us to precompute the values of functions that depend on late-arriving <b>critical</b> <b>signals</b> and use a multiplexer to quickly select the appropriate value when the signal arrives. Any new logic elements created by this technique are incrementally placed in a minimally disruptive fashion to ensure convergence between the circuit optimization and the netlist placement. Experimental results show that this technique can improve the performance of circuits by 11 % on average, and up to 30 % in some cases. I...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that Network on-chip (NoC) is superior to a bus in terms of power and area for given traffic throughput requirements. Consequently, NoC {{is expected to be the}} main interconnect infrastructure in future System on Chip (SoC) and chip multi-processor (CMP). Unlike off-chip networks, VLSI modules are only a few millimeters apart, hence the cost of off-network communication among the network end-points and routers is quite low. Such off-network communication can circumvent weaknesses of the NoC, such as latency of <b>critical</b> <b>signals,</b> complexity and cost of broadcast operations, and operations requiring global knowledge or central control.

RANK−/− mice also exhibited a marked deficiency of B cells in the spleen. RANK−/− mice retained mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues including Peyer’s patches but completely lacked all other peripheral lymph nodes, highlighting an additional major role for RANK in lymph node formation.
