5|$|Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann: Governor Swann's {{daughter}} and Will's love interest; Swann is {{taken by the}} pirate crew of the Black Pearl. Knightley <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to Verbinski; {{he had not seen}} her performance in Bend It Like Beckham and was impressed by her audition.|$|E
5|$|According to plan, the Syrians {{attacked}} {{from the}} southern Golan Heights, {{just south of the}} Sea of Galilee through al-Hama and the Yarmouk River, hitting a densely populated Jewish area of settlement. This <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to the Haganah, which expected an attack from south Lebanon and Mishmar HaYarden. The Jewish villages on the original confrontation line were Ein Gev, Masada, Sha'ar HaGolan and both Deganias.|$|E
5|$|Pre-election public-opinion polls {{had promised}} victory to the communists. Thus the total {{defeat of the}} PZPR and its {{satellite}} parties <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to all involved: {{after the first round}} of elections, it became evident that Solidarity had fared extremely well, capturing 160 of 161 contested Sejm seats, and 92 of 100 Senate seats. After the second round, it had won virtually every seat—all 161 in the Sejm, and 99 in the Senate.|$|E
5000|$|Mala Subotica {{is famous}} for its {{developed}} underground music scene, which <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> since the village has population of just 2,000 people.|$|R
50|$|Leslie {{had little}} trouble against the 6-5 Riley, scoring 14 points on 7-of-11 {{shooting}} in the first half. The success did not <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to her.|$|R
25|$|MCC missed chances innumerable, and, {{looking back}} over one's cuttings, it <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to read how poor the English fielding, and {{especially}} the catching, was on this tour.|$|R
5|$|The {{album was}} not commercially acclaimed, which <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to Sire {{since they had}} insisted the band record with Gouldman {{in an effort to}} {{increase}} fan-base; it peaked at number fifty-eight on the Billboard 200 and only charted outside of the US in Sweden. The album was not critically acclaimed either, as it received several mixed articles by reviewers, who insisted the album to be less playable than their first four albums.|$|E
5|$|Further {{attacks were}} {{conducted}} against Saipan during late November {{in an attempt}} to disrupt the American offensive. On November24, Marianas-based B-29s conducted their first raid against Japan, bombing targets in and around Tokyo. Three days later the Japanese mounted two raids against their bases. During the early hours of November27, two G4Ms flying from Iwo Jima struck Isley Field from low altitude and escaped after destroying one B-29 and damaging eleven others. This attack <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to the Americans, and construction lights were still on at Isley {{at the start of the}} raid.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Russian {{declaration}} of war <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to both Carol and Kogălniceanu, {{who had not been}} informed of the exact date (April 23) when the Imperial Russian Army would start moving into Moldavia—hence, Romanians tended to regard it as an invasion. Also alarming for Kogălniceanu, the official Russian proclamation addressed Romanians as protegés of the Empire. Bilateral tensions were somewhat alleviated by Russian apologies and, later, by the Ottoman pledge to annex Romania; addressing a discontented Parliament, Kogălniceanu asserted that the Russian road was the country's only choice.|$|E
30|$|In {{spite of}} its infiltrating character, the {{granular}} cell tumor within the breast is a benign lesion. It is curable by simple excision [4]. The exact histological diagnosis usually <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise.</b>|$|R

25|$|Given the radically {{different}} motivating assumptions, it may <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> that ESSes and Nash equilibria often coincide. In fact, every ESS {{corresponds to a}} Nash equilibrium, but some Nash equilibria are not ESSes.|$|R
5|$|Scalia took a broad {{view of the}} Eleventh Amendment, which bars certain {{lawsuits}} against states in the federal courts. In his 1989 dissent in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., Scalia stated {{that there was no}} intent {{on the part of the}} framers to have the states surrender any sovereign immunity and that the case that provoked the Eleventh Amendment, Chisholm v. Georgia, <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to them. Professor Ralph Rossum, who wrote a survey of Scalia's constitutional views, suggests that the justice's view of the Eleventh Amendment was actually contradictory to the language of the Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian {{government}} {{refused to}} yield, and Christie issued orders for British warships to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity. Brazil {{prepared for what}} {{was seen as an}} imminent conflict. PedroII was the main reason for Brazil's resistance; he rejected any suggestion of yielding. This response <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to Christie, who changed his tenor and proposed a peaceful settlement through international arbitration. The Brazilian government presented its demands and, upon seeing the British government's position weaken, severed diplomatic ties with Britain in June 1863.|$|E
5|$|The McLaughlin Planetarium {{was closed}} on November 5, 1995. The {{president}} of the ROM stated that {{the closure of the}} planetarium was due to a combination of falling attendance and a declining interest in space, and that the closure was necessitated by provincial budget cuts. The decision <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to many, as attendance had rebounded in recent years, and the planetarium was one of few in North America at the time that was turning a profit. The closure meant that 40 people lost their jobs.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his fifth}} Stanley Cup win, with Toronto, the New York Rangers claimed Olmstead in the Intra-League Draft on June 4, 1962. This <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to Olmstead, {{who refused to}} report to the team. The Canadiens offered to acquire him from the Rangers, within a month; Olmstead demanded an {{immediate}} trade. Since no deal came, he retired at the age of 35. During his 14-year NHL career, Olmstead scored 181goals and 421assists, for 602points; in the playoffs, he collected 59points, in 115games. In his 14seasons, Olmstead appeared in the Stanley Cup final 11times. He won five times, four of them with the Montreal Canadiens, and once with the Toronto Maple Leafs.|$|E
5|$|On 16 August 2007, Odex {{initiated}} {{legal action}} against a third Internet Service Provider, Pacific Internet. Odex sought to have Pacific Internet disclose the personal information of about 1,000 subscribers. The closed-door hearing was held on 23 August 2007 in the Subordinate Courts, where District Judge Earnest Lau ruled that Pacific Internet {{did not have to}} reveal its subscribers' personal information. Lau believed that Odex was not the correct party to make the application, despite having permission to prosecute on behalf of the Japanese anime studios. The decision <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to many, and Odex quickly announced its intent to appeal. Although Lau denied Odex the court order, he warned that the right to privacy was no defence for copyright infringement.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer's deft {{handling}} of the July conference impressed his colleagues; his insight and ability to handle even the most difficult people <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> even to {{those who knew him}} well. In the wake of the conference, Oppenheimer saw that while they had {{come to grips with the}} physics, considerable work was still required on the engineering, chemistry, metallurgy and ordnance aspects of building an atomic bomb. He became convinced that bomb design would require an environment where people could freely discuss problems and thereby reduce wasteful duplication of effort. He reasoned that this could best be reconciled with security by creating a central laboratory in an isolated location.|$|E
50|$|Upon winning her seat, Alcantara {{announced}} that she would join the Republican-aligned Independent Democratic Conference, which did not <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to many, considering Independent Democratic Leader Jeff Klein had assisted Alcantara considerably in her primary election campaign.|$|R
25|$|These factors often <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to many {{students}} in the preclinical years, who often {{work very hard to}} get great grades, but do not realize that only 45% of directors cite basic science performance <b>as</b> <b>an</b> important measure.|$|R
5|$|Egypt in 2015 {{reportedly}} {{expressed an}} interest again in the JF-17 despite buying French and Russian planes earlier that year. This has <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to analysts who had considered the possibility of Egypt acquiring the JF-17 to be lost.|$|R
5|$|The Saints {{received}} Campbell {{in exchange}} for their first round draft pick in 1985, with which Houston selected cornerback Richard Johnson. The trade <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> in New Orleans; the team already had the young George Rogers, the 1981 No. 1 overall draft pick and that year's Rookie of the Year and rushing champion. With Campbell and Rogers, the Saints now had two Heisman Trophy winners in the backfield. In his first game with New Orleans, Campbell carried five times for 19 yards, and continued to have a diminished role in the offense {{throughout the rest of the}} season. He rushed for a total of 468 yards and four touchdowns in 1984, and failed to record a 100-yard game during the season.|$|E
5|$|The {{announcement}} that Portal 2 {{would be available}} on PlayStation 3 <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to the industry because Gabe Newell had criticized that console in the past, citing difficulties in the port of The Orange Box. The move toward the PlayStation 3 {{was a result of}} growing frustration with Microsoft's policies for Xbox 360 content, including the difficulty of pushing patching and new content to players. Newell saw Sony's publication model as more open, allowing Steam-like features to be used on the console. Portal 2 was the first PlayStation 3 game to support a subset of features from Steamworks, including automatic updates, downloadable content, and community support. The game supports cross-platform play between the PlayStation 3, Windows, and OS X versions.|$|E
5|$|The first raids <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> {{and were}} met by {{ineffective}} responses. On the first raid a Beaufighter from 604 Squadron shot down a single bomber, while the next three raids resulted in no kills, and the next a single kill again. But as {{the pattern of the}} attacks grew more obvious—short attacks against smaller coastal cities—the defense responded. Four bombers were shot down on the night of 3/4 May, two more on 7/8th, one on 18th, two on the 23rd. The Luftwaffe changed their tactics as well; their bombers would approach at low altitude, climb to spot the target, and then dive again after releasing their bombs. This meant that interceptions with the Mk. IV were possible only during the bomb run.|$|E
50|$|Nothing is as {{it seems}} {{and it turns out}} to be a good whodunit mystery with Dev Anand on the run from law to prove his innocence. The {{identity}} of the real villain remains a mystery and the climax <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise.</b>|$|R

5|$|The offer, {{representing}} a 46 percent premium over the stocks selling price at the time, <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to Burger King CEO John Chidsey. The proposed sale {{was expected to}} help the company repair its fundamental business structures and continue working {{to close the gap}} with McDonald's. Analysts commenting on the transaction stated that 3G will have to invest heavily in the company to help reverse its fortunes. David Palmer from UBS stated the company will need to work with its large group of franchise owners to brighten its locations and stabilize sales which could take several years and require significant reinvestment, while Steve West of Stifel Nicolaus stated that Burger King will need at least a year to right its fundamentals.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 28 January, the Coalition {{received}} {{a number of}} warnings suggesting an impending Iraqi offensive. The Coalition was flying two brand-new E-8A Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) aircraft, which picked up the deployment and movement of Iraqi forces to the area opposite of Khafji. Observation posts 2, 7 and 8 also detected heavy Iraqi reconnoitering along the border, and their small teams of air-naval gunfire liaison Marines called in air and artillery strikes throughout the day. Lieutenant Colonel Richard Barry, commander of the forward headquarters of the 1st Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Intelligence Group, sent warnings about an impending attack to Central Command. CentCom leaders were too preoccupied with the air campaign to heed them however, and so the Iraqi operation <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise.</b>|$|E
5|$|Banks {{was given}} his first team debut by manager Doug Livingstone, {{at the expense}} of long-serving Ron Powell, in a Third Division game against Colchester United at Saltergate in November 1958. The game ended 2–2, and Banks kept his place against Norwich City in the {{following}} match; {{by the end of the}} 1958–59 season he had missed only three games, those owing to injury. With no goalkeeping coaching to speak of, Banks had to learn from his mistakes on the pitch, and he soon developed into a modern vocal goalkeeper who ordered the players in front of him into a more effective defence. Having just 23 league and three cup appearances to his name, it <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to Banks when Matt Gillies, manager of First Division club Leicester City, bought him from Chesterfield for £7,000 in July 1959; this also meant a wage increase to £15 a week.|$|E
