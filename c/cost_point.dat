Digital Object Identifier: 10. 1109 /PES. 2007. 386289 The task of monitoring asset status and optimizing asset utilization for the T&D industry, given millions of assets {{and hundreds of thousands of}} miles of power lines distributed geographically over millions of square miles, seems particularly challenging if not impossible. Given the traditionally high cost of sensing and communications, the grid has minimal ‘smarts’ with much of the intelligence located at major substations. Dramatic reductions in sensor, computing and communications costs, coupled with significant performance enhancements has raised the possibility of realizing widely and massively distributed sensor networks (SNs) to monitor utility asset status. Under NEETRAC funding, a survey was conducted to review existing sensor technologies and products, and to estimate the possibility of extending these to realize distributed SNs. Possible applications for such SNs were also explored, as was the issue of <b>cost</b> <b>point</b> at which such networks would become commercially viable. This paper provides an overview of the highlights from the detailed survey that was conducted, and identifies ‘gaps’ in currently available sensor technologies, both from a performance and <b>cost</b> <b>point...</b>|$|E
