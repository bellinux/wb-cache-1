40|$|Abstract—Cascades are {{ubiquitous}} in various network en-vironments. How to predict these cascades is highly nontrivial in several vital applications, such as viral marketing, epidemic prevention and traffic management. Most previous works mainly focus on predicting the final cascade sizes. As cascades are typical dynamic processes, {{it is always}} interesting and important to predict the cascade size at any time, or predict the time when a cascade will reach a certain size (e. g. an threshold for outbreak). In this paper, we unify all these tasks into a fundamental problem: <b>cascading</b> <b>process</b> prediction. That is, given the early stage of a cascade, how to predict its cumulative cascade size of any later time? For such a challenging problem, how to understand the micro mechanism that drives and generates the macro phenomena (i. e. <b>cascading</b> <b>process)</b> is essential. Here we introduce behavioral dynamics as the micro mechanism to describe the dynamic process of a node’s neighbors getting infected by a cascade after this node getting infected (i. e. one-hop subcascades). Through data-driven analysis, we find out the common principles and patterns lying in behavioral dynamics and propose a novel Networked Weibull Regression model for behavioral dynamics modeling. After that we propose a novel method for predicting <b>cascading</b> <b>processes</b> by effectively aggregating behavioral dynam-ics, and present a scalable solution to approximate the <b>cascading</b> <b>process</b> with a theoretical guarantee. We extensively evaluate the proposed method {{on a large scale}} social network dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art baselines in multiple tasks including cascade size prediction, outbreak time prediction and <b>cascading</b> <b>process</b> prediction...|$|R

50|$|While it is cost {{effective}} to liquefy natural gas for storage, transport, and use, roughly 10 to 15 {{percent of the}} gas gets consumed during the process. The optimal process contains four stages of propane refrigeration and two stages of ethylene refrigeration.

40|$|A recent {{experiment}} {{has shown}} that a tangle of quantized vortices in superfluid $^ 4 $He decayed even at mK temperatures where the normal fluid was negligible and no mutual friction worked. Motivated by this experiment, this work studies numerically {{the dynamics of the}} vortex tangle without the mutual friction, thus showing that a self-similar <b>cascade</b> <b>process,</b> whereby large vortex loops break up to smaller ones, proceeds in the vortex tangle and is closely related with its free decay. This <b>cascade</b> <b>process</b> which may be covered with the mutual friction at higher temperatures is just the one at zero temperature Feynman proposed long ago. The full Biot-Savart calculation is made for dilute vortices, while the localized induction approximation is used for a dense tangle. The former finds the elementary scenario: the reconnection of the vortices excites vortex waves along them and makes them kinked, which could be suppressed if the mutual friction worked. The kinked parts reconnect with the vortex they belong to, dividing into small loops. The latter simulation under the localized induction approximation shows that such <b>cascade</b> <b>process</b> actually proceeds self-similarly in a dense tangle and continues to make small vortices. Considering that the vortices of the interatomic size no longer keep the picture of vortex, the <b>cascade</b> <b>process</b> leads to the decay of the vortex line density.
