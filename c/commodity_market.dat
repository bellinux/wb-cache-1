5|$|In 1923 Greenfield moved Reid {{out of both}} of his {{portfolios}} {{and made}} him Provincial Treasurer, where he perpetuated his fiscal conservatism across the government. Early in his tenure, he presented a brief to cabinet recommending that ministers reduce their budgets {{and that the government}} create a purchasing department tasked with coordinating spending on supplies. In these proposals he found a close ally in Brownlee, Greenfield's Attorney-General, and when Brownlee succeeded Greenfield as Premier in 1925 he kept Reid as Provincial Treasurer and re-appointed him as Minister of Municipal Affairs. Brownlee and Reid had a history of working closely not only on fiscal issues, but also on agricultural ones: in July 1923, they had travelled together to investigate the creation of a wheat pool in Alberta. This trip included a meeting with cooperative pioneer Aaron Sapiro in San Francisco and a visit to Chicago's <b>commodity</b> <b>market.</b> Both Reid and Brownlee concluded that a pool ought to be proceeded with cautiously, if at all, though this view was overruled when a later visit by Sapiro to Alberta generated sufficient enthusiasm that the government {{had little choice but to}} go along with the creation of the Alberta Wheat Pool.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Analysis of reasons, {{correlations}} {{and consequences}} following {{from the impact}} that financial investors have on <b>commodity</b> <b>markets</b> – {{both before and after}} the crisis. Methodology: The research on the tremendous impact that the financial sector exerts on price formation in <b>commodity</b> <b>markets,</b> defined as the financialization of <b>commodity</b> <b>markets,</b> was based on a narrative approach. This approach makes use of available historical documents and attempts to reconstruct factors causing structural changes in <b>commodity</b> <b>markets.</b> As a result of these factors, <b>commodity</b> and financial <b>markets</b> (and particularly capital market) have become similar to a great extent. Findings: Drawing upon the research, it can be stated that the global financial crisis has contributed not only to a major change in the involvement of investors in <b>commodity</b> <b>markets,</b> but also to a structural change of this involvement, which is accompanied by a number of negative consequences. Originality: The research enables to draw certain conclusions, e. g. that the financialization of <b>commodity</b> <b>markets</b> is reflected in a radical price fluctuation in these markets due to which the prices are isolated from fair value.

Overbanked conditions existed which pressured struggling banking locations to increase their services (specifically to the agricultural customers) without any additional regulatory oversight or qualifications. This dilemma introduced several high risk and marginal business returns to the banking market. Banking growth would continue through the first two decades well outside of previous trends disregarding the current economic and population standards. Banking profitability and loan standards begin to deteriorate as early as 1900 as a result; adding to the agriculture shock and Great Depression to follow.|$|E
