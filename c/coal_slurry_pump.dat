40|$|This report {{marks the}} fourth quarter of the third phase of the {{centrifugal}} <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> improvement program. The program was begun in 1982 to improve the operating life of centrifugal <b>slurry</b> <b>pumps</b> for <b>coal</b> liquefaction service. The first phase reviewed pilot plant experience with centrifugal <b>slurry</b> <b>pumps</b> and identified, {{with the help of a}} literature search, the critical design parameters and materials required for such improvement. The second phase encompassed extensive small-scale testing of several hydraulic design concepts and materials testing and selection - the results being incorporated in a prototype <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> design. This third phase of the work has included i) prototype <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> testing against a state-of-the-art <b>coal</b> liquefaction <b>slurry</b> <b>pump,</b> wherein substantial reduction of wear was obtained at 60 % higher speed at the same head and flow rate therefore at 60 % higher specific speed - and ii) an investigation as to whether still higher specific speed is possible. The prototype pump tested in (i) had a specific speed of 600. Another pump of this same design was re-fitted for investigation (ii) with a smaller impeller and associated liners so as to operate at a specific speed of 1000. Both the 600 and the 1000 impellers for this latter investigation (ii) were made of mild carbon steel to accelerate the testing time. The two pumps were run in series in the slurry test loop using AS {number_sign} 110 sand ({approximately} 110 mesh) at a concentration of 30 % by weight in water at 80 {degrees}F. As previously reported, 24 hours of test time revealed a slightly lower overall wear rate for the 1000 -specific-speed pump; however, excessive local wear occurred in the impeller eye area of that pump. This was attributed to too large a clearance between the pump-out vanes and the suction side of the volute liner. Wear elsewhere in the pump was uniform and comparable to that of the 600 -specific-speed prototype pump. 3 figs., 2 tabs...|$|R

The 1. 5 {{generation}} hyperbranched molecule was synthesized with dehydroabietylamine as {{the core}} by means of Michael addition reaction and amidation condensation reaction with ethylenediamine and methyl acrylate as raws by divergent method.

The structure of products were identified by IR spectra and 1 HNMR spectra. The influences of dispersant on apparent viscosity，rheological behaviour and static stability of <b>coal</b> water <b>slurry</b> prepared from Shenfu coal are studied. The results showed that as the slurry concentration reach at 67 % the dosage of the dispersant was 0. 4 % (m/m), the viscosity of the <b>coal</b> water <b>slurry</b> was only at 987 mPa·s.

The program was begun in 1982 for the purpose of improving the operating life of centrifugal <b>slurry</b> <b>pumps</b> for <b>coal</b> liquefaction service. This phase of work will verify the design of a pump at higher speed operation. Eventual scale-up of the prototype <b>slurry</b> <b>pumps</b> to full-scale synthetic fuel generation plants could require ten times the flow. The higher speed will allow pumps to be smaller with respectable efficiencies. Conversely, without increasing the specific speed of the pump design, the eventual size would be more than triple that of the prototype <b>slurry</b> <b>pump.</b> The prototype <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> during this phase of the program incorporated all the features proven in the earlier phases of the program. This new, higher specific speed pump will be tested for the ability of the hydraulic design to inhibit wear. It will be tested and compared to the previous optimum prototype <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> of this program...|$|R
40|$|<b>Slurry</b> <b>pumps,</b> such as {{oil sand}} pumps, are widely used in {{industry}} to convert electrical energy to slurry potential and kinetic energy. Because of adverse working conditions, <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> impellers are prone to suffer wear, which may result in <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> breakdowns. To prevent any unexpected breakdowns, <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> impeller performance degradation assessment should be immediately conducted to monitor the current health condition and {{to ensure the safety}} and reliability of <b>slurry</b> <b>pumps.</b> In this paper, to provide an alternative to the impeller health indicator, an enhanced factor analysis based impeller indicator (EFABII) is proposed. Firstly, a low-pass filter is employed to improve the signal to noise ratios of <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> vibration signals. Secondly, redundant statistical features are extracted from the filtered vibration signals. To reduce the redundancy of the statistic features, the enhanced factor analysis is performed to generate new statistical features. Moreover, the statistic features can be automatically grouped and developed a new indicator called EFABII. Data collected from industrial oil sand pumps are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method is able to track the current health condition of <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> impellers...|$|R

40|$|Tank 50 H is {{the feed}} tank for the Saltstone Production Facility (SPF). At present, Tank 50 H {{contains}} two standard <b>slurry</b> <b>pumps</b> and two Quad Volute <b>slurry</b> <b>pumps.</b> Current requirements and mixing operation {{is to run}} three pumps for one hour prior to initiating a feed transfer to SPF. Savannah River Site (SRS) Liquid Waste would like to move {{one or both of}} the Quad Volute pumps from Tank 50 H to Tank 51 H to replace pumps in Tank 51 H that are failing. In addition, one of the standard pumps in Tank 50 H exhibits high seal leakage and vibration. SRS Liquid Waste requested Savannah River National (SRNL) to conduct a study to evaluate the feasibility of mixing the contents of Tank 50 H with one to three standard <b>slurry</b> <b>pumps.</b> To determine the pump requirements to blend miscible and immiscible liquids in Tank 50 H, the author reviewed the pilot-scale blending work performed for the Salt Disposition Integration Project (SDIP) and the technical literature, and applied the results to Tank 50 H to determine the number, size, and operating parameters needed to blend the tank contents. The conclusions from this analysis are: (1) A single rotating standard <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> (with a 13. 6 ft{sup 2 }/s U{sub 0 }D) will be able to blend miscible liquids (i. e., salt solution) in Tank 50 H within 4. 4 hours. (2) Two rotating standard <b>slurry</b> <b>pumps</b> will be able to blend miscible liquids in Tank 50 H within 3. 1 hours. (3) Three rotating standard <b>slurry</b> <b>pumps</b> will be able to blend miscible liquids in Tank 50 H within 2. 5 hours. (4) A single rotating standard <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> (with a 13. 6 ft{sup 2 }/s U{sub 0 }D) will disperse Isopar L{reg_sign} droplets that are less than or equal to 15 micron in diameter. If the droplets are less than 15 micron, they will be dispersed within 4. 4 hours. Isopar L{reg_sign} provides a lower bound on the maximum size of droplets that will be dispersed by the <b>slurry</b> <b>pumps</b> in Tank 50 H. (5) Two rotating standard <b>slurry</b> <b>pumps</b> will disperse Isopar L{reg_sign} droplets less than 15 micron within 3. 1 hours, and three rotating standard <b>slurry</b> <b>pumps</b> will disperse Isopar L{reg_sign} droplets less than 15 micron within 2. 5 hours.

40|$|Lecturepg. 35 Two {{significant}} problems are commonly identified when <b>slurry</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are used in}} process industries: sizing the pump to satisfactorily suit the service conditions and selecting the appropriate wear resistant materials to provide optimum part life.

40|$|The {{performance}} of vertical centrifugal <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> {{is quite different}} from clear water pump due to presence of solid particles in water. An approach to derive the performance behaviour of a vertical centrifugal pump used for transporting dredged slurry based on detail hydraulic loss analysis has been presented in this paper. The derived analytical data has been compared with experimental results. Performance analysis of a vertical submersible centrifugal <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> has been accomplished in two stages. At first, performance characteristics of the centrifugal pump with clear water have been investigated considering an indepth hydraulic loss analysis. Depending on the particle size distribution, the effect of solid particles on the performance characteristics of centrifugal <b>slurry</b> <b>pump</b> has been investigated considering volume fraction of particle size. The homogenous slurry with fine particles has been treated as Newtonian fluid with slurry viscosity and specific gravity. Additional hydraulic losses due to coarse solid particle have been considered for coarse slurry fraction.
