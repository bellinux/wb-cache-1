5|$|Although a {{fair use}} issue, Combs and Bad Boy never raised the legal <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fair use {{doctrine}} in their defense. This decision was questioned by some legal experts: Anthony Falzone of the Fair Use Project at Stanford Law School criticized Combs and Bad Boy for not defending {{the legality of}} sampling and suggested {{that they might have}} refused to raise such a defense because they feared it could later imperil their control over their own music.|$|E
5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} four novels, Fleming {{came up with}} the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front cover design; he considered Honeychile Rider to have a Venus-like quality when introduced in the book and wanted this echoed on the cover.

5|$|Between 1893 and 1904, Italy {{laid down}} eight battleships; the later {{two classes of}} ship were remarkably fast, though the Regina Margherita class was poorly {{protected}} and the Regina Elena class lightly armed. In some ways, these ships presaged the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battlecruiser. The Austro-Hungarian Empire also saw a naval renaissance during the 1890s, though of the nine pre-dreadnought battleships ordered only the three of the Habsburg class arrived before Dreadnought herself made them obsolete.|$|E
5|$|Chopin {{took the}} new salon genre of the nocturne, invented by the Irish {{composer}} John Field, {{to a deeper}} level of sophistication. He {{was the first to}} write ballades and scherzi as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (Op.28, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concert étude, already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op.10 published in 1833, Op.25 in 1837).|$|E
5|$|Critics {{have been}} mostly positive, {{although}} one initial poor review by Jan Moir {{was picked up}} by the mainstream media.

5|$|Development {{and testing}} {{continued}} until late 1938. Several variants of gun and carriage were proposed until on 15 December {{a combination of}} the T10 gun and T5 carriage was officially adopted as the 37mm Gun M3 and Carriage M4. Although the weapon followed the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PaK 36 and was often referred to as a copy of it, the M3 differed significantly from the German design and used different ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Google has {{questioned}} the proposal, saying the prohibitions {{would be too}} broad. It is strongly opposed by free speech groups.

5|$|Hydnellum is {{classified}} in the family Bankeraceae, which was circumscribed by Marinus Anton Donk in 1961. The genus was not in Donk's original family concept, which included only Bankera and Phellodon, genera whose species produce hyaline (translucent), and ornamented spores. Donk left Hydnellum in the tribe Hydnelleae of the family Thelephoraceae, along with Sarcodon and Hydnodon. In 1981, however, Walter Jülich emended Donk's <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bankeraceae, adding hydnoid genera that produced brown, lobed spores—Hydnellum and Sarcodon.|$|E

5|$|In 1905 Einstein {{postulated}} {{from the}} outset that {{the speed of light}} in vacuum, measured by a non-accelerating observer, is independent of the motion of the source or observer. Using this and the principle of relativity as a basis he derived the special theory of relativity, in which the speed of light in vacuum c featured as a fundamental constant, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light. This made the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stationary aether (to which Lorentz and Poincaré still adhered) useless and revolutionized the concepts of space and time.|$|E
