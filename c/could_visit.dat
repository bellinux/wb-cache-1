5|$|During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the Old City {{together}} with the Wall was controlled by Jordan. Article VIII of the 1949 Armistice Agreement provided for Israeli Jewish access to the Western Wall. However, for the following nineteen years, despite numerous requests by Israeli officials and Jewish groups to the United Nations and other international bodies to attempt to enforce the armistice agreement, Jordan refused to abide by this clause. Neither Israeli Arabs nor Israeli Jews <b>could</b> <b>visit</b> their holy places in the Jordanian territories.|$|E
5|$|It {{is clear}} from several sources that Donnchadh made these grants on the {{condition}} that the Abbey of Paisley established a Cluniac house in Carrick, but that the Abbey did not fulfil this condition, arguing that it was not obliged to do so. The Bishop of Glasgow intervened in 1244 and determined that a house of Cluniac monks from Paisley should indeed be founded there, that the house should be exempt from the jurisdiction of Paisley save recognition of the common Cluniac Order, but that the Abbot of Paisley <b>could</b> <b>visit</b> the house annually. After the foundation Paisley was to hand over its Carrick properties to the newly established monastery.|$|E

5|$|Seven {{years later}} the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba says: plundered the English {{as far as the}} river Tees, and he seized a {{multitude}} of people and many herds of cattle: and the Scots called this the raid of Albidosorum, that is, Nainndisi. But others say that Constantine made this raid, asking of the king, Malcolm, that the kingship should be given to him for a week's time, so that he <b>could</b> <b>visit</b> the English. In fact, it was Malcolm who made the raid, but Constantine incited him, as I have said. Woolf suggests that the association of Constantine with the raid is a late addition, one derived from a now-lost saga or poem.|$|E
5|$|Smaller {{works were}} not usually {{produced}} on commission. More often the masters anticipated the formats and images {{that would be}} most sought after and their designs were then developed by workshop members. Ready made paintings were sold at regularly held fairs, or the buyers <b>could</b> <b>visit</b> workshops, which tended to be clustered in {{certain areas of the}} major cities. The masters were allowed to display in their front windows. This was the typical mode for the thousands of panels produced for the middle class – city officials, clergy, guild members, doctors and merchants.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 2 is {{the only}} {{spacecraft}} that has visited Neptune. The spacecraft closest approach to the planet occurred on 25 August 1989. Because {{this was the last}} major planet the spacecraft <b>could</b> <b>visit,</b> it was decided to make a close flyby of the moon Triton, regardless of the consequences to the trajectory, similarly to what was done for Voyager 1s encounter with Saturn and its moon Titan. The images relayed back to Earth from Voyager 2 became the basis of a 1989 PBS all-night program, Neptune All Night.|$|E

25|$|Two subfamilies {{of storm}} petrel were {{traditionally}} recognized. The Oceanitinae, or austral storm-petrels, were mostly found in southern waters (though the Wilson's storm petrel regularly migrates into the northern hemisphere); {{there were seven}} species in five genera. The Hydrobatinae, or northern storm petrels, were the two genera Hydrobates and Oceanodroma. They were largely restricted to the northern hemisphere, although a few <b>could</b> <b>visit</b> or breed a short distance beyond the equator.|$|E

This was just like the case of Voyager 1's encounters with Saturn and its massive moon Titan.|$|E

Zehaf-Bibeau had received a Libyan passport in 2000 and then travelled to Libya in 2007.
