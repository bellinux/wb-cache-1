First, the paper discusses what IP problems managers have encountered. Second, it focuses on why such problems have arisen, i. e. why these problems are related to culture. Finally, the paper synthesises how the interviewed managers endeavour to solve the identified problems. To conclude, the paper draws to the attention of international business managers and researchers the fact that culture should be taken into account when dealing with IP-related <b>cross-border</b> <b>businesses...</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{the failure of the}} Avantis <b>cross-border</b> <b>business</b> estate. The {{inception}} of this hitherto largely undeveloped site took place in the early 1990 s, a period which we suggest characterising with the notion of EUphoria, that is, a widely held belief in the future of a borderless Europe. EUphoria is seen as the key to bringing together otherwise separate discourses under one shared ambition of constructing a <b>cross-border</b> <b>business</b> estate. With the fading of EUphoria, however, Avantis resurfaces as a shared problem and appears to have been built on expectations and promises held within a discourse of European integration rather than among private investors. In retrospect, Avantis as a product of EUphoria remains a EUtopia, albeit with very few believers...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cross-border</b> <b>business</b> {{transactions}} are complex. But in this globalized age, as commentators such as Ohmae have argued, business {{ought to be}} conducted simply despite national boundaries. Yet there are features of business that run counter to globalization and maintain a resolutely local character. A crucial aspect {{of this is the}} nature of law. No transaction can be carried out without a normative structure to provide a framework for the actors to operate within. Obligations, rights, warranties, covenants, and so on have to be specified and allocated. Even economists agree that the rule of law is essential for the conduct of business. States, however, jealously guard their legal systems and resist incursions in their jurisdictions by others. No matter the level of 2 ̆ 2 hyperlegality 2 ̆ 2 states adopt, they will always be incapable of providing all the necessary support structures for <b>cross-border</b> <b>business.</b> Our thesis is that although states 2 ̆ 7 legal systems are a basic necessary condition, they are no longer a sufficient condition for transnational business and enterprise, because a large part of states 2 ̆ 7 work has been transferred to and commandeered by other institutions [...] most notably, the internationally-operating law firms...|$|R
