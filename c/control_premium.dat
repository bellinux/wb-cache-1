25|$|Controlling {{interest}} {{level is}} the value that an investor {{would be willing to}} pay to acquire more than 50% of a company's stock, thereby gaining the attendant prerogatives of control. Some of the prerogatives of control include: electing directors, hiring and firing the company's management and determining their compensation; declaring dividends and distributions, determining the company's strategy and line of business, and acquiring, selling or liquidating the business. This level of value generally contains a <b>control</b> <b>premium</b> over the intermediate level of value, which typically ranges from 25% to 50%. An additional premium may be paid by strategic investors who are motivated by synergistic motives.|$|E

50|$|The Exit or Terminal Multiple Approach {{assumes a}} {{business}} {{will be sold}} {{at the end of}} the projection period. Valuation analytics are determined for various operating statistics using comparable acquisitions. A frequently used terminal multiple is Enterprise Value/EBITDA or EV/EBITDA. The analysis of comparable acquisitions will indicate an appropriate range of multiples to use. The multiple is then applied to the projected EBITDA in Year N, which is the final year in the projection period. This provides a future value at the end of Year N. The terminal value is then discounted using a factor equal to the number of years in the projection period. If N is the 5th and final year in this period, then the Terminal Value is divided by (1+k)5. The Present Value of the Terminal Value is then added to the PV of the free cash flows in the projection period to arrive at an implied Enterprise Value. Note that if publicly traded comparable company multiples must be used, the resulting implied enterprise value will not reflect a <b>control</b> <b>premium.</b> Depending on the purposes of the valuation, this may not provide an appropriate reference range.|$|E
5000|$|The {{valuation}} approaches {{yield the}} {{fair market value}} of the Company as a whole. In valuing a minority, non-controlling interest in a business, however, the valuation professional must consider the applicability of discounts that affect such interests.Discussions of discounts and premiums frequently begin with a review of the [...] "levels of value". There are three common levels of value: controlling interest, marketable minority, and non-marketable minority.The intermediate level, marketable minority interest, is less than the controlling interest level and higher than the non-marketable minority interest level. The marketable minority interest level represents the perceived value of equity interests that are freely traded without any restrictions. These interests are generally traded on the New York Stock Exchange, AMEX, NASDAQ, and other exchanges where there is a ready market for equity securities. These values represent a minority interest in the subject companies - small blocks of stock that represent less than 50% of the company's equity, and usually much less than 50%.Controlling interest level is the value that an investor {{would be willing to pay}} to acquire more than 50% of a company's stock, thereby gaining the attendant prerogatives of control. Some of the prerogatives of control include: electing directors, hiring and firing the company's management and determining their compensation; declaring dividends and distributions, determining the company's strategy and line of business, and acquiring, selling or liquidating the business. This level of value generally contains a <b>control</b> <b>premium</b> over the intermediate level of value, which typically ranges from 25% to 50%. An additional premium may be paid by strategic investors who are motivated by synergistic motives.Non-marketable, minority level is the lowest level on the chart, representing the level at which non-controlling equity interests in private companies are generally valued or traded. This level of value is discounted because no ready market exists in which to purchase or sell interests. Private companies are less [...] "liquid" [...] than publicly traded companies, and transactions in private companies take longer and are more uncertain. Between the intermediate and lowest levels of the chart, there are restricted shares of publicly traded companies.Despite a growing inclination of the IRS and Tax Courts to challenge valuation discounts, Shannon Pratt suggested in a scholarly presentation recently that valuation discounts are actually increasing as the differences between public and private companies is widening [...] Publicly traded stocks have grown more liquid in the past decade due to rapid electronic trading, reduced commissions, and governmental deregulation. These developments have not improved the liquidity of interests in private companies, however.Valuation discounts are multiplicative, so they must be considered in order. Control premiums and their inverse, minority interest discounts, are considered before marketability discounts are applied.|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} thesis {{deals with}} discounts and premiums in business valuation, especially lack of marketability discount and <b>control</b> <b>premium</b> (minority discount). There are no complex theoretical publications concerning these topics in the Czech Republic. Abroad, the publications are mostly descriptions and results of empirical studies originated in U. S. markets. These empirical studies usually {{deal with a}} single or a few aspects of a discount or premium. There are still some blank areas in the discounts and premiums theory even abroad, such as the sources of <b>control</b> <b>premium,</b> relationship between the levels of value and standards of value, {{the relation between the}} value of a company as a whole and the value at the level of shareholders. I develop a theoretical model of <b>control</b> <b>premium,</b> in the dissertation, which is trying to fill-in these blank areas and thus help practitioners to deal with the <b>control</b> <b>premium</b> or minority discount in a correct way. Moreover the model shows how protection of minority shareholders in general and especially during acquisitions influences the magnitude of <b>control</b> <b>premium.</b> It also shows that the magnitude of <b>control</b> <b>premium</b> depends on the market competition structure. If the competition is perfect (as we can suppose it would be at financial markets for minority interests) or there is a strong oligopsonistic competition the subjects of transaction are not able to influence the price, whereas for monopsonic structure (as it usually is in the M&A market in the Czech Republic) the subjects can influence the price. For monopsonic structure at the M&A market I conclude it is impossible to estimate the value of transaction as a point estimate since it will depend on nonfinancial factors what the price of transaction will be. We can only estimate the upper and lower boundary of interval the final price of transaction will lie within. The boundaries are the maximum price for the acquirer and minimum price for the seller in the sense of German Köln School. The dissertation also tests the possibility and theoretical correctness of using the results of foreign empirical studies of discounts and premiums for valuing businesses in the CR. We analyze the methodology and synthetize the problems connected with application of results of various studies. I conclude {{that it is impossible to}} use the results directly in the conditions of the CR. I suggest there should be a deeper analysis done and factors that influence the magnitude analyzed and considered. We should not rely just on averages. The thesis also contains an empirical part testing the magnitude of the lack of marketability discount in the Czech Republic...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{the great}} tide of {{globalization}} has caused M 2 ̆ 6 A activities {{to spill over}} into controlling shareholder regimes (economies dominated by controlling shareholders). Due to a seismic change arising from an unprecedented takeover wave, transplanting the Delaware pill has been heavily discussed in controlling shareholder regimes. This Article explores how legal and socio-economic conditions of the United States (State of Delaware) and controlling shareholder regimes are different and why transplanting the Delaware pill could create unintended results in controlling shareholder regimes. First, {{the legitimacy of the}} Delaware pill is supported by corporate governance institutions, such as a relatively functional board, a ballot box safety valve, and an efficient judiciary. Many controlling shareholder jurisdictions, however, do not have these lynchpins. As a result, the transplanted pill in controlling shareholder regimes could be absolute and M 2 ̆ 6 A activities would be stifled. Second, the Delaware pill has invited a large number of friendly deals in the United States since the market has adjusted to the pill by developing a generous severance pay system. However, such a system is not legally or politically permissible in many controlling shareholder regimes. As a result, the transplanted pill would not encourage friendly M 2 ̆ 6 A, but simply entrench target corporate insiders. Controlling shareholders may be more interested in a <b>control</b> <b>premium</b> than severance pay. The transplanted pill could enhance a controlling shareholder’s negotiation leverage and, as a result, the <b>control</b> <b>premium.</b> However, when a <b>control</b> <b>premium</b> should be shared with non-dominant shareholders by law or social norm, controlling shareholders are likely to be reluctant to initiate M 2 ̆ 6 A activities in the first place. On the other hand, when controlling shareholders are allowed to take a substantial fraction of <b>control</b> <b>premium,</b> it cuts directly against a core rationale of adopting the pill, i. e., protecting weak non-dominant shareholders...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{premiums}} paid in successful tender offers and mergers involving NYSE and Amex-listed target firms from 1975 - 91 {{in relation to}} pre-announcement stock price runups. It has been conventional to measure corporate <b>control</b> <b>premiums</b> including the price runups that occur before the initial formal bid. There has been little evidence on {{the relation between the}} pre-bid runup and the post-announcement premium (the premium paid to target stockholders measured from the date of the first bid). Under what circumstances are runups associated with larger total premiums? The evidence in this paper shows that in most cases, the pre-bid runup and the post- announcement premium are uncorrelated (i. e. little or no substitution between the runup and the post-announcement premium), so the runup is an added cost to the bidder. This has important implications for assessing the costs of illegal insider trading based on private information about a potential bid. ...|$|R
