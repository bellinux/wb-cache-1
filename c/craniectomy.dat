25|$|A form {{of surgery}} is the {{so-called}} fronto-supraorbital advancement and remodelling. Firstly, the supraorbital bar is remodelled by a wired greenstick fracture to straighten it.

Lastly, the frontal bone is divided into two, rotated and attached to the supraorbital bar causing a nude area (<b>craniectomy)</b> between the parietal bone and frontal bone. Bone will eventually regenerate since the dura mater lies underneath (the dura mater has osteogenic capabilities). This results in an advancement and straightening of the forehead.|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{advances}} in imaging and surgical techniques, spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) has defied {{attempts to find}} a scientifically proven effective therapy. The pathophysiology of SICH suggests that early removal of the clot with minimal additional surgical trauma should prove beneficial.

This has led to substantial variability in the management of ICH throughout the world, and the treatment of SICH remains a controversy. SICH encompasses spectra of possible clot locations with varying volumes. Surgery so far has been reserved only for patients with large hematomas and impending brain herniation. Critical analysis of the earlier studies has now shown that surgery does help in clots in certain locations and of particular volume and when done at an optimal time. Poor grade patients with large hematomas, earlier considered poor surgical candidates are being taken up for aggressive decompressive <b>craniectomies</b> with fair results.

50|$|Strip <b>craniectomy</b> {{was easier}} and {{involved}} less blood loss {{compared with the}} newer cranial vault reconstruction.

Consequently, strip <b>craniectomy</b> lost favor, and the surgical treatment has been modified to include cranial vault remodeling.

The operation was shown to be a success in a study of 12 patients, all younger than 8 months. Critical to this success and a departure from the standard strip craniosynostectomy was the extensive use of a postoperative remodeling helmet. Although first introduced by Persing et al. in 1986, helmet therapy has not been used as extensively as a postoperative therapeutic intervention.|$|E
40|$|Laser-based {{diagnostics}} and therapeutics show {{promise for}} many neurological disorders. However, the poor transparency of cranial bone (calvaria) limits the spatial resolu tion and interaction depth {{that can be}} achieved, thus constraining opportunity in this regard. Herein, we report preliminary results from efforts seeking to address this limitation through use of novel transparent cranial implants made from nanocrystalline yttria-stabilized zirconia (nc-YSZ). Using optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of underlying brain in an acute murine model, we show that signal strength is improved when imaging through nc-YSZ implants relative to native cranium. As such, this provides initial evidence supporting the feasibility of nc-YSZ as a transparent cranial implant material.

40|$|OBJECT: The risk of {{surgical}} site infection (SSI) after craniotomies or <b>craniectomies</b> in patients in whom contaminated bone flaps have been reimplanted {{has not been}} determined. The objectives {{of this study were}} to identify the prevalence of bone flaps with positive cultures [...] especially those contaminated with Propionibacterium acnes [...] to assess the risk of SSI after reimplanting (either during the initial operation or subsequently) bone flaps with positive cultures, and to identify risk factors for SSI following the initial craniotomies or <b>craniectomies.</b> METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of cases in which patients underwent craniotomy/craniectomy procedures between January and October 2007 in the neurosurgery department at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. They also reviewed processes and procedures and did pulsed field gel electrophoresis of P. acnes isolates to look for a common source of contamination. They then conducted a prospective cohort study that included all patients who underwent craniotomy/craniectomy procedures between November 2007 and November 2008 and met the study criteria. For the cohort study, the authors obtained cultures from each patient 2 ̆ 7 s bone flap during the craniotomy/craniectomy procedures. Data about potential risk factors were collected by circulating nurses during the procedures or by a research assistant who reviewed medical records after the procedures. An infection preventionist independently identified SSIs through routine surveillance using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2 ̆ 7 s definitions. Univariate and bivariate analyses were performed to determine the association between SSI and potential risk factors. RESULTS: The retrospective review did not identify specific breaks in aseptic technique or a common source of P. acnes. Three hundred seventy-three patients underwent 393 craniotomy/craniectomy procedures during the cohort study period, of which 377 procedures met the study criteria. Fifty percent of the bone flaps were contaminated by microorganisms, primarily skin flora such as P. acnes, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Staphylococcus aureus. Reimplanting bone flaps that had positive culture results did not increase the risk of infection after the initial craniotomy/craniectomy procedures and the subsequent cranioplasty procedures (p = 0. 80). Allowing the skin antiseptic to dry before the procedures (p = 0. 04, OR 0. 26) was associated with lower risk of SSIs. Female sex (p = 0. 02, OR = 3. 49) was associated with an increased risk of SSIs; Gliadel wafer implants (p = 0. 001, OR = 8. 38) were associated with an increased risk of SSIs after procedures to treat tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Operative factors such as the way the skin is prepared before the incision rather than the skin flora contaminants on the bone flaps may {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of SSIs after craniotomy/craniectomy.

At seven to eight days later, measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) and estimates of the sizes of the ischemic and infarcted areas of the brains were made. Neurological deficits were more severe and the ischemic and infarcted regions were larger in the cats given acetazolamide. Cerebral edema (brain swelling) was present and reactive hyperemia was common in the treated cats, even one week after MCA occlusion. The hypercapnia and decreases of pH of nonischemic brain tissue that are caused by acetazolamide are harmful for ischemic brain tissue, presumably because of vasodilatation in nonischemic brain tissue with resultant increases of intracranial pressure and decreases of CBF of ischemic regions.

Mean age was 24.43 years. 60 %(90 / 150) {{cases were}} with severe TBI, and 29 & 31 % were with {{moderate}} and mild TBI respectively depending upon their initial (GCS). Road traffic accident {{was the most}} common cause of TBI 46 %(70 / 150), followed by fall from height, 41 %. 13 cases due to industrial accidents, 3 sports related, 2 due to assault & 1 due to gunshot injury lead to TBI. In 81 patients (54 %) different neurosurgical interventions (burr-hole,craniotomy, intracranial pressure monitoring-ICP and decompressive <b>craniectomies)</b> were performed depending upon the initial clinical condition. ICP monitoring was done in 47 cases as isolated or in combination with other therapeutic procedures. In 72 % of cases correction of hyponatremia was achieved within 48 hours of onset and in 28 % it took longer time (> 48 hours) to correct S.Na. Mean S.Na before treatment was 131.2 + 2.9, lowest value of 117 mmol/l and mean S.Na post treatment of hyponatremia was 137.6 + 2.5.

30|$|Furthermore, {{there are}} still many debates {{regarding}} the recent two RCTs. The BHYPO trial was stopped early before the scheduled sample size (300 cases) was reached because of a concern about a shortage of TBI patients (95 cases). The actual sample size was far below the intended target, which might produce bias. For the Eurotherm 3235 trial, there were many more debates. Kiwon Lee considered that hypothermia might be helpful only in those patients with truly severe TBI (Lee 2015). Patients in the Eurotherm 3235 trial, including all TBI patients with ICP greater than 20  mmHg for 5  min after stage 1, might not be the right population to support the value of hypothermia. As a matter of fact, some controversial therapies may be effective only in more critically ill patients. Therefore, it was not surprising to observe that some patients did well no matter what therapy was used. The Eurotherm 3235 trial did not compare the combination of TH and standard therapy to standard therapy alone. In the TH group, mannitol and hypertonic saline were not given unless hypothermia failed to control ICP, which differed from the practice of many other medical centers where TH was used synchronously with standard therapy. In the Eurotherm 3235 trial, hypothermia alone was compared to the combination of mannitol and hypertonic saline. Additionally, many independent variables that might affect the long-term clinical outcomes, such as nutrition and advanced rehabilitation capabilities, that might affect the outcome rather significantly. Control of these factors was difficult after patients were discharged from the hospital. Additionally, more patients in the NT group of the Eurotherm 3235 trial, though there was no statistical difference, had decompressive <b>craniectomies,</b> which might decrease intracranial hypertension more effectively and influence the outcomes between the TH and NT groups.|$|R
40|$|Background. Given the {{improved}} survival of patients requiring decompressive <b>craniectomies,</b> {{the frequency of}} subsequent cranioplasties are on the rise. The most feared complication of autologous cranioplasty is infection and one method for reducing the rate of infection, is to store the bone flaps at subnormal temperatures. However, to date there is no defined temperature for flap storage and temperature ranges from − 18 to − 83 °C have been described in literature. Considering our limited resources {{it has been the}} practice at our center to store bone flaps at − 26 °C. In this study, we have retrospectively reviewed our practice and have audited this choice of temperature with respect to the frequency of infections. Methods. A retrospective review was conducted for all cranioplasties performed at our center between January 2001 to March 2011, using autologous bone which was cryopreserved according to institutional protocol. During this period the operative and cryopreservation protocol remained the same. All patient records including charts, notes and laboratory findings were reviewed with a specific focus to identify infections. Results. Of the 88 patients included in the study, only 3 (3. 40 %) patients were found to show signs of infection. Of these, two patients had superficial surgical site infections which resolved with oral antibiotics (Co-Amoxiclav 1 gm BD for 7 days). However the third patient developed deep surgical site infection requiring re-exploration and washout. All three patients had complete resolution of infection with preservation of autologous bone. Conclusion. Despite our method of keeping the bone flap in freezer at − 26 °C we have reported an acceptable rate of infection and raised the notion whether there is a justification for sophisticated and costly equipment for bone flap preservation, especially in resource depleted setups.
