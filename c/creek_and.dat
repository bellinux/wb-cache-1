5|$|Briar Creek begins where Knob Mountain, Huntington Mountain, and Lee Mountain meet {{in western}} Briar Creek Township.

Soon afterwards, the stream picks up the tributary West Branch Briar <b>Creek</b> <b>and</b> turns southeast. After some distance, it enters the community of Briar <b>Creek</b> <b>and</b> picks up the tributary East Branch Briar Creek. The stream then turns southwest and reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River near French Island.|$|E
