40|$|Forward error {{correction}} (FEC) plays {{a vital role}} in <b>coherent</b> <b>optical</b> <b>systems</b> employing multi-level modulation. However, much of coding theory assumes that additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is dominant, whereas <b>coherent</b> <b>optical</b> <b>systems</b> have significant phase noise (PN) in addition to AWGN. This changes the error statistics and impacts FEC performance. In this paper, we propose a novel semianalytical method for dimensioning binary Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes for systems with PN. Our method involves extracting statistics from pre-FEC bit error rate (BER) simulations. We use these statistics to parameterize a bivariate binomial model that describes the distribution of bit errors. In this way, we relate pre-FEC statistics to post-FEC BER and BCH codes. Our method is applicable to pre-FEC BER around 10 - 3 and any post-FEC BER. Using numerical simulations, we evaluate the accuracy of our approach for a target post-FEC BER of 10 - 5. Codes dimensioned with our bivariate binomial model meet the target within 0. 2 -dB signal-to-noise ratio...|$|R

In addition, if implemented in the frequency domain, this form of blind equalization is more computationally efficient than when a separate RRC is used. It is also verified that this method is not sensitive to frequency offset.
