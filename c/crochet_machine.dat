50|$|In 1877 the world's first <b>crochet</b> <b>machine</b> {{was invented}} and {{patented}} by Joseph M. Merrow, then-president {{of what had}} started in the 1840s as a machine shop to develop specialized machinery for the knitting operations. This <b>crochet</b> <b>machine</b> was the first production overlock sewing machine. The Merrow Machine Company {{went on to become}} one of the largest American Manufacturers of overlock sewing machines, and continues to be a global presence in the 21st century as the last American over-lock sewing machine manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|When done by machine, it may {{be called}} a whip stitch or, sometimes, a Merrow Crochet Stitch, after the first sewing machine {{that was used to}} sew a blanket stitch. This machine was {{produced}} and patented by the Merrow Machine Company in 1877. The defining characteristic of the <b>crochet</b> <b>machine</b> is its ability to sew with yarn and stitch thick goods with a consistent overlock edge. From 1877-1925 the machine evolved dramatically, and consequently so did the capacity of manufacturers to produce goods with the whip stitch.|$|E
50|$|In Conjunction {{with the}} {{knitting}} business, the first <b>Crochet</b> <b>Machines</b> were constructed for finishing around {{the tops of}} men's socks in place of handwork. The Merrow machine {{as it is now}} known, was an invention of Mr. Joseph M. Merrow, who was president of the company until his death in 1947 at age 98.|$|R

50|$|Munsing was a {{technologist}} and {{the company}} received several patents, including those for a <b>crocheting</b> <b>machine</b> in 1891 and a union suit in the early 1890s. The union suit was the company's flagship product until the 1920s, when central heating made it less useful. It continued until 1969. The cream-colored garment became iconic and was featured in the company's advertising with children and adults outfitted in them; underwear ads had never used live models before. In 1894 Munsing left the company.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} aims to {{investigate}} {{the effects of the}} ratio of different rubber threads on the elastic, tensile, air permeability, andfar-infrared emissivity properties ofelastic warp-knitted fabric. Polyester filaments and rubber threads were applied as warp yarns while bamboo charcoal(BC) /Nylon(NY) filament was used as weft yarn to fabricate elastic knitted fabric (EKF) by using Velcro <b>Crochet</b> <b>Machine.</b> The four different ratios of rubber threads in warp direction were 0 %, 25 %, 50 % and 100 %. The result revealed that with the increase in weight ratio of the rubber thread, the air permeability decreased while the tensile elongation tended to increase in both warp and weft directions...|$|E
40|$|Multifunction elastic {{warp-knitted}} fabrics were fabricated on a <b>crochet</b> <b>machine</b> {{with the}} use of metal composite yarns/viscose yarn and bamboo polyester/ crisscross-section polyester hybrid yarns as the front face and back face of the knitted fabric structure, respectively. We investigated the effect of the blend ratio of bamboo charcoal/ crisscross-section polyester multiply yarns on the fabric's moisture comfort properties, such as water vapour transmission (WVT), water evaporation rate (WER), and water absorbency. The results showed that blending ratio significantly influenced WVT and WER. Moreover, antibacterial activity of the elastic warp- knitted fabric was tested against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in accordance with AATCC 90 - 2011. Finally, the extension- stress value curves were used to analyse the elastic stretching property, and the fabric exhibited greater breaking elongation and lower stress value in the walewise than in the weft direction...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{sportswear}} fabrics are functional textiles {{that can}} mitigate the impaired muscles caused by exercises for the wearers, {{but they can}} also cause discomfort and skin allergy. This study proposes combining two yarns to form functional composite yarns, by using a twisting or wrapping process. Moreover, a different twist number is used in order to adjust the performance of functional composite yarns. A <b>crochet</b> <b>machine</b> is used to make the functional composite yarns into functional elastic knits that are suitable for use in sportswear. The test results show that, in comparison to the non-processed yarns, using the twisted or wrapped yarns can considerably decrease the water vapor transmission rate of functional elastic knits by 38 %, while also improving their far infrared emissivity by 13 %, water absorption rate by 39 %, and air permeability by 136 %. In particular, the functional elastic knits that are made of B-wrapped yarns (bamboo charcoal- wrapped yarns), composed of 20 twists per inch, have the optimal diverse functions...|$|E
50|$|The Merrow® Sewing Machine Company, {{best known}} for inventing the {{overlock}} sewing machine is a manufacturer of sewing machines. After the explosion of his gunpowder mill in 1837, in 1838 J.M. Merrow built a knitting mill on the same site. The company developed <b>crocheting</b> <b>machines</b> for its own use and by 1887 evolved to design, build and market sewing machines exclusively. During its early decades it was organized as a partnership under various names: established in 1838 as Joseph M. Merrow & Sons by J. Makens Merrow, then Pitkin, Merrow, & Co., renamed Merrow Manufacturing Co. in 1857, then Merrow and Millard in 1863, J.B. Merrow and Sons in 1870, and incorporated as The Merrow Manufacturing Company in 1893. Originally all of its manufacturing was done at facilities in Merrow, Connecticut and then in Hartford, Connecticut after 1894. The company is currently based in Fall River, Massachusetts.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As {{improvement}} {{of science and}} technology, the life quality was significantly promoted. And people are more aware of health care. It has been proved that bamboo charcoal owns special properties including air purification, water refining, deodorization, far-infrared radiation, and anion release, thus it is widely applied on textile industry in form of fiber and yarn after mixing with its power. This study aims to seek for the optimal twist number of bamboo charcoal (BC) /Nylon(NY) / stainless steel(SS) wrap yarn. And then {{the one or two}} wrap yarns were fed into <b>crocheting</b> <b>machine</b> to weave BC/NY/SS elastic warp-knitted fabrics with different structures. Afterwards, the far-infrared radiation, anion amount, air permeability were discussed by changes of number of layers. The result shows that, as increasing layers of BC/NY/SS elastic warp-knitted fabrics, the far-infrared radiation and air permeability both decrease; but all the single-layer warp knitted fabric reaches above 0. 8, corresponding with the functional standards...|$|R
5000|$|Overlock {{stitching}} {{was invented}} by the Merrow Machine Company in 1881.J. Makens Merrow and his son Joseph Merrow, who owned a knitting mill established in Connecticut in 1838, developed a number of technological advancements {{to be used in}} the mill’s operations. Merrow's first patent was a <b>machine</b> for <b>crochet</b> stitching, and the Merrow Machine Company still produces <b>crochet</b> <b>machines</b> based on this original model. This technology was a starting point for the development of the overlock machine, patented by Joseph Merrow in 1889. Unlike standard lockstitching, which uses a bobbin, overlock sewing machines utilize loopers to create thread loops for the needle to pass through, in a manner similar to crocheting. Merrow's original three-thread overedge sewing machine is the forerunner of contemporary overlocking machines. Over time, the Merrow Machine Company pioneered the design of new machines to create a variety of overlock stitches, such as two- and four-thread machines, the one-thread butted seam, and the cutterless emblem edger.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Cotton fiber {{is a type}} {{of natural}} fibers. Using natural fibers to {{fabricate}} textile can not only decrease the consumption of synthetic fibers, but also reduce the environmental pollution. This study aims to fabricate elastic knitted fabrics and evaluate their properties. Polyester (PET) filaments and rubber threads serve as the warp while cotton yarn serves as the weft for warp knitting. A <b>crochet</b> <b>machine</b> makes the warp and weft into warp knits with desirable stretchability, during which the amount (single/double) and the ply number (1 -, 2 -, and 3 -ply) of the weft are further varied. The resulting warp knits are evaluated for water absorption, air permeability, and mechanical properties. As demonstrated by the experimental results, the warp knits with single 1 -ply weft (S 1) yield an optimal air permeability of 224. 6 cm 3 /cm 2 /s and stiffness along the warp direction of 4. 74 cm. The warp knits with single 2 -ply weft (S 2) display an optimal tearing strength of 86 N while the warp knits with double 3 -ply weft (D 3 / 3) has an optimal tensile strength of 708 N...|$|E
50|$|Joseph Merrow was {{the driving}} force behind Merrow {{developing}} new technology, growing the new business and transforming it from a regional supplier of <b>crochet</b> sewing <b>machines,</b> to the market leader manufacturing hundreds of models of industrial overlock sewing machines. Under his leadership the company achieved a place of prominence in the industrial machine field with sales world-wide, hundreds of patents and the industries first industrial overlock sewing machine.|$|R
40|$|There are not {{too many}} machine {{builders}} in the warp knitting industry and she does not see many exhibitors showing warp knitting machines even at major exhibitions such as ITMA. ITMA 2003 was no exception. Only 6 booths in Hall 5 displayed warp knitting type <b>machines,</b> including <b>crochet</b> <b>machines.</b> The players in this business are few but outstanding. It {{is fair to say}} that Karl Mayer and Liba, both of Germany, are the two leaders and major suppliers in warp knitting, and their machines are never disappointing. At ITMA 2003 Karl Mayer no doubt drew most of the attention by the introduction of their new lace machines and new string bar for patterning. Enhancement of a conventional machine also resulted in the still more productive HKS 2 - 3 (E). The other major player, Liba, had a smaller scale exhibition this time with fewer machines than on previous occasions. The fine machine Liba displayed, the Copcentra 2 KE, was just as impressive, with a speed of 3, 500 rpm. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
50|$|Established in 1838, {{the family}} {{business}} was the manufacture of knit cotton goods; {{it was the first}} of its kind in the country. In 1888 the family's mills were destroyed by fire related to an incident with gunpowder. J. B. Merrow held a patent on gunpowder. The destruction of the mill allowed the company to further develop a small shop that had previously supported the knitting mill, and the Merrow Mills thus became primarily a manufacturer of <b>crochet</b> sewing <b>machines.</b>|$|R
40|$|Science-fiction {{literature}} {{introduced the}} term terraforming and defined {{it as the}} process of creation of an Earth like habitat on a new and uncharted planet (Dennis, 2011). Aerial photographs taken while flying to Iowa were the visual inspiration for this project. Besides Vitruvius Pollio 2 ̆ 7 s (circa 27 BC) guiding principles of garden design,commodity, firmness and delight,, zero waste in multiple forms was also {{used to create a}} sustainable wardrobe capsule. Free form <b>crochet,</b> hand knitting, <b>machine</b> knitting, beading, tasseling and hand sewing were techniques employed to build the knitted piece row by row using various textural yarns. The idea of infinity was furthermore embedded in the knitted stitches by continuously changing and alternating the textural yarns. Overall, the ensemble feels lightweight and see-through just as an aerial photograph, without missing the textural density of a landscape design or the complexity of fibers and techniques of a terraforming capsule.
