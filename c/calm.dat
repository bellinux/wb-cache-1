The present research used traffic microsimulation to study the effect of traffic <b>calming</b> devices on the cross-town roads capacity based on different type and spacing of devices.

40|$|Canadian {{municipalities}} {{are considering}} traffic <b>calming</b> to mitigate neighbourhood traffic concerns. However, traffic <b>calming</b> experience in Canada is limited and isolated to date. As a result, {{there is not}} a consistent definition of traffic <b>calming</b> and only limited reference information about the design and impact of typical traffic <b>calming</b> measures to guide implementation. Despite these unknowns, many jurisdictions are proceeding with unique traffic <b>calming</b> implementations in response to growing political and public pressures. A survey undertaken in 1993 by the Transportation Association of Canada (TAC) confirmed that there were widely differing opinions on and applications of traffic <b>calming</b> measures across Canada. Recognizing there was a need for direction, TAC, in cooperation with the Canadian Institute of Transportation Engineers (CITE), initiated a project to develop a Canadian neighbourhood traffic <b>calming</b> guide. The guide will define trafFic <b>calming,</b> outline a public consultation and implementation process, identify the measures available and present typical design guidelines. A consultant assignment is presently on-going to develop the first edition of the document. The guide will enable a consistent approach to traffic <b>calming</b> across Canada, eliminating the need for local municipalities to develop their own guidelines. It will assist in overcoming the reluctance exhibited by some transportation professionals to use trafic <b>calming</b> measures and will also help address the liability concerns that are often expressed. The partnership arrangement between TAC and CITE provides an excellent opportunity to share resources to the mutual benefit of both organizations and all transportation practitioners in Canada...|$|R

In Turkish urban streets, there is not widely applied traffic <b>calming</b> projects by local authorities. On the other hand, traffic <b>calming</b> elements can be used effectively in Turkish urban streets in order to solve traffic-related community problems. Since, the most important objectives of traffic <b>calming</b> are to provide equity in residential streets, and to make them more liveable places. The case study focused on the application of the traffic <b>calming</b> elements in two residential streets which are used for cut-through traffic. By comparing the aplied traffic <b>calming</b> projects, by identifying advantages and disadvantages of traffic <b>calming</b> elements and problems of the case study streets in terms of cultural and spatial constraints, a look-up table was constituted. According to this table, the most suitable traffic <b>calming</b> elements were suggested in order to discourage cut-through traffic and to decrease traffic volume on the streets. At the end of the study, survey showed that traffic <b>calming</b> is very foreign concept for the residents in the study site. However, it was concluded that for a street based traffic <b>calming</b> project a look-up table can be very useful in order to find the best solution for that street...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{increase}} of traffic, roads have been widened and straightened to accommodate more and faster vehicle traffic. These changes facilitate driving but often degrade conditions for walking and cycling. Traffic <b>calming</b> {{is the name}} for road design strategies to reduce vehicle speed and volumes. There are many potential traffic <b>calming</b> strategies, some are indicated in technical specifications for traffic <b>calming</b> (TSC 03. 800 : 2000). Due to new findings in demands in traffic <b>calming</b> these specifications should be updated or completely replaced. Two of the main problems are solved in this paper. The first change is {{in the way the}} guidelines are presented and are now based on Danish example. More consideration has been given to the relation of traffic <b>calming</b> measures and traffic volumes. This connection has been implemented in guidelines. As a new mean of traffic <b>calming,</b> roundabout has been added. The effect off each traffic <b>calming</b> measure is based on before-after studies, which were made in United States of America. This method is used to determine situation on the streets before and after implication of the traffic <b>calming</b> measure. The guidelines that are result of this paper are different than existing guidelines, which confirms my thesis, that the existing guidelines should be updated or completely replaced...|$|R

40|$|Analysis of {{operational}} conditions and behavioural parameters at not standard roundabouts) Traffic <b>calming</b> schemes {{refer to a}} combination of road network planning and engineering measures to minimize undesirable effects of traffic in residential areas. The traffic <b>calming</b> role in urban road network management is, indeed, to enhance road safety as well as other aspects of liveability for the citizens; in this context accident reduction can be a realistic objective. Several studies highlight that traffic <b>calming</b> treatments can significantly reduce road accidents in urban areas. Nevertheless, the increase of the accident rate per kilometre travelled has been found in urban areas as result of the so-called accident migration phenomenon. Starting from these considerations, the paper discusses the effects of traffic <b>calming</b> measures on road safety. The paper also aims to provide a concise overview of knowledge on the potential of the meta-analysis method in detecting the true effect of traffic <b>calming</b> measures on road safety.

The objective of this research is to perform a comparative study of traffic <b>calming</b> decision making process, which is expected to serve as a basis for introducing in Japan as well in some communities where there is no traffic <b>calming</b> process guiding principle is available. A mail based questionnaire survey of North America and some European countries was conducted to know the traffic <b>calming</b> process and types of devices currently in use.
