40|$|In {{this work}} we study the <b>order</b> <b>consolidation</b> process of an e-retailing {{warehouse}} using real data. <b>Order</b> <b>consolidation</b> {{is a process}} that follows the picking operation in a warehouse. After stock keeping units (SKUs) of an order are picked into possibly multiple totes, they are sorted and the SKUs are consolidated back into orders to be packed and shipped to customers. There are two main operations in order consolidation: wave sortation and putting. Wave sortation involves tote sequencing which is a major driver of how smooth the system runs. First, totes should be sequenced so that the work load is balanced. Second, totes that carry SKUs of the same order should be close in sequence in order to reduce order processing times, and to reduce resource utilization. At the same time, orders should be assigned to operators for putting in order to balance operator workload and to avoid recirculation. The assignment and sequencing of totes, when assuming known and constant tote induction times and when the goal is total completion time, is a problem similar to parallel machine scheduling. However, the goal from <b>order</b> <b>consolidation</b> is minimizing <b>order,</b> as opposed to tote, <b>consolidation</b> times. <b>Order</b> <b>consolidation</b> also depends on the putting operation. Moreover, processing times are uncertain and may vary because of different sizes and weights of SKUs and because of variations in manual and automatic processes. In order to reflect a realistic system performance accurately, we need to take randomness into account when evaluating measures like order completion time, resource utilization, and congestion. In this thesis, we first build a simulation model for the consolidation process using a given tote assignment and sequencing. We use the empirical distributions derived from the data to run the simulation. Second, we develop a simulated annealing heuristic and apply it to solve the deterministic tote sequencing problem with the goal of minimizing order completion time or order processing time. Third, we develop a stochastic simulated annealing algorithm to optimize the whole consolidation process. The algorithm decides on tote assignment and sequencing and evaluates the sequences using the simulation model. We experimented with optimizing order completion times and SKU wait times for putting. Our approach is then a simulation optimization to optimize the consolidation process using different metrics. We report on numerical tests using real instances...|$|R
40|$|In this Article the Author {{addresses}} the issues surrounding consolidation, {{the situation that}} arises when a court decides the merits of a dispute {{based solely on the}} record produced at a hearing on motion for a preliminary injunction. The Author identifies some of the more flagrant abuses that trial and appellate courts have committed in reaching the merits after only a hearing on a motion for preliminary relief. The proposed amendments discussed in the Article would serve both courts and parties. They would prevent the kind of abuses discussed in this article by requiring that the parties be informed of the procedural setting in which the court intends to operate. They would also afford the parties the opportunity to object to a <b>consolidation</b> <b>order</b> {{in much the same way}} as parties do when faced with a summary judgment motion. The provisions would insure that due process is provided and that parties have the chance to present all the evidence they plan to introduce. The proposed amendments are also designed to avoid tying the hands of the courts. While the judges may still play an active role in litigation, the proposed changes clarify what that role should be by adding specific procedures to govern a disposition on the merits after only a hearing on a motion for a preliminary injunction...|$|E
40|$|Shipment {{consolidation}} {{is often}} utilized for gaining transportation cost reductions by economies of scale. This study examines the intercompany shipment consolidation {{process in a}} third-party warehouse {{from the viewpoint of}} the case company’s main distribution center (MDC), which is responsible for spare parts distribution. The case company is a manufacturer of industrial machinery and the requirement for shipment consolidation arose from a special capital equipment sales, in which a specific spare parts package is offered along with the capital equipment. Due to the scarcity of such special orders, the intercompany shipment consolidation process has not been defined at MDC. The main objective {{of this study was to}} define the intercompany shipment consolidation process, recognize its bottlenecks and problems and provide improvement ideas to it. The theoretical part of the study concentrates on supply chain and supply chain management, while discussing topics such as logistics and supply chain integration. Also, more specific subjects regarding this study were covered, as the basics of shipment consolidation, third-party logistics and spare part logistics were introduced, as these subjects are relevant in the case process. The information systems used in supply chain management were briefly presented too. The empirical part of the study is done by conducting a case study of a special project order that requires intercompany shipment consolidation. Several parties around the world are included in the process. Different parties were interviewed to form an understanding of the process. The process was defined utilizing a flowchart and written coverage. The definition and the interviews were used to identify the different bottlenecks and issues in the process. The problems of the process and their root causes were also assessed. A large part of the issues, such as communication problems were traceable to the rigid information systems that do not directly support such special needs of the case. The development ideas to the process were divided into short-term and long-term ideas. The short-term ideas, such as <b>consolidation</b> <b>order</b> instructions, a streamlined process and different IT-tools, were emphasized, as they could be implemented in a fast schedule from none to little costs. It was noted, that for most benefit practically all presented short-term ideas should be implemented. The long-term ideas provide more of an aspirational state and visions for future. Most notable long-term ideas relate to virtual ERP-plants, consolidation at forwarder premises and material extension to MDC or centralized warehousing. However, most long-term ideas require quite radical changes from the company...|$|E
40|$|On June 6, 2013, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation {{ordered the}} {{consolidation}} of fifteen actions filed by state attorneys general against the Standard 2 ̆ 6 Poor’s rating agency for {{its role in the}} collapse of the market for structured finance securities. The cases are important: The underlying events shook markets worldwide and contributed to a global recession, the legal actions themselves take aim at foundational aspects of the way rating agencies go about their business, and the suits threaten the imposition of significant fines and penalties against S 2 ̆ 6 P. So it is unsurprising that the order of the MDL panel—typically {{the sort of thing that}} would fly well under the radar—garnered an extraordinary measure of media attention. Many observers marked the <b>consolidation</b> <b>order</b> as a significant victory for S 2 ̆ 6 P. The Wall Street Journal, for example, characterized the decision as an “incremental but important legal victory” for the defendants and emphasized that consolidation will permit S 2 ̆ 6 P “to streamline costs and avoid a piecemeal legal battle in state courts across the country. ” Another observer deemed the decision a “big win” for S 2 ̆ 6 P and highlighted the fact that it enabled S 2 ̆ 6 P to move the suits away from the AGs’ home courts and onto (arguably) more neutral terrain. But the reality is that S 2 ̆ 6 P has won no more than a lottery ticket. It will enjoy the efficiencies associated with consolidation and keep the state AGs off of their home turf only if the judge to whom the cases have been assigned seriously misapplies federal jurisdictional law. This Essay has two principal goals. The first is to show that our jurisdictional law does not permit removal in these cases. S 2 ̆ 6 P has argued that these lawsuits are eligible for federal court jurisdiction on a federal question theory—i. e., on the ground that they “arise under” federal law within the meaning of 28 U. S. C. § 1331. I will show in Part I that these arguments are strained and ultimately unavailing. My second goal (pursued in Part II) is to show that the relevant jurisdictional law is seriously unsatisfying. The S 2 ̆ 6 P litigation raises challenging questions of jurisdictional policy, but the law as it stands simply fails to engage them. It relies instead on a pair of mechanical rules for sorting cases between the state and federal courts that have only an attenuated relationship to considerations of sound jurisdictional policy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-The {{consolidation}} of shipments into loads arises {{in a number}} of applications, including household moving, truckload trucking, rail and container operations. The capacitated clustering problem (CCP) is one of the underlying optimization problems for the efficient <b>consolidation</b> of customer <b>orders</b> to vehicle shipments. In this paper we develop optimization-based heuristic algorithms for the CCP, extending procedures developed by Mulvey and Beck, as well as algorithms developed by Fisher and Jaikumar, for the generalized assignment problem. In this paper, iterative methods are proposed that avoid the specification of “seed ” customers required by other algorithms, and which are shown to produce better solutions than existing heuristics. Lagrangian relaxations are used to develop rigorous bounds, which demonstrate the effectiveness of relatively simple heuristics. 1. OVERVIEW The efficient <b>consolidation</b> of customer <b>orders</b> into full truckload shipments is an important problem in logistics, arising in a variety of applications. The grouping of orders into full loads that will fill a truck, railcar or container must take into account not only the distance to be travelled but also service requirements in the form of pickup and deliver...|$|R

30|$|The vehicle routing {{problem with}} {{cross-docking}} was first introduced by Lee et al. (2006). The objective was minimizing the transportation and fixed costs of using vehicles and it was solved by the Tabu search algorithm. In their work products were transferred from suppliers to customers by homogeneous vehicles in the time horizon. In their model {{it was assumed that}} the vehicles must arrive to the cross-dock simultaneously for simplifying the model. Liao et al. (2010) proposed another Tabu search to solve the same problem in better computational time and less used trucks. They reported 10 – 36 % improvement in the objective function comparing to previous solution algorithm. In another work, Prince (2004) introduced a hybrid algorithm of PSO (particle swarm optimization), VNS (variable neighborhood search) and SA (simulated annealing) for solving the model and used Taguchi method for parameter tuning. The proposed algorithm leads to better results. Wen et al. (2009) considered same problem with <b>consolidation</b> which <b>orders</b> after pickup phase are consolidated at a cross-dock then immediately are delivered to customers. In <b>consolidation</b> phase, <b>orders</b> are unloaded from inbound trucks and reloaded to outbound trucks, while if a truck must deliver an order that picked it up itself, consolidation is not necessary. The goal of the model was minimizing transportation time and it was formulated as a MILP and solved by Tabu search for large instances. Musa et al. (2010) considered a transportation problem in a network of cross-docks as an extension of introduced model by Donaldson et al. (1998 a) with two types of transportation: (1) transferring from suppliers to customers directly and (2) transferring through cross-docks. They used the Ant colony algorithm to solve the problem.|$|R
