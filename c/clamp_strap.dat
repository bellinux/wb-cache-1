50|$|Rear Basket system: This {{method has}} been around for a while and allows the user to attach a tray to the back of their PWC on the landing ramp. The basket is held on by bungee <b>clamps,</b> <b>straps</b> and clips. This basket allows the {{attachment}} of steel tubes for rods and the basket allows a cooler to be installed onto the back of the machine. The basket and cooler can be an obstacle when re-boarding the jet ski.|$|R

50|$|Riggers attach {{loads of}} {{equipment}} to cranes or structures using shackles, cables, chains, <b>clamps</b> or <b>straps,</b> employing pulleys, winches, lifts or chain hoists (aka chain motors). Quick load calculations {{are necessary for}} each load and engineering principles are always in play. Riggers use various suspension techniques to get their load around obstacles on a construction site or loading dock or event site to the desired location and height.|$|R
5000|$|A {{surfboard}} lock is {{a device}} or {{a mechanism for}} securing a surfboard to prevent theft or loss. Typically surfboard locks attach to {{some part of the}} surfboard, such as the leash plug or center fin box slot. Alternately, some locking devices <b>clamp</b> or <b>strap</b> around the surfboard. Once the board is secured, the locking device attaches to some hard point like a vehicle or a non-movable object.|$|R
5000|$|Pipe {{installation}} {{is often}} {{more expensive than the}} material and a variety of specialized tools, techniques, and parts have been developed to assist this. Pipe is usually delivered to a customer or jobsite as either [...] "sticks" [...] or lengths of pipe (typically 20 feet, called single random length) or they are prefabricated with elbows, tees and valves into a prefabricated pipe spool pipe spool is a piece of pre-assembled pipe and fittings, usually prepared in a shop so that installation on the construction site can be more efficient.. Typically, pipe smaller than 2.0 inch are not pre-fabricated. The pipe spools are usually tagged with a bar code and the ends are capped (plastic) for protection. The pipe and pipe spools are delivered to a warehouse on a large commercial/industrial job and they may be held indoors or in a gridded laydown yard. The pipe or pipe spool is retrieved, staged, rigged, and then lifted into place. On large process jobs the lift is made using cranes and hoist and other material lifts. They are typically temporarily supported in the steel structure using beam <b>clamps,</b> <b>straps,</b> and small hoists until the Pipe Supports are attached or otherwise secured.|$|R
50|$|Products {{using this}} {{technology}} directly are automotive seatbelt springs, large power transformer winding strips, rotogravure plates, cable and hose <b>clamps,</b> gas tank <b>straps,</b> and window counterbalance springs. Products using the process indirectly are tubes and pipe mills where {{the edge of}} the strip is accurately beveled prior to being folded into tubular form and seam welded. The finished edges enable pinhole free welds.|$|R
50|$|The corselet, {{also known}} as a breastplate, is an oval or {{rectangular}} collar-piece resting on the shoulders, chest and back, to support the helmet and seal it to the suit, usually made from copper and brass, but occasionally steel. The helmet is usually connected to the suit by placing the holes around the rubberised collar of the suit over bolts along the rim of the corselet, and then <b>clamping</b> the brass <b>straps</b> known as brailes against the collar with wing nuts to press the rubber against the metal of the corselet rim to make a water-tight seal. An alternative method was to bolt the bonnet to the corselet over a rubber collar bonded {{to the top of the}} suit.|$|R
50|$|The process {{involves}} {{moving the}} strip past precision-profiled slotted tools made to an exact shape, or past plain cutting tools. The tools are all usually made of tungsten carbide-based compounds. In early machines, {{it was necessary}} to precisely position the strip relative to the cutting tools, but newer machines use a floating suspension technology which enables tools to locate by material contact. This allows mutual initial positioning differences up to approximately 12 mm followed by resilient automatic engagement. Products using this technology directly are automotive seatbelt springs, large power transformer winding strip, rotogravure plates, cable and hose <b>clamps,</b> gas tank <b>straps,</b> and window counterbalance springs. Products using the process indirectly are tubes and pipe mills where the edge of the strip is accurately beveled prior to being folded into tubular form and seam welded. The finished edges enable pinhole free welds.|$|R
50|$|A {{detachable}} box {{magazine is}} a self-contained mechanism {{capable of being}} loaded or unloaded while detached from the host firearm. They are attached via a slot in the firearm receiver, usually below the action but occasionally to the side (Sten, FG 42, Johnson LMG) or on top (Madsen machine gun, Bren gun, FN P90). When necessary, the magazine can easily be detached from the firearm and replaced by another. This significantly speeds the process of reloading, allowing the operator quick access to ammunition. This type of magazine may be straight or curved, the curve being necessary if the rifle uses rimmed ammunition or ammunition with a tapered case. Detachable box magazines may be metal or plastic. The plastic magazines are sometimes partially transparent so the operator can easily check the remaining ammunition. Box magazines are often affixed to each other with <b>clamps,</b> clips, tape, <b>straps,</b> or built-in studs to facilitate faster reloading: see jungle style.|$|R
5000|$|Precogs are mutants, {{identified}} talents further {{developed in}} a government-operated training school [...] - [...] for example, one precog was initially diagnosed as [...] "a hydrocephalic idiot" [...] but the precog talent was found under layers of damaged brain tissue. The precogs are kept in rigid position by metal bands, <b>clamps</b> and wiring, <b>strapping</b> them into special high-backed chairs. Their physical needs are taken care of automatically and Anderton claims {{that they have no}} spiritual needs. Their physical appearance is distorted from an ordinary human, with enlarged heads and wasted bodies. Precogs are [...] "deformed" [...] and [...] "retarded" [...] as [...] "the talent absorbs everything"; [...] "the esp-lobe shrivels the balance of the frontal area". They do not understand their predictions; only through technological and mechanical aid can their nonsense be unravelled. The data produced does not always pertain to crime or murder, but this information is then passed on to other agencies.|$|R
50|$|Ray sexually {{tortured}} and presumably killed his victims using whips, chains, pulleys, <b>straps,</b> <b>clamps,</b> leg spreader bars, surgical blades, and saws. It {{is thought that}} he terrorized many women with these tools for many years, while living in New Mexico, with the added assistance of multiple accomplices, allegedly including several of the women he was dating.Inside the torture room, along with numerous sex toys, torture implements, syringes, and detailed diagrams showing different methods and techniques for inflicting pain, there was a homemade electrical generator that was used for torture. A mirror was mounted in the ceiling, above the gynecologist-type table he used to strap his victims to. Ray would also put his victims in wooden contraptions that bent them over and immobilized them while he had his dogs rape them and sometimes other friends. He has been said to have wanted his victims to see everything he was doing to them during the torture sessions. Ray would often have a recorded audio tape of himself played for his victims whenever they regained consciousness.|$|R
