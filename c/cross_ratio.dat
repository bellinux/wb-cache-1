40|$|We {{study the}} {{two-point}} function of local operators {{in the presence}} of a defect in a generic conformal field theory. We define two pairs of <b>cross</b> <b>ratios,</b> which are convenient in the analysis of the OPE in the bulk and defect channel respectively. The new coordinates have a simple geometric interpretation, which can be exploited to efficiently compute conformal blocks in a power expansion. We illustrate this fact in the case of scalar external operators. We also elucidate the convergence properties of the bulk and defect OPE decompositions of the two-point function. In particular, we remark that the expansion of the two-point function in powers of the new <b>cross</b> <b>ratios</b> converges everywhere, a property not shared by the <b>cross</b> <b>ratios</b> customarily used in defect CFT. We comment on the crucial relevance of this fact for the numerical bootstrap. Comment: 42 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

We show several basic properties of it; including continuity, {{the connection to}} translation lengths of hyperbolic elements, and the behavior under products. Moreover, we motivate that these are suitable generalizations of <b>cross</b> <b>ratios</b> on ideal boundaries of rank one symmetric spaces, by proving that every continuous cross ratio-preserving map on the maximal Furstenberg boundary (or full flag manifold) is induced by an isometry, after multiplying metrics on de Rham factors by positive constants.

40|$|The {{infrared}} divergences of massless n-parton scattering amplitudes can {{be derived}} from the anomalous dimension of n-jet operators in soft-collinear effective theory. Up to three-loop order, the latter has been shown to have a very simple structure: it contains pairwise color-dipole interactions among the external partons, governed by the cusp anomalous dimension and a logarithm of the kinematic invariants s_{ij}, plus a possible three-loop correlation involving four particles, which is described by a yet unknown function of conformal <b>cross</b> <b>ratios</b> of kinematic invariants. This function is constrained by two-particle collinear limits and by the known behavior of amplitudes in the high-energy limit. We construct a class of relatively simple functions satisfying these constraints. We also extend the analysis to four-loop order, finding that three additional four-particle correlations and a single five-particle correlation appear, which again are governed by functions of conformal <b>cross</b> <b>ratios.</b> Our results suggest that the dipole conjecture, which states that only two-particle color-dipole correlations appear in the anomalous dimension, may need to be generalized. We present a weaker form of the conjecture, stating that to all orders in perturbation theory corrections to the dipole formula are governed by functions of conformal <b>cross</b> <b>ratios,</b> and are O(1 /N_c^ 2) suppressed relative to the dipole term. If true, this conjecture implies that the cusp anomalous dimension obeys Casimir scaling to all orders in perturbation theory. Comment: 21 pages, 1 figur...|$|R

The differential equations can be integrated numerically for generic values of the <b>cross</b> <b>ratios,</b> or analytically in certain kinematics limits, including the near-collinear and multi-Regge limits.
