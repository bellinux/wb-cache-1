To my surprise I found them in greatly increased numbers: {{on the tops of}} <b>cardoons,</b> posts, and other elevated situations they were literally lying together in heaps. Most of them were large and of the olive-coloured species; their size had probably prevented them from getting away earlier, but they were now floating off in great numbers, the weather being calm and tolerably dry. To-day I noticed a new species with a grey body, elegantly striped with black, and pink legs--a very pretty spider.|$|E
40|$|Wild <b>cardoon</b> (Cynara cardunculus L.) is a {{promising}} crop for biomass production. A nursery trial {{was conducted to}} investigate the effectiveness of mycorrhizal inoculation on the biomass yield of wild <b>cardoon</b> seedlings {{and the effect of}} the pesticides fosetyl-Al, folpet and propamocarb, as fungicides, and isofenphos, phoxim and oxamyl, as insecticides, on <b>cardoon</b> plant growth and the mycorrhization. The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi inocula were: commercial inoculum with Glomus mosseae spores, and an inoculum of a Glomus sp. strain (AMF-i) isolated locally. Mycorrhizal inoculation with either inoculum increased <b>cardoon</b> shoot biomass compared to non-inoculated control plants. The pesticide applications had a neutral or positive effect on <b>cardoon</b> seedling growth. However, the AM fungi colonisation did not decrease except for plants colonised by G. mosseae and treated with the insecticides isofenphos and oxamyl. Thus, the mycorrhiza can survive to pesticide concentrations employed in commercial nursery, and enhance <b>cardoon</b> plant productivity. vo...|$|R

The aim {{of this research was}} to evaluate the antioxidant properties of seeds from lines of artichoke and cultivated and wild <b>cardoon</b> in both aqueous-organic extracts and their residues by FRAP (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power) and TEAC (Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity) evaluations. Both artichoke and <b>cardoon</b> seeds are a good source of antioxidants. Among artichoke seeds, hydrolysable polyphenols contribution to antioxidant properties ranged from 41 % to 78 % for FRAP values and from 17 % to 37 % for TEAC values. No difference between cultivated and wild <b>cardoon</b> in antioxidant properties are reported.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{ability in}} terms of biomass, achenes, oil and energy yield of two Cynara cardunculus L. genotypes (one cultivated <b>cardoon</b> and one wild <b>cardoon)</b> was evaluated along a 7 -year experiment. It {{was carried out in}} a marginal farmland of Southern Italy, with low soil fertility and minimal external inputs. Under these conditions, they reached an annual harvestable biomass ranging from 0. 74 (wild <b>cardoon)</b> to 1. 46 kg m − 2 (cultivated <b>cardoon)</b> and an energy yield ranging from 13. 8 to 27. 5 kJ m − 2. The lower heating value of biomass (including achenes) was on average 18. 2 kJ kg − 1, while the oil yield from achenes varied between 25. 1 and 25. 7 g 100 g − 1 of dry matter. The cultivated <b>cardoon</b> was able to produce high yields until the fifth season and therefore is prone for medium long-time cropping systems. Conversely, wild <b>cardoon</b> showed a most stable yield pattern and plant survival over seasons, suggesting its particular suitability for perennial cropping systems in Mediterranean marginal areas...|$|R

Apart from the feedstock, the other differences were the gasification medium and the bed material used in each trial. The oxidizing agent at TUD׳s run was O 2 /steam, whereas CERTH׳s tests used air. When experiments with the <b>cardoon</b> 50 % w/w–giant reed 50 % w/w blend were performed no agglomeration problems were presented. Consequently, gasification could be achieved in higher temperature than that of pure <b>cardoon</b> which led to the reduction of tar concentration...|$|R

5000|$|In Europe, cardoon {{is still}} {{cultivated}} in France (Provence, Savoie, Lyonnais), Spain, and Italy.

[...] "Before <b>cardoons</b> are sent to table, the stalks or ribs are blanched tying them together and wrapping them round with straw, which is also tied up with cord, and left so for about three weeks". <b>Cardoons</b> also are common vegetables in northern Africa, often used in Algerian or Tunisian couscous.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The use {{of biomass}} fuels for energy {{production}} through combustion has a growing application worldwide mainly for two reasons: first, {{the utilization of}} biomass for energy contributes to mitigate emission of green house gases; second, its use decreases the dependence of imported fossil fuels in Europe. The objective of this work was to study the combustion behaviour of two endogenous biomass species: <b>cardoon</b> (cynara cardunculus) and arundo (arundo donax), which were specially produced in energy crops plantations. Mixtures of <b>cardoon</b> and a forestry biomass specie (eucalyptus) were also studied to evaluate potential benefits from synergies between both biomass fuel types. The {{results showed that the}} utilization of <b>cardoon,</b> in pelletized form, and loose arundo as feedstock, did not give rise to any operational problems related with the feeding system. It was verified that the mono combustion of <b>cardoon</b> could pose problems at industrial scale in fluidised bed systems, considering the high levels of HCl and NOX emissions obtained and tendency to sinter the bed sand material. The addition of the forestry biomass to <b>cardoon</b> appeared to prevent the bed agglomeration problem. Furthermore, both the NOX and SO 2 emissions were found to decrease at the same time suggesting potential synergy of blending different types of biomass regarding pollutant emissions and in bed agglomeration problems...|$|R
