There was some debate in the House of Lords, with questions and amendments <b>covering</b> <b>Section</b> 1, but the bill was not substantially amended, something North puts down {{to the quality of the}} draft prepared by the Law Commission. The Act was given the Royal Assent on 29 June 1972, and came into force on 1 January 1974.|$|E

40|$|A {{hard suit}} {{for use in}} space or diving {{applications}} having an adjustable length torso covering that will fit a large variety of wearers is described. The torso covering comprises an upper section and a lower section which interconnect so that the covering will fit wearers with short torsos. One or more sizing rings may be inserted between {{the upper and lower}} sections to accommodate larger torso sizes as required. Since access of the astronaut to the torso covering is preferably through an opening {{in the back of the}} upper section (which is closed off by the backpack), the rings slant upward-forward from the lower edge of the opening. The lower edge of the upper <b>covering</b> <b>section</b> has a coupler which slants upward-forward from the lower edge of the back opening. The lower torso section has a similarly slanted coupler which may interfit with the upper section coupler to accommodate the smallest torso size. One or more sizing rings may be inserted between the coupler sections of the upper and lower torso sections to accommodate larger torsos. Each ring has an upper coupler which may interfit with the upper section coupler and a lower coupler which may interfit with the lower section coupler...|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} {{to use in}} testing, cloze deletion {{can be used in}} learning, particularly language learning, but also learning facts. This may be done manually - for example, by <b>covering</b> <b>sections</b> of a text with paper, or highlighting sections of text with a highlighter, then covering the line with a colored ruler in the complementary color (say, a red ruler for green highlighter) so the highlighted text disappears; this is popular in Japan, for instance. Cloze deletion can also be used as part of spaced repetition software, for example the SuperMemo and Anki applications feature semi-automated creation of cloze tests.|$|R

40|$|Several {{approaches}} to truck platooning over varying road topographies are introduced, evaluated, and compared. A simple, stochastic optimization procedure {{was applied to}} the lead vehicle speed profiles (<b>covering</b> <b>sections</b> of 10 km), resulting in average lead vehicle fuel savings of around 15. 4 % relative to standard cruise control. Moreover, several models involving artificial physics were evaluated for the actual platooning, i. e. for the motion of the vehicles following the lead vehicle, with the aim of minimizing the total fuel consumption of the entire platoon. One such model, based on modified artificial gravity, was found to slightly outperform a more standard approach involving adaptive cruise control, while maintaining safety and coherence of the platoon...|$|R
