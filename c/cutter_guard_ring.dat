40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Previous work at Stanford University has {{demonstrated}} that inductance in the substrate connection is the principal problem underlying the coupling of digital switching noise into analog circuits. The low impedance substrate can {{be treated as a}} single node over a local area. Switching in the digital circuits produces current transients in the substrate. These transients are subsequently amplified in the analog portions of the overall mixed-mode circuit. Various <b>guard</b> <b>rings</b> and other techniques, including the use of new logic circuit families, have been proposed to suppress this noise. This work demonstrates that by using the capacitance of a forward biased <b>guard</b> <b>ring(s),</b> the substrate noise at a specific frequency(ies) can be reduced by resonating the <b>guard</b> <b>ring</b> capacitance with the substrate lead inductance to provide a very low substrate-to-ground impedance. In this manner, noise at particular frequencies, which are problematic to the analog circuit, can be suppressed. Tuning can be accomplished by varying the current in the forward-biased <b>guard</b> <b>ring</b> diodes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{recent work}} {{to improve the}} measurement of the stress response of materials to intense, short pulses of radiation. When Saturn fires, large prompt electrical noise pulses are induced in stress measurement circuits. The conventional wisdom {{has been that the}} shorted <b>guard</b> <b>ring</b> quartz gauge was the only configuration with acceptable prompt signal-to-noise characteristics for stress measurements in this pulsed radiation environment. However, because of abnormal signal distortion, the shorted <b>guard</b> <b>ring</b> gauge is restricted to a maximum stress of about 8 kbars. Below this level, the normal, quantified signal distortion is correctable with analytical deconvolution techniques. The shunted <b>guard</b> <b>ring</b> gauge is acceptable for Egli fidelity measurements to about 25 kbars with negligible signal distortion. Experiments were conducted on the Saturn soft x-ray source which show that higher fidelity shunted <b>guard</b> <b>ring</b> gauges can successfully measure stress with acceptable induced noise.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project is to characterise two silicon epitaxial diode types with structures differing {{with the presence of}} n+ <b>guard</b> <b>ring</b> in one type. These detectors will be evaluated and ultimately assessed on their potential as a reliable commercial detector system for newer radiation therapy modalities, with focus on its use in Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy Quality Assurance. The detectors comprise of a p+ layer as its substrate and a p-type epitaxial layer, with n+ junction implanted. One of the detector types had an n+ <b>guard</b> <b>ring</b> surrounding the diode, which was designed to minimise leakage current and limit the sensitive volume of the detector. This investigation showed that the <b>guard</b> <b>ring</b> was effective in minimising leakage current when grounded, but left unconnected greatly increased the overall detector noise and lead to a large decrease in collection efficiency. However, it was also seen that having the <b>guard</b> <b>ring</b> grounded acted as a pathway to ground for charge carriers created during incident radiation at low voltages, thus disqualifying it for use in passive mode. Comparing results with the diode without the <b>guard</b> <b>ring,</b> the latter showed a slightly higher leakage current, but overall higher collection efficiency and a low depletion voltage, thus it was more suitable {{to be used as a}} during a clinical setting. Clinical irradiations showed that the detector is dose rate independent across the range between 50 and 600 MU/min, it shows a linear response to dose over the range of 0 to 100 MU and a depth dose profile congruent with results produced by ion chamber measurements. It was therefore concluded that the detector without the <b>guard</b> <b>ring</b> was the most suitable option for measurements of IMRT radiation therapy...|$|R
