25|$|A contact {{microphone}} picks up vibrations {{directly from a}} solid surface or object, as opposed to sound vibrations carried through air. One use for this is to detect sounds of a very low level, such as those from small objects or insects. The microphone commonly consists of a magnetic (moving coil) transducer, contact plate and <b>contact</b> <b>pin.</b> The contact plate is placed directly on the vibrating part of a musical instrument or other surface, and the <b>contact</b> <b>pin</b> transfers vibrations to the coil. Contact microphones {{have been used to}} pick up the sound of a snail's heartbeat and the footsteps of ants. A portable version of this microphone has recently been developed. A throat microphone is a variant of the {{contact microphone}} that picks up speech directly from a person's throat, which it is strapped to. This lets the device be used in areas with ambient sounds that would otherwise make the speaker inaudible.|$|E

50|$|MC4 {{connectors}} are single-contact electrical connectors {{commonly used}} for connecting solar panels. MC4 {{stands for the}} manufacturer Multi-Contact (currently St√§ubli Electrical Connectors) and a 4 for the 4mm (diameter) <b>contact</b> <b>pin.</b> MC4s allow strings of panels to be easily constructed by pushing the connectors from adjacent panels together by hand, but require a tool to disconnect them to ensure they do not accidentally disconnect when the cables are pulled. The MC4 and compatible products are universal in the solar market today, equipping almost all solar panels produced since about 2011. Originally rated for 600 V, most versions since are rated to 1000 V, which allows longer strings to be created.|$|E
50|$|SQ-A: Introduced January 1982, {{production}} discontinued December 1991. The SQ-A was a refinement of the SQ. The <b>contact</b> <b>pin</b> array for the viewfinder was increased {{from six to}} ten gold contacts, allowing for auto metering capability with the AE finder S. Also, a mirror lock-up lever was added. The film-backs were modified slightly, with the ISO dial for the original film-backs having white and orange numerals, and the new with silver. The darkslide was changed to the locking style; to lock required both the new grey handle slide and the new silver numeral ISO dial back. All accessories for SQ cameras fit the SQ-A, however the AE finder cannot physically mount on the SQ; a safety defeat pin prevents attachment.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{efficient}} means to reduce arcing time is to use an arc eliminator that will extinguish the arc within a few milliseconds. The arc eliminator operates in 1-4 ms and creates a 3-phase short-circuit on {{another part of the}} system, typically upstream at higher voltages. This device contains a fast <b>contact</b> <b>pin</b> that upon activation by an external relay, makes physical contact with the energized bus which then creates the short-circuit. The arc eliminator will protect a human if they are {{standing in front of the}} arc flash event and the relays detect the arc flash by diverting the arc flash to another location, although the diversion may cause a system failure at the location the short-circuit was diverted to. These devices must be replaced after an operation.|$|E
50|$|Some camera bodies, {{including}} all Canon EOS bodies {{and the more}} budget-oriented among Nikon's DX models, do not include an autofocus motor and therefore cannot autofocus with lenses that lack an inbuilt motor.

5000|$|A {{semiconductor}} {{package is}} a metal, plastic, glass or ceramic casing containing {{one or more}} semiconductor electronic components.

50|$|The Pentax K-F mount added five {{electrical}} <b>contact</b> <b>pins</b> protruding {{through the}} lens mount flange at the 5 o'clock position (when viewing the ME F body from the front) to the original Pentax K mount (introduced 1975) to pass focus control information between the camera and the lens. The Pentax K-AF and K-AF2 autofocus lens mounts (introduced 1987 and 1991, respectively) have contacts of different number, position and function, and therefore the 35mm-70mm AF Zoom cannot autofocus on any other Pentax SLR.|$|R
