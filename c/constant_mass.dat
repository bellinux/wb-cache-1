25|$|<b>Constant</b> <b>mass</b> flow {{addition}} valves {{are used}} to supply a <b>constant</b> <b>mass</b> flow of fresh gas to an active type semi-closed rebreather to replenish the gas used by the diver and to maintain an approximately constant composition of the loop mix. Two main types are used: the fixed orifice and the adjustable orifice (usually a needle valve). The <b>constant</b> <b>mass</b> flow valve is usually based on a gas regulator that is isolated from the ambient pressure so that it provides an absolute pressure regulated output (not compensated for ambient pressure). This limits the depth range in which <b>constant</b> <b>mass</b> flow is possible through the orifice, but provides a relatively predictable gas mixture in the breathing loop. An over-pressure relief valve {{in the first stage}} is used to protect the output hose. Unlike most other diving regulators, these do not control the downstream pressure, but they do regulate the flow rate.|$|E
25|$|Diving {{regulators}} use mechanically operated valves. In {{most cases}} there is ambient pressure feedback to both {{first and second}} stage, except where this is avoided to allow <b>constant</b> <b>mass</b> flow through an orifice in a rebreather, which requires a constant upstream pressure.|$|E
25|$|Cubic {{feet per}} minute (CFM) is an often {{confusing}} term {{because it has}} no single definition that applies to all instances. Gases are compressible, which means that a figure in cubic feet per minute cannot necessarily be compared with another figure when it comes {{the mass of the}} gas. To further confuse the issue, a centrifugal fan is a constant CFM device or a constant volume device. This means that, provided the fan speed remains constant, a centrifugal fan will pump a constant volume of air. This {{is not the same as}} pumping a <b>constant</b> <b>mass</b> of air. Again, the fan will pump the same volume, though not mass, at any other air density. This means that the air velocity in a system is the same even though mass flow rate through the fan is not.|$|E

25|$|In a closed-circuit rebreather {{the oxygen}} partial {{pressure}} in the rebreather is controlled, {{so it can be}} maintained at a safe continuous maximum, which reduces the inert gas (nitrogen and/or helium) partial {{pressure in the}} breathing loop. Minimising the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues for a given dive profile reduces the decompression obligation. This requires continuous monitoring of actual partial pressures with time and for maximum effectiveness requires real-time computer processing by the diver's decompression computer. Decompression can be much reduced compared to fixed ratio gas mixes used in other scuba systems and, as a result, divers can stay down longer or require less time to decompress. A semi-closed circuit rebreather injects a <b>constant</b> <b>mass</b> flow of a fixed breathing gas mixture into the breathing loop, or replaces a specific percentage of the respired volume, so the partial pressure of oxygen {{at any time during the}} dive depends on the diver's oxygen consumption and/or breathing rate. Planning decompression requirements requires a more conservative approach for a SCR than for a CCR, but decompression computers with a real time oxygen partial pressure input can optimise decompression for these systems.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that the distribution {{function of the}} masses of young star clusters is universal and can be purely interpreted as a probability density distribution function with a <b>constant</b> upper <b>mass</b> limit. As {{a result of this}} picture the masses of the most-massive objects are exclusively determined {{by the size of the}} sample. Here we show, with very high confidence, that the masses of the most-massive young star clusters in M 33 decrease with increasing galactocentric radius in contradiction to the expectations from a model of a randomly sampled <b>constant</b> cluster <b>mass</b> function with a <b>constant</b> upper <b>mass</b> limit.

60|$|The night, {{though we}} were so little past midsummer, was as dark as January. Intervals of a groping {{twilight}} alternated with spells of utter blackness; and {{it was impossible to}} trace the reason of these changes in the flying horror of the sky. The wind blew the breath out of a man's nostrils; all heaven seemed to thunder overhead like one huge sail; and when there fell a momentary lull on Aros, we could hear the gusts dismally sweeping in the distance. Over all the lowlands of the Ross the wind must have blown as fierce as on the open sea; and God only knows the uproar that was raging around the head of Ben Kyaw. Sheets of mingled spray and rain were driven in our faces. All round the isle of Aros the surf, with an incessant, hammering thunder, beat upon the reefs and beaches. Now louder in one place, now lower in another, like the combinations of orchestral music, the <b>constant</b> <b>mass</b> of sound was hardly varied for a moment. And loud above all this hurly-burly I could hear the changeful voices of the Roost and the intermittent roaring of the Merry Men. At that hour, there flashed into my mind the reason of the name that they were called. For the noise of them seemed almost mirthful, as it out-topped the other noises of the night; or if not mirthful, yet instinct with a portentous joviality. Nay, and it seemed even human. As when savage men have drunk away their reason, and, discarding speech, bawl together in their madness by the hour; so, to my ears, these deadly breakers shouted by Aros in the night.|$|E

These binaries would certainly be among the strongest sources of sinusoidal gravitational waves.
