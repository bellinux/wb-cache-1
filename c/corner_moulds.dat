50|$|The former Waits River School {{building}} {{is located in}} the rural village of Waits River, a short way west of the West Topsham United Methodist Church {{on the north side of}} Vermont Route 25. It is a two story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and clapboarded exterior. A 2-1/2 story gabled section projects from the center of the front facade, with the main entrance at its base. The entry is slightly off-center, and is sheltered by a gabled porch supported by square posts. The exterior is relatively unadorned, its massing, slender <b>corner</b> <b>moulding,</b> and partial gable returns the only major indicators of its Colonial Revival style. The interior is more elaborate, and is reflective of an evolutionary history dictated by changing state requirements for school building standards.|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the influences of a high frequency (30 kHz) alternating current on the uniformity of the magnetic field (B) in an electromagnetic casting (EMC) mould is investigated by means of parametric numerical simulations where the induction current (Js) varies {{in the range of}} [1 to 10000 A]. The results show that values of the magnetic flux density along the casting direction (Bz) near the square <b>mould</b> <b>corners</b> are small, compared to those at the other locations where Js < 10000 A, and that the magnitude of Bz increases with an increased induction current (Js). However, it is shown that, for the EMC mould structure investigated in this paper, the variations of Js have no significant influences on the uniformity of the magnetic field, especially for the regions near molten steel level. Moreover, the effective acting region (Rbz) for the critical magnetic field (Bzc) is first introduced in this paper, which opens an interesting topic for future research...|$|R
40|$|Self-consolidating {{concrete}} (SCC), {{also called}} self-compacting concrete, was first developed {{almost two decades}} ago. It does not require compaction to achieve good consolidation and {{is becoming more and}} more commonly used in many parts of the world. However, SCC is not the same as high-workability concrete; a SCC is a high-workability concrete, but a high-workability concrete is not necessarily a SCC. For a high-workability concrete to be qualified as a SCC, it has to be able to flow through narrow gaps and fill up far-reaching <b>corners</b> in the <b>mould</b> under its own weight, pass through closely spaced reinforcing bars, and remain homogeneous after flowing or dropping a certain distance or through obstacles. In other words, a SCC should have, apart from high workability, also high filling ability, passing ability and segregation stability. This paper introduces some new test methods for measuring the performance of SCC, recommends the performance criteria that may be adopted for different grades of SCC, and presents a laboratory study on the production of SCC using the locally available materials. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The {{well known}} problem {{of global warming}} due to the green house effect has {{provoked}} the Kyoto Protocol, which calls for a reduction of the CO 2 -emission, which first of all means energy saving. In colder regions the highest amount of energy is consumed by the heating of buildings. Beside a better insulation the diminishment of ventilation losses is a common way for saving energy. Unfortunately this {{increases the risk of}} mould growth. This mould growth is determined by the temperature and relative humidity of the inner wall surface. Because people have no feeling for inside rel. humidity, an appropriate ventilation system has to prevent surface conditions suited for mould. For energy saving purposes a permanent ventilation is no acceptable solution. Instead the ventilation has to take place subjected to unsteady humidification processes like cooking or bathing. The measurement of the surface temperature and humidity to control the ventilation is too expensive and needs continuous maintenance of the sensing elements. Instead the proposed innovative control system uses a thermal bridge, which is designed in such a way, that there dew water occurs just at the same time, when in problematic spaces like <b>corners</b> conditions for <b>mould</b> have been reached. The thermal bridge is equipped with a dew point switch switching the ventilator. Just when the condensation has stopped and the surface of this dew point switch has dried the ventilator will be deactivated. This ensures that the ventilation occurs only when required. Additional advantages are the simplicity and cheapness of this system combined with the lack of necessary service...|$|R
40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{composite}} manufacturing process that would be able to deliver Class A surface finished products in the context of mould manufacturing methods. The problem required solving was to overcome the time needed to prepare Class A surfaces, by developing a composite manufacturing process that will deliver Class A surface finished products straight from the mould. The process was aimed at the entire development process, from mould and plug design up to the finished product. A literature study and a factory mould survey were conducted with a view to obtain the necessary insights into surface finishing and composite manufacturing. These surveys were followed by seven constructional tests which determined the most appropriate solutions for the proposed manufacturing processes. Test 1 was used to determine a quality finish standard for composites from the sanding grits used to finished composite surfaces versus surface roughness values used in other industries. The standard determined that a P 800 finish has a roughness between 0. 200 and 0. 150 um and constitutes a Class A 3 finish. P 1000 to P 1200 have a roughness between 0. 150 um to 0. 100 um and constitutes a Class A 2 finish. Finally a P 2000 and higher have a roughness of 0. 100 um and lower and constitutes Class A 1 surface finish. After the standard was set, the tests for finishing of the moulds, plugs and parts commenced. Test 2 was conducted on the CNC manufacturing of plugs out of Nuceron 651 tooling board. Tool path parameters were varied in a matrix. The samples with the best surface finish value were cut with a step-over of 0. 5 and feed of 800 mm/min. These parameters were found to be the most influential. Test 2 and 4 revealed that the plug surface finishing should commence with conventional 2 K paint finishing, with a possibility of acrylic split surface. This process produced projected mould surfaces between 0. 150 um and 0. 200 um, which can be categorised as Class A- 3. Test 5 and 6 determined methods for improving the mould surface quality and durability. It was established that the tooling gelcoat should be applied whilst being heated and backed with at least two layers of glass veil and a steady increase of GSM of structural glass fibres to prevent print-through. Test 3 determined that the <b>mould</b> <b>corners</b> could be strengthened with rovings pressed into the corner. It was also established that the moulds surfaces will require finishing after demoulding. The final moulds were manufactured from a fibreglass composite structure with tooling gelcoat surface. A number of guidelines and a set process were developed in order to produce moulds with a surface finish of average 0. 9 um, equivalent to Class A 1. Release agents were tested in Test 7, and the Loctite Frekote 770 -NC release system was deemed appropriate for use with In Mould Coating (IMC) of 2 K Paint. These elements were all synthesised into plug, mould and part manufacturing processes. The proposed processes were validated by the manufacturing of a JS instrument panel, which delivered a Class A 2, 0. 175 um, finish with IMC of 2 K paint. With only a minor sanding of P 3000 grit and polishing, the part was made into a Class A 1 surface, measured at 0. 63 um. The study proved that it is possible to produce Class A finished part with IMC. This method can provide a solution aimed at the elimination of P 600 and lower finishing of composite parts manufactured with IMC. Master...|$|R
