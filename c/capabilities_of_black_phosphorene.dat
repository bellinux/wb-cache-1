The potential parameters were obtained by conducting unbiased global optimization with respect to a set of reference data generated by extensive ab initio calculations. We extend ReaxFF by adding a 60 correction term which significantly improves the description of phosphorus clusters.

30|$|Two-dimensional (2 D) materials, {{graphene}} and silicene, {{are currently}} {{the subject of}} intense theoretical and experimental research especially for their novel electronic device applications [1, 2]. Graphene and silicene have demonstrated many exquisite phenomena originating from the characteristic conical dispersion and chiral behavior of their valence and conduction bands around the Fermi level [3, 4]. Generally speaking, the nanostructures of graphene and silicene such as nanoribbons, nanotubes, and their interconnections have opened new routes for experimental and theoretical studies {{in the field of}} nanoelectronics [5].

40|$|Based on {{extensive}} first principle calculations, {{we explore}} the thickness dependent effective di- electric constant and slab polarizability <b>of</b> few layer <b>black</b> <b>phosphorene.</b> We {{find that the}} dielectric constant in ultra-thin phosphorene is thickness dependent {{and it can be}} further tuned by applying an out of plane electric field. The decreasing dielectric constant with reducing number of layers of phosphorene, is a direct consequence of the lower permittivity of the surface layers and the in- creasing surface to volume ratio. We also show that the slab polarizability depends linearly on the number of layers, implying a nearly constant polarizability per phosphorus atom. Our calculation of the thickness and electric field dependent dielectric properties will be useful for designing and interpreting transport experiments in gated phosphorene devices, wherever electrostatic effects such as capacitance, charge screening etc. are important.

We also explore the behaviour of the energy gap versus the nanoribbon width $W$. Our findings demonstrate that band gap of armchair BPNs scale as $ 1 /W^ 2 $, while zigzag BPNs exhibit a $ 1 /W$ tendency. We analyse the different possible combinations of the zigzag edges that result two-fold degenerate and non-degenerate edge states.
