40|$|Pathological {{activation}} of the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) is caused by thyroid stimulating antibodies in patients with Graves’ disease or by somatic and rare genomic mutations that enhance constitutive {{activation of}} the receptor influencing both G protein and non-G protein signaling. Potential selective small molecule antagonists represent novel therapeutic compounds for abrogation of such abnormal TSHR signaling. In this study we describe the identification and in-vitro characterization of a novel small molecule antagonist by high-throughput screening (HTS). The identification of the TSHR antagonist was performed using a transcription-based TSH inhibition bioassay. TSHR expressing CHO cells which also expressed a luciferase tagged CRE response element were optimized using bovine TSH as the activator in a 384 well plate format which had a Z score of 0. 3 - 0. 6. Using this HTS assay we screened a diverse library of ~ 80, 000 compounds at a final concentration of 16. 7 μM. The selection criteria for a positive hit {{were based on a}} mean signal threshold of  50 % inhibition of control TSH stimulation. The screening resulted in 450 positive hits giving a hit ratio of 0. 56 %. A secondary <b>confirmation</b> <b>screen</b> against TSH and forskolin - a post receptor activator of adenylyl cyclase – confirmed one TSHR-specific candidate antagonist molecule (named VA-K- 14). This lead molecule had an IC 50 of 12. 3 µM and a unique chemical structure. A parallel analysis for cell viability indicated that the lead inhibitor was non-cytotoxic at its effective concentrations. In-silico docking studies performed using a TSHR transmembrane model showed the hydrophobic contact locations and the possible mode of inhibition of TSHR signaling. Furthermore, this molecule was capable of inhibiting TSHR stimulation by Graves’ disease patient sera and monoclonal stimulating TSHR antibodies. In conclusion, we report the identification of a novel small molecule TSHR inhibitor which {{has the potential to be}} developed as a therapeutic antagonist for abrogation of TSHR signaling by TSHR autoantibodies in Graves’ disease...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} application of computer science methodologies, techniques, and technologies to citizen science. Citizen science can be broadly defined as scientific research performed in part or in whole by volunteers who are not professional scientists. Such projects are increasingly making use of mobile and Internet technologies and social networking systems to collect or categorize data, and to coordinate efforts with other participants. The dissertation focuses on observations and experiences from the design, deployment, and testing of a citizen science project, Creek Watch. Creek Watch is a collaboration between an HCI research group and a government agency. The project allows anyone with an iPhone to submit photos and observations of their local waterways to authorities who use the data for water management, environmental programs, and cleanup events. The first version of Creek Watch was designed by a user-centered iterative design method, in collaboration with scientists who need data on waterways. As a result, the data collected by Creek Watch is useful to scientists and water authorities, while the App is usable by untrained novices. Users of Creek Watch submit reports on their local creek, stream, or other water body that include simple observations about water level, water flow rate, and trash. Observations are automatically time stamped and GPS tagged. Reports are submitted to a database at creekwatch. org, where scientists {{and members of the}} public alike can view reports and download data. The deployment of Creek Watch provided several lessons in the launch of an international citizen science mobile App. Subsequent versions of the iPhone App solved emergent problems with data quality by providing international translations, an instructional walk-through, and a <b>confirmation</b> <b>screen</b> for first-time submissions. This dissertation further examines how social networks can be used for recruitment and promotion of a crowdsourced citizen science project and compares this recruiting method to the use of traditional media channels. Results are presented from a series of campaigns to promote Creek Watch, including a press release with news pickups, a participation campaign through local organizations, and a social networking campaign through Facebook and Twitter. This dissertation also presents results from the trial of a feature that allows users to post Creek Watch reports automatically to Facebook or Twitter. Social networking was a worthwhile avenue for increasing awareness of the project, which increased the conversion rate from browsers to participants. The Facebook and Twitter campaign increased participation and was a better recruitment strategy than the participation campaign. However, targeting existing communities resulted in the largest increase in data submissions...|$|E
40|$|Inflammation {{is one of}} the first, most {{important}} responses of the immune system when presented with infection and is mediated primarily by eicosanoids and cytokines. The goal of this research was to generate monoclonal antibodies against murine IL 17 C, a poorly characterized cytokine involved in inflammation and linked to inflammatory conditions. The antibodies generated were then screened for their ability to block the interaction between IL 17 Cm and its receptor, IL 17 RE, or to bind IL 17 Cm without blocking this interaction. Three sets of mice were immunized with IL 17 Cm and various immunomodulators and screened for antibody titer development. The mice numbered 18447 - 18550 were sacrificed and their secondary lymphoid organs were used for a hybridoma fusion. The supernatants of the viable, antibody-producing hybridomas were screened for neutralization and the cells were frozen. There were 12 samples from the fusion (# 346) that were determined to produce anti-IL 17 Cm antibodies. Supernatant samples 1 and 9 showed potential neutralizing ability while 1, 11, 21, and 36 demonstrated activity characteristic of non-blocking antibodies. Purification of the supernatants by cloning and further <b>confirmation</b> <b>screening</b> must be done to validate these results; however, the antibodies produced look promising for future proof of concept studies and as assay reagents for further research into IL 17 C and its receptor...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{describes}} work {{conducted to}} enable Robot Scientist Eve to autonomously evaluate drug-like chemicals during high throughput experiments. Eve tests libraries of chemical compounds against yeast-based targets expressing parasite and host (human) proteins (i. e. DHFR, NMT & PGK); the parasites {{included in this}} study are responsible for an array of neglected tropical diseases. The raw data for yeast growth curves from an initial screen were evaluated, and decision tree rules were constructed to describe the relative activity and toxicity of compounds. These rules were verified, and versions were subsequently developed for application to routine mass and <b>confirmation</b> <b>screens.</b> Consequently, many potential lead drug-like candidates have been identified in the Maybridge Hitfinder library; several compounds from an approved drug library (the Johns Hopkins Clinical Compound Library) have also been confirmed as exhibiting activity against these yeast-based targets. Further in vivo study of some JHCCL compounds is in progress using extracted parasite proteins; preliminary results indicate the potential for repositioning Triclosan and Tnp- 470 as having anti-malarial behaviour based on their interaction with Plasmodium sp. DHFR proteins. In {{the second phase of the}} programme, a prototype Active Learning strategy was applied (active k-optimisation) to partial mass screen data as a seed; this allowed Eve to select compounds by assessing and predicting quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR) between seed and unknown compounds. Simulations of learning and testing QSAR cycles showed that Eve would be able to select active compounds more efficiently under such a regime. Other strategies have been developed that further improve selection efficiency for active compounds, and also promote the ability to find rare category compounds. An econometric model has been developed to demonstrate the potential beneficial impact of Active Learning strategies on the execution costs for such screens...|$|R

40|$|Shigella flexneri is a gram-negative enteropathogen that infects {{the human}} colonic epithelium. It is {{estimated}} that Shigella spp. infect 165 million people a year worldwide. Symptoms of shigellosis include bloody dysentery, dehydration, and ultimately death if the infection is not treated properly. The current recommended first-line treatment for shigellosis is ciprofloxacin; however, many new multi-drug resistant strains of Shigella have begun to emerge. The emergence of these strains, along {{with the lack of}} novel antibiotics in the drug pipeline, makes the need for new effective treatments for shigellosis a priority. Genetic knockout studies have shown that VirF, the main transcriptional activator of the Shigella pathogenesis cascade, is necessary for virulence, but not bacterial viability. We hypothesized that a novel anti-virulence therapy for shigellosis could be developed through the inhibition of VirF. To identify inhibitors of VirF, we performed a high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign testing over 140, 000 small molecules and 20, 000 natural product extracts using a Shigella-based, VirF-driven, β-galactosidase reporter assay. Following a series of <b>confirmation</b> <b>screens,</b> we identified five compounds from the HTS campaign that had VirF inhibitory properties. Using tissue culture-based models of the S. flexneri infection process, we were able to show that three of compounds were able to attenuate the virulence of S. flexneri, thereby, validating VirF as a target for the treatment of shigellosis. To further characterize the hits from the HTS campaign a series of established in vitro assays were adapted and optimized for VirF. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay and a fluorescence polarization assay were used to monitor VirF binding to the virB promoter, and a fluorescence intercalator displacement assay was used to determine if the hits could directly bind DNA. Using these assays, we were able to determine the mechanism of inhibition (blockade of VirF binding to the virB promoter) and preliminary structure-activity relationship trends for one of the hits, and report the first dissociation constant for VirF binding to the virB promoter (2. 8 ± 1. 0 μM) ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>confirmation</b> of {{positive}} <b>screening</b> assay reactions for antibodies to {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (anti-HIV- 1) by Western blot is expensive and often gives indeterminate results. We therefore carried out a collaborative study to investigate the <b>confirmation</b> of <b>screening</b> assay reactions using a second screening assay. For this purpose, seven laboratories prospectively tested sequential specimens, using at least one additional screening assay, until about 50 confirmed anti-HIV- 1 -positive specimens had been identified in each test centre. The reactions of 16 assays were analysed in pairs (assay A and assay B), using assay B on specimens reactive in assay A: A+/B+ reactions were considered positive and A-, negative anti-HIV results. These outcomes were compared with those obtained using confirmatory Western blot. In all, 7950 specimens were tested, and 359 were reported as positive by the laboratories. Within the test centres, eight screening assay pairings gave rise to no false-positive or false-negative results, and these combinations were at least as accurate as a single screening assay followed by Western blot. From 6. 3 % to 8. 3 % of the Western blot results were indeterminate. The number of specimens examined {{was too small to}} justify recommending for general use named pairs of screening assays; the choice of these would, in any case, depend on local conditions. However, individual laboratory managers may wish to investigate the large potential savings to be made by confirming HIV infection using a second screening assay on initially reactive specimens.

The advantage of this approach over others previously described is that, in the present case, the sample passes through the chromatographic column only when the confirmatory GC-MS is used. For the MS screening method, the chromatographic column is bypassed by using an appropriate selection valve.

In the United States, HCC is the ninth leading cause of cancer deaths. Despite advances in prevention techniques, screening, and new technologies in both diagnosis and treatment, incidence and mortality continue to rise. Cirrhosis remains the most important risk factor for the development of HCC regardless of etiology. Hepatitis B and C are independent risk factors for the development of cirrhosis. Alcohol consumption remains an important additional risk factor in the United States as alcohol abuse is five times higher than hepatitis C. Diagnosis is confirmed without pathologic <b>confirmation.</b> <b>Screening</b> includes both radiologic tests, such as ultrasound, computerized tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, and serological markers such as α-fetoprotein at 6 -month intervals. Multiple treatment modalities exist; however, only orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) or surgical resection is curative. OLT is available for patients who meet or are downstaged into the Milan or University of San Francisco criteria. Additional treatment modalities include transarterial chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection, cryoablation, radiation therapy, systemic chemotherapy, and molecularly targeted therapies. Selection of a treatment modality is based on tumor size, location, extrahepatic spread, and underlying liver function. HCC is an aggressive cancer that occurs in the setting of cirrhosis and commonly presents in advanced stages. HCC can be prevented if there are appropriate measures taken, including hepatitis B virus vaccination, universal screening of blood products, use of safe injection practices, treatment and education of alcoholics and intravenous drug users, and initiation of antiviral therapy. Continued improvement in both surgical and nonsurgical approaches has demonstrated significant benefits in overall survival. While OLT remains the only curative surgical procedure, the shortage of available organs precludes this therapy for many patients with HCC.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the South American camelids' (SAC) susceptibility to BTV- 8 infection, {{their role in}} the epidemiology of the disease, and the use of currently available serological screening tests in SAC in an endemic region. ANIMALS: Three hundred and fifty-four unvaccinated and 27 vaccinated SAC (170 llamas, 201 alpacas), ranging in age from 1 month to 17 years between June and August 2008. The SAC originated from 44 herds throughout the country, representing 10 % of the Swiss SAC population. METHODS: Prospective, observational study of a convenience sample of SAC.

40|$|Background & objectives: Microdeletion syndromes are {{characterized}} by small (< 5 Mb) chromosomal deletions in which one or more genes are involved. These are frequently associated with multiple congenital anomalies. The phenotype {{is the result of}} haploinsufficiency of genes in the critical interval. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique is commonly used for precise genetic diagnosis of microdeletion syndromes. This study was conducted to assess the role of FISH in the diagnosis of suspected microdeletion syndrome. Methods: FISH was carried out on 301 clinically suspected microdeletion syndrome cases for the confirmation of clinical diagnosis using non-commercial probes. Of these, 177 cases were referred for 22 q 11. 2 microdeletion, 42 cases were referred for William syndrome, 38 cases were referred for Prader Willi/Angelman and 44 cases were referred for other suspected microdeletion syndromes. Results: FISH was confirmatory in 23 cases only (7. 6 %). There were 17 cases of 22 q 11. 2 microdeletion, four cases of Prader Willi syndrome and two cases of William syndrome. Interpretation & conclusion: We conclude that FISH should not be the method of choice for clinically suspected microdeletion syndromes. We propose to follow strict clinical criteria for FISH testing or preferably to follow better methods (genotype first approach).

40|$|BACKGROUND: In Drosophila, {{the early}} {{secretory}} apparatus comprises discrete paired Golgi stacks {{in close proximity}} to exit sites from the endoplasmic reticulum (tER sites), thus forming tER-Golgi units. Although many components involved in secretion have been identified, the structural components sustaining its organisation are less known. Here we set out to identify novel ER resident proteins involved in the of tER-Golgi unit organisation. RESULTS: To do so, we designed a novel screening strategy combining a bioinformatics pre-selection with an RNAi screen. We first selected 156 proteins exhibiting known or related ER retention/retrieval signals from a list of proteins predicted to have a signal sequence. We then performed a microscopy-based primary and <b>confirmation</b> RNAi <b>screen</b> in Drosophila S 2 cells directly scoring the organisation of the tER-Golgi units. We identified 49 hits, most of which leading to an increased number of smaller tER-Golgi units (MG for "more and smaller Golgi") upon depletion. 16 of them were validated and characterised, showing that this phenotype was not due to an inhibition in secretion, a block in G 2, or ER stress. Interestingly, the MG phenotype was often accompanied by an increase in the cell volume. Out of 6 proteins, 4 were localised to the ER. CONCLUSIONS: This work has identified novel proteins involved in the organisation of the Drosophila early secretory pathway. It contributes to the effort of assigning protein functions to gene annotation in the secretory pathway, and analysis of the MG hits revealed an enrichment of ER proteins. These results suggest a link between ER localisation, aspects of cell metabolism and tER-Golgi structural organisation. ...|$|R
40|$|Screening {{tests for}} drugs of abuse are {{regularly}} {{used in the}} clinical routine. These tests identify the targeted substances very differently if tests from different manufacturers are used and sometimes also react positive after the intake of drugs which are {{not intended to be}} detected. Therefore, implausible results have to be questioned. A test result can be falsely negative, if a patient has taken a compound which is not detected by the antibody used in the test system. Chromatographic <b>confirmation</b> and <b>screening</b> assays are more laborious to perform and more demanding for the interpretation and are therefore only offered by several specialized clinical laboratories. However, their specificity is excellent and many different compounds can be detected depending on the number of compounds which are part of the mass spectra library used. If the clinical evaluation results in the differential diagnosis of an acute intoxication, screening tests for drugs of abuse can help to identify a single compound or a group of substances. The clinical picture, however, can usually not been explained by a qualitative test result. In addition, there are no published data demonstrating that these tests meaningfully influence triage, treatment, diagnosis or further therapy of a poisoned patient. The quantitative determination of specific compounds in the blood allows for example an appraisal of the prognosis and helps to indicate a specific therapy after intake of acetaminophen or methanol.

Results Tracing of family members was the most cost effective strategy (£ 3097 (& 5066, 4479) per life year gained) as 2. 6 individuals need to be screened to identify one case {{at a cost of}} £ 133 per case detected. If the genetic mutation was known within the family then the cost per life year gained (£ 4914) was only slightly increased by genetic confirmation of the diagnosis. Universal population screening was least cost effective (£ 13 029 per life year gained) as 1365 individuals need to be screened at a cost of £ 9754 per case detected. For each strategy it was more cost effective to screen younger people and women. Targeted strategies were more expensive per person screened, but the cost per case detected was lower. Population screening of 16 year olds only was as cost effective as family tracing (£ 2777 with a clinical <b>confirmation).</b> Conclusions <b>Screening</b> family members of people with familial hypercholesterolaemia is the most cost effective option for detecting cases across the whole population...|$|R
40|$|Most {{studies on}} the {{structure}} of DNA in telomeres have been dedicated to the double-stranded region or the guanosine-rich strand and consequently {{little is known about the}} factors that may bind to the telomere cytosine-rich (C-rich) strand. This led us to investigate whether proteins exist that can recognise C-rich sequences. We have isolated several nuclear factors from human cell extracts that specifically bind the C-rich strand of vertebrate telomeres [namely a d(CCCTAA) n repeat] with high affinity and bind double-stranded telomeric DNA with a 100 × reduced affinity. A biochemical assay allowed us to characterise four proteins of apparent molecular weights 66 – 64, 45 and 35 kDa, respectively. To identify these polypeptides we screened a λgt 11 -based cDNA expression library, obtained from human HeLa cells using a radiolabelled telomeric oligonucleotide as a probe. Two clones were purified and sequenced: the first corresponded to the hnRNP K protein and the second to the ASF/SF 2 splicing factor. <b>Confirmation</b> of the <b>screening</b> results was obtained with recombinant proteins, both of which bind to the human telomeric C-rich strand in vitro...|$|R
40|$|During today's presentations, we {{have heard}} about {{existing}} and new technologies that can expand the scope of newborn and genetic screening. My role as a genetic counselor in this sphere involves assisting individuals and families as they go {{through the process of}} <b>confirmation</b> of some <b>screening</b> results, follow-up care, and family adjustment. In addition, I counsel families who are making decisions about DNAbased carrier testing, a group facing concerns illustrative of many important issues in expanded population genetic screening. I would like to present some thoughts about the evolution of these roles as screening expands. These ideas will touch on family and societal issues, public policy concerns, education, and provision of genetic services. As {{we have heard}}, new molecular screening techniques can identify not only affected individuals, but also carriers of an increasing number of genetic conditions. These techniques must be applied {{in such a way as}} to provide information in a maximally beneficial fashion. For example, early diagnosis of cystic fibrosis would allow early therapeutic intervention, thus maximizing outcome for the patient. ...|$|R
40|$|Toxoplasma gondii {{critically}} {{relies on}} cell invasion as a survival strategy to evade immune clearance during infection. Although {{it was widely}} thought that Toxoplasma entry is parasite directed and that the host cell is largely a passive victim, recent {{studies have suggested that}} host components such as microfilaments and microtubules indeed contribute to entry. Hence to identify additional host factors, we performed a high-throughput siRNA screen of a human siRNA library targeting druggable proteins using a novel inducible luciferase based invasion assay. The top 100 hits from the primary screen that showed the strongest decreases in invasion were subjected to <b>confirmation</b> by secondary <b>screening,</b> revealing 24 proteins that are potentially involved in Toxoplasma entry into host cells. Interestingly, 6 of the hits appear to affect parasite invasion by modifying host cell actin dynamics, resulting in increased deposition of F-actin at the periphery of the cell. These findings support the emerging notion that host actin dynamics are important for Toxoplasma invasion along with identifying several novel host factors that potentially participate in parasite entry...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of three mass spectrometry (MS) analyzers (triple quadrupole, QqQ; time of flight, TOF; and quadrupole time of flight, QTOF) {{has been investigated}} and compared for quantification, <b>confirmation</b> and <b>screening</b> purposes in pesticide residue analysis of fruit and vegetable samples. For this purpose, analytical methodology for multiresidue determination of 11 pesticides, taken as a model, has been developed and validated in nine food matrices for the three mass analyzers coupled to ultra high pressure liquid chromatography. In all cases, limits of quantification around 0. 01 mg/kg were reached, fulfilling the most restrictive case of baby-food analysis. Regarding absolute sensitivity, the lower limits of detection were obtained, as expected, for QqQ (100 fg), whereas slightly higher limits (300 fg) were obtained for both TOF and QTOF. Confirmative capacity of each analyzer was studied for each analyte based on the identification points (IPs) criterion, useful for a comprehensive comparison. QTOF mass analyzer showed the highest confirmatory capacity, although QqQ normally led to sufficient number of IPs, even at lower concentration levels. The {{potential of}} TOF MS was also investigated for screening purposes. To this aim, around 50 commercial fruits and vegetables samples were analyzed, searching for more than 400 pesticides. TOF MS {{proved to be an}} attractive analytical tool for rapid detection and reliable identification {{of a large number of}} pesticides thanks to the full spectrum acquisition at accurate mass with satisfactory sensitivity. This process is readily boosted when combined with specialized software packages, together with theoretical exact mass databases. Several pesticides (e. g. carbendazim in citrus and indoxacarb in grape) were detected in the samples. Further unequivocal confirmation of the identity was performed using reference standards and/or QTOF MS/MS experiments...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} cost {{effectiveness}} of strategies {{to screen for}} and treat familial hypercholesterolaemia. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis. A care pathway for each patient was delineated and the associated probabilities, benefits, and costs were calculated. PARTICIPANTS: Simulated population aged 16 - 54 years in England and Wales. INTERVENTIONS: Identification and treatment of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia by universal screening, opportunistic screening in primary care, screening of people admitted to hospital with premature myocardial infarction, or tracing family members of affected patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cost effectiveness calculated as cost per life year gained (extension of life expectancy resulting from intervention) including estimated costs of screening and treatment. RESULTS: Tracing of family members was the most cost effective strategy (3097 pounds sterling (euros 5066, $ 4479) per life year gained) as 2. 6 individuals need to be screened to identify one case {{at a cost of}} 133 pounds sterling per case detected. If the genetic mutation was known within the family then the cost per life year gained (4914 pounds sterling) was only slightly increased by genetic confirmation of the diagnosis.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE:To {{compare the}} results, in {{clinical}} practice, of screening procedures for hydoxychloroquine retinopathy, {{according to the}} new recommendations of the American Academy of Ophthalmology of 2011. METHODS:Hundred and eighty-four patients on long-term hydroxychloroquine underwent ophthalmologic evaluation, including fundus examination, 10. 2 automated visual field, fundus autofluorescence, SD-OCT optical coherence tomography, and multifocal ERG, whenever possible, in a prospective monocentric study. RESULTS:There was a significant correlation (P< 0. 05) between cumulative HCQ dose and positive results on SD-OCT and 10. 2 visual field. There were no significant correlations between high cumulative HCQ dose and positive results for fundus examination, autofluorescence, or multifocal ERG. Average cumulative doses between the healthy group (946 g) and the maculopathy group (1427 g) were significantly different (P< 0. 05). Out of 184 patients, 12 toxic maculopathies were found (prevalence 6. 5 %). For these 12 cases, 5 were diagnosed at clinical stages, and 7 were diagnosed in the early preclinical stage. Ten patients had positive visual fields, and 8 patients had pathological SD-OCT signs. Autofluorescence was affected in the clinical stage, but not in the preclinical stage. In four out of the twelve cases of maculopathy, patients had pathological ERG results. CONCLUSION:The significant correlation between cumulative HCQ dose, considered as the main risk factor for maculopathy, and positive SD-OCT and 10. 2 visual field results render the combination of these two tests the basis of the screening strategy for plaquenil maculopathy. These results suggest using a simplified screening procedure, including annual SD-OCT and 10. 2 visual field while taking the cumulative dose into account. Multifocal ERG seems more helpful for diagnostic <b>confirmation</b> than <b>screening,</b> especially for the preclinical stage. Fundus autofluorescence is not an efficient test for early diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|In {{a survey}} {{conducted}} in 2010 / 2011 data from the 28 EU member states, four EU candidate states (Croatia, FYROM, Iceland, Turkey), three potential EU candidate states (Bosnia Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia), and two EFTA states (Norway and Switzerland) were collected. The status and function of newborn screening (NBS) programmes were investigated from the information to prospective parents and the public via confirmation of a positive screening result up to decisions on treatment. This article summarises the results from screening laboratory findings to start of treatment. In addition we asked {{about the existence of}} feedback loops reporting the conclusions of <b>confirmation</b> of <b>screening</b> results to the screening laboratory and communication of long-term outcome to diagnostic units and possibly existing central registries. Parallel to the description of actual practices of where, how and by whom the different steps of the programmes are executed, we also asked for the existence of guidelines or directives regulating the screening programmes, material to support information of parents about diagnoses and treatment and training facilities for professionals involved in the programmes. This survey gives a first comprehensive overview of the steps following a positive screening result in European NBS programmes. The 37 data sets reveal substantial variation of national screening panels, but also a lot of similarities. Analysis across all countries revealed that actual practice is often organised but not regulated by guidelines. Material to inform patients is available more often for explaining treatment (69 %) than explaining the necessity of confirmatory diagnostics (41 %). Training of professionals is rarely regulated by a guideline (2 %), but is offered for paediatricians (40 %) and dieticians (29 %) and only rarely for other professions (e. g. geneticists, clinical nurse specialists, psychologists). Registry-based evaluation of long-term outcome is as yet almost nonexistent (3 %). © SSIEM and Springer 2012...|$|R
40|$|Lipegfilgrastim is a long-acting, once-per-cycle, glycopegylated {{recombinant}} {{granulocyte colony-stimulating factor}} (G-CSF) used {{to prevent}} neutropenia in patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. This integrated analysis examined the immunogenicity of lipegfilgrastim and its potential clinical impact in two double-blind randomized studies (phases II and III) of patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. Serum samples were analyzed using sequential assays for <b>screening,</b> <b>confirmation,</b> antibody titer, and characterization of antidrug antibodies (ADA). Neutropenia-related efficacy measures were reviewed for each ADA-positive patient. Among 255 patients receiving lipegfilgrastim (154 in phase II, 101 in phase III) and 155 patients receiving pegfilgrastim (54 in phase II, 101 in phase III), the incidence of treatment-emergent ADA was low and similar between the lipegfilgrastim (phase II: 1. 3 %; phase III: 1. 0 %) and pegfilgrastim (phase II: 1. 9 %; phase III: 1. 0 %) arms. None of the treatment-emergent ADA-positive samples exhibited neutralizing activity against lipegfilgrastim, pegfilgrastim, or glycosylated G-CSF in a cell-based neutralizing antibody assay. No changes were observed in neutropenia-related efficacy measures among ADA-positive patients, and no treatment-related hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis occurred. These results indicate {{that there is no}} apparent impact of ADA on lipegfilgrastim efficacy and safety...|$|R
40|$|Background Although {{vector control}} strategies, such as insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) and indoor {{residual}} spraying (IRS) {{have been effective}} in Kenya the transmission of malaria continues to afflict western Kenya. This residual transmission is driven in part by Anopheles arabiensis, known for its opportunistic blood feeding behaviour and propensity to feed outdoors. The objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate the efficacy of the drug eprinomectin at reducing malaria vector density when applied to cattle (Bos indicus), the primary source of blood for An. arabiensis, under field conditions. Methods A pilot study was carried out in the Samia District of western Kenya from September to October of 2014. Treatment and control areas were randomly designated and comprised of 50 homes per study area. Before cattle treatments, baseline mosquito counts were performed after pyrethrum spray. Cows in the treatment area were administered topical applications of eprinomectin at 0. 5 mg/kg once a week for two consecutive weeks. Mosquito collections were performed once each week for two weeks following the eprinomectin treatments. Mosquitoes were first identified morphologically and with molecular <b>confirmation,</b> then <b>screened</b> for sporozoite presence and host blood using PCR-based methods. Results The indoor resting density of An. arabiensis was significantly reduced by 38 % in the treatment area compared to the control area at one-week post-treatment (Control mean females per hut = 1. 33 95 % CI [1. 08, 1. 64]; Treatment = 0. 79 [0. 56, 1. 07]). An increase in the indoor resting density of Anopheles gambiae s. s. and Anopheles funestus s. s. was observed in the treatment area in the absence of An. arabiensis. At two weeks post-treatment, the total number of mosquitoes for any species per hut was not significantly different between the treatment and control areas. No change was observed in An. arabiensis host preference as a result of treatment. Conclusions Systemic drugs may be an important tool by which to supplement existing vector control interventions by significantly impacting outdoor malaria transmission driven by An. arabiensis through the treatment of cattle.
