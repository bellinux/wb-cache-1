Modern gas stations have pay-at-the-pump capabilities — in most cases <b>credit,</b> <b>debit,</b> ATM cards, fuel cards and fleet cards are accepted. Occasionally a station will have a pay-at-the-pump-only period per day, when attendants are not present, often at night, and some stations are pay-at-the-pump-only 24 hours a day.|$|E

2500|$|For {{some time}} the press had {{reported}} that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co (KKR), the firm which had purchased First Data in 2007 for $28 billion, was considering selling First Data's financial services business {{in an effort}} to recoup losses. The division consists of First Data's <b>credit,</b> <b>debit</b> and retail card processing services, and was valued at around $4 to $5 billion. [...] Within one day of Bisignano becoming CEO the sale was announced to be off. Publications such as Bloomberg Businessweek credited the halt to Bisignano, quoting KKR executive Scott Nutall as stating [...] "one of the first things Frank said to me was, ’Don’t sell it! I think I can fix it." [...] Bisignano announced that there were [...] "synergies" [...] between First Data's divisions, and instead of breaking up the company he was considering options such as a partial public offering and boosting profits.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>credit</b> and <b>debit</b> cards and the invisible information which they hold raises {{an argument that}} these cards may not {{be covered by the}} meaning of “document” in the context of forgery under the Libyan Penal Code. Under forgery law in Libya, the subject matter of forgery must be a “document” or a “paper”. Because the principle of legality is one of the legal systems’ fundamental principles, these two words (document and paper) may not be applicable to <b>credit</b> and <b>debit</b> cards. This raises a problem not only relating to whether existing criminal law covers the alteration of information on <b>credit</b> and <b>debit</b> cards, it has also features when one considers whether current Libyan law provides for an offence of using one of these false cards. The offence of using a forged document requires a forged document as a subject matter of the offence. Thus, existing forgery law under the Libyan Penal Code may not be applicable to <b>credit</b> and <b>debit</b> card forgery. Another problem which occurs is that possession under the Libyan forgery law is not a crime. Therefore, the possession of a false <b>credit</b> or <b>debit</b> card is not currently an offence in Libya. This raises another problem which confirms the insufficiency of the current forgery law in Libya. Therefore, this thesis begins by examining the concept of <b>credit</b> and <b>debit</b> cards and the information they contain. Thereafter, the subject matter of forgery under the Libyan Penal Code, namely the words “document” and “paper” will be explored, followed by an examination of the offence of using a false <b>credit</b> and <b>debit</b> card, and the potential offence of possession. The main aim of the thesis is to suggest an effective proposal to the legislator in Libya for improving forgery law to deal with <b>credit</b> and <b>debit</b> card forgery...|$|R
