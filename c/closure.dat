5|$|British Rail {{formally}} {{announced plans}} to close the station on 15 March 1984, pending a statutory consultation process. <b>Closure</b> notices were posted at Marylebone. The proposals proved controversial and faced strong opposition from local authorities and the public, leading to a legal battle which lasted for two years. Despite the pending <b>closure,</b> passenger numbers only dropped by about 400 per day from 1968 levels. The conversion project proved impractical due to the headroom limitations {{on the line and}} the <b>closure</b> was quietly dropped.|$|E

The findings of this investigation provide evidence for the necessity to revisit the goals and objectives of fishery <b>closures.</b> The process of re-evaluating the goals of fishery time-area <b>closures</b> can encourage fishers and management officials to collaborate and work toward a common conservation goal that can provide both biological and economic benefits...|$|R

5|$|Pulmonic {{consonant}} {{letters are}} arranged singly or in pairs of voiceless (tenuis) and voiced sounds, with these then grouped in columns from front (labial) sounds {{on the left}} to back (glottal) sounds on the right. In official publications by the IPA, two columns are omitted to save space, with the letters listed among 'other symbols', and with the remaining consonants arranged in rows from full <b>closure</b> (occlusives: stops and nasals), to brief <b>closure</b> (vibrants: trills and taps), to partial <b>closure</b> (fricatives) and minimal <b>closure</b> (approximants), again with a row left out to save space. In the table below, a slightly different arrangement is made: All pulmonic consonants {{are included in the}} pulmonic-consonant table, and the vibrants and laterals are separated out so that the rows reflect the common lenition pathway of stop → fricative → approximant, as well as the fact that several letters pull double duty as both fricative and approximant; affricates may be created by joining stops and fricatives from adjacent cells. Shaded cells are judged to be implausible.|$|E

40|$|Three {{methods of}} closing {{bronchial}} stumps were evaluated in 90 dogs undergoing left pneumonectomy:interrupted 3 - 0 silk sutures, interrupted 3 - 0 nylon sutures, and stapling {{with an automatic}} device. The dogs were sacrificed at 24 hours, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 days after pneumonectomy. Brochial stump leakage pressures and histological studies were performed on all specimens. Differences in the exudative reaction between silk and staple <b>closures</b> were significant on day 5 (238. 19 +/- 23. 28 SD PMN's/HPF in silk <b>closures,</b> 34. 95 +/- 20. 37 SD PMN's/HPF in staple <b>closures)</b> and therafter(P less than 0. 001). The reaction to nylon was intermediate between silk and staple. Collagen levels were highest at all periods for staple <b>closures.</b> Staple leakage pressures were greater than silk or nylon(day 5 : 145. 3 mm Hg +/- 64. 9 SD in staple <b>closures,</b> 40. 2 mm Hg +/- 15. 4 SD in silk <b>closures).</b> These results have clinical relevance to the selection of suture materials for stump <b>closures...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} hospital <b>closures</b> on geographical access by potential patients, using data from four southeastern U. S. states. Using optimization models designed to minimize the adverse effects of hospital <b>closures,</b> extensive computations are performed {{and the results are}} discussed. The effects of the <b>closures</b> on the rural areas is also investigated. Finally, the paper determines which hospitals are most likely among those to be closed assuming that up to 10 % of the existing hospitals {{in each of the four}} states were to be shut down. The overall conclusion of the empirical findings is that while differences exist among the states, efficiency, coverage, and equality measures for geographical access do not suffer significantly if only a few hospitals are closed in each state, provided these <b>closures</b> are done optimally to minimize impact. Further, for efficiency objectives, decision makers can follow a sequential strategy for <b>closures</b> and still be guaranteed optimality. The paper also discusses the effects of hospital <b>closures</b> on equity and it examines whether or not rural areas are disproportionately affected by <b>closures.</b> Keywords: Health care, Access to health care, Proximity, Hospital <b>closures,</b> Location problems, Facility plannin...|$|R
