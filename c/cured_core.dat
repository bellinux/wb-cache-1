40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of thickness, filling methods and curing meth-ods on the polymerization of dual <b>cured</b> <b>core</b> materials by means of microhardness test. Two dual <b>cured</b> <b>core</b> materials, MultiCore Flow (Ivoclar Vivadent AG, Schaan, Liechtenstein) and Bis-Core (Bisco Inc., Schaumburg, IL, USA) were used in this study. 2 ㎜ (bulky filled), 4 ㎜ (bulky filled), 6 ㎜ (bulky and incrementally filled) and 8 ㎜ (bulky and incrementally filled) -thickness specimens were prepared with light cure or self cure mode. After storage at 37 ℃ for 24 hours, the Knoop hardness values (KHN) of top and bottom surfaces were measured and the microhardness ratio of top and bottom surfaces was calculated. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Scheffe multiple comparison test, with α = 0. 05. The effect of thickness on the polymerization of dual cured composites showed material specific results. In 2, 4 and 6 ㎜ groups, the KHN of two materials were not affected by thickness. However, in 8 ㎜ group of MultiCore Flow, the KHN of the bottom surface was lower than those of other groups (p < 0. 05). The effect of filling methods on the polymerization of dual cured composites was different by their thickness or materials. In 6 ㎜ thickness, there was no significant difference between bulk and incremental filling groups. In 8 ㎜ thickness, Bis-Core showed no significant dif...|$|E
2500|$|Another type of binder {{process is}} called the hot-box process, which uses a {{thermoset}} and catalyst for a binder. The sand with the binder is packed into a core box that is heated to approximately [...] (which is where the name originated from). The binder that touches the hot surface of the core box begins to cure within 10 to 30seconds. Depending {{on the type of}} binder it may require further baking to fully <b>cure.</b> <b>Cores</b> produced using this method are sometimes referred to as [...] "shell-core" [...] because often, only the outside layer of the core is hardened when in contact with the hot corebox. When the corebox is opened and the core removed, the uncured sand inside the core is dumped out to be reused. This practice can also be observed in some cold-box coremaking practices, though cold box shell-core making is much less common.|$|R
40|$|Course-based {{undergraduate}} research experiences (CUREs) {{have gained}} traction as {{effective ways to}} expand the impact of undergraduate research while fulfilling pedagogical goals. In this Perspective, we present innovative ways to incorporate fundamental benefits and principles of CUREs into a classroom environment through information/technology-based research projects that lead to student-generated contributions to digital community resources (CoRes). These projects represent an attractive class of CUREs because they are less resource-intensive than laboratory-based CUREs, and the projects align with the expectations of today’s students to create rapid and publicly accessible contributions to society. We provide a detailed discussion of two example types of CoRe projects that can be implemented in courses to impact research and education at the chemistry–biology interface: bioinformatics annotations and development of educational tools. Finally, we present current resources available for faculty interested in incorporating <b>CUREs</b> or <b>CoRe</b> projects into their pedagogical practices. In sharing these stories and resources, we hope to lower the barrier for widespread adoption of <b>CURE</b> and <b>CoRe</b> approaches and generate discussions about how to utilize the classroom experience to make {{a positive impact on}} our students {{and the future of the}} field of biochemistry...|$|R
40|$|Aims The aim of {{this study}} was to investigate, by means of the {{push-out}} test, the bond of Prime & Bond NT at various post-space dentin locations and the influence of time of water storage on bond strength values. Methods 30 single-rooted teeth were used for the bond strength measurement. In each tooth fiber posts were cemented with the commercial bonding system “Prime & Bond NT” in combination with the resin-based filling material “Opticore <b>Cure</b> <b>Core</b> Composite”. After 24 h (group A: 10 roots), 1 month (group B: 10 roots), and 6 months (group C: 10 roots) of water storage, the specimens were sectioned in 1 mm-thick slices for the push-out test. The data were divided into three regions (coronal/middle/apical) and analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis Test and Mann-Whitney U Test (p< 0. 05). Results The bond strength values registered did not show statistically significant differences within group A and C; within group B statistically significant differences were found between the coronal and the middle thirds and between the coronal and the apical third. The apical bond strength values did not show any statistically significant difference among the three groups (Kruskal-Wallis test); in the middle thirds a statistically significant difference was found at 6 months when compared with the 24 h and 1 -month samples. In the coronal thirds was found a statistically significant difference between 1 month and 6 months. Analysis of the specimens under optical microscope revealed a prevalence of adhesive failures between fiber post and root dentin. Conclusions Bond strength values are lower at the apical third. Over time the adhesion of the fiberpost/luting cement/post-space dentin does not remain stable...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{constitutes the}} final report {{for the study of}} humidity effects and loading rate on soluble core (PVA/MB composite material) mechanical and thermal properties under Contract No. 100345. This report describes test results procedures employed, and any unusual occurrences or specific observations associated with this test program. The primary objective of this work was to determine if <b>cured</b> soluble <b>core</b> filler material regains its tensile and compressive strength after exposure to high humidity conditions and following a drying cycle. Secondary objectives include measurements of tensile and compressive modulus, and Poisson's ratio, and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) for various moisture exposure states. A third objective was to compare the mechanical and thermal properties of the composite using 'SG' and 'CG' type extendospheres. The proposed facility for the manufacture of soluble cores at the Yellow Creek site incorporates no capability for the control of humidity. Recent physical property tests performed with the soluble core filler material showed that prolonged exposure to high humidity significantly degradates in strength. The purpose of these tests is to determine if the product, process or facility designs require modification to avoid imparting a high risk condition to the ASRM...|$|R
30|$|To {{prevent a}} gap between both tubes due to an axially thermal expansion, the core has to {{be divided into two}} parts. A male and a female part of the core result which have a small loose fit to each other, minimising the coaxial tolerances. Being the same {{material}} with the same thermal expansion, the bearing persists over the entire temperature range of the <b>cure</b> cycle. The <b>core</b> has a sealing element to prevent an excessive adhesive flow from the bondline to the core. An outer sealing of the bondline is realised by a heat resistant tape. With a weight on top of the tubes, a consolidation force is applied to the bondline to prevent any voids and air inclusions.|$|R
40|$|The goal of Boeing's Advanced Technology Composite Aircraft Structures (ATCAS) {{program is}} to develop the {{technology}} required for cost-and weight-efficient use of composite materials in transport fuselage structure. Carbon fiber reinforced epoxy was chosen for fuselage skins and stiffening elements, and for passenger and cargo floor structures. The automated fiber placement (AFP) process was selected for fabrication of stringer-stiffened and sandwich skin panels. Circumferential and window frames were braided and resin transfer molded (RTM'd). Pultrusion was selected for fabrication of floor beams and constant-section stiffening elements. Drape forming was chosen for stringers and other stiffening elements cocured to skin structures. Significant process development efforts included AFP, braiding, RTM, autoclave <b>cure,</b> and <b>core</b> blanket fabrication for both sandwich and stiffened-skin structure. Outer-mold-line and inner-mold-line tooling was developed for sandwich structures and stiffened-skin structure. The effect of design details, process control and tool design on repeatable, dimensionally stable, structure for low cost barrel assembly was assessed. Subcomponent panels representative of crown, keel, and side quadrant panels were fabricated to assess scale-up effects and manufacturing anomalies for full-scale structures. Manufacturing database including time studies, part quality, and manufacturing plans were generated to support the development of designs and analytical models to access cost, structural performance, and dimensional tolerance...|$|R
40|$|Well {{productivity}} decline {{have been}} widely observed for gas wells producing the reservoir fines. The phenomenon has been explained by the lifting, migration and subsequent plugging of the pores by the fine particles, finally resulting in permeability decrease. It has been observed in numerous core flood tests and field cases. This paper {{is based on a}} study and evaluation of a gas field in the North-western margin of the Nile Delta. It is a super gas field with current production capability of 0. 8  Bcf/d. It has the potential to produce above this level with the current stock of wells but have only been limited to this through-put due to considerable losses in well productivity that the wells have experienced in recent years due to fines migration phenomenon. Well testing analysis and well performance analysis were done to detect formation damage and provide an overall measure of formation damage. Laboratory core flood tests had been used to determine the causes, degree, and extent of damage. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the rock samples used for the core flood test before and after the test. Core flood test had been done to evaluate the effect of acid on improving and <b>curing</b> damaged <b>cores.</b> Matrix acid stimulation on a case study from the studied field was evaluated...|$|R
40|$|A high {{molecular}} weight, carboxyl functionalised solid rubber {{was added to}} an epoxy resin-aromatic amino system developed for autoclave <b>curing</b> of honeycomb <b>core</b> composite structures. The achievement of an optimal balance of viscous flow and viscoelasticity of the resin, by controlling {{the nature and extent}} of cross-linking of the functionalised rubber, was proposed as a route to void-free honeycomb skins. The aim of the present investigation is to understand howthe concentration of carboxylic groups of the rubber, prereacted with one of the epoxy monomers, affects the matrix resin flow properties. The concentration of carboxyl groups was changed by reacting them with a monofunctional epoxy resin. Dynamic shear viscosity profiles varying frequency, temperature and as function of time during isothermal cure have been determined for blends with differently functionalised rubbers. Carbon fibre wettability and laminate consolidation quality have been evaluated, making composite samples according to conventional prepregging and autoclave curing processes, through electron microscopy of fracture surfaces from transverse flexural strength tests...|$|R

Taking into account the ingredients and structure of the polymeric composition can also refer to a curing process in a binder - mineral matrix mixture. In the system of binder-mineral matrix under the influence of ultraviolet radiation is also observed effect of binding. However, the bonding process does not occur in the entire volume of the investigated system, but only on the surface, which gives some possibilities for application in the use of UV <b>curing</b> surface of <b>cores,</b> and also to cure sand moulds in 3 D printing technology...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to characterize the microstructural properties of cemented paste backfill (CPB) after its self-weight consolidation in columns. To reach this objective, three self-weight consolidation column tests that have each 3 m height were carried out on in situ CPB samples at Louvicourt mine’s backfill plant. These columns simulate three realistic drainage scenarios such as fully drained (FD), half-drained (HD) and undrained (UD) columns. After a 90 -day <b>curing</b> time, 20 <b>core</b> samples were taken from each consolidated CPB column and subjected to uniaxial compression tests followed by mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) tests and BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) specific surface analysis. Results showed that the MIP total porosity and the specific surface area data of CPB materials are well correlated to the uniaxial compressive strength values. Maximum strength (2. 9 MPa) was associated with the completely drained CPB which usually has finer pores, a lower total porosity and a relatively higher specific surface area. This correlation is appreciably different between the bottom and the top of each column consolidated backfill material.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the irradiance of <b>curing</b> units through <b>core</b> and veneered hot-pressed ceramics {{as well as}} the transmittance of these materials. Discs of 0. 7, 1. 4 and 2 mm in thickness of Empress (EMP) and Empress Esthetic (EST), and 0. 8 (n= 5) and 1. 1 mm (n= 5) thickness of Empress 2 (E 2) were obtained. For E 2, two of the 0. 8 -mm-thick discs were covered with dentin (1. 2 - and 1. 4 -mm-thick) and two with dentin + enamel (1. 5 -mm-thick). The 1. 1 -mm-thick specimens were submitted to the same veneering procedures. Specimens were evaluated by UV-Vis transmittance analysis and the percentage of transmittance was recorded. Irradiance through each specimen was evaluated with a quartz-tungsten-halogen (QTH), used in continuous or intermittent exposure modes, or a blue lightemitting diode (LED). Data were analyzed by Dunnett???s test, ANOVA and Tukey???s test at 5 % significance level. Exposure through ceramic decreased the irradiance for all ceramics. Irradiance through EST was significantly higher than through EMP. For E 2, reduction in irradiance depended on the core and/or veneer thickness. The QTH intermittent mode showed higher irradiance than the continuous mode, and both showed higher irradiance than LED. The ceramic significantly influenced irradiance and transmittance, which were found to decrease with the increase in thickness...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The DBA/ 2 J mouse line {{develops}} essential iris atrophy, pigment dispersion, and glaucomatous age-related changes, {{including an}} increase of IOP, optic nerve atrophy, and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate possible morphological changes in the outer retina of the DBA/ 2 J mouse concomitant with disease progression and aging, based on the reduction of both the a- and b-waves and photopic flicker ERGs in this mouse line. Methods. Vertically sectioned DBA/ 2 J mice retinas were evaluated at 3, 8, and 16 months of age using photoreceptor, horizontal, and bipolar cell markers. Sixteen-month-old C 57 BL/ 6 mice retinas were used as controls. Results. The DBA/ 2 J mice had outer retinal degeneration at all ages, with the most severe degeneration in the oldest retinas. At 3 months of age, the number of photoreceptor cells and the thickness of the OPL were reduced. In addition, there was a loss of horizontal and ON-bipolar cell processes. At 8 months of age, RGC degeneration occurred in patches, and in the outer retina overlying these patches, cone morphology was impaired with a reduction in size as well as loss of outer segments and growth of horizontal and bipolar cell processes into the outer nuclear layer. At 16 months of age, connectivity between photoreceptors and horizontal and bipolar cell processes overlying these patches was lost. Conclusions. Retinal degeneration in DBA/ 2 J mice includes photoreceptor death, loss of bipolar and horizontal cell processes, and loss of synaptic contacts in an aging-dependent manner.

40|$|Objectives The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the influence of the C-factor and the mode of polymerization on the cohesive strength of various dual-cure resin cements. Methods Three curing conditions were tested; chemical curing with free shrinkage conditions (C = 0), and constraint shrinkage conditions (C = 25), and dual-curing with free shrinkage conditions (C = 0). Opaque polyethylene, brass (pretreated with Clearfil SE bond), and transparent polyethylene tubes respectively, were filled with the different cements. The tubes were 20 mm long with an inner diameter of 1. 6 or 1. 8 mm. Five cements, DC Core Automix, Panavia F 2. 0, Maxcem, Multilink, and RelyX Unicem, were tested with ten specimens per group. The specimens were trimmed to an hour-glass shape with a neck diameter of 1 mm, stored in water (37 °C, 24 h), and subjected to microtensile testing (1 mm min− 1). SEM analysis was carried out on chemically cured samples of DC Core Automix C = 0 and C = 25. Data were statistically analyzed (Two-way ANOVA, Tukey's post hoc test, p < 0. 05). Results Most cements showed no significant differences between the curing modes. A high C-factor negatively influences the cohesive strength of some cements. SEM analysis shows that chemical <b>curing</b> of DC <b>Core</b> Automix in a high C-factor environment leads to more and larger microvoids in the cement. Significance Constraint shrinkage conditions, i. e. a high C-factor, can negatively influence the physical properties of a dual-cured resin cement, which would clinically be the case in the confined space of a root canal or post space preparation...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringKyle RidingThe {{relationship}} between in-place concrete strength and permeability with concrete cylinder strength and permeability with {{time is of}} interest - especially when supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) are used. A joint research project between The University of Kansas was undergone to quantify these relationships. The permeability of concrete is directly tied to its ability to mitigate certain failure mechanisms such as corrosion and sulfate attack. 	The three concrete mixtures being tested by Kansas State University (KSU) vary in cementitious content as follows: (1) 100 % ordinary portland cement (OPC), (2) 25 % Class F fly ash (F-ash) and 75 % OPC, (3) 25 % Class C fly ash (C-Ash) and 75 % OPC. The mixtures were also placed in three different seasons to present differing curing environmental effects. The summer slabs were cast during July and August. The fall slabs were cast in October and November. The final set of slabs were cast in March and April. Three sets of concrete specimens (lab cured, field <b>cured</b> and in-situ <b>core</b> specimens) were tested at 28, 56, 90, 180, and 360 days for strength and permeability properties. The permeability performance tests being utilized are ASTM C 1202 and ASTM C 642. 	The results have shown very desirable permeability and strength data for the mixes using blended fly ash cements. The F-ash exhibited the best high early strength and low permeability data for the summer placement season and slower strength and permeability performance at cold weather. The C-ash performed the best overall for all seasons and had the least environmental effects. The OPC performed the worst in regards to permeability and did not reach as high long term strength...|$|R
