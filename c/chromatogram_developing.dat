40|$|Graduation date: 1965 One {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} three commercial detergents by comparing their removals at 70 and 120 °F. of palmitic acid and clay components of a simulated natural soil which had been applied to wool yarns by immersion and abrasion methods. These detergents were a built soap and two cold water detergents designed for laundering wool. The methodology of detergency measurement became as important as the results because of controversy in the literature concerning the realism and accuracy of the techniques and soils. An artificial soil composed of clay and a simulated sebum solution containing palmitic acid, olive oil, squalene, and n-decyl alcohol was modeled after analyses of natural soils. This was deposited on wool yarns by the widely-used immersion method and an abrasion method, utilizing an abradant surface of vinyl to simulate skin. In order to obtain an accurate and quantitative measurement of detergency efficiency, radioactive tracer methods were used. Palmitic acid-C¹⁴ was utilized to trace the removal of the oil components while clay labeled with Fe⁵⁹ by ion exchange indicated the removal of the particulate portion. The activity of the C¹⁴-labeled soils was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. A new method of counting the yarns directly in the scintillation solution was patterned after the techniques for counting paper <b>chromatograms</b> <b>developed</b> by Wang and Jones (191). An Auto Gamma Spectrometer was used to measure the activity of the Fe⁵⁹ labeled soils.

40|$|The {{facilitated}} diffusion of glucose across the human erythrocyte membrane {{has already been}} established by kinetic studies {{to be consistent with}} a carrier mechanism. Little is known biochemically about the carrier or the type of associations formed in its binding with glucose. In the experimental work to be described consideration was given to various possibilities of associations between membrane lipids and glucose molecules. Human erythrocyte stroma were incubated with glucosefor short periods at ice-cold temperatures and were then either extracted with lipid solvents, or freeze-dried prior to such extractions. Separation of the radioactivity and lipids in the extracts was effected by silicic acid/Hyflo column and thin-layer plate chromatography. Where possible a qualitative analysis was made of the lipid fractions associated with the radioactivity. One of the kinetic features of the system in whole cells is the saturation of the carriers with increasing glucose concentration. Indications of this were looked for in experiments with increasing amounts of glucose but recoveries of radioactivity amongst the lipids did not appear to become saturated. The effects of the reversible inhibitors phloretin and stilboestrol and of the irreversible inhibitors dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) and mercuric ions on the recovery of labelling and the chromatographic behaviour of the lipids and radioactivity have been studied. Sheep erythrocytes have no detectable sugar transfer system and so a comparison was made between sheep and human erythrocyte lipid extracts following incubation of the cells with C glucose under the same experimental conditions. The main advances resulting from the experiments has been the demonstration of a lipid soluble C glucose-containing material extractable from freeze-dried human ghosts by the methods used by Handa (1963) for glycolipids. The recovery of this material is markedly reduced by treatment of the ghosts with dinitrofluorobenzene or mercuric ions.

The shoots of CCC-treated and untreated wheat plants were extracted with ethanol, the plant extract purified, separated by paper chromatography, and subjected to bioassay and color test. A refinement was made in the procedure for purifying plant extracts. Most of the pigments and lipid substances were removed from the alcoholic extract by partitioning with n-hexane. The acidic auxin fraction was further purified using column chromatography with basic alumina, WoeIm alumina, serving as the stationary phase. Direct bioassay of sections of chromatograms by the Avena elongation test revealed a growth promoting region on <b>chromatograms</b> <b>developed</b> in several solvent systems at a R[subscript f] comparable to the R[subscript f] of IAA. A colored spot having the developmental characteristics of IAA appeared on paper chromatograms at the same relative R[subscript f] zone upon spraying with a chromogenic reagent, p-dimethyl-aminocinnamaldehyde (DMAC).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the Quantitative estimation of Capecitabine in pure powder and its {{pharmaceutical dosage form}} by UV spectroscopy (geometric correction method), RP – HPLC and HPTLC methods. In the UV method, geometrical correction procedures have been developed which reduce or eliminate the background irrelevant absorption that may be present in samples of biological origin. In this method, three wavelengths 263, 281, and 293 nm were selected for the estimation of Capacitabine in Serum. Based on the absorbance the corrected absorbance was calculated. Capecitabine was quantified by using the corrected absorbance. In the RP-HPLC method, the drug was resolved using a mobile phase [methanol: buffer (1 ml glacial acetic acid in 1000 ml water) (45 : 55 % v/v) ] on C 18 column [develosil ODS-MG- 5 (100 nm  4. 6 mm) 5 ] in isocratic mode. The retention time of Capecitabine {{was found to be}} 2. 17 min. In HPTLC method, the <b>chromatograms</b> were <b>developed</b> by using a mobile phase [Chloroform: glacial acetic acid: methanol (8 : 1 : 1 % v/v) ] on precoated plate of silica gel 60 F 254 and quantified by CAMAG TLC scanner 3, at 240 nm.

40|$|Withania somnifera (WS), {{also known}} as Ashwagandha, Indian ginseng and winter cherry, has been an {{important}} herb in the ayruvedic and indigenous medical system for over 3000 years. Antioxidant activity and phytochemical analysis of both in vitro and in vivo grown leaves were studied in W. somnifera at different time period. Antioxidants are an important group of medicinal preventive compounds as well as being food additives inhibiting detrimental changes of easily oxidizable nutrients. The estimated antioxidant enzymes were superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase. The analyses were carried out in the leaves of in vitro and in vivo plants. It was found that in vitro leaves contained a significant quantity of enzymatic antioxidants than in the leaves of in vivo plants. Plants are able to produce and accumulate many medicinally valuable secondary metabolites. Search for the concerned active compounds has led to the identification of several withanolides, alkaloids, steroids, phenolics, tannins, saponins and quinones from leaves of W. somnifera. The fresh leaves were extracted with increasing and decreasing polarity of solvents and it was found that ethyl acetate extract contains all the metabolites present in the leaves, analyzed by thin layer chromatography using chloroform: methanol in the ratio of 9 : 1 as solvent system. The <b>chromatogram</b> was <b>developed</b> using 10 % sulphuric acid followed by heating and the spots were visualized. These findings have high significance in the pharmacological industry; however, a detailed investigation is needed to confirm this conclusion, which is underway in our laboratory...|$|R

40|$|Experiments {{reported}} in the accompanying pa-per (1) showed that an abnormally high per-centage of red cells from patients with acanthocy-tosis hemolyze when incubated at 370 or 40 C for 48 hours. This abnormal lysis was inhibited by heparin, supplementary glucose, and additions of normal serum. This report partially identifies the components of normal serum that inhibit such autohemolysis and the lipid composition and autohemolytic be-havior of "older " and younger cells separated by centrifugation. The implications and interrela-tionships of these data are discussed. Materials and Methods Methodology for the extraction and analysis of lipids has been described (2). Paper chromatography of phospholipids, however, was modified: a) During prepa-ration of the silicic acid paper, an extra (fifth) rinse in 0. 12 or 0. 25 % disodium EDTA was included, and b) the <b>chromatograms</b> were <b>developed</b> in diisobutyl ketone, n-butyl ether, acetic acid, and water (20 / 20 / 25 / 2, vol/ vol) for 14 to 20 hours. Distinct separation of ethanola-mine phosphoglycerides, serine phosphoglycerides, leci-thin, sphingomyelin, and lysolecithin was achieved. Phosphatidyl inositol migrated with or slightly behind sphingomyelin.
