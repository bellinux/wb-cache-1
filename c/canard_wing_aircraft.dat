50|$|Due to the J-10's aerodynamically {{unstable}} design, {{a digital}} quadruplex-redundant fly-by-wire (FBW) {{flight control system}} (FCS) aids the pilot in flying the aircraft. The FCS typically monitors pilot control inputs, preventing the pilot from accidentally exiting the flight envelope from applying too much control input during high performance flight situations. This is critical in <b>canard</b> <b>wing</b> <b>aircraft,</b> as {{they are capable of}} turning in a much tighter radius than conventional aircraft. The massive control surfaces are capable of moving so far that they can completely destroy the aircraft in flight at high airspeeds if not kept in check by the FCS.|$|E
50|$|Thanks {{to some of}} his intuitions, he {{has been}} the {{precursor}} of some devices extremely actual nowadays, like the variable incidence wings, the development of the <b>canard</b> <b>wings</b> or monoplane <b>aircraft</b> with the <b>wing</b> held by a single post. His activity has not been limited to the design, becoming also an entrepreneur, establishing a firm initially dealing with the manufacture under license of gliders, and then taking charge of the audit of aircraft for the Regia Aeronautica. He designed the Vittoria 1924 sport plane.|$|R

50|$|The Quickie's <b>canard</b> <b>wing</b> used a GU25-5(11)8 airfoil, {{developed}} by Terence Nonweiler. It suffered performance degradation at low Reynolds numbers and in rainy conditions.|$|R
40|$|Unsteady {{transonic}} flow calculations for aerodynamically interfering airfoil configurations are performed {{as a first}} step toward solving the three dimensional <b>canard</b> <b>wing</b> interaction problem. These calculations are performed by extending the XTRAN 2 L two dimensional unsteady transonic small disturbance code to include an additional airfoil. Unsteady transonic forces due to plunge and pitch motions of a two dimensional <b>canard</b> and <b>wing</b> are presented. Results for a variety of <b>canard</b> <b>wing</b> separation distances reveal the effects of aerodynamic interference on unsteady transonic airloads. Aeroelastic analyses employing these unsteady airloads demonstrate the effects of aerodynamic interference on aeroelastic stability and flutter. For the configurations studied, increases in wing flutter speed result with the inclusion of the aerodynamically interfering canard...|$|R
40|$|The pitch, yaw, {{and roll}} damping, {{as well as}} the oscillatory {{stability}} in pitch and in yaw, were measured for two <b>canard</b> <b>wing</b> configurations with wing sweeps of 44 deg and 60 deg. Tests were made at free stream Mach numbers of 0. 3, 0. 4, and 0. 7 and for angles of attack from about - 4 deg to 20 deg. The effects of various components such as the <b>canard,</b> nose strakes, <b>wings,</b> vertical tail, and horizontal tail were determined. The basic <b>canard</b> <b>wing,</b> vertical tail configurations generally had positive damping in pitch, yaw, and roll. The effect of the canard was generally beneficial except for its tendency to decrease the oscillatory directional stability...|$|R
50|$|Downforce {{is further}} {{enhanced}} through the two <b>canard</b> <b>wings</b> located beside the cockpit. The <b>canard</b> <b>wings</b> for the RV-1 {{are based on}} studies of disk wings. The shape permits {{a large amount of}} surface area while maintaining a short span. So that the wing angle of attack can be adjusted while the vehicle is in motion, the wings pivot from the front moved hydraulic actuators attached at the rear. This combination of a short span and two-point attachment provides a very rigid system which reduces the potential for flutter, a destructive aerodynamic phenomenon that results in rapid uncontrolled motion which can lead to structural failure.|$|R

40|$|A {{conceptual}} design optimization methodology {{was developed for}} a medium range box <b>wing</b> <b>aircraft.</b> A baseline conventional cantilever <b>wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> designed for the same mis- sion and payload was also optimized alongside a baseline box <b>wing</b> <b>aircraft.</b> An empirical formula for the mass estimation of the fore and aft wings of the box <b>wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> was derived by relating conventional cantilever wings to box <b>wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>wings.</b> The {{results indicate that the}} fore and aft wings would use the same correction coe cient and that the aft wing would be lighter than the fore wing on the medium range box <b>wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> because of reduced sweep. As part of the methodology, a computational study was performed to analyze di erent wing/tip n xities using a statically loaded idealized box wing con guration. The analy- ses determined the best joint xity by comparing the stress distributions in nite element torsion box models in addition to aerodynamic requirements. The analyses indicates that the rigid joint is the most suitable. Studies were also performed to investigate the structural implications of changing only the tip n inclinations on the box <b>wing</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Tip n inclination refers to the angle the tip n makes to the vertical body axis of the aircraft. No signi cant variations in wing structural design drivers as a function of tip n inclination were observed. Stochastic and deterministic optimization routines were performed on the baseline box <b>wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> using the methodology developed where the variables were wing area, av- erage thickness to chord ratio and sweep angle. The conventional aircraft design showed similar performance and characteristics to the equivalent in-service aircraft thereby pro- viding some validation to the methodology and the results for the box <b>wing</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Longitudinal stability investigations showed that the extra fuel capacity of the box wing in the ns could be used to reduce trim drag. The short period oscillation of the conventional cantilever <b>wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> was found to be satisfactory but the box <b>wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> was found to be unacceptable hence requiring stability augmentation systems. The eld and ight performance of the box wing showed to be better than the conventional cantilever <b>wing</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Overall, the economic advantages of the box <b>wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> over the conventional cantilever <b>wing</b> <b>aircraft</b> improve with increase in fuel price making the box wing a worthy replacement for the conventional cantilever <b>wing</b> <b>aircraft...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Grumman X-29 {{research}} aircraft had rear fuselage lateral fins or [...] "Tail fins", {{sometimes called}} strakes, continuous with the trailing {{edge of the}} main wing. This allowed the positioning of a rear control surface {{at the end of each}} fin. Together with the main and forward (<b>canard)</b> <b>wing</b> control surfaces, this effectively gave it a three-surface configuration.|$|R

50|$|The X-29 is {{described}} as a three surface <b>aircraft,</b> with <b>canards,</b> forward-swept <b>wings,</b> and aft strake control surfaces, using three-surface longitudinal control. The <b>canards</b> and <b>wings</b> result in reduced trim drag and reduced wave drag, while using the strakes for trim in situations where the center of gravity is off provides less trim drag than relying on the canard to compensate.|$|R
