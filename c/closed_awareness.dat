40|$|Analysis of {{a subset}} of data from a survey of 3696 relatives, friends and others who knew a sample of people dying in 1990 who lived in 20 areas of the United Kingdom (the Regional Study of Care for the Dying) is reported. Using the {{typology}} of awareness contexts developed by Glaser and Strauss [(1965) Awareness of Dying, Aldine, Chicago], the prevalence of different awareness contexts is described and compared with an earlier survey done in 1969. Open awareness of dying, where both the dying person and the respondent knew that the person was dying, is the most prevalent awareness context. This is particularly so in cancer and represents a change since 1969 when <b>closed</b> <b>awareness</b> (where the respondent knows, but the dying person does not) was more common. The characteristics of those dying in open and <b>closed</b> <b>awareness</b> contexts are then compared, suggesting that having cancer, not being mentally confused, having a respondent who knew {{for some time that}} the person was dying, and being of higher social class are independently predictive of full open awareness, a condition marked both by knowledge of dying, and a value commitment towards openness. Compared with people in <b>closed</b> <b>awareness,</b> people dying in full awareness are more able to plan their dying careers, so that they and their respondents are more satisfied with the degree of choice over the place of death, {{they are less likely to}} die alone, and are more likely to die in their own homes. Additionally, these individuals are more likely to have spoken of their wishes for euthanasia, another indicator of their desire to control the manner and timing of death. If dying from cancer, people in full open awareness are more likely to have received hospice care. It is suggested that underlying these patterns, and in contrast with some other cultures where awareness of dying is seen as less desirable, people dying in Anglophone countries are particularly concerned to maintain control over projects of self-identity. Their approach to death is a reflection of this individualism. death terminal care awareness hospice euthanasia...|$|E
40|$|Aim: This ethnographic {{study was}} {{concerned}} with how dying patients, palliative care staff and family caregivers communicate about life threatening illness in a palliative care setting in Ethiopia. Background: Ethiopia, as a developing country, has limited resources for caring for those with life limiting illnesses requiring end of life care. However, palliative care was supported by local champions in Ethiopia and by the Federal Ministry of Health. Introduction: The disclosure of bad news was discouraged because {{it was believed that}} such disclosure may lead to further distress and to loss of hope. Methods: Non-participant observation amounting to 276 hours of observation and ethnographic interviews with 4 patients, 6 family caregivers and 5 palliative care staff during two periods of data collection (November 2011 -January 2012, May 2012 -August 2012) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Findings: Various communication strategies were used by palliative care staff to create openness in communication with patients and family caregivers about terminal illness and dying. Ultimately palliative care staff deferred to family wishes about significant news disclosures, in order to avoid upset. Family caregivers were found to avoid disclosing news of a terminal illness to their family member and wished to keep the patient in <b>closed</b> <b>awareness.</b> In contrast, it an open awareness context existed between palliative care staff and family caregivers. Discussion: In managing truth telling in different cultural settings, medical, nursing staff and health policy makers need {{to take into account the}} various awareness contexts highlighted in this study. Palliative care staff should consider how actions such as protecting patients from upset may inadvertently deny the patient the right to exercise control. Conclusion and implications for policy: Health policy makers should ensure that the design and implementation of palliative care services should not be a wholesale adoption of Western style services but assure that such services are adapted to reflect the religious, cultural and social needs of the community. Foreign workers and volunteers who deliver palliative care services and education in Ethiopia should reflect local religious and cultural sensitivities...|$|E

(2) To investigate associations between psychosocial factors, frequency of milk expression, skin-to-skin holding (STS), and lactation performance, defined as maternal drive to express milk and milk volume. STUDY DESIGN: Self-reported psychological questionnaires were given every 2 weeks after delivery over 10 weeks. Milk expression frequency, STS, and socioeconomic variables were collected. RESULT: Infant birthweight, education, and milk expression frequency differed between groups. Trait anxiety, depression and parental stress in a {{neonatal intensive care}} unit (PSS:NICU) were similar. African-American and Caucasian mothers reported the lowest scores in state anxiety and social desirability, respectively. Maternal drive to express milk, measured by maintenance of milk expression, correlated negatively with parental role alteration (subset of PSS:NICU) and positively with infant birthweight and STS. Milk volume correlated negatively with depression and positively with milk expression frequency and STS. CONCLUSION: Differences between groups were observed for certain psychosocial factors. The response bias to self-reported questionnaires between groups may not provide an accurate profile of maternal psychosocial profile. With different factors correlating with maintenance of milk expression and milk volume, lactation performance can be best enhanced with a multi-faceted intervention program, incorporating parental involvement in infant care, <b>close</b> <b>awareness</b> and management of maternal mental health, and encouragement for frequent milk expression and STS...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{provides}} {{a new perspective}} on the construction and use of ontology {{in the context of the}} life cycle of the product. All information related to system-product should be available within the PLM but especially in innovative design phase. Because of the complexity of the information and to increase the effectiveness of the conceptual design the use of ontology is required in a particular domain, the design of machine tools, as a means of representation and classification of knowledge. The ontology is used to define a common vocabulary, explicit, formalized and shared by a community of developers in order to share knowledge and increase the efficiency of the design process. Establishing a taxinomy is the first step of performing a domain ontology of the machine tools. On the other hand, the design process is strongly influenced by the clarity and precision of the analysis of customer needs. To design a product well, design teams needs to know what it is the designing, and what the end-users will expect from it. QFD is a systematic approach to design based on a <b>close</b> <b>awareness</b> of customer desires, coupled with the integration of the functional groups.

To design a product well, a design teams needs to know what it is they are designing, and what the end-users will expect from it. Quality Function Deployment is a systematic approach to design based on a <b>close</b> <b>awareness</b> of customer desires, coupled with the integration of corporate functional groups. It consists in translating customer desires (for example, the ease of writing for a pen) into design characteristics (pen ink viscosity, pressure on ball-point) for each stage of the product development (Rosenthal, 1992). Ultimately the goal of QFD is to translate often subjective quality criteria into objective ones that can be quantified and measured and which can then be used to design and manufacture the product. It is a complimentary method for determining how and where priorities are to be assigned in product development. The intent is to employ objective procedures in increasing detail throughout the development of the product. (Reilly, 1999) Quality Function Deployment was developed by Yoji Akao in Japan in 1966. By 1972 the power of the approach had been well demonstrated at the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Kobe Shipyard (Sullivan, 1986) and in 1978 the first book on the subject was published in Japanese and then later translated into English in 1994 (Mizuno and Akao...|$|R

30|$|At the analysis, {{this focus}} of track {{training}} can be questioned {{in terms of}} the developed skills. Since Poulton [41], the literature on motor learning has distinguished between two main types of skills. The first, so-called “closed skills”, are developed in hazard-free predictable environments {{with a high degree of}} spatial and temporal stability. Actions are not affected by environmental changes, tend to be habitual and the individuals performing them know exactly what to do and when. Track training provides such environments, the “track” is a relatively closed situation (the course does not change, obstacles are positioned in the same way, and there are no other users …) and learning in this context involves learning and stabilizing appropriate motor coordination (maintaining a constant speed, operating the motorcycle controls, positioning of the motorcycle…). In contrast, other skills are developed in “changing” and “dynamic” environments, where actions must be continuously modified to suit the context. This is the case with riding in real traffic where the rider has to cope with dynamic situations (presence of other road users, unusual infrastructure, varying weather conditions and varying traffic density). These skills are called “open skills” and mainly involve perceptive mechanisms, which are almost absent in <b>closed</b> skills (<b>awareness</b> of the situation and risk, anticipation, information processing, decision-making). These open skills represent an important adaptive and responsive element of motorcycle riding activity. Based on this distinction, we can conclude that the teaching of closed skills, and therefore the development of motor abilities in a stable environment, is clearly overvalued in the studied initial motorcycle training to the detriment of the teaching of open skills.|$|R

40|$|Streamers are {{generally}} described as {{regions of the}} corona in which the density is higher than in coronal holes because the plasma is trapped by closed loops of magnetic flux. In contrast, MHD models of the global corona show the plasma beta in streamers above siml. 2 R_S (heliocentric). There are three recent contributions to this topic. The first is that heating near the cusp further drives beta up and results in release of new slow solar wind plasma {{from the top of}} the streamer. The second is SOHO/UVCS observations, in combination with a potential field/source surface model of the magnetic field, that show beta above 1. 2 R_S in a streamer observed near solar sunspot minimum. The third is a magnetic field reconstruction technique that uses field deforming algorithms and is more versatile for local fields than potential field models. The field reconstruction algorithm was applied to an isolated active region (AR 7999) and to the Pneuman Kopp global MHD model (beta has never been published for their model). In the active region, beta becomes larger than unity at siml. 2 R_S. In the Pneuman & Kopp model, beta at the base of the streamer and rises with increasing height, becoming 15 - 20 at 1. 6 R_S and 35 - 50 at 1. 7 R_S. Global simulations go on to show that the reason streamers do not simply explode under such high beta conditions is that they are held down by pressure from the sides due to the magnetic fields (and low beta) in adjacent coronal holes. The main role of the closed magnetic loop near the cusp is to keep the steamer from continuously leaking plasma, as otherwise happens in a magnetic pinch which is similar but has no <b>closed</b> loops. <b>Awareness</b> of MHD physical conditions in streamers is causing us to focus more attention on the details of the heating. On obvious suggestion is that heating is at much lower heights in streamers than in coronal holes. Also, energy which is directly delivered as momentum in coronal holes might all be deposited as heat in streamers...|$|R
40|$|From {{the point}} of view of deontological ethics, privacy is a moral right that {{patients}} are entitled to and it is bound to professional confidentiality. Otherwise, the information given by patients to health professionals would not be reliable and a trustable relationship could not be established. The aim of the present study was to assess, by means of questionnaires with open and <b>closed</b> questions, the <b>awareness</b> and attitudes of 100 dentists working in the city of Andradina, São Paulo State, Brazil, with respect to professional confidentiality in dental practice. Most dentists (91. 43 %) reported to have instructed their assistants on professional confidentiality. However, 44. 29 % of the interviewees showed to act contradictorily as reported talking about the clinical cases of their patients to their friends or spouses. The great majority of professionals (98. 57 %) believed that it is important to have classes on Ethics and Bioethics during graduation and, when asked about their knowledge of the penalties imposed for breach of professional confidentiality, only 48. 57 % of them declared to be aware of it. Only 28. 57 % of the interviewees affirmed to have exclusive access to the files; 67. 14 % reported that that files were also accessed by their secretary; 1. 43 % answered that their spouses also had access, and 2. 86 % did not answer. From the results of the present survey, it could be observed that, although dentists affirmed to be aware of professional confidentiality, their attitudes did not adhere to ethical and legal requirements. This stand of health professionals has contributed to violate professional ethics and the law itself, bringing problems both to the professional and to the patient...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{development}} {{is one of}} the greatest global challenges facing human beings in the 21 st century. In order to tackle sustainability related problems, several global, European, and national targets for 2050 have been set. The transition of supply chains activities towards sustainability targets calls for designing new strategies and continuously identifying and tackling the challenges that can hinder the operationalization of such strategies. The purpose of this research was to explore and classify themes and challenges in developing sustainable supply chains activities in general, and freight transport and urban distribution in particular. Three research questions were defined followed by defining the scientific assumptions and research strategies. Three research studies were then designed and carried out to find trustworthy and authentic answers to the corresponding research questions. However, research design, data collection, and data analysis were mixed and overlapping as they were not completely sequentially carried out. Data were collected by triangulation of different research methods, namely, literature review, content analysis, and semi-structured interviews. Analysis of the data was guided by principles of content analysis, discourse analysis, analytic induction, and grounded theory. Synthesis of the analyzed data resulted in the emergence of categories of themes and challenges, the development of hypotheses, and further discussion. In total, five categories of themes were identified for making supply chains environmentally sustainable, fifteen for making freight transport sustainable, and eight for making urban freight distribution sustainable. Five categories of challenges were identified for making supply chains environmentally sustainable, five for making freight transport sustainable, and seven for making urban freight distribution sustainable. All the themes and challenges were then synthesized to determine the patterns of their association. Five major themes in developing sustainable supply chains emerged, namely, increasing sustainability <b>awareness,</b> <b>closing</b> the loop of supply chains, making supply chains energy-efficient, making supply chains environmentally responsible, and managerial issues. Five major challenges in developing sustainable supply chains emerged, namely, change of behavior, costs, implementation, corporate governance, and antagonistic effects and paradoxical conflicts. As the nature of supply chains and the challenges identified in developing them sustainably is complex, a complexity theory perspective was considered beneficial for dealing with them. Such a perspective can enable us to: take a more holistic view of available sustainability-oriented strategies and activities; analyze the antagonistic effects of strategies and activities on each other; recognize conflicts of a paradoxical character that exist in supply chains; analyze the changes influencing and influenced by the strategies and activities; appreciate enough diversity and freedom among the sub-systems rather than too much simplification of them; design and redesign the transition paths for different types of supply chains. A complexity theory perspective can also be beneficial when governing a transformative transition of supply chains towards sustainability targets. Lessons are suggested in the discussion chapter that may help policy and decision makers in designing the future strategies and in tackling the challenges. The themes identified can be beneficial for increasing the absorptive capacity of industries, practitioners, and policy makers while they design innovative strategies for transitions towards sustainability targets. The identified challenges can also be beneficial for reducing the inertia and uncertainties against operationalization of sustainable development in practice...|$|R
40|$|Citizens well {{informed}} {{about climate change}} make for better polling, argue Alison Atherton and Rebecca Short WORLD WIDE Views on Global Warming Australia {{was part of a}} global citizen deliberation project of the same name. It {{was the first time the}} deliberative method has been used on a global scale. Participants had the chance to access balanced information materials based on up to date science, discuss the issues with each other and, through this hear from a range of competing stakeholders, to help them shape their overall opinions before voting. The aim is to reflect a more considered public view, with one group facilitator describing the ‘eagerness to understand and then to respond and… come up with the best response possible’. About deliberations Citizen deliberation is a tool that has been used regularly by the Danish government (who instigated the World Wide Views event), to learn how citizens feel on a range of issues and what policy makers should do next. It has been valuable in influencing Danish policy, and this project was created to provide useful data for climate negotiators at the United Nations climate talks in Copenhagen in December.   Citizen deliberations have been used successfully in many countries around the world. In Australia, these kinds of processes have been used in discussions over the Australian Republic and on climate change, for example the Green Cross National People’s Assembly on Climate Change. There are clear benefits to making citizen deliberation a regular feature of Australian democracy. World Wide Views proved that Australians are motivated to discuss important issues in an appropriate forum. It can provide policy makers with a direct link to the public and in-depth advice on policy options.   Citizen deliberation does not seek to favour one side or another on an issue; instead the focus is on fostering genuine dialogue between ordinary people, based on access to good information.   Is it just another poll? The citizens’ collated views are emphatically in support of strong climate action.   For example, the support for Australia to join a global deal to curb climate change was 94 %.   89 % supported emissions cuts of 25 % or higher by 2020 for developed countries including Australia. In comparison, the Australian Greens Party released a Galaxy poll on November 15 saying that 54 % of Australians surveyed wanted absolute emissions cuts of 25 % or higher. Recent Pew Centre and Lowy Institute polls imply that interest in climate change is waning. An explanation of the differences between deliberative processes and polling does not lend itself well to pithy media soundbites. In general terms though, a deliberative process provides a much more informed and in-depth view of public opinion than a snapshot poll result. It reflects ordinary people’s views once they’ve had a chance to think over the issues and test their opinions against others.   Through one-on-one briefings with politicians and advisors, and through a short documentary, the Institute for Sustainable Futures is endeavouring to communicate what has been done and what it means on the world stage.   Something that isn’t explicitly built into the process but is often an outcome is the impact on participants’ everyday lives. Participants who were previously ambivalent on the issue can experience personal changes in their views that result in them becoming advocates. As well as the formal voting and other procedures built into the process, World Wide Views captured people’s informal feedback in surveys, on video, and when they were interviewed by their local media. Many said that they had heard about climate change, but didn’t really know what to think, or what the right course of action was. After the event they were more confident in articulating the issues and the possible solutions. One Vietnam Veteran in his 60 s, who said he was a ‘fence sitter’ before attending, now believes “"We are destroying the planet. Scientific results displayed at the event proved global warming was happening," Some did their own press release, several were interviewed by their local paper, and told us that they since fielded comments and questions, mostly supportive, in their community.   One of the participants, with a strong sense of personal spirituality, is speaking on his experience to a group of HSC religious studies students, at an inter-faith seminar. For issues like climate change, which so often remain the province of politicians, experts and policy makers, processes like World Wide Views democratise knowledge and decision-making. Right now, with Copenhagen so <b>close,</b> interest and <b>awareness</b> is being raised through forums all over Australia, like GetUp, 350. org, and others.   World Wide Views however, did not attract people through their passion on climate change or community activism. Instead it randomly selected totally un-connected members of the public and invited them to take part, forming a “mini public”. The final report for the Australian event has just been released and provides detailed facts and stats on how Australians voted and how this compared to the rest of the world.   • Alison Atherton and Rebecca Short are working on the World Wide Views on Global Warming project in Australia  ...|$|R
