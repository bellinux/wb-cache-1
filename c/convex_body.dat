25|$|An {{alternative}} formulation is as follows. Any centrally symmetric <b>convex</b> <b>body</b> {{of surface}} area A can be squeezed through a noose of length , with the tightest fit achieved by a sphere.

25|$|The Koebe–Andreev–Thurston circle packing theorem can be {{interpreted}} as providing another strengthening of Steinitz's theorem, that every 3-connected planar graph may be represented as a convex polyhedron {{in such a way that}} all of its edges are tangent to the same unit sphere. By performing a carefully chosen Möbius transformation of a circle packing before transforming it into a polyhedron, it is possible to find a polyhedral realization that realizes all the symmetries of the underlying graph, in the sense that every graph automorphism is a symmetry of the polyhedral realization. More generally, if G is a polyhedral graph and K is any smooth three-dimensional <b>convex</b> <b>body,</b> it is possible to find a polyhedral representation of G in which all edges are tangent to K.|$|E
