Macrophages play {{a very important role}} in secondary injury. The effects of macrophages on tissue damage and repair after SCI are related to macrophage polarization. Stem cell transplantation has been studied as a promising treatment for SCI. Recently, increasing evidence shows that stem cells, including mesenchymal stem, neural stem/progenitor, and embryonic stem cells, have an anti-inflammatory capacity and promote functional recovery after SCI by inducing macrophages M 1 /M 2 phenotype transformation. In this review, we will discuss the role of stem cells on macrophage polarization and its role in stem cell-based therapies for SCI.

40|$|The article {{explores the}} {{contemporary}} dynamics of global scientific multipolarisation, and the empirical and theoretical {{implications of this}} trend for international clinical research collaborations. The {{focal point of the}} article is an ethnographic study of the <b>China</b> Spinal <b>Cord</b> Injury Network (<b>China</b> SCI Net), a transcontinental clinical research infrastructure that is active in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the US. Based on findings from this case study, the author suggests that the transition toward a multipolarising science world is associated with significant changes in the ways international collaborations are initiated, organised and justified. For many years, clinical research collaborations between partners in high- and low-to-middle-income countries have involved geographically bound hierarchies between the sponsors, intellectual creators and facilitating technicians of the research. However, the data from the China SCI Net indicate that these boundaries are in important respects transcending, and that a new modality of international clinical research organisation may gradually be taking shape. Theoretically, this article engages in a reflective dialogue with post-colonial theory, and post-colonial science and technology studies. The author suggests that several of the analytical tools that post-colonial science studies offer remain of great relevancy also {{in the context of a}} multipolarising science world. Simultaneously, however, the conceptual, methodological and ideological presumptions embedded in post-colonial theory require careful scrutiny, and other complementary strategies are required to capture the impact of the current multipolarisation process in the sciences more completely...|$|R

Currently, neurorestorative strategies, including stem cell therapy products or mature/functionally differentiated cell-derived cell therapy products, can restore {{patients with chronic}} complete SCI to some degree of neurological functions. The stem cells for neurorestoration include neural stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, etc. A {{better understanding of the}} merits, demerits and precise function of different stem cells in the treatment of SCI may aid in the development of neurorestorative strategies. However, the efficacy, safety and ethical concerns of stem cell-based therapy continue to be challenged. Nonetheless, stem cell-based therapies hold promise of widespread applications, particularly in areas of SCI, and have the potential to be novel therapeutics, which contributes to the repair of SCI. This review mainly focused on recent advances regarding the stem cell-based therapies in the treatment of SCI and discussed future perspectives in this field.
