5|$|All {{elements}} {{in this group}} are metals. The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend in this group is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly {{from top to bottom}} of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the <b>conduction</b> <b>band.</b> Thus, zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.|$|E
5|$|Silver has a {{brilliant}} white metallic luster {{that can take}} a high polish, and which is so characteristic that {{the name of the}} metal itself has become a colour name. Unlike copper and gold, the energy required to excite an electron from the filled d band to the s-p <b>conduction</b> <b>band</b> in silver is large enough (around 385kJ/mol) that it no longer corresponds to absorption in the visible region of the spectrum, but rather in the ultraviolet; hence silver is not a coloured metal. Protected silver has greater optical reflectivity than aluminium at all wavelengths longer than ~450nm. At wavelengths shorter than 450nm, silver's reflectivity is inferior to that of aluminium and drops to zero near 310nm.|$|E

It is found that the enhancement of the spin–orbit coupling due to the hybridization of Bi 6 p is considerably larger in the Fe 3 d <b>conduction</b> <b>bands</b> than in the O 2 p and Fe 3 d valence bands. The origin of this enhancement is that the Fe 3 d <b>conduction</b> <b>bands</b> energetically overlap with Bi 6 p bands.

25|$|Photons {{hitting a}} thin film of alkali metal or {{semiconductor}} material such as gallium arsenide in an image intensifier tube cause the ejection of photoelectrons due to the photoelectric effect. These are accelerated by an electrostatic field where they strike a phosphor coated screen, converting the electrons back into photons. Intensification of the signal is achieved either through acceleration of the electrons or by {{increasing the number of}} electrons through secondary emissions, such as with a micro-channel plate. Sometimes a combination of both methods is used. Additional kinetic energy is required to move an electron out of the <b>conduction</b> <b>band</b> and into the vacuum level. This is known as the electron affinity of the photocathode and is another barrier to photoemission other than the forbidden band, explained by the band gap model. Some materials such as Gallium Arsenide have an effective electron affinity that is below the level of the <b>conduction</b> <b>band.</b> In these materials, electrons that move to the <b>conduction</b> <b>band</b> are all of sufficient energy to be emitted from the material and as such, the film that absorbs photons can be quite thick. These materials are known as negative electron affinity materials.|$|E
25|$|When {{placed in}} the sun, photons of the {{sunlight}} can excite electrons on the p-type side of the semiconductor, {{a process known as}} photoexcitation. In silicon, sunlight can provide enough energy to push an electron out of the lower-energy valence band into the higher-energy <b>conduction</b> <b>band.</b> As the name implies, electrons in the <b>conduction</b> <b>band</b> are free to move about the silicon. When a load is placed across the cell as a whole, these electrons will flow out of the p-type side into the n-type side, lose energy while moving through the external circuit, and then flow back into the p-type material where they can once again re-combine with the valence-band hole they left behind. In this way, sunlight creates an electric current.|$|E

Specifically, zigzag systems can present the anti-ferromagnetic ordering across two edges, ferromagnetic ordering along one edge and non-magnetism, being reflected in the edge-localized energy bands with or without spin splitting.

50|$|Diodes are {{electrical}} {{semiconductor devices}} that allow electric current flow {{in one direction}} more than the other. The device depends on a depletion layer between N-type and P-type semiconductors to serve its purpose; when these are very heavily doped the depletion layer can be thin enough for tunnelling. Then, when a small forward bias is applied the current due to tunnelling is significant. This has a maximum {{at the point where}} the voltage bias is such that the energy level of the p and n <b>conduction</b> <b>bands</b> are the same.

25|$|Use of the {{empirical}} CFE equation (42), and {{the measurement of}} κ, may be of particular use for non-metals. Strictly, Fowler-Nordheim-type equations apply only to emission from the <b>conduction</b> <b>band</b> of bulk crystalline solids. However, empirical equations of form (42) should apply to all materials (though, conceivably, modification might be needed for very sharp emitters). It seems very likely that {{one way in which}} CFE equations for newer materials may differ from Fowler-Nordheim-type equations is that these CFE equations may have a different power of F (or V) in their pre-exponentials. Measurements of κ might provide some experimental indication of this.|$|E
25|$|Oppenheimer had {{predicted}} that the field-induced tunneling of electrons from atoms (the effect now called field ionization) would have this i(V) dependence, had found this dependence in the published experimental field emission results of Millikan and Eyring, and proposed that CFE was due to field-induced tunneling of electrons from atomic-like orbitals in surface metal atoms. An alternative Fowler–Nordheim theory explained both the Millikan-Lauritsen finding and the very weak dependence of current on temperature. Fowler–Nordheim theory predicted both to be consequences if CFE were due to field-induced tunneling from free-electron-type states in what we would now call a metal <b>conduction</b> <b>band,</b> with the electron states occupied in accordance with Fermi–Dirac statistics.|$|E
25|$|At {{standard}} temperature and pressure, silicon is a shiny semiconductor with a bluish-grey metallic lustre; as typical for semiconductors, its resistivity drops with temperature. This arises because silicon {{has a small}} energy gap between its highest occupied energy levels (the valence band) and the lowest unoccupied ones (the <b>conduction</b> <b>band).</b> The Fermi level is about halfway between these and is the energy at which a state is {{as likely to be}} occupied by an electron as not. Hence pure silicon is an insulator at room temperature. However, doping silicon with a pnictogen such as phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony introduces one extra electron per dopant and these may then be excited into the <b>conduction</b> <b>band</b> either thermally or photolytically, creating an n-type semiconductor. Similarly, doping silicon with a group 13 element such as boron, aluminium, and gallium results in the introduction of acceptor levels that trap electrons that may be excited from the filled valence band, creating a p-type semiconductor. Joining n-type silicon to p-type silicon creates a p-n junction with a common Fermi level; electrons flow from n to p, while holes flow from p to n, creating a voltage drop. This p-n junction thus acts as a diode that can rectify alternating curent that allows current to pass more easily one way than the other. A transistor is an n-p-n junction, with a thin layer of weakly p-type silicon between two n-type regions. Biasing the emitter through a small forward voltage and the collector through a large reverse voltage allows the transistor to act as a triode amplifier.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{magneto-optical}} (MO) response of polar semiconductor BiTeI with giant bulk Rashba spin splitting at various carrier densities. Despite being non-magnetic, {{the material is}} found to yield a huge MO activity in the infrared region under moderate magnetic fields (< 3 T). By comparison with first-principles calculations, we show that such an enhanced MO response is mainly due to the intraband transitions between the Rashba-split bulk <b>conduction</b> <b>bands</b> in BiTeI, which give rise to distinct novel features and systematic doping dependence of the MO spectra. We further predict an even more pronounced enhancement in the low-energy MO response and dc Hall effect near the crossing (Dirac) point of the <b>conduction</b> <b>bands...</b>|$|R
25|$|At larger {{gate bias}} still, near the {{semiconductor}} surface the <b>conduction</b> <b>band</b> edge is brought {{close to the}} Fermi level, populating the surface with electrons in an inversion layer or n-channel at the interface between the p region and the oxide. This conducting channel extends between the source and the drain, and current is conducted through it when a voltage is applied between the two electrodes. Increasing the voltage on the gate leads to a higher electron density in the inversion layer and therefore increases the current flow between the source and drain. For gate voltages below the threshold value, the channel is lightly populated, and {{only a very small}} subthreshold leakage current can flow between the source and the drain.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} metals in their solid state {{helps to explain}} the unusually high {{electrical}} conductivity of copper. In a copper atom, the outermost 4s energy zone, or <b>conduction</b> <b>band,</b> is only half filled, so many electrons are able to carry electric current. When an electric field is applied to a copper wire, the conduction of electrons accelerates towards the electropositive end, thereby creating a current. These electrons encounter resistance to their passage by colliding with impurity atoms, vacancies, lattice ions, and imperfections. The average distance travelled between collisions, defined as the “mean free path,” is inversely proportional to the resistivity of the metal. What is unique about copper is its long mean free path (approximately 100 atomic spacings at room temperature). This mean free path increases rapidly as copper is chilled.|$|E

The dicarbides with exception of EuC2, are metallic conductors with the calcium carbide structure and can be formulated as Ln3+C22−(e–). The C-C bond length is longer than that in CaC2, which contains the C22− anion, indicating that the antibonding orbitals of the C22− anion {{are involved in the}} <b>conduction</b> <b>band.</b> These dicarbides hydrolyse to form hydrogen and a mixture of hydrocarbons. EuC2 {{and to a lesser extent}} YbC2 hydrolyse differently producing a higher percentage of acetylene (ethyne). The sesquicarbides, Ln2C3 can be formulated as Ln4(C2)3. These compounds adopt the Pu2C3 structure which has been described as having C22− anions in bisphenoid holes formed by eight near Ln neighbours. The lengthening of the C-C bond is less marked in the sesquicarbides than in the dicarbides, with the exception of Ce2C3.|$|E
40|$|In {{this chapter}} the {{strength}} of electronic correlations in the normal phase of Fe-superconductors is discussed. It will be shown that the agreement between a wealth of experiments and DFT+DMFT or similar approaches supports a scenario in which strongly-correlated and weakly-correlated electrons coexist in the <b>conduction</b> <b>bands</b> of these materials. I will then reverse-engineer the realistic calculations and justify this scenario in terms of simpler behaviors easily interpreted through model results. All pieces come together to show that Hund's coupling, besides being responsible for the electronic correlations even in absence of a strong Coulomb repulsion is also the origin of a subtle emergent behavior: orbital decoupling. Indeed Hund's exchange decouples the charge excitations in the different Iron orbitals involved in the <b>conduction</b> <b>bands</b> thus causing an independent tuning {{of the degree of}} electronic correlation in each one of them. The latter becomes sensitive almost only to the offset of the orbital population from half-filling, where a Mott insulating state is invariably realized at these interaction strengths. Depending on the difference in orbital population a different 'Mottness' affects each orbital, and thus reflects in the <b>conduction</b> <b>bands</b> and in the Fermi surfaces depending on the orbital content.

An increase of Qf leads to an increase of calcium selectivity: L 0 (sodium-selective, nonblocking channel) → M 0 (nonselective channel) → L 1 (sodium-selective channel with divalent block) → M 1 (calcium-selective channel exhibiting the anomalous mole fraction effect). We create a consistent identification scheme where the L 0 band is putatively identified with the eukaryotic sodium channel The scheme created is able to account for the experimentally observed mutation-induced transformations between nonselective channels, sodium selective channels, and calcium-selective channels, which we interpret as transitions between different rows of the identification table. By considering the potential energy changes during permeation, we show explicitly that the multi-ion <b>conduction</b> <b>bands</b> of calcium and sodium channels arise as the result of resonant barrierless conduction. The pattern of periodic <b>conduction</b> <b>bands</b> is explained on the basis of sequential neutralization taking account of self-energy, as Qf (z,i) = ze(1 / 2 + i), where i is the order of the band and z is the valence of the ion.
