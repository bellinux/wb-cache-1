5|$|On October 10, the Americans {{spotted a}} large house in Yorktown. Believing that Cornwallis might be {{stationed}} there, they aimed {{at it and}} quickly destroyed it. Cornwallis sank {{more than a dozen}} of his ships in the harbor. The French began to fire at the British ships and scored a hit on the British HMS Charon, which caught fire, and in turn set two or three other ships on fire. Cornwallis received word from <b>Clinton</b> <b>that</b> the British fleet was to depart on October 12, however Cornwallis responded by saying {{that he would not be}} able to hold out for long.|$|E
5|$|Cornwallis {{pulled back}} from all of his outer defenses, except for the Fusilier's redoubt {{on the west side}} of the town and redoubts 9 and 10 in the east. Cornwallis had his forces occupy the {{earthworks}} immediately surrounding the town because he had received a letter from <b>Clinton</b> <b>that</b> promised relief force of 5,000 men within a week and he wished to tighten his lines. The Americans and the French occupied the abandoned defenses and began to establish their own batteries there. With the British outer defenses in their hands, allied engineers began to lay out positions for the artillery. The men improved their works and deepened their trenches. The British also worked on improving their defenses.|$|E
5000|$|He {{has criticized}} Bill <b>Clinton,</b> writing <b>that</b> <b>Clinton</b> pandered to the African-American vote, and then benefited from {{receiving}} {{a majority of}} it in the 1992 general election.

50|$|In March 1992, {{during his}} presidential campaign, the <b>Clintons</b> {{acknowledged}} <b>that</b> on their 1984 and 1985 tax returns, they had claimed improper tax deductions for interest payments {{made by the}} Whitewater Development Company.

5|$|During {{the early}} months of 1781, both pro-British and separatist forces began concentrating in Virginia, a state that had {{previously}} not experienced more than naval raids. The British forces were led at first by the turncoat Benedict Arnold, and then by William Phillips before General Charles, Earl Cornwallis, arrived in late May with his southern army to take command. In June he marched to Williamsburg, where he received a confusing series of orders from General Sir Henry <b>Clinton</b> <b>that</b> culminated in a directive to establish a fortified deep-water port (which would allow resupply by sea). In response to these orders, Cornwallis moved to Yorktown in late July, where his army began building fortifications. The presence of these British troops, coupled with General Clinton's desire for a port there, made control of the Chesapeake Bay an essential naval objective for both sides.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of I-287's New Jersey portion in 1993, more out-of-state tractor trailer drivers began to use the alignment of Route31 as a toll-free alternative to the New Jersey Turnpike. On July 16, 1999, oversize trucks were banned from using Route31 {{as part of a}} larger statewide ban imposed on New Jersey roads not a part of the National Highway System by then-governor Christine Todd Whitman. The legislation had a significant effect on trucks that followed Route31 as it forced them to use I-287 and the New Jersey Turnpike instead. In themid-2000s, the portion of Route31 was widened during extensive construction between Flemington and <b>Clinton</b> <b>that</b> widened the road to four lanes.|$|E
