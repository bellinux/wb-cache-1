40|$|In this study, {{we design}} a {{learning}} environment to foster participants ’ creative attitude and evaluate its effectiveness {{in a university}} class. Our educational program consists of the following three phases: (1) introduction (studying the basics of Mindstorms used as a tool), (2) creative activities (producing playground equipment using Mindstorms), and (3) self-reflective activities on the creative processes (each group constructing a diagram describing their own creative processes and discussing the processes). We evaluate the effectiveness based on comparisons of pre- and post-tests and {{the contents of the}} participants ’ discussions. In particular, we <b>confirm</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> three learning activities: (1) the participants discussed their creative activities from various viewpoints, (2) they also discussed the viewpoints considered to be important for creative activities, and (3) they realized the importance of idea generation, idea embodiment, and collaboration in creative activities.

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that the city-size {{distributions}} are fat tailed, drawing the interest of urban economists. In contrast, not much is known about the distribution of GDP at city level (henceforth referred to as gross metropolitan product, GMP). We build a model of the spatial economy that includes production and <b>confirm</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> empirical facts about the GMP counterpart of the city-size distribution. First, both Zipf's and Gibrat's law hold for the distribution of GMP as well. In particular the GMP distribution is well-traced by a lognormal distribution. Second, citywide aggregate production exhibits increasing returns to scale with respect to employment. In particular a 1 % increase in employment leads to a 1. 117 % (or 1. 180 % in theory) increase in GMP.

40|$|In this paper, we {{estimate}} Japanese firms ' exchange rate exposure and investigate {{the impact of}} exchange rate risk management on them. By using {{the results of the}} questionnaire survey sent to all Tokyo Stock Exchange listed firms in 2009, we conduct empirical analysis to investigate whether each risk management tool—financial and operational hedging, the choice of invoice currency, and the price revision strategy (pass-through) —specifically affects their foreign exchange exposure. As a result, we <b>confirm</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> characteristics: first, firms with larger dependency on foreign markets have larger foreign exchange exposure. Second, the higher is the U. S. dollar invoicing share, the larger is the foreign exchange exposure, but it is reduced by using both financial and operational hedging. Third, yen invoicing itself reduces the foreign exchange exposure. These findings indicate that Japanese firms utilize operational and financial hedging strategies and price revision policy depending on their choice of invoicing currency...|$|E

We <b>confirm</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> facts: First, {{there is a positive}} correlation between ICT investment and economic growth. Second, non-ICT investment has as much influence on the growth gap as ICT investment. Third, those countries with a solid economic infrastructure and open trade regime experience more active ICT investments. Fourth, those countries with a comparatively lower productivity level can reduce the gap using knowledge spillovers from more advanced countries. Fifth, reinforcement of patent rights has a positive influence on economic growth by stimulating the accumulation of ICT capital. Finally, ICT investment does not have a strong interdependent relationship with economic growth, while non-ICT investment has a cumulative causal relationship with economic growth and {{plays a key role in}} the process of widening the growth gap.

Researchers have accumulated much evidence {{on the importance of}} appropriate representations for the efficiency of AI systems. The same problem may be easy or difficult, depending on the way we describe it and on the search algorithm we use. Previous work on the automatic improvement of problem descriptions has mostly been limited to the design of individual learning algorithms. The user has traditionally been responsible for the choice of algorithms appropriate for a given problem.
