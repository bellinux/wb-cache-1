25|$|In 2008, Substation Curaçao {{purchased}} Chapman {{to refurbish}} her and modify her {{for use as}} a seagoing mothership for the deep-diving scientific and tourist submarine Curasub. Modifications involved the installation of amenities for embarked scientists and tourists and of a 110-ton knuckle boom crane on Chapmans after deck to launch and retrieve both the submarine and its floating dock, both of which can be carried on Chapmans after deck. During submarine operations, the floating dock is lowered over the side and secured to Chapman so that Curasubs passengers have an easy and convenient way to embark on and disembark from the submarine without the danger of launching Curasub into the water with them already aboard; Curasub also is lowered over the side and operates from the floating dock, which includes a docking cradle for the submarine.

The performance of the spectrometer was established using α‐particle sources and nuclear‐reaction products from heavy‐ion collisions. The characteristics of air‐core magnets are compared to those of steel‐yoke magnets. The simplicity and ease of operation of the air‐core magnet, without significant problems from the (axial) fringe fields, suggests that larger air‐core magnets with dΩ≥ 20 msr and capable of focusing ions with E/A≥ 30 MeV/u are feasible. Other applications of solenoids and combinations of solenoids with radial electric‐field lenses (ELCO lenses) are also discussed, including designs which focus more than one charge state simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the analysis and}} design of a precision voltage reference (PVR) based upon a micromechanical resonator. The precision voltage reference consists of two closed loop controllers and a nonlinear resonator. The oscillator loop maintains oscillations in the resonator. The phase locked loop is a frequency control loop that locks the resonator frequency to an external frequency. The micromechanical device consists {{of a pair of}} resonators that are electrostatically driven and sensed in their out-of-plane vibrational resonance mode. The oscillating proof masses move on flexure beams and the resonator is <b>configured</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>as</b> a voltage controlled oscillator within the phase locked loop. The first order stiffness coefficient has an electrostatic component that reduces the frequency of oscillation with increasing bias voltage applied to the resonator. The resonator's frequency sensitivity to voltage is realized by the first order, bias voltage dependent stiffness coefficient. The input bias voltage to the voltage controlled oscillator is the precision voltage reference. A prototype PVR device was constructed and the PVR operation confirmed. Result...|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} the efforts and progress {{in developing a}} 'system-level' integrated circuit, or SLIC, for application in advanced phased array antenna systems. The SLIC combines radio-frequency (RF) microelectronics, digital and analog support circuitry, and photonic interfaces into a single micro-hybrid assembly. Together, these technologies provide not only the amplitude and phase control necessary for electronic beam steering in the phased array, but also add thermally-compensated automatic gain control, health and status feedback, bias regulation, and reduced interconnect complexity. All circuitry is integrated into a compact, multilayer structure <b>configured</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>as</b> a two-by-four element phased array module, operating at 20 Gigahertz, using a Microwave High-Density Interconnect (MHDI) process. The resultant hardware is constructed without conventional wirebonds, maintains tight inter-element spacing, and leads toward low-cost mass production. The measured performances and development issues associated with both the two-by-four element module and the constituent elements are presented. Additionally, {{a section of the}} report describes alternative architectures and applications supported by the SLIC electronics. Test results show excellent yield and performance of RF circuitry and full automatic gain control for multiple, independent channels. Digital control function, while suffering from lower manufacturing yield, also proved successful...|$|E

40|$|Anthrax, {{a disease}} usually {{associated}} with herbivores, {{is caused by the}} bacterium Bacillus anthracis. The current vaccine licensed for human use requires a six-dose primary series and yearly boosters and causes reactogenicity in up to 30 % of vaccine recipients. A minimally reactogenic vaccine requiring fewer inoculations is warranted. Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus has been <b>configured</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>as</b> a vaccine vector {{for a wide variety of}} immunogens. The VEE vaccine vector is composed of a self-replicating RNA (replicon) containing all of the VEE virus nonstructural genes and a multiple-cloning site in place of the VEE structural genes. Four different anthrax vaccines were constructed by cloning the protective antigen (PA) gene from B. anthracis into the VEE vaccine vector. The anthrax vaccines were produced by assembling the vectors into propagation-deficient VEE replicon particles in vitro. A/J mice inoculated subcutaneously with three doses of the mature 83 -kDa PA vaccine were completely protected from challenge with the Sterne strain of B. anthracis. Similar results were obtained with vaccines composed of the PA gene fused to either the B. anthracis secretory sequence or to a tissue plasminogen activator secretory sequence in three additional mouse strains. Mice were unprotected from challenge after inoculation with the carboxy-terminal 63 -kDa PA vaccine. These results suggest that these VEE-vectored vaccines may be suitable as candidate vaccines against anthrax...|$|E
40|$|Gas {{sensitive}} semiconductors {{have been}} known {{for many years and}} applied in static gas alarm systems for the monitoring of hazardous gases, however, their application has been limited by a lack of selectivity. In this work a semiconducting gas sensor has been <b>configured</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>as</b> a gas chromatographic detector thus combining the sensitivity of semiconductor sensors with the selectivity of gas chromatography. The study has been confined to tin oxide devices, more specifically the Taguchi gas sensor (TGS). The majority of this work has concentrated on the TGS 813 although the use of other TGS is described. The development of suitable instrumentation is described and rigorous optimisation of the operating parameters e. g. heater voltage and column temperature has been performed using the variable step size simplex technique. Attention was concentrated on the response of the TGS 813 to hydrogen which was used as a test gas. A novel figure of merit, response multiplied by retention time and divided by skew factor was designed so that optimum response was obtained whilst maintaining adequate chromatographic separation. Optimum conditions were verified by univariate searches and the response was observed to be most dependant upon heater voltage. A limit of detection of 20 ppb v/v of hydrogen in a 1 ml sample was obtained at optimal conditions. Illustrative analyses of hydrogen were performed in human breath and laboratory air with results found to be in close agreement with literature values. Calibration was found to be linear over at least three orders of magnitude. The response of the TGS 813 to low molecular weight alkanes has also been investigated. It was observed that different heater voltage optima existed for each of the C 1 -C 5 alkanes and that the sensor was relatively more sensitive to the higher molecular weight compounds. As with hydrogen linear response was obtained over at least three orders of magnitude and an illustrative analysis of natural gas showed excellent agreement with known levels. A compromise optimum heater voltage was used to study the response of the TGS 813 to alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and some Cs hydrocarbons. Capillary columns were used in this investigation and it was noted that they had potentially wider application than packed columns due to the use of an inert carrier with an air make-up flow to the detector. This replaced the air carrier gas used previously which might degrade certain stationary phases. Three different types of TGS: the 813; 822 and 831 were used in a study of the response and skew factor for the detection of halogen-containing compounds. Very high skew factors were often observed, although, for some compounds it appeared that symmetrical peaks could be obtained within narrow heater voltage ranges. Skewed response was observed to be dependant upon sensor type, heater voltage and halogen proportion and type. Analysis of the three sensor types was performed and differences in potential surface area and tin oxide additives observed. The presence of additives was observed to adversely affect sensor recovery. Philips Scientific, York Street, Cambridge CBl 2 P...|$|E
