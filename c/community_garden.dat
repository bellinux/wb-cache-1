5|$|By 2005, the disused eastern {{trackbed}} {{was filled}} with rubble, brambles and weeds, and the station had acquired a bad reputation due to muggings {{and the use of}} illegal drugs on the station premises. A <b>community</b> <b>garden</b> project, Eastside Roots, was set up in the disused trackbed by local permaculture enthusiast Nick Ward. It was built using sustainable materials, including bricks dug out during the construction of the Cabot Circus shopping centre. The project led to a general improvement of the station ambience, and residents were more willing to use it. The footbridge was replaced in 2013 to allow for electrification of the line, but the new, higher, bridge angered local residents who felt it infringed on their privacy.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the practice of}} <b>community</b> <b>gardening</b> using neoliberalism as a theoretical tool. The word <b>community</b> <b>gardening</b> probably evokes positive images to many people. Images such as children digging up the soil or people gathering around a vegetable garden {{in the middle of}} a city cannot seem to be controversial. <b>Community</b> <b>gardens,</b> where people share a piece of land to produce food, are increasingly attracting interest. In addition to providing fresh vegetables and fruits or outdoor recreations, <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> are often portrayed as an agent of social change to address issues related to food security, the environment, or community building. However, this thesis aims to identify possible neoliberal notions in the practice of <b>community</b> <b>gardening.</b> The interviews conducted with on-site leaders and outside supporters of <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> in this case study revealed both the traits of neoliberalism and the resistance to it. While it is hard to deny the benefits that <b>community</b> <b>gardening</b> might realize for its participants, <b>community</b> <b>gardening</b> cannot replace safety net programs such as food stamps or school lunch programs that address food insecurity. I conclude that public policy should tackle fundamental issues of inequality, poverty and hunger because <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> can only be part of the solution, if at all, for food insecurity among low-income households...|$|R

40|$|Urban Agriculture in <b>Community</b> <b>Gardens</b> is an {{increasing}} phenomenon around the world. Gothenburg is following this trend. Extensive research on <b>Community</b> <b>Gardens</b> globally, shows that there are various objectives behind cultivating in cities. For poor people, Urban Agriculture may be a strategy of survival. Some <b>Community</b> <b>Gardens</b> {{around the world are}} described as community projects, others are analysed to work as spaces of resistance in urban landscapes. However, there is little research done on <b>Community</b> <b>Gardens</b> in Gothenburg. Accordingly, by conducting a qualitative study, interviewing six urban farmers, this thesis attempts to paint a picture of motives behind <b>Community</b> <b>Gardens</b> in Gothenburg. The theoretical lens of the thesis is that globalization is transforming cities and the people that live in them. Moreover, it is believed that globalization leads to counter-actions on the local level. These processes are assumed to be observed, also in Gothenburg. Thus, the main intent of this thesis is to explore motives behind Urban Agriculture in <b>Community</b> <b>Gardens</b> in Gothenburg, and how Urban Agriculture in <b>Community</b> <b>Gardens</b> may be described as counter-acts to globalization...|$|R

40|$|Low-income {{communities}} and communities of color often lack access to fresh food from large food retailers within the traditional food system. Growing public concern for {{these and other}} food inequalities across the U. S. has generated interest in alternate food outlets such as <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> as solutions. However, recent scholarly work suggests that <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> may be more prevalent in predominately white or higher-income communities. This research further suggests that the primary goals and ideology that drive the development of <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> may resonate more with white higher-income participants than lower-income or racial minorities. As a result, the participants in these programs are often primarily white, high-income individuals. By using negative binomial and spatial regression techniques to examine data from New York City and Minnesota, the current research project aims to clarify to what degree communities of color and low-income communities face a {{lack of access to}} <b>community</b> <b>gardens.</b> Further, this research investigates variation in the ideology or framing associated with <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> with different demographic profiles. Findings suggest low-income {{communities and}} communities of color do not lack access to <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> at a higher rate than white and high-income communities. However, findings show that the goals and ideology of <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> vary across <b>communities</b> with different demographics. This research develops a more nuanced understanding of the race and class-based barriers to participating in <b>community</b> <b>gardens.</b> It adds to the literature on food access by revealing the degree to which <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> as alternative, local food programs are accessible and welcoming to low-income, black, and Latino individuals, who have historically experienced barriers to accessing healthy food. Findings suggest that more work could be done to ensure accessibility to <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> in less educated <b>communities,</b> and that <b>gardens</b> in more diverse communities could focus more on the benefits valued by black Americans and Latinos to ensure these groups feel welcome in the gardens...|$|R

40|$|The study {{examines}} social and physical connections and images {{that define the}} sense of place of three <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> managed by the City of Portland. Most research on <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> focuses on social group connections {{and their impact on}} community revitalization and empowerment. Few studies consider the impact of physical and social connections to <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> from the perspective of individual gardeners in constructing their sense of place. No studies have yet examined the relationship between spatial images, space connections, and empowerment feelings related to <b>community</b> <b>gardens.</b> This study is intended to initiate a discussion on the empowerment experience of individual gardeners and their images associated with <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> in the context of sense of place. Thirty gardeners participated in the study. The use of the narrative photo storytelling method applied through de Certeau 2 ̆ 7 s practice of everyday life and narrative city approach enabled gardeners to express in their own terms connections to space and experience of empowerment achieved through <b>community</b> <b>gardening.</b> The study proposes the concept of the Natural Realm as the context for sense of place of Portland <b>Community</b> <b>gardens.</b> Natural Realm deemphasizes the human-centric view of nature. Community gardeners most commonly experience empowerment by perceiving <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> as sacred places where people feel well because they can grow healthy food, practice green domesticity, and learn from nature in a beautiful setting. The study applies Rocha 2 ̆ 7 s ladder of empowerment to examine the relevance of individual and group action in fulfilling empowerment goals in the context of sense of place.

40|$|Study purpose. The study {{examined}} race and racial diversity in <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> located in Southern urban food deserts, {{as well as}} the capacity of <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> to generate social capital and promote social justice. Methods. A mixed-methods approach was used to describe characteristics of gardeners and <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> located in urban food deserts, and test Social Capital Theory hypotheses. A convenience sample of 60 gardeners from 10 <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> was obtained. Data was collected using surveys and semi-structured interviews. Analyses. Univariate and bivariate statistics were used to describe gardeners and gardens. Leader rationales for garden characteristics were analyzed using thematic analysis. Cross-level analyses were used to examine individual and organizational characteristics on gardeners’ social capital in multivariate regression models. Results. Gardeners were racially diverse across the sample; however most <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> were racially segregated. The majority of gardeners also appeared to be middle-class. This study indicated that <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> could indirectly enhance community food security, largely through the efforts of people of color, and less so directly as few gardeners involved were food insecure. <b>Community</b> <b>gardens</b> also exhibited limited potential to advance social justice, based on the few resources that could potentially be exchanged between gardeners. Implications. This study calls for: greater dialogue around gentrification concerns; the development of culturally appropriate engagement sensitive to historical trauma rooted in slavery; increased focus on entrepreneurial opportunities; and, obtaining the missing voices – those from non-participating low-income residents – to better understand how to create <b>community</b> <b>gardens</b> located in food deserts that benefit multiple communities...|$|R
