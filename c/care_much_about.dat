500|$|Donoghue {{wrote in}} The New York Times {{that he did}} not <b>care</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> what {{happened}} to Alice and her comrades. He felt that Lessing presents Alice as [...] "an unquestioned rigmarole of reactions and prejudices", which leaves no room for any further interest. Donoghue complained that Lessing has not made up her mind on whether her characters are [...] "the salt of the earth or its scum". In a review in the Chicago Tribune, Kuehn felt that the work has little impact and is not memorable. He said Lessing's real interest is character development, but complained that the characters are [...] "trivial or two-dimensional or crippled by self-delusions".|$|E
500|$|The {{innovator}} {{does not}} tend to <b>care</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> free speech, since {{they engage in}} innovation despite social resistance. Innovators may be separated into three categories: the hard millenarians, who believe in their doctrine {{to the exclusion of}} all others, and who only seek to protect the dissemination of their own creeds; the virtuous millenarians, who emphasise that revolutionary transitions must begin through rational persuasion and the guidance of sages, and so are supportive of free speech; and the progressives, who cannot foresee the direction of future progress, but recognise that the free exchange of ideas is a prerequisite to it. For the philosopher, free speech allows people to engage in rational doubt, and to grow in their prudential duties. (Russell 1938:182–185) ...|$|E

500|$|Bahrain became {{independent}} from the United Kingdom in 1971 and the Constituent Assembly of 1972 had drafted {{a new constitution}} by 1973. Like his study colleague Isa Qassim, al-Jamri initially wanted to complete his religious studies and did not <b>care</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> politics. His mentor in Iraq, Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr, issued a binding fatwā {{for participation in the}} 1973 parliamentary election. Al-Jamri and five others formed the [...] "Religious Bloc" [...] which adopted a wide program including supporting the labor's union and demands, forbidding trade of alcoholic beverages, and separating men and women in education institutes. The bloc also called for prohibiting male doctors from treating female patients (especially in pregnancy) as well as other demands connected to traditional Islamic customs. Al-Jamri was elected to the National Assembly of Bahrain, ranking second behind Isa Qassim.|$|E
500|$|In past years, October {{also was}} when eagerly {{anticipated}} horror films reached screens, {{to capitalize on}} the approach of Halloween {{at the end of the}} month. However, this began to change in the 2000s due to the way franchises such as the Saw and Paranormal Activity films dominated that period, prompting distributors of other horror films to consider releasing them during the winter dump months instead. In 2012 Paramount enjoyed huge success with the unheralded The Devil Inside, released right after New Year's Day despite a strongly negative critical and audience reaction; the next year Mama was received enthusiastically by critics and filmgoers when it came out on Martin Luther King Day weekend after being rescheduled from the previous October to avoid going up against Sinister and Paranormal Activity 4. Only one major horror film, the third adaptation of Stephen King's Carrie, was released in October 2013, and it underperformed. [...] "At your local multiplex, the spirit of Halloween is, sadly, dead," [...] Matt Barone wrote in Complex. [...] "Horror's now too big of a business for major studios to <b>care</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> October." ...|$|E
500|$|As a Polish {{delegate}} at the Paris Peace Conference and a signatory of the Versailles Treaty, Dmowski exerted {{a substantial}} {{influence on the}} Treaty's favorable decisions regarding Poland. On 29 January 1919, Dmowski met with the Allies' Supreme War Council for the first time; his five-hour presentation there, delivered in English and French, was described as brilliant. At the meeting, Dmowski stated that he {{had little interest in}} laying claim to areas of Ukraine and Lithuania that were formerly part of Poland, but no longer had a Polish majority. At the same time Dmowski strongly pressed for the return of Polish territories with Polish-speaking majorities taken by Prussia from Poland in 1790s. Dmowski himself admitted that from a purely historical point of view, the Polish claims to Silesia were not entirely strong, but he claimed it for Poland on economic grounds, especially the coal fields. Moreover, Dmowski claimed that German statistics had lied about the number of ethnic Poles living in eastern Germany and that, [...] "these Poles were some of the most educated and highly cultured in the nation, with a strong sense of nationality and men of progressive ideas". In addition, Dmowski, with the strong backing of the French, wanted to send the [...] "Blue Army" [...] to Poland via Danzig, Germany (modern Gdańsk, Poland); it was the intention of both Dmowski and the French that the Blue Army create a territorial fait accompli. This proposal created much opposition from the Germans, the British and the Americans, and finally the Blue Army was sent to Poland in April 1919 via land. Piłsudski was opposed to needlessly annoying the Allies, and {{it has been suggested that}} he did not <b>care</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the Danzig issue.|$|E
50|$|Juzo Takaoka {{was born}} in Tokyo in 1921. His father was a {{traditional}} Japanese bookbinder. Never <b>caring</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> money, his father was always poor, as were most craftspersons in those days. He {{paid little attention to}} his son’s education.|$|R

2500|$|The Randy Ratio did {{not last}} very long, as Tice {{scrapped}} the idea midway through the 2002 season. Randy Moss said [...] "I didn't really <b>care</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the Randy Ratio when it was brought up. I just wanted to win." [...] While Moss caught a career-high 106 passes, {{he also had a}} career low 7 touchdown receptions, and the Vikings struggled to a 6–10 record. Tice suggested after the season that {{it was a mistake to}} inform opponents about his offensive gameplan, but that it was a tool [...] "to motivate [...] and say he was the guy." ...|$|E
2500|$|For a {{brief period}} in 1921 and 1922, the White forces were resurgent in the Russian Far East and {{maintained}} a tenuous control along the coast. This development had its advantages and its disadvantages. As Swenson put it, Kamchatka was [...] "full of Russians who {{had come up with}} the Whites" [...] and they all wanted American clothing and gear. However, [...] "the revolution didn't <b>care</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the importance of the fur traffic and was constantly getting in our way." [...] At one point Swenson's ship was required to evacuate ninety White troops, disarmed at Swenson's insistence, from Okhotsk to Ola. This period also let Swenson get to know several White officers including Colonels Bochkarev [...] and Fielkovsky at Gizhiga. Some of these associations would cause him trouble later.|$|E
2500|$|Opponents of the bill, such as Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY), were {{concerned}} that the measure took a step too far. Meeks said that [...] "I remain committed to doing {{everything in my power}} to support a positive outcome in that nation. But I believe vehemently that unilateral action by the United States is not the answer." [...] Meeks also argued that the bill [...] "does not advance U.S. interests, it will not help the people of Venezuela and it sends the message to our regional allies that we don't <b>care</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> what they think." [...] Regional groups like UNASUR, the Caribbean Community, and the Organization of American States have all supported the government instead of the protestors. Fourteen House members wrote a letter to President Barack Obama about the bill in which they said [...] "as unilateral U.S. intervention and sanctions have caused deep resentment throughout Latin America, these are not the right tools for our regional policy in instances where they lack any significant regional backing." ...|$|E

5000|$|One critic {{suggested}} that a better title would have been Undressed due to Schnall's lack of clothing in the film. Another stated, [...] "No one really <b>cared</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the plot of Undine: It was enough that sylphlike Ida Schnall showed up {{from time to time}} in various stages of near nudity." ...|$|R
50|$|The Polish commanders were {{counting}} on the battle being won by the Polish heavy cavalry, not <b>caring</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> either artillery or infantry. They had not thought that their opponents could change their traditional strategy, or that the Teutonic soldiers besieged in Chojnice could be anything more than spectators. Bernard von Zinnenberg, nonetheless, had planned a totally different kind of battle.|$|R
2500|$|All that Puyi knew of {{the outside}} world was what was told to him by General Yoshioka in daily briefings. When Behr asked Prince Pujie how the news of the Rape of Nanking in December 1937 {{affected}} Puyi, his brother replied: [...] "We didn't hear about it until much later. At the time, it made no real impact." [...] On 4 February 1938, the strongly pro-Japanese and anti-Chinese Joachim von Ribbentrop became the German foreign minister, and under his influence German foreign policy swung in an anti-Chinese and pro-Japanese direction. On 20 February 1938, Adolf Hitler in a speech before the Reichstag announced that Germany was recognizing Manchukuo. Herbert von Dirksen, the out-going German ambassador to Japan, in one of his last acts, visited Puyi in the Salt Tax Palace to tell him that a German embassy would be established in Hsinking later that year, to join the embassies maintained by Japan, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Italy and Nationalist Spain, which the only other countries in the world that had recognized Manchukuo. In 1934, Puyi had been excited when he learned that El Salvador had recognized Manchukuo, which was the first other than Japan to recognize Manchukuo, but by 1938, he did not <b>care</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the news of German recognition of Manchukuo.|$|E
