5|$|Common {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of DVT include pain or tenderness, swelling, warmth, redness or discoloration, and distention of surface veins, although about half of those with the condition have no symptoms. Signs and symptoms alone are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to make a diagnosis, but when considered in conjunction with known risk factors, can help determine the likelihood of DVT. In most suspected cases, DVT is ruled out after evaluation, and symptoms are more often due to other causes, such as <b>cellulitis,</b> Baker's cyst, musculoskeletal injury, or lymphedema. Other differential diagnoses include hematoma, tumors, venous or arterial aneurysms, and connective tissue disorders.|$|E
5|$|In June the {{battalion}} {{was placed in}} reserve as a ready-reinforcement unit and consequently saw little combat. From July to September, 3rd Battalion operated all throughout the I Corps area of operations, moving its command post to ten different locations. Hundreds of Marines were also affected by <b>cellulitis.</b> Following President Johnson's halt of the US bombing campaign on 1 November, 3rd Battalion Marines had to watch as the PAVN brazenly pushed large convoys of men and munitions south along the Ben Hai River. In one instance it took three days for {{the battalion}} to get approval for a single airstrike on a North Vietnamese convoy.|$|E
5|$|S. iniae {{can cause}} {{opportunistic}} infections in weakened or immunocompromised humans. It is most {{commonly associated with}} bacteremic <b>cellulitis,</b> but {{has been known to}} cause endocarditis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis. The first recognized cases of human infection occurred in Texas in 1991 and in Ottawa in 1994, but the sources of infection were not determined. Human infection with S.iniae was also identified in Toronto between 15 and 20 December 1995, when three Asian patients were admitted to a hospital with <b>cellulitis</b> of the hand after injuring themselves while handling raw fish. All three were found to have bacteremia, initially attributed to Streptococcus uberis, but later correctly identified as S.iniae. In February 1996, a Chinese man was admitted to the same hospital with sepsis one week after preparing a fresh whole tilapia, and was also diagnosed with S.iniae bacteremia. A subsequent epidemiological investigation found other cases in the Toronto area, for a total of nine patients; all were of Asian descent and all had handled raw fish (mostly tilapia) before developing infection. Other cases were later identified in the United States and elsewhere in Canada, and have since been reported in Asia (Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore). Asian descent is a common trend in the majority of invasive human cases, but it is unknown whether this is due to inherent differences in immunity or because of cultural differences in the fish preparation which lend themselves to a higher incidence of infection.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{symptom of}} prepatellar {{bursitis}} is the {{swelling of the}} area around the kneecap. It generally does not produce a significant amount of pain unless pressure is applied directly to the swelling. The area of swelling may be red (erythema), warm to the touch, or surrounded by <b>cellulitis,</b> particularly if the area has become infected. In such cases, the bursitis is often accompanied by fever. Unlike arthritis, prepatellar bursitis generally does not affect the range of motion of the knee, though it may cause some discomfort when the knee is completely flexed. Flexion and extension of the knee may cause crepitus.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are used}} recreationally and by {{problematic}} drug misusers. Mortality is higher among poly-drug misusers that also use benzodiazepines. Heavy alcohol use also increases mortality among poly-drug users. Dependence and tolerance, often coupled with dosage escalation, to benzodiazepines can develop rapidly among drug misusers; withdrawal syndrome may appear after {{as little as}} three weeks of continuous use. Long-term use {{has the potential to}} cause both physical and psychological dependence and severe withdrawal symptoms such as depression, anxiety (often to the point of panic attacks), and agoraphobia. Benzodiazepines and, in particular, temazepam are sometimes used intravenously, which, if done incorrectly or in an unsterile manner, can lead to medical complications including abscesses, <b>cellulitis,</b> thrombophlebitis, arterial puncture, deep vein thrombosis, and gangrene. Sharing syringes and needles for this purpose also brings up the possibility of transmission of hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases. Benzodiazepines are also misused intranasally, which may have additional health consequences. Once benzodiazepine dependence has been established, a clinician usually converts the patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam before beginning a gradual reduction program.|$|E
25|$|Other {{conditions}} {{that can cause}} similar symptoms include: <b>cellulitis,</b> a sebaceous cyst and necrotising fasciitis. <b>Cellulitis</b> typically also has an erythematous reaction, but does not confer any purulent drainage.|$|E
25|$|Around 95% {{of people}} are better after seven to ten days of treatment. Potential {{complications}} include abscess formation. <b>Cellulitis</b> occurred in about 21.2 million people in 2015. In the United States about two of every 1000 people per year have a case affected the lower leg. <b>Cellulitis</b> in 2015 resulted in about 16,900 deaths worldwide. In the United Kingdom, <b>cellulitis</b> {{was the reason for}} 1.6% of admissions to a hospital.|$|E
25|$|About 80% {{of cases}} of Ludwig's angina, or <b>cellulitis</b> of the submandibular space, are caused by dental infections. Mixed infections, due to both aerobes and anaerobes, are {{commonly}} associated {{with this type of}} <b>cellulitis.</b> Typically, this includes alpha-hemolytic streptococci, staphylococci, and bacteroides groups.|$|E
25|$|Non-invasive disease manifestations include {{predominantly}} tonsillitis and superficial skin infections. Additionally, it {{has long}} been recognized as a potential cause of cellulitis/erysipelas. However, the role of SDSE in <b>cellulitis</b> might have been previously underestimated, and it was linked to a majority of the <b>cellulitis</b> cases in a recent study.|$|E
25|$|Cutaneous lesions {{can become}} superinfected with bacteria, {{resulting}} in <b>cellulitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Cellulitis</b> is {{also seen}} in staphylococcal and corynebacterial mixed infections in bulls.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cellulitis</b> in 2015 {{resulted}} in about 16,900 deaths worldwide, up from 12,600 in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Some oysters also harbor {{bacterial}} species {{which can}} cause human disease; of importance is Vibrio vulnificus, which causes gastroenteritis, which is usually self-limiting, and <b>cellulitis.</b> <b>Cellulitis</b> can be so severe and rapidly spreading, often it requires amputation. It is usually acquired when {{the contents of the}} oyster come in contact with a cut skin lesion, as when shucking an oyster.|$|E
25|$|The {{elderly and}} those with a {{weakened}} immune system are especially vulnerable to contracting <b>cellulitis.</b> Diabetics {{are more susceptible to}} <b>cellulitis</b> than the general population because of impairment of the immune system; they are especially prone to <b>cellulitis</b> in the feet, because the disease causes impairment of blood circulation in the legs, leading to diabetic foot or foot ulcers. Poor control of blood glucose levels allows bacteria to grow more rapidly in the affected tissue, and facilitates rapid progression if the infection enters the bloodstream. Neural degeneration in diabetes means these ulcers may not be painful, thus often become infected. Those who have suffered poliomyelitis are also prone because of circulatory problems, especially in the legs.|$|E
25|$|Reduces {{the risk}} of causing an {{infected}} surgical site with delayed healing (e.g. osteomyelitis or <b>cellulitis).</b>|$|E
25|$|Moxifloxacin is used {{to treat}} a number of infections, including: {{respiratory}} tract infections, <b>cellulitis,</b> anthrax, intraabdominal infections, endocarditis, meningitis, and tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|Without {{treatment}} people typically {{get better}} within three weeks. Complications may include <b>cellulitis</b> or poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Rheumatic fever {{does not appear}} to be related.|$|E
25|$|Diseases {{that affect}} blood {{circulation}} {{in the legs}} and feet, such as chronic venous insufficiency and varicose veins, are also risk factors for <b>cellulitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Cellulitis</b> is {{also common}} among dense populations sharing hygiene {{facilities}} and common living quarters, such as military installations, college dormitories, nursing homes, oil platforms, and homeless shelters.|$|E
25|$|Recognizing {{the primary}} source of {{infection}} (i.e., facial <b>cellulitis,</b> middle ear, and sinus infections) and treating {{the primary source}} expeditiously {{is the best way to}} prevent cavernous sinus thrombosis.|$|E
25|$|In {{those who}} have {{previously}} had <b>cellulitis,</b> the use of antibiotics may help prevent future episodes. This is recommended by CREST for {{those who have}} had more than two episodes.|$|E
25|$|Skin {{infections are}} {{the most common form of}} S. aureus infection. This can {{manifest}} in various ways, including small benign boils, folliculitis, impetigo, <b>cellulitis,</b> and more severe, invasive soft-tissue infections.|$|E
25|$|Juvenile <b>cellulitis,</b> {{also known}} as puppy strangles, is a disease that affects puppies. Its cause is unknown, but {{it is likely to}} have a {{hereditary}} component related to the immune system.|$|E
25|$|The typical {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of <b>cellulitis</b> is an area which is red, hot, and painful. The photos shown here of are of mild to moderate cases, and are not representative of earlier stages of the condition.|$|E
25|$|Antibiotics choices {{depend on}} {{regional}} availability, but a penicillinase-resistant semisynthetic penicillin or a first-generation cephalosporin is currently recommended for <b>cellulitis</b> without abscess. A course of antibiotics is not effective in between 6 and 37% of cases.|$|E
25|$|Levofloxacin is used {{to treat}} infections including: {{respiratory}} tract infections, <b>cellulitis,</b> urinary tract infections, prostatitis, anthrax, endocarditis, meningitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, traveler's diarrhea, tuberculosis, and plague and is available by mouth, intravenously, and in eye drop form.|$|E
25|$|When the lymphatic {{impairment}} {{becomes so}} great that the lymph fluid exceeds the lymphatic system's ability to transport it, an abnormal amount of protein-rich fluid collects in the tissues. Left untreated, this stagnant, protein-rich fluid causes tissue channels to increase in size and number, reducing oxygen availability. This interferes with wound healing and provides a rich culture medium for bacterial growth that can result in infections: <b>cellulitis,</b> lymphangitis, lymphadenitis and in severe cases, skin ulcers. It is vital for lymphedema patients {{to be aware of the}} symptoms of infection and to seek immediate treatment, since recurrent infections or <b>cellulitis,</b> in addition to their inherent danger, further damage the lymphatic system and set up a vicious circle.|$|E
25|$|Cefalexin {{can treat}} {{a number of}} {{bacterial}} infections including: otitis media, streptococcal pharyngitis, bone and joint infections, pneumonia, <b>cellulitis,</b> and urinary tract infections. It {{may be used to}} prevent bacterial endocarditis. It can also be used for the prevention of recurrent urinary-tract infections.|$|E
25|$|Contrary {{to common}} belief, Flucloxacillin has good {{activity}} against non-β-lactamase-producing bacteria including Streptococcus pyogenes. Due to this widespread belief, empirical therapy for significant <b>cellulitis</b> often involves dual-therapy to cover both staphylococci and streptococci, however {{this has not}} shown to be of clinical benefit.|$|E
25|$|These lasers {{are also}} used {{extensively}} {{in the field of}} cosmetic medicine for laser hair removal and the treatment of minor vascular defects such as spider veins on the face and legs. Recently used for Dissecting <b>cellulitis</b> of the scalp, a rare skin disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{legs and}} face {{are the most}} common sites involved, though <b>cellulitis</b> can occur on any part of the body. The leg is {{typically}} affected following a break in the skin. Other risk factors include obesity, leg swelling, and old age. For facial infections, a break in the skin beforehand is not usually the case. The bacteria most commonly involved are streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. In contrast to <b>cellulitis,</b> erysipelas is a bacterial infection involving the more superficial layers of the skin, present with an area of redness with well-defined edges, and more often is associated with a fever. Diagnosis is usually based on the presenting signs and symptoms, while cell culture is rarely possible. Before making a diagnosis, more serious infections such as an underlying bone infection or necrotizing fasciitis should be ruled out.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{bacterial}} infection of skin lesions, manifesting as impetigo, <b>cellulitis,</b> and erysipelas, {{is the most}} common complication in healthy children. Disseminated primary varicella infection usually seen in the immunocompromised may have high morbidity. Ninety percent of cases of varicella pneumonia occur in the adult population. Rarer complications of disseminated chickenpox include myocarditis, hepatitis, and glomerulonephritis.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of pericoronitis is inflammation {{in the soft}} tissues surrounding the crown of a tooth. This encompasses {{a wide spectrum of}} severity, making no distinction to the extent of the inflammation into adjacent tissues or whether there is associated active infection (pericoronal infection caused by micro-organisms sometimes leading to a pus filled pericoronal abscess or <b>cellulitis).</b>|$|E
25|$|Horses may acquire <b>cellulitis,</b> usually {{secondarily}} to a wound (which can {{be extremely}} small and superficial) or to a deep-tissue infection, such as an abscess or infected bone, tendon sheath, or joint. <b>Cellulitis</b> from a superficial wound usually creates less lameness (grade 1–2 of 5) than that caused by septic arthritis (grade 4–5). The horse exhibits inflammatory edema, which is hot, painful swelling. This swelling differs from stocking up in that the horse does not display symmetrical swelling in two or four legs, but in only one leg. This swelling begins near the source of infection, but eventually continues down the leg. In some cases, the swelling also travels distally. Treatment includes cleaning the wound and caring for it properly, the administration of NSAIDs, such as phenylbutazone, cold hosing, applying a sweat wrap or a poultice, and mild exercise. Veterinarians may also prescribe antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|Four {{adverse events}} {{associated}} with moxibustion were bruising, burns and <b>cellulitis,</b> spinal epidural abscess, and large superficial basal cell carcinoma. Ten adverse events {{were associated with}} cupping. The minor ones were keloid scarring, burns, and bullae; the serious ones were acquired hemophilia A, stroke following cupping {{on the back and}} neck, factitious panniculitis, reversible cardiac hypertrophy, and iron deficiency anemia.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of the skin assists a doctor in determining a diagnosis. A doctor may also suggest blood tests, a wound culture, or other tests to help rule out a blood clot deep in the veins of the legs. <b>Cellulitis</b> in the lower leg is characterized by signs and symptoms {{similar to those of}} a deep vein thrombosis, such as warmth, pain, and swelling (inflammation).|$|E
