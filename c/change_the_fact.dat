5|$|Blaine had briefly {{joined the}} Cheerios {{when it looked}} like New Directions would be {{disbanding}} after their Sectionals loss, and cheerleading coach Sue (Jane Lynch) blackmails Blaine into rejoining; Blaine and Sam hatch up a plan to bring Sue down from the inside. Blaine eventually confesses to Sam that he has feelings for him, to which Sam assures him that he is somewhat flattered by Blaine's honesty and attraction, and that it would not <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Blaine is still Sam's best friend. Blaine still loves Kurt and asks Burt for his permission to propose to Kurt, but Burt tells him they're too young to marry, and advises him to wait. Blaine remains determined, however, and while shopping for a ring, he meets Jan (Patty Duke), a lesbian jeweler who has been with her partner Liz (Meredith Baxter) for over thirty years. Jan offers to be a mentor to him, and Blaine and Kurt later have dinner with Jan and Liz, where Jan and Liz explain how their relationship evolved over the years and their experience with the growing mainstream acceptance of gay people. New Directions wins at Regionals, and Will and Emma get married immediately afterward, with the glee club, plus some graduates including Kurt, in attendance. Blaine is shown, after the ceremony is over, holding a jewelry box behind his back.|$|E

In choosing to do a piece in the form of popular music, Beuys demonstrated a commitment to his views and the most expansive ways of having them reach people. While it is easy to resist and ridicule Beuys' efforts in the pop arena, it does not <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that this {{is an important part of}} his collected works that needs to be acknowledged to better understand his scope, intention and own views of art.|$|E
25|$|She {{initially}} wrote a work on artistic training, Le dessin sans maître (1850), which {{explained the}} Cavé Method, {{which she said}} she had used since 1847. It aimed to exercise visual memory, a basic aptitude necessary for drawing. Delacroix wrote a favourable review in the Revue des deux Mondes of September 1850. A commission examined the method in 1850 and decided in favour of it and Lecoq's method (inspired by the same concept). The Minister of Public Education trialled Cavé's method in normal primary schools in Caen and Douai in 1862 and later the same year in those in Chartres. The results were judged to be satisfactory enough to recommend adopting the method in other normal schools. The assessors' arguments in favour of drawing training did not <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that they saw it as a pastime rather than an industrial skill - it is still impossible to say how far these methods were applied, if not by their inventors.|$|E

But members indicated these assertions were irrelevant. Kastenmeier noted the allegations did not <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> — that Claiborne {{was found by}} a Nevada jury to have filed false income tax returns in 1979 and 1980.|$|R
25|$|Berlusconi was {{expected}} to start serving his four-year prison sentence (reduced to one year), either under house arrest or doing unpaid social community service, in mid-October 2013. In mid-October he informed the court that he preferred to serve the sentence by doing community service. Because of bureaucracy in the legal court system, it was however expected his one-year-long full-time community service would only start in around April 2014. On 19 October, the Milan appeal court ruled that Berlusconi's public office ban should be reduced from five to two years; which was later also confirmed by the Court of Cassation. The court imposed this public office ban, however this did not <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Berlusconi according to the Severino law received a ban preventing him from running as a candidate in legislative elections for a prolonged six-year period, which effectively superseded the shorter court imposed public office ban. Berlusconi began his community service at a Catholic care home centre on 9 May 2014, where he is required to work four hours {{a week for a}} year with elderly dementia patients.|$|E
500|$|Knight {{argues that}} the human {{population}} is far greater than the Earth can handle, and {{that the best thing}} for Earth's biosphere is for humans to voluntarily cease reproducing. He says that humans are [...] "incompatible with the biosphere" [...] and that human existence is causing environmental damage which will eventually bring about the extinction of humans (as well as other organisms). According to Knight, the vast majority of human societies have not lived sustainable lifestyles, and attempts to live environmentally friendly lifestyles do not <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that human existence has ultimately been destructive to the Earth and many of its non-human organisms. Voluntary human extinction is promoted {{on the grounds that it}} will prevent human suffering and the extinction of other species; Knight points out that many species are threatened by the increasing human population.|$|E

Castiel saves Dean from a demon and tries and fails to {{convince}} him to back off. Later, after Lisa is mortally wounded by a demon possessing her in an attempt to force Dean not to exorcise her, Castiel arrives at the hospital and without being asked, heals her wounds and at Dean's request, erases all of her and her son Ben's memories of Dean. He does this as a final act of friendship towards Dean though both admit it doesn't <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that they are now enemies.

500|$|The {{central theme}} of the movie is {{discussed}} in the film's fourth scene. Witwer discusses the PreCrime system with the division's staff. He believes that its main [...] "legalistic drawback" [...] is that it [...] "arrests individuals who have broken no laws." [...] Jad responds, [...] "But they will!" [...] When Anderton later arrives upon this discussion, he acknowledges the paradox Witwer raises; that the precogs' prevent an event accepted as fact, but one which will never happen. To show him that people regularly use predetermination, Anderton picks up a wooden ball and rolls it toward Witwer, who catches it before it lands on the ground. When asked why he caught the ball, Witwer says [...] "Because {{it was going to}} fall." [...] Anderton replies, [...] "But it didn't." [...] Then confidently tells him, [...] "The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that it was going to}} happen." [...] Kowalski feels this example is faulty in the sense that the ball has no free will; it merely acts according to the laws of physics, but he acknowledges that if an individual were to have freely chosen to commit murder, then it would hold. Film scholar Stephen Mulhall points out that unlike the laws of physics which have a series of scientifically testable causal laws, Anderton merely has the visions of the precogs', whose psychic abilities are not fully explained by science.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} criticized for its {{graphics}} and engine, which reviewers considered to be outdated. G4 called the engine [...] "old" [...] and [...] "clunky", and PC Format said that [...] "the whole thing {{is limited by the}} creaking engine." [...] However, certain sources praised the engine. Game Informer called it [...] "the best role-playing engine that has ever been invented," [...] and GameSpot said that [...] "'immortal' may be a better word to describe the engine, because the fact is, Icewind Dale II plays great." [...] In regards to the graphics, GameSpot said that [...] "in many ways Icewind Dale II represents the best use of the Infinity Engine's prerendered, isometric settings to date, [...] that doesn't <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Icewind Dale II generally looks dated." [...] IGN thought the sprites had become out-dated, and that [...] "the animations are crude by today's standards." [...] New Straits Times agreed, saying that although some of the effects were attractive, the [...] "dated Infinity engine" [...] could not compare to contemporaries Dungeon Siege and Neverwinter Nights. However, Computer Gaming World believed that [...] "it consistently offers the same striking and imaginative environments that establish the tone and immersive charm of the game," [...] and Computer Games Magazine said, [...] "it may not look like much, but it's got it where it counts." [...] The game's pre-rendered backgrounds received praise. IGN said that [...] "the artwork is attractive, both conceptually and in its final form," [...] and Game Informer called them [...] "beautiful". Many reviewers complained about the game's pathfinding AI, which PC Zone called [...] "outrageously bad." ...|$|E

2500|$|Longfellow's poem is not {{historically}} accurate, but the inaccuracies were deliberate.

[...] The poem {{was one of}} a series in which he sought to create American legends; earlier examples include The Song of Hiawatha (1855) and The Courtship of Miles Standish (1858).

The date of the Elephantine stela in Year 2 II Shemu day 10 of Setnakhte's reign—the date of which is mentioned only halfway in the stela rather than at its start—is immediately followed by this proclamation: [...] "There were no opponents against His Majesty, l.p.h., in all the lands." ...|$|E

2500|$|In law, deceit {{and fraud}} both fall within tort {{and are also}} often crimes, while {{fraudulent}} misrepresentation is usually associated with contract law. In a claim for deceit or fraud, damages are intended to put the claimant in the position as if the tort had not been committed. [...] Therefore, a claim for damages from any of these, requires that the statement was reasonably relied on, and that this reliance led to loss or harm. The motive for dishonesty is irrelevant, so a 'good' motive (e.g. defrauding a bank to help starving children) does not <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of deceit or fraud. [...] Just because a belief is unreasonable does not mean a statement is fraudulent, {{but it could be}} evidence of dishonesty.|$|E

[...] Edge also gave 7/10, stating [...] "Max Payne 3 might solve the problem of how you manage to reload when carrying more than one gun, but detailing alone can't <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that this is a surprisingly conservative game from Rockstar".|$|E

Popper dedicated his Conjectures and Refutations to Hayek. For his part, Hayek dedicated a collection of papers, Studies in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics, to Popper and, in 1982, said that [...] "ever since his Logik der Forschung first came out in 1934, I have been a complete adherent to his general theory of methodology".
