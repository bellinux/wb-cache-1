40|$|Purpose – To {{examine whether}} the {{properties}} of the combined-ratio series, an indicator of underwriting profitability in property-liability insurance, have changed over time. Design/methodology/approach – Using the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF), we check whether <b>combined</b> <b>ratios</b> are stationary. Findings – Underwriting profit has worsened in recent years, and <b>combined</b> <b>ratios</b> are non-stationary. This characteristic of <b>combined</b> <b>ratios</b> needs further analysis for its impact on underwriting cycles. Practical implications – Traditional concepts of underwriting cycles, such as predictable cycle lengths and trends, may have changed. Originality/value – The possibility of a non-stationary combined-ratio series is recognized, and the possible existence of non-stationarity and breaks in <b>combined</b> <b>ratios</b> is introduced.

40|$|Soluble oligovalent antigen [...] {{antibody}} complexes {{were prepared}} and analysed by ultracentrifugation {{in order to}} study {{the effect of the}} <b>combining</b> <b>ratio,</b> antigen valence and concentration upon the size and molecular composition of the composition of the complexes. Fluorescein (F) conjugates of rabbit serum albumin (RSA) and thyroglobulin (RTg) were combined with high affinity rabbit anti-F antibodies to form soluble complexes. The effect of the <b>combining</b> <b>ratio</b> paralleled findings in precipitating systems in that the largest soluble complexes were found at equimolarity and mild molar antibody excess. Tetravalent antigen formed precipitates at <b>combining</b> <b>ratios</b> near equimolarity, whereas trivalent antigens failed to precipitate at similar concentrations. Complexes prepared near equimolarity were most sensitive to changes in concentration, higher concentrations leading to larger complexes. The Ab/Ag ratios of different-size complexes in the same preparation were remarkably similar. This ratio was dependent on the antibody [...] antigen <b>combining</b> <b>ratio,</b> was limited by antigen valence and was not affected by concentration differences. The data support the hypothesis that soluble complexes are formed in two steps.

40|$|The Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) Code {{decoding}} algorithm {{make use}} of a scaled receive signal derived from maximizing the log-likelihood ratio of the received signal. The scaling factor (often called the <b>combining</b> <b>ratio)</b> in an AWGN channel is a ratio between signal amplitude and noise variance. Accurately estimating this ratio has shown as much as 0. 6 dB decoding performance gain. This presentation briefly describes three methods for estimating the combining ratio: a Pilot-Guided estimation method, a Blind estimation method, and a Simulation-Based Look-Up table. The Pilot Guided Estimation method {{has shown that the}} maximum likelihood estimates of signal amplitude is the mean inner product of the received sequence and the known sequence, the attached synchronization marker (ASM), and signal variance is the difference of the mean of the squared received sequence and the square of the signal amplitude. This method has the advantage of simplicity at the expense of latency since several frames worth of ASMs. The Blind estimation method s maximum likelihood estimator is the average of the product of the received signal with the hyperbolic tangent of the product <b>combining</b> <b>ratio</b> and the received signal. The root of this equation can be determined by an iterative binary search between 0 and 1 after normalizing the received sequence. This method has the benefit of requiring one frame of data to estimate the <b>combining</b> <b>ratio</b> which is good for faster changing channels compared to the previous method, however it is computationally expensive. The final method uses a look-up table based on prior simulated results to determine signal amplitude and noise variance. In this method the received mean signal strength is controlled to a constant soft decision value. The magnitude of the deviation is averaged over a predetermined number of samples. This value is referenced in a look up table to determine the <b>combining</b> <b>ratio</b> that prior simulation associated with the average magnitude of the deviation. This method is more complicated than the Pilot-Guided Method due to the gain control circuitry, but does not have the real-time computation complexity of the Blind Estimation method. Each of these methods can be used to provide an accurate estimation of the <b>combining</b> <b>ratio,</b> and the final selection of the estimation method depends on other design constraints...|$|R

The bounds offer simple-to-evaluate explicit expressions, and are typically within 0. 6 dB for hybrid systems with diversity order {{up to eight}} that use at least two branches, yet are independent of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Contrary to conclusions conjectured in a recently published paper, it is proved that the SNR penalty is not a constant, independent of SNR. It is also shown that previous estimates of the performance losses of selection diversity relative to MRC underestimate or lower bound the losses for MPSK modulation systems, and that the true loss can be significantly larger than previously believed. An upper bound to this loss is also obtained.
