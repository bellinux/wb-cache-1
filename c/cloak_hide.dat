40|$|An invisibility cloak {{has been}} designed, {{realized}} and characterized. The <b>cloak</b> <b>hides</b> free-standing sub-wavelength three-dimensional objects at the short wavelength {{edge of the}} visible spectrum. By a bottom-up approach the cloak was self-assembled around the object. Such fabrication approach constitutes a further important step towards real world applications of cloaking; leaving the realm of curiosity. The cloak {{and the way it}} was fabricated opens an avenue for many spectacular nanooptical applications such as non-disturbing sensors and photo-detectors, highly efficient solar cells, or optical nanoantenna arrays with strongly suppressed cross-talk to mention only a few.

40|$|Carpet or ground-plane invisibility <b>cloaks</b> <b>hide</b> {{an object}} in {{reflection}} and inhibit transmission by construction. This concept has significantly reduced the otherwise demanding material requirements and has hence enabled various experimental demonstrations. In contrast, free-space invisibility cloaks should work in both reflection and transmission. The fabrication of omnidirectional three-dimensional free-space cloaks still poses significant challenges. Recently, {{the idea of the}} carpet cloak has been carried over to experiments on unidirectional free-space invisibility cloaks that only work perfectly for one particular viewing direction and, depending on the design, also for one linear polarization of light only. Here, by using photorealistic ray tracing, we visualize the performance of four types of such unidirectional cloaks in three dimensions for different viewing directions and different polarizations of light, revealing virtues and limitations of these approaches in an intuitive manner.

She put a real one in its place, and never knew that her own fresh, happy face was as lovely; for the thought of the two mothers made comfortable by her was better than all the pearls and diamonds that fell from the lips of the good girl in the fairy tale.|$|R

Nevar was once a normal human, no more than an upstart baron with a band of brigands as his followers, and considered no more than an irritation on Alaunus. However, he became twisted and corrupt when he stole the Enchanted Oak and used it to create a Staff of Power for himself; as a result, each time he uses his staff for evil, half of his remaining life-force is taken away, taking its toll on his mind and his body.

Numerical results including target objects with different shapes are given to verify correctness and effectiveness of the proposed cloak...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} it is {{possible}} to design an invisible wavelength-sized metal-dielectric metamaterial object without evoking cloaking. Our approach is an extension of the neutral inclusion concept by Zhou and Hu [Phys. Rev. E 74, 026607 (2006) ] to Mie scatterers. We demonstrate that an increase of metal fraction in the metamaterial leads to a transition from dielectric-like to metal-like scattering, which proceeds through invisibility or optical neutrality of the scatterer. Formally this is due to cancellation of multiple scattering orders, similarly to plasmonic cloaking introduced by Alu and Engheta [Phys. Rev. E 72, 016623 (2005) ], but without introduction of the separation of the scatterer into <b>cloak</b> and <b>hidden</b> regions. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

Both schemes as initially presented neglected the inevitable dispersion that arises when a designed medium replaces vacuum under trans- formation. Here we define a transformation design protocol that incorporates both spacetime transformations and dispersive material responses in a natural and rigorous way. We show how this methodology is applied to an event cloak designed to appear as a homogeneous and isotropic but dispersive medium. The consequences for spacetime transformation de- sign in dispersive materials are discussed, and some parameter and bandwidth constraints identified...|$|R

40|$|Cloaking {{has long}} been {{exploited}} by spammers {{for the purpose of}} increasing the exposure of their websites. In other words, cloaking has long served as a major malicious technique in search engine optimization (SEO). <b>Cloaking</b> <b>hides</b> the true nature of a website by delivering blatantly different content to users versus web crawlers. Recently, we have also witnessed a rising trend of employing cloaking in search engine marketing (SEM). However, detecting cloaking is challenging. Existing approaches cannot detect IP cloaking and are not suitable for detecting cloaking in SEM because their search-and-visit method leads to click fraud. In addition, they focus on detecting and measuring cloaking on the server side, but the results are not visible to users to help them avoid frauds. Our work focuses on mitigating IP cloaking and SEM cloaking, and providing client-based real-time cloaking detection services. To achieve these goals, we first propose the Simhash-based Website Model (SWM), a condensed representation of websites, which can model natural page dynamics. Based on SWM, we design and implement Cloaker Catcher, an accurate, efficient and privacy-preserving system, that consists of a server that crawls websites visited by users on demand and a client-side extension that fetches spider views of websites from the server and compares them with user views to detect cloaking. Since Cloaker Catcher checks on the client side for each real user, IP cloaking can be detected whenever it occurs and click fraud in SEM can also be prevented. Using our system, we conducted the first analysis of SEM cloaking and found that the main purpose of SEM cloakers is to provide illicit services...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This article explores Robert Louis Stevenson's use of costume as {{a device}} for {{exploring}} Scotland's fetishization of it's literary and cultural history. In Stevenson's The Master of Ballantrae, the mythologizing of James Durie as the eponymous Master depends upon {{a series of}} dramatic costume changes. Durie confounds attempts to consign him to the grave and to history by returning, time and again, in new guises. Staging his own cult of personality, the Master transforms himself from a Jacobite with a "white cockade in his hat," into a pirate, a smuggler dressed in "a sea-cloak," a diamond- and-lace adorned French fop, a Nabob and finally into an emigrant Scottish New Yorker seeking a fortune in the Forests and mountains of North-America. The Master's refusal to die, consumption of the family fortune, and final live burial also configure him as a vampire. All of these appearances ironically address Romantic stereotypes of Scottishness. Clichés abound and are ironically treated by Stevenson. But under the costumes lie the less glamorous problems faced by the nation: bankruptcy, violent cultural division, mass emigration and separation from the land. This essay compares James, Master of Ballantrae, with Walter Scott's earlier Edgar Master of Ravenswood in The Bride of Lammermoor (1819) : Edgar Ravenswood has only one set of clothes: a cloak that perpetually wraps about him and a hat with a black feather. Ravenswood's <b>cloak</b> <b>hides</b> a starving body. Living {{on the edge of}} a cliff, he is going nowhere. Read comparatively, dressing up in both novels ultimately draws attention not to Scotland's glamorous love affair with itself, but to what is concealed and why there's such a reluctance for it to be seen...|$|R
