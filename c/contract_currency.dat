40|$|Abstract. In the {{background}} where the domestic enterprises commonly have a weak protection consciousness against {{the exchange rate}} risk, this article makes a deep analysis based on the definition of exchange rate risk and its cause. By comparison of the traditional management method of exchange rate risk with another one based on financial engineering tools, it also deeply analyzes the method to use the financial engineering technology {{in the management of}} exchange rate risk, and concludes the primary purpose of exchange rate risk management is for hedging. This article proposes an optimal analysis method in two aspects, namely the minimum risk and maximum efficiency, for the forward-based optimal hedging, and proposes an optimal analysis method of dynamic hedging for the optimal hedging of option-based tools. Based on the description of the application of financial tools in foreign exchange futures, forward <b>contract,</b> <b>currency</b> exchange and foreign exchange option, it makes an empirical analysis on the management of foreign exchange risk by taking an assumed T company as the carrier and based on the trading tools of forward foreign exchange and currency option, which describes the operation procedure of financial tools in a more direct way and proves the efficiency of the optimal analysis method of this article...|$|E

Activity data show that while the majority of conditions incur below average cost, the mean cost is influenced by a small number of autosomal dominant and X linked disorders. The cost risk to the provider for seeing families over an extended period is minimal, as the data establish that family files experience an exponential decrease in activation probability over the early years, but this becomes constant later on.

40|$|Background Over {{the past}} decade {{commissioning}} of primary care dentistry has seen <b>contract</b> <b>currency</b> evolving from payment for units of dental activity towards blended contracts that include key performance indicators such as access, quality and improved health outcome. Objectives The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate a blended/incentive-driven model of dental service provision. To: 1. 	Explore stakeholder perspectives of the new service delivery model 2. 	Assess the effectiveness of the new service delivery model in reducing the risk of and amount of dental disease and enhancing oral health related quality of life in patients 3. 	Assess cost effectiveness of the new service delivery model Methods Using a mixed methods approach the study included three dental practices working under the blended/incentive-driven (INCENTIVE) contract and three working under the units of dental activity (TRADITONAL) contract. All were based in West Yorkshire. The qualitative study reports on the meaning of key aspects of the model for three stakeholder groups (lay people (patients and individuals without a dentist), commissioners and the primary care dental teams), with framework analysis of focus group and semi-structured interview data. A non-randomised study compared effectiveness and cost effectiveness of treatment under the two contracts. The primary outcome was gingivitis measured using bleeding on probing. Secondary outcomes included oral health related quality of life and cost effectiveness. Results Participants in the qualitative study associated the INCENTIVE contract with more access, greater use of skill mix and improved health outcomes. In the quantitative analyses, of 550 participants recruited, 291 attended baseline and follow up. Given missing data and following quality assurance, 188 were included in the bleeding on probing analysis, 187 in the caries assessment and 210 in the economic analysis. The results were mixed. The primary outcome favoured the INCENTIVE practices whilst the assessment of caries favoured the TRADITIONAL practices. INCENTIVE practices attracted a higher cost for the service commissioner but were financially attractive for the dental provider at the practice level. Differences in generic health related quality of life were negligible. Positive changes over time in oral health related quality of life in both groups were statistically significant. Limitations The results of the quantitative analysis should be treated with caution given small sample numbers, reservations about the validity of pooling, differential drop out results and data quality issues. Conclusions A large proportion of people in this study who had access to a dentist did not follow up on oral care. These individuals are more likely to be younger males and have poorer oral health. Whilst access to dental services was increased this did not appear to facilitate continued use of services. Future Work Further research is required to understand how best to promote and encourage appropriate dental service attendance especially amongst those with high level of need to avoid increasing health inequalities; and to assess the financial impact of the contract. For dental practitioners, there are challenges around perceptions about preventive dentistry and use of the risk assessments and care pathways. Changes in skill mix pose further challenges...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{examines}} the volatility {{dynamics of the}} financial futures returns. Samuelson (1965) demonstrated theoretically that the conditional variance of changes in futures prices should increase as the time-to-maturity decreases. Interestingly, the empirical evidence on the Samuelson hypothesis is mixed. This essay revisits that issue, applying a unified GARCH framework to a unique data set of daily data, spanning 19 years up to 2000, and eleven types of financial <b>contracts</b> (<b>currencies,</b> S&P 500, Nikkei 225, Eurodollar, Treasury Bills). The conditional variance equation is augmented by time-to-maturity, open interest and trading volume variables. I detect evidence for a role of the time-to-maturity in currency futures, and mixed evidence in equity index and interest rate futures. Lagged trading volume and open interest are positively related to volatility {{in most of these}} financial futures but they do not fully account for the estimated conditional variance...|$|R

A {{key question is}} whether such wide spreads were excessive or explained by models of bid-ask spreads. Precrisis estimates of standard models show that spreads during the crisis were in most cases tighter than spreads predicted by the models and there are few cases of excessive spreads. The result is largely explained by the substantial increase in exchange rate volatility during the crisis {{and to some extent}} by the level change.
