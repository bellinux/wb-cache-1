The absence of the censorship provisions also opened Britain up as a market for internationally printed books, which were similarly <b>cheaper</b> than those British printers could produce.|$|E

5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids {{and their}} closer neighbours mostly {{cost less than}} silver; only polonium and astatine are more expensive than gold, on account of their significant radioactivity. As of 5 April 2014, prices for small samples (up to 100 g) of silicon, antimony and tellurium, and graphite, aluminium and selenium, average around one third the cost of silver (US$1.5 per gram or about $45 an ounce). Boron, germanium and arsenic samples average about three-and-a-half times the cost of silver. Polonium is available for about $100 per microgram. Zalutsky and Pruszynski estimate a similar cost for producing astatine. Prices for the applicable elements traded as commodities tend to range from {{two to three times}} <b>cheaper</b> than the sample price (Ge), to nearly three thousand times <b>cheaper</b> (As).|$|E
