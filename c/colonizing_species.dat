50|$|Because {{confidence}} in expected outcomes is often {{greater in the}} short-term (e.g., 20 years) than the long-term future, {{it may be more}} reasonable to use short-term projections to guide actions. However, {{it is also important to}} consider whether the climate will remain suitable long enough for <b>colonizing</b> <b>species</b> to mature and reproduce, if that is the management goal.|$|E
50|$|The {{distance}} and remoteness of the Hawaiian archipelago is a biological filter. Seeds or spores {{attached to a}} lost migrating bird's feather or an insect {{falling out of the}} high winds found a place to survive in the islands and whatever else was needed to reproduce. The narrowing of the gene pool meant that at the very beginning, the population of a <b>colonizing</b> <b>species</b> was a bit {{different from that of the}} remove, contributing population.|$|E
5000|$|The random {{fraction}} model {{describes a}} process where niche size is chosen at random by sequentially <b>colonizing</b> <b>species.</b> The initial species chooses a random {{portion of the}} total niche and subsequent <b>colonizing</b> <b>species</b> also choose a random portion of the total niche and divide it randomly until all species have colonized. Tokeshi (1990) found this model to be compatible with some epiphytic Chiromonid shrimp communities, and more recently {{it has been used}} to explain the relative abundance distributions of phytoplankton communities, salt meadow vegetation, some communities of insects in the order Diptera, some ground beetle communities, functional and taxonomic groupings of stream fish in Texas bio-regions, and ichneumonid parasitoids. A similar model was developed by Sugihara in an attempt to provide a biological explanation for the log normal distribution of Preston (1948). [...] Sugihara’s (1980) Fixed Division Model was similar to the random fraction model, but the randomness of the model is drawn from a triangular distribution with a mean of 0.75 rather that a normal distribution with a mean of 0.5 used in the random fraction. Sugihara used a triangular distribution to draw the random variables because the randomness of some natural populations matches a triangular distribution with a mean of 0.75.|$|E
40|$|Four woody species, Tamarix tentandra Pallas, Populus alba L. and Robinia pseudoacacia L. (planted) and Amorpha fruticosa L. (naturally colonized) {{were studied}} at two fly ash deposit lagoons, {{weathered}} 3 (L 1) and 11 years (L 2). All species were assessed {{in terms of}} their invasive ability, photosynthetic efficiency, photosynthetic pigments and damage symptoms, while the characteristics of the habitat were assessed in terms of trace element content and the pH and EC of the ash. A reduced vitality of all populations growing on the ash was observed, except for the naturally colonized A. fruticosa. High vitality on all sites, except at L 2, increased chlorophyll content and absence of damage symptoms indicates a tolerance in relation to the uptake of toxic elements from the ash. Therefore, the characteristics of naturally <b>colonized</b> <b>species</b> can be used for modeling future actions of biological restoration of fly ash deposits...|$|R

50|$|Cytisus scoparius {{is found}} in sunny sites, usually on dry, sandy soils at low altitudes, tolerating very acidic soil conditions. In some places outside of its native range, such as India, South America and western North America, {{particularly}} Vancouver Island, {{it has become an}} ecologically destructive <b>colonizing</b> invasive <b>species</b> in grassland, shrub and woodland, and other habitats. It is common in Great Britain and Ireland.|$|R
5000|$|Invasion {{was more}} likely in {{ecosystems}} that were {{similar to the one}} in which the potential invader evolved. Island ecosystems may be more prone to invasion because their species faced few strong competitors and predators, or because their distance from <b>colonizing</b> <b>species</b> populations makes them more likely to have [...] "open" [...] niches. An example of this phenomenon was the decimation of native bird populations on Guam by the invasive brown tree snake. Conversely, invaded ecosystems may lack the natural competitors and predators that check invasives' growth in their native ecosystems.|$|E
50|$|In {{the random}} {{assortment}} model the resource pool is divided at random among simultaneously or sequentially <b>colonizing</b> <b>species.</b> This pattern could arise because the abundance measure does not scale {{with the amount}} of niche occupied by a species or because temporal-variation in species abundance or niche breadth causes discontinuity in niche apportionment over time and thus species appear to have no relationship between extent of occupancy and their niche. Tokeshi (1993) explained that this model, in many ways, is similar to Caswell’s neutral theory of biodiversity, mainly because species appear to act independently of each other.|$|E
50|$|In 1926, Henry Gleason {{presented}} an alternative hypothesis in which plants were conceptualized as individuals rather than {{components of a}} superorganism. Gleason suggested that the distribution of various species across the landscape reflected species-specific dispersal limitations and environmental requirements rather than predetermined associations among species. Gleason {{set the stage for}} future research on priority effects by explaining that initially identical ponds colonized by different species could develop through succession into very different communities. Thus, Gleason contested the idea of a predetermined climax community and recognized that different <b>colonizing</b> <b>species</b> could produce alternative trajectories of community development.|$|E

25|$|The {{ability of}} the same AM fungi to <b>colonize</b> many <b>species</b> of plants has {{ecological}} implications. Plants of different species can be linked underground to a common mycelial network. One plant may provide the photosynthate carbon {{for the establishment of}} the mycelial network that another plant of a different species can utilize for mineral uptake. This implies that arbuscular mycorrhizae are able to balance below-ground intra–and interspecific plant interactions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Changes in gene {{regulation}} {{are thought to}} be crucial for the adaptation of organisms to their environment. Transcriptome analyses can be used to identify candidate genes for ecological adaptation, but can be complicated by variation in gene expression between tissues, sexes, or individuals. Here we use high-throughput RNA sequencing of a single Drosophila melanogaster tissue to detect brain-specific differences in gene expression between the sexes and between two populations, one from the ancestral species range in sub-Saharan Africa and one from the recently <b>colonized</b> <b>species</b> range in Europe. Results Relatively few genes (Cyp 6 g 1 and CHKov 1). Conclusions Analysis of the brain transcriptome revealed many genes differing in expression between populations that were not detected in previous studies using whole flies. There was little evidence for sex-specific regulatory adaptation in the brain, as most expression differences between populations were observed in both males and females. The enrichment of genes with sexually dimorphic expression on the X chromosome is consistent with dosage compensation mechanisms affecting sex-biased expression in somatic tissues. </p...|$|R
50|$|Red matipo is a fast growing, early <b>colonizing</b> <b>species,</b> yet {{can also}} survive within dense forest understorey, {{and so it}} is {{therefore}} tolerant of varying environmental conditions, such as light. As it is found throughout the North, South and Stewart Islands, its climatic tolerance is also high, and once established can live within drought prone, and also frost prone, conditions. Red matipo grows well on most soil types. showed that on average, a high level of phosphorus in the soil is beneficial to red matipo’s growth, however it consistently persists at low phosphorus levels, and is altered little in comparison to other New Zealand native plants.|$|E

The alien reaction to human warfare in the director's cut was explained to be a result of their monitoring of radio communications and copying the memories of the dead submarine crew; their interactions with the crew of Deep Core finally persuaded them to halt their attack on the coastlines and instead attempt peaceful contact.|$|E
50|$|Forest {{succession}} is {{the process}} by which species recover and regenerate after a disturbance. The type of disturbance, the climate and weather conditions, the presence of <b>colonizing</b> <b>species,</b> and the interactions among species all influence the path that succession will take.Species diversity and composition fluctuate throughout succession. The classic model of succession is known as relay floristics and refers to a relay of dominant species. After a stand-replacing disturbance, shade-intolerant species colonize and grow into a dominant canopy, but due to their shade-intolerance they are unable to regenerate under their own canopy; the understory (composed of shade-tolerant species) gradually replaces the canopy, and due to its shade-tolerance it can regenerate under its own canopy and therefore becomes the dominant species.Often succession is not so complete or directed as the relay floristics model describes. Species can be mid-tolerant of shade and survive by taking advantage of small amounts of light coming through the canopy, and further disturbances can create small gaps. These and other factors can lead to a mixture of dominant species and a not so obvious “end” to succession (climax community).|$|E
