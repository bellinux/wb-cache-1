The train, which consisted of the coal-powered steam engine #777, plus a <b>combination</b> <b>mail</b> and baggage car, an additional baggage car, one coach and one Pullman sleeping car, was traveling at about 25-30 mph and was derailed as it crossed over the south end of Wells Gulch at bridge 389.60. The trestle supporting the tracks had been destroyed by fire sometime in the previous twelve hours. The last train to cross over the same spot, had been the same train and crew at about 7:40am the morning of the crash when it was traveling between Grand Junction and Delta, on its way to Montrose, Colorado.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: E-mail {{communication}} is a narrative challenging in present days, because a {{problem can be}} done in that communication from one to other emails process generation. The problem is spam <b>mail</b> <b>combination</b> in original <b>mail</b> interaction. This is the major task for sending information from one to other persons, if it important to that particular person. So to solve these problems effectively traditionally a novel e-mail abstraction scheme, which considers e-mail layout structure to represent e-mails. In this technique a procedure to generate the e-mail abstraction using HTML content in e-mail, and this newly devised abstraction can more effectively capture the near-duplicate phenomenon of spams. In that instead of mapping each subsequence in a node of spam tree. In this paper we propose to replace with a special hash function namely SimHash, the advantage of this over other hash functions is that it sets a minimum on the number of members that the two sets must share in order to match. This mitigates the effect of extremely common set members on data clusters. SimHash based approach is Fast, Flexible, Customizable (HtmlSimhash), Scalable and is Google patented.

The helmets consisted of a sliding nose guard {{with a piece of}} chainmail hanging from it designed to protect the neck and shoulders. Armor was not just limited to human soldiers but extended to their horses and elephants as well. The horse armor was made up of mail and plates or lamellae which covered the neck, chest, and hindquarters underneath which was some form of padding to keep it in place while a face plate protected the animal’s face. The elephants, used as a battering ram or to break and trample enemy lines, were also donned in armor for battle. The elephant's head was covered by a steel mask and covered half of the trunk while the throat and sides were protected by lamellae armor while the tusks were tipped with sharp metal.|$|R
50|$|According to Bobrov {{the first}} mail and plate armor {{appeared}} as cuisses in the Middle East, and were imported by the Golden Horde. Persian miniatures {{of the first}} half of 15th century show different <b>combinations</b> of <b>mail</b> and plate armour with lamellar armor and brigandines sometimes worn with a single round mirror plate as breast re-enforcement. The first representation of mail and plate armour as body protection is shown in Persian miniatures, which show mail and plate armour composed of relatively large plates, worn with laminar pauldrons and skirt (formed from long, horizontal plates), re-enforced by a large round mirror plate. The first representation of classic mail and plate armour (without lamellar elements) can be seen in Baghdad's miniature which dates from 1465. From the end of the 15th century mail and plate armour began to fully replace lamellar armours. The main difference between eastern European (Russian and Polish) and Oriental mail and plate armor (according to Bobrov) is that eastern European versions usually do not have sleeves, while Oriental versions have sleeves (the forearms were protected by vambraces). In a heavy version these sleeves have embedded plates, and a light version (more widely used) has sleeves entirely made from mail.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The optimal {{management}} of croup – a common respiratory illness {{in young children}} – is well established. In particular, treatment with corticosteroids {{has been shown to}} significantly reduce the rate and duration of intubation, hospitalization, and return to care for on-going croup symptoms. Furthermore treatment with a single dose of corticosteroids does not appear to result in any significant adverse outcomes, and yields overall cost-savings for both families and the health care system. However, as has been shown with many other diseases, there is a significant gap between what we know and what we do. The overall aim {{of this study is to}} identify, from a societal perspective, the costs and associated benefits of three strategies for implementing a practice guideline that addresses the {{management of}} croup. Methods/designs We propose to use a matched pair cluster trial in 24 Alberta hospitals randomized into three intervention groups. We will use mixed methods to assess outcomes including linkage and analysis of administrative databases obtained from Alberta Health and Wellness, retrospective medical chart audit, and prospective telephone surveys of the parents of children diagnosed to have croup. The intervention strategies to be compared will be mailing of printed educational materials (low intensity intervention), <b>mailing</b> plus a <b>combination</b> of interactive educational meetings, educational outreach visits, and reminders (intermediate intensity intervention), and a <b>combination</b> of <b>mailing,</b> interactive sessions, outreach visits, reminders plus identification of local opinion leaders and establishment of local consensus processes (high intensity intervention). The primary objective is to determine which of the three intervention strategies are most effective at lowering the rate of hospital days per 1, 000 disease episodes. Secondary objectives are to determine which of the three dissemination strategies are most effective at increasing the use of therapies of known benefit. An economic analysis will be conducted to determine which of the three intervention strategies will most effectively reduce total societal costs including all health care costs, costs borne by the family, and costs stemming from the strategies for disseminating guidelines. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this thesis was directed towards {{the analysis of the}} inter-relationships between management practices and productive performance on a survey group of 30 north-east Wairarapa hill country farms. The initial survey, which essentially concentrated on the period between ewe weaning and tupping, incorporated a <b>combination</b> of <b>mail</b> and personal interview techniques. In addition, sample liveweights of ewe hoggets in autumn (April 1) and of two tooth and mixed aged (MA) ewes prior to mating were obtained to describe production levels more objectively. Preliminary results and appanent opportunities for improving the management of existing production systems were presented to the survey farmers as a group. As a consequence, a follow-up mail survey directed at management practices and associated production levels during the winter and spring (post-mating to weaning) was implemented in August 1983. Sample liveweights of ewe hoggets at spring shearing and ewe and lamb weights at weaning were collected. Results were discussed with the 29 participating farmers. Descriptive statistical methods (e. g. frequencies, cross-tabulation) were initially used to describe farm physical characteristics and the management systems employed. Subsequently, multivariate techniques (regression and MANOVA) were used to estimate the relative importance of different management strategies and farm physical characteristics on system performance. The major recommendation from this study is that increased emphasis should be placed on rearing ewe lambs so that they achieve a liveweight of 35 kg or more by May 1. The average April 1 ewe lamb liveweight on the survey farms in 1983 was 30. 2 kg (range, 18. 7 - 40. 0 kg). Other recommendations include mid-October or later commencement of calving, delaying ewe mating until April 1, earlier weaning of lambs and calves in dry summer areas (8 - 10 weeks and 12 weeks average age respectively) and increasing the winter rotation lengths of ewes. It is suggested that {{a large proportion of the}} potential level of production on hill country can be realised inexpensively through relatively small changes to existing management practices (such as those mentioned above) and associated management control of production system performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to examine processes of activity scheduling and rescheduling by experiments. Activity scheduling processes were examined by using a <b>combination</b> of <b>mail</b> surveys and telephone interviews. It was found that individuals’ schedules are hardly complete. Scheduled activities take place less than 50 % of all executed activities. The incompleteness suggests that activity scheduling and execution are a concurrent process and the distiction between is vague. Activities with relatively high level of fixity (e. g., work activity, educational and organizational activities) {{are more likely to be}} executed than other activities. Routine activities are no more or less likely to be scheduled than non-routine activities. Attributes of activities differ substantially between scheduling and execution. In particular, the deviation between scheduling and execution in starting time appears to be smaller than that in duration. Two suggestions may be offered: individuals may be able to schedule starting time more precisely than duration or individuals may respond to unexpected events by adjusting activity duration first. Activity rescheduling processes were examined by asking subjects to talk aloud while completing controlled in-lab scenarios. It was found that the actual rescheduling processes deviate greatly from the ideal utility maximization framework. More specifically, it was found that subjects rarely assess the overall situation before rescheduling operations; rarely evaluate multiple alternatives that are available before rescheduling operations; rarely revise previously rescheduled activities; the search for rescheduling is multi-directional, but most forward-moving; and subjects are quite efficient in the process of arriving their final revised schedules. Based on findings on activity rescheduling processes, a structure of activity rescheduling was proposed. The proposed structure adopts Hayes-Roth and Hayes-Roth’s model structure of errand planning in that it consists of several independent cognitive specialists and the flow of operation is not pre-fixed. The theory of active choice set was also proposed, asserting that subjects select which activity to be rescheduled next based upon how recently this activity is assessed...|$|R

40|$|Understanding fishers' {{responses}} to marine spatial closures {{is important for}} both resource users and managers. Fishing is a major recreational activity in Australia, and recreational fishers are key local resource users within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. In 2004, implementation of a new zoning plan in the park resulted in {{a reduction in the}} amount of area available to recreational fishing. A <b>combination</b> of phone, <b>mail,</b> and face-to-face surveys was used to investigate recreational fishers' choices and spatial redistribution strategies in response to the reduction in fishing area. Approximately 56 % of fishers reported losing at least one of their regular fishing locations under the new zoning plan. Fishers generally compensated by shifting their fishing effort to other areas they knew to be good fishing locations, and by finding new areas that they had not exploited previously. Potential implications of these spatial changes in recreational fishing effort for both the marine park and recreational fishers include changes in fishing frequency and satisfaction, reduced fishing quality, restricted access to areas considered to be of high quality for recreational fishing, increased crowding in areas that remain open to fishing, and increased likelihood of localized depletions in popular recreational fishing locations. Identification of the drivers of the spatial distribution of fishing effort, factors affecting fishers' choices of locations, and adaptation strategies adopted by fishers provide a valuable tool to help understand the impact of spatial fishing closures on fishers and resources...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of personalized mail and telephone interventions to improve follow-up to vision care in patients with diabetes. The project was divided in two parts. In the first study, 521 patients with diabetes who were due for a follow-up dilated fundus examination (DFE) were randomly assigned to receive 1) a single-mailed reminder form letter (usual care), or 2) a reminder letter plus an educational brochure, followed by a telephone call to schedule a DFE. In the second study, patients with diabetes were randomly assigned to receive 1) a single-mailed reminder letter (usual care), or 2) a personalized reminder letter plus an educational brochure or, 3) usual reminder letter plus a telephone call to schedule the DFE. Barriers to care utilization were also captured. The primary outcome was completion of a DFE within 3 months of suggested return date (timely appointment). Overall, all intervention groups were similar regarding demographic characteristics with a majority being female and African American. A <b>combination</b> of personalized <b>mail</b> and telephone communications and telephone communications alone were more effective in improving DFE adherence than a strategy based solely on standard mailed reminders. However, including an educational brochure did not enhance the effectiveness of the telephone-based intervention. Most commonly reported barriers to scheduling a DFE included busy schedule and issues with health insurance. In summary, a low cost telephone-based intervention significantly improves DFE adherence in an urban primary eye care setting. Presentation: 17 minute...|$|R
40|$|Today’s account {{management}} is complex. The market is extremely competitive, technology is making alternatives and low-distribution methods possible, product lifecycles are accelerating, and customers are becoming less loyal {{and more sophisticated}} {{while at the same}} time, becoming more demanding. A key challenge facing firms is to determine how to deploy highly effective account managers in order to perform in this complex environment. In this dissertation, I tested whether account manager (1) personality traits, (2) social network characteristics, and (3) emotional intelligence affected their sales performance. I then tested whether these three independent variables affected sales performance through various mediating variables including: (1) market intelligence use, (2) improvisation, and (3) adaptive selling behaviour. Finally, I tested the model by comparing between the Muslim and non-Muslim account managers due to the understanding that Islamic values influence the personality and behaviour of its followers. The research setting involved Muslim and non-Muslim account managers in Malaysia who managed sales of financial products such as shares, bonds, unit trusts, foreign exchange, and futures markets. A <b>combination</b> of <b>mail</b> and in-person survey was used to collect the data. A pilot test was conducted prior to final survey administration. Eighteen randomly selected account managers participated in the pilot test. Results and observations from the pilot test were used to finalise the survey. The finalised questionnaire was sent to 2, 122 account managers drawn randomly from the 29 registered finance companies, stock brokers, and banks in Malaysia. Four hundred ninety four usable questionnaires were returned yielding a 23. 3 percent response rate. Of the 494 replies, 280 were from Muslim account managers while the remaining 214 were from non-Muslim account managers. Data was analysed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The Goodness of Fit Index GFI, Comparative Fit Index CFI, and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation RMSEA were used as model fitness indicators. The missing data was analysed using Maximum Likelihood (ML). Overall, the results of the data illustrated strong support for the conceptual model. Market intelligence use and improvisation was found to mediate the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. More specifically, market intelligence use and improvisation were observed to mediate the relationship between openness to experience and sales performance, conscientiousness and sales performance, and network size and sales performance. Adaptive selling behaviour was found to mediate the relationship between emotional intelligence and sales performance. Finally, no significant statistical differences were observed between Muslim and non-Muslim managers. The results of this study contribute to sales management literature by understanding the role of mediators in the personality trait-sales performance relationship, social network characteristics-sales performance relationship, and emotional intelligence-sales performance relationship. Consequently, these findings indicate several managerial implications for recruitment, training, work practices, internal and relationship marketing, and policies at the workplace...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: Incidents, {{correlates}} {{and outcomes}} of lifetime sexual assault and unwanted sexual contact have rarely been investigated in older women. This is {{despite the fact}} that it is well known that very high rates of females experience such incidents throughout childhood and well into mid adulthood, along with a range of serious aversive consequences. Older women’s sexuality, generally, has received a limited degree of attention in the literature, and much remains unknown about the sexual experiences of women in older age. Both normal sexuality and forms of unwanted sexual contact in older women are likely to have been ignored in the literature previously, due to the general societal view that equates aging women with asexuality. This study reviewed the literature in these areas and undertook to explore the risk of aversive outcomes for older women who reported a lifetime history of sexual abuse, as well as any protective factors, particularly those relating to disposition (e. g., optimism, self-efficacy, self-esteem, internal locus of control) and social support. Method: Community-dwelling participants (N = 474; age range 44 to 83 in 2004), were drawn from the Longitudinal Assessment of Women (LAW) study, and in 2004, participated in an interview about their sexual abuse history. Further data was collected through a <b>combination</b> of <b>mailed</b> questionnaires (in 2004, 2007 and 2008), and a personal clinical interview conducted by a physician in 2008. Results: A history of sexual abuse was reported by 27. 49 % of women, with most incidents occurring in childhood. Women’s reports of lifetime sexual abuse declined with age. In 2008, 10. 85 % of the total remaining sample had a clinical psychiatric diagnosis. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses demonstrated that psychopathology was predicted from a history of sexual abuse (with an Odds Ratio of 2. 39), after taking into account the predictive effects of neuroticism (with an Odds Ratio of 2. 32) and other factors (e. g. demographic). Participants reporting sexual abuse were more likely to have lower perceived social support and to be higher on the personality factor openness, though they did not differ on dispositional features. Dispositional factors also did not predict a reduced risk of psychopathology. In 2008 when the clinical interview was conducted, missing participants (comprising 20. 3 % of the original sample) were noted to have had lower scores on income, education, agreeableness, self-efficacy and internal locus of control. Conclusions: Sexual abuse, even occurring much earlier in life, appears to place older women at greater risk of psychopathology and is associated with reduced perceived social support. Dispositional factors may not always be affected by sexual abuse, or otherwise, may recover with time. Older women may be at particular risk from effects of sexual abuse, due to competing social messages received about sexuality. Women may desire the ability to express sexuality in a changed and more affectionate way as they age, which may conflict with social and medical messages transmitted to older men, raising issues of consent and common goals with respect to intimacy...|$|R

Data gaps for water exposure assessment include the duration and frequency of urban non-potable (non-drinking) water use. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to compare household water usage results obtained using two data collection tools, a computer assisted telephone interview (CATI) and a 7 -day water activity diary, in order to assess the effect of different methodological survey approaches on derived exposure estimates. Costs and logistical aspects of each data collection tool were also examined. Methods A total of 232 households in an Australian dual reticulation scheme (where households are supplied with two grades of water through separate pipe networks) were surveyed about their water usage using both a CATI and a 7 -day diary. Householders were questioned about their use of recycled water for toilet flushing, garden watering and other outdoor activities. Householders were also questioned about their water use in the laundry. Agreement between reported CATI and diary water usage responses was assessed. Results Results of this study showed that the level of agreement between CATI and diary responses was greater for more frequent water-related activities except toilet flushing and for those activities where standard durations or settings were employed. In addition, this study showed that the unit cost of diary administration was greater than for the CATI, excluding consideration of the initial selection and recruitment steps. Conclusion This study showed that it is possible to successfully 'remotely' coordinate diary completion providing that adequate instructions are given and that diary recording forms are well designed. In addition, good diary return rates can be achieved using a monetary incentive and the diary format allows for collective recording, rather than an individual's estimation, of household water usage. Accordingly, there is merit in further exploring the use of diaries for collection of water usage information either in <b>combination</b> with a <b>mail</b> out for recruitment, or potentially in the future with Internet-based recruitment (as household Internet uptake increases). </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{source of}} {{information}} for year 2011 encompassed in this document is monthly utilization statistical reports by Delaware nursing homes submitted to the University of Delaware's Center for Applied Demography & Survey Research. The center obtained a list of licensed nursing facilities {{at the beginning of}} the year from the Bureau of Health Planning & Resource Management. All changes to the list of licensed facilities, including name changes and changes in the number of licensed beds were communicated to the center by the bureau. Facilities were contacted on a monthly basis with requests sent the first day of the month. A combination of methods was used to contact the facilities on the list. The method was a <b>combination</b> of standard <b>mail</b> and e-mail, followed up by fax and phone. Using these methods, the center achieved full compliance from all facilities for all 12 months. When reports were received from individual facilities, the reports were checked for internal inconsistencies or unexpected changes in reported statistics. These discrepancies were immediately communicated back to the facilities with explanation and a request to update the data. Once an updated report was received by the center, the report was considered complete. All data collected was converted to an electronic format if not done so by the facility and then manually verified for consistency and accuracy. At the end of the reporting year, the data was recoded as needed and tabulated. This is the twenty-fifth edition of the Delaware Nursing Home Utilization Statistical Report. The report presents characteristics of Delaware's nursing homes and their patients. The data in this report does not include intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded (ICFMR). ICFMR facilities provide active treatment services to people with mental retardation and other related conditions causing adaptive behavior similar to that of the mentally retarded person which manifests before the person reaches the age of 22. Also, the report does not include data from facilities that serve the population under 18. This report was primarily funded by the State of Delaware’s Division of Public Health/Bureau of Health Planning & Resources Management...|$|R
40|$|As {{technology}} {{becomes increasingly}} more sophisticated, means {{and demand for}} digital communication are increasing. The geographical expansion of the business world has made communication alternatives critical to working together more effectively. Face to face meetings {{may not be possible}} or the most cost and time efficient approach. Also, there is a move towards working at home, telecommuting, by using electronic communication for interaction (Fitzgerald 1993). Thus, electronic correspondence is becoming essential and we are witnessing a move towards higher performance and potential for communication alternatives. Knowing the options and their appropriateness is a competitive advantage. 2 ̆ 2 In a information society dominated by computers and communications, value is increased by knowledge, {{as well as by the}} speed of movement of that knowledge. 2 ̆ 2 (Fitzgerald 1994). Graphic designers rely on strong communication with their clients. Clients 2 ̆ 7 needs must be expressed to the designer and designer 2 ̆ 7 s solutions must be communicated for approval. This process is repeated at several stages: initial, revision, and final. Traditionally, when face to face meetings were not feasible, comprehensives were mailed to the client. With the current move towards electronic communication, mail manual transportation are slower and possibly more expensive than electronic correspondence. With technology today, electronic correspondence may also include interactivity, voice, and video. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate alternative methods to face to face interaction between designer and client throughout the design approval process. The goal being to determine the appropriateness of each transmission application for information interchange of different kind of images and at different stages of the approval process. Appropriateness was to be determined by equipment, economic and time factors, interoperability, security, and aesthetic and communication quality. Facsimile technology, Adobe Acrobat 2 ̆ 7 s portable document formal files, the Internet, and videoconferencing were the vehicles analyzed as an electronic correspondence alternatives to face to face interaction. The vehicles were tested in two parts, through survey and actual transactions with graphic designers. Participants were provided questionnaires to evaluate and compare the visual and non visual aspects of each vehicle. This thesis did not test specific software or hardware, but rather the validity of the technique for interaction and transmission of data between designer and client throughout the design approval process. The test was in two parts. The first part was a survey sampling of 1 00 design sites, design firms and advertising agencies, to derive quantitative information on each transmission vehicle Based on the assessment of the appropriateness of each vehicle, determined by survey response in conjunction with background research, Facsimile technology, Adobe Acrobat, and videoconferencing were deemed appropriate for further testing. The Internet was deemed inappropriate. Three design sites were involved in comparing facsimile technology and PDF files to dye sublimation hardcopy prints. A video-conference was donated, conducted, and videotaped. Participants were asked to evaluate and compare visual and non-visual aspects of the transmitted comprehensives. The conclusion of this thesis project is that the technology is here to use for electronic alternatives to face to face interaction between clients. Some adjustments have to be made, though, before these technologies can be embraced completely. Electronic alternatives are not qualified for final approval because of lack of precision in color, lack of demonstrating production or finishing operations, and the quality of typography on monitors are extremely low causing the aesthetic quality to be extremely diminished. Second, the designers selected hardcopy as the best option for communicating the tested designs. This indicates the community is not ready to embrace electronic alternatives. This may be due to a lacking of advantage of the electronic option to deem them necessary and/or lack of comfortability with the electronic alternatives. Either reason, electronic alternatives to face to face interaction between client and designer is not, currenly, being fully accepted. As for the vehicles themselves, Adobe Acrobat was found to be a very appropriate product to use between designer and client to communicate design comprehensives for initial and revision stages. Facsimile transmissions are appropriate for initial comprehensives or for revisions of comprehensives already seen at higher quality by the client. The Internet is presently not appropriate for private one-to-one file transfer between client and designer. Its strengths do not outweigh its risks. Videoconferencing is electronic correspondence, not file transfer. It can be used in <b>combination</b> with <b>mail</b> carrier service and file transfer or alone. If the client has been sent appropriate final proofs and the conference is used for verbal and visual communication, it is appropriate for all stages. If the final proof has not been sent, it is very appropriate for initial and revision stages. In comparison to mail carriers, all electronic options transmission times were significantly faster. All transmissions were under a hour. Additionally, all alternatives except videoconferencing, were less expensive...|$|R
