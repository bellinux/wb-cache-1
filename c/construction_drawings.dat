25|$|Stage I {{commenced}} on 2 March 1959 {{with the}} construction firm Civil & Civic, monitored by the engineers Ove Arup and Partners. The government had pushed for work to begin early, fearing that funding, or public opinion, might turn against them. However, Utzon had still not completed the final designs. Major structural issues still remained unresolved. By 23 January 1961, work was running 47 weeks behind, mainly because of unexpected difficulties (inclement weather, unexpected difficulty diverting stormwater, construction beginning before proper <b>construction</b> <b>drawings</b> had been prepared, changes of original contract documents). Work on the podium was finally completed in February 1963. The forced early start led to significant later problems, not {{least of which was}} the fact that the podium columns were not strong enough to support the roof structure, and had to be re-built.|$|E
40|$|The propose of this {{research}} is to recognize the effectiveness of using model that dominance student performance in Geometry and Building Construction Drawing at Technique Secondary School. This research looks to course objective for determined the student performance on Geometry and Building Construction Drawing. The factors to determine {{this research}} are student attitude, student interested and teacher's teaching method. Research instrument that be used for this research are two set of questionnaires and model. All the data analyse are concluded in chart and schedule form. This research shows that, the student have positive attitude and students are interested in Geometry and Building <b>Construction</b> <b>Drawing's</b> class. They are so interested when model are introduced in Geometry and Building <b>Construction</b> <b>Drawing's</b> class. Emphasis focuses are to make teacher give mostly exposure in this subject. Teacher also can use many verities of teaching technique to make sure the student get high performance in Geometry and Building Construction Drawing...|$|R

However, the {{pride and joy}} of the State Museum of Contemporary Art is the works in the Kostaki collection, which was bought by the Greek State on 31 March 2000 for 14,200,000,000 drachmas. This collection consists of 1,275 works of art (oil paintings, <b>constructions,</b> <b>drawings</b> etc.) The works are by well-known, avant-garde Russian artists like K. Malevich, V. Tatlin, V. Kandinsky, El. Lissitzky, and L. Popova, among others. The West became familiar with the Kostaki collection through exhibitions in Düsseldorf, New York and Athens.|$|R
50|$|When {{she began}} making art {{her work was}} largely collage and drawings. She {{was working in the}} 1960s, when Abstract Expression was popular, and she was torn between {{abstract}} art and her love for material exploration. At 23, Grossman had her first solo exhibition at the Kasner gallery in New York City. Her artwork included collages, <b>constructions,</b> <b>drawings,</b> and paintings. In 1964 she moved to Elderidge Street in Chinatown and continued to work there. Her move afforded her more space, so she began assembling free standing pieces and wall assemblages of at least six feet by four feet.|$|R
25|$|In 1898, she {{enrolled}} {{for further}} graduate studies at Cornell University but fell seriously ill {{and had to}} drop out. During her recovery, she dreamt of building her own house and was encouraged by her friend, architect Bernard Maybeck, to sketch her ideas. After buying a small property near her beloved Blackberry Canyon in Berkeley with an inheritance, she hired an architect, William Knowles, to prepare the <b>construction</b> <b>drawings.</b> The House focuses on natural light and views of the San Francisco Bay. The home's exterior is clad with brown shingles as typical for First Bay Tradition houses. The interior featured local unpainted redwood paneling and built-in window seats that could be transformed into beds for visitors. In 1908 she added a studio on {{the upper part of}} the property which would later serve as her architectural office. For many years, Lillian Bridgman lived with her sister, Irene, a nurse, sometimes staying in the studio and renting out the front house to boarders.|$|E

A novel method for vectorizing construction engineering drawing images is presented. The method consists of two algorithms: a seed-segment based line-network vectorization algorithm and a knowledge-supported vectorization algorithm designed specially for <b>construction</b> engineering <b>drawings.</b> The seed-segment based algorithm converts a line wholly and a line network globally so that both the quality and speed are satisfied. The knowledge supported vectorization algorithm takes full use of the features and rules of <b>construction</b> engineering <b>drawings</b> to solve the difficulties of vectorization caused by noises and degradations.

Certainly, many children with strongly visual expressive and learning characteristics seem to also have language deficits, suggsting that the left hemisphere is playing a lesser part in their learning. A number of the children reported on here, for example, scored very low on verbal reasoning tests, displayed severe spelling deficits and had difficulty writing in conventional non-computer environments.

2500|$|Despite all setbacks, Siemens-Schuckert {{still wanted}} to sell the aircraft, and {{commenced}} another rebuild. The nose was redesigned again, into a rounded, blunt configuration with a gun position atop. The pilot's position was relocated either behind the nose windows or to an open cockpit {{on top of the}} fuselage. By now, the aircraft had acquired the nickname Ladenhüter (literally, [...] "shelf warmer" [...] or, idiomatically, [...] "white elephant") and pilots refused to fly it. Siemens-Schuckert director Walter Reichel negotiated a price discount for the Idflieg if they would accept the aircraft to a lower specification. The Idflieg accepted, and reduced the acceptance criteria to the aircraft reaching [...] in 30 minutes while carrying a useful load of [...] and enough fuel for an endurance of 4 hours. Reichel now offered Bruno and Franz Steffen ten percent of the sale price if they could perform an acceptance flight to meet the Idfliegs requirements.

2500|$|The {{band and}} their {{creative}} team focused initial meetings {{on what they}} wanted to communicate to the audience and how to make them feel. After defining the thematic arc of the show, the stage design began to take shape. Devlin explained the creative team's approach in designing the multifaceted stage: [...] "We wanted to respond to the geometry of an arena: all that oval air, how to energize the whole mass of air in those spaces so that the atmosphere reaches everyone in the room equally." [...] Williams found it beneficial to collaborate with two separate firms, Devlin's company and Stufish, on the stage because of their contrasting work methods. Devlin's team created physical models, while Lipson's team made animations and collaborated with Tait on <b>construction</b> <b>drawings.</b> Fisher was unable to physically attend any meetings after the first one, but did occasionally videoconference with the creative team via Skype. In the final meeting he attended before his death in June 2013, when Bono asked the team to think of an object that could symbolise U2 and be incorporated into the stage design, Fisher suggested a cross; the idea would be implemented into some of the stage's lighting fixtures.|$|E
