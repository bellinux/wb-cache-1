40|$|National audienceSound {{generation}} in fricative consonants is traditionally supposed to depend {{only on the}} Reynolds Number, usually defined by the constriction area and the static volume velocity at the constriction. The potential influence of the three-dimensional geometry of the constriction and the time-varying nature of the flow through the constriction are often ignored, despite the effect these factors may have on turbulent jet formation and aeroacoustic source generation. This paper investigates the interaction between constriction geometry and static and dynamic flow conditions using mechanical modelling and computer simulation experiments. Rapid prototyping is used to create stereolithographic models of an elliptical duct representing the vocal tract, for elliptical, laminar, and grooved <b>constriction</b> <b>shapes</b> that share the same area function, employing a feedback-regulated Kolvenbach flow valve controlled by computer to inject carefully-shaped dynamic modulations of the air flow about a series of static flow levels into each model. Source and filter components extracted using multitaper analysis from the far-field sound spectrum recorded with a microphone characterize the acoustic behaviour of each model {{as a function of}} <b>constriction</b> <b>shape</b> and flow condition. Large-eddy simulations of three-dimensional viscous incompressible flow are used to visualize the development of the turbulent flow field and aeroacoustic source distribution in the same computer geometries that were used to create each mechanical model, coupling the equivalent source field calculated using Howe's analogy to a quasi-one-dimensional simulation of acoustic wave propagation to predict the radiated sound spectrum. The adequacy of the traditional quasi-static and quasi-one-dimensional account of sound {{generation in}} fricatives is assessed by comparing the results of the two experiments. Dynamic effects appear to be relatively unimportant, whereas the perimeter of the constriction rather than the cross-sectional area may be the appropriate parameter characterizing the geometry...|$|R

The effects of various {{parameters of the}} two fluids and the sizes of the constriction geometry are considered. The numerical computation for the current problem requires a highly-accurate and efficient method owing to the very small/large deformation of the droplet shape at low/high flow rates, the small droplet-solid gap and the complicated three-dimensional geometries. An efficient fully-implicit three-dimensional Spectral Boundary Element method developed by Dimitrakopoulos is employed. Our {{results show that the}} droplet dynamics is significantly influenced by the non-symmetric shape of the rectangular cross-sectional constriction, i. e. owing to the <b>constriction</b> <b>shape</b> the droplet deforms much less in the flow-direction by forming a flat disk shape. As the capillary number is decreased, the droplet deformation in the flow-direction decreases owing to the larger surface tension.

40|$|The classic {{model of}} voiced fricatives {{includes}} two sound sources, a periodic glottal source and a random noise source at the constriction. The amplitude {{of the noise}} source has long been assumed to be modulated by the voicing (Fan, 1960; Stevens, 1971; Flanagan, 1972), but the amount of this change has not been studied systematically, {{and the possibility of}} a change in spectral shape has been ignored. Spectral analysis of a voiced fricative that is F 0 -synchronized by the use of a simultaneous laryngograph channel shows that modulation of the noise source by voicing causes not only amplitude changes but also changes in the spectral shape. These changes, consisting of a 5 -dB variation in amplitude above 10 kHz in [v], are consistent with changes observed in time-averaged spectra of sustained fricatives at different effort levels, and with spectra of mechanical models having different <b>constriction</b> <b>shapes.</b> The amount of spectral change due to such modulation is likely to vary with strength and place of the noise source, and thus will depend on the particular glottis-constriction coordination employed by the speaker.

But it is exactly this emphasis on “normality” which attracts criticism, as both museums are accused of detracting {{from the fact that}} the GDR had been a dictatorship (“Unrechtsstaat”). But does the museal presentation of everyday life necessarily distract museum visitors from the political oppression and severe <b>constrictions</b> which <b>shaped</b> life in the GDR? In response to criticism such as Hubertus Knabe‟s claim that in these museums the GDR is presented as “sozialpolitisches Großexperiment und nicht als menschenverachtende Diktatur,” one could argue that daily life in the GDR can not be uncoupled from the political regime. Even so, the criticism directed towards these museums ranges from accusations of blatant “Ostalgie” to a more differentiated scepticism regarding the museums‟s forms of representation. In this talk I will investigate these claims and try to contextualise the debates in a global landscape of remembrance which informs 21 and therefore helps to understand the memory contests taking place in Germany. Questions: Why is the GDR memory landscape divided into the everyday and the political sphere? What are the major problems with this dichotomy? What are the political implications of the different museal strategies to transform communicative into cultural memory?

We consider a capsule with a stress-free spherical shape and impose its steady state configuration in an infinitely long straight channel as the initial condition for our calculations. We report how the capsule deformation, velocity, retention time, and maximum stress of the membrane {{are affected by the}} capillary number, Ca, and the <b>constriction</b> <b>shape.</b> We estimate the deformation by measuring the variation of the three-dimensional surface area and a series of alternative quantities easier to extract from experiments. These are the Taylor parameter, the perimeter and the area of the capsule in the spanwise plane. We find that the perimeter is the quantity that reproduces the behavior of the three-dimensional surface area the best. We observe that, in general, area-deformation correlated quantities grow linearly with Ca, while velocity-correlated quantities saturate for large Ca but display a steeper increase for small Ca. The velocity of the capsule divided by the velocity of the flow displays, surprisingly, two different qualitative behaviors for small and large capillary numbers. Finally, we report that longer constrictions and spanwise wall bounded (versus spanwise periodic) domains cause larger deformations and velocities. If the deformation and velocity in the spanwise wall bounded domains are rescaled by the initial equilibrium deformation and velocity, their behavior is undistinguishable from that in a periodic domain. In contrast, a remarkably different behavior is reported in sinusoidally shaped and smoothed rectangular constrictions indicating that the capsule dynamics is particularly sensitive to abrupt changes in the cross section. In a smoothed rectangular constriction larger deformations and velocities occur over a larger distance...|$|R

Polarized {{trafficking}} of adhesion receptors plays {{a pivotal}} role in controlling cellular behavior during morphogenesis. Particulary, clathrin-dependent endocytosis of integrins has long been acknowledged as essential for cell migration. However, little is known on how oriented integrin trafficking contributes to the morphogenesis of epithelial tissues. In our laboratory we studied how the transmembrane protein Opo, previously described for its essential role during optic cup folding, plays a fundamental role in this process. Through interaction with the PTB domain of the clathrin adaptors Numb/Numbl via an integrin-like NPxF motif, Opo antagonizes Numb/Numbl function and acts as a negative regulator of integrin endocytosis. Accordingly, num/numbl gain-of-function experiments in teleost embryos mimic the retinal malformations observed in opo mutants. Taking advantage of the polarized architectute of the vertebrate retina, we studied the folding of the optic cup as a model system for epithelial basal constriction. We propose that the developmental regulators Numb/Numbl and Opo are essential components of the endocytic machinery directing the basal <b>constriction</b> that <b>shapes</b> the vertebrate retina epithelium.

40|$|Acoustic {{patterns}} for fricatives {{are difficult to}} characterise in spectral terms. They show consistency within one speaker but much cross-speaker variation (Hughes and Halle [1]). For our two main speakers, analysis of anechoic recordings has shown this within-speaker consistency while it suggests that the lower front cavity resonance {{is associated with a}} different format number in the two cases (Shadle et al. [2]). The location in time of perceptual cues may vary for different fricatives, with /f/ and /theta/ for example distinguished more by transitions {{at the edges of the}} frication noise segments than by the spectra within this segment (Harris [3]). Aerodynamic processes are a crucial factor in the production of fricatives. Aerodynamic conditions and the configurations of the articulators at and near a vocal tract constriction combine to produce the acoustic output associated with that fricative. To gain more understanding of the mechanisms that are involved we need to have information about these aerodynamic processes and about the vocal tract <b>constriction</b> size, <b>shape</b> and location. At present it is extremely difficult to infer three-dimensional shapes.

Surprisingly, Cno is not essential for AJ assembly or for AJ maintenance in many tissues. However, morphogenesis is impaired from the start.

Regulators and effectors of the small GTPase Rho {{have been shown to}} be essential for epithelial morphogenesis in cell culture; however, the mechanism by which Rho GTPase and its downstream effectors control coordinated movement of epithelia in a developing tissue or organ is largely unknown. Here, we show that Rho 1 GTPase activity is required for the invagination of Drosophila embryonic salivary gland epithelia and for directed migration of the internalized gland. We demonstrate that the absence of zygotic function of Rho 1 results in the selective loss of the apical proteins, Crumbs (Crb), Drosophila atypical PKC and Stardust during gland invagination and that this is partially due to reduced crb RNA levels and apical localization. In parallel to regulation of crb RNA and protein, Rho 1 activity also signals through Rho-kinase (Rok) to induce apical <b>constriction</b> and cell <b>shape</b> change during invagination. After invagination, Rho-Rok signaling is required again for the coordinated contraction and dorsal migration of the proximal half of the gland. We also show that Rho 1 activity is required for proper development of the circular visceral mesoderm upon which the gland migrates. Our genetic and live-imaging analyses provide novel evidence that the proximal gland cells play an essential and active role in salivary gland migration that propels the entire gland to turn and migrate posteriorly...|$|R

The shape of the stenosis in the arterial lumen is chosen to be symmetric as well as asymmetric about the middle cross section perpendicular to the axis of the tube in order to improve resemblance to the in-vivo situation. The constricted tube is transformed into a straight tube and the resulting governing equations are solved by a numerical method with Reynolds number and ‘n’, a number giving the <b>shape</b> of the <b>constriction</b> as parameters. The influences of these parameters on the haemodynamic factors like wall shear stress, pressure and velocity have been analyzed. The present findings demonstrate that the flow resistance decreases as the shape of a smooth stenosis changes and maximum resistance is attained in case of a symmetric stenosis.

40|$|Apical <b>constriction</b> changes cell <b>shapes,</b> driving {{critical}} morphogenetic events, including gastrulation {{in diverse}} organisms and neural tube closure in vertebrates. Apical constriction {{is thought to}} be triggered by contraction of apical actomyosin networks. We found that apical actomyosin contractions began before cell shape changes in both Caenorhabitis elegans and Drosophila. In C. elegans, actomyosin networks were initially dynamic, contracting and generating cortical tension without substantial shrinking of apical surfaces. Apical cell-cell contact zones and actomyosin only later moved increasingly in concert, with no detectable change in actomyosin dynamics or cortical tension. Thus, apical constriction appears to be triggered not by a change in cortical tension, but by dynamic linking of apical cell-cell contact zones to an already contractile apical cortex. During development, dramatic rearrange-ments of cells and epithelia play key rolesin shaping animals (1 – 4). Many rearrange- ments are driven by apical constriction, includ-ing neural tube closure (4), failure of which is acommon human birth defect (5). Apical constric-tion is generally driven by contraction of apical actomyosin networks (4). However, it is not well understood how the stresses and tensions gen-erated by actomyosin networks produce cell shape changes in developing organisms (6). To address this issue, we examined cortical ac-tomyosin dynamics during Caenorhabitis elegans gastrulation. In C. elegans, two endodermal pre-cursor cells (Ea and Ep) internalize through apical constriction (7 – 9). Transgenic green fluorescent protein (GFP) myosin II–containing particles formed in each cell’s apical cortex, enriched in Ea/p similarly to endogenous myosin (9). The ability to resolve large numbers of particles made it possible to track the detailed dynamics of ac...|$|R
40|$|Human {{bone marrow}} mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) cultured on {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) nanofibrous scaffolds {{are known to}} undergo osteogenic differentiation {{even in the absence}} of soluble osteoinductive factors. Although this process of differentiation has been attributed to the shape that cells assume on the fibrous scaffolds, it is unclear how <b>constriction</b> of cell <b>shape</b> would contribute to the differentiation phenotype. Here, we quantitatively compared cell and nuclear morphologies of cells cultured on 3 D poly(ecaprolactone) (PCL) nanofibers (NF) and two-dimensional (2 D) flat films using confocal fluorescence microscopy. We discovered that while cells on the 2 D films exhibited cellular and nuclear morphologies similar to those cultured on tissue culture polystyrene, cells cultured on the 3 D NF showed distinct cell and nuclear morphologies, with lower areas and perimeters, but higher aspect ratios. We next tested the effect of treatment of cells with actin-depolymerizing cytochalasin D and microtubule-depolymerizing nocodazole on these morphologies. In both 2 D and 3 D scaffolds, actin depolymerization brought about gross changes in cell and nuclear morphologies. Remarkably, microtubule depolymerization resulted in a phenotype similar to actin depolymerization in cells cultured on 3 D NF alone, indicating a significant role for the microtubule cytoskeleton in the maintenance of cell shape and structure in 3 D. The morphological changes of the nucleus that were apparent upon cytoskeletal perturbation were reflected in the organization of heterochromatin in the nucleus, with MSCs on 3 D alone exhibiting a differentiation phenotype. Finally, we tested the effect of cytoskeletal depolymerization on mineralization of cells. Again, we observed higher mineralization in cells cultured on 3 D NF, which was lost in cells treated with either cytochalasin D or nocodazole. Taken together, our results suggest that both the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons contribute significantly toward maintenance of cell and nuclear shape in cells cultured on 3 D scaffolds, and consequently to their osteogenic differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Shape {{processing}} {{defines a}} set of theoretical and algorithmic tools for creating, measuring and modifying digital representations of shapes.  Such tools are of paramount importance to many disciplines of computer graphics, including modeling, animation, visualization, and image processing.  Many applications of shape processing {{can be found in}} the entertainment and medical industries. In an attempt to improve upon many previous shape processing techniques, the present thesis explores the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of a difference measure, which involves fitting a ball (disk in 2 D and sphere in 3 D) so that it has at least one tangential contact with each shape and the ball interior is disjoint from both shapes. We propose {{a set of}} ball-based operators and discuss their properties, implementations, and applications.  We divide the group of ball-based operations into unary and binary as follows: Unary operators include: * Identifying details (sharp, salient features, <b>constrictions)</b> * Smoothing <b>shapes</b> by removing such details, replacing them by fillets and roundings * Segmentation (recognition, abstract modelization via centerline and radius variation) of tubular structures Binary operators include: * Measuring the local discrepancy between two shapes * Computing the average of two shapes * Computing point-to-point correspondence between two shapes * Computing circular trajectories between corresponding points that meet both shapes at right angles * Using these trajectories to support smooth morphing (inbetweening) * Using a curve morph to construct surfaces that interpolate between contours on consecutive slices The technical contributions of this thesis focus on the implementation of these tangent-ball operators and their usefulness in applications of shape processing. We show specific applications in the areas of animation and computer-aided medical diagnosis.  These algorithms are simple to implement, mathematically elegant, and fast to execute. Ph. D.

40|$|National audienceThis {{presentation}} {{deals on}} acoustic salience of vowels and consonants predicted from articulatory modeling (AM). An articulatory model describes vocal tract (VT) profiles {{with a small}} number of parameters that are interpretable in phonetic terms. Such a modeling allows {{a better understanding of the}} relationship between articulatory configurations and acoustic patterns. The goal of this paper is twofold. The first part is rather an introduction to the issue and aims to illustrate AM. The advantages and limits of studying speech with different types of modeling, such as simple models of VT area function and more elaborated AM, are very briefly reviewed, and articulatory models are introduced. In anthropological Maeda's model, the area function is reconstructed with seven articulatory parameters: one for the jaw position, three for the tongue, two for the lips and one for larynx height. Such an AM makes it possible to evaluate the separate contribution of individual parameters to the vowel formants, and their interaction. In the second part, I propose some hints to complement the traditional way of transcribing the sounds and coarticulatory effects by acoustic and articulatory notation. It is based on the notion of the Fpattern defined by Fant (1960) and the use of Maeda's model to explore the maximal articulatory and F-pattern spaces. Such exploration reveals the similarities of the F-pattern among vowels, semi-vowels, and consonants that share a similar tongue position and shape and lip configuration, but differing in the <b>constriction</b> size and <b>shape.</b> Exploring the whole F-pattern space helps to define prototypical vowels specified mainly by specific acoustic characteristics, and which may serve as references. This approach makes it possible to describe subtle but audible and consistent differences between the realizations of a similar phoneme of different languages traditionally represented by the same IPA symbols. Moreover, it incorporates coarticulatory and positional influences therefore thus uncovering the seeds for perceptual confusions among sounds due to their immediate phonetic context, which in turn can cause sound changes...|$|R
40|$|Superconducting {{nanowires}} have been, {{for years}} now, {{a topic of}} great interest due to their potential application in single photon detectors and in quantum computing circuits. In this context, it is of fundamental importance {{to better understand the}} undesired and harmful appearance of thermal and quantum fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter [1]-[3] {{as a function of the}} wire width. Although superconductors in the mesoscopic regime (i. e. size comparable to ξ and/or λ) have been explored both experimentally and theoretically in depth, the superconducting nanoworld (i. e. at scales of the fermi wavelength) has received much less attention. The lack of experimental results is in part due to the difficulty of sample fabrication, at dimensions beyond the limit reached by conventional lithographic techniques. A promising direction consists of controlling the local displacement of atom by an electron wind, a process known as electromigration (EM) [4]. This effect relies on the combination of local temperature rise and substantial current crowding at nanoconstrictions. While uncontrolled, EM is responsible for the breakdown of small electronic devices, it can be used in a controllable way to further decrease locally the cross section of the nanowire towards single atomic contacts. In this work, we explore in-situ controlled EM to fabricate nano-constrictions immersed in cryogenic environment. We demonstrate that a transition from thermally assisted phase slips (TAPS) to quantum phase slips (QPS) takes place when the effective cross section becomes smaller than ~ 150 nm 2. In the regime dominated by QPS the nanowire loses completely its capacity to carry current without dissipation, even at the lowest possible temperature [5]. We also demonstrate that the bow-tie <b>shaped</b> <b>constrictions</b> exhibit a negative magnetoresistance at low magnetic fields [5] which can be attributed to the suppression of superconductivity in the contact leads [6]. Strikingly, the detrimental effect caused by the repeated EM can be healed by simply inverting the current direction. These findings reveal the strong potential of the proposed fabrication method to explore various fascinating superconducting phenomena in atomic-size constrictions...|$|R
