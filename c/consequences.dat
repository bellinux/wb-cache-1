50|$|Oblique intent: {{a person}} has oblique intent when the event is a natural <b>consequence</b> of a {{voluntary}} act and they foresee it as such. The 'natural consequence' definition was replaced in R v Woollin with the 'virtually certain' test. A person is now held to intend a <b>consequence</b> (obliquely) when that <b>consequence</b> is a virtually certain <b>consequence</b> of their action, and they knew {{it to be a}} virtually certain <b>consequence.</b> The first leg of this test has been condemned as unnecessary: a person should be held as intending a <b>consequence</b> if (s)he believed it to be a virtually certain <b>consequence,</b> regardless of whether it was in fact virtually certain.|$|R

40|$|It {{is often}} {{suggested}} that truth-preservation is insufficient for logical <b>consequence,</b> and that <b>consequence</b> needs {{to satisfy a}} further condition of relevance.

Thus logical <b>consequence</b> is the intersection of truth-preservation and relevance...|$|R

In this paper, I make this argument definitive. In doing that, I will provide an indisputable proof that the simple conjunction of the Converse <b>Consequence</b> Condition and the Entailment Condition yields a disastrous <b>consequence...</b>|$|R

5|$|According to Jains, the <b>consequences</b> of karma are inevitable. The <b>consequences</b> {{may take}} some time to take effect but the karma is never fruitless. The latent karma becomes active and bears fruit when the {{supportive}} conditions arise. A great part of attracted karma bears its <b>consequences</b> with minor fleeting effects, as generally most of our activities are influenced by mild negative emotions. However, those actions that are influenced by intense negative emotions cause an equally strong karmic attachment which usually does not bear fruit immediately. It takes on an inactive state and waits for the supportive conditions—like proper time, place, and environment—to arise for it to manifest and produce effects. If the supportive conditions do not arise, the respective karmas will manifest at the end of maximum period for which it can remain bound to the soul. These supportive conditions for activation of latent karmas are determined by the nature of karmas, intensity of emotional engagement at the time of binding karmas and our actual relation to time, place, surroundings. There are certain laws of precedence among the karmas, according to which the fruition of some of the karmas may be deferred but not absolutely barred.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the algebras of <b>consequence</b> operators and finite <b>consequence</b> operators {{on a fixed}} language. Significant new collections of <b>consequence</b> operators are defined and shown to be complete and distributive sublattices. Further, the collection of <b>consequence</b> operators is shown to be almost atomic. Other lattice theoretic properties are investigated and useful chain properties are obtained. In the last section, natural languages, and associated <b>consequence</b> operators, are encoded and embedded into a nonstandard structure. The entire basic theory of nonstandard <b>consequence</b> operators is developed in this last section. Comment: Plain Tex, 11 pages. In this version, an important clarification is made in Remark 4. 6 and one significant statement that applies more directly to Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem is added. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:astro-ph/ 990311...|$|R
