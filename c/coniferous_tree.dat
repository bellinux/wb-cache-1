5|$|A {{number of}} field studies {{conducted}} in the boreal forest region of Northern Ontario (Canada) showed that A.sarcoides {{was found to be}} frequently associated with various deciduous and <b>coniferous</b> <b>tree</b> hosts that had been affected by the fungal disease known as heart rot; this discovery was noted as unusual, as most fungal tree infections are known to be caused by Basidiomycetes, not Ascomycetes. In the case of the commercially valuable tree species black spruce (Picea mariana), it was determined that prior colonization by A.sarcoides reduces the incidence of subsequent infection by common fungal pathogens, such as Fomes pini and Scytinostroma galactina; furthermore, A.sarcoides can exist in the wood with no noticeable harmful effects on the host. A similar relationship was shown later to exist with jack pine trees (species Pinus banksiana), whereby A.sarcoides inhibited Peniophora pseudopini, but had little effect on the subsequent growth of Fomes pini. The study also showed that A.sarcoides is isolated more frequently from defective wood as the age of the tree increases (trees examined in the study were over 80 years old), and that it can infect both uninfected heartwood as well as previously decayed wood; in the latter case it usually coexists with the causal fungi.|$|E

25|$|Wollemia is a genus of <b>coniferous</b> <b>tree</b> in {{the family}} Araucariaceae. Wollemia was only known through fossil records until the Australian species Wollemia nobilis was {{discovered}} in 1994 in a temperate rainforest wilderness area of the Wollemi National Park in New South Wales, in a remote series of narrow, steep-sided sandstone gorges 150km north-west of Sydney. The genus is named for the National Park.|$|E

The oldest boats found by archaeological excavation are dugout canoes dating back to the Neolithic Period around 7,000-9,000 years ago. These canoes were often cut from <b>coniferous</b> <b>tree</b> logs, using simple stone tools. A 7000-year-old seagoing boat made from reeds and tar has been found in Kuwait. These early vessels had limited capability; they could float and move on water, but were not suitable for use any great distance from the shoreline. [...] They were used mainly for fishing and hunting.|$|E

60|$|On the {{following}} morning, {{we crossed the}} Islumbo pass over Singalelah into Sikkim, the elevation being 11,000 feet. Above our camp the trees were few and stunted, and we quickly emerged from the forest on a rocky and grassy ridge, covered with withered Saxifrages, Umbelliferae, Parnassia, Hypericum, etc. There were no pines {{on either side of}} the pass; a very remarkable peculiarity of the damp mountains of Sikkim, which I have elsewhere had occasion to notice: we had left Pinus longifolia (a far from common tree in these valleys) at 3000 feet in the Tawa three days before, and ascended to 11,000 feet without passing a <b>coniferous</b> <b>tree</b> of any kind, except a few yews, at 9000 feet, covered with red berries.|$|E

40|$|The {{relation}} between health condition and aesthetic value of green spaces was studied in Pionirski Park. Mean ratings of these values were compared and analyzed for different plant categories (broadleaf <b>trees,</b> <b>coniferous</b> <b>trees</b> broadleaf shrubs, evergreen shrubs and coniferous shrubs). It {{was concluded that}} in Pionirski Park broadleaf trees have higher aesthetic values than <b>coniferous</b> <b>trees.</b> Total aesthetic value of <b>coniferous</b> <b>trees</b> is {{lower than that of}} broadleaf trees, because the latter are infested by pests and diseases of assimilation organs, which have been present for many years in high degrees of infestation and infection. It was concluded that <b>coniferous</b> <b>trees</b> were significantly degraded thanks to inadequate maintenance, by which their aesthetic value was reduced and their life span significantly shortened. It is extremely important to research the current health condition of green spaces and to determine what reclamation measures are necessary to conserve and enhance its authenticity, cultural-landscape heritage and aesthetic value...|$|R
