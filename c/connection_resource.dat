Many cloud services are available in current commercial solutions, {{but they are not}} suitable for latency, portability and location-sensitive applications, such as IoT, Wearable computing, Smart Grids, Connected Vehicles [5] and Software-Defined-Networks [6]. Latency depends on the speed of Internet <b>connection,</b> <b>resource</b> contention among guest virtual machines (VM) and has been shown to increase with distance [7]. Furthermore, such applications generate large volumes of varied data in a high velocity, and by the time data reaches a cloud system for analysis, the chance to inform the IoT device to take reactive action may be gone. For example, consider IoT devices in the medical domain where the latency of acting on the sensed data could be life-critical.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—BitTorrent is {{a popular}} {{peer-to-peer}} file-sharing protocol that utilizes a central server, known as a “tracker”, to coordinate connections between peers in a “swarm”, a term used to describe a BitTorrent ad-hoc file sharing network. The tracker of a swarm is specified by the original file distributor and trusted unconditionally by peers in the swarm. This central point of control {{provides an opportunity for}} a file distributor to deploy a modified tracker to provide peers in a swarm with malicious coordination data, directing peer connection traffic toward an arbitrary target machine on an arbitrary service port. Although such an attack does not generate huge amount of attack traffic, it would set up many connections with the victim server successfully and hold these connections until time out, which could cause serious denial-of-service by exhausting a server’s <b>connection</b> <b>resource.</b> In this paper, we present such an attack that is entirely tracker-based, requiring no modifications to BitTorrent client software and could be deployed by an attacker right now. The results from both simulation and real-world experiments show the applicability of this attack. Due to the skyrocketing popularity of BitTorrent and numerous large-scale swarms existed in the Internet, BitTorrent swarms provide an intriguing platform for launching distributed denial-of-service attacks based on connection exhaustion.

40|$|Often {{endpoints}} {{are connected}} by multiple paths, but communications are usually restricted {{to a single}} path per <b>connection.</b> <b>Resource</b> usage within the network would be more efficient were it possible for these multiple paths to be used concurrently. Multipath TCP is a proposal to achieve multipath transport in TCP. New congestion control algorithms are needed for multipath transport protocols such as Multipath TCP, as single path algorithms {{have a series of}} issues in the multipath context. One of the prominent problems is that running existing algorithms such as standard TCP independently on each path would give the multipath flow more than its fair share at a bottleneck link traversed by more than one of its subflows. Further, it is desirable that a source with multiple paths available will transfer more traffic using the least congested of the paths, achieving a property called "resource pooling " where a bundle of links effectively behaves like one shared link with bigger capacity. This would increase the overall efficiency of the network and also its robustness to failure. This document presents a congestion control algorithm that couples the congestion control algorithms running on different subflows by linking their increase functions, and dynamically controls the overall aggressiveness of the multipath flow. The result is a practical algorithm that is fair to TCP at bottlenecks while moving traffic away from congested links. Raiciu, et al. Experimental [Page 1...|$|E
