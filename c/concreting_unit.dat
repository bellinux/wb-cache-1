40|$|The {{first house}} {{built in the}} {{prefabricated}} concrete technology was built in 1957 in Jelonki near Warsaw. This method started to develop {{at the end of}} the 60 s and expanded dynamically. In the buildings from <b>concrete</b> <b>units</b> still live about 8 million people. Nowadays this technology is criticized and a question appears: "Is it an optimal habitat to live?" Many people say: "No". I would like to show that houses from the prefabricated <b>concrete</b> <b>units</b> have some advantages too. In my article I try to analyze comprehensively the "quality of life" of the inhabitants of buildings from the prefabricated <b>concrete</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R

30|$|A vermicompost {{station of}} 10 [*]×[*] 8 [*]×[*] 3  m 3 (l[*]×[*]w[*]×[*]h) {{was built in}} a shaded area, {{following}} Ismail (2005). The vermicomposting units were set up at the vermicompost station using the Vermitech Pattern reported by Ismail (2005). <b>Concrete</b> <b>units</b> of 150 [*]×[*] 100 [*]×[*] 60  cm 3 were built as containers for culturing the earthworms.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of using pumice aggregates for concrete in structural applications is discussed.

Reinforced bearing masonry walls, made with the <b>concrete</b> <b>units</b> in question, were manufactured and tests on the panels and on the designed units were carried out.

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, the use of pumice as {{lightweight}} aggregate for concrete in structural applications has been the object of different studies. The aim was {{to find out if}} pumice can be an alternative to ordinary lightweight aggregate. The present paper is framed in this context. Here, a study is presented showing the use of pumice for making lightweight <b>concrete</b> <b>units</b> for masonry members. Through the paper, the formulation of a mix design for lightweight concrete is proposed. Then the obtained mechanical characteristics of the masonry units are discussed and compared to the code requirements. Reinforced bearing masonry walls, made with the <b>concrete</b> masonry <b>units</b> in question, were made and tested under lateral cyclic loads. For comparison, lightweight <b>concrete</b> <b>units</b> and bearing walls made using expanded clay were constructed and tested in order to show if pumice can also be considered as an alternative to ordinary lightweight aggregate in the case discussed here...|$|R
