30|$|Donation {{behavior}} of private business owners is {{the dependent variable}} {{in this study and}} is measured from two aspects: the situation of corporate donations and business owners’ subjective views of donations. Corporate donations are used to characterize business owners’ donations because management of private enterprises is mainly concentrated in the hands of its owners. The survey shows that 82  % of respondents believe that the final decision making on investments and donations is decided by the chairman or general manager; the remainder believes this decision is made by the board. In fact, business owners must {{be a member of the}} board of directors and also often serve as the general manager. Specific measurements of the dependent variable include five proxies: (1) the amount of annual charitable donations; (2) the frequency of donations per year; (3) channels of <b>corporate</b> donations—civil <b>affairs</b> <b>departments,</b> religious organizations, and charities; (4) disclosure of donations; and (5) whether the government has incentives for donation. Of these, the first two objectively reflect the amount and frequency of business owners’ donations, and the latter three reflect the subjective preferences of business owners. We aim to reveal different associations between ideals and interests. This study focuses on the years 2008 and 2009 because natural disasters occurred frequently in China during this period, including the Wenchuan earthquake, and basically, all Chinese people were involved in donations.|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 46). As a part of academic requirement and completion of BBA program, it is needed to complete three month period of Internship program. ROBI Axiata Limited was the organization where internship program was completed. A project named “Planning and designing digital archiving strategy” was assigned to Corporate, Regulatory and Legal affairs (CRL). Under that project of Corporate, Regulatory and Legal affairs (CRL) division, the internship program took place. It was a new thing but {{was an opportunity to}} learn about as much as possible while working on the project. Robi Axiata ltd. is a dynamic and leading countrywide GSM communication solution provider. It is a joint venture company between Axiata Group Berhad, Malaysia and NTT DOCOMO INC, Japan. Axiata Limited, formerly known as Telecom Malaysia International (Bangladesh), commenced its operation in 1997 under the brand name Aktel among the pioneer GSM mobile telecommunications service providers in Bangladesh. Later, on 28 th March 2010 the company started its new journey with the brand name Robi Axiata ltd. This report has presented based on the observations and experiences gathered from the company during internship period. The organization has many divisions and departments but here the focus is given on <b>Corporate</b> <b>Affairs</b> <b>Department</b> of Robi Axiata ltd. This Department organizes different seminars, events and activations to shaping stakeholder’s mindset, safeguarding shareholder’s interest, ensuring sustainable tax regime and ensuring commercial freedom. This report fairly describes what were the responsibilities, contributions and importance on <b>Corporate</b> <b>Affairs</b> <b>department</b> as an intern. The last chapter of the report describes The Advertising Campaign of Robi on Jamdani industry. Robi got an excellent idea to go for an advertising campaign on Jamdani industry, thousands years heritage of Bangladeshi people. The campaign successfully represented the brand, slogan and theme of Robi. This chapter basically showed how advertising campaign has pulled target customers, created a positive impact, exploited inherent drama of the advertisement and maintained Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC) tools.

40|$|The Internet as an {{innovative}} platform housing multiple {{channels of communication}} is {{largely responsible for the}} presence of businesses on the web space. As a result, businesses soon find themselves in a position, not only to feed Internet channels with content but also to manage the content vis-à-vis content on other platforms. In the context of the Nigerian financial services industry, this calls the attention of public relations (PR) practitioners who are positioned in the <b>corporate</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>department</b> to manage the image of the financial institutions they represent. The objective of this study, therefore, was to gain an understanding of the contributions in the literature with respect to the Internet as a communicative tool for businesses. Although the literature has little or no evidence from Nigerian markets, theoretical arguments indicate many uses of the Internet for business communication by PR practitioners resulting in a new communication model proposed by Hoffman & Novak (1996). An attempt to situate these theoretical positions within a local context led the researchers to carry out a pilot study which revealed that there is a gap between internet channels initiated by business and the business objective of opening up such channels. As a result, there is a tendency of such channels t...|$|E

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 55 - 57). This report is based on “Impact of Corporate Social Responsibility on brand equity in context of Citibank, N. A., Bangladesh”. Previous studies have already shown positive relationship between Corporate Social Responsibility and brand equity. But this cannot be generalized for all the organization or industry that is why this research has been conducted. This research has tried to find to out whether Corporate Social Responsibility, competitive advantages of CSR has any impact on brand equity of Citibank N. A. or not. The report has mainly concentrated on Corporate Social Responsibility as independent variable and brand equity as dependent variable. As the <b>Corporate</b> <b>Affairs</b> <b>Department</b> of Citibank N. A. has limited employee, {{so it was not}} possible to take any survey. For this reason this report is prepared on many article researches and as a primary source of information it took interview from Ms. Farah Rahman. It also show some comparison between others MNC’s banks like- SCB and HSBC. At the end of this research it was found that there is a significant relationship between Citi’s Corporate Social Responsibility and Brand Equity and band image of Citibank N.

40|$|Today it is {{generally}} accepted that organisations have social responsibilities that extend well beyond what in the past was commonly referred to simply as the “business economic function”. This study sets out {{to find out the}} motivation of Shell Malaysia (SM) in practicing their CSR initiatives. Understanding that no metaphor is perfect and that the pyramid of CSR by Archie B Carroll is no exception, the four responsibilities: economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic is intended to portray that the total CSR of SM 2 ̆ 7 s business comprising distinct components that, taken together, constitute the whole. Intensive interview was done within the sphere of SM 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Corporate</b> <b>Affairs</b> (CA) <b>Department</b> directed to the senior management. Motivations that lead to CSR initiatives is the earning of goodwill which help SM optimise its portfolio and maintains its license to operate and grow, enhancement of reputation, retention of good employment talent, investor relations and access to capital, reduction and management of project risk through risk profile and risk management, encouragement of innovation inspired by society 2 ̆ 7 s expectations, reinforcement of customer loyalty, and lastly, the gains of eco- efficiency through societal approval that increases overall business efficiency. The studied organisation practices CSR according to the four responsibilities in Carroll 2 ̆ 7 s pyramid: economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic. In spite, having the ethical and philanthropic layers added only recently, SM 2 ̆ 7 s CSR initiatives seemed to have gone beyond that, practicing strategic engagement into the field, which puts it in the lead compared to many organisations.

40|$|Middle {{management}} is on a mission, according to long-time ABC staff member, Terry Lane THE ABC’s punishment of broadcaster Stephen Crittenden for writing an anodyne {{article for the}} Sydney Morning Herald is at least wacky and perhaps even bizarre. What is going on? My guess {{is that it is}} a flexing of muscle by middle management in the <b>corporate</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>department.</b> They are proving that they take seriously the job of controlling ABC staff - or at least some of the staff some of the time. As Gerard Henderson has pointed out in his inimitable way, the Adams and Lane horses have bolted and it is too late to retrospectively rein us in, as it were. But they are determined to see that it doesn’t happen again, and Crittenden is being punished pour encourager les autres. The ABC has always had a clause in its terms of engagement compelling staff to seek permission before undertaking any outside activity. Recently I was told that if I asked for permission to speak at a peace rally (this was being given as a ‘for instance’) permission would be denied. That this is an intolerable restriction on free speech is self-evident. I was once taken to task by a state manager for preaching a sermon in an Anglican church without first seeking permission. When I asked: ‘And what if I had asked and permission had been denied?’ the manager said: ‘Oh for Christ’s sake, Terry, I would always say yes. ’ I took this to be a blanket permission for all future excursions into the pulpit. The only justification for restricting the rights of ABC employees to speak or write in other media or forums is if they intend to speak about matters that are to do with the ABC and could only have been learned by working for the ABC. And even then the rule should be exercised carefully. I have, on a number of occasions, spoken and written for Friends of the ABC. And an organisation that makes heroes of whistle-blowers certainly lives in a glass house. The one other possible justification for restricting the activities of staff is if they are appearing on other, competing, electronic media outlets. But again care needs to be exercised in policing this restriction. A few years ago when I had written an article for the Melbourne Herald to which management took exception I was called in for reproof. In the article I had taken the side of management in a dispute with the Melbourne Symphony orchestra over contracts. I was told that I should not write about the ABC, even favourably. My attention was drawn to the clause in my contract that forbade any outside engagement without managerial approval. I said that I would not accept that restriction on my activities and that if I were not sacked on the spot I would remove the clause from future contracts, which I have done. I have written hundreds, perhaps thousands, of newspaper articles and eight books. I have spoken in hundreds of different forums, sometimes about the ABC, but usually on other subjects. I have even expressed personal opinions which I am sure have made ABC management wince. But I have never been stood down or punished in any way. Indeed, my experience with management, post- 1982, has been almost invariably heartening. I have found all the managers at all levels to be sensible, understanding and supportive. I have come away from tense encounters with various managers thinking that they were a little embarrassed at having to enforce archaic rules of employment. So what is going on in the case of Stephen Crittenden? His harassment must be seen in the context of the times. ABC {{management is}} terrified of the Howard government. It is determined to demonstrate that it is serious about bringing bolshie producers and presenters under control. The ABC has created a stratum of management to handle audience complaints, and in at least one case with which I am painfully familiar, the zealots have turned a mild expression of disapproval from a listener into a major complaint requiring lots of huffing and puffing to demonstrate seriousness of intent. I fear that Stephen is a victim of the new enthusiasm. One of the justifications proposed for reining me in and bringing me under closer management control was that I am a creation of the ABC. Without the corporation I would be a nobody whose opinions would be worthless in the market place of ideas. So, having made me, the ABC owns me and is entitled to control me, even in the days of the week for which the corporation does not pay me. It’s a bit like arguing that the Steinway company makes pianists. The fact of the matter is that we do what we do using the media most appropriate to our capabilities. The ABC is a huge, expensive and complex instrument but that doesn’t give it ownership rights over the people who play on it. Terry Lane presents The National Interest on ABC Radio Nationa...|$|E
