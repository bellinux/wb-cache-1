2500|$|Norton was a forward-pressing fighter/boxer who was {{notable for}} his unusual guard/stance characterised by the <b>cross</b> <b>arm</b> defence. The left arm low across the torso and right hand {{up by the}} right or left ear. But when under heavy {{pressure}} both arms were brought up high across at face level whilst one leant forward. This left the opponent little target in theory. The guard was also used by the legendary Archie Moore. George Foreman later used it very effectively during his famous comeback years. Tim Witherspoon was another practitioner. Joe Frazier even borrowed it for occasions in his third Ali match. The style is named the [...] "cross-armed defense". It tends to look crablike. Norton would bob and weave from a crouch, firing well placed heavy punches. Norton was best when advancing. He'd drag or slide the right foot along from behind. By comparison, most conventional boxers have elbows in at the torso with forearms vertically parallel to each another, the gloves then being both near sides of the face. Most trainers believe the conventional style is a better defense and that the cross-arm style leaves the user open far too often.|$|E

[...] "We'll show {{him that the}} Blue Tortoise Patrol isn't afraid to take a dare from any one, and we'll show him a few stunts to make his Bull Moose {{up there in the}} woods turn green with envy. You're on your mettle now, fellows. We'll go over to the wildest and most lonesome part of the park and divide into two companies. Pat can take one and be the enemy which has made a {{successful}} raid and made its get-away. Hal can go with him because he knows the country as well as any of us. We'll give them ten minutes' start and then go in pursuit. There's enough snow in patches to make snowballs. Any one hit on the arms or legs is wounded. A hit on the throwing arm puts that man out of the fighting, but he is still at liberty. A hit on either leg puts a man out of action, but he may hide if he can within a radius of a hundred feet of the place where he was hit. A hit on the head or any part of the body puts a man wholly out of action and he becomes a first aid man {{to take care of the}} wounded. You fellows have played the game before, and I presume each of you has a Red <b>Cross</b> <b>arm</b> band to pin on when you are hit so that you will be recognized as a non-combatant." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{school bus}} <b>crossing</b> <b>arm</b> is a safety device {{intended}} {{to protect children from}} being struck while crossing in front of a school bus. Typically, school bus <b>crossing</b> <b>arms</b> are wire or plastic devices which extend from the front bumper {{on the right side of}} the bus while it is stopped for loading/unloading and form a barrier. The purpose of the device is that children who need to cross the road will be forced to walk several feet forward of the front of the bus itself before they can begin to cross the road, thus ensuring that the bus driver can see them as they cross in front of the bus, avoiding a common blind spot immediately in front of the bus. The <b>crossing</b> <b>arm</b> retracts flush against the bumper while not activated, such as when the bus is in motion.|$|R
