Background Fracking is the process of recovering natural gas trapped by shale rock by injecting fluids (water, chemicals, proppant) at high pressure into horizontal wells. After a well is fracked, the recovered fluid must be disposed of. Currently, the majority of fracturing companies use open <b>loop</b> <b>systems.</b> The fluid is put into an evaporation pit with the intent of evaporating as much as possible before it is hauled away for processing. Alternatively, {{some parts of the country}} with scarce amounts of water use <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Closed</b> <b>loop</b> <b>systems</b> are essentially fluid holding tanks that hold the water and chemicals until trucked away for processing.
