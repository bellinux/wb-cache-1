50|$|In 2011, twelve horses of the Misaki herd gave {{positive}} <b>Coggins</b> <b>test</b> {{results for}} equine infectious anaemia.

50|$|Picayune Strand State Forest {{offers many}} {{recreational}} opportunities. A 22 mi equestrian trail winds across the Belle Meade Tract from Miller Boulevard to Benfield Road. All horses on the Forest must have current negative <b>Coggins</b> <b>Test</b> results, proof {{of which is}} to be carried by each rider. A primitive equestrian campground equipped with paddocks is located next to the Field Office and trailhead, and an additional oak-shaded primitive campsite is located near the middle of the trail.|$|E
50|$|Another very {{important}} aspect that the IHP addresses {{is linked to}} the challenge of educating horse-owners and the general public on the realities related to equine infectious anemia, a disease that the association considers to be misunderstood and less dangerous than what is generally believed. To this end it started a scientific collaboration with the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Perugia. With the authorization of the competent veterinary AUSL (Local Health Agency) and according to Italian norms, the Italian Horse Protection Association is the only active isolation center in Italy that allows freedom of movement for horses who were found positive to the <b>Coggins</b> <b>test</b> (agar immunodiffusion).|$|E
5000|$|Some {{experts and}} UK {{government}} officials have raised concerns that horse meat from Romania could be contaminated with equine infectious anaemia (EIA). Although EIA does not pose a risk to humans, {{it could be an}} indicator of additional health problems in horses that may stem from poor living conditions. Since 2007, the European Union has restricted export of live horses from Romania to any other EU member state unless the animals have a <b>Coggins</b> <b>test</b> for EIA prior to export. Environment secretary Owen Paterson stated that [...] "Romanian horse meat is not allowed in", though he acknowledged that it could be a serious problem if Romanian horse meat from animals with EIA had been imported.|$|E
5000|$|In 1992, {{a program}} to monitor Equine Infectious Anemia (EIA) was {{initiated}} by the National Stud Farm for all breeding stock. The tests adopted were the <b>Coggins</b> <b>Test</b> (also known as the Agar Gel Immuno-Diffusion (AGID) Test). In 1995, the Blood Typing and Parentage Validation Program was also adopted by the NSF for horses that were under contract with the Royal Western India Turf Club, Inc. (RWITC). In 1996, the Stud Book Authority of the Philippines (SBAP, also known as The Philippine Stud Book Volume I) was recognized by the International Stud Book Committee (ISBC).

40|$|This paper {{consists}} of a brief review on equine Infectious anemia added {{of the results of}} serological diagnosis of this infection performed at the Federal University of Santa Maria, RS, Brazil, between 1979 to 1990. A total of 7, 035 serum samples were tested by the agar gel immunodiffusion test (<b>Coggins</b> <b>test),</b> to which 40 (0, 57 %) reacted positively. This percentage of positivity is lower than in other regions of Brazil, probably {{due to the lack of}} predisposing factors for equine infectious anemia virus spread, such as, a low density of blood-sucking insects in the South of Brazil and the seldom use of massive therapies and vaccinations in the region...|$|E

40|$|Research {{conducted}} in dynamic, in 2005 - 2010 period, regarding {{the incidence of}} outbreaks of equine infectious anemia in  Mures County, on a cumulative total of 925 actual horses from households in the commune and the 2 villages belonging and serologically tested (<b>Coggins</b> <b>test)</b> showed a significant decline in positive serologically diagnosed cases, 20 positive cases in 2005 (10. 9 %) to 3 positive cases in 2010 (0. 25 %). Cumulative distribution of outbreaks of equine infectious anemia in the commune and the 2 villages belonging showed variation, in the commune 16 cases (5. 04 %), in the I village 26 cases (7. 10 %) and in the II village 10 cases (3. 87 %). Assessing responsiveness to equine infectious anemia correlated with sex, in the time reported showed a higher receptivity in males (5. 7 %) than females (5. 5 %). Also was found a higher responsiveness to infectious disease between age group 6 - 10 years (3. 4 %) compared with the age group between 11 - 15 years (2. 1 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Among animal lentiviruses, Feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus (FIV), Equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV) and Small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLV) are important pathogens {{associated with a}} variety of clinical pictures including immunodeficiency, anaemia, arthritis, pneumonia. The detection of viral antibody response represents a practical diagnostic approach in all lentivirus infections since they remain detectable long life. Capsid antigen (CA) is the major viral core protein and specific antibodies against this antigen are usually first recognised in infected sheep, goat and horse, remaining detectable for long period. Transmembrane (TM) domain of envelope glycoprotein contains a well conserved motif known to form an immunadominant epitope in several lentiviruses. In this study a simple strategy was developed to express the entire CA and the TM epitope in a single fusion protein from equine, feline and small ruminant lentiviruses in prokaryotic system and evaluated the diagnostic utility of a purified preparation in an indirect ELISA {{for each of the three}} infections. Results demonstrate that, for FIV and SRLV infections, the combination of CA and TM fractions increases the sensitivity of diagnostic tests based only on CA. The corresponding CA/TM antigen from EIAV showed excellent agreement with <b>Coggins</b> <b>test.</b> (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
