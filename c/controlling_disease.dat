40|$|Although {{acromegaly}} {{is a rare}} disease, the clinical, {{economic and}} health-related quality of life (HRQoL) burden is considerable due to the broad spectrum of comorbidities {{as well as the}} need for lifelong management. We performed a comprehensive literature review of the past 12  years (1998 – 2010) to determine the benefit of <b>disease</b> <b>control</b> (defined as a growth hormone [GH] concentration < 2. 5  μg/l and insulin-like growth factor [IGF]- 1 normal for age) on clinical, HRQoL, and economic outcomes. Increased GH and IGF- 1 levels and low frequency of somatostatin analogue use directly predicted increased mortality risk. Clinical outcome measures that may improve with <b>disease</b> <b>control</b> include joint articular cartilage thickness, vertebral fractures, left ventricular function, exercise capacity and endurance, lipid profile, and obstructive apnea events. Some evidence suggests an association between <b>controlled</b> <b>disease</b> and improved HRQoL.
