Additionally, weldability is improved since a maximum <b>carbon</b> <b>equivalent</b> value of 0.45 (0.47 for Group 4 and 5 shapes) is required. ASTM A992 is written to cover all hot-rolled shapes." ...|$|E
5000|$|Wet {{underwater}} welding directly {{exposes the}} diver and electrode {{to the water}} and surrounding elements. [...] Divers usually use around 300-400 amps of direct current to power their electrode, and they weld using varied forms of arc welding. This practice commonly uses a variation of shielded metal arc welding, employing a waterproof electrode. Other processes that are used include flux-cored arc welding and friction welding. In each of these cases, the welding power supply {{is connected to the}} welding equipment through cables and hoses. The process is generally limited to low <b>carbon</b> <b>equivalent</b> steels, especially at greater depths, because of hydrogen-caused cracking.|$|E
50|$|Improving {{the local}} {{environment}} and overall sustainability of your community For every three {{square feet of}} deconstruction, enough lumber can be salvaged to build one square foot of new construction. At this rate, if deconstruction replaced residential demolition, the United States could generate enough recovered wood to construct 120,000 new affordable homes each year. The deconstruction of a typical 2,000 sq ft wood frame home can yield 6,000 board feet of reusable lumber. Every year the United States buries about 33 million tons of wood-related construction and demolition debris in landfills.

5000|$|In the United States, {{the most}} {{commonly}} used classification for gray iron is ASTM International standard A48.

Higher strength gray irons, up to class 40, have lower carbon equivalents and a pearlite matrix. Gray iron above class 40 requires alloying to provide solid solution strengthening, and heat treating is used to modify the matrix. Class 80 is the highest class available, but it is extremely brittle. ASTM A247 is also commonly used to describe the graphite structure. Other ASTM standards that deal with gray iron include ASTM A126, ASTM A278, and ASTM A319.|$|E

The <b>carbon</b> <b>equivalent</b> level correlates with weldability; the lower the Ceqv, the better the weldability.|$|E
40|$|It is {{virtually}} impossible to produce castings free from internal stresses using conventional methods of founding. Castings with appreciable stresses distort during storage, transportation, machining and service. Though composition and melt treatment are known to affect the magnitude of residual stress in castings, the data on the effect of <b>carbon</b> <b>equivalent</b> and inoculation on the magnitude of residual stress in castings are limited. In the present investigation, an attempt is made to study (i) the effect of <b>carbon</b> <b>equivalent</b> on residual stress in cast iron castings, and (ii) the effect of inoculants such as calcium silicide and ferrosilicon on residual stress in iron castings in the <b>carbon</b> <b>equivalent</b> range 3. 0 – 4. 0 %. The results of the investigation indicate the following: (i) the residual strains decrease linearly with increase in <b>carbon</b> <b>equivalent</b> in the uninoculated and inoculated irons; (ii) the tensile residual stresses decrease linearly with increase in <b>carbon</b> <b>equivalent</b> value of the uninoculated, calcium silicide-inoculated and ferrosilicon-inoculated cast iron castings; (iii) the ratio of UTS to residual stress increased on inoculating the grid castings. This increase is higher for calcium silicide-inoculated grids than for ferrosilicon-inoculated grid castings. This implies that from the residual stress point of view, inoculation of the iron with calcium silicide is beneficial...|$|E
