40|$|Initially DNA {{paternity}} {{tests were}} government policy driven tests to identify biological fathers for child support purposes. It {{was not a}} straightforward market though, as government agencies did not buy the tests; rather, they delivered customers to the providers. These consumers were both men and women. It follows that the early markets for testing were quite narrowly focused. In the last decade however, commercially marketed tests have attracted widespread public interest and tapped into a range of different markets. The process of market development was initially serendipitous, driven by the coincidence of interests of industry entrepreneurs and men’s rights activists. This paper briefly traces {{the development of a}} market for genetic paternity testing in the Australian context. Drawing from empirical work, it then profiles the various consumers of paternity tests, discussing their reasons for testing, the type of testing (whether the test was accredited or not), {{the extent to which the}} test was instigated by them or by someone else and what were the typical outcomes of testing for each <b>consumer</b> <b>category...</b>|$|E
40|$|Factors and {{constraints}} affecting wine purchasing decisions are numerous, since wine is extraordinarily rich in both intrinsic and extrinsic attributes, material and immaterial characteristics, {{as well as}} functional and symbolic traits which influence the quality perceived by consumers. These conditions reflect themselves in the complexity of consumer purchasing behaviour for wine. The paper aims to investigate the purchasing behaviour for wine of Italian students, whose age is comprised between 19 and 29 years. The study postulates that, even if wine belongs to the country culture heritage and represents an inherent element of people life, young consumers are quite confused about it and a cognitive mismatch reduces the probability of wine purchase within this <b>consumer</b> <b>category.</b> The survey highlights that the “cognitive complexity” of wine prevents young consumers from buying and drinking wine compared with other “easier” alcoholic beverage, such as beer. The results suggest that wine producers and marketers should invest more in the “cognitive simplification” of the product to convey young consumer preferences toward wine, and eventually increase sales...|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, {{the impact}} of section 22 of the Consumer Protection Act, 68 of 2008 on the {{drafting}} of contracts in South Africa is investigated. It was shown {{that there has been}} a great shift internationally to the drafting of consumer documents in plain language. Some jurisdictions even have statutory guidelines for drafting in plain language. The benefits of drafting in plain language were also mentioned. The South African plain language drafting situation is quite unique, with the question of what the characteristics of an ordinary consumer are, posing to be the most important question in determining specific plain language guidelines for South African consumers. It was found that there are potentially more than one type of ordinary consumer, depending on the type of commercial transaction being entered into. Although no statutory plain language drafting guidelines have been published in South Africa, it was suggested that our common law rules of interpretation are a valuable starting point when looking for guidelines for better drafting. This dissertation concludes that two sets of guidelines be developed for at least two levels of commercial transactions. Firstly, the international guidelines of Kimble should be incorporated into our law for consumer contracts relating to more complex consumer transactions. Secondly, another set of guidelines relating to the use of illustrations, examples, headings or other aids to reading and understanding, as envisioned by the CPA, should be developed for use in everyday consumer contracts where the typical consumer is illiterate or falls into the so called vulnerable <b>consumer</b> <b>category.</b> Mini Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} determinants {{and role of}} consumer trust in e-business. It examines consumer perceptions of trust in a Web site and addresses the following key research questions: What factors influence consumer trust in a Web site and what specific Web site trust cues are associated with these factors? How does trust affect consumer behavioral intent on a Web site? To address these questions, we develop a conceptual model that links consumer perceptions of Web site characteristics, consumer characteristics and demographics to perceptions of trust in a Web site, and trust to behavioral intent related to a Web site. We also examine whether trust mediates the relationship between Web site and consumer characteristics and behavioral intent related to the Web site. We test our hypotheses in a large-scale empirical study that estimates this model from 6831 consumers across 25 Web sites and eight industry categories. We validate the model using a holdout sample. The results show that Web site, <b>consumer,</b> <b>category</b> and demographic variables can explain 76 % {{of the variance in}} trust. Web site characteristics such as privacy and security, navigation, presentation, brand, and advice account for as much as 98 % of this explained variance in Web site trust. Surprisingly, over 80 % of the explained variance in Web trust is due to factors other than privacy and security-mainly navigation, brand, advice, absence of errors, and presentation. We also find that trust mediates the relationships between Web site and consumer characteristics and behavioral intent related to Web sites. The results offer important implications for Web site strategies that include the manipulation of factors influencing Web site trust to favorably impact consumer behavior at the Web sit...|$|E
40|$|Objective – This study {{attempts}} to gain knowledge about consumer attitude towards organic clothing and organic clothing stores (retailers) {{and to see}} whether there is any potential this might have for young entrepreneurs. Here {{we have tried to}} evaluate the current state of consumer awareness and knowledge in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach -The survey was conducted using mall-intercept personal survey whereby potential respondents were approached and were requested to fill up the likert-based questionnaire. The questionnaire was designed especially to elicit consumers’ buying pattern and their views on organic clothes. Consumers were asked open frame questions on their agreements and disagreements. Reliability tests were conducted to check the internal consistency of measurement items and the Cronbach’s alpha was calculated to show that there was high correlation between the items. Pearson correlation tests were also used to examine the individual relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable (intention to buy organic clothes), and subsequently Multiple Linear regression (MLR) tests using stepwise regression method were conducted to find which determinants could explain the intention to purchase organic clothes. This is just a basic research done regarding consumer’s attitude and awareness towards organic clothing and how it enhances the growing market for Small and Medium Enterprises. The local eco-entrepreneurs also find taking up a social responsibility to create awareness and encourage consumers to buy ecofriendly products. Findings – The data obtained from the survey were analyzed using Demographic Analysis of respondents, Chi-Square, ANOVA and Correlation Analysis to examine possible results that brings to the understanding of consumer knowledge, belief, perceptions and willingness to purchase and wear organic clothes. Research Limitations – the sample was restricted to a single geographic area in Malaysia and further the number of respondents may not portray the population responses with regard to organic clothes consumption. Practical implications – As Malaysians become more concerned about environment, the green <b>consumer</b> <b>category</b> will continue to grow. It is important for businesses to recognize this phenomenon and capitalize on the emerging market for environment friendly goods and services. Green Entrepreneur promotes the welfare of local people, hence he can be re-designated as Social Entrepreneu...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} girls 2 ̆ 7 series fiction {{played a key}} role in the cultural discourse about girlhood from the late nineteenth century through the early twentieth century. Over the course of sixty-five years, the desirability of piety and community activism for girls slowly shifted to an emphasis on the empowering possibilities of responsible consumption. Chapter One (the introduction) discusses the difficulty of defining adolescence in the postbellum period and its slow evolution into a distinct life phase and <b>consumer</b> <b>category.</b> Chapter Two examines the ways in which reading and religion were intertwined for girls and how the depictions of postbellum benevolence and reform organizations offered girls a path to personal agency that still fell within 2 ̆ 2 acceptable 2 ̆ 2 social behavior. Chapter Three examines the Little Women, Elsie Dinsmore, and Chautauqua Girls series and argues that postbellum series modeled a proto-New Womanhood that was based first on individual acts of charity, next on overlapping networks of benevolence and reform societies, and finally on political and social reform organizations that aimed to create national change. Series heroines take advantage of ix their social status as pious individuals to assist the poor in their communities and to extend their moral reach. ^ Chapter Four begins to detail the shift from postbellum activism to consumerism as the prevalent ideology for girls by examining Edward Stratemeyer‘s innovations in the series book market. Stratemeyer combined the traditional series format with production techniques borrowed from story paper and dime novel publishers. He was also one of the first to recognize adolescents as a distinct market group with money to spend. Finally, Chapter Five examines the Patty Fairfield, Grace Harlowe, and Outdoor Girls series for the ways in which they communicate both excitement and anxiety about the new culture of consumption. Girl heroines exercise agency as consumers and develop individuality through their purchases, gaining a considerable amount of individual autonomy while they lose some of their status as spiritual leaders. Girl heroines learn to be responsible consumers and enjoy the pleasures of individual consumption, but series authors also warn against desiring money and material goods simply for their own sake. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – Three main {{objectives}} are defined in this thesis: 1) To {{determine the extent}} to which the nature of a consideration set affects consumer choice; 2) To investigate how consumer attitudes, knowledge, and convenience motivations affect the formation of a consideration set; and 3) To investigate how category presentation moderates the relationship between convenience motivations and consideration set composition. Design/methodology/approach – Different research designs, several data sources, and different analytical procedures are employed in four papers. Papers # 1, # 2, and # 3 use survey designs and are based on two large (n > 1000) cross-sectional datasets. Data in these papers are analyzed using structural equation modeling in LISREL 8. 72. Paper # 4 is based on two laboratory experiments (n = 150) with 2 × 2 between-subject factorial designs. Data in Paper # 4 are analyzed using a two-way ANOVA in SPSS. Findings and contribution – This dissertation shows that consideration set size is important in explaining a consumer's choice and consumption of food, and is influenced by individual consumer variables such as attitude, knowledge, perceived inconvenience, and convenience orientation. Procedural knowledge is shown to be especially important for the number of food alternatives considered. In addition, the research in this dissertation demonstrates how situational and occasional factors such as availability and the urge to save time or effort (convenience) can affect aspects of consideration set attributes: stability, variety, and size. Importantly, the studies in this dissertation show that these relationships are moderated by the ways food is presented to the <b>consumer</b> (<b>category</b> presentation). While the overall findings are in accordance with previous research on consideration sets, this dissertation builds on and extends the past research by exploring the relationship between convenience and consideration set characteristics. The moderating influence of category presentation on the relationship between convenience motivations and consideration set characteristics is an especially important contribution of this dissertation research. Practical implications – Because the likelihood of being chosen is affected by the size of the consideration set, food producers should advocate that consumers should consider preparing their products in as many ways and in as many combinations with side ingredients as is reasonable. Furthermore, food marketers should focus on activities that enhance the consumer’s direct product experience through testing, trials, tasting, and samples, since procedural knowledge is shown to be of major importance for the number of considered alternatives. If marketers can identify cut-off values of salient attributes such as the time and effort spent on dinner preparation for a particular segment, they will have the ability to position products in accordance with these factors and thereby enhance the possibility of being considered. Furthermore, the moderating effect of category presentation on the relationship between the urge to save time and consideration set (stability, variety, and size) has several practical implications for marketing issues, such as advertising, placement in the retail store, shelf labeling, product development, and package labeling. Research limitations – A limitation of this study is that the relationship between the consideration set and choice was only tested for size dimensions of the consideration set. Future research may focus on the relationship between all the different dimensions of the consideration set (stability, variety, preference dispersion, and size) and choice, at both taxonomic and script category level. In addition, in future research the relationship between knowledge and consideration set (stability, variety, and preference dispersion) should be investigated, because of the close relationship between knowledge and consideration set size shown in this dissertation. Finally, the moderating effect of category presentation is one of the major contributions of this dissertation. These findings should be validated in similar and alternative empirical settings and designs in future research. Originality/value – The findings of this dissertation are in accordance with previous research in the field. The findings also have implications for future theory development and research, as well as practical implications and benefits for the marketing strategy decisions of producers and businesses...|$|E
40|$|Background: Much {{research}} has focused on the prescribing habits of physicians. The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) created a database of research on drug prescribing called Rx for Change. This database focuses both on interventions directed to professionals as well as interventions directed to consumers in relation to evidence-based prescribing/ drug use. The consumer arm of the Rx for Change database has been created and maintained by the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group (CC 2 ̆ 6 CRG, Australia). The database was first populated in 2006 with Cochrane and DARE (Database of Abstracts and Reviews of Effects) systematic review articles collected after standard literature searches as well as extensive hand-searching of both databases. This database was scheduled for an update in 2008. An important question that arises is whether the new reviews screened and identified broaden the scope of the field and expand the definition of evidence-based prescribing for and drug use by consumers. Objectives: This study sought to identify new reviews appropriate for addition to the CADTH Rx for Change database. Following this, the body of new literature was assessed for scope and contribution to the field. Methods: A search was performed by hand of the Cochrane Library from Issue 3, 2006 until the present—Issue 1, 2008. Criteria developed by the CC 2 ̆ 6 CRG during the initial population of the database were used to identify and to sort reviews relevant to prescribing and drug use, a task performed independently by two researchers, with any discrepancies in selection discussed. A third researcher was available to resolve disputes where these arose. Detailed data was extracted from each high and moderate relevance review identified, and the data was summarized in a format acceptable for input into the Rx for Change database. Data extracted included detailed descriptions of the interventions evaluated by each review. The quality of each review was assessed using the AMSTAR tool. Statistical and methodological data were re-expressed as absolute risk differences or in standard narrative formats where suitable numerical data was not available. The themes of the relevant reviews were mapped to a consumer intervention taxonomy developed by the CC 2 ̆ 6 CRG, in order to begin to organize the evidence relating to consumer prescribing/ drug use. A consumer outcome taxonomy for prescribing and drug use was also adapted from the outcome taxonomy developed by the CC 2 ̆ 6 CRG and utilized in data extraction in order to standardize the language used in this field. Finally, the effectiveness of the intervention under study was mapped to standardized effectiveness statements also developed by the CC 2 ̆ 6 CRG. The number of new reviews was quantified and the scope of the new data now included in the database was evaluated and compared to the pool of data originally included in the database in 2006. Results: After screening several hundred reviews, five new Cochrane reviews published in the period between Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2006 and Issue 1, 2008 inclusive were deemed to be high relevance for the Rx for Change database. However, two of these had significant errors requiring clarification by the authors and are therefore excluded from this analysis. A further five reviews were graded as moderate relevance and eleven were low or very low relevance. This is a total of 21 new Cochrane reviews for inclusion in the <b>consumer</b> <b>category</b> of the Rx for Change database. Conclusions: The field of evidence-based prescribing for and drug use by consumers has continued to be an area of growth in new research. Several new highly relevant Cochrane systematic reviews have been published between 2006 and 2008 that expand the populations and diagnoses specifically covered in the Rx for Change database. In addition, they add to and expand the literature that looks at consumers as decision-makers rather than merely recipients of medical interventions. The consumer intervention taxonomy developed by the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group has been used to help establish a framework for the field and allows accurate assessment of the gaps and advances in the literature. This is an exciting and highly relevant field in the climate of patient autonomy and evidence-based medicine, and both the literature and the Rx for Change database will continue to grow...|$|E
