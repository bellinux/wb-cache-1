To accelerate and optimize I/O polling, I/O data can be updated asynchronously to evaluations of control algorithms. If a control program was written with the assumption of synchronous I/O updates, its adaptation to asynchronous I/O updates requires its partial modifications to exclude possibility of dataraces. The simplest and robust way represents simulating of synchronous I/O updates by copying all input values into an array before each evaluation of the program, but such spare buffering generally increases responses to events.

40|$|My {{thesis is}} {{to design a}} <b>Controlled</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Network</b> (CAN) {{simulator}} For Microsoft Windows. In a modern world we deal with complex mechanical systems that require special electronic control to guarantee ultimate safety and efficiency. These electronic control systems are responsible for monitoring subsystems within the mechanical systems. A {{good example of this}} is the motor vehicles that are being driven on the road today. These vehicles have been designed with increased safety and efficiency, such as electronic controlled anti lock breaks, fuel injection, and power control steering. To run all of these components, the car needs a very well designed protocol to be able to control series of messages being passed from one subsystem to another. To determine which message being passed has higher priority than any other messages. To deal with such circumstances, the <b>Controlled</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Network</b> (CAN) was designed. The purpose of the CAN simulator is to gather statistical information concerning the arbitration, message transfer, error detection, error signaling, and retransmision. The CAN simulating model will consist of one to sixty nodes. Each node is considered as a subsystem for the CAN simulator. The subsystems will be characterized as the breaks, engine, transmission, or any part of a car which needs to be connected to the CAN system. Each node will send one to ten messages through the CAN system. The CAN system will take the messages from the nodes and place them into an Arrival queue. Each node will have its own Arrival queue, and no nodes can have two messages on the bus at the same time. The messages will be sorted in the queues in the order of the time needed to be released onto the bus. There will be an internal clock that will monitor the time for when the messages are needed to be placed onto the bus. If there is a situation where two messages need to be sent at the same time, the arbitrator will determine the priority of the messages to be placed onto the bus. Once the message is on the bus, it will go to a transfer queue. Periodically, there will be an error signal sent with the message that will be detected by the error detection, and it will be required that the message to be retransmitted. At critical points on the simulation, statistical information will be gathered for an analyzation. Some examples of information to be analyzed are 1) verification of the simulation performance on a single node with a single message, 2) network load which is a rate of a utilized bus time to the total bus time, 3) network throughput which is a total number of messages that are transmitted per second, and 4) average response time which will be the average time taken by all messages to gain bus access.

WCAN uses token frame method to provide channel access to the nodes in the system.

This method provides high throughput in bounded latency environment, consistent and predictable delays and good packet delivery ratio. The most important factor to consider when evaluating a control network is the end-to-end time delay between sensors, controllers, and actuators. The correct operation of a control system depends on the timeliness of the data coming over the network, and thus, a control network should be able to guarantee message delivery within a bounded transmission time.
