40|$|AbstractThe hot and arid {{lowlands}} {{of southwestern}} Saudi Arabia {{are home to}} two common lianas, Cocculus pendulus and Leptadenia arborea. This paper attempts to relate the adaptation of these two climbing woody perennials to such a harsh environment to the anatomy and hydraulic characteristics of their wood. The stems of these lianas have wood with wide xylem vessels and high hydraulic conductivity which should enhance water flow to the upper canopy despite their severe twisting. Hydraulic conductivity is further helped by the simple perforation plates of xylem vessels. The circular thickening of xylem walls gives them strength and {{reduces the risk of}} their collapse and the ensuing embolism in the advent of high tension created by severe water deficit and high evapo-transpiration demand. Wide vessels, on the other hand, are more susceptible to embolism. This problem may be overcome by reducing the solute potential of xylem sap by hydrolysis of starch grains which were found to be abundant {{in the vicinity of the}} vessels. This should help absorb water by the deep roots from the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringes</b> of the typically shallow water table in this particular habitat. Furthermore, the abundance of ray parenchyma cells between xylem groups of both lianas provides great flexibility with minimum damage to water conduits in the stem during climbing and twisted growth. It was concluded that these wood features in both lianas are crucial for survival under the harsh conditions of arid Tihama plains of southwestern Saudi Arabia...|$|R

A similar defect was observed in Notch 2 β-geo/+Notch 3 β-geo/β-geo compound mutant mice but not in Notch 2 β-geo/+ or Notch 3 β-geo/β-geo single mutants. Finally, to directly test {{for the role of}} Notch signaling in myofibroblast differentiation in vivo, we used ROSA 26 -rtTA/+;tetO-CRE/+;RBPJκflox/flox inducible mutant mice to show that disruption of canonical Notch signaling during late embryonic development prevents induction of smooth muscle actin in mesenchymal cells of the distal lung.

50|$|The <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> is the {{subsurface}} {{layer in}} which groundwater seeps {{up from a}} water table by capillary action to fill pores. Pores {{at the base of}} the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> are filled with water due to tension saturation. This saturated portion of the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> is less than total capillary rise because of the presence of a mix in pore size. If pore size is small and relatively uniform, it is possible that soils can be completely saturated with water for several feet above the water table. Alternately, the saturated portion will extend only a few inches above the water table when pore size is large. Capillary action supports a vadose zone above the saturated base within which water content decreases with distance above the water table. In soils with a wide range in pore size, the unsaturated zone can be several times thicker than the saturated zone.|$|E

50|$|Dual-phase vacuum {{extraction}} (DPVE), {{also known}} as multi-phase extraction, is a technology that uses a high-vacuum system to remove both contaminated groundwater and soil vapor. In DPVE systems, a high-vacuum extraction well is installed with its screened section in the zone of contaminated soils and groundwater. Fluid/vapor extraction systems depress the water table and water flows faster to the extraction well. DPVE removes contaminants from {{above and below the}} water table. As the water table around the well is lowered from pumping, unsaturated soil is exposed. This area, called the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe,</b> is often highly contaminated, as it holds undissolved chemicals, chemicals that are lighter than water, and vapors that have escaped from the dissolved groundwater below. Contaminants in the newly exposed zone can be removed by vapor extraction. Once above ground, the extracted vapors and liquid-phase organics and groundwater are separated and treated. Use of dual-phase vacuum extraction with these technologies can shorten the cleanup time at a site, because the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> is often the most contaminated area.|$|E

In the aquifer, groundwater flows from points of higher pressure to points of lower pressure, and the direction of groundwater flow typically has both a horizontal and a vertical component. The slope of {{the water table}} {{is known as the}} hydraulic gradient, which depends on the rate at which water is added to and removed from the aquifer and the permeability of the material.

5000|$|The {{interception}} {{of precipitation}} {{from the atmosphere}} by the canopy is modeled using the Rutter Interception Model. The land surface evaporation and vegetation transpiration are computed separately using the Two Source Model of Shuttleworth and Gurney, {{which is based on}} the energy balance above canopy, within canopy and at soil surface. This model solves the non-linear equations based on the energy balance for the canopy, surface, and air temperatures at canopy height, evaporation from soil surface and transpiration from vegetation. A soil profile of three homogeneous layers (active, transmission and saturated layers) is used to model the soil moisture on the basis of water balance between layers. The active layer is 15-30 cm thick and it simulates the rapid changes of soil moisture content under high frequency atmospheric forcing. The transmission zone lies between the base of the active layer and the top of the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> and so it more characterizes the seasonal (instead of transient) changes of soil moisture. In modeling the unsaturated flow component of soil water, the water transport is assumed vertical and non-interactive between sub-basins. The lower boundary of the unsaturated zone is the top of <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> controlled by the local average ground water table derived from the catchment average water table and topographic soil index which include the spatial variability of the topographic and soil parameters. Starting with an observed value from the surrounding wells of the modeled basin, the temporal changes in the average ground water depth is based on the water balance analysis for the whole catchment, and the rate of change of the average ground water table is assumed to be the rate of change of local water table.|$|E

Phreatophytes are not only characteristic of arid or desert zones, but also of wetlands, floodplains, depressions that hold water and estuaries. In the wetlands, ecological classification does not provide a special classification, since in this case, most of the plants in the regions of high rainfall can deepen their roots {{to the top of the}} <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> immediately above the water table, and function well as a phreatophyte. In this case they receive the label of mesophytic. Phreatophytic artificial extensions, manmade, are used as a method to purify greywater.|$|E
50|$|Bioslurping {{combines}} {{elements of}} bioventing and vacuum-enhanced pumping of free-product that is lighter than water (light non-aqueous phase liquid or LNAPL) to recover free-product from the groundwater and soil, and to bioremediate soils.

Much like a straw {{in a glass}} draws liquid, the pump draws liquid (including free-product) and soil gas up the tube in the same process stream. Pumping lifts LNAPLs, such as oil, {{off the top of}} the water table and from the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> (i.e., an area just above the saturated zone, where water is held in place by capillary forces). The LNAPL is brought to the surface, where it is separated from water and air.

50|$|Soil {{salination}} is {{the accumulation}} of free salts {{to such an extent}} that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage.|$|E

40|$|Groundwater {{flow in the}} <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> {{is rarely}} {{measured}} during hydrogeological studies because of the difficulties associated with investigating this region. Previous research using a point velocity probe (PVP) to investigate groundwater velocity below the water table suggested that the PVP may also be capable of measuring groundwater velocity within the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe.</b> The earlier PVP was redesigned for this study to allow for groundwater velocity data to be collected remotely. Using this system, groundwater velocity in the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> was investigated under field and laboratory conditions. Field experiments to investigate horizontal flow in the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> were conducted either by collecting vertical velocity profiles across the water table, or by holding the probe stationary and allowing seasonal recharge to move the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> and water table past the probe. Laboratory experiments were conducted in a controlled flow tank that simulated regions of an aquifer up to 85 cm above the water table. The redesigned PVP performed well as a remote system and provided velocity measurements up to 12 cm above the water table under field conditions. These values were consistent with those measured below the water table. In the laboratory, under conditions of drainage, groundwater velocity measurements in the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> consistent with values below the water table were measured up to 44 cm above the water table. The ability to measure horizontal flow of groundwater in the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> may open up new avenues for research {{in the study of}} contaminant transport in phreatic aquifers...|$|E
40|$|Five {{laboratory}} experiments {{were conducted to}} study solute transport in the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> in a sand filled glass tank containing an artificial groundwater zone, an unsaturated zone, and a <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> in between. Dye stained water, applied at the soil surface, moved downwards through the unsaturated zone and then horizontally in the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe.</b> The horizontal velocity of the dye plume front was calculated using optical image analysis and Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) measurements. Both methods gave similar velocities if an appropriate value of the threshold ratio describing the dye front was used. The hydraulic model HYDRUS- 2 D was used to simulate dye movement in the glass tank. After calibrating the dispersivity value in the hydraulic model the horizontal velocity {{was found to be}} in the range - 10 to + 17 % compared to the values measured using image analysis and - 12 to + 24 % compared to the values measured by ERT, the differences could probably be attributed to uncertainties in the hydraulic parameters and soil heterogeneities. Both experimental and numerical results showed that the horizontal velocity of the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> is more or less identical to the one in the saturated zone.

Matric potential values are determined through the use of the van Genuchten soil water characteristic curves, where each soil has its own curve. Additionally, the maximum depth of the groundwater table was studied. The maximum depth was determined based on the rooting depth of the plant species and the height of the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> water at the plant wilting point. Since no acceptable calculation for <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> height at plant wilting could be found in the literature, my own technique is presented here.

Only in one of two experiments could the observed pressure head pattern be satisfactorily reproduced by a steady-state model assuming uniform induction zone properties and uniform infiltration. Later, fingers emerged below the pressure head minima. The induction zone did not affect finger properties. The pressure head in the induction zone was determined by the depth of the finger tips. The water requirement of the fingers dictated the lateral pressure head gradients.

40|$|Dissolved organic {{contaminants}} that {{decrease the}} surface tension of water (surfactants) {{can have an}} effect on unsaturated flow through porous media due to the dependence of capillary pressure on surface tension. One and two-dimensional (1 D, 2 D) laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to study surfactant-induced unsaturated flow. The 1 D experiments investigated differences in surfactant-induced flow as a function of contaminant mobility. The flow in a system contaminated with a high solubility, mobile surfactant, butanol, was much different than in a system contaminated with a sparingly soluble, relatively immobile surfactant, myristyl alcohol (MA). Because surface tension depression caused by MA was confined to the original source zone, the MA system was modeled using a standard unsaturated flow model (HYDRUS- 1 D) by assigning separate sets of hydraulic functions to the initially clean and source zones. To simulate the butanol system, HYDRUS- 1 D was modified to incorporate surfactant concentration-dependent changes to the moisture content-pressure head and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions. Following the 1 D study, a two-dimensional flow cell (2. 4 x 1. 5 x 0. 1 m) was used to investigate the infiltration of a surfactant contaminant plume from a point source on the soil surface, through the vadose zone, and toward a shallow aquifer. Above the top of the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> the advance of the surfactant solution caused a drainage front that radiated from the point source. Upon reaching the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe,</b> the drainage front caused a localized depression of the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> and eventually a new <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> height was established. Horizontal transport of surfactant in the depressed <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> caused the propagation of a wedge-shaped drainage front in the downgradient direction. The numerical model HYDRUS- 2 D was modified to account for surfactant concentration-dependent effects on the unsaturated hydraulic functions and was successfully used to simulate the surfactant infiltration experiment. The extensive propagation of the drying front and the effect of vadose zone drainage on contaminant breakthrough time demonstrate the potential importance of considering surface tension effects on unsaturated flow and transport in systems containing surface-active organic contaminants or in systems where surfactants are used for remediation of the vadose zone or unconfined aquifers...|$|E

Experimental data indicated that at moderate groundwater velocities (0. 1 m/d), vertical mechanical dispersion was negligible and molecular diffusion was the dominant vertical transport mechanism. Under these conditions, TCE concentrations decreased nearly 3 orders of magnitude across the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> and soil gas concentrations remained low relative to those of underlying groundwater. Data collected during a water table drop showed a short-term increase in concentrations throughout most of the unsaturated zone, but these concentrations quickly declined and approached initial values after the water table was returned to its original evel. In the deep part of the unsaturated zone, the water table drop resulted in a long-term decrease in concentrations, illustrating the effects of hysteresis in the soil moisture profile. A two-dimensional random walk advection-diffusion model was developed to simulate the experimental conditions, and numerical simulations agreed well with experimental data. A simpler, one-dimensional finite-difference diffusion-dispersion model was also developed. One-dimensional simulations based on molecular diffusion also agreed well with experimental data. Simulations which incorporated mechanical dispersion tended to overestimate flux across the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe.</b> Good agreement between the one- and two-dimensional models suggested that a simple, one-dimensional approximation of vertical transport across the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> can be useful when conditions are appropriate...|$|E

Current literature suggests that the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(Ill) through in situ redox manipulation {{in the presence of a}} reductant is an innovative technique for remediating chromate-contaminated sediments and ground water. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of sodium dithionite in creating a reductive environment to remediate Cr(VI) present in soil. Sodium dithionite, a strong reductant, was injected into a small area of the vadose zone where elevated Cr(VI) was identified. Several striking changes observed in the target zone during the post-injection monitoring periods include a significant decrease in Eh(SHE), as much as ~ 700 m V, absence of dissolved oxygen for 48 weeks, and the increase of Fe(II) concentrations. Results indicated that the in situ remedial treatment of Cr(VI) in the <b>capillary</b> <b>fringe</b> area was effective and consequently the concentration of Cr(VI) in ground water dropped below the MCLG level. This research demonstrated the effectiveness of in situ abiotic remediation by reducing Cr(VI) concentrations, mobility, and toxicity in soils and ground water within a short period of time. Therefore, sodium dithionite would be a feasible and cost-effective option for a full-scale remedial approach for the contaminated site at the U. S. Coast Guard Facility...|$|E
