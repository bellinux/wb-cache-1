To devise a multi-acquisition <b>coil</b> <b>compression</b> technique for improved computational efficiency. Methods: The bSSFP image for a given coil and acquisition is modeled to be modulated by a coil sensitivity and a bSSFP profile. The proposed reconstruction by calibration over tensors (ReCat) recovers missing data by tensor interpolation over the coil and acquisition dimensions. <b>Coil</b> <b>compression</b> is achieved using a new method based on multilinear singular value decomposition (MLCC). ReCat is compared with iterative self-consistent parallel imaging (SPIRiT) and profile encoding (PE-SSFP) reconstructions. Results: Compared to parallel imaging or profile-encoding methods, ReCat attains sensitive depiction of high-spatial-frequency information even at higher R. In the brain, ReCat improves peak SNR (PSNR) by 1. 1 ± 1. 0 dB over SPIRiT and by 0. 9 ± 0. 3 dB over PE-SSFP (mean±std across subjects; average for N= 2 - 8, R= 8 - 16).

40|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) is a valuable tool for mapping brain activity in many fields. Since functional activity is determined by temporal signal changes, undesired fluctuations from physiological motion are problematic. Simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging can alleviate these issues by accelerating image acquisition, increasing the temporal resolution. Furthermore, some applications require a temporal resolution higher than what conventional fMRI will allow. Current research in SMS has focused on Cartesian readouts due to their ease in analysis and reconstruction. However, non-Cartesian readouts such as spirals have shorter readout times and better signal recovery. This work explores the acquisition and reconstruction of both spiral and concentric ring readouts in parallel SMS. The concentric ring readout retains most {{of the benefits of}} spirals, but also increases the usability of alternative reconstruction techniques for non-Cartesian SMS such as generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA). To date, non-Cartesian SMS imaging has only been reconstructed with sensitivity encoding (SENSE), but results in this work indicate GRAPPA-based reconstructions have reduced root-mean-square-error compared to SENSE and good subjective image quality as well. Furthermore, using point spread function analysis, the concentric ring trajectory is found to have superior slice separation properties compared to a spiral one. Since parallel imaging greatly magnifies the amount of data used for reconstruction, a novel <b>coil</b> <b>compression</b> method is developed, which outperforms conventional <b>coil</b> <b>compression</b> in fMRI, substantially decreasing the amount of reconstruction time needed for sufficient detection of functional activation. Results indicate that the proposed method can compress 3 simultaneous slice data using a 32 -channel coil down to only 10 virtual coils without any adverse effects in functional activation, noise, or image artifacts. Competing methods require substantially more coils for preservation of the data, resulting in large reconstruction time savings for the proposed method. This work also explores the use of Hadamard-encoded fMRI for increased temporal resolution. Because Hadamard-encoded SMS uses data from multiple time frames to separate slices, physiological noise correction is critical. However, even with physiological noise correction, results indicate Hadamard-encoded fMRI is not as reliable as conventional fMRI due to undesired temporal fluctuations, most notably from uncorrected physiological noise...|$|R

40|$|For the {{compression}} of a cylindrical plasma by fast rising axial magnetic fields, the initial state of this plasma is {{of critical importance}} (1). Therefore experiments with a preheating discharge {{for the production of}} an initial plasma with known and reproducible properties were started at this laboratory simultaneously with the first experiments on {{the compression}} of a weakly preionized deuterium gas. An electrodeless ring discharge was chosen. The absence of electrodes makes a high degree of purity of the plasma possible. Kolb's experience with a preheating discharge for magnetic com-pression experiments (2) confirmed this conception and gave further impulse to this work. Early experiments were made with a RF-transmitter as current generator, in pulsed as weIl as in stationary operation. Dueto the low inductance of the <b>compression</b> <b>coil</b> considerable difficulties are met in coupling the RF power to the discharge. The maximum available power is limited to some hundred kilowatts. By discharging a low inductance condenser on the <b>compression</b> <b>coil</b> a damped RF pulse with apower of 100 M Watt is easily obtained. To avoid prefiring of the main condenser bank, the voltage of the coil must be lirnited. With the spark gaps used at this laboratory the maximum permissible voltage at the coil was about 5 kV. This voltage, however, is sufficient to start an electrodeless ring discharge in hydrogen. Investigations on this electrodeless ring discharge were made with and without a steady magnetic bias field in a wide pressure range.

A general experimental technique has been developed which allows the formation of a plasma with controlled amounts of internal magnetic field, and the subsequent compression of this plasma. The method uses three capacitor banks which can be switched with a high precision consecutively on the same <b>compression</b> <b>coil.</b> As the same <b>compression</b> <b>coil</b> is used in all stages of the experiment, this technique preserves symmetry and can therefore be applied for different field configu rations and coil dimensions, in contrast to other methods for preheating.

Larger versions have a strong <b>compression</b> <b>coil</b> spring as part of the attachment mechanism that pulls the knife against the stationary edge as the knife is drawn down to cut the paper. The other end of the knife unit is a handle. The stationary right edge of the base is also steel, with an exposed, finely-ground edge. When the knife is pulled down to cut paper, the action resembles that of a pair of scissors, only instead of two knives moving against each other, one is stationary. The combination of a blade mounted to a steady base produces clean and straight cuts, the likes of which would have otherwise required a ruler and razor blade to achieve on a single page. Paper cutters are also used for cutting thin sheet metal, cardboard, and plastic. The blade on a paper cutter is made of steel which makes it almost impossible to break.|$|R
