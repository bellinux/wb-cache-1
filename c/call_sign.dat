50|$|Military <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> {{assigned}} {{as unique}} identifiers to military communications. In wartime, monitoring an adversary's communications {{can be a}} valuable form of intelligence. Consistent <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> can aid in this monitoring, so in wartime, military units often employ tactical <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> and sometimes change them at regular intervals. In peacetime, some military stations will use fixed <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> in the international series.|$|R
50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>signs</b> in India {{are unique}} {{identifiers}} for telecommunications and broadcasting in India.

Leslie Golliday used his {{initials}} for the station's <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b> Golliday, who also owned Martinsburg's WEPM, envisioned a network of stations across the state of West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Poor health forced Kolbe {{to return}} to Poland in 1936. Two years later, in 1938, he started a radio station at Niepokalanów, the Radio Niepokalanów. He held an amateur radio licence, with the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> SP3RN.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} radio {{stations}} in the province, {{two of which are}} operated by the Radyo Natin Network and the other, Charm FM 100.5MHz, by the Polytechnic Foundation of Cotabato and Asia. Radyo Natin Network operates the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> DWMM at 104.5MHz on FM radio from Looc, as well as the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> DZVG 101.3MHz on FM radio from Odiongan.

Romblon News, meanwhile, provides provincial and national news and information via the web and social media.|$|E
50|$|Amateur {{radio or}} ham radio <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are unique {{identifiers}} for the 60,000 licensed operators. Ofcom allots the individual <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> to the amateurs it licences. <b>Call</b> <b>signs</b> are {{the property of}} Ofcom even when assigned.|$|R
50|$|Argentinian {{broadcast}} <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> {{consist of}} two (or, more recently, three) letters followed by multiple numbers. The second letter, {{as used in}} television <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> from the 1960s, traditionally indicated the region; LS <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> were given to stations in Buenos Aires, LT in the northeastern region, LU in the southern region, LV in the central region and LW in the northwestern region. (LR was used for some radio stations, especially in Buenos Aires; the earliest radio stations in the Argentine capital had <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> of LR plus one digit.) Most TV stations had <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> with higher two-digit numbers. The five main stations in the Buenos Aires area had <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> from LS 82 to LS 86, while stations in Rosario, Santa Fe had <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> LT 83 and LT 85.|$|R
50|$|Maritime <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> {{assigned}} {{as unique}} identifiers to ships and boats.|$|R
5|$|There {{were many}} reports of {{tropical}} storm-force winds from {{ships in the}} north Atlantic. One ship, with the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> GBSA, encountered Tanya's winds twice and reported the strongest winds from any ship, 71mph (112km/h).|$|E
5|$|Humberto {{remained}} in the open Atlantic, and no damage or fatalities were reported. Several ships {{came in contact with}} Humberto while it roamed the open waters. The strongest winds came from <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> DVRUK4, which reported peak winds of 70mph (112km/h) in the central Atlantic on August 30. Three other ships reported tropical storm-force winds.|$|E
5|$|Sailing {{from the}} Indian state of Gujarat to Dubai, a ship with the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> MSV Shiv Sagar MNV 2169 {{encountered}} Keila offshore southern Oman.

50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>signs</b> are {{frequently}} still used by North American broadcast stations, {{in addition to}} amateur radio and other international radio stations that continue to identify by <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> around the world. Each country has {{a different set of}} patterns for its own <b>call</b> <b>signs.</b> <b>Call</b> <b>signs</b> are allocated to ham radio stations in Barbados, Canada, Mexico and across the United States.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} aviator <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are varied. Most <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> play on or {{reference}} on the aviator's surname. Other inspirations for <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> may include personality traits, middle name, references to historical figures, or past exploits during the pilot's career. Aviator <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> nearly always {{must come from}} a member or members of the aviator's squadron, training class, or other cohort.|$|R
50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>signs</b> {{are issued}} {{sequentially}} and specific <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> cannot be requested. Automatic stations (e.g. repeaters) are issued <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> with the separating numeral identifying the band {{on which it}} works and the last letter indicating the type of transmission.|$|R
5|$|The Air Commando sergeants, James J. Stanford and Charles Larimore Jones {{discovered}} the problem, obtained manuals on forward air control {{and went to}} work to resolve the issue. In short order, they arranged rides in Air America and Continental Air Services aircraft and began marking ground targets. The expedient worked and the sergeants, using radio <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> Butterfly, succeeded brilliantly.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Communications Commission {{issued a}} {{construction}} permit for the station on February 14, 2003. The station was assigned the WCSD-LP <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> on March 18, 2003.

Licensed to Shawnee-on-Delaware, the station serves the Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania area {{and is currently}} owned by Shawnee Presbyterian Church.|$|E
5|$|Five ships {{recorded}} {{tropical storm}} force winds {{in association with}} Arthur, of which two were when the storm was extratropical. Early on July 16, a vessel with the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> Weston reported sustained winds of 51mph (82km/h) from the south-southwest, which was the strongest ship reported wind speed. As the storm approached Canada as an extratropical storm, a buoy reported an 8minute average wind speed of 45mph (72km/h), along with a wind gust of 60mph (97km/h).|$|E
50|$|The {{radio station}} {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with the other AM broadcasting station in the Atlanta radio market which carried the WPLO <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> from 1959 until 1987. The 610 kHz station adopted the WPLO <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> in 1990 when it switched from its previous WGNN <b>call</b> <b>signs.</b> WLAW were the original <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> of this station before switching to WGNN in 1987.|$|R
5000|$|The United States Army uses {{fixed station}} <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> which begin with W, such as WAR, used by U.S. Army Headquarters. Fixed <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> for the United States Air Force {{stations}} begin with A, such as AIR, used by USAF Headquarters. The United States Navy, United States Marine Corps, and United States Coast Guard use {{a mixture of}} tactical <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> and international <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> beginning with the letter N.|$|R
5000|$|Merchant {{and naval}} vessels are {{assigned}} <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> by their national licensing authorities. In {{the case of}} states such as Liberia or Panama, which are flags of convenience for ship registration, <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> for larger vessels consist of the national prefix plus three letters (for example, 3LXY, and sometimes followed by a number, i.e. 3LXY2). United States merchant vessels are given <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> beginning with the letters [...] "W" [...] or [...] "K" [...] while US naval ships are assigned callsigns beginning with [...] "N". Originally both ships and broadcast stations were given <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> in this series consisting {{of three or four}} letters, but as demand for both marine radio and broadcast <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> grew, gradually American-flagged vessels were given longer <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> with mixed letters and numbers.|$|R
5|$|In January 1941, Hichens {{was given}} a new command, Motor Gun Boat 64, {{becoming}} the first RNVR officer to command a MGB, and the only RNVR crewed boat in the 6th MGB Flotilla. It was when in command of MGB 64 that Hichens got his nickname Hitch. As each boat needed to select a radio <b>call</b> <b>sign,</b> Hichens {{could not think of}} anything suitable and Lieutenant Arty Shaw suggested Hitch, which stuck and remained with him {{for the rest of his}} time with the coastal forces.|$|E
5|$|Soon after World War II, amateur radio, {{also called}} ham radio, made its {{appearance}} in Gibraltar. The Gibraltar Amateur Radio Society, with its headquarters on Coaling Island, operates from the lighthouse once annually, {{during the third}} weekend of August. The annual International Lighthouse and Lightship Weekend has as its goal in Gibraltar of putting the Europa Point Lighthouse on the air, using the <b>call</b> <b>sign,</b> ZB2LGT. The Amateur Radio Lighthouse Society (ARLHS) number for the lighthouse is GIB-001.|$|E
5|$|To {{obtain a}} licence, {{candidates}} must pass the Amateur Station Operator's Certificate examination {{conducted by the}} WPC. The examination consists of two 50-mark written sections: Radio theory and practice, Regulations; and a practical test consisting of a demonstration of Morse code proficiency in sending and receiving. After passing the examination, the candidate must clear a police interview. After clearance, the WPC grants the licence along with the user-chosen <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b> This procedure {{can take up to}} one year. This licence is valid for up to five years.|$|E

5|$|VC-25 – This {{aircraft}} is the U.S. Air Force {{very important}} person (VIP) version of the 747-200B. The U.S. Air Force operates {{two of them in}} VIP configuration as the VC-25A. Tail numbers 28000 and 29000 are popularly known as Air Force One, which is technically the air-traffic <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> for any United States Air Force aircraft carrying the U.S. President. Although based on the 747-200B design, they include several innovations introduced on the 747-400. Partially completed aircraft from Everett, Washington, were flown to Wichita, Kansas, for final outfitting.|$|E
5|$|WWV is the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> of the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) HF ("shortwave") {{radio station}} located near Fort Collins, Colorado. WWV {{continuously}} transmits official U.S. Government frequency and time signals on 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 MHz. The 25 MHz frequency was last used in 2014 on an experimental basis. It was later dropped {{due to an}} insufficient solar flux level needed for propagation of the higher HF or shortwave frequencies. This condition began {{to occur in the}} latter years of the current sunspot cycle 24.|$|E
5|$|Hambleton, whose <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> was Bat 21 Bravo, was {{positioned}} immediately behind the pilot, {{who gave the}} signal for everyone to eject. Hambleton pulled the ejection seat handles and had a moment {{to make eye contact}} with the pilot as his seat rocketed out of the dying plane. A moment later, the aircraft was struck by a second SA-2 and exploded. The remainder of the aircraft's six-man crew—Maj. Wayne L. Bolte, pilot; 1st Lt.. Robin F. Gatwood, co-pilot; and EWOs Lt. Col. Anthony R. Giannangeli, Lt. Col. Charles A. Levis, and Maj. Henry M. Serex—were unable to eject and were listed as missing in action. Their remains were never found.|$|E
50|$|Spacecraft <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are radio <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> {{used for}} {{communication}} in manned spaceflight. These are not formalized or regulated {{to the same}} degree as other equivalent forms of transportation, like aircraft. The three nations currently launching manned space missions use different methods to identify the ground and space radio stations; the United States uses either the names given to the space vehicles, or else the project name and mission number. Russia traditionally assigns code names as <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> to individual cosmonauts, more in the manner of aviator <b>call</b> <b>signs,</b> rather than to the spacecraft.|$|R
50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>signs</b> in Argentina {{are unique}} {{identifiers}} for communication. <b>Call</b> <b>signs</b> are regulated internationally by the ITU {{as well as}} nationally by the Comisión Nacional de Comunicaciones of the Argentine government.|$|R
50|$|In 1999 Palestine was {{allocated}} the E4 {{block of}} <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> and the Palestine Authority granted visitor licenses. Some Hungarian and Japanese nationals used /E4 following their <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> from that date.|$|R
