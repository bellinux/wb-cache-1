The {{three-dimensional}} size, morphology {{and distribution}} of Ni 4 Ti 3 precipitates growing in binary Ni-rich Ni-Ti alloys have been investigated via a slice & view procedure in a Dual-Beam FIB/SEM system, {{in order to better}} XQGHUVWDQG WKHLU LQIOXHQFH RQ WKH % WR %¶ PDUWHQVLWLF WUDQVIRUPDWLRQ,Q WKH SUHVHQW ZRUN ERWK D VWUess-free Ni 50. 8 Ti 49. 2 alloy with all four variants of precipitates and a compressed Ni 51 Ti 49 alloy with aligned precipitates in one family were studied. The Ni 4 Ti 3 precipitates reach a volume fraction of 9. 6 % in the reconstructed region of the stress-free alloy and 4. 3 % in the compressed one. In both cases, the mean volume, specific surface area, sphericity and aspect ratio of the precipitates are calculated and the Pair Distribution Functions of the precipitates are obtained. It is shown that most precipitates in the stress-free sample grow larger and have a more lenticular shape, while those in the compressed sample are more <b>cylindrical.</b> <b>Deviations</b> from these ideal shapes reveal internal steps in the stress-free sample and lamellae formation in the compressed one. 1...|$|E

Charge material tube is precision welded cold drawn with an outer diameter ø 57 mm, made of stainless E 355. Reduced pipe is used for cylinder hydraulic shock absorber. Formed cylinder is part of the structure MacPherson strut front suspension vehicle. Tube reduction process is carried out with cold working by using a hydraulic press.

The result of numerical simulation is a map of HMH stress. As well as the effect of the transition profile, angle the value of the tool diameter of the inner pipe, wall thickness and the value of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>deviation</b> effect.

Simulation of reduce tubes was carried out with DEFORM 3 D software based on the finite element method.

40|$|AbstractSurface {{deviations}} of parts have vital {{impact on the}} function and performance of products, and should be controlled in manufacturing. Deviation representation facilitates the analysis of product function and performance, {{as well as the}} control of manufacturing process. In this paper, a novel deviation representation method for cylindrical surface is proposed. Instead of the Cartesian coordinate system, a two-dimensional curvilinear coordinate system is established on the ideal cylindrical surface to represent the surface. By adding a deviation dimension in the curvilinear coordinates, a deviation coordinate system is constructed to represent the non-ideal cylindrical surface. The data mapping between the two coordinate systems is presented and typical <b>cylindrical</b> surfaces with <b>deviations</b> are provided as examples to illustrate the formulated deviation representation approach...|$|R
40|$|The construction, alignment, and {{performance}} of a setup for broadband wide-angle dispersion measurements, with emphasis on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements, are presented in comprehensive detail. In contrast with most SPR instruments working with a monochromatic source, this setup takes advantage of a broadband/white light source and has full capability for automated angle vs. wavelength dispersion measurements for any arbitrary nanostructure array. A cylindrical prism is used rather than a triangular one in order to mitigate refraction induced effects and allow for such measurements. Although seemingly simple, this instrument requires use of many non-trivial methods {{in order to achieve}} proper alignment over all angles of incidence. Here we describe the alignment procedure for such a setup, the pitfalls introduced from the finite beam width incident onto the <b>cylindrical</b> prism, and <b>deviations</b> in the reflected/transmitted beam resulting from the finite thickness of the sample substrate. We address every one of these issues and provide experimental evidences on the success of this instrument and the alignment procedure used. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics. ...|$|R
