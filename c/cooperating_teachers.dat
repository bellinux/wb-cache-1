It examines the changes in identity that the student teachers underwent and how those changes came about. The goals motivating this inquiry were (1) to understand the process through which the transition from student teacher to teacher occurred, and (2) to understand what influence the people surrounding the student teachers, such as the <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> and the supervisor, had on the process.

Through {{an examination of}} the identity of the <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher,</b> this study interrogates the relationships that exist between the pedagogical and the practical in pre-service teacher education, specifically within the phenomenon of student teaching. An investigation of the lifeworld of the <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher,</b> exclusively through her use of language, reveals the experience of living one's expectations for another (the student teacher). Through a close examination of the identity of the <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> as mentor, a complex and dynamic relationship between two people is revealed, comprised of a myriad of power implications. To understand {{what it means to be}} a <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> is to understand the meaning structures that have come to restrict, challenge, or question the nature of mentoring and, consequently, student teaching. This study takes investigative and analytical methodologies towards a more nuanced approach to performing research, specifically through Mark Vagle's post-intentional phenomenology, Gunther Kress's multimodal discourse analysis, Norman Fairclough's critical discourse analysis, and critical arts-based research in the style of Postcolonial activist artist, Jean Michel Basquiat.

40|$|A {{trend in}} {{agricultural}} {{education has been}} a shortage of graduates from preservice agricultural education programs who choose to enter the teaching profession, thus causing a deficit {{in the number of}} qualified teachers to fill vacancies. When examining preservice agricultural education programs, student teaching is often the capstone experience, during which, the student teacher works closely with the <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher.</b> Given that the student teaching experience is often the final semester of preservice agricultural education programs, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that satisfaction with that experience contributed to a student teacher’s decision to enter the teaching profession.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} important elements and placement practices of student teaching as perceived by teacher educators and how well each student teacher perceived his/her quality of experience based on these criteria. Data were collected using mail questionnaires following procedures by Dillman (2000). Three different mail questionnaires were used to gather information from 50 different head teacher educators (35 responding), 77 teacher educators (45 responding), and 204 student teachers from the 2001 - 2002 academic school year (140 responding). Head teacher educator respondents indicated that the number one placement practice for placing student teachers was that of the <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> having at least three years teaching experience (mean= 4. 61) Teacher educator respondents indicated that a cooperating center having access to the World Wide Web (mean= 4. 79) was the most important element of a <b>cooperating</b> center. Additionally, <b>teacher</b> educators indicated that a <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> who supports other school activities was the most important <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> element (mean= 4. 28). As a whole, student teachers indicated that they learned a great deal from their student teaching experience (mean= 4. 65) and that the student teaching component of their teacher education program was the most valuable component (mean= 4. 54). Statistically siginificant relationships between student teacher perceptions of their cooperating center elements and the quality of their student teaching experience existed. The elements with a positive correlation and statistical significance included cooperating center facilities (r=. 447) and <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> and student teacher relationships (r=. 853). The correlation coefficient (r=. 389) between the level of importance of student teaching placement methods and the quality of the student teacher experience indicated a low positive relationship (Davis, 1971, but was not significant at the. 05 alpha level.

30|$|In addition, {{supervision}} by <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> {{and university}} supervisors {{has an important}} role in providing pre-service teachers with opportunities to develop their PCK for teaching science. Based on the findings of Faikhamta and Clarke (2015) and Jantarakantee and Roadrangka (2010), pre-service science teachers rarely receive productive suggestions and feedback from <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> about their teaching. They noted that some <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> did not have any experience or understanding of student-centred approach or constructivist-based teaching and suggested that the pre-service teachers consult with their supervisors. However, it was apparent that the <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> need university supervisors to clarify the role of these <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> when they supervise pre-service science teachers in their teaching. <b>Cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> also often feel that teacher education programmes are disconnected from their work. While university supervisors and pre-service teachers work collaboratively, they and <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> have limited opportunities to directly communicate with one another. This problem may be because of traditional models of supervision that are based on a ‘theory into practice’ model. In this model, pre-service teachers learn theories in their university courses and then apply their knowledge in a teaching setting.|$|E

The cases were compared in a cross case analysis to highlight mathematics teaching experiences among EPTs. Data sources included EPT and researcher journal entries, interview transcripts, pre-lesson surveys, field notes, lesson plans, and artifacts of observed lessons. Data were coded using Shulman’s content knowledge, Graeber’s mathematics pedagogical content knowledge, and mathematics anxiety characteristics. ^ Findings revealed both similarities and differences across EPTs as related to four major categories: (a) planning and resources used, (b) role of the <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher,</b> (c) content knowledge, and (d) pedagogical content knowledge.

40|$|The {{contradictory}} {{realities of}} student teaching viewed through the student teachers’ eyes {{have been the}} focus of attention of some recent publications (Britzman, 1991; Knowles and Cole, 1994; Carel, S.; Stuckey, A.; Spalding, A.;Parish, D.; Vidaurri, L; Dahlstrom, K.; and  Rand, Ch., 1996; Weber  Mitchell, 1996). Student teachers are “marginally situated in two worlds” they are to educate others while being educated themselves (Britzman, 1991, p. 13). Playing the two roles simultaneously is highly difficult. The contradictions, dilemmas, and tensions inherent in such endeavor make the world of the student teacher increasingly problematic. This is further complicated by the power relationships that often permeate the student <b>teacher</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> relationship. This paper describes salient aspects of the student teaching journey of Sue, a white twenty-two year old student teacher of Spanish. It uncovers the tensions and dilemmas experienced by the participant in her quest for professional identity. Data collection sources for this study included (a) two open-ended interviews, each lasting approximately forty-five minutes; (b) one school-day long observation; and (c) a copy of the communication journal between the participant and her <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher.</b> The data revealed that soon upon entering the student teaching field experience, Sue found herself torn by the ambiguous role in which student teachers are positioned: she was neither a full-fledged teacher nor a student. In trying to negotiate a teaching role for herself, Sue was pulled in different directions. She soon became aware of the powerful position of the <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> and of her vulnerability within the mentoring relationship. The main tension was manifested in Sue’s struggle to develop her own teaching persona on the one hand, and the pressure to conform to her cooperating teachers’ expectations on the other hand.
