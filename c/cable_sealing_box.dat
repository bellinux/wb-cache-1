50|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>seals</b> {{allow for}} more {{versatile}} application, {{as they have}} variable length of the locking mechanism limited only by the cable length. Typical applications include sealing trucks and railway cars transporting valuable commodities. An internal locking mechanism prevents the cable from being retracted. Most <b>cable</b> <b>seals</b> are classified as security or high security level as to ISO 17712.|$|R

25|$|Carbon {{itself is}} solid at {{case-hardening}} temperatures {{and so is}} immobile. Transport {{to the surface of}} the steel was as gaseous carbon monoxide, generated by the breakdown of the carburising compound and the oxygen packed into the <b>sealed</b> <b>box.</b> This takes place with pure carbon but too slowly to be workable. Although oxygen is required for this process it is re-circulated through the CO cycle and so can be carried out inside a <b>sealed</b> <b>box.</b> The <b>sealing</b> is necessary to stop the CO either leaking out or being oxidised to CO2 by excess outside air.|$|R
40|$|In the {{television}} show Deal or No Deal a contestant is endowed with a <b>sealed</b> <b>box</b> containing a monetary prize between one cent and half a million euros. In {{the course of the}} show the contestant is offered to exchange her <b>box</b> for another <b>sealed</b> <b>box</b> with the same distribution of possible monetary prizes inside. This offers a unique natural experiment for studying endowment effects under high monetary incentives. We find only weak endowment effects when contestants exchange their box for another box with the same distribution of possible prizes...|$|R
40|$|Bronze <b>seal</b> <b>boxes</b> {{that had}} the {{function}} of holding the wax seal on the Viminacium site - Upper Moesia (Stari Kostolac, Serbia), mainly from {{the area of the}} necropolis (ten were found in the graves and ten at the cemetery between the graves). Six are from buildings that had a storage function, five are from public facilities - an amphitheatre, and only one find is from the military fort of the legion VII Claudia, which was stationed in Viminacium {{in the second half of}} the 1 st century. Thirty-two <b>seal</b> <b>boxes</b> have been processed: nine whole, six with fragmented upper and lower parts, seven bases and ten covers. <b>Seal</b> <b>boxes</b> consist of two parts: the cover and the base. The cover is decorated with figural images, concentric rings and especially with applied ornaments. Some of the motifs are filled with enamel. The base always has three to five circular perforations at the bottom, the side walls are a height of 4 to 5 mm with two opposed notches or slots which are thought to have facilitated the tying of the <b>seal</b> <b>box</b> to a package or a document. The lock mechanism is operated using the hinges principle. Some specimens have a circular extension on the cover with a thorn on the bottom. This fits the hollow in the base, through which passes a thorn for the additional fixing of the cover. Based on shape and decoration, <b>seal</b> <b>boxes</b> were classified into five types: I - elliptical or oval shaped with a figural representation on the cover derived in relief; II/ 1 - leaf or heart-shaped with a special, riveted ornament; II/ 2 - leaf or heart-shaped with enamel on the cover; III/ 1 - circular showing a form in relief; III/ 2 - circular with cast concentric rings, with no enamel; III/ 3 - circular with concentric rings with enamel on the cover; IV - diamond shaped with enamel on the cover and V - square with enamel on the cover. The <b>seal</b> <b>boxes</b> dominate chronologically from the first half of the 2 nd and throughout the 3 rd century...|$|R

50|$|The DS Download Station is an in-store demo service {{launched}} by Nintendo in early 2006. As the name states, these are stations {{that can be}} used to download game demos and trailers to a Nintendo DS. The download station consists of a standard retail DS hidden inside a <b>sealed</b> <b>box</b> with a special DS Download Station cartridge inserted in it. The cartridge acts as a server for customers to download new game demos or videos. When Nintendo releases a new demo cartridge to retailers, they simply load the cartridge into the DS locked in the <b>sealed</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R
40|$|Vacuum-assisted {{immersion}} test is {{much faster than}} conventional atmospheric {{immersion test}}s of <b>cable</b> <b>seals.</b> Vacuum speeds removal of air, allowing its replacement by conductive salt solution in leaking specimens. Previously, 24 -hour immersion was necessary to assure displacement of trapped air. Improved method takes only 10 minutes...|$|R

This set {{was also the first}} to introduce [...] "parallel sets" [...] to the series. All 140 base cards came with a parallel gold-foil [...] "Signature" [...] card which came one-to-a-pack. This concept was also used in other Marvel card sets. One exception: there are Jumbo and Walmart retail store boxes of the Hildebrandt 1994 set, and those have Gold and Bronze versions, respectively, of the usually silver Holofoil cards. <b>Sealed</b> <b>boxes</b> of those non-hobby or standard retail kind, especially the Walmart retail store ones with the bronze foil versions, can be quite valuable.

40|$|In the {{television}} show Affari Tuoi a contestant is endowed with a <b>sealed</b> <b>box</b> containing anmonetary prize between one cent and half a million euros.

This offers a unique natural laboratory for testing the predictions of expected utility theory versus prospect theory using lotteries with large stakes. While expected utility theory predicts that an individual is exactly indifferent between accepting and rejecting the exchange offer, prospect theory predictsnthat an individual should always reject the exchange offer due to the assumption of loss aversion. We find that the assumption of loss aversion is violated by 46 percent of all contestants in our recorded sample. Thus, contestants {{do not appear to be}} predominantly loss averse when dealing with lotteries involving large stakes...|$|R
