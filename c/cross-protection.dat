2500|$|Like other viruses, the FMD virus {{continually}} evolves and mutates, thus one of {{the difficulties}} in vaccinating against it is the huge variation between, and even within, serotypes.

2500|$|There {{are several}} H5N1 {{vaccines}} for {{several of the}} avian H5N1 varieties, but the continual mutation of H5N1 renders them of limited use to date: while vaccines can sometimes provide <b>cross-protection</b> against related flu strains, the best protection would be from a vaccine specifically produced for any future pandemic flu virus strain. Dr. Daniel Lucey, co-director of the Biohazardous Threats and Emerging Diseases graduate program at Georgetown University has made this point, [...] "There is no H5N1 pandemic so {{there can be no}} pandemic vaccine". However, [...] "pre-pandemic vaccines" [...] have been created; are being refined and tested; and do have some promise both in furthering research and preparedness for the next pandemic. Vaccine manufacturing companies are being encouraged to increase capacity so that if a pandemic vaccine is needed, facilities will be available for rapid production of large amounts of a vaccine specific to a new pandemic strain.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Cross-protection</b> (see also Influenza vaccine: <b>Cross-protection)</b> is a {{possibility}} for the future. Cross infection means inoculating the coconut with a mild strain of the viroid to give the coconut tree some degree of protection from infection by the killer form. This is similar to Edward Jenner's pioneering smallpox vaccine. He used cowpox to confer induced immunity on humans. But {{in the case of}} Cadang-cadang, this is still under research.|$|E

50|$|One {{risk that}} comes with weak strain {{inoculation}} is increased susceptibility to other viral strains and pathogens. Additionally, {{there is a risk}} that the weak strain could mutate into a more virulent strain. Alternatively, the inoculated weak viral disease might cause synergistic effects if another viral pathogen infects the plant. Despite the risks posed by <b>cross-protection</b> of crops using weak strains, the method has proven valuable in the control of several other viruses. <b>Cross-protection</b> appears to be the most promising option in the case of switchgrass {{because of the lack of}} resistance genes for pathogen control.|$|E

50|$|Currently, CMD {{is managed}} through phytosantitation {{practices}} {{as well as}} the use of conventional resistance breeding. Additionally, vector management and <b>cross-protection</b> help to minimize transmission and symptom development.

50|$|There are no {{vaccines}} {{against these}} viruses {{as there is}} little-to-no <b>cross-protection</b> between serotypes. At least 99 serotypes of Human rhinoviruses affecting humans have been sequenced. However, {{a study of the}} VP4 protein has shown it to be highly conserved among many serotypes of Human rhinovirus, opening up the potential for a future pan-serotype Human rhinovirus vaccine.|$|E
50|$|In immunology, the {{cross-reactivity}} {{has a more}} narrow {{meaning of}} the reaction between an antibody and an antigen that differs from the immunogen. It is sometimes {{also referred to as}} crossimmunity or cross-protective immunity, although cross-reactivity does not necessarily infer <b>cross-protection.</b> A few examples of cross-reactivity have been confirmed in humans, one of which involves influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cell and hepatitis C virus antigens.|$|E
50|$|Until 1955, {{the only}} {{antivenom}} available for general distribution for Australian snakes was the monovalent (specific) tiger snake (Notechis) antivenom, which gave {{varying degrees of}} <b>cross-protection</b> against the bites of most other dangerous Australian snakes.

50|$|There {{are both}} {{attenuated}} vaccines and inactivated vaccines available. Their effectiveness is diminished by poor <b>cross-protection.</b> The {{nature of the}} protective immune response to IBV is poorly understood, but the surface spike protein, the amino-terminal S1 half, is sufficient to induce good protective immunity. Experimental vector IB vaccines and genetically manipulated IBVs—with heterologous spike protein genes—have produced promising results, including {{in the context of}} in ovo vaccination.|$|E
50|$|In studies, {{the vaccine}} appears both {{effective}} and safe, providing a strong {{protective immune response}} and having similar safety profile to the normal seasonal influenza vaccine. However, about 30% of people already have some immunity to the virus, with the vaccine conferring greatest benefit on young people, since many older people are already immune through exposure to similar viruses in the past. The vaccine also provides some <b>cross-protection</b> against the 1918 flu pandemic strain.|$|E
50|$|Cross {{protection}} {{is similar in}} practice, although not in mode of action, to viral vaccinations in humans. A mild strain of PRSV is introduced into the host plant, which then develops resistance to virulent strains of the virus. Development of <b>cross-protection</b> in papaya was researched in Hawaii starting in 1979. A delay in the onset of symptoms was achieved, {{as well as a}} reduction in the severity of symptoms. However, inoculation of the mild strain also caused pathogenesis on the papaya plants.|$|E
50|$|DA2PP, is a {{multivalent}} vaccine for dogs that protects against the viruses {{indicated by the}} alphanumeric characters forming the acronym: D for canine distemper, A2 for canine adenovirus type 2, which offers <b>cross-protection</b> to canine adenovirus type 1 (the more pathogenic of the two strains) (see Canine adenovirus), the first P for canine parvovirus, and the second P for parainfluenza. Because infectious canine hepatitis is another name for canine adenovirus type 1, an H is sometimes used instead of A. In DA2PPC, the C indicates canine coronavirus.|$|E

50|$|There is {{no known}} {{resistance}} to PRSV, although certain varieties are more symptomatic than others. There are four main methods of control for PRSV: quarantine and geographic displacement, roguing and netting, <b>cross-protection,</b> and genetic {{modification of the}} host plant. Because PRSV is a non-persistent virus and is consequently transmitted to healthy plants by aphids within {{a very short time}} period, insecticidal control is difficult and impractical. Once symptoms have been observed, it is already too late to spray for aphids - the disease has most likely already been transmitted to nearby healthy plants. In order to implement successful vector control, frequent preventative sprays are required, which is rarely done.|$|E
5000|$|..... Until now, {{researchers}} {{have been working on}} prepandemic vaccines for H5N1 viruses in clade 1. In March, the first clinical trial of a U.S. vaccine for H5N1 showed modest results. In May, French researchers showed somewhat better results in a clinical trial of an H5N1 vaccine that included an adjuvant. Vaccine experts aren't sure if a vaccine effective against known H5N1 viral strains would be effective against future strains. Although the new viruses will now be available for vaccine research, WHO said clinical trials using the clade 1 viruses should continue as an essential step in pandemic preparedness, because the trials yield useful information on priming, cross-reactivity, and <b>cross-protection</b> by vaccine viruses from different clades and subclades." ...|$|E
50|$|Swine {{influenza}} {{has been}} recognized as a major problem since the outbreak in 1976. Evolution of the virus has resulted in inconsistent responses to traditional vaccines. Standard commercial swine flu vaccines are effective in controlling the problem when the virus strains match enough to have significant <b>cross-protection.</b> Customised (autogenous) vaccines made from the specific viruses isolated, are made and used in the more difficult cases. The vaccine manufacturer Novartis claims that the H3N2 strain (first identified in 1998) has brought major losses to pig farmers. Abortion storms are a common sign and sows stop eating {{for a few days}} and run a high fever. The mortality rate can be as high as 15%.|$|E
50|$|Those {{who travel}} to {{countries}} with poor sanitation should receive a live attenuated typhoid vaccine—Ty21a (Vivotif), which, {{in addition to}} the protection against typhoid fever, and may provide some protection against paratyphoid fever caused by the S. enterica serotypes A and B. In particular, a reanalysis of data from a trial conducted in Chile showed the Ty21a vaccine was 49% effective (95% CI: 8-73%) in preventing paratyphoid fever caused by the serotype B. Evidence from a study of international travelers in Israel also indicates the vaccine may prevent a fraction of infections by the serotype A, although no trial confirms this. This <b>cross-protection</b> by a typhoid vaccine is most likely due to O antigens shared between different S. enterica serotypes.|$|E
50|$|The gene rpoS (RNA polymerase, sigma S) encodes the {{sigma factor}} sigma-38 (σ38, or RpoS), a 37.8 kD protein in Escherichia coli. Sigma factors are {{proteins}} that regulate transcription in bacteria. Sigma factors can be activated {{in response to}} different environmental conditions. rpoS is transcribed in late exponential phase, and RpoS is the primary regulator of stationary phase genes. RpoS is a central regulator of the general stress response and operates in both a retroactive and a proactive manner: it not only allows the cell to survive environmental challenges, but it also prepares the cell for subsequent stresses (<b>cross-protection).</b> The transcriptional regulator CsgD is central to biofilm formation, controlling {{the expression of the}} curli structural and export proteins, and the diguanylate cyclase, adrA, which indirectly activates cellulose production. The rpoS gene most likely originated in the γ branch of the proteobacteria.|$|E
50|$|A {{vaccine is}} {{assessed}} by its efficacy; {{the extent to}} which it reduces risk of disease under controlled conditions, and its effectiveness, the observed reduction in risk after the vaccine is put into use. In the case of influenza, effectiveness is expected to be lower than the efficacy because it is measured using the rates of influenza-like illness, which is not always caused by influenza. Influenza vaccines generally show high efficacy, as measured by the antibody production in animal models or vaccinated people. However, studies on the effectiveness of flu vaccines in the real world are difficult; vaccines may be imperfectly matched, virus prevalence varies widely between years, and influenza is often confused with other influenza-like illnesses. However, in most years (16 of the 19 years before 2007), the flu vaccine strains have been a good match for the circulating strains, and even a mismatched vaccine can often provide <b>cross-protection.</b>|$|E

50|$|Because FMD rarely infects humans but spreads rapidly among animals, it is a {{much greater}} threat to the {{agriculture}} industry than to human health. Farmers around the world can lose {{huge amounts of money}} during a foot-and-mouth epidemic, when large numbers of animals are destroyed and revenues from milk and meat production go down. One of the difficulties in vaccinating against FMD is the huge variation between and even within serotypes. There is no <b>cross-protection</b> between serotypes (meaning that a vaccine for one serotype won't protect against any others) and in addition, two strains within a given serotype may have nucleotide sequences that differ by as much as 30% for a given gene. This means that FMD vaccines must be highly specific to the strain involved. Vaccination only provides temporary immunity that lasts from months to years. Therefore, rich countries maintain a policy of banning import from all countries, not proven FMD-free by US or EU standards. This is a point of contention.|$|E
5000|$|H5N1 {{continually}} mutates, meaning vaccines {{based on}} current samples of avian H5N1 cannot be depended upon {{to work in the}} case of a future pandemic of H5N1.

Standard commercial swine flu vaccines are effective in controlling the infection when the virus strains match enough to have significant <b>cross-protection,</b> and custom (autogenous) vaccines made from the specific viruses isolated are created and used in the more difficult cases.Present vaccination strategies for SIV control and prevention in swine farms typically include the use of one of several bivalent SIV vaccines commercially available in the United States. Of the 97 recent H3N2 isolates examined, only 41 isolates had strong serologic cross-reactions with antiserum to three commercial SIV vaccines. Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus, the presence of nonreactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses. The United States Department of Agriculture researchers say while pig vaccination keeps pigs from getting sick, it does not block infection or shedding of the virus.|$|E
5000|$|David M. Knipe, a Professor at Harvard Medical School has {{developed}} dl5-29. The dl5-29 vaccine {{is also known}} under the name ACAM-529 or HSV-529, a replication-defective vaccine that has proved successful in preventing both HSV-2 and HSV-1 infections and in combating the virus in already-infected hosts, in animal models. The HSV-529 is a leading vaccine candidate which has been investigated in numerous research publications, and is endorsed by many researchers in the field (i.a. Lynda A. Morrison and Jeffrey Cohen). [...] It {{has also been shown}} that the vaccine induces strong HSV-2-specific antibody and T-cell responses, protects against challenge with a wild-type HSV-2 virus, reduces the severity of recurrent disease, provides <b>cross-protection</b> against HSV-1. The ongoing trials would prove if a durable immune response in humans is to be successfully achieved or if the vaccine is too over attenuated to do the same. The vaccine is now being researched and developed by Sanofi Pasteur. Both Sanofi Pasteur and the clinical-stage immunotherapy company Immune Design have entered a broad collaboration, which will explore the potential of various combinations of agents against HSV-2, including an adjuvanted trivalent vaccine candidate G103, consisting of recombinantly-expressed viral proteins.|$|E
50|$|Evidence {{has been}} {{collected}} {{that suggests that}} <b>cross-protection</b> against a diverse range of CBSD-causing virus isolates can be achieved through RNAi silencing. The conserved CP gene, which serves multiple functions in the CBSV life cycle, {{was used as the}} transgene of interest. Three distinct RNAi constructs were designed to target the FL, N-terminal, and C-terminal of the UCBSV-CP gene: the FL-CP construct exhibiting the highest level of protection. In conclusion, the study found a significant positive correlation between the presence of siRNAs and viral protection against UCBSV. A negative drawback to this antiviral approach is that RNAi is highly sequence specific. Viruses with more than 10% nucleotide diversity require the development of an RNAi construct with multiple fragments from different virus species. A construct made out of such large sections of genes could be very unstable during cloning and transformation procedures. However, the study included two transgenic plant lines in which remained completely immune to viral infection against six unique isolates of both UCBSV and CBSV. RNAi FL-CP transgenic cassava lines also experienced 100% immunity when grafted with UCBSV infected cassava samples compared to nontransgenic control lines which became 100% infected with UCBSV over the 60-day period. In the fields, it is common for asymptomatic plants to carry the virus and serve as a source of transmission with the help of whitefly vectors or stem cuttings. However, the study also collected RT-PCR data that suggested all asymptomatic plants also lacked detectable levels of UCBSV.|$|E
