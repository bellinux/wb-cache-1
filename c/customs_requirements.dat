30|$|In {{the pilot}} phase of JC:HEM, courses were largely donated by {{contributing}} universities such {{that there was}} a need to purchase and ship the designated textbooks to the sites. Shipping was not only expensive but posed significant logistical challenges in terms of transportation, legal and <b>customs</b> <b>requirements</b> that frequently resulted in significant delays. JC:HEM experimented with various methods to address these challenges, including the purchase of Kindles onto which texts could be downloaded. Yet, early versions of the Kindle were difficult to use in bright light and often proved too fragile for the hot and rough conditions of refugee camps. Not all of the required texts were available in electronic versions, and when available, texts were not noticeably cheaper per unit. Interestingly, the students themselves expressed a preference for hard copies of the texts - considering them easier to use and more durable. As JC:HEM developed over time, there was a conscious effort to move away from text-based inputs and a greater use of bespoke video and audit inputs. Text, where it was used, often relied upon open-source materials and was incorporated into the online course itself.|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Both the United States and the European Union (EU) began providing trade preferences to eligible developing countries in the early 1970 s. These trade preferences, which reduced tariffs and product quotas, are "nonreciprocal," meaning that beneficiaries need not reciprocate with lower tariffs for donor export countries. This report discusses (1) the volume of U. S. and EU nonreciprocal preferential trade, (2) the U. S. and EU approaches to nonreciprocal trade preferences, (3) the tariff preferences offered by the U. S. and EU nonreciprocal trade programs, and (4) {{the extent to which}} U. S. and EU program beneficiaries take advantage of the tariff preferences offered under the programs. GAO found that the volume of imports receiving preferential tariff rates under U. S. and EU nonreciprocal trade preference programs in 1999 represented a relatively small share of total U. S. and EU imports, at two percent ($ 18 billion) and six percent ($ 45 billion), respectively. The U. S. and EU approaches to nonreciprocal preferential trade have evolved in similar ways since their inception in the early 1970 s. U. S. and EU programs have included increasingly more products, particularly to the poorest countries, and have, over time, relaxed <b>customs</b> <b>requirements</b> that specify where and how products can be made. Despite some program differences, the U. S. and EU nonreciprocal preference arrangements offer relatively similar tariff preferences on average. On the whole, EU programs cover more products than do U. S. programs, but U. S. beneficiary countries use more of their available tariff preferences than do EU beneficiaries. ...|$|E

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 39). Internship is a partial requirement of post graduation. As a student of Master of business administration analyzing today’s business world is very crucial. It is necessary {{to go through all}} fields of knowledge, both theoretical and practical. After completing two years MBA program, I was sent out to have practical knowledge in business life as a part of my academic program. In this report I had tried to focus my both theoretical and practical knowledge regarding freight practices. My internship topic is ‘Freight Forwarding business of UTi Pership”. Freight Forwarder is a firm specializing in arranging storage and shipping of merchandise on behalf of its shippers. It usually provides a full range of services including: tracking inland transportation, preparation of shipping and export documents, warehousing, booking cargo space, negotiating freight charges, freight consolidation, cargo insurance, and filing of insurance claims. Freight forwarders usually ship under their own bills of lading or air waybills (called house bill of lading or house air waybill) and their agents or associates at the destination (overseas freight forwarders) provide document delivery, deconsolidation, and freight collection services. The International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations (FIATA) shorthand description of the freight forwarder as the 'Architect of Transport' illustrates the commercial position of the forwarder relative to its client. Freight forwarding services negotiate the best possible price to move the product along the most economical route by working out various bids and choosing the one that best balances speed, cost and reliability. Freight forwarding service then undertakes the responsibility of arranging the transport from point of origin to destination. The history of Freight Forwarding is not too old. One of the earliest freight forwarders was Thomas Meadows and Company Limited of London, England, established in 1836. According to "Understanding the Freight Business," written and published by the executive staff of Thomas Meadows and Company in 1972, the advent of reliable rail transport and steamships created demand for the fledgling freight forwarding industry. Trade developed between Europe and North America, creating additional demand. The first international freight forwarders were innkeepers in London who held and re-forwarded the personal effects of their hotel guests. Forwarder responsibilities include advice on documentation and <b>customs</b> <b>requirements</b> in the country of destination. And the correspondent agent in overseas look after customers' goods and keep informed about matters that would affect movement of goods. In a single transaction, the forwarder may be acting as a carrier (principal) or as an agent for his customer or both. Mohammed Mehedi HasanM. Business Administratio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{multi-tenant}} software as {{a service}} (SaaS) system has {{to meet the needs of}} several tenant organizations, which connect to the system to utilize its services. To leverage economies of scale through re-use, a SaaS vendor would, in general, like to drive commonality amongst the requirements across tenants. However, many tenants will also come with some <b>custom</b> <b>requirements</b> that may be a pre-requisite for them to adopt the SaaS system. These requirements then need to be addressed by evolving the SaaS system in a controlled manner, while still supporting the requirements of existing tenants. In this paper, we focus on functional variability amongst tenants in a multi-tenant SaaS and develop a framework to help evolve such systems systematically. We adopt an intuitive formal model of services that is easily amenable to tenant requirement analysis and provides a robust way to support multiple tenant onboarding, which is modeled as a bi-objective optimization problem that attempts to maximize vendor profit and tenant functional commonality. We perform a substantial case study of a multi-tenant blog server to demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{this work}} a {{procedure}} for the optimization of the bit loading in a PLC system implementing OFDM modulation is presented. The optimization strategy aims {{to find the}} best compromise between Signal Power, Bit Rate (BR), Bit Error Rate (BER) and Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR). The problem is approached from two points of view. First, the conflicting objectives of Signal Power, Bit Rate and Bit Error Rate are optimized off line by means of a Multi-Objective approach. A Tabu Search-based search engine has been adapted to the Multi Objective Optimization in order to find a set of Pareto solutions, among which the designer has to take the final choice {{on the basis of the}} <b>custom</b> <b>requirements.</b> Secondly, the Selected Mapping method is used on line to reduce the PAPR, finding the best compromise between maximum Bit Rate and minimum PAPR. A semi analytical procedure, described in the paper, is used to determine the optimal phase factor vector. The suitability of the approach has been evaluated referring to the real case of a PLC system implemented in a mega yacht. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 46). A freight forwarder, forwarder, or forwarding agent is a person or company that organizes shipments for individuals or corporations to get goods from the manufacturer or producer to a market, customer or final point of distribution. Forwarders contract with a carrier to move the goods. A forwarder does not move the goods but acts as an expert in supply chain management. A forwarder contracts with carriers to move cargo ranging from raw agricultural products to manufactured goods. Information typically reviewed by a freight forwarder includes the commercial invoice, shipper's export declaration, bill of lading and other documents required by the carrier or country of export, import, and/or transhipment. Nowadays, the freight forwarding is not limited within the same geographical limit of any country. Due to globalization and free market economy, this industry is facing severe competition. As the competition among companies are rapidly increasing, many companies are trying to provide distinct services in terms of air freight forwarding, sea freight forwarding, customs brokerage, consolidation, logistics management, Off-Dock services, household removal, transportation and so on. Novo Cargo is totally committed to provide a total transportation services to their clients irrespective {{of the size of}} consignment. They plan, coordinate, supervise, document and monitor the entire movement system of consignment. As Freight forwarding and logistics service sector is gradually developing to be a huge service sector so I am glad {{to have an opportunity to}} work in Novo cargo Services Ltd. to explore their activities and build up an analytical insight regarding their services. As important freight forwarding and logistics services, Off-Dock offers entire item-wise package of service activities for handling the temporary empty/laden container storage, loading/unloading general export/import goods, and containers under custom clearance. It is an equivalent of a seaport located in the hinterland. Novo Cargo uses Esack depot as a part of Off-Dock facilities which is located adjacent to Chittagong port. Novo Cargo’s dynamic approach to household removal business is well supported by the concerned authorities in Bangladesh. The objective of the company is to deliver reliable, cost effective transportation and management of clients’ goods. Novo Cargo also offers other comprehensive services like air and sea freight, surface services, customs brokerages, cargo management, chartering, consolidation, warehousing and distribution, inland transportation and so on. SWOT, PEST and STP analysis of Novo Cargo are done here to identify its competitive advantage through analyzing its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, find out macro-environmental factors used in the environmental scanning and use the formula of segmentation, targeting and positioning for strategic marketing. Though Novo Cargo is also facing more or less challenging situations in the current market, but it is well organized and is able to offer a full range of professional logistics services to its customers as well as overseas partners. It operates with a commitment to the global sea and air freight customers through highly qualified and experienced professional team specializing in all international logistics and <b>customs</b> <b>requirements.</b> Novo Cargo keenly focuses on enhancing long term sustainability in the market by providing quality commitment to its clients.

40|$|Quadrature {{phase shift}} keying (QPSK) {{is one of the}} most popular {{modulation}} schemes in coherent optical communication systems for data rates in excess of 40 Gbps because of its high spectral efficiency. This paper proposes a simple method of implementing a QPSK modulator in integrated optic (IO) domain. The QPSK modulator is realized using standard IO components, such as Y-branches and electro-optic modulators (EOMs). Design optimization of EOM is carried out considering the fabrication constraints, miniaturization aspects, and simplicity. Also, the interdependency between electrode length, operating voltage, and electrode gap of an EOM has been captured in the form of a family of curves. These plots enable designing of EOMs for <b>custom</b> <b>requirements.</b> An innovative approach has been adopted in demonstrating the operation of IO QPSK modulator in terms of phase data extracted from beam propagation model. The results obtained by this approach have been verified using the conventional interferometric approach. The operation of the proposed IO QPSK modulator is experimentally demonstrated. The design of IO QPSK modulator is taken up as a part of a broader scheme that aims at generation of QPSK modulated microwave signal based on optical heterodyning.
