40|$|Abstract This article {{presents}} a columns reinforcement experimental study, {{with the use}} of anchor steel bolts and fill with self-compacting concrete. Were tested five columns of reinforced concrete subjected to flexion-compression: two columns were used as reference, and a cross-section equal to 120 x 250 mm; with a monolithic section equal to 155 x 250 mm cross section of the same reinforced columns and three which were initially molded with a 120 x 250 mm section and subsequently received a layer of 35 mm thick self-compacting concrete in the compressed side. Despite the studs do not present break, there was peeling of the reinforcement layer.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} the underestimation of {{tree and}} shrub heights for different airborne laser scanner systems and point cloud distribution within the vegetation <b>column.</b> <b>Reference</b> data {{was produced by}} a novel UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS) with a high point density in the complete vegetation column. With its physical parameters (e. g. footprint) and its relative accuracy within the block as stated in Section 2. 2 the reference data {{is supposed to be}} highly suitable to detect the highest point of the vegetation. An airborne topographic (ALS) and topo-bathymetric (ALB) system were investigated. All data was collected in a period of one month in leaf-off condition, while the dominant tree species in the study area are deciduous trees. By robustly estimating the highest 3 d vegetation point of each laser system the underestimation of the vegetation height was examined in respect to the ULS reference data. This resulted in a higher under-estimation of the airborne topographic system with 0. 60 m (trees) and 0. 55 m (shrubs) than for the topo-bathymetric system 0. 30 m (trees) and 0. 40 m (shrubs). The degree of the underestimation depends on structural characteristics of the vegetation itself and physical specification of the laser system...|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} the released oil on microbes, either during or immediately after the Deepwater Horizon accident. However, {{little is known about the}} potential longer-term persistent effects on microbial communities and their functions. In this study, one water column station near the wellhead (3. 78 km southwest of the wellhead), one water <b>column</b> <b>reference</b> station outside the affected area (37. 77 km southeast of the wellhead), and deep-sea sediments near the wellhead (3. 66 km southeast of the wellhead) were sampled 1 year after the capping of the well. In order to analyze microbial community composition, function, and activity, we used metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and mineralization assays. Mineralization of hexadecane was significantly higher at the wellhead station at a depth of ~ 1, 200 m than at the reference station. Community composition based on taxonomical or functional data showed that the samples taken at a depth of ~ 1, 200 m were significantly more dissimilar between the stations than at other depths (surface, 100 m, 750 m, and > 1, 500 m). Both Bacteria and Archaea showed reduced activity at depths of ~ 1, 200 m when the wellhead station was compared to the reference station, and their activity was significantly higher in surficial sediments than in 10 -cm sediments. Surficial sediments also harbored significantly different active genera than did 5 - and 10 -cm sediments. For the remaining microbial parameters assessed, no significant differences could be observed between the wellhead and reference stations and between surface and 5 - to 10 -cm-deep sediments.

40|$|We {{construct}} fixed-point wave {{functions and}} exactly solvable commuting-projector Hamiltonians {{for a large}} class of bosonic symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases, based {{on the concept of}} equivalent classes of symmetric local unitary transformations. We argue that for onsite unitary symmetries, our construction realizes all SETs free of anomaly, as long as the underlying topological order itself can be realized with a commuting-projector Hamiltonian. We further extend the construction to anti-unitary symmetries (e. g. time-reversal symmetry), mirror-reflection symmetries, and to anomalous SETs on the surface of three-dimensional symmetry-protected topological phases. Mathematically, our construction naturally leads to a generalization of group extensions of unitary fusion categories to anti-unitary symmetries.

40|$|We propose an {{extension}} of the standard model with a B-L global symmetry that is broken softly at the TeV scale. The neutrinos acquire masses through a type-II seesaw while the lepton (L) asymmetry arises in the singlet sector but without B-L violation. The model has the virtue that the scale of L-number violation (Λ) giving rise to neutrino masses is independent of the scale of leptogenesis (Λ'). As a result the model can explain neutrino masses, singlet scalar dark matter and leptogenesis at the TeV scale. The stability of the dark matter is ensured by a surviving Z_ 2 symmetry, which could be lifted at the Planck scale and thereby allowing Planck scale-suppressed decay of singlet scalar dark matter particles of mass ≈ 3 MeV to e^+ e^- pairs in the Galactic halo. The model also predicts a few hundred GeV doubly charged scalar and a long lived charged fermion, whose decay can be studied at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and International Linear Collider (ILC).

For the other three GFRP tube reinforced concrete columns, one column was subjected to concentric loading, while the other two columns were subjected to eccentric loading with eccentricities of 25 mm and 50 mm.

40|$|Two new {{formulations}} {{of general relativity}} are introduced. The first one is a parabolization of the Arnowitt, Deser, Misner (ADM) formulation and is derived by addition of combinations of the constraints and their derivatives to the right-hand-side of the ADM evolution equations. The desirable property of this modification is that it turns the surface of constraints into a local attractor because the constraint propagation equations become second-order parabolic independently of the gauge conditions employed. This system may be classified as mixed hyperbolic - second-order parabolic. The second formulation is a parabolization of the Kidder, Scheel, Teukolsky formulation and is a manifestly mixed strongly hyperbolic - second-order parabolic set of equations, bearing thus resemblance to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. As a first test, a stability analysis of flat space is carried out and it is shown that the first modification exponentially damps and smoothes all constraint violating modes. These systems provide a new basis for constructing schemes for long-term and stable numerical integration of the Einstein field equations.

Then, the vertex g with the highest degree (following Table  2) is first added to compsub. Its adjacent vertices in the coherence graph are in currentcand if they are spatial neighbours ({f,h}); otherwise, they are in complcand ({a,b,d,e,i,j,l}). A 2 -A 6. At every step, the element, say, v, from currentcand that has {{the largest number of}} connections in the coherence graph with the other candidates (currentcand∪complcand) is added to compsub. In case of ties, one vertex is selected randomly. The spatial neighbours of v in complcand, denoted by Λ(v), are moved from complcand to currentcand. Furthermore, vertices not adjacent to v in the coherence graph, denoted by Γc(v), are removed from both currentcand and complcand. This continues until currentcand is empty. At A 2, v=f, Λ(v)={b,e,j}, and Γc(v)={d,h,l}. At A 3, v=e, Λ(v)={a,i}, and Γc(v)=∅. At A 4, v=a, Λ(v)=∅, and Γc(v)=∅. At A 5, v=b, Λ(v)=∅, and Γc(v)=∅. At A 6, v=i, Λ(v)=∅, and Γc(v)=∅.

40|$|In recent years, {{superfluid}} {{dark matter}} (SfDM) {{has become a}} competitive model of emergent modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) scenario: MOND phenomenons naturally emerge as a derived concept due to an extra force mediated between baryons by phonons {{as a result of}} axion-like particles condensed as superfluid at galactic scales; Beyond galactic scales, these axion-like particles behave as normal fluid without phonon-mediated MOND-like force between baryons, therefore SfDM also maintains the usual success of ΛCDM at cosmological scales. In this paper, we use gravitational waves (GWs) to probe the relevant parameter space of SfDM. GWs through Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) could propagate with a speed slightly deviation from the speed-of-light due to the change in the effective refractive index, which depends on the SfDM parameters and GW-source properties. We find that Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) are the most promising means as GW probe of relevant parameter space of SfDM. Future space-based GW detectors are also capable of probing SfDM if multi-messenger approach is adopted.
