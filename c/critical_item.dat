25|$|In general, two {{different}} light sources {{are needed in}} an operating room: the surgical (operating) lights used for open procedures and the ambient lighting for interventional procedures. Particular attention should {{be paid to the}} possibility to dim the lights. This is frequently needed during fluoroscopy or endoscopy. For the surgical lights it is most important that they cover the complete area across the operating room table. Moreover, they must not interfere with head heights and collision paths of other equipment. The most frequent mounting position of OR-lights is centrally above the OR table. If a different position is chosen, the lights usually are swivelled in from an area outside the OR table. Because one central axis per light head is necessary, this may lead to at least two central axes and mounting points in order to ensure sufficient illumination of the surgical field. The movement range of the angiography system determines the positioning of the OR lights. Central axes must be outside of moving path and swivel range. This is especially important as devices have defined room height requirements that must be met. In this case, head clearance height for the OR-light may be an issue. This makes lights a <b>critical</b> <b>item</b> in the planning and design process. Other aspects in the planning process of OR lights include avoidance of glare and reflections. Modern OR lights may have additional features, like build in camera and video capabilities. For the illumination of the wound area, a double-arm OR-light system is required.

In the meantime, back in Liptovský Mikuláš, Hodža along with twenty delegates created a document entitled Demands of the Slovak Nation which listed 14 points setting national and social goals for the Slovak nation. Naturally this document was received coldly by Budapest, which subsequently imposed martial law on Upper Hungary and issued warrants for Štúr, Hurban and Hodža on 12 May 1848. At the same time, uprisings among Serbs, Croats and Slovenes {{in the southern part of}} Hungary diverted Magyar attention to the south, as these conflicts were more armed uprisings than the Slovak one. Hurban attended a session of the Croatian Diet on 5 July, speaking to the Croats on the plight of the Slovaks.

50|$|With {{the use of}} precast shapes, crew sizing can be minimized. Speed of {{installation}} {{is another}} obvious benefit to both the installer and the owner, resulting in reduced costs due to shorter job duration. Material usage is also reduced, {{when compared to other}} installation methods such as guniting, where as much as 45% of extra material is required to compensate for rebound and other job losses. Environmental hazards such as dusting and tripping hazards associated with equipment and hoses are also reduced substantially, if not eliminated. Future repairs also become much more economical and quicker to accomplish. Repair areas can be isolated to just the immediate wear area within the boundaries of a shape. Anchor attachment points can typically be reused. Replacement shapes, purchased early and kept as spare parts on site, can be easily installed in a fraction of the time required for conventional repair methods. The initial bake-out of a new refractory lining on site can be a very expensive and time-consuming component of a refractory repair project. The use of precast and prefired refractory shapes can sometimes reduce or even eliminate the need for an extensive initial bake-out. If an entire repair is made with a prefired system, then normal furnace start up schedules can be used, without the fear of steam spalls or other damage during the initial heating. Bake-out of multi-component linings, which may include a combination of precast shapes and other materials placed in the field, can often be reduced by the pre-firing of the castable shapes, particularly if that material would have been the <b>critical</b> <b>item</b> determining the bake out schedule.

40|$|In the Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) paradigm, {{subjects}} study {{lists of}} words {{that are designed to}} elicit the recall of an associatively related <b>critical</b> <b>item.</b> The 55 lists we have developed provide levels of false recall ranging from. 01 to. 65, and understanding this variability should provide a key to understanding this memory illusion. Using a simultaneous multiple regression analysis, we assessed the contribution of seven factors in creating false recall of critical items in the DRM paradigm. This analysis accounted for approximately 68 % of the variance in false recall, with two main predictors: associative connections from the study words to the <b>critical</b> <b>item</b> (r 5 1. 73; semipartial r 5 1. 60) and recallability of the lists (r 5. 43; semipartial r 5. 34).

Here, we introduce a behavioral paradigm {{that could be used to}} reveal concealed information by exploiting the link between concealed information and attentional processes more directly.

We hypothe-sized that a well-known face used as a <b>critical</b> <b>item</b> could capture attentional resources automatically, making it harder to detect the occurrence of a subsequently presented target face.

40|$|Tese de doutoramento em Psicologia Especialidade de Psicologia Experimental e Ciências CognitivasThe {{study of}} false {{memories}} is of key importance for two main reasons. First, {{the analysis of}} memory errors and the circumstances leading to their appearance helps us to understand how memory works. And second, in some applied settings (e. g., in the courtroom), the occurrence of false memories may have devastating consequences. If our attempts to understand the normal functioning of memory were {{at the root of}} the first studies of memory errors, the social impact of false memories in some high profile cases contributed significantly to the development of this research area within psychology The experimental paradigms used to study false memories vary with the theoretical stance of the researchers. In the DRM paradigm, used throughout the present study, participants are exposed to lists of words that are associated with another word not included in the list. This word is commonly known as the <b>critical</b> <b>item.</b> Results show that, when asked to recall or recognize the list words, participants often report the <b>critical</b> <b>item.</b> The variables that contribute for such false memories are many and varied, and have been investigated by several authors (e. g., Deese, 1959 b; Roediger & McDermott, 1995). In this study we explored the effect of lists in which the first half of the words was associated with one <b>critical</b> <b>item,</b> and the second half was associated with another <b>critical</b> <b>item.</b> This manipulation was justified by the fact that previous studies showed that the order of the words in the lists is critical for the appearance of a false memory (e. g., Brainerd, Payne, Wright, & Reyna, 2003 a). On the other hand, two additional critical variables, the activation of the <b>critical</b> <b>item,</b> according to the activation-monitoring theory (Roediger, Balota, & Watson, 2001), and identifiability of the theme of the list, according to the fuzzy trace theory (Reyna & Brainerd, 1995), occurred twice in the lists that we used. This feature allowed us to understand the role of encoding and retrieval mechanisms in the appearance and monitoring of false memories. In the first study, we conducted four experiments in which we manipulated the words that comprised the two halves of the lists, as well as the type of association strength (forward or backward) between them and the <b>critical</b> <b>item.</b> We found that in all experiments the <b>critical</b> <b>item</b> associated with the words presented in the first half of the lists was more often (falsely) recalled than the <b>critical</b> <b>item</b> associated with the second half. Having established the relevance of the variable half of the list, in a second study we manipulated the backward associative strength of the list words with respect to the <b>critical</b> <b>item.</b> This manipulation was justified by the fact that several studies identified this variable as the strongest predictor of recall of the <b>critical</b> <b>item</b> (e. g., Gallo & Roediger, 2002). To this end, we created a set of lists in which the backward associative strength of the words remained constant in the first half of the lists, but varied in the second half of the lists. We found that as the associative strength of the second half of the list increased, the recall rate of the <b>critical</b> <b>item</b> associated with that half also increased. In addition, the recall rate of the <b>critical</b> <b>item</b> associated with the words presented on the first half did not change significantly. These results are consistent with the hypothesis advanced in the first study according to which, in the DRM paradigm, the place in the list (first or second half) where the words associated with the <b>critical</b> <b>item</b> occur is an important determiner of the probability of a false memory. Taken together, our findings can be explained in the light of the two theories previously referred, although none of them provides a full explanation of the data. According to the activationmonitoring theory, the prominence of the first half of the lists may be due to the fact that there is better monitoring of the false memories associated with the second half of the lists because the words that comprise the second half of the lists are the last to be presented, the participants are instructed to begin recall by the end of the lists, and, finally, less time elapsed between the end of the lists and their recall. According to the fuzzy trace theory, the advantage of the first half of the lists may be due to the fact that the extraction of the theme of the list is most likely to occur while the first words of the lists are being presented. The extracted theme would then inhibit the extraction of the theme associated with the second half of the list, and consequently lower recall rates of the corresponding <b>critical</b> <b>item.</b> The results seem to support the hypothesis that there is an interaction between backward associative strength and theme identifiability, highlighting the importance of semantic and associative relationships, respectively, for the occurrence of false memories in the DRM paradigm (e. g., Cann, McRae, & Katz, 2010; McRae, Khalkhali, & Hare, in press). O estudo das memórias falsas é importante por dois motivos. Primeiro, a análise das memórias falsas e das circunstâncias que conduzem ao seu aparecimento ajudam a compreender o funcionamento da própria memória. E segundo, em determinados contextos aplicados (por exemplo, judiciais), a ocorrência de uma memória falsa pode ter efeitos devastadores. Se a compreensão do normal funcionamento da memória esteve na origem dos primeiros estudos sobre os erros mnésicos, o impacto social que a ocorrência de memórias falsas assumiu em alguns casos mediáticos acabou por ter um papel muito importante no desenvolvimento e na afirmação desta área de estudos dentro da psicologia. A forma como as memórias falsas têm sido estudadas varia de acordo com o paradigma teórico em que os investigadores se baseiam. No caso do paradigma DRM, paradigma que serviu de base à realização deste estudo, o procedimento consiste na apresentação de listas de palavras que estão associadas a uma outra palavra não apresentada, comummente designada por item crítico. O que se verifica é que o item crítico tende a ser evocado e reconhecido como se de uma palavra das listas se tratasse. As variáveis que concorrem para a intrusão do item crítico, ou seja, para a memória falsa, são múltiplas e de natureza diversa, e têm sido objecto de investigação por parte de muitos autores (e. g., Deese, 1959 b; Roediger & McDermott, 1995). Neste estudo explorámos o efeito de listas de palavras em que a primeira metade estava associada a um item crítico e a segunda metade a outro item crítico. Esta manipulação justificava-se pelo facto de, em estudos prévios, a ordem de apresentação das palavras nas listas se ter mostrado uma variável relevante (e. g., Brainerd, Payne, Wright, & Reyna, 2003 a). Por outro lado, duas outras variáveis relevantes, a ativação do item crítico segundo a teoria da ativação-monitorização (Roediger, Balota, & Watson, 2001), e a identificabilidade do tema das listas segundo a teoria do traço difuso (Reyna, & Brainerd, 1995), estariam duplamente presentes na codificação e na recuperação destas listas, permitindo perceber qual o papel dos mecanismos de codificação e de recuperação no aparecimento e na monitorização das memórias falsas. Num primeiro estudo, realizámos quatro experiências em que manipulámos a composição das listas, designadamente, as palavras que compunham a primeira metade e a segunda metade das listas, assim como o tipo de associação, direta ou retrógrada, que estas palavras tinham com o item crítico. Constatámos que, em todas as experiências, o item crítico associado às palavras apresentadas na primeira metade das listas era mais evocado do que o item crítico associado à segunda metade. Depois de termos observado a relevância para a evocação do item crítico da variável metade da lista, num segundo estudo manipulámos também a força associativa retrógrada das palavras das listas em relação ao item crítico. Esta manipulação justificava-se pelo facto de esta variável ser apontada por vários estudos como o melhor preditor da evocação do item crítico (e. g., Gallo & Roediger, 2002). Para tal, criámos listas em que a força associativa retrógrada das palavras apresentadas permanecia constante na primeira metade das listas, mas variava na segunda metade. Verificámos que o aumento da força associativa das palavras apresentadas na segunda metade das listas conduziu a um aumento na taxa de evocação dos itens críticos associados a essas palavras, mas não produziu uma diminuição nas taxas de evocação dos itens críticos associados às palavras apresentadas na primeira metade. Estes dados corroboraram a hipótese levantada no primeiro estudo de acordo com a qual a metade de apresentação das palavras nas listas é uma variável importante para o aparecimento de memórias falsas neste paradigma. No seu conjunto, os resultados que obtivemos podem ser interpretados à luz das duas teorias explicativas das memórias falsas no paradigma DRM, embora nenhuma das teorias os explique completamente. De acordo com a teoria da ativação-monitorização, a proeminência da primeira metade das listas advém do facto de haver uma melhor monitorização das memórias falsas associadas à segunda metade das listas, uma vez que, sendo apresentadas em último lugar, e sendo dadas instruções aos participantes para começarem a evocação pelo fim das listas, decorre menos tempo entre a sua apresentação e a sua evocação. De acordo com a teoria do traço difuso, a supremacia da primeira metade das listas poderá ser devida ao facto de a extração do tema das listas ocorrer sobretudo durante a apresentação das primeiras palavras das listas, o que conduziria a uma inibição da extração do tema associado à segunda metade das listas e, consequentemente, a menores taxas de evocação do item crítico. Os resultados parecem apoiar a hipótese de que há uma interação da força associativa retrógrada e da identificabilidade do tema, realçando a importância das relações associativas e semânticas, respetivamente, na formação das memórias falsas no paradigma DRM (e. g., Cann, McRae, & Katz, 2010; McRae, Khalkhali, & Hare, no prelo) ...|$|E

This report documents the results of that comparison for the Orbiter BFS hardware. The IOA product for the BFS analysis consisted of 29 failure mode worksheets that resulted in 21 Potential <b>Critical</b> <b>Items</b> (PCI) being identified. This product was originally compared with the proposed NASA BFS baseline and subsequently compared with the applicable Data Processing System (DPS), Electrical Power Distribution and Control (EPD and C), and Displays and Controls NASA CIL items. The comparisons determined if there were any results which had been found by the IOA but were not in the NASA baseline. The original assessment determined there were numerous failure modes and potential <b>critical</b> <b>items</b> in the IOA analysis that were not contained in the NASA BFS baseline. Conversely, the NASA baseline contained three FMEAs (IMU, ADTA, and Air Data Probe) for CIL items that were not identified in the IOA product...|$|R
