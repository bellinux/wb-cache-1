50|$|Dry-ground mica {{is used in}} the {{production}} of rolled roofing and asphalt shingles, where it serves as a surface coating to prevent sticking of adjacent surfaces. The coating is not absorbed by freshly manufactured roofing because mica’s platy structure is unaffected by the acid in asphalt or by weather conditions. Mica is used in decorative coatings on wallpaper, concrete, stucco, and tile surfaces. It also is used as an ingredient in flux coatings on welding rods, in some special greases, and as coatings for core and mold release compounds, facing agents, and mold washes in foundry applications. Dry-ground phlogopite mica is used in automotive brake linings and clutch plates to reduce noise and vibration (asbestos substitute); as sound-absorbing insulation for coatings and polymer systems; in reinforcing additives for polymers to increase strength and stiffness and to improve stability to heat, chemicals, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation; in heat shields and temperature insulation; in industrial <b>coating</b> <b>additive</b> to decrease the permeability of moisture and hydrocarbons; and in polar polymer formulations to increase the strength of epoxies, nylons, and polyesters.|$|E

Three types of cigarette filter rods, namely, triethyl citrate-cellulose acetate (TEC-CA) filter rods, triethyl citrate-cellulose acetate-paper (TEC-CA-paper) dual filter rods and cellulose acetate-paper-triethyl citrate (CA-paper-TEC) dual filter rods, were manufactured. In order to promote the curing of CA rods, high-frequency radiation was introduced into the procedure of filter manufacture.

30|$|Several {{chemicals}} {{are listed as}} POP by the Stockholm Convention. These compounds usually share {{a high degree of}} halogenation. Among them are some organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and –furans (PCDD/F), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), hexabromobiphenyl (HBB), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) or perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). Some POP are unintentionally formed, e.g. PCDD/F by combustion of chlorine-containing substrate or as by-products of industrial processes. Others were intentionally produced for applications as pesticides or industrial chemicals, e.g., PCB as heat exchange fluid or additive in paints and plastics, PFOS as <b>coating</b> <b>additive,</b> or HBCD, HBB, and PBDE as flame retardants [49]. Production or applications of POP are regulated or restricted; however, market demands often require adequate replacements. For example, bis(2 -ethylhexyl)-tetrabromophthalate (BEHTeBP) and 2 -Ethylhexyl- 2, 3, 4, 5 -tetrabromobenzoate (EHTeBB) were used to replace PentaBDE. Decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) or Dechlorane Plus (DP) were introduced as alternative for DecaBDE [47, 58]. Although such substitutes might not meet all POP criteria, they often share properties as those substances they were designed to replace and thus might be similarly harmful to the environment or to humans. Therefore, it is not only important to monitor classical POP but also to investigate their substitutes or compounds with (anticipated) POP-like properties.|$|E

40|$|A {{review is}} given on {{transport}} and equilibrium sorption of moisture in polymer films and organic coatings. Polymeric material forms the continuous {{phase of a}} coating and is therefore important for transport properties. Besides polymer, coatings consist of pigments and fillers and various additives, each of them affecting moisture transport. Firstly, in this paper typical transport and equilibrium characteristics of pure polymer films are covered, and secondly those of coatings, assimilating the impact of pigments, fillers and additives. Discrimination between Fickian and non-Fickian effects is usually based on the appearance of kinetic absorption curves. Several types of curve are dealt with, and models that describe these curves are discussed. These include `two-stage' sorption, `sigmoidal' sorption and `Case II' sorption. The common practice of fitting Fick's law to kinetic data by means of relaxation parameters is criticized. Transport kinetics is modelled {{on the basis of}} kinetic plots, thereby introducing relaxation parameters in Fick's diffusion law. Although these models describe moisture transport in polymers reasonably, these models imply a lot of `curve-fitting', without a clear mechanistic foundation. Equilibrium sorption of moisture in polymeric systems is reflected by their sorption isotherms. Type II and III isotherms of the BET classification are commonly encountered, together with linear isotherms according to Henry's law. The suitability of porous media adsorption models for polymeric systems is discussed. These models are treated in relation to interactions of water in polymers, since localized binding of water to specific groups may justify the use of these models.

FT-IR and SEM analyses of the microparticles revealed that the eicosane infiltrated and coated the fine aerogel particles but the microparticles still remained in the powder form. The nanoporous aerogel structure held the infiltrated eicosane while the ultra-high specific surface area of silica aerogel kept the surrounding eicosane in situ by surface tension. Infrared thermal imaging showed that the eicosane did not drip out from the microparticles even at 120 °C, whereas the pure PCM completely changed phase to fluid when heated.

To prepare the antimicrobial coating on leather surfaces with high potency against microbes, photoactive agents, such as benzophenone (BP), 4, 4 ’-bis(dimethylamino) benzophenone (MK), 4, 4 ’-dihydroxybenzophenone (DHBP) and methylene blue (MB), were incorporated into polyurethane-based coating solutions. The photoactive antimicrobial agent treated leather samples were characterized by SEM, color appearance, color fastness against abrasion, and antimicrobial tests. The optical properties of organic photosensitizers indicated that active UV absorbance ranges were different: BP (around 250 nm), MK (around 360 nm), DHBP (around 305 nm) and MB (around 295 nm & 570 nm- 685 nm). The intensity of the UV absorbance curve at the UVA light wavelength for the antimicrobial test showed the highest value with MK; subsequently, this was followed by MB, DHBP and BP in decreasing order. The treated-leather samples demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity under UVA light. The antimicrobial effects for the Staphylococcus aureus were superior to Escherichia coli.

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, the {{industry}} (including scientists) has focused on diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating because of its wide range of application in various fields. This material has numerous applications in mechanical, electrical, tribological, biomedical, and optical fields. Severe friction and wear in some machine parts consumes high amount of energy, which makes the process energy inefficient. Thus, DLC coating {{can be an effective}} means to lower the friction and wear rate. Some important process variables that affect the tribological characteristics of DLC coating are adhesion promoter intermediate layer, substrate surface roughness, hydrogen incorporation or hydrogen non involvement, and coating deposition parameters (e. g., bias voltage, etching, current, precursor gas, time, and substrate temperature). Working condition of DLC-coated parts also affects the tribological characteristics, such as temperature, sliding speed and load, relative humidity, counter surface, and lubrication media (DLC additive interaction). Different types of lubricated oils and additives are used in engine parts to minimize friction and wear. DLC can be coated to the respective engine parts; however, DLC does not behave accordingly after coating because of lubricant oil and additive interaction with DLC. Some additive interacts positively and some behave negatively because of the tribochemical reactions between DLC coating and additives. Numerous conflicting views have been presented by several researchers regarding this <b>coating</b> <b>additive</b> interaction, resulting in unclear determination of true mechanism of such interaction.
