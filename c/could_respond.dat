5|$|In {{the first}} round, Jennings {{was finally able}} to choose a Daily Double clue, while Watson responded to one Daily Double clue {{incorrectly}} {{for the first time in}} the Double Jeopardy! Round. After the first round, Watson placed second for the first time in the competition after Rutter and Jennings were briefly successful in increasing their dollar values before Watson <b>could</b> <b>respond.</b> Nonetheless, the final result ended with a victory for Watson with a score of $77,147, besting Jennings who scored $24,000 and Rutter who scored $21,600.|$|E

5|$|Sprint was {{the primary}} weapon of Nike-X as {{originally}} conceived; {{it would have been}} placed in clusters around the targets being defended by the MAR system. Each missile was housed in an underground silo and was driven into the air before launch by a gas-powered piston. The missile was initially tracked by the local MSR, which would hand off tracking to the MAR as soon as it became visible. A transponder in the missile <b>could</b> <b>respond</b> to signals from either the MAR or MSR for accurate tracking.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} {{games in the}} series, Wipeout 64 was {{developed}} by Liverpudlian developer Psygnosis and was published by Midway Games - marking {{the first and only}} time in the Wipeout series where one of the games were not published by Psygnosis or SCE Studio Liverpool (their future name). The game {{is one of the few}} N64 titles to have noticeable load times, disguised by the request 'Please Wait'. Load times between levels in Wipeout 64 are approximately a few seconds long due to the need for sound decompression, according to Psygnosis in a later interview with IGN. Psygnosis used the Nintendo 64's analogue stick to their benefit; thus rendering the D-Pad obsolete so that ships <b>could</b> <b>respond</b> quickly and more precisely in improvement regarding to the older games.|$|E
5|$|Despite having bested the Romans {{in their}} battles, Pyrrhus had {{sustained}} heavy casualties. With his Italian allies wavering, Pyrrhus decided {{to abandon his}} campaign against Rome. At this point in time, Pyrrhus had two options available. Firstly, he could return to Greece where the throne of Macedon had been left vacant {{by the death of}} King Ptolemy Keraunos {{at the hands of the}} Gallic invaders of Greece. Pyrrhus had coveted the Macedonian throne and had briefly held it from 287 BC to 285 BC. Alternatively, he <b>could</b> <b>respond</b> to the appeal of the Greek poleis of Sicily which were requesting his assistance to combat Carthaginian aggression.|$|E

5|$|A {{subcommittee}} of the S-1 Executive Committee, chaired by James B. Conant, and consisting of himself, Arthur Compton and Harold Urey, was appointed {{to look into the}} issue, and it similarly assessed the danger as low, but still sufficient to warrant taking some precautions. A program was initiated by the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago and the Victoreen Instrument Company in Cleveland to develop radiation detection devices suitable for use in the field. Some 48 portable detection meters were built in 1943, half of which were capable of detecting 0 to 10 roentgens per day, while the other half could detect from 0 to 100 roentgens per day. Instruments sets were stored at Manhattan District offices in Boston, Chicago, New York City, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., and the area engineer and some other officers were instructed in their use. A special team of scientists was created at the Metallurgical Laboratory who <b>could</b> <b>respond</b> to any reports of the use of nuclear weapons or radioactive poisons.|$|E
5|$|By December 1409 Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas {{had agreed}} on a common strategy: Their armies would unite into a single massive force and march {{together}} towards Marienburg (Malbork), capital of the Teutonic Knights. The Knights, who took a defensive position, did not expect a joint attack and were preparing for a dual invasion—by the Poles along the Vistula River towards Danzig (Gdańsk) and the Lithuanians along the Neman River towards Ragnit (Neman). To counter this perceived threat, Ulrich von Jungingen concentrated his forces in Schwetz (Świecie), a central location from where troops <b>could</b> <b>respond</b> to an invasion from any direction rather quickly. Sizable garrisons were left in the eastern castles of Ragnit, Rhein (Ryn) near Lötzen (Giżycko), and Memel (Klaipėda). To keep their plans secret and mislead the knights, Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas organised several raids into border territories, thus forcing the knights to keep their troops in place.|$|E
5|$|Following several stages won by sprinters and {{breakaway}}s, {{the next}} {{test for the}} riders was the legendary Alto de El Angliru in Stage 13. The morning breakaway was afforded over eleven minutes, but it was dropped to nothing on the ascent {{of what has been}} called the most difficult climb in all of professional cycling. Astana and Caisse d'Epargne both had many support riders in the leading group going up the climb, and they alternately tried to set paces to protect either Contador or Alejandro Valverde while isolating the competition. It was left to Leipheimer to pace Contador to the conclusion as the climb reached its hardest part, 7 kilometers from the finish. Contador indeed {{went on to win the}} stage, and took the race lead as well. Contador added another stage win the next day when only he and Leipheimer <b>could</b> <b>respond</b> to the repeated attacks of Ezequiel Mosquera, and Contador won the sprint.|$|E
25|$|Most North Koreans had {{experienced}} nutritional deprivation {{long before the}} mid-1990s.

5|$|The chase {{continued}} through a second night, the French frigate making significant gains over her pursuers but {{still unable to}} escape them completely. At 10:30 on 10 February, two sails appeared in the southeast, set on a course that would cut {{in front of the}} French frigate. These were the British frigate HMS Horatio under Captain George Scott and the brig HMS Driver. With enemies on all sides, Rousseau recognised that his only hope of escape lay in defeating Horatio: a swift victory would enable him to outrun pursuit from the east, travelling westwards into the Atlantic. Rapidly closing with the new arrivals, Junon opened fire at 12:36. Horatio immediately responded and then circled the slower French vessel and raked her before Rousseau <b>could</b> <b>respond.</b> Drawing close, the frigates exchanged broadsides at point blank range for 40 minutes. The heavier weight of the French ship soon told, with Scott and his first lieutenant severely wounded and their masts badly damaged. Unable {{to keep up with the}} French frigate, whose hull was badly holed but whose masts were only lightly damaged, Horatio fell back.|$|E
25|$|When EPA {{first began}} operation, {{members of the}} private sector felt {{strongly}} that the environmental protection movement was a passing fad.

25|$|Despite {{centralized}} {{policies and}} practices, the captains {{who ran the}} precincts or districts were relatively independent of headquarters, owing their jobs to neighborhood politicians. Decentralization meant that police <b>could</b> <b>respond</b> to local concerns, but graft often determined which concerns got most attention. In 1895, Chicago adopted civil service procedures, and written tests {{became the basis for}} hiring and promotion. Standards for recruits rose, though policing remained political.|$|E
25|$|Some strategies, such as {{prescribed}} burns, have complicated ramifications due to conflicting evidence. Some {{claim that}} fires have {{negative effects on}} EcM survival and diversity, while other show neutral, or even positive effects. Clearly, different organisms and different community structures will react to such burns differently. With that in mind, these diverse effects are to be expected, and research on how specific communities <b>could</b> <b>respond,</b> rather than sweeping generalizations, {{would be much more}} beneficial in the long run.|$|E
25|$|Reports {{surfaced}} of People's Republic of China J-6s (MiG-19s) flying combat missions during infrequent border squabbles {{with the}} Soviets, though with no records of dogfights, and encounters during the Vietnam War with U.S. aircraft that strayed into Chinese airspace.

Waubonsie jumped on the boat, killed the lone American on board, and leapt off before the Americans on the far shore <b>could</b> <b>respond.</b> Waubonsie, Shabonna, and Winamac led Potawatomi warriors against Harrison's troops at the Battle of Tippecanoe on November 7, 1811.|$|E
25|$|Recognizing that juries {{in capital}} cases found {{discretion}} in sentencing desirable, Tennessee, Alabama, and Louisiana afforded their juries this discretion in the 1840s. Finally, the jury <b>could</b> <b>respond</b> to mitigating factors {{about the crime}} or the criminal and withhold the death penalty even for convicted first-degree murderers. This development spread, and by 1900 23 {{states and the federal}} government had discretionary sentencing in capital cases. Fourteen more states followed in the first two decades of the 20th century, and by 1963 all death-penalty jurisdictions employed discretionary sentencing.|$|E
25|$|Several {{security}} issues {{were resolved by}} Microsoft for MDAC 2.7.
