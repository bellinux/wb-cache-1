5|$|In the wild, the diets of Campbell's dwarf hamsters vary {{across the}} {{population}} range. A total of 51 {{different species of}} plants were identified to be <b>consumed</b> <b>by</b> the Transbaikalia population, the most common being Stipa capillata and species of Allium. However, in Tuva, only 10 species of plant were identified to be <b>consumed</b> <b>by</b> the population, the most common being Potentilla. Campbell's dwarf hamster is a natural predator of burrowing worms and grubs.|$|E

Of the five who ate the fungus, two had gastrointestinal symptoms including stomachache, flatulence, and diarrhea; the other three did not have symptoms. The large European bird great bustard (Otis tarda) has been recorded feeding on the puffball.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} large numbers of organisms {{actually}} <b>consumed</b> <b>by</b> the walrus, its foraging has a large peripheral impact on benthic communities. It disturbs (bioturbates) the sea floor, releasing nutrients into the water column, encouraging mixing and movement of many organisms and increasing the patchiness of the benthos.|$|E

50|$|The Pacific leaping blenny (Alticus arnoldorum), {{also known}} as the leaping rockskipper, is a species of combtooth blenny (family Blenniidae) in the genus Alticus. The {{blennies}} are oviparous, and form distinct pairs when mating. Males can reach a maximum total length of 8 centimetres (3.15 inches). These fish feed primarily on benthic algae, which they <b>consume</b> <b>by</b> scraping off rocky surfaces.|$|R

5|$|These toxic {{mushrooms}} resemble several edible species (most notably caesar's mushroom and {{the straw}} mushroom) commonly <b>consumed</b> <b>by</b> humans, increasing {{the risk of}} accidental poisoning. Amatoxins, the class of toxins found in these mushrooms, are thermostable: they resist changes due to heat and so, their toxic effects are not reduced by cooking.|$|E

5|$|Adult mockingbirds {{can fall}} victim to birds of prey such as the great horned owl, screech owl and sharp-shinned hawk, though their {{tenacious}} behavior makes them less likely to being captured. Scrub-jays also have killed and eaten mockingbirds. Snakes rarely capture incubating females. Fledgelings have been prey to domestic cats, red-tailed hawks, and crows. Eggs and nestlings are <b>consumed</b> <b>by</b> blue jays, fish crows and American crows, red-tailed hawks, swallow-tailed kites, snakes, squirrels, and cats. Blowfly larvae and Haemoproteus {{have been found in}} Florida and Arizona populations, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} recognized {{as an integral part}} of the river otter's diet. Otters consume more aquatic insects in the summer as the populations increase and specific life stages heighten their susceptibility. Most aquatic invertebrates preyed upon by the otters are from the families Odonata (dragonfly nymphs), Plecoptera (stonefly nymphs), and Coleoptera (adult beetles). Invertebrates discovered within scats or digestive tracts could most likely be a secondary food item, first being <b>consumed</b> <b>by</b> the fish that are subsequently preyed upon by the otters.|$|E
