40|$|Abstract:- Defects inside {{insulation}} of HV XLPE <b>cable</b> <b>accessories</b> {{can lead}} to partial discharge (PD) activity. When PD activity happens, leakage current may flow through the grounded line. To acquire the PD current signal, one practicable and effective method is placing a high frequency current transformer (HFCT) winding the grounded line. In order to measure the insulation degradation, a partial discharge on-line monitoring system is developed and reported in this paper. Through the field test, the presented monitoring system is effective and available for power cable in the condition based maintenance (CBM). However, on-site partial discharger detection on XLPE cables and <b>cable</b> <b>accessories</b> are very difficult of variable noise interference, which gives much trouble to partial discharge detecting. This paper introduced an adaptive filter stationary-non stationary filter based on the wavelet transform (WTST-NST) to de-noise the stationary noise interference in partial discharge detecting. The proposed method is a wavelet domain filtering technique, based on the iterative multi-resolution decomposition reconstruction (MRD-MRR) with hard threshold, for extracting PD signals from stationary interference noise. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the experimental results, while using the WTST-NST filter to PD signals recorded from power cables, prove {{that the ability to}} extract the PD from noise hidden in it...|$|E

40|$|On-site PD {{measurements}} on HV cables have {{to concentrate on}} the <b>cable</b> <b>accessories</b> because there is a remaining risk for assembling faults on site. PD sensors with an appropriate coupling behavior to accessory-internal PD give sensitivities of a few pC or even better. Unfortunately, two main reasons prevent the general use of PD sensors in <b>cable</b> <b>accessories.</b> First of all, the costs for PD sensors have to be balanced with the costs of the accessories, importance of the cable link, consequential costs for outages etc. This is the reason why PD sensors were mainly used for EHV cable systems. The second reason is limited accessibility: the PD sensor cable at the accessory has to be connected to a PD detection unit. Accessibility is much more difficult for direct buried cable systems than for cable terminations and for tunnel-laid cable systems: the sensor cable must pass the ground and end up in a box on the surface to provide access. This solution causes additional costs and new problems like sealing the sensor cable against humidity, capability to withstand sheath testing etc. By looking for alternative access to PD signals from cable joints of long cable systems, a very simple solution proved suitable: detecting PD at the cross-bonding links. To investigate the high frequency propagation of PD pulses in cross-bonding links, computer simulations and laboratory measurements were done. On-site PD measurements at cross-bonding links of a 220 -kV-XLPE cable system showed unexpected hig...|$|E
