5|$|Tyler {{cuts from}} Charlotte's buttocks, frying {{a strip of}} her flesh on a stove. Squires tells of how he began an affair with Monica, Tyler's wife and mother of his twin children, {{destroying}} Tyler's career. Tyler hands Squires the flesh, and he eats, fearing Charlotte will die. Tyler reveals how he hates cryptic crosswords, and how his son entered the Cambridge Crossword Competition, attempting to beat his mother's new husband: Squires. Squires realises that Charlotte is Tyler's daughter. <b>Charlotte</b> <b>and</b> Tyler sought revenge on Squires, but Tyler changed plans so Squires would include clues in the crossword. However, Simon's autopsy—Tyler explains—revealed that Simon and Charlotte were actually Squires's children, meaning Monica and Squires's relationship began earlier than he previously thought. Charlotte is past saving, and Tyler places a bullet on Squires's desk, quoting Chekhov's gun. Squires confirms that his middle name is Hector as he weeps over <b>Charlotte,</b> <b>and</b> Tyler circles something on the crossword. Charlotte is dead, and Squires loads the gun, placing it in his mouth. Blood splatters over the crossword and a second nina: RIP NHS.|$|E

5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was first signed in 1919, M-50 started at an {{intersection}} with M-23 (present-day US12) in Cambridge Junction, south of Brooklyn. From there it {{ran to the}} southeast, similar to its present-day routing, through Dundee and Tecumseh into downtown Monroe where it intersected M-56. There was a concurrency between M-50 and M-65 between Dundee and the Ida area which became an overlap with US23 after 1926. By the end of 1927, M-50 underwent a major lengthening as its western terminus was extended through Jackson to Eaton Rapids, <b>Charlotte,</b> <b>and</b> Vermontville before intersecting M-39 just east of Woodbury. From this point, M-50 was routed over M-39 to US16 near Alto. M-50 then ran concurrently with US16 into Grand Rapids where it turned {{to the west and}} traveled through Allendale before terminating at a junction with US31 in Agnew. A few years later in 1929, the route between <b>Charlotte</b> <b>and</b> Woodbury was changed as M-50 was routed north out of Charlotte to the former M-39 and replaced it east to Woodbury; the former routing was turned over to local control.|$|E
