40|$|The Supreme <b>Court</b> has <b>ushered</b> {{in the new}} {{millennium}} with a renewed emphasis on federalism-based limits to Congress 2 ̆ 7 s regulatory authority in general, and Congress 2 ̆ 7 s Section 5 power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment in particular. In a recent string of cases, the Court has refined and narrowed Section 52 ̆ 7 s enforcement power in two significant ways. 1 First, the Court made clear that Congress lacks the authority to interpret the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s substantive provisions themselves, and may only 2 ̆ 2 enforce 2 ̆ 2 the judiciary 2 ̆ 7 s definition of Fourteenth Amendment violations. 2 Second, the Court embraced a relatively stringent requirement concerning the relationship between means and ends, ruling that 2 ̆ 2 [t]here must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end. 2 ̆ 23 Within the past three years, the Court has applied these standards governing Congress 2 ̆ 7 s Section 5 enforcement to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 4 the Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification Act, 5 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. 6 And just last month, the Court applied these same standards to invalidate the Violence Against Women Act in United States v.

40|$|The legal {{homosexual}} {{has undergone}} a dramatic transformation {{over the past three}} decades, culminating in United States v. Windsor, which struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). In 1986, the homosexual was a sexual outlaw beyond the protection of the Constitution. By 2013, the homosexual had become part of a married couple that is “deemed by the State worthy of dignity. ” This Article tells the story of this metamorphosis in four phases. In the first, the “Homosexual Sodomite Phase,” the United States Supreme Court famously declared in Bowers v. Hardwick that there was no right to engage in homosexual sodomy. In the second, the “Equal Homosexual Class Phase,” the Court in Romer v. Evans cast the legal homosexual {{as a member of a}} “class of citizens” whose exclusion from anti-discrimination protections the Constitution could not tolerate. In the third, the “Free Intimate Bond Phase,” the Court shifted its focus in Lawrence v. Texas to an enduring intimate bond involving private sexual acts protected from government intrusion. In the fourth and current phase, the “Dignified Married Couple Phase,” the Court in United States v. Windsor validated the decision of several states to “confer” upon homosexuals “a dignity and status of immense import. ” The heart of the Article is an analysis of this final phase. Although Windsor is an important civil rights victory, the <b>Court’s</b> opinion <b>ushers</b> in important consequences for the legal homosexual. In the process of dignifying the same-sex couple, the Court erased the terms “homosexual” and “lesbian,” cast marriage as an elevated moral state, and, most importantly, promoted a concept that the Article calls a “weak dignity. ” Windsor’s dignity is weak in three ways. First, human dignity was not understood by the Court as inherent in all humans. The Court instead assumed that the State confers dignity upon individuals. Second, Windsor’s concept of dignity is much narrower than theories promoted by contemporary moral and legal philosophers. Third, Windsor adopted a rhetoric of injury and pity that presents all those in same-sex relationships and their children as the wounded and humiliated victims of DOMA. The Article concludes with suggestions on how advocates and courts applying Windsor can employ the concept of equal dignity while moving beyond Windsor’s weaknesses...|$|R
40|$|In {{the more}} than 200 years in which formal {{organizations}} of workers (labor unions) have existed in the United States, {{there have been three}} distinct eras of policy toward them. Initially, in the late 18 th and early 19 th century, they were regarded as associations that came under the purview of the English common-law doctrine of conspiracy—that is, their very existence could be considered illegal, regardless of the objectives of the group. The first significant departure from that doctrine came in 1842, in a Massachusetts court. In Commonwealth v. Hunt, the conspiracy doctrine was rejected. That decision generally was accepted in other state <b>courts,</b> and it <b>ushered</b> in a period of neutrality with respect to the very presence of an organization of workers. The specific acts of labor organizations were still actionable, but not the existence of the organization itself. However, the law did not provide protection or encourage labor organizations. This posture became the status quo for nearly a century until the 1930 s, when public policy shifted in the direction of offering an explicit mechanism to facilitate worker organization, while providing protection for such groups once they came into being. The changes were embodied in the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, popularly known as the Wagner Act. With the passage of this legislation, the present era of public protection of labor unions was created. Why this happened, {{and its impact on the}} American economy, are the subjects of this article...|$|R

50|$|Chambonnières's {{wife died}} in the early 1650s. He married his second wife Marguerite Ferret, {{daughter}} of a law <b>court</b> <b>usher,</b> on 16 December 1652.

A series of concerts titled Assemblée des honnestes curieux was given in the mid-1650s; those given in autumn 1655 were attended by Christiaan Huygens. Chambonnières's dancing career continued, too: on 23 February 1653 he danced in the Ballet royal de la nuit, {{side by side with the}} young Louis XIV and Jean-Baptiste Lully, and on 14 April 1654 he participated in the ballet inserted into Carlo Caproli's opera Le nozze di Peleo e di Theti.

5000|$|After {{the judge}} has summed up the case, the <b>court</b> <b>usher</b> swears to keep the jury in some [...] "private and {{convenient}} place", {{to prevent them from}} speaking to anyone else and not to speak to them himself [...] "except it be to ask them if they are agreed upon their verdict." [...] The usher then becomes the jury bailiff, and stations himself outside the jury room during the deliberations. The jury may send a note to the judge to ask a question of law or for the judge to read to them a transcript of some of the evidence. It is a contempt of court for a juror to disclose, or for anyone else (including the press) to enquire into, the nature of the jury's deliberations.
