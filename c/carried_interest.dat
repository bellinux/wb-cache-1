Standard approaches are not able to resolve which of the competing analogies is better and often fail even to recognize that there are competing analogies.

6000|$|The {{interest}} of debt contracted {{during the war}} is stated by the author at 2,614,892l. The particulars appear in pp. 14 and 15. Among them is stated the unfunded debt, 9,975,017l., supposed to carry interest on a medium at 3 per cent, which amounts to 299,250l. We are referred to the [...] "Considerations on the Trade and Finances of the Kingdom," [...] p. 22, for the particulars of that unfunded debt. Turn to the work, and to the place referred to by the author himself, {{if you have a}} mind to see a clear detection of a capital fallacy of this article in his account. You will there see that this unfunded debt consists of the nine following articles: the remaining subsidy to the Duke of Brunswick; the remaining dédommagement to the Landgrave of Hesse; the German demands; the army and ordnance extraordinaries; the deficiencies of grants and funds; Mr. Touchet's claim; the debts due to Nova Scotia and Barbadoes; exchequer bills; and navy debt. The extreme fallacy of this state cannot escape any reader who will be at the pains to compare the interest money, with which he affirms us to have been loaded, in his [...] "State of the Nation," [...] with the items of the principal debt to which he refers in his [...] "Considerations." [...] The reader must observe, that of this long list of nine articles, only two, the exchequer bills, and part of the navy debt, carried any interest at all. The first amounted to 1,800,000l.; and this undoubtedly <b>carried</b> <b>interest.</b> The whole navy debt indeed amounted to 4,576,915l.; but of this only a part <b>carried</b> <b>interest.</b> The author of the [...] "Considerations," [...] &c. labors to prove this very point in p. 18; and Mr. G. has always defended himself upon the same ground, for the insufficient provision he made for the discharge of that debt.
