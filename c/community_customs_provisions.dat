40|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made by the East African Community partner states in implementing the East African <b>Community</b> <b>customs</b> union. Trade within the East African Community is now free from import duties, and partner states have adopted a three-band common external tariff. This paper assesses how the customs union has supported intraregional trade and industrialization, in particular through the development of competitive smokestack-free industries. It concludes that regional integration has provided a support environment for the development of smokestack-free industries, but significant opportunities still exist within the region. Recommendations are provided on what should be done to harness these opportunities...|$|R

Unfortunately, this was interpreted by many in the Italian community as the Irish having relegated them to the cellar. This was a contributing factor in the Italian community organizing to build their own church.|$|R

The Sugar Act, or American Revenue Act, of April 1764 was the first from the Parliament at Westminster to explicitly state that its purpose was not merely to regulate trade but to raise revenue, and, toward this end, the Act established a vice admiralty court in Halifax for the purpose of cracking down on alleged smugglers evading <b>customs.</b> <b>Provisions</b> were so scarce during the winter of 1775 that Quebec had to send flour to feed the town.

The Mark II was a substantial upgrade from its predecessor in both offensive and defensive capabilities.

An unknown number of unique [...] "reflector bits" [...] are stored in its backpack. A <b>custom</b> <b>provision</b> for the Psyco Mark II, these weapons are not armed like conventional bits, but instead allow the Psyco's pilot to redirect incoming beam weapons away from it, or to bounce attacks from its own weapons at otherwise impossible trajectories. Finally, the Mark II is fitted with a detachable head (another throwback to the Zeong), allowing its pilot to escape if the main body becomes damaged or inoperable.|$|R

These legal documents envisage the methods of determination of customs value: the primary ones, {{which are based on}} the transaction value, but also the secondary ones, which are based on other methods for determination of customs value of goods. The customs services of the EU Member States have on their disposal six methods for determination of customs value of goods. Those methods in the mentioned acts of the EU and Serbia are transposed from the Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 and Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994. The fact that mentioned acts of the EU and Serbia request that the customs value of goods must be clearly and precisely determined, that means to be determined in the same way, is understandable because the customs base {{is one of the most}} significant elements of customs. There are many reasons for that: in a certain way, the customs base is in relation with all other elements of customs structure; from the procedure in which the customs base is determined, that means from its universality depends the amount of income which will the EU and Serbia, on that ground, collect to finance public expenditure predicted in the budget; and most of the customs on the imported goods in the EU is determined ad valorem...|$|R
