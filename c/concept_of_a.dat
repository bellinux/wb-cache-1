5|$|Alton Towers {{conceived}} the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flying roller coaster in 1990, twelve years before Air eventually opened. Following {{the opening of}} Nemesis in 1994, a flying coaster was planned by the park to open in 1998, but was delayed due to technological limitations. During its development, Alton Towers marketed the ride as Secret Weapon 5 (abbreviated to SW5), following the naming pattern established for previous major park developments. The ride was developed in part by ride designer John Wardley, the producer of many attractions at Alton Towers and other former Tussauds Group theme parks.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{the first}} form of graph duality to be {{recognized}} was the association of the Platonic solids into pairs of dual polyhedra. Graph duality is a topological generalization of the geometric concepts of dual polyhedra and dual tessellations, and is in turn generalized algebraically by the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dual matroid. Variations of planar graph duality include a version of duality for directed graphs, and duality for graphs embedded onto non-planar two-dimensional surfaces.|$|E
