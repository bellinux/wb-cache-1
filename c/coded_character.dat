The Registrar works with a Joint Advisory Committee (JAC) in developing and implementing the standard. The JAC contains six members: the Registrar, one member from the Library of Congress, one from Standards Norway, one from the French Encyclopaedia Universalis, an officer of Unicode, {{and a member of}} Unicode. These individuals represent the interests of the ISO 15924 RA, the ISO 639-2 RA, ISO Technical Committee 37, ISO Technical Committee 46, and the ISO <b>Coded</b> <b>Character</b> Set Sub-Committee, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to Unicode, {{support for}} sampi in {{electronic}} encoding was marginal. No common 8-bit codepage for Greek (such as ISO 8859-7) contained sampi. However, lowercase and uppercase sampi were provided {{for by the}} [...] Greek alphabet <b>coded</b> <b>character</b> set for bibliographic information interchange. In Beta code, lowercase and uppercase sampi are encoded as [...] "#5" [...] and [...] "*#5" [...] respectively. In the LaTeX typesetting system, the [...] "Babel" [...] package allows accessing lowercase and uppercase sampi through the commands [...] "\sampi" [...] and [...] "\Sampi". Non-Unicode (8-bit) fonts for polytonic Greek sometimes contained sampi mapped to arbitrary positions, but usually not as a casing pair. For instance, the [...] "WP Greek Century" [...] font that came with WordPerfect had sampi encoded as 0xFC, while the popular [...] "Wingreek" [...] fonts had it encoded as 0x22. No encoding system prior to Unicode 5.1 catered for archaic epigraphic sampi separately.|$|E
2500|$|The V2, V3, and V4 {{proposals}} {{were developed by}} a group at the Han-Nom Research Institute led by Nguyễn Quang Hồng. V4, developed in 2001, includes over 400 ideograms formerly used by the Tay people of northern Vietnam. This allows the Tay language to get its own registration code. V5 {{is a set of}} about 900 characters proposed in 2001. As these characters were already part of Unicode, the IRG concluded that they could not be edited and no Vietnamese code was added. (This is despite the fact that national codes were added retroactively for version 3.0 in 1999.) The Nom Na Group, led by Ngô Thanh Nhàn, published a set of nearly 20,000 Nom characters in 2005. This set includes both the characters proposed earlier and a large group of additional characters referred to as [...] "V6". These are mainly Han characters from Trần Văn Kiệm's dictionary which were already assigned codepoints. Character readings were determined manually by Hồng's group, while Nhàn's group developed software for this purpose. The work of the two groups was integrated and published in 2008 as the Hán Nôm <b>Coded</b> <b>Character</b> Repertoire.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Container code {{examination}} is {{an essential}} step in the container flow management. To date, this step is mostly achieved by human visual inspections, which are however time-consuming and error-prone. We hence propose a new computer vision system for automated container code recognition. The proposed system consists of model construction and code recognition stages. In the model construction stage, we first incorporate a locally thresholding method with prior knowledge of <b>code</b> <b>character</b> geometry to segment the <b>code</b> <b>characters,</b> including English characters A-Z and numeric characters 0 - 9, from a training set of container images. With the segmentation results of each character, we subsequently construct its Eigen-feature model using the principal component analysis (PCA). In the recognition stage, the <b>code</b> <b>characters</b> are firstly segmented from the given container image. Each segmented character is then recognized by finding the best matched Eigen-feature model that maintains the minimal PCA reconstruction error of the character appearance. Experiments showed that the proposed method achieved the code recognition with a high recognition rate and little recognition time for each image automatically. Overall, our proposed system has great potential for improving the efficiency of container terminals as well as enhancing the container management.
