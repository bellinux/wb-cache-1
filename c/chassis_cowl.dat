5000|$|Generally it was {{supplied}} {{as a light}} {{delivery van}} with sliding doors, {{but it was also}} available as a <b>chassis</b> with <b>cowl</b> upon which specialist bodywork could be added. [...] The Bedford Dormobile was a Campervan conversion based on the Bedford CA van.|$|R
50|$|The 3300 is {{sold as a}} <b>cowled</b> <b>chassis,</b> {{intended}} primarily for conventional-type (type C) school buses, also available with Maxxforce7 and MaxxforceDT engines until 2015 and now uses Cummins diesel and Power Solutions International propane engines.|$|R
50|$|Nelson was {{inducted}} into the West Coast Stock Car Racing Hall of Fame and is credited with many innovations still in use today in racing. Roof flaps, power steering, generation 5 NASCAR <b>chassis,</b> <b>cowl</b> flaps, are a few.|$|E
5000|$|The {{same year}} Chevrolet merged with GM, Durant wanted a pickup {{to compete with}} the new Ford Model TT. The answer was two models, the first 1918 Chevrolet Series 490 Light Delivery <b>chassis</b> <b>cowl</b> rated at half a ton and based on the {{passenger}} car. The second, not based on the 490, was a one-ton 1918 Chevrolet Model T (oddly enough) [...] "Ton Truck" [...] shared with GMC. It had a payload capacity rating of 2,000 lbs and sold for $1245 retail. Much like the chassis cab of today, they gave consumers a cheap, flexible platform to build on. Its steering wheel and gear shift lever, along with the instrument panel and gauge cluster, were also lifted from the passenger car. A <b>chassis</b> <b>cowl</b> included the chassis with engine, transmission and the front sheet metal which comprised the hood, front fenders, headlights and grille.|$|E
50|$|All SCAM {{vehicles}} are 4x4 with {{right or left}} hand drive, and are available with 3.5 tons and 5.5 tons chassis (chassis or crew cab). A 7.5 ton version is in development. Available models {{are based on the}} Iveco Daily Van, cabin cruiser, Combi, Minibus, Agile (with automatic gearbox), and CNG, most in all-wheel-drive. Also available is a <b>chassis</b> <b>cowl</b> i.e. the frame with drivetrain but without cab for special applications.|$|E
50|$|The Freightliner FS-65 is a Type C {{conventional}} bus chassis that was manufactured by Freightliner from 1997 to 2007. Used {{primarily as a}} <b>cowled</b> <b>chassis</b> for school bus applications, the FS-65 was developed from the Freightliner FL-Series medium-duty conventional.|$|R
50|$|While a {{bare chassis}} {{instead of a}} <b>cowled</b> <b>chassis,</b> the 3900/3000 {{maintained}} mechanical commonality with the 3800 conventional. This included shared powertrain and suspension components, while interior parts included Navistar instrument panels and steering columns. The 3800 itself {{was based on the}} International 4700/4900.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, the Vision {{made its}} debut for 2004 {{production}} (the Conventional remained solely on Navistar chassis, becoming the SBCV in 2005). Upon {{the introduction of the}} Vision, Blue Bird became the first American body manufacturer to design a <b>cowled</b> <b>chassis</b> for its bus bodies; previously, in-house chassis were reserved for transit-style school buses.|$|R
5000|$|The CA {{was a huge}} seller both at {{home and}} in various {{overseas}} markets. The standard panel van was available in short- and long-wheelbase forms, and was also sold as chassis cab / <b>chassis</b> <b>cowl,</b> and became a popular basis for ice-cream vans, ambulances and camper vans. Known affectionately as [...] "the Tilley", the CA enjoyed a very long production span, with only minor tweaks throughout its life, including the replacement of the two piece windscreen of earlier models with a single sheet. Production ended in 1969.|$|E
50|$|In 1997, Freightliner began {{producing}} the Business Class for bus applications; the Freightliner FS-65 <b>cowled</b> <b>chassis</b> is produced primarily for school bus use. Additionally, the Business Class was also produced as a cutaway cab for non-school bus bodies. Following {{the acquisition of}} Thomas Built Buses in 1998, the FS65 was bodied by Thomas exclusively after 2001.|$|R
50|$|After {{the sale}} of the General Motors P-chassis to Navistar {{subsidiary}} Workhorse in 1998, the Type B bus configuration largely began to disappear. In their place, cutaway versions of Class 4-5 trucks began to appear; various school buses utilized Chevrolet/GMC C4500 and International 3200 cutaway cabs. In 2006, IC Bus introduced the BE200, the first Type B bus with a fully <b>cowled</b> <b>chassis</b> (a scaled-down Type C body).|$|R
5000|$|The Chevrolet and GMC B-series is {{a series}} of <b>cowled</b> <b>chassis</b> that were {{produced}} by General Motors, primarily fitted with school bus bodies throughout its production. Based on the medium-duty (Class 6-7) trucks produced by the Chevrolet and GMC divisions of General Motors, the B-series was produced in three separate generations; GMC initially produced its own version separate from Chevrolet. Introduced in 1966, the B-series was redesigned in 1984 and 1993.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-2000s, IC saw {{a number}} of changes. As Navistar {{introduced}} its first all-new <b>cowled</b> <b>chassis</b> since 1979 with the International 3300 (a cowled-chassis variant of the International 4300/Durastar), IC introduced a new-generation CE-Series in 2005. In 2006, the BE-Series was a second IC-bodied bus based on the 3300; although similar in configuration to the CE, the flat-floor low-profile BE was designed for users of smaller buses; its highest capacity was 30 passengers.|$|R
5000|$|The International Harvester S-Series [...] "Schoolmaster" [...] is a Type C (conventional) {{bus chassis}} that was {{manufactured}} by International Harvester and then Navistar International from 1979 to 1989. In 1989, the S-Series was updated and renamed the International 3800. It was used {{primarily as a}} <b>cowled</b> <b>chassis</b> for both school bus and commercial bus applications; it also {{was the basis for}} the front and rear-engine stripped chassis that International uses for bus applications as well.|$|R
5000|$|Although not {{the first}} to {{introduce}} the type, in the 1930s, Wayne Works was among the first manufacturers to produce transit-style school buses; a body with a more or less flat front-end design. Initial production of Wayne's [...] "forward control" [...] bus bodies were conversions of conventional bus chassis. However, the [...] "conventional" [...] design, with a <b>cowled</b> <b>chassis</b> (known as Type C on modern school buses) would be the bulk of Wayne's sales until production ended in 1992.|$|R
5000|$|The IHC S-Series was {{produced}} {{in a number of}} variants {{for a wide variety of}} applications, including straight trucks, semitractors, vocational trucks, and severe-service trucks. Additionally, the S-Series {{was produced}} in other body configurations, including a four-door crew cab, cutaway cab, <b>cowled</b> <b>chassis,</b> and a stripped chassis (primarily for school buses). The chassis was produced with both gasoline and diesel powertrains (the latter exclusively after 1986), single or tandem rear axles, and two, four, or, six-wheel drive layouts.|$|R
50|$|Freightliner {{offers two}} {{variants}} of the M2 for bus use: the C2/S2 <b>cowled</b> <b>chassis</b> and the S2C cutaway cab bus chassis. Serving as the donor chassis for the Thomas Saf-T-Liner C2 school bus constructed by Freightliner subsidiary Thomas Built Buses, the C2 chassis departs from previous precedent in its higher parts commonality with the M2 106 truck. Forward of the driver's seat, the dashboard {{is used in}} its entirety, and while it was a redesigned (larger) piece of glass, the windshield allows {{the use of the}} stock Freightliner windshield wipers.|$|R
50|$|Throughout its production, the S-Series {{would be}} used as a <b>cowled</b> <b>chassis</b> for bus manufacturers. While used {{primarily}} for yellow school buses in the United States and Canada, the S-Series also was used outside of North America as a basis to produce other types of bus bodies. Introduced in 1979, the bus variant of the S-Series {{would be one of the}} final models designed by International Harvester before its transition to Navistar. In 1989, the S-Series bus chassis was rechristened the 3000-Series with the fitment of the new-generation Navistar cowl.|$|R
5000|$|... 1955: {{a number}} of new models were added. The 6-226 model lineup gained {{stripped}} <b>chassis,</b> flat face <b>cowl,</b> cowl/windshield, and ambulance models. The 475 line received only the cowl/windshield. Willys withdrew from the passenger car market and renamed the vehicle the Utility Wagon. The seventh seat and the overdrive were deleted, and the Planardyne front suspension used with the two-wheel drive wagon was replaced with a beam axle. Warn hubs, with which the front drive mechanism could be disengaged by turning the hubs by hand, became optional on four-wheel drive models.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} {{traditional}} conventional-style <b>cowled</b> <b>chassis,</b> International produced several stripped-chassis variants for transit-style school buses. Using many chassis and powertrain components from the S-Series, the front-engine 1853FC (FC=Forward Control) was produced from 1981 to 1981. Unlike the conventional, it was powered exclusively by diesel engines. In 1990, the 1853FC {{was replaced by the}} more advanced 3900. As with its predecessor, it again shared powertrain and chassis components with its conventional counterpart. In fixing a key drawback of the 1853FC, the 3900 would significantly reduce the interior space needed for the engine, freeing up space for the driver's compartment and front stairwell. The 3900 was produced until 2010.|$|R
5000|$|Aside {{from the}} sale to Freightliner, the {{discontinuation}} of the B-Series was also heavily influenced by factors affecting school bus body manufacturers. During the 1990s, the practice of customers choosing <b>cowled</b> <b>chassis</b> separate from the body manufacturer began to fade as body manufacturers, {{in order to stay}} competitive, entered into supply agreements or were purchased outright by chassis suppliers. In 1992, General Motors and Blue Bird Corporation entered into a 10-year contract to supply the B7 chassis exclusively; other chassis became an extra-cost option. AmTran and Thomas Built Buses were purchased outright in 1995 and 1998 by truck manufacturers Navistar and Freightliner, respectively. As the GM/Blue Bird contract expired in 2003, Ford sought a supply agreement with the company, leading to a few prototypes based on the all-new F-650 Super Duty; it did not lead to a production vehicle. As a result, Blue Bird designed the Type C Vision chassis in-house and once again Ford was left without potential customers for any chassis orders after the non-compete agreement had expired.|$|R
