50|$|An NBC (nuclear, biological, <b>chemical)</b> <b>suit</b> {{is a type}} of {{military}} personal protective equipment designed to provide protection against direct contact with and contamination by radioactive, biological or chemical substances, and provides protection from contamination with radioactive materials and some types of radiation, depending on the design. It is generally designed to be worn for extended periods to allow the wearer to fight (or generally function) while under threat of or under actual nuclear, biological, or chemical attack. The civilian equivalent is the Hazmat suit. The term NBC has been replaced by CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear), {{with the addition of a}} new threat, radiological, meaning radiological weapon.|$|E

The alarm kept going off in our hotel. This was back when we thought Saddam had chemical weapons and was willing to use them.” Also, he wrote {{about the death of}} his friend and colleague Andrew Breitbart, whom he memorialized as “a partisan warrior and a guerrilla theater aficionado - half right wing Yippie, half Andy Kaufman.... Breitbart had the brains, the talent, and the animal charisma to get people to set cars on fire for him, or to run off with him to the desert where he might start his own anti-Obama doomsday cult. But while he believed in what he espoused, perhaps a little too much, he was also in it for other reasons - for action, and for amusement. He didn’t just hit scandal head-on. He enjoyed coming at it slyly. He gloried in the art of presentation.” ...|$|E
50|$|Brian eavesdrops on Meddows and {{learns that}} the Blob is a {{biological}} warfare experiment created during the Cold War, launched into space {{because it was}} so dangerous. Learning that the Blob has entered the sewers, Meddows decide to trap it there, even if that means allowing Meg, Kevin, and Eddie to die. Brian is discovered listening in and evades military personnel by driving his motorcycle into the sewers. In the sewers, Meg and Kevin flee from the Blob when it emerges and devours Eddie. Kevin escapes by scaling a pipe to the surface, and Meg is saved by Brian, who confronts Meddows in front of the townsfolk and Briggs. After failing to convince everyone Brian is contaminated and must die, Meddows attempts to shoot him, but is killed by the Blob as it oozes into his <b>chemical</b> <b>suit</b> and drags him into the sewer. Then the Blob feasts upon the population, impervious to the military's attempts to stop it. The town's Reverend Meeker proclaims the scene to be the prophesied end of the world, after which a failed flamethrower attack on the Blob sets him ablaze. Meg saves him with a fire extinguisher, and in the process blasts the Blob with it. When the monster backs off, she realizes that the Blob cannot tolerate cold.|$|E

40|$|A {{cutting edge}} man-portable AVMEC cooling garment was {{demonstrated}} {{to be able}} to provide sufficient cooling for personnel working at mediate activity loads. Studies were first carried out in a well controlled vacuum desiccator at room temperature to elucidate the effects of several key parameters on the performance of an AVEC device, which was similar to AVMEC except that membrane was not involved. Under the best condition, an average cooling capacity of 179 W/M 2 was achieved in a period of four hours and cooling continued at a slowly declining rate for another four hours afterward. The temperature of water was maintained at approximately 12. 5 oC after the pseudo steady state was established. Then, it was shown that the AVMEC cooling pads were able to provide a cooling capacity of 277. 4 W/m 2 in a 37 oC ambient environment (incubator). The temperature of the cooling core surface was maintained in a range of 20 – 21. 8 oC in the one-hour test period. No power supply was required except for the initialization stage, which took 5 minutes. Furthermore, human subject tests with or without wearing NWBC (Nuclear Warfare Biological and <b>Chemical)</b> <b>suit</b> demonstrated that, a AVMEC garment composed of 12 cooling pads were able to maintain the core body temperature of the subjects below 38. 5 oC for up to 90 minutes while the subject was walking on a treadmill at a speed of 2 miles per hour in an environment of 40 oC and 50 % RH (relative humidity). These results indicate that the AVMEC garment is a promising man-portable personal cooling technology...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{workers are}} often {{required}} to wear protective <b>chemical</b> <b>suits</b> while working outdoors in the heat. The {{purpose of this}} study was to quantify heat exposures by obtaining thermal data inside <b>chemical</b> <b>suits.</b> A secondary aim was to validate the effectiveness of Lascar sensors as a means to estimate wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT). Lascar thermal data loggers were used to collect personal (inside the suit) and positional thermal data. A conventional Quest Temp heat stress monitor was used to verify the accuracy of WBGT predictions made from Lascar data. It was concluded that ambient data could be used to predict thermal conditions inside a Simplair A. E. Tank Suit (C-suit) and that Lascar data loggers can be used to predict WBGT values from humidity and temperature data. The Lascar loggers are small and can be worn inside protective clothing...|$|R

Transport {{of chemicals}} through {{the wall of a}} hose occurs {{in the same manner as}} through gloves and <b>chemical</b> <b>suits,</b> driven by the chemical concentration gradient, but for air-supply hoses the chemical evaporating inside the air-supply hose is inhaled. A simple method based on the mathematical equivalence of filling a hose with a chemical to immersing it in a chemical has been developed. The method requires a short section of hose to be filled, plugged and weighed at intervals to determine the breakthrough time and permeation rate per meter. The method has been validated experimentally and calculations show that permeation through the walls of a hose can dominate the respiratory dose, particularly with a hoseNo Full Tex...|$|R
