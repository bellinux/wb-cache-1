40|$|Replacing a non-restorable maxillary premolar with an implant {{has always}} been a {{clinical}} challenge. This article shows how a good outcome was obtained in five cases by following a new protocol using an immediate implant and an immediate provisional restoration, followed by a definitive screw-retained computer-assisted design and <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>manufacturing</b> (CAD/CAM) zirconia abutment crown. Using this technique, the clinician can replace the tooth immediately, preserve hard and soft tissue architecture, and achieve a good esthetic outcome. The screw-retained zirconia abutment crown eliminates the abutment-to-crown interface and allows retrievability for esthetic improvement and maintenance...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{clinical}} outcomes achieved with <b>Computer-Assisted</b> Design/Computer-Assisted <b>Manufacturing</b> implant abutments in the anterior maxilla. Material and Methods: Nineteen patients with a mean age of 41 (range form 26 to 63) years, treated with 21 single tooth implants and 21 <b>Computer-Assisted</b> Design/Computer-Assisted <b>Manufacturing</b> (CAD/CAM) abutments in the anterior maxillary region were included in this study. The patients followed 4 criteria of inclusion: (1) had a single-tooth implant in the anterior maxilla, (2) had a CAD/CAM abutment, (3) had a contralateral natural tooth, (4) the implant was restored and in function for at least 6 months up to 2 years. Cases without contact point were excluded. Presence/absence of the interproximal papilla, inter tooth-implant distance (ITD) and distance from the base of the contact point to dental crest bone of adjacent tooth (CPB) were accessed. Results: Forty interproximal spaces were evaluated, with an average mesial CPB of 5. 65 (SD 1. 65) mm and distal CPB of 4. 65 (SD 1. 98) mm. An average mesial ITD of 2. 49 (SD 0. 69) mm and an average distal ITD of 1. 89 (SD 0. 63) mm were achieved. Papilla was present in all the interproximal spaces accessed. Conclusions: The restoration of dental implants using CAD/CAM abutments is a predictable treatment with improved aesthetic results.

30|$|Recently, {{dispensing}} (e.g., inkjet printing) {{technology has}} {{attracted much attention}} {{for use as a}} tool to fabricate structures consisting of various cell types [11 – 15]. Because the dispensing technology can make a precise cell pattern directly by dispensing small droplets of biological materials containing living cells, it has advantages of simplicity and flexibility for fabrication of complex cellular structures. The dispensing technology is flexible to pattern various designs by simply controlling the position to dispense living cells in droplets from a nozzle. Furthermore, because the dispensing technology can be easily integrated with <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>manufacturing</b> systems, it can use solid free-form fabrication to precisely form complex 3 D cellular structures [16, 17]. Also, it can form cellular structures that consist of different cell types by using and controlling multiple nozzles, each with a corresponding reservoir [5].|$|E
40|$|Guided by {{theories}} of “management by exception,” we study {{the impact of}} information and communication technology on worker and plant manager autonomy and span of control. The theory suggests that information technology is a decentralizing force, whereas communication technology is a centralizing force. Using a new data set of American and European manufacturing firms, we find indeed that better information technologies (enterprise resource planning (ERP) for plant managers and <b>computer-assisted</b> design/computer-assisted <b>manufacturing</b> for production workers) are associated with more autonomy and a wider span of control, whereas technologies that improve communication (like data intranets) decrease autonomy for workers and plant managers.

40|$|For {{the better}} part of the past 20 years, {{dentistry}} has seen the development of many new all-ceramic materials and restorative techniques fueled by the desire to capture the ever elusive esthetic perfection. This has resulted in the fusion of the latest in material science and the pen ultimate in <b>computer-assisted</b> design/computer-assisted <b>manufacturing</b> (CAD/CAM) technology. This case report describes the procedure for restoring the esthetic appearance of both the left and right maxillary peg-shaped lateral incisors with a metal-free sintered finely structured feldspar ceramic material using the latest laboratory CAD/CAM system. The use of CAD/CAM technology makes it possible to produce restorations faster with precision- fit and good esthetics overcoming the errors associated with traditional ceramo-metal technology. The incorporation of this treatment modality would mean that the dentist working procedures will have to be adapted in the methods of CAD/CAM technology...|$|R
40|$|Background. Fracture load of implant-supported restorations is an {{important}} factor in clinical success. This study evaluated the effect of two techniques for screw access hole preparation on the fracture load of cement-screw-retained implant-supported zirconia-based crowns. Methods. Thirty similar cement-screw-retained implant-supported zirconia-based maxillary central incisor crowns were evaluated in three groups of 10. Group NH: with no screw access holes for the control; Group HBS: with screw access holes prepared with a machine before zirconia sintering; Group HAS: with screw access holes prepared manually after zirconia sintering. In group HBS, the access holes were virtually designed and prepared by a <b>computer-assisted</b> design/computer-assisted <b>manufacturing</b> system. In group HAS, the access holes were manually prepared after zirconia sintering using a diamond bur. The dimensions of the screw access holes were equal in both groups. The crowns were cemented onto same-size abutments and were then subjected to thermocycling. The fracture load values of the crowns were measured using a universal testing machine. Data were analyzed with ANOVA and Tukey test (P < 0. 05). Results. The mean fracture load value for the group NH was 888. 37 ± 228. 92 N, which was the highest among the groups, with a significant difference (P < 0. 0001). The fracture load values were 610. 48 ± 125. 02 N and 496. 74 ± 104. 10 Nin the HBS and HAS groups, respectively, with no significant differences (P = 0. 44). Conclusion. Both techniques used for preparation of screw access holes in implant-supported zirconia-based crowns de-creased the fracture load...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Surgical tooth {{extraction}} {{is a common}} procedure in dentistry. However, numerous extraction cases show {{a high level of}} difficulty in practice. This difficulty is usually related to inadequate visualization, improper instrumentation, or other factors related to the targeted tooth (e. g., ankyloses or presence of bony undercut). Methods. In this work, the author presents a new technique for surgical {{tooth extraction}} based on 3 D imaging, computer planning, and a new concept of <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>manufacturing.</b> Results. The outcome of this work is a surgical guide made by 3 D printing of plastics and CNC of metals (hybrid outcome). In addition, the conventional surgical cutting tools (surgical burs) are modified with a number of stoppers adjusted to avoid any excessive drilling that could harm bone or other vital structures. Conclusion. The present outcome could provide a minimally invasive technique to overcome the routine complications facing dental surgeons in surgical extraction procedures...|$|E
40|$|In the age {{of digital}} dentistry, virtual {{treatment}} planning is becoming an increasingly important element of dental practice. Thanks to new technological advances in the computer- assisted design and <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>manufacturing</b> (CAD/CAM) of dental restorations, predictable interdisciplinary treatment using the backward planning approach appears useful and feasible. Today, a virtual smile design {{can be used as}} the basis for creating an esthetic virtual setup of the desired final result. The virtual setup, in turn, is used to plan further treatment steps in an interdisciplinary team approach, and communicate the results to the patient. The smile design concept and the esthetic analyses required for it are described in this article. We include not only a step-by-step description of the virtual smile design workflow, but also describe and compare the several available smile design options and systems. Subsequently, a brief discussion of the advantages and limitations of virtual smile design is followed by a section on different ways to integrate a two-dimensional (2 D) smile design into the digital three-dimensional (3 D) workflow. New technological developments are also described, such as the integration of smile designs in digital face scans, and 3 D diagnostic follow-up using intraoral scanners...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{addition}} to functional goals, a satisfactory aesthetic outcome {{is important for}} reconstruction of fronto-orbital osseous defects. The {{purpose of this study}} is to report on a method for presurgical fabrication of custom implants using 3 -dimensional (3 -D) imaging data and <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>manufacturing</b> techniques. Methods: Preoperative 3 -D computed tomography data were processed and displayed for evaluation of defects. Implants were created by a computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) program. A rapid proto-typing system was applied for production of the physical models. Rehearsal of surgery was performed using the implants and skull models. Negative castings were created and were used during the operations to prepare the sur-gical implant utilizing methyl methacrylate. Traumatic fronto-orbital defects in 4 patients were reconstructed using this method. The follow-up period ranged from 29 to 55 months. Results: Results showed that the custom implants perfectly fit the defects during the operation. Symmetry and normal fronto-orbital contours were achieved. There were no peri- or postoperative complications. All patients were satis-fied with the results. Conclusions: Computer-aided presurgical simulation and fabrication of implants is a reli-able and effective method for the reconstruction of traumatic fronto-orbital defects, with reduced anesthesia time and improved aesthetic outcomes.

40|$|Major {{advances}} {{have been made}} in dental <b>computer-assisted</b> design and <b>manufacturing</b> (CAD/CAM) technology in recent years. New developments in intraoral optical scanning systems make it possible to rapidly obtain three-dimensional images and measurements of the jaw and entire quadrants, including the prepared teeth, neighboringteeth, and opposing dentition. In addition, the static relationship of the maxillary and mandibular teeth to one another can easily be determined by means of intraoral bite registrations or buccal scans. This information is the starting point for the implementation of digital occlusal surface design and surface reconstruction. Here, too, the knowledge-based concept of biogenerics has crystallized into a new method in which restoration proposals suitable for each individual case are automatically computed by the software. Consequently, the time required to manually edit the digital model has been significantly reduced or completely eliminated. In its current form, the digital workflow still lacks a strategy for integrating the dynamic occlusion into the restoration design with high precision and in atime-saving manner. The preliminary results of new digital concepts and approaches to solving this problem will be presented in this article...|$|R
40|$|CAD {{systems have}} greatly {{affected}} {{the way which}} engineers perform their function. Computers have simplified and eliminated many of repetitious tasks and the gap between computer models and physical products has significantly shortened. These tools have stimulated the impetus for product development but the manufacturing processes still depends on human skills which ultimately reduce errors and produce better products. Complex shapes representing the patient’s anatomy are widely applied, namely in <b>computer-assisted</b> surgery and <b>manufacturing</b> of customized implants. These type of models represent a challenge for the reverse engineering processes and are not comparable {{with the demands of}} regular geometric models. In order to create a replica, data is processed in a series of steps that transforms the initial data obtained from the physical model into a three dimensional digital model. Most commonly it is necessary to include filtering, segmentation, mesh smoothing and surface generation. These steps can strongly affect the accuracy of the model. It is therefore necessary to find a compromise between the finest accuracy and maximum deviation acceptable to reduce computer processing time and achieve the best model. This study shows an iterative and alternating process to produce more accurate complex geometry models...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Reconstruction of an oromandibular defect {{remains one}} of the most {{formidable}} surgical challenges faced by the reconstructive head and neck surgeon. The purpose of this study was to illustrate the added value of 3 D imaging and planning in oromandibular reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 41 -year-old dentate male patient with T 2 N 0 M 0 osteosarcoma of the mandible required segmental resection of the lateral mandible. In a virtual environment, the bony resection and reconstruction were planned preoperatively based on computed tomographic data of the head and neck and lower leg. Three custom-made templates designed in a <b>computer-assisted</b> design and <b>manufacturing</b> software package and materialized by a selective laser sintering process (DuraForm PA, 3 D Worknet, Ede, Netherlands) were used to transfer this planning to the operating theater. RESULTS: During the operative procedure, the 3 templates allowed for a rapid and accurate execution of the different surgical steps, ie, establishing the bony surgical margins and resection of the mandible (first template), cutting of the fibula while being pedicled to the leg (second template), and placement of the fibula to the donor site (third template). CONCLUSION: Computer-aided surgery and planning using the 3 -template method lead to an accurate and oncologically safe reconstruction of the mandibular geometry by eliminating intraoperative decision making, shortening ischemic time of the fibular graft, and shortening overall operative time...|$|R
40|$|Background: Computer-aided {{design and}} <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>manufacturing</b> (CAD/CAM) of cutting guides {{are now being}} used in mandibular {{reconstruction}} with fibular bone flaps. Improvements in guide design and accuracy are needed to increase the benefits to patients. Cutting guides have become popular, but fixation guides are rarely considered. Materials and methods: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether using a fixation guide would contribute to better accuracy in mandibular reconstruction. Mandibular segmental osteotomies and fibular reconstructions were performed using model surgery. Models were divided into two groups: without or with a fixation guide (n =  13 for each group). After reconstruction, the distances between reference points such as the condylion laterale (Cl), gonion, and mental tubercle (T) were measured and compared with those of the preoperative virtual plan. Deviations in final positions between the two groups were analyzed. Results: The mean deviations were 2. 61  mm (range 0. 05 – 7. 65  mm) and 2. 05  mm (range 0. 07 – 8. 52  mm) in the groups without and with a fixation guide, respectively. The overall results were significantly better when a fixation guide was used (p =  0. 03). Distances including the Cl reference points such as ClCl (p =  0. 02) and Cl–T (p =  0. 001) were particularly improved. Conclusions: Using a fixation guide together with a cutting guide makes mandibular reconstruction more accurate, particularly for positioning the Cl reference points. Therefore, when a CAD/CAM-produced cutting guide is used in preparation for surgery, it is recommended to use a fixation guide as well for more accuracy...|$|E
