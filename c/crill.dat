5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, <b>Crill</b> faced {{one of the}} toughest {{challenges}} of his career in handling 'the Tomes affair', which ultimately led to the United Kingdom Home Secretary Kenneth Clarke removing the Deputy Bailiff Vernon Tomes from office in 1992. Sir Peter received complaints from lawyers and the Jersey Law Society about Tomes' delays in producing reserved judgments. Prior to their appointments as Crown Officers, <b>Crill</b> and Tomes had been partners in the same legal practice. In 1990, the then Home Secretary David Waddington gave Mr Tomes six months to clear a backlog in judgment writing and in October 1991, Kenneth Baker gave him a further three months to rectify the delays. In March 1992, a senior home office official gave Tomes seven days to resign, prompting a delegation of Jersey politicians to travel to the Home Office to protest and a reversal of that ultimatum. In May 1992, however, Tomes was finally told he would be removed from office with effect on 1 July 1992, provoking a demonstration of 1,000 people in his support. Tomes was reported as saying that 'Sir Peter <b>Crill</b> has been the sole instigator behind this. I have warned him he will have no rest while he remains in office because I am determined now to enter the States and change the constitution'. Sir Peter [...] "called for the people of Jersey to consider the situation calmly". In 1993, Tomes successfully stood for elected office as a Senator in the States of Jersey but failed to bring about any constitutional reforms.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, Bailhache became Deputy Bailiff of Jersey, {{following}} the controversial {{removal from office}} of the previous Deputy Bailiff Vernon Tomes.

He was a judge of the Court of Appeal of Guernsey from 1995 to 2009.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crill</b> married Gail Dodd, a doctor, in 1953. They {{had three}} daughters. His pastimes {{included}} amateur dramatics, yachting and supporting Jersey's draghunt. Following {{his retirement in}} 1995, he was active in organizations promoting the culture of Jersey, including the Société Jersiaise and the Jersey Arts Centre. A practising Christian, from 1957 he sang in St Helier Church Chior and later Trinity Church. He was received into the Catholic Church in July 1995.|$|E
50|$|The lyrics for SNU's current Alma Mater {{were written}} by a {{committee}} in 1940. This committee was composed of Alice <b>Crill,</b> Hoyle Thomas, Marjorie Crooks, Kyle Crist, Dave McKibbon, and Madge Posey. The lyrics were revised by J. Michael Crabtree, Class of 1972, in 1986 to reflect the university's name change from Bethany Nazarene College to Southern Nazarene University. The tune used to accompany the lyrics is Annie Lisle, an 1857 ballad composed by H.S. Thompson.|$|E
50|$|From France, <b>Crill</b> {{crossed to}} England. He later {{wrote of the}} escape 'With {{hindsight}} we achieved very little except to confirm through the memorandum of the then Bailiff, Mr A.M. Coutanche, {{the state of the}} Island as regards food and heating. Coutanche had prepared a memorandum about the problems facing the Island and had handed it to the German authorities. It contained courageously a hint that if they failed to fulfil their obligations under the Geneva Convention that might be something to be levelled against them after the war'.|$|E
50|$|The Bailiff's {{powers of}} {{theatrical}} censorship were {{the subject of}} controversy during the term of office of Sir Peter <b>Crill</b> who refused permission for a visiting amateur theatre group to perform Howard Brenton's play Christie in Love and required changes to the staging of a production of Shakespeare's Coriolanus by the Tricycle Theatre Company to prevent an actor's naked buttocks being visible to the audience. On several occasions, however, 'he suggested {{that the role of}} chief censor should not lie with him, but should be at taken on by the elected members of the States'.|$|E
