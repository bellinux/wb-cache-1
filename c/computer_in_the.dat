5|$|The {{seeds of}} modern AI were planted by {{classical}} philosophers {{who attempted to}} describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols. This work culminated in {{the invention of the}} programmable digital <b>computer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1940s, a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.|$|E
5|$|An Itanium-based {{computer}} {{first appeared}} {{on the list of}} the TOP500 supercomputers in November 2001. The best position ever achieved by an Itanium2 based system in the list was #2 (while now all systems have dropped off the list), achieved in June 2004, when Thunder (LLNL) entered the list with an Rmax of 19.94 Teraflops. In November 2004, Columbia entered the list at #2 with 51.8 Teraflops, and there was at least one Itanium-based <b>computer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top 10 from then until June 2007. The peak number of Itanium-based machines on the list occurred in the November 2004 list, at 84 systems (16.8%); by June 2012, this had dropped to one system (0.2%), and no Itanium system remained on the list in November 2012.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of Windows Phone, Microsoft {{underwent}} a gradual rebranding of its product range throughout 2011 and 2012—the corporation's logos, products, services and websites adopted the principles and concepts of the Metro design language. Microsoft previewed Windows 8, an operating system designed to power both personal computers and tablet computers, in Taipei in June 2011. A developer preview was released on September 13, {{and was replaced by}} a consumer preview on February 29, 2012. On May 31, 2012, the preview version was released.

5|$|In December 1974 Bill Gates was {{a student}} at Harvard University and Paul Allen worked for Honeywell in Boston. They saw the Altair 8800 <b>computer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics and knew it was {{powerful}} enough to support a BASIC interpreter. They wanted {{to be the first to}} offer BASIC for the Altair computer, and the software development tools they had previously created for their Intel 8008 microprocessor based Traf-O-Data computer would give them a head start. While their friend, Paul Gilbert, was building the computer, Allen wrote a program that ran on a DEC PDP-10 time-sharing computer that simulated the 8008 system. He also modified DEC's macro assembler to produce the machine code for the 8008 microprocessor. The Traf-O-Data software could be written and debugged before the computer hardware was complete.|$|E
5|$|The Stamper brothers—Tim and Chris Stamper—founded the British {{video game}} {{companies}} Ultimate Play the Game and Rare. They first {{worked together on}} arcade conversion kits, which were licensed to companies, but later became developers for the ZX Spectrum home <b>computer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1980s. Chris programmed the games, while Tim designed the graphics. They found success as Ultimate with games including Jetpac and Knight Lore. The brothers founded Rare in the mid-1980s after reverse engineering the Nintendo Entertainment System to shift their focus to console development. They became Nintendo's first major Western developer, for whom they developed licensed games and ports. Over the next two decades, Rare enjoyed {{a close relationship with}} Nintendo and developed multiple major titles for the company, including Donkey Kong Country and GoldenEye 007. Microsoft acquired Rare in 2002, and the brothers left the company in 2006. After spending several years out of the public eye, the brothers are currently planning new ventures.|$|E
