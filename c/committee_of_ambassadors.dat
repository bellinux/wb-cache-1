Each will have a Ministerial spokesperson selected by the ACP Council with two alternate spokespersons. A parallel structure will be established at Ambassadorial level. Comment: Reports suggest that while the European Commission has agreed that an all-ACP structure of negotiations should be maintained throughout the negotiations it is less than enthusiastic about conducting substantive negotiations on issues of common concern to the ACP at the all-ACP level. The Commission is keen to move as quickly as possible to regional level negotiations. This poses a major problem for the ACP. If the Commission is unwilling to enter into substantive discussions at the pan-ACP level on issues of common concern, then it will be extremely difficult to make progress on an ACP-EU framework agreement which could provide the basis for regional level negotiations. This could fracture the unity of the ACP and accelerate the timeframe within which individual ACP regions initiate regional level negotiations with the EU.

The support of the Dutch Authorities in the establishment of the Centre was acknowledged by Dr R D Cooke, CTA Director. Present; Dr Cooke drew attention to four aspects of changes in ACP States, i. e. the new players in the National Agricultural Systems, the changing role of information, the impact of new technologies and finally national and regional linkages for information management. His Excellency Mr C C Mamba, Ambassador of the Kingdom of Swaziland and President of the ACP <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ambassadors,</b> provided an overview of the challenges and opportunities for rural development in ACP countries, the Lome Convention playing a central role in increasing the momentum of development. Finally, Mr S Smidt, Director General of DG V 111, European Commission, expressed his conviction that the mandate of CTA is perfectly in line with one of the top priorities of the European Union's development cooperation, namely strengthening of knowledge and management capacities of ACP partners.

40|$|The {{architects of}} the large meeting room at the CTA {{headquarters}} got it right with the design of its castle-like walls with high slit-like windows; the light cascades in, sometimes blindingly, {{a constant reminder of}} the world outside. Small wonder then that topical issues such as poverty alleviation, environmental sustainability, gender strategies and the AIDS epidemic were high amongst the considerations of the 16 th meeting of the CTA Advisory Committee held from 5 to 8 June 2001 in Wageningen. The Advisory Committee is appointed by the ACP-EU <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ambassadors</b> to provide the Centre with advice on fulfilling its mandate. Composed of specialists from a total of thirty ACP and EU States, the Committee elects its officers from its own members, ensuring a parity of ACP and EU representation by rotating posts. The June meeting elected Mr J Flanagan (Eire) as its chairperson in succession to Ms T Ngomane (South Africa), and Mr J-P Toïhen (Benin) as vice chair. Two members were elected to Restricted Group: Ms H Boulkou (Greece) and Mr W Gibson (Trinidad and Tobago.) This group acts on behalf of the full Advisory Committee in between the annual meetings. The major tasks for the Advisory Committee were to comment on the Strategic Plan which had been developed following the Cotonou Agreement of June 2000, and its translation into a draft programme of activities, starting in 2002. CTA proposed that it should to work through three operational programmes, with support from planning and corporate services. The first programme would be known as the Information Products and Services Programme (IPSP) which pulls together the production and dissemination of information by CTA in printed and electronic form. The Communication Channels and Services programme would focus principally on promoting the use of electronic communication at the service of agriculture and rural development: radio, TV, Internet and electronic networks. The ICM Skills and Systems Programme would concentrate on providing training and integrated support to local and national organisations in ACP States on information and communication management. A provider and an enabler The task of CTA, Mr Flanagan told Spore, is to make available information and to help those who need it to use it. The problem, he said, is not the lack of information, since there is already much information in existence which is very useful for, for example, policy making or targeting the rural poor or achieving food security. The problem is that it is under-utilised, and the challenge is to make it known and make it available. With the increasing inclusion of information and communication technologies in agricultural information, it is important to strike a delicate balance between the new technologies (read: online, computer-linked) and their management on the one hand, and the old technologies of books and CD-ROMs. 'We have to be {{at the forefront of the}} new, and we cannot abandon the old' he emphasised, referring to the Centre s continuing role as a provider of information, and an enabler of information management. ' Both old and new have their place in CTA s future thrusts, he made clear, as do the more-established approaches practised by CTA of encouraging the exchange of information: study visits and seminars to name but two. For the Centre, the challenge is to adapt its obvious skills in networking to the context where ICTs are more important, and to assist its partners in tailor-making those ICTs, or customising them, and helping partners in the selection, management and communication of information and data. Similarly, the growing presence of NGOs and civil society organisations on the development stage requires that CTA will have to evolve its policies to meet their needs in a different way. Challenges galore, and a modern and clearly evolutionary approach to continuing to be of service; those are the bright lights which can back shine out of that meeting room to the world beyond.

40|$|Ms Tsakani Ngomane is Director for Regional Services in the Department of Agriculture, Land and Environment of the Northern Province of South Africa. She sees {{a central}} role for {{agricultural}} home economists {{in the struggle for}} gender equity in her nation's agriculture. Currently vice-chair of CTA's Advisory Committee, she is a clear voice in the 'post-Lomé' debate about relationships between the 71 ACP States and the European Union after the existing Lomé Convention expires early in 2000. As we try to define future co-operation and partnership options for EU and ACP States, we must emphasise the important role that women can play in agriculture. Basically survivors, women are central to the agenda as the primary processors and labourers in a sector still dominated by men. We have to make gender mainstream, and establish gender-sensitive management {{as an integral part of}} agricultural development initiatives. The EU's 'Green Paper' of September 1997 gave several opportunities for change, referring to new instruments and partnerships, and to more active participation by non-governmental players. It embraced several complementary objectives, including combating poverty, promoting sustainable development and the progressive integration of ACP agriculture into the world economy. Whilst urging economic growth through competition and private sector development through regional integration and trade development, the Paper tried to merge economic, environmental and societal interests, while respecting various stages of development of the ACP States ? that is, it sought to differentiate. The response of the ACP Group, in the Libreville Declaration of November 1997, called for greater unity and solidarity, and a focus on three priority areas: growth, competitiveness and employment; social and cultural policies; and regional integration. The guiding principles were institutional support and capacity building; a gender sensitive approach; and sustainable environmental management. This strategic position was reaffirmed in May 1998 by the ACP <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ambassadors,</b> and the ACP NGO Forum. Both emphasised the eradication of poverty, the promotion of gender equity in project cycles, and of women as participants and beneficiaries. One fundamental area where differentiation is not ? or should cease to be ? an issue is women in development. Targets have been set to ensure that gender issues are fully mainstreamed by 2000, but they will not be reached unless deliberate steps are taken to implement the guiding principles of co-operation. Correcting the obvious: targetting women I believe that correcting the obvious gender imbalance is the major entry point for developing social and economic empowerment programmes. Women, especially resource-poor rural women, are important stakeholders. In the agricultural sector alone, their productive roles surpass by far their reproductive role. As invisible actors in development, their contribution to socio-economic development and poverty alleviation is poorly understood and most often deliberately under-estimated. Globally, women produce more than half the food that is grown. In sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, they produce up to 80 % of basic foodstuffs but receive less than 5 % of extension resources. The importance of targeting the real clients in agricultural development whether on primary production, resource conservation, training, technology development, land matters, and access to credit cannot be overemphasized. It's not a power struggle Development institutions need to move away from regarding gender issues as a power struggle between men and women, because that is not the case. The question to ask is who is the primary client, the end-user of services provided? Responding to this question will shape our staffing policies, capacity building programmes, allocation of agricultural resources (land, farm inputs), development of appropriate technologies and extension service delivery strategies. The Post-Lomé debate provides clear guidance and direction for gender mainstreaming. I recognise gender issues as a cross ? cutting phenomenon which should be approached holistically within the larger context of agricultural development in general. However, leading institutions in the sector need to take deliberate steps to involve women at all levels if the target of 2000 is to mean anything real. Let us see more capable women at the policy-making level, more women extension officers and home economists in research stations, training institutions, on the farms in the villages, at the processing plant, the boardroom, yes, at all levels of the agricultural chain. Women: help the men! To the women out there 1, I urge you to reinforce our organisational efforts and assist our male partners in development to implement gender-sensitive management programmes. The agreements between the EU and ACP countries prove their commitment to ensure visibility of the role of women and of the potential to turn the poverty situation of ACP countries around. CTA's mandates in information management are aimed at improving access to technologies for increasing agricultural productivity, commercialisation, food security and rural development, as the Libreville Declaration stated. Central to these mandates is the empowerment of women in agriculture and rural development. We recently decided to strengthen CTA's work in the analysis of specific needs for supporting rural women's organisations, in the emphasis of extension services and in prioritising cooperation with institutions that have specific programmes on the role of women and poverty alleviation in agricultural and rural development. I hope this work addresses the issue of targeting the right client and will serve as an example for ACP national institutions to follow. 1 A recent readership survey showed that more than 90 % of Spore readers are male.
