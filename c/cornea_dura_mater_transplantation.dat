40|$|There is a {{high level}} of {{uncertainty}} surrounding the potential for iatrogenic prion transmission through transplantation, medical instrument reuse, blood transfusion, and blood product use {{due to a lack of}} evidence-based research on this important risk issue. A group of specialists was enlisted to evaluate some of the knowledge gaps in this area using the “Classical Model,” a structured elicitation procedure for weighting and pooling expert judgment. The elicitation exercise was undertaken in March 2009 with 11 transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) experts who were first calibrated using a series of seed questions for which the answers are known; they were then asked to answer a number of target questions that are important for risk assessment purposes, but for which there remains high uncertainty at this time. The target questions focused on variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD) prevalence, incubation times for vCJD, genetic susceptibility to prion disease, blood infectivity, prion reduction of blood and blood products, surgical instrument risks, and interspecies transmission of TSEs. The experts were also asked to perform pairwise risk rankings for 12 different potential routes of infection. <b>Dura</b> <b>mater</b> <b>transplantation</b> was seen as having the highest risk, while dental tissue grafts were viewed as presenting the lowest risk of iatrogenic transmission.

40|$|Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is {{the most}} common form of the human {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies. 1 The disease is characterised by rapid neurodegeneration leading to death within weeks to months. CJD is a rare disorder with an intriguing etiology, involving genetic and iatrogenic transmission. Ten to fifteen percent of patients with CJD are determined by mutations in the prion protein gene. 2 The clinical expression of these familial forms is highly variable and may range from a ‘typical’ CJD phenotype with rapid deterioration to a slowly progressive dementia mimicking Alzheimer’s disease. Apart from the causative mutations, a common polymorphism within the prion protein gene determines susceptibility to CJD. 3 Subjects who are homozygous for either allele of this polymorphism are at increased risk of CJD. There is growing evidence that this polymorphism further may influence clinical expression of CJD. Finally, the effect of the prion protein may extend to other forms of neurodegenerative disorders. Besides a role in rare diseases such as Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease and fatal familial insomnia, the gene may also have an effect on cognitive decline and dementia in the general population. Up to date, findings in this field have been inconsistent. The challenge for genetic epidemiology is to unravel the role of this gene in common neurodegenerative disorders. In about 5 % of patients with CJD, the disease has been caused by iatrogenic transmission. Unintended transmission of CJD occurred in various ways and has led in some instances to epidemics of the disease. 4 The most notorious epidemic started in the mid eighties and was due to human growth hormone administration. A second epidemic was related to <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> <b>transplantation.</b> The clinical phenotype of patients with the iatrogenic form of CJD may depend on the mode of transmission as well as on the prion protein genotype. As a consequence, for each new epidemic parameters like the minimum effective dosage and the range of the incubation time are to be assessed. Case studies of individual patients may help in establishing the phenotype of the disease, which may facilitate an early identification of cases and ultimately may prevent further transmission of disease from human to human...|$|R

40|$|Objective 　To {{investigate}} the diagnostic value of MRI in hypertrophic pachymeningitis (HP). Methods 　MRI images of 11 patients with HP were analyzed retrospectively. The characteristic {{signs of the}} MRI images, {{and the relationship between}} the MRI features and pathology of HP were reviewed. Results 　In the 11 cases of HP, involvement of cerebral <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> accounted for 8 cases, with spinal <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> involvement in 2, both cerebral and spinal <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> involvement in the other one case. The main sign of HP in MRI was an increased thickness of the <b>dura</b> <b>mater,</b> which showed iso-or hypointensity on T 1 WI without significant difference as compared with the brain parenchyma and spinal cord. The thickened <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> showed obviously low signal on T 2 WI, and it was recognized easily as compared with the brain parenchyma and the spinal cord. On the DWI of 9 cases who had cerebral <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> involvement, increased <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> showed lower signal, but it was not so distinct as shown on T 2 WI. On the post-contrast T 1 WI, the thickened <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> showed obvious enhancement, displaying better images than that of pre-enhancement image. Conclusion 　Among the different MRI techniques, T 2 -weighted imaging and post-enhanced T 1 WI have their advantages in the diagnosis of HP, and other MR imaging techniques could be complementary in increasing diagnostic accuracy and comprehensiveness.

40|$|PURPOSE: The <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> bioprosthesis was {{developed}} in the Department of Cardiopneumology of the Hospital das Clínicas of the University of São Paulo Medical School in 1971. Here, we present the clinical results of the <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> bioprosthesis over 30 years of follow-up. METHODS: We studied 70 consecutive patients who underwent mitral or tricuspid valve replacement with a <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> bioprosthesis between January 1971 and August 1972. RESULTS: The early mortality was 10 % (7 patients). The follow-up was 87 % complete (9 patients were lost to follow-up). Two patients were alive and asymptomatic 30 years after valve replacement; 33 patients underwent reoperations due to valve dysfunction, and 19 died during the follow-up period. At 30 years, the actuarial survival was 49. 2 ± 8. 6 %; freedom from rupture, 27. 0 ± 10. 2 %; freedom from calcification, 78. 8 ± 8. 6 %; and freedom from reoperation, 18. 8 ± 7. 5 %.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine whether residual tensile strains exist in the <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> of mammals in vivo, and whether the strains are age-dependent. We made incisions in the parietal <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> of immature and mature rats, and measured the retraction of the <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> from each incision. We then used a finite-element model to calculate the strain present in the parietal <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> of each rat. We found that age-dependent residual tensile strains are present in the <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> of rats. The mean average residual strain of the immature rats was significantly larger than that of the mature rats (4. 96 ± 1. 54 % (s. d.) versus 0. 39 ± 0. 13 %, p< 0. 0001), with the mean strain calculated in the mature rats of the order of the minimum measurement that could be made using our experimental approach.

40|$|In blind {{subjects}} who still have functional retinal ganglion cells, electrical stimuli {{applied to the}} optic nerve can produce localised visual sensations. This has been demonstrated with an intracranially implanted self-sizing spiral cuff electrode, but, to avoid skull opening, intra-orbital cuff implantation is now considered. In its orbital segment, the optic nerve is surrounded by subarachnoidal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and <b>dura</b> <b>mater.</b> <b>Dura</b> <b>mater</b> is a tough fibrous tissue that can impede electrical stimulation. In the study, {{the issue of whether}} or not to remove the <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> at the implantation site was addressed using simulation on numerical models. Several volume conductor models were built representing, respectively: the cuff implanted directly around the nerve; the cuff over the nerve after connective tissue encapsulated the implant; and the cuff electrode placed around the <b>dura</b> <b>mater.</b> Stimulation-induced electric potential fields were computed for these configurations using a full 3 D finite elements software. Responses of fibres within the nerve were computed. A large range of dural conductivities and several CSF thicknesses were considered. In all simulated conditions, the presence of <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> around a layer of CSF increased excitation thresholds. Selectivity performance also decreased, but was found to be independent of the CSF thickness.

40|$|Visual Impairment Intracranial Pressure (VIIP) {{syndrome}} {{is a major}} concern in current space medicine research. While the exact pathology of VIIP is not yet known, it is hypothesized that the microgravity-induced cephalad fluid shift increases intracranial pressure (ICP) and drives remodeling of the optic nerve sheath. To investigate this possibility, we are culturing optic nerve sheath <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> samples under different pressures and investigating changes in tissue composition. To interpret results from this work, it is essential to first understand the biomechanical response of the optic nerve sheath <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> to loading. Here, we investigated the effects of mechanical loading on the porcine optic nerve sheath. Porcine optic nerves (number: 6) were obtained immediately after death from a local abattoir. The optic nerve sheath (<b>dura</b> <b>mater)</b> was isolated from the optic nerve proper, leaving a hollow cylinder of connective tissue that was used for biomechanical characterization. We developed a custom mechanical testing system that allowed for unconfined lengthening, twisting, and circumferential distension of the <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> during inflation and under fixed axial loading. To determine the effects of variations in ICP, the sample was inflated (0 - 60 millimeters Hg) and circumferential distension was simultaneously recorded. These tests were performed under variable axial loads (0. 6 grams - 5. 6 grams at increments of 1 gram) by attaching different weights to one end of the <b>dura</b> <b>mater.</b> Results and Conclusions: The samples demonstrated nonlinear behavior, similar to other soft connective tissue (Figure 1). Large increases in diameter were observed at lower transmural pressures (approximately 0 to 5 millimeters Hg), whereas only small diameter changes were observed at higher pressures. Particularly interesting was the existence of a cross-over point at a pressure of approximately 11 millimeters Hg. At this pressure, the same diameter is obtained for all axial loads applied to the tissue; i. e., as the axial load is varied, the diameter of the <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> remains constant. This cross-over in the pressure-diameter curves occurred in all optic nerve sheaths that were tested, and may correspond with in vivo ICP levels for pigs. These data suggest that diameter of the <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> of the optic nerve remains nearly constant in vivo despite being stretched axially. This may be a homeostatic mechanism aimed at maintaining target stresses/strains on the cells in the <b>dura</b> <b>mater,</b> and deviations from these stresses may {{play an important role in}} optic nerve sheath remodeling. Future studies will involve subjecting the <b>dura</b> <b>mater</b> to varying pressures and axial tensions for extended periods of time, while monitoring changes in the biomechanical properties.
