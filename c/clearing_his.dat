He received the Order of Danilo from Montenegro in 1917, was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1918, received a Distinguished Service Order in 1919 and mentioned in despatches a further six times. His attitude towards regular officers and temperament, {{as well as his}} tendency to act without <b>clearing</b> <b>his</b> actions with superiors, though, resulted in criticism from senior officers.|$|E

5|$|Ezra Meeker's farm at Swamp Place was not {{a success}} as the land was too poor to grow crops. The family {{continued}} to run the store in Steilacoom. On January 5, 1861, Oliver Meeker drowned while returning from a buying trip to San Francisco, when his ship, the Northerner, sank off the California coast. The Meekers had borrowed to finance the trip, and the losses from this disaster reduced Ezra Meeker to near penury. He secured the squatter's claim of Jerry Stilly on land in the Puyallup Valley, and moved {{his wife and children}} there in 1862. While <b>clearing</b> <b>his</b> own holdings, he earned money by helping to clear the land of others. His father and surviving brother, John Meeker, also had claims in the valley. John Meeker had come to Washington Territory by ship in 1859 and had settled in the Puyallup Valley. Ezra Meeker ran for the Washington Territorial Legislature in 1861, but was defeated. In 1869, Meeker ran for Pierce County Surveyor; he was defeated by James Gallagher, 138 votes to 116.|$|E
5|$|Always in {{the thick}} of the action during this campaign, on 24 February, Nansouty was present near the city of Troyes. Negotiations for an {{armistice}} were ongoing in a village nearby and, despite formal orders to continue the fighting, the two armies had ceased the combat. Nansouty then took his men and attacked enemy troops, charging into the streets of the village where the negotiations were taking place. The French envoy to the armistice talks, Monsieur de Flahaut saw this development and found Nansouty, bitterly protesting against the latter's action. Nansouty responded that the Emperor was doubtlessly aware that negotiations were indeed taking place there, but that he had orders to capture the position without further delay. On 27 February, the Emperor again moved against Blücher's Prussians, leaving a part of his forces near Troyes to observe the movement of Prince of Schwarzenberg's Austrian army. Nansouty, with the Guard cavalry, accompanied the Emperor, ensuring his protection and <b>clearing</b> <b>his</b> way after a bloody cavalry skirmish at Château-Thierry on 3 March. Another cavalry skirmish occurred on 5 March, with Nansouty repulsing a numerous enemy cavalry, 3,000-4,000 troopers, and capturing the bridge of Berry-au-Bac, over the Aisne, despite the enemy cannonade. Once across the Aisne with a few Polish lancer platoons, Nansouty launched a heroic pursuit, capturing enemy cannons and munitions, and taking a significant number of prisoners, among whom was the teenage Russian Prince Gagarin.|$|E

25|$|Hoddle {{was back}} in {{football}} within a year as Southampton manager, succeeding Dave Jones, who had been suspended to concentrate on <b>clearing</b> <b>his</b> name in connection with child abuse charges. Although these charges were later found to be false, Jones was not re-instated and Hoddle continued to be manager. Hoddle kept the Saints in the Premier League against all odds but left acrimoniously in March 2001 to return to Tottenham as manager. Southampton were on course for a 10th-place finish – their highest since 1995 – when Hoddle left.|$|E

25|$|On 18 August 2009, the Supreme Court of Ukraine {{referred}} {{the case}} {{back to the}} Dnepropetrovsk regional court of appeal.

Speaking at a press conference, Igor Sayenko and Vladimir Suprunyuk repeated their belief that the case was based on fabricated evidence. A spokesperson for the prosecutor's office said that the decision to refer the case back to the appeal court was procedural, and that they were confident that the verdict would be upheld. The appeal was scheduled for 5 October 2009. In an interview with the newspaper Novi Most, the mothers of Suprunyuk and Sayenko said that their children were being treated well in prison. It was also reported that Igor Sayenko was considering setting up a website about the case.|$|E
25|$|In October 1788 Hunter {{was ordered}} to sail on HMS Sirius to the Cape of Good Hope for supplies. He {{returned}} to New South Wales in May 1789 after circumnavigating the globe where he resumed former duties as a magistrate and surveyor of the Port Jackson area. In April 1792, following the wreck of HMS Sirius at Norfolk Island in 1790, Hunter returned to England where he was court marshalled {{for the loss of}} the vessel under his command, and honourably acquitted. In 1795 Hunter succeeded Arthur Phillip as the governor of New South Wales and served in this capacity until September 1800. His term as the governor was difficult and, after being accused of lack of competency and leadership, he was recalled from the office. He left for England having handed over the government of the colony to Philip Gidley King. Hunter returned to England in 1801 where he succeeded in <b>clearing</b> <b>his</b> name. He regained his standing in society and continued to progress his naval career. In 1807 he was promoted to rear-admiral, and finally in July 1810 to the rank of vice-Admiral. He died on 13 March 1821 in London.|$|E

In 1658 Edward Cole of London published Wheelwright's A Brief and Plain Apology, whose lengthy subtitle read [...] "Wherein he doth vindicate himself, From al those Errors, Heresies, and Flagitious Crimes, layed to his charge by Mr. Thomas Weld, in his short story, And further Fastened upon him by Mr. Samuel Rutherford in his Survey of Antinomianisme".|$|E

[...] Nicholson attempted to prevent Vetch from sailing for England where he might better defend himself, forcing Vetch to flee beyond Nicholson's reach to New London, Connecticut, in order to get a ship for England.

500|$|In Kiltearn {{there had}} been a settlement, an old ferm toun known as Drummond (Drumainn), near the {{location}} of Evanton, and several lordly residences, such as Foulis, Novar and Balconie Castle. [...] In 1807, the local landowner Alexander Fraser was <b>clearing</b> <b>his</b> estates to make way for sheep, and founded Evanton as a planned settlement for the relocated residents, [...] modestly naming it after his son. To this day, {{in the words of one}} historian, Evanton [...] "remains today an attractive example of a well planned, regularly laid out estate village". The Reverend Thomas Munro expressed similar sentiments in the 1840s, when he wrote that [...] "the village was built on a waste of land, and differs from all others in the country by its regular and neat appearance". The village suffered from the severe famine that plagued the Highlands in the 1840s. There was a riot in the village in 1846, because the authorities continued to export grain despite the failure of the previous year's potato crop; similar riots occurred in Rosemarkie, Balintraid and Avoch. In 1847, there was near starvation in the village, and the villagers managed to maintain themselves on turnips. However, the village population recovered; by the beginnings of the First World War, Evanton had taken much of its current physical shape, and at this point in time contained businesses as diverse as a tobacconist and a bicycle shop, both of which have subsequently disappeared.|$|E
500|$|The next day, SpongeBob {{begins to}} notice that {{everyone}} in town is behaving like jerks. SpongeBob meets Sandy at her treedome, {{and she was a}} jerk, too.

He and Sandy discover the antidote for Jerktonium to cure the residents in Bikini Bottom is a song called [...] "Don't Be a Jerk (It's Christmas!)." [...] SpongeBob sings it, bringing back the residents' Christmas spirit. Unfortunately, it was too late when Santa arrives and states that everyone is on his naughty list, except for Plankton, who is the only nice person there is, which has earned him the Krabby Patty formula, much to Mr. Krabs shock. SpongeBob tries to convince Santa that this is all a mistake, but Santa refuses to believe him, saying he's the worst of all, being blamed for his robot doppelganger's deeds. The wind-up robot shows up to eliminate Santa, but SpongeBob fights the robot with the fruitcake dispenser and finally destroys it, <b>clearing</b> <b>his</b> name. Santa thanks SpongeBob for saving him, which shows that SpongeBob is good, but then he finds the robot's wind-up key by reading [...] "If found, please return to the Chum Bucket," [...] revealing that Plankton was behind all the chaos, and punishes Plankton by giving him, once again, a stocking of coal.
