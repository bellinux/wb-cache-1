He was forced to cease publication of his Cork Free Press in 1916 soon after the appointment of Lord Decies as Chief Press Censor for Ireland. Decies warned the press to be <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> they published. Such warnings had little effect when dealing with such papers as the Cork Free Press. It was suppressed after its republican editor, Frank Gallagher, accused the British authorities of lying about the conditions and situation of republican prisoners in the Frongoch internment camp.|$|E

Asmussen mentioned the possibility of downloadable content; the game would be shipped with the regular challenge mode, and new challenge modes might be released as downloadable content to maintain the series.

In October, an Ultimate Edition was unveiled for North America, and an Ultimate Trilogy Edition was announced soon afterwards for a limited European, Australian, and New Zealand release. A Trilogy Edition was announced for Japan, where the Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO) gave the game an adults-only Z rating after the previous two versions were considered suitable for players 17 and older.|$|E
500|$|Mother Night, {{published}} in 1961, received little {{attention at the}} time of its publication. Howard W. Campbell Jr., Vonnegut's protagonist, is an American who goes to Nazi Germany during the war as a double agent for the U.S. Office of Strategic Services, and rises to the regime's highest ranks as a radio propagandist. After the war, the spy agency refuses to clear his name and he is eventually imprisoned by the Israelis in the same cell block as Adolf Eichmann, and later commits suicide. Vonnegut wrote in a foreword to a later edition, [...] "we are what we pretend to be, so we must be <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> we pretend to be". Literary critic Lawrence Berkove considered the novel, like Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, to illustrate the tendency for [...] "impersonators to get carried away by their impersonations, to become what they impersonate and therefore to live in a world of illusion".|$|E

[...] From April 2011 until April 2012, several sources claimed that a fourth main entry would release sometime in 2012 and would feature an online component. On April 12, 2012, Sony released a teaser image on its official PlayStation Facebook page, which was followed by the game's announcement on April 19, though Amazon leaked the announcement the day before. The trailer announced Todd Papy, who had worked as a designer on God of War and God of War II and as Design Director on God of War III, as Game Director. David Jaffe confirmed that God of War III Game Director Stig Asmussen did not return to direct this game because he was working on another project at Santa Monica. The announcement trailer was narrated by Linda Hunt; it refers to a time before Kratos became the Ghost of Sparta and was not [...] "bound in blood". The announcement officially confirmed that the game's title would be God of War: Ascension. Papy said the game was not titled God of War IV to avoid confusion because it is a prequel, rather than a sequel, to the trilogy. The name was chosen because it complements the story and the additional multiplayer component; according to Papy, in this mode, players are [...] "basically ascending from an unknown hero to a god".|$|E

Reubens was also <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> should be associated with Pee-wee. Being a heavy smoker, he {{went to great lengths}} never to be photographed with a cigarette in his mouth.

40|$|Efforts {{to improve}} {{schooling}} {{under the banner}} of raising standards are taking hold throughout New York State. The emphasis on standards means that all students must meet a range of expectations held by the standards designers. But is there a chance that the rhetoric about standards can improve the education of American Indian children? Given the enormous disparities in the cultural conditions of Aboriginal students, the attainment of standards suggests necessary structural changes in the curriculum, instructional methods and materials, and the standards used to judge performance. This paper looks more closely at the utilization of participatory research in a curriculum development and teaching project that addresses the intercultural or interethnic needs of American Indian students. The paper addresses itself to examining the crisis of the education of Aboriginal children and to developing a new school orientation that sees Aboriginal educational endeavors in a new light. The contexts and arguments suggest that whereas Aboriginal perspective to learning is useful in redefining old problems and proposing fresh alternatives, there are some grounds for <b>careful</b> optimism <b>about</b> <b>what</b> might be possible...|$|R

Eva Le Gallienne in particular was furious, denouncing de Acosta as a liar and stating that she invented the stories for fame. This characterization is inaccurate since many of her affairs and relationships with women, including that with Le Gallienne, are confirmed in personal correspondence. An exception to this was Marlene Dietrich, who continued to correspond with her and loved the book. According to critic Patricia White, [...] "If she craved being seen, MdA was more <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> she said than she is given credit for. She wrote a name-dropping memoir, but for something attacked for exaggeration, it barely alludes to homosexuality". In any case, she gained a reputation that was not appreciated by everyone.

The tour had many sold-out concerts and marked the {{consolidation}} of the band in North America, but was also accompanied by an unexpected announcement: Kuoppala decided to quit Children of Bodom for personal reasons {{right in the middle}} of the tour without giving previous warning. In an interview, when Laiho was asked why Kuoppala left the band, he stated that, [...] "Well, I try to be <b>careful</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> I say about him because there is no bad blood between us. He told me that he just got sick of touring and the whole band/rock 'n roll lifestyle living in hotels and tour buses and stuff. For me it was really weird because he was always the one who was SO into it! He was a die hard rock 'n roller and suddenly he made a quick 180 turn in his whole life. This whole situation involves a new girlfriend." [...] Griffin's guitarist Kai Nergaard was invited by Laiho to replace Kuoppala, but did not accept the offer. Thus, Alexi's bandmate from Sinergy, Roope Latvala (founding member of Stone, one of the bands which started the heavy metal movement in Finland) assumed the guitars as a session player, until a more permanent solution could be found. This formation was introduced in Moscow on 16 August.|$|E
40|$|The federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) {{makes it}} a crime to “access a {{computer}} without authorization or exceed authorized access. ” Courts and commentators have struggled to explain what types of conduct by a computer user are “without authorization. ” But this approach is backwards; authorization {{is not so much a}} question of what a computer user does, as it is a question of what a computer owner allows. In other words, authorization under the CFAA is an issue of consent, not conduct; to understand authorization, we need to understand consent. Building on Peter Westen’s taxonomy of consent, I argue that we should distinguish between the factual question of what uses a computer owner manifests her consent to and the legal question of what uses courts will deem her to have consented to. Doing so allows to distinguish the different kinds of questions presented by different kinds of CFAA cases, and to give clearer and more precise answers to all of them. Some cases require <b>careful</b> fact-finding <b>about</b> <b>what</b> reasonable computer users in the defendant’s position would have known about the owner’s expressed intentions; other cases require frank policy judgments about which kinds of unwanted uses should be considered serious enough to trigger the CFAA...|$|R
40|$|Soumission en cours à ACM TOPLASLate binding and subtyping create {{run-time}} overhead for object-oriented languages, {{especially in}} the context of both multiple inheritance and dynamic loading, for instance for interfaces. In a previous paper, we have proposed a novel approach based on perfect hashing and truly constant-time hashtables for implementing subtype testing and method invocation in a dynamic loading setting. In this first study, we based our efficiency assessment on Driesen's abstract computational model for the time standpoint, and on large-scale benchmarks for the space standpoint. The conclusions were that the technique was promising but required further research in order to assess its scalability. This article presents some new results about this approach that reinforces its interest. We propose and test both new hashing functions and an inverted problem which amounts to selecting the best class identifiers in order to minimize the overall hashtable size. Experiments within an extended testbed with random class loading and under <b>careful</b> assumptions <b>about</b> <b>what</b> should be a sensible class loading order show that perfect hashing scales up gracefully. Furthermore, we tested perfect hashing for subtype testing and method invocation in the compiler and we compare it with the coloring technique that amounts to maintain in multiple inheritance the single inheritance implementation. The result exceeds our expectations...|$|R
