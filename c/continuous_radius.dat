5000|$|The {{first product}} {{to come out}} of KMI Labs is the BopPad, an {{expressive}} MIDI drum pad controller for percussionists, and producers that is the world's most responsive smart drum pad. The Kickstarter campaign for the BopPad reached its funding goal in three days. It advances accurate hit detection via velocity, <b>continuous</b> <b>radius,</b> and pressure sensitivity with an extremely quick playing surface. BopPad's advanced architecture allows for an annovative instrument that [...] "sees" [...] every gesture, hit or tap and responds to the nuances of any percussive performance, perfectly measuring strike velocity from the softest hand-drumming actions to the strongest percussive assault. The BopPad software, which will be available as a desktop download and iOS app—allows four independently programmable zones (or quadrants) to be assigned to play up to six simultaneous notes with six expressive timbre maps. At the heart of the BopPad is the world's largest smart fabric sensor. The smart fabric is the same as that used in products from Keith McMillen Instruments and McMillen's BeBop Sensors.|$|E
50|$|Quantization errors {{arise in}} {{standard}} skeletonization algorithms from the integer nature of digital images. The requirement for accurate representation of fine dendritic geometry has required {{the development of}} novel adaptations of standard skeletonization and diameter estimation algorithms to correct for these quantization errors. Iterative thinning skeletonization methods can provide a distance in voxels from each tree node {{to the surface of}} the object. This distance is the D6 metric, obtained by counting the number of voxels as they are removed in the minimal 6-connected path from the surface to the medial axis. In existing skeletonization or vectorization algorithms for dendritic morphometry, the branch cross-section at any node is approximated as circular, with the D6 metric providing the single diameter estimate. The precision of this diameter estimate is limited to the physical size of the voxels. For small structures such as thin dendrites and spines, comprising only a few voxels even at maximal imaging resolution, the error can be significant if this measure is used directly (see figure). To minimize quantization error and evaluate more precisely the geometry of the nodes, a new estimation technique exists, the Rayburst Sampling Algorithm that uses the original grayscale data rather than the segmented images for precise, <b>continuous</b> <b>radius</b> estimation, and multidirectional radius sampling to more accurately represent non-circular branch cross-sections and non-spherical spine heads.|$|E

50|$|The Rayburst Sampling Algorithm {{uses the}} {{original}} grayscale data {{rather than the}} segmented images for precise, <b>continuous</b> <b>radius</b> estimation, and multidirectional radius sampling to more accurately represent non-circular branch cross-sections and non-spherical spine heads. The algorithm precomputes an array of unit vectors which sample the data in multiple directions, (the Sampling Core) from which {{an estimate of the}} node's geometry is computed. Accurate representation of each direction by the sampling core requires that the N vectors should be uniformly spaced over the unit sphere. The algorithm uses a particle physics simulation in which a set N of randomly oriented unit vectors is generated, resulting in a random, nonuniform distribution of points on the sphere. Each particle then receives a repulsive force from every other particle, proportional to the inverse square of the distance between them. By iteratively displacing the particle {{in the direction of the}} resultant forces, the particles rearrange themselves. This system will tend to a stable, minimum energy configuration within approximately 40 iterations, where each particle is maximally separated from its closest neighbors. The information can be used to reconstruct 3D branches of arbitrarily irregular shapes. The diameter of an equivalent circular cross-section is computed in the plane normal to the medial axis using the Median Lower Band Diameter (MLBD). To compute the MLBD, take the set of samples and add the corresponding pairs of opposite vectors. Sort the vectors by size, define the lower band as the lower 50%, and use the distance at position N/4, representing the median of the lower band, to estimate the diameter.|$|E

40|$|The {{empirical}} {{relation between}} the transient crater diameter (Dg) and final crater diameter (Dr) of complex craters and basins is estimated using cumulative terrace widths, central uplift diameters, <b>continuous</b> ejecta <b>radii,</b> and transient crater reconstructions determined from lunar and terrestrial impact structures. The ratio Dg/Dr is a power law function of Dr, decreasing uniformly from unity at {{the diameter of the}} simple-complex crater morphology transition to about 0. 5 for large multiring basins like Imbrium on the moon. The empirical constants in the Dg/Dr relation are interpreted physically to mean that the position of the final rim relative to the transient crater, and hence the extent of collapse, is controlled or greatly influenced by the properties of the zone of dissociated material produced by the impact shock. The continuity of the Dg/Dr relation over the entire spectrum of morphologic types from complex craters to multiring basins implies that the rims of all these structures form in the same tectonic environment despite morphologic differences...|$|R

40|$|We present {{ultraviolet}} {{integrated and}} azimuthally-averaged surface photometric properties {{of a sample}} of 44 dIm, BCD, and Sm galaxies measured from archival NUV and FUV images obtained with GALEX. We compare the UV to Halpha and V-band properties and convert FUV, Halpha, and V-band luminosities into star formation rates (SFRs). We also model the star formation history from colors and compare the integrated SFRs and SFR profiles with radius for these methods. In most galaxies, the UV photometry extends beyond Halpha in radius, providing a better measure of the star formation activity in the outer disks. The Halpha appears to be lacking in the outer disk because of faintness in low density gas. The FUV and V-band profiles are <b>continuous</b> with <b>radius,</b> although they sometimes have a kink from a double exponential disk. There is no obvious difference in star formation properties between {{the inner and outer}} disks.

5000|$|When a river {{reaches a}} low-lying plain, often {{in its final}} course to the sea or a lake, it meanders widely.

In contrast, both lateral erosion and undercutting occur on the cut bank or concave bank (the bank with the greater <b>radius.)</b> <b>Continuous</b> deposition on the convex bank and erosion of the concave bank of a meandering river cause {{the formation of a}} very pronounced meander with two [...] banks getting closer. The narrow neck of land between the two neighboring concave banks is finally cut through, either by lateral erosion of the two concave banks or by the strong currents of a flood. When this happens, a new straighter river channel is created and an abandoned meander loop, called a cutoff, is formed. When deposition finally seals off the cutoff from the river channel, an oxbow lake is formed.

40|$|Secondary ion mass {{spectrometry}} (SIMS) U-Pb ages of Ca-phosphates from four texturally distinct breccia samples (72255, 76055, 76015, 76215) {{collected at the}} Apollo 17 landing site were obtained {{in an attempt to}} identify whether they represent a single or several impact event(s). The determined ages, combined with inferences from petrologic relationships, may indicate two or possibly three different impact events at 3920 ± 3 Ma, 3922 ± 5 Ma and 3930 ± 5 Ma (all errors 2 σ). Searching for possible sources of the breccias by calculating the <b>continuous</b> ejecta <b>radii</b> of impact basins and large craters as well as their expected ejecta thicknesses, we conclude that Nectaris, Crisium, Serenitatis and Imbrium are likely candidates. If the previous interpretation that the micropoikilitic breccias collected at the North Massif represent Serenitatis ejecta is correct, then the average 207 Pb/ 206 Pb age of 3930 ± 5 Ma (2 σ) dates the formation of the Serenitatis basin. The occurrence of zircon in the breccias sampled at the South Massif, which contain Ca-phosphates yielding an age of 3922 ± 5 Ma (2 σ), may indicate that the breccia originated from within the Procellarum KREEP terrane (PKT) and the Imbrium basin appears to be the only basin that could have sourced them. However, this interpretation implies that all basins suggested to fall stratigraphically between Serenitatis and Imbrium formed within a short (< 11 Ma) time interval, highlighting serious contradictions between global stratigraphic constraints, sample interpretation and chronological data. Alternatively, the slightly older age of the two micropoikilitic breccias may be a result of incomplete resetting of the U-Pb system preserved in some phosphate grains. Based on the currently available dataset this possibility cannot be excluded. GEO KAW Early Planetary Evolutio...|$|R

The mechanical behavior of the inhomogeneous body in an infinite domain is very complicated. In this paper, a detailed expression about the fictitious stress method of the boundary element method (BEM) is demonstrated for the inhomogeneous body. Then the fictitious stress method is deployed to investigate the stresses for the multi-casing structure under non-uniform loading conditions and an irregular wellbore. Three examples of the multi-casing {{structure in}} the borehole imply the high effectiveness of BEM for complex geometries related to the borehole in an infinite formation.

40|$|The distal biceps brachii tendon is {{commonly}} susceptible to traumatic injury. This study aimed {{to describe the}} morphology of the distal biceps brachii tendon {{in relation to the}} commonly used endobutton repair of tendon rupture. The results suggested that the distal tendon is a series of distinct bands of variable number. These bands are obscured surgically by the tendon sheath. Upon opening this sheath, blunt dissection of the tendon released fibrous connections between the tendon bands. Adjacent bands were variably connected via small oblique bands. The separations between bands were <b>continuous</b> onto the <b>radius.</b> They were therefore considered as separate force-conducting units. This notion is of high relevance to endobutton repairs, as the sutures are typically only passed through the margins of the tendon. Where few connections exist between tendinous bands, this represents a potential weakness, as central bands are therefore free to be pulled proximally. This is of primary concern in the early rehabilitative stages of postoperative care. It may be suggested that sutures that cross the width of the tendon will eliminate the give of central bands, improving postoperative results, reducing revision numbers, and potentially reducing rehabilitation time...|$|R

Starting at a circular equatorial orbit of radius about 1. 3 / 1. 4 times the Jovian <b>radius,</b> <b>continuous</b> propellantless Lorentz drag on a thin-tape tether in the 1 - 5 km length range would make a spacecraft many times as heavy as the tape slowly spiral in, {{over a period of}} many months, while generating power at a load plugged in the tether circuit for powering instruments in science data acquisition and transmission. Lying under the Jovian radiation belts, the tape would avoid the most severe problem facing tethers in Jupiter, which are capable of producing both power and propulsion but, operating slowly, could otherwise accumulate too high a radiation dose. The tether would be made to spin in its orbit to keep taut; how to balance the Lorentz torque is discussed. Constraints on heating and bowing are also discussed, comparing conditions for prograde versus retrograde orbits.

40|$|We present gas {{and total}} mass {{profiles}} for 13 low-redshift, relaxed clusters spanning a temperature range 0. 7 – 9 keV, derived from all available Chandra data of sufficient quality. In all clusters, gas temperature profiles are measured to large radii (Vikhlinin et al.) so that direct hydrostatic mass estimates are possible to nearly r 500 or beyond. The gas density was accurately traced to larger radii; its profile is not described well by a beta-model, showing <b>continuous</b> steepening with <b>radius.</b> The derivedρtot profiles and their scaling with mass generally follow the Navarro-Frenk-White model with concentration expected for dark matter halos inΛCDM cosmology. However, in three cool clusters, we detect a central mass component {{in excess of}} the NFW profile, apparently associated with their cD galaxies. In the inner region (r< 0. 1 r 500), the gas density and temperature profiles exhibit significant scatter and trends with mass, but they become nearly self-similar at larger radii. Correspondingly, we find that the slope of the mass-temperature relation for these relaxed clusters is in good agreement with the simple self-similar behavior, M 500 ∝ T α where α=(1. 5 − 1. 6) ± 0. 1, if the gas temperatures are measured excluding the central cool cores. The normalization of this M − T relation is significantly, by ≈ 30 %, higher than most previous X-ray determinations. We derive accurate gas mass fraction profiles, which show increase both with radius and cluster mass.

In all the complexes the piperazine nitrogen of the ligand takes part in coordination and leads to the complexes of group 12 metal ions having structural diversity. The X-ray diffraction analysis of complex 1 indicates for one Zn(II) ion a geometry in between trigonal bipyramidal/square pyramidal and for the second a distorted tetrahedral sphere. In the polymeric complex 2 the Cd(II) ion shows a distorted octahedral environment, while in the mononuclear complex 3, where Hg(II) exhibits a square-pyramidal geometry, an unexpected condensation between the uncoordinated NH piperazine fragment with 2 -pyridinecarboxaldehyde was detected.

The photoluminescence properties of the complexes {{as well as of the}} ligand were investigated in solution at ambient temperature. The low quantum yield of the ligand was ascribed due to a very fast photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the nitrogen lone pair to the conjugated pyridine moiety. Complexation prevents the electron transfer, and consequently an increase in quantum yield was observed in the complexes. Among the three complexes the highest photoluminescence was exhibited by a Zn complex, being lower in Cd and Hg complexes as a consequence of the heavy atom perturbation effect...|$|R
40|$|The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty {{requires}} {{the ability to}} detect low-yield (less than 150 kton) nuclear events. This kind of monitoring can only be done seismically on a regional scale (within 2000 km). At this level, {{it is difficult to}} distinguish between low-yield nuclear events and non-nuclear events of similar magnitude. In order to confidently identify a nuclear event, a more detailed understanding of nuclear seismic sources is needed. In particular, {{it is important to know}} the effects of local geology on the seismic signal. This study focuses on P-wave velocity in heterogeneous granitoid. The Source Physics Experiment (SPE) is currently performing low-yield tests with chemical explosives at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS). The exact test site was chosen to be in the Climax Stock, a cretaceous granodiorite and quartz-monzonite pluton located in Area 15 of the NNSS. It has been used in the past for the Hard Hat and Pile Driver nuclear tests, which provided legacy data that can be used to simulate wave propagation. The Climax Stock was originally chosen as the site of the SPE partly because of its assumed homogeneity. It has since been discovered that the area of the stock where the SPE tests are being performed contains a perched water table. In addition, the stock is known to contain an extensive network of faults, joints, and fractures, but the exact effect of these structural features on seismic wave velocity is not fully understood. The SPE tests are designed to seismically capture the explosion phenomena from the near- to the far-field transition of the seismic waveform. In the first SPE experiment, 100 kg of chemical explosives were set off at a depth of 55 m. The blast was recorded with an array of sensors and diagnostics, including accelerometers, geophones, rotational sensors, short-period and broadband seismic sensors, <b>Continuous</b> Reflectometry for <b>Radius</b> vs. Time Experiment, Time of Arrival, Velocity of Detonation, and infrasound sensors. The focus of this study is two-fold: (1) the geophone array that was focused over the SPE shot and (2) a high-resolution seismic profile that was recently acquired at the field site. The geophone array was placed radially around the SPE shot in five directions with 100 m spacing and out to a distance of 2 km. The high-resolution profile was about 475 m in length with station and shot spacing of 5 m using a 7000 lb mini-vibe as a source. In both data sets, the first arrivals will be used to develop velocity models. For the geophone array, 1 -D P-wave velocity models will be developed to determine an average apparent velocity of the Climax Stock. The high-resolution data will be used to develop a 2 -D P-wave velocity model along the seismic profile. This is in an effort to elucidate the water table in more detail and provide additional information on the near-surface structure. These results will be used in the overall modeling effort to fully characterize the test bed and develop a physics-based model to simulate seismic energy from the SPE events...|$|R
