40|$|AbstractWe {{identify}} {{a class of}} problems, called <b>controlled</b> <b>selection</b> problems, and study their complexity. A <b>controlled</b> <b>selection</b> problem involves a random selection of a sample from a large set subject to certain structural constraints. The structural constraints model some desired relationships among {{the elements of the}} set, which we want to preserve under random selection. For example, the set may be divided into equivalence classes and we may want to ensure that not too many elements are chosen from the same class, or the set may correspond to vertices of a graph and we may want to ensure that the sample does not induce a cycle. <b>Controlled</b> <b>selection</b> problems arise in many disciplines, including statistics, mathematical programming, combinatorial algorithms, and resource allocation. This is the first attempt to unify them. We develop techniques for determining the complexity of <b>controlled</b> <b>selection</b> problems given the structural constraints. We use these techniques to determine the complexity of many types of <b>controlled</b> <b>selection</b> problems. We show that a <b>controlled</b> <b>selection</b> problem is polynomial-time reducible to the problem of finding a maximum weight sample satisfying the structural constraints. We also show that a general reduction in the opposite direction would imply that one-way functions do not exist. In contrast, we show that most natural <b>controlled</b> <b>selection</b> problems have the same complexity (within polynomial time) as the problem of finding a maximum weight sample satisfying the structural constraints. We also present efficient algorithms for several <b>controlled</b> <b>selection</b> problems...|$|R

Since then the procedure has been implemented but {{with a number of}} modifications not discussed in Izsak et al. (2005). These modifications and possible future changes are discussed in this new paper. They include: weighting changes necessitated by the use of <b>controlled</b> <b>selection,</b> complications caused by rounding issues and how they were overcome, complexities caused by the need to allocate over five sampling panels, and use of a real-valued minimum allocation for each sampling cell in the <b>controlled</b> <b>selection</b> process in order to avoid very large sample weights and accompanying increases in variances...|$|R
40|$|Data for the 1961 {{universe}} of nonfederal, short-term general medical {{hospitals in the}} United States are used to illustrate application of estimation and variance formulas for <b>controlled</b> <b>selection,</b> the probability sampling technique developed by Goodman and Kish. Some advantages of this sampling technique are discussed, and a <b>controlled</b> <b>selection</b> model is described. Comparisons are made between the variances of multiple stratification and those of controlled selection; the variances of the latter are seen to have two components, a between pattern and a within pattern component, where a pattern may {{be regarded as a}} first stage sample specifying the number of units to be drawn from each control cell. Three strategies for approximating the sampling variance are investigated. Each is seen to overestimate the per hospital estimate of bed capacity, admissions, and inpatient days, but to underestimate slightly the variance of average length of stay.

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to explore the {{emergence}} of verbal behavior resulting from the joint control of two antecedent stimuli that are presented together for the first time. Conditional discriminations were used for teaching and for probing. Four stimuli P 1, P 2, 01, and 02 were samples and four stimuli A 1, A 2, 81, and 82 were the comparisons in all discriminations of the study. We taught 4 conditional discriminations with 1 sample and 2 comparisons in each trial; overall, each sample <b>controlled</b> <b>selections</b> of 2 comparison stimuli (i. e., sample P 1 <b>controlled</b> <b>selections</b> of A 1 in 1 conditional discrimination and <b>controlled</b> <b>selections</b> of 81 in another conditional discrimination). In a probe with no reinforcement, 1 P and 1 0 stimuli formed a compound sample, and the 4 comparisons appeared in each trial. Only selections of 1 comparison have been reinforced in the presence of the 2 sample stimuli during teaching (i. e., only selections of A 1 have been reinforced in the presence of P 1, in 1 conditional discrimination, and in the presence of 01, in the other conditional discrimination). We analyzed whether the 2 sample stimuli would jointly <b>control</b> comparison <b>selections.</b> In Study 1, 2 adult participants did not show the emergence of the discrimination with the compound samples. In Study 2, we modified the procedure of Study 1 in such a way that (a) a prompt procedure was used, (b) trials of the 4 single-sample conditional discriminations were gradually intermixed, and (c) the reinforcement was reduced. The 2 adult participants showed the emergence of the conditional discrimination with the compound samples. This study thus demonstrated the emergence of discriminations by joint control.

40|$|A {{synthesis}} of classical and recent {{thinking on the}} issues involved in selecting controls for case-control studies is presented in this and two companion papers (S. Wachokter et al. Am J Epidemiol 1992; 135 : 1029 - 50). In this paper, a theoretical framework for selecting controls in case-control studies is developed. Three principles of comparability are described: 1) study base, that all comparisons be made within the study base; 2) deconfounding, that comparisons {{of the effects of}} the levels of exposure on disease risk not be distorted by the effects of other factors; and 3) comparable accuracy, that any errors in measurement of exposure be nondifferential between cases and controls. These principles, if adhered to in a study, can reduce selection, confound-ing, and information bias, respectively. The principles, however, are constrained by an additional efficiency principle regarding resources and time. Most problems and contro-versies in <b>control</b> <b>selection</b> reflect trade-offs among these four principles.

40|$|Determination of the {{relevance}} of both demanding classical epidemiologic criteria for <b>control</b> <b>selection</b> and robust handling of population stratification (PS) represents a major challenge {{in the design and}} analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Empirical data from two GWAS in European Americans of the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) project were used to evaluate the impact of PS in studies with different <b>control</b> <b>selection</b> strategies. In each of the two original case-control studies nested in corresponding prospective cohorts, a minor confounding effect due to PS (inflation factor l of 1. 025 and 1. 005) was observed. In contrast, when the control groups were exchanged to mimic a cost-effective but theoretically less desirable <b>control</b> <b>selection</b> strategy, the confounding effects were larger (l of 1. 090 and 1. 062). A panel of 12, 898 autosomal SNPs common to both the Illumina and Affymetrix commercial platforms and with low local background linkage disequilibrium (pair-wise r 2, 0. 004) was selected to infer population substructure with principal component analysis. A novel permutation procedure was developed for the correction of PS that identified a smaller set of principal components and achieved a better control of type I error (to l of 1. 032 and 1. 006, respectively) than currently used methods. The overlap between sets of SNPs in the bottom 5 % of p-values based on the new test and the test without PS correction was about 80 %, with the majority of discordant SNPs having both ranks close to the threshold. Thus, for the CGEMS GWAS of prostate and breast cancer conducted in European Americans, PS {{does not appear to be}} a major proble...|$|E
