40|$|This chapter {{provides}} a tutorial {{introduction to the}} logic of <b>closed-loop</b> <b>systems.</b> A series of examples is presented to illustrate the dynamics of <b>closed-loop</b> <b>systems</b> and to contrast the behavior of these systems with expectations suggested by the logic of open-loop causal systems. In particular, the examples show that “feedback” per se is insufficient to guarantee convergence on a target. The chapter explores {{some of the issues}} that must be addressed in order to determine whether <b>closed-loop</b> <b>systems</b> will be stable.

40|$|Purpose – To {{delineate}} typologies {{that capture}} {{the relationship between}} closed-loop supply chains and value-added business models, and thereby to suggest a research agenda for the transition to sustainable business. Design/methodology/approach – Develops four new theoretical categories or typologies of <b>closed-loop</b> <b>systems</b> and applies them to {{the context of the}} automotive industry. Conceptual, rather than empirical. Findings – That hybrid <b>closed-loop</b> <b>systems</b> can be combined with innovative non-linear value configurations to enable the transition to more sustainable production and consumption. Research limitations/implications – Identifies research agenda to explore how novel business models can integrate with various <b>closed-loop</b> <b>systems.</b> Theoretical, but grounded in research into the automotive industry. Practical implications – That <b>closed-loop</b> <b>systems</b> are best implemented outside traditional linear value added structures. Originality/value – Places <b>closed-loop</b> <b>systems</b> {{at the heart of the}} (redesigned) business model rather than as an accessory that must be adapted to the demands of existing approaches.

25|$|Designing and tuning a PID {{controller}} {{appears to}} be conceptually intuitive, but can be hard in practice, if multiple (and often conflicting) objectives such as short transient and high stability are to be achieved. PID controllers often provide acceptable control using default tunings, but performance can generally be improved by careful tuning, and performance may be unacceptable with poor tuning. Usually, initial designs need to be adjusted repeatedly through computer simulations until the <b>closed-loop</b> <b>system</b> performs or compromises as desired.|$|E

25|$|A {{particular}} robustness {{issue is}} the requirement for a control system to perform properly {{in the presence of}} input and state constraints. In the physical world every signal is limited. It could happen that a controller will send control signals that cannot be followed by the physical system, for example, trying to rotate a valve at excessive speed. This can produce undesired behavior of the <b>closed-loop</b> <b>system,</b> or even damage or break actuators or other subsystems. Specific control techniques are available to solve the problem: model predictive control (see later), and anti-wind up systems. The latter consists of an additional control block that ensures that the control signal never exceeds a given threshold.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND:: Automated {{systems can}} improve the {{stability}} of controlled variables and reduce the workload in clinical practice without increasing the risks to patients. We conducted this review and meta-analysis to assess the clinical performance of <b>closed-loop</b> <b>systems</b> compared with manual control. Our primary outcome was the accuracy of <b>closed-loop</b> <b>systems</b> in comparison with manual control to maintain a given variable in a desired target range. The occurrence of overshoot and undershoot episodes was the secondary outcome. METHODS:: We retrieved randomized controlled trials on accuracy and safety of <b>closed-loop</b> <b>systems</b> versus manual control. Our primary outcome was the percentage of time during which the system was able to maintain a given variable (e. g., bispectral index or oxygen saturation) in a desired range or {{the proportion of the}} target measurements that was within the required range. Our secondary outcome was the percentage of time or the number of episodes that the controlled variable was above or below the target range. The standardized mean difference and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated for continuous outcomes, whereas the odds ratio and 95 % CI were estimated for dichotomous outcomes. RESULTS:: Thirty-six trials were included. Compared with manual control, automated systems allowed better maintenance of the controlled variable in the anesthesia drug delivery setting (95 % CI, 11. 7 %– 23. 1 %; percentage of time, P 75 %). We observed a significant reduction of episodes of overshooting and undershooting when <b>closed-loop</b> <b>systems</b> were used. CONCLUSIONS:: The use of automated systems can result in better control of a given target within a selected range. There was a decrease of overshooting or undershooting of a given target with <b>closed-loop</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
