40|$|The {{prevalence}} of thermophilic Campylobacter spp. {{was investigated in}} cattle on Washington State farms. A total of 350 thermophilic Campylobacter isolates were isolated from 686 cattle sampled on 15 farms (eight dairies, two <b>calf</b> <b>rearer</b> farms, two feedlots, and three beef cow-calf ranches). Isolate species were identified {{with a combination of}} phenotypic tests, hipO colony blot hybridization, and multiplex lpxA PCR. Breakpoint resistance to four antimicrobials (ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, erythromycin, and doxycycline) was determined by agar dilution. Campylobacter jejuni was the most frequent species isolated (34. 1 %), followed by Campylobacter coli (7. 7 %) and other thermophilic campylobacters (1. 5 %). The most frequently detected resistance was to doxycycline (42. 3 % of 350 isolates). Isolates from <b>calf</b> <b>rearer</b> facilities were more frequently doxycycline resistant than isolates from other farm types. C. jejuni was most frequently susceptible to all four of the antimicrobial drugs studied (58. 8 % of 272 isolates). C. coli isolates were more frequently resistant than C. jejuni, including resistance to quinolone antimicrobials (89. 3 % of isolates obtained from calves on <b>calf</b> <b>rearer</b> farms) and to erythromycin (72. 2 % of isolates obtained from feedlot cattle). Multiple drug resistance was more frequent in C. coli (51. 5 %) than in C. jejuni (5. 1 %).

40|$|A fatal {{pneumonia}} due to Legionella pneumophila {{was diagnosed}} {{in a young}} <b>calf</b> <b>reared</b> in a dairy herd located in northern Italy. Clinical symptoms consisted of watery diarrhea, hyperthermia, anorexia, and severe dyspnea. The pathological and histological findings were {{very similar to those}} observed in human legionellosis. Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (SG 1) and SG 10 were isolated from the calf’s lung, and L. pneumophila SG 1 was isolated from the calf’s liver. L. pneumophila SG 1 was also demonstrated in the lung tissue by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical examinations. Nine of 10 L. pneumophila SG 1 isolates belonged to the Olda subtype, and 1 belonged to the Camperdown subtype. A very low prevalence of antibodies to Legionella was detected in cows and calves reared in the same herd. Cultures of aqueous sediment of an old electric water heater which supplied hot water for the feeding of the calves yielded L. pneumophila SG 1. Four of the colonies tested belonged to the Olda subtype. Ten clinical and four environmental isolates were examined for the presence of plasmids. Nine of them were also examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis assay, and the same patterns were found for L. pneumophila SG 1 Olda strains isolated from the calf and from the electric heater.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} an AI heifer <b>calf</b> <b>rearing</b> scheme on dairy stock development, in a coconut grazing and a peri-urban smallholder dairy production system in the Western Province of Sri Lanka.

40|$|The {{concept of}} animal welfare has been {{approached}} in variable ways throughout {{the scientific and}} philosophical world and no consensus seems to exist about what a {{quality of life is}} for animals in agricultural systems. Aim of the study is to compile and compare the different animal welfare approaches found across the literature and examine implications of the organic approach to welfare for the rearing of organic dairy calves. Three main approaches to animal welfare have been identified in the literature. According to the biological functioning approach, welfare is accomplished when the animals are healthy and productive. In the subjective feelings approach welfare is accomplished when the animals are feeling good. In the natural living approach a natural life is considered as a life of welfare, during which the animal is fulfilling its life by experiencing its inherent nature. The different approaches result from different underlying values and concerns about how animals ought to be treated reflecting how science based arguments are connected to ethical guidelines. In organic farming the concept of naturalness is of major importance. In the organic philosophy, animal welfare is interpreted in terms of natural living (natural behaviour, environment and feed), but in the organic regulations the naturalness related requirements in dairy <b>calf</b> <b>rearing</b> are limited. Furthermore, a case study was conducted in 12 dairy farms in Norway and Sweden, in order to examine how the concept of naturalness can be best implemented in organic dairy <b>calf</b> <b>rearing.</b> The results show that implementation of naturalness in dairy <b>calf</b> <b>rearing</b> depends on regulation, on the farmer’s perception of welfare and on economic restrictions. Elements of naturalness that could be further implemented in organic dairy <b>calf</b> <b>rearing,</b> include natural suckling, feeding milk ad libitum, space allowance, outdoor access and socializing possibilities. To {{determine the extent to which}} these elements of naturalness should be implemented in an organic dairy system, it is suggested that a definition of animal welfare and of naturalness is needed, in order to overcome the dilemmas existing between organic theory and practice...|$|E
5000|$|Birthing in cattle {{is typical}} of a larger mammal. A cow goes through three stages of labor during normal {{delivery}} of a calf. During stage one, the animal seeks a quiet place away {{from the rest of}} the herd. Hormone changes cause soft tissues of the birth canal to relax as the mother's body prepares for birth. The contractions of the uterus are not obvious externally, but the cow may be restless. She may appear agitated, alternating between standing and lying down, with her tail slightly raised and her back arched. The fetus is pushed toward the birth canal by each contraction and the cow's cervix gradually begins to dilate. Stage one may last several hours, and ends when the cervix is fully dilated. Stage two can be seen to be underway when there is external protrusion of the amniotic sac through the vulva, closely followed by the appearance of the calf's front hooves and head in a front presentation (or occasionally the <b>calf's</b> tail and <b>rear</b> end in a posterior presentation). [...] During the second stage, the cow will usually lie down on her side to push and the calf progresses through the birth canal. The complete delivery of the calf (or calves in a multiple birth) signifies the end of stage two. The cow scrambles to her feet (if lying down at this stage), turns round and starts vigorously licking the calf. The calf takes its first few breaths and within minutes is struggling to rise to its feet. The third and final stage of labor is the delivery of the placenta, which is usually expelled within a few hours and is often eaten by the normally herbivorous cow.|$|R
40|$|In August 2006, Bluetongue disease, a {{viral disease}} of {{domestic}} and wild ruminants (originating from Africa), first occurred in the border triangle of the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany and thus threatened the local livestock. The objective of the present thesis {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of untreated nets and nets treated with an insecticide in order to prevent biting midges (Ceratopogonidae, Culidcoides spp.) known as the vector of the Bluetongue virus and other pest insects (Muscidae spp.) from entering open cattle pens. In summer/fall 2009, field research was undertaken on a dairy cattle farm in Lögow in the district of Ostprignitz-Ruppin in the federal state of Brandenburg. During a first trial (from June until August 2009), the most effective net was identified in an experimental set up that was easy to observe, and calf houses were chosen for this. Two testing groups out of three testing units each were established to observe the effectiveness of both nets one untreated and one treated with an insecticide respectively. One testing unit consisted of five calf houses each furnished with one <b>calf</b> that was <b>reared</b> in the enclosure for a period of three weeks being separated from its mother immediately after being born. The testing units were protected with the net, either completely (side walls and roof) or partly (fence at 1. 8 meters height). One testing unit was not protected to serve as a control group. The level of effectiveness was observed by collecting target insects. One ultraviolet light trap (Biogents Sentinel® UV light trap) was installed in the centre of each testing unit. The traps were activated during three intervals between Sunday and Monday from 5 p. m. until 9 a. m. the following day. Towards the end of this first trial, insecticide-free glue traps (Glue-Fly Ribbon Traps® Eurofarm, Bützberg, Switzerland) were set up in each of the testing units. The impact of these protective measures towards productivity (development of weight) as well as the general well-being of the calves (defense mechanisms and fly infestation intensity) was also taken into account during the observations. The insecticide-treated net was made of polyester with a mesh size of 1. 6 x 1. 7 mm and contained encapsulated deltamethrin at an initial concentration of 115 mg/m². The two types of untreated nets used in this study were one black fabric made of polyethylene with an irregular mesh size of 0. 7 to 1. 2 mm and one olive-colored texture with a regular mesh size of less than 1 mm. The untreated nets did not lead to a sustainable reduction of biting midges and other pest insects in the protected testing units. However, the second type of untreated net (mesh size less than 1 mm) resulted in a significant decline in defense mechanisms of the calves in the testing unit that was protected by the netting fence at 1. 80 m height. In the testing unit that was partly protected with the insecticide-treated net, a significant reduction at an average of 73. 6 % (p= 0. 001) of biting midges was observed compared to the control group. Against all expectations, most of the biting midges (47. 7 % {{of the total number of}} insects collected from all testing units) were found in the testing unit that was completelysurrounded by nets. Yet, in the same testing unit a considerable effect on pest insects in general was observed. The ratio of flies was only 6. 5 % of the total number of collected flies. Furthermore, a significantly smaller (p< 0. 0001) infestation of the calves with flies was recorded. It was not verified that the protection with neither treated nor untreated nets had an impact on the calves’ development of weights. During a second trial (from August until October 2009) the insecticide-treated net was set up for the protection of dairy cattle in a stable (intervention group). The entire building excluding two access roads was equipped with a free-standing netting fence at 2. 20 m height. Another stable that was identical in construction and aligned parallel to the intervention stable remained without netting and served as control group. In both pens, three UV light traps were installed in the same position to collect biting midges, and two insecticide-free glue traps were set up to catch pest insects (Muscidae spp.) During the entire observation period, a sustainable effect on the number of biting midges and flies could be examined. The significant reduction of biting midges in the intervention group compared to the control group was at 41. 9 % (p= 0. 0391), the reduction of flies on average 77. 2 % (p= 0. 0039). From June until October 2009, four UV light traps were set up in the close vicinity of the testing units and cattle stables in and outside of the farm premises to monitor the abundance of biting midges at the location Lögow. For the duration of entomologic monitoring from the beginning of June until the end of October 2009, the number of insects caught in the traps outdoors and inside the testing units as well as later in the stables was very small. The highest abundance was examined at the end of June until mid of July 2009. The biocidal effectiveness of the insecticide-treated net was frequently tested in bioassays by using sensitive strains of laboratory insects (Musca domestica) once before the installation of the nets in the field and subsequently on a monthly basis. The interior of the testing box was covered with a sample of the net. After a 10 -second exposure, the paralysis rate of the testing insects was recorded in pre-defined time intervals. The T 50 value (the point of time when 50 % of the testing insects are paralyzed) was used to evaluate the effectivenes of the insecticide. The fly bioassay showed sound and persistent insecticide effectiveness during the entire testing period of five months. Even after one year in the field, the T 50 has slightly more than doubled (9 min) compared to the initial T 50 (4 min). The insecticide-treated net was easy to handle and due to its durability towards weather conditions (wind) it is considered suitable for the field. The chosen mesh size, the insecticide concentration of the examined net as well as the way of installation (free-standing) proved to be effective. Continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of the net in regions with a demonstrably higher abundance of biting midges is necessary to confirm the results that have been achieved up to now. At the same time, the obvious problem of detected and proven insecticide resistance on many cattle farms underlines the necessity of research on insecticide-free nets to fight vectors. Further research should focus on the optimization of these nets on the basis of the results that have been gathered so far...|$|R

In this way it will become clear where the management can be improved and thereby the use of antibiotics can be reduced. In the region of Utrecht 62 farms were visited to fill out a questionnaire, 31 low antibiotic use farms with a daily dosage per animal year between 1, 5 and 3, 5 and 31 high antibiotic use farms with a daily dosage per animal year between 7, 2 and 14, 7. Questions were asked about the general management of <b>calf</b> <b>rearing</b> like the supplementation of colostrum, hygiene and the treatment of diarrhea. There after young stock and housing were visually inspected and hygiene scores were conducted. The results were analyzed and compared to the general rules of <b>calf</b> <b>rearing</b> and to the antibiotics use of the farms. General calf management did not reach the rules on many of the 62 farms. For example, only 49 % of the farms had the right hygiene measures, on 63 % of the farms colostrum is given within 30 minutes and on 58 % of the farms calves were fed with antibiotic milk. The high and low antibiotic use groups showed no differences between herd size and milk production level. The high antibiotic use farms showed significant better <b>calf</b> <b>rearing</b> management concerning hygiene of the maternity barn and the calf hutches. High antibiotic use farms gave significantly more often colostrum within 30 minutes and vaccinated against Rota Corona virus against non of the low antibiotic use farms. Although the largest part of the famers act according to the literature rules, a lot of improvement can be accomplished in optimizing young stock rearing. It seems that farms with a high antibiotic use have a better <b>calf</b> <b>rearing</b> management then the low antibiotic users. This finding could be {{explained by the fact that}} high antibiotic user farmers seem to be more alert and pro-active in their management than low antibiotics user farmers. It is not known whether this relation is causative or just an effect...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{introduction}} of suckling systems in organic dairy <b>calf</b> <b>rearing</b> {{has the potential}} to enhance animal welfare in terms of ‘natural living’ and to live up to consumers' expectations about organic agriculture. This study describes the implications of suckling systems in a practical organic dairy context. Results show that farmers can successfully develop and implement a suckling system in <b>calf</b> <b>rearing.</b> The consumption of mothers' milk resulted in high weaning weights at 3 months of age. No immediate animal health problems linked to suckling systems occurred. Compared with traditional bucket feeding of milk, suckling systems resulted in increased natural behaviour such as calf-cow bonding, natural sucking behaviour and care-taking behaviour. Some farmers had difficulties accepting negative implications of suckling systems such as stress after weaning and loss of marketable milk. Although suckling of the own mother was seen as the most natural suckling system, farmers adapted their suckling system to calves suckling nurse cows. In order to implement successfully a suckling system, farmers have to step back from control and give calf and cow a chance. In the case of increasing ‘natural living’ through implementation of a suckling system, farmers should be encouraged to take enough time to accomplish this attitude change...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare microclimatic conditions in three different housing systems designed for <b>calf</b> <b>rearing</b> – individual wooden hutches, individual tarpaulin hutches and individual pens under shelter – and to evaluate the thermal comfort of calves reared in these systems. Air temperature, relative air humidity and the rectal temperature of calves (n= 324) were measured in the hutches and pens during three consecutive years. The hypothesis that the climatic conditions of different housing system designs used in <b>calf</b> <b>rearing</b> affect the thermal comfort of calves was confirmed, as the design of the individual housing systems affected microclimatic conditions and subsequently the rectal temperature of the housed calves as well. Statistically significant differences (P P < 0. 05) lower air temperature and significantly higher level of both relative air humidity and calf rectal temperature. These significantly higher rectal temperatures in both summer and in transitional periods (from March to June and from September to December) can be explained by microclimatic conditions and specifically by the combination of air temperature and the highest relative humidity that caused less comfortable microclimatic conditions for calves. The high relative humidity is probably caused by inadequate ventilation under the shelter. Therefore, new technology of calf housing under shelter could be recommended as suitable housing only if adequate ventilation is provided...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} important factors influencing animal health and general disease resistance, detailed qualitative and quantitative farm {{data were collected from}} 99 organic dairy farms in the Netherlands. Mastitis incidence and milk quality were focal points of the data collection. In this paper the results of a group of farms which rear dairy calves in suckling systems (n= 11) are presented. It was found that compared to other farms in the study (n= 88), suckling systems in <b>calf</b> <b>rearing</b> had no clear adverse effects on mastitis incidence and milk quality. In 2006 average clinical mastitis incidence on suckling farms was 14 %, on other farms 20 %. The percentage of cows with a somatic cell count less than 250, 000 at drying-off was lower (60 vs. 66 %) at suckling farms. Also immediately after calving the percentage of cows with a somatic cell count less than 250, 000 was lower (65 vs. 75 %) on suckling farms. Between other farms and suckling farms, but also within suckling farms, distinctively different attitudes to disease management prevailed. Most suckling farms recently introduced suckling systems in <b>calf</b> <b>rearing.</b> Only 1 or 2 generations of suckled heifers had been introduced into the herds up to now. In order to judge whether suckling systems have a potential to improve udder health in future dairy herds, evaluation should be carried out again once suckled heifers constitute the majority of the herd...|$|E
40|$|Maternal behaviour, {{interactions}} and contact between {{cow and calf}} is limited or absent in modern dairy production due to the widely use of artificial <b>calf</b> <b>rearing.</b> Introduction of suckling on a dairy farm has effects on many aspects such as calf growth, animal health, milk production, rearing costs, behaviour, welfare and naturalness etc. In a pilot study on two farms the effect of suckling systems on calf growth and milk production of dairy cows was assessed. Furthermore, the development of naturalness on the case study farms was described, {{as well as the}} motivation, for the use of suckling as rearing method, of seven farmers...|$|E

40|$|A 2 -year {{longitudinal}} {{survey was}} carried out to investigate factors affecting milk yield in crossbred cows on smallholder farms in and around an urban centre. Sixty farms were visited at approximately 2 -week intervals and details of milk yield, body condition score (BCS) and heart girth measurements were collected. Fifteen farms were within the town (U), 23 farms were approximately 5 km from town (SU), and 22 farms approximately 10 km from town (PU). Sources of variation in milk yield were investigated using a general linear model by a stepwise forward selection and backward elimination approach to judge important independent variables. Factors considered for {{the first step of}} formulation of the model included location (PU, SU and U), calving season, BCS at calving, at 3 months postpartum and at 6 months postpartum, calving year, herd size category, source of labour (hired and family labour), <b>calf</b> <b>rearing</b> method (bucket and partial suckling) and parity number of the cow. Daily milk yield (including milk sucked by calves) was determined by calving year (p < 0. 0001), <b>calf</b> <b>rearing</b> method (p = 0. 044) and BCS at calving (p < 0. 0001). Only BCS at calving contributed to variation in volume of milk sucked by the calf, lactation length and lactation milk yield. BCS at 3 months after calving was improved on farms where labour was hired (p = 0. 041) and BCS change from calving to 6 months was {{more than twice as likely}} to be negative on U than SU and PU farms. It was concluded that milk production was predominantly associated with BCS at calving, lactation milk yield increasing quadratically from score 1 to 3. BCS at calving may provide a simple, single indicator of the nutritional status of a cow population...|$|E
