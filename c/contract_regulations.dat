2500|$|If an {{enforceable}} agreement – {{a contract}} – exists, {{the details of}} the contract's terms matter if one party has allegedly broken the agreement. A contract's terms are what was promised. Yet {{it is up to the}} courts to construe evidence of what the parties said before a contract's conclusion, and construe the terms agreed. Construction of the contract starts with the express promises people make to one another, but also with terms found in other documents or notices that were intended to be incorporated. The general rule is that reasonable notice of the term is needed, and more notice is needed for an onerous term. The meaning of those terms must then be interpreted, and the modern approach is to construe the meaning of an agreement from the perspective of a reasonable person with knowledge of the whole context. The courts, as well as legislation, may also imply terms into contracts generally to 'fill gaps' as necessary to fulfil the reasonable expectations of the parties, or as necessary incidents to specific contracts. English law had, particularly in the late 19th century, adhered to the laissez faire principle of [...] "freedom of contract" [...] so that, in the general law of contract, people can agree to whatever terms or conditions they choose. By contrast, specific contracts, particularly for consumers, employees or tenants were built to carry a minimum core of rights, mostly deriving from statute, that aim to secure the fairness of contractual terms. The evolution of case law in the 20th century generally shows an ever-clearer distinction between general contracts among commercial parties and those between parties of unequal bargaining power, since in these groups of transaction true choice is thought to be hampered by lack of real competition in the market. Hence, some terms can be found to be unfair under statutes such as the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 or the Unfair Terms in Consumer <b>Contract</b> <b>Regulations</b> 1999 and can be removed by the courts, with the administrative assistance of the Competition and Markets Authority.|$|E

After this step, one has to set a date for the online auction and choose potential suppliers. Then the chosen suppliers should receive an invitation and after their approval, the eAgreement can be defined. Since web based auctions {{do not meet the}} same legal requirements as usual auctions do, defining the eAgreement is a very important step. An eAgreement includes, for example, the general rules of the eBidding, additional <b>contract</b> <b>regulations</b> and the terms of delivery. To make sure, that every supplier has basic know-how of an eBidding, trainings should be conducted. Once the eAgreement has also been approved by the suppliers, the eBidding can start. During a set time frame the suppliers have the chance to make bids. In most biddings, the suppliers can see their current ranking based on the given bids. The results of the eBidding are often part of an overall supplier rating, which leads to a final decision. Lastly, a final report about the eBidding event including its final results is being created.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comparative}} {{study in which}} the rights of tenderers and contractors and related procurement regulations are discussed and compared under Saudi public procurement <b>contract</b> <b>regulations</b> and those of England and Wales. This thesis does not aim to be a comprehensive comparative study, but presents examples to illustrate the issues under discussion. A central aim {{of the study is}} to consider whether Saudi public procurement <b>contract</b> <b>regulations</b> are suitable {{to protect the rights of}} tenderers and contractors and to solve their problems in the rapid development of the country. Is the Purchasing Law, in particular, able to cover the rapid development in procurement and the economy in Saudi Arabia and the world? This question is asked in order to examine the weaknesses of current procurement regulations and to explore procurement claims that the Purchasing Law fails to address tenderers' and contractors' rights and concerns. Many criticisms have been raised regarding Saudi public procurement <b>contract</b> <b>regulations,</b> especially the Saudi Purchasing Law. Although the Saudi government has called for the procurement sector to play a greater role in national development, the Purchasing Law does not support this aim. It has remained unchanged since it was enacted in 1979, despite rapid economic changes in the country. Contractors, traders, banks, and Saudi Chambers of Commerce have complained that they are too constrained by the provisions of the Purchasing Law. The ten chapters of this thesis examine the rights of procurement tenderers and contractors throughout the procedures to prepare and award a public procurement contract. In addition to identifying the principles of procurement regulations, this study investigates the rights of tenderers and contractors from the first steps of tendering procedures to the awarding of the contract and afterwards. Once the contracting authority selects a successful contractor this study highlights his rights to obtain his financial payment and to obtain remedy if the contracting authority breaches its contractual obligations. The study examines case law, procurement regulations, circulars and governmental procedures in procurement. The study results indicate that Saudi public procurement <b>contract</b> <b>regulations</b> in general and the Purchasing Law in particular are inadequate to keep pace with development requirements in the country. More specifically, the findings show that current Saudi procurement regulations are in fact obstacles to the development of the procurement sector, and a main reason for contractors' unwillingness to enter the governmental procurement market.

We consider three different forms of such regulations, namely insider protection, fixed term <b>contract</b> <b>regulations,</b> and legislation on temporary work agencies, and we present some empirical evidence as regards total, female and young employees based on a panel of nine European countries. We show that these three types of regulations have different impacts on the employment performances of those countries. Moreover, these institutions act asymmetrically along the business cycle. The most notable findings are that lower employment protection leads to the substitution of permanent employees by temporary ones with an insignificant net effect on the total; more flexible regulations on fixed term contracts have a beneficial effect on temporary as well as permanent employment among young people; flexible regulations on temporary work agencies {{have a positive impact on}} temporar...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a workforce scheduling problem {{which consists of}} determining optimal working shifts for cleaning personnel at a rail station. Trains arrive and depart according to a specified schedule and require a given amount of cleaning time from the personnel before their departure from the station. Working shifts must specify a sequence of trains to be cleaned by a worker together with corresponding cleaning times and are subject to <b>contract</b> <b>regulations</b> which impose both a minimum and a maximum duration of the shift. We model the problem as a mixed-integer program with a pseudo-polynomial number of variables and propose an exponentially sized reformulation obtained through Dantzig–Wolfe reformulation. The reformulation is strengthened by valid inequalities and used to compute lower bounds on the optimal cost. A heuristic algorithm based on column generation and variable fixing is then proposed and computationally evaluated on both a set of instances derived from real data and a larger set of randomly generated ones. The reported computational {{results show that the}} algorithm provides solutions very close to the optimal ones within 1 h of computing time...|$|E

40|$|A lthough {{labor market}} {{regulations}} are {{not among the}} most pressing issues for a low-income country such as Madagascar, they may still have distorting effects. This paper uses a number of indicators {{that have been developed}} in recent years in order to measure the regulatory burden in various countries across the world. These indicators are based both on de jure regulations and on opinion surveys among employers. De jure regulations on minimum wage, payroll taxes, and fixed-term <b>contract</b> <b>regulations</b> tend to be stricter in Madagascar than in comparator countries. Although labor market constraints are not among the most pressing for enterprises in Madagascar, {{there is some evidence that}} firms have an incentive to remain small and informal in order to avoid regulations. In the current investment climate, firms with more potential for job creation (medium-sized and innovative firms) have been less inclined than similar firms in comparator countries to create employment in the period 2002 - 2005. Moreover, the lack of skills and education of available workers is a particular issue in Madagascar for exporting and innovating firms. There is evidence that Malagasy manufacturing firms have been compensating for this lack through providing formal training to their workers...|$|E
40|$|The {{verification}} {{of the properties}} of a business process (BP) has become a significant research topic in recent years. In {{the early stages of}} development, the BP model (e. g. BPMN, EPC), the BP contract (task <b>contract,</b> <b>regulations</b> and laws, business rules), and the test objectives (requirements) are the only elements available. In order to support the modellers, automatic tools must be provided in order to check whether their business processes are in line with the BP contract. This paper proposes a new business process called the automatic test-case generator to automate the generation of test cases and verify that a BP has the intended functionality (semantic conformance). This generator is analysed, designed and implemented by taking into account the following tasks: Annotation of the BP model with the business process contract, calculation of the various data flow paths, transformation of these data flow paths into SSA form, and a modelling of a constraint satisfaction problem (constraint programming) of the BP contract for all data flow paths. The execution of this business process generates the test cases automatically. Junta de Andalucía P 08 -TIC- 04095 Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación TIN 2009 - 1371...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Selection {{of proper}} {{procurement}} route {{is important for}} project success. Among other things, the selection of procurement route decides selection of procurement procedure, contract model and compensation format. The procurement route influences the cooperation between the owner and the contractor because it decides {{who is responsible for}} the project risk. The aim of the research work was to examine whether public owners select procurement routes according to recommended practice, and what they attach importance to when making this selection. The owner of a project has to select one procurement route for the design phase and one for the execution phase. Selection of procurement route includes selection of <b>contract</b> <b>regulations,</b> pre-qualification (alternatively), procurement procedure, contract model, compensation format and incentive mechanisms (alternatively). Some of the selections are independent, but mostly they are interconnected. One selection can reduce the number of options later in the selection of procurement route. For instance, if the owner decides to implement incentive mechanisms that will influence the other choices related to compensation format. The literature has no best practice for selection of a complete procurement route, but contains descriptions of partial selections that are proper in different projects. This paper is based on three case studies carried out as a supplement to the literature study. The cases are two major road projects and a large building project i...|$|E
