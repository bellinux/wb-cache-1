40|$|National {{roundwood}} trade {{data are}} important for international reporting and are an integral and important part of roundwood flow analysis. The main objective {{of the study was}} to calculate objective national <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> for transformation of mass into cubic metres solid volume under bark (net m 3) and to propose uniform factors for main tree species. Official trade statistics data for the 2003 - 2006 period were used as raw data. Uniform proposed <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> for spruce and fir combined, beech and oak are 0. 77 t/m 3, 0. 98 t/m 3, and 1. 12 t/m 3, respectively. International <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> proposed by FAO are too low for Slovenia and consequently give higher official trade statistics data.

30|$|As seen in Fig.  3, {{during the}} first couple of months of the study, the <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> {{remained}} just above the mean, and then started to drift below. Calibrations and preventive maintenance (PM) were performed on the scanner on 5 October 2012, after which there was a decrease of approximately 4  % in <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> derived from the cylindrical phantom for that month. The <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> then began a slight shift upward. Prior to and up to the PM, there was an overall increase in the <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> of 4  %. In April of 2013, the center of rotation calibration (COR) and adjustments were made along with a second PM. Following the COR and PM, the <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> then remained relatively constant. With a few exceptions, the <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> remained below the mean staying within 1.5  %. However, for example, on 17 January 2013, four studies of the same ACR cylindrical phantom were taken at different time periods and all were above the mean. In these instances, the increase in <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> {{may be due to the}} use of the ACR phantom or may have been influenced by other constituents. Unfortunately, only one set of data was collected with the ACR phantom and on 17 January 2013, the option of obtaining the 20 -cm cylinder phantom for a direct comparison was not available.|$|R
5|$|The Japan Meteorological Agency uses 10-minute {{sustained}} winds, {{while the}} Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses 1-minute sustained winds. The <b>conversion</b> <b>factor</b> {{between the two}} is 1.14x. JMA's peak intensity for Conson was 150km/h (90mph) 10-minute sustained, or 160km/h (105mph) 1-minute sustained. The JTWC's peak intensity for Conson was 185km/h (115mph) 1-minute sustained, or 155km/h (100mph) 10-minute sustained. The National Meteorological Center of China estimated a peak intensity of 150km/h (90mph) 10-minute sustained, or 160km/h (105mph) 1-minute sustained. The Hong Kong Observatory assessed Conson to be slightly weaker than other agencies, with peak winds estimated at 130km/h (80mph) 10-minute sustained, or 150km/h (90mph) 1-minute sustained.|$|E

40|$|In 2005 the old survey "Skjervoy 3000 " trawl {{used since}} 1988 in the yearly {{northern}} shrimp survey in West Greenland waters was substituted {{with a new}} one ("Cosmos 2000 "). This paper gives preliminary results from trawl calibration experiments performed {{with the aim of}} determining size-class specific <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> for northern shrimp in order to ascertain continuity in the time series. We carried out trawl calibration experiments during the 2004 and 2005 field seasons following an experimental design proposed by Lewy et al., 2004. <b>Conversion</b> <b>factors</b> for 0. 5 mm length classes at the 95 % level of confidence are given graphically and in Appendix 1. However obtained <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> should be viewed as <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> for hauls, not density <b>conversion</b> <b>factors.</b> The reason for that distinction is that the different trawls have different wingspreads and therefore differ in the swept area for the same trawled distance. The results of the performed preliminary analyses also indicate problems in the design/analyses of the trawl calibration experiment. This will prompt further evaluation of the results since the continuity of the survey data time series depends on methodological consistency. Meanwhile we feel forced to use the estimated <b>conversion</b> <b>factors</b> however with the above mentioned reservations...|$|R
