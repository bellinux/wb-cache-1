The process was sometimes frustrating for Iommi, who often felt pressured {{to come up with}} new material: [...] "If I didn't <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything,</b> nobody would do anything."

[...] He then apologizes, saying, [...] "Sorry if I get a little Homeric at times. That's genetic, too." [...] This is an allusion to the poet Homer, who was also captivated with the nature versus nurture debate. In fact, Cal himself confesses, [...] "If you were going to devise an experiment to measure the relative influences of nature versus nurture, you couldn't <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> better than my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the Volume 4 world tour, Black Sabbath {{returned}} to Los Angeles {{to begin work}} on their next release. Pleased with the Volume 4 album, the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere, and {{returned to}} the Record Plant studio in Los Angeles. With new musical innovations of the era, the band were surprised to find that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant was replaced by a [...] "giant synthesiser". The band rented a house in Bel Air and began writing in the summer of 1973, but in part because of substance issues and fatigue, they were unable to complete any songs. [...] "Ideas weren't coming out the way they were on Volume 4 and we really got discontent" [...] Iommi said. [...] "Everybody was sitting there waiting for me to come up with something. I just couldn't think of anything. And if I didn't <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything,</b> nobody would do anything." ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{the final}} day of shooting, Jackson {{discovered}} that the scene in which Uncle Remus sings the film's signature song, [...] "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah", had not been properly blocked. According to Jackson, [...] "We all sat there in a circle with the dollars running out, and nobody <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything.</b> Then Walt suggested that they shoot Baskett in close-up, cover the lights with cardboard save for a sliver of blue sky behind his head, and then remove the cardboard from the lights when he began singing so that he would seem to be entering a bright new world of animation. Like Walt's idea for Bambi on ice, it made {{for one of the most}} memorable scenes in the film." ...|$|R
5000|$|Just {{like the}} mascot, the school colors {{are not the}} same as they were when the school was founded. In the {{beginning}} the school colors were purple and gold. Supposedly, they were [...] "borrowed" [...] from the neighboring high school and rival Jackson City School, because Breathitt County Schools have never <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> creative. But, the colors were only kept for a couple of years and were changed to red, white, and blue. Eventually (around the early 1930s), the red was dropped and the primary colors were just royal blue and white. The fact that they are royal blue and white instead of just blue and white was probably due to the rise of the University of Kentucky mens basketball program and Coach Adolph Rupp. Other variances that are still used include: LadyCats or Lady Bobcats, BatCats, VolleyCats, and Cats. There have been other variances that have been used and since been dropped like those of the sport at the front with [...] "Cats" [...] at the end. i.e. TrackCats or GolfCats. Most clubs/sports have been dropped and just use Bobcats or LadyCats. The only exception is that sometimes of Baseball (BatCats) and Volleyball (VolleyCats).|$|R

Within 2 years, the Canadian pharmacy landscape will look vastly different than it does today. I say this for several reasons. Certainly the integration of pharmacists into primary care teams and the recently expanded scopes of practice in some provinces have brought visible, posi-tive changes and movement toward “pharmacists being fully engaged in patient-oriented health care. ” 1 But the “perfect storm ” brewing in Ontario {{has the potential to}} affect pharmacy across the country to a much greater extent than we may realize.

500|$|Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "If this is torture porn, it's {{as if it}} was {{designed}} to be enjoyed by Michael Moore." [...] He closed his review saying, [...] "As usual, what gives the film whatever interest it has -- beyond satisfying the rapacious appetites of gore aficionados -- is the moral element attached to the various Rube Goldberg-style set pieces. Here, it's exemplified by a well-staged sequence in which a man must choose who lives or dies during a particularly lethal variation of musical chairs." [...] Roger Moore of Orlando Sentinel gave the film two out of five stars. He said the script [...] "has a more lyrical bent, and a more satiric bite, {{than any of the other}} Saw sequels" [...] and called the acting [...] "perfunctory on most fronts". [...] Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a negative review, writing [...] "But, really, do reformers and victims of callous health insurers really want a guy with a penchant for elaborately constructed death panels of his own to be their advocate? Elsewhere, the usual critiques apply: terrible acting, zero suspense, laughable logic and the promise of another one next year. How can we get this policy canceled?" [...] Chris Hewitt of the St. Paul Pioneer Press gave the film a negative review. He was displeased that the film offered nothing new saying, [...] "The first three Saw movies had some intriguing ideas and an unusual way of presenting them, but the three most recent films have barely bothered to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> fresh." [...] Kim Newman of Empire gave the film three out of five, stating [...] "Saw VI gets back to Saw basics in gripping, gruesome manner." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band {{recorded}} their backing tracks without Rollins, who overdubbed vocals with {{band members}} Greg Ginn (guitar) and Chuck Dukowski (bass) coaching him afterward. The most complicated vocal tracks {{ended up being}} Dukowski's [...] "What I See", {{which was supposed to}} have an improvised speech in the song's bridge but ended up having one written out by Dukowski when Rollins could not <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> that he was satisfied with, and [...] "T.V. Party", which featured backing vocals from the entire band.|$|E
5000|$|Kluster {{was founded}} by Conrad Schnitzler, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, and Dieter Moebius in 1969. Both Schnitzler and Moebius had been {{students}} of Joseph Beuys at the Düsseldorf Fine Arts Academy in the 1960s. Schnitzler and Roedelius both participated in {{the founding of the}} Zodiak Free Arts Lab in Berlin in 1968 and had worked together in the avant-garde groups Gerausche (literally [...] "Noises") and Plus/Minus. The trio first performed at the Zodiac Club in Berlin that year and were billed in early performances as Ensemble Kluster or Die Klusters. In a 1980 interview with David Elliott, Schnitzler recalled: [...] "...it all started at the [...] "Zodiac Club" [...] in 1969 because there was something THERE and Roedelius and me played with Moebius then using instruments, amps and echoes." [...] He also describes their music at the time as having [...] "A lot of feedback and all those crackling sounds." [...] In addition to violin, flute, piano, cello, percussion, and organ the trio used alarm clocks and kitchen utensils as instruments, Steven and Alan Freeman, writing in The Crack In The Cosmic Egg, describe the musicians and their music: [...] "All three were long-established musicians and radicals on the Berlin underground scene, and naturally what they would <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> was unlike <b>anything</b> heard before!" ...|$|R

He may <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> new, but it at least helps the {{production}}, which is some of the best production on the album due to Diplo’s hand in it.

Colm Murphy was tried, convicted, and then released after it was revealed that the Gardaí forged interview notes used in the case. Murphy's nephew, Sean Hoey, was also tried and found not guilty.

2500|$|The Hindi version {{received}} notably mixed responses, {{with most}} of the reviewers criticising Swanand Kirkire's lyrics. Bollywood Hungama rated the album 1.5 out of 5 saying, [...] "Robot disappoints. While Rahman himself hasn't <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> exceptional, something which is expected from him film after film; it's the lyrics that are chief culprit here. It is clear that a lot has been lost in translation here, literally so, as the song dubbing Tamil to Hindi just doesn't work here." [...] Glamsham published a positive review saying, [...] "Robot is stylishly packed sci-fi musical entertainer, exuding out multifaceted classy acts from the maestro. Its herculean effort to compile and compose a set of situational soundtracks with that extra trendy grace and poise but Robot delivers all with style, thanks to A.R Rahman's ever-reliable expertise." [...] Rediff rated the Hindi version 2.5 on 5 and commented that Robot is not Rahman's best, to say the least. The Times of India commented that [...] "On the whole, the music of Robot does not appeal. They may suit the script of the sci-film, but the audio is not impressive." ...|$|E
