40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} thermal expansion model for <b>casted</b> <b>aluminium</b> silicon carbide. Thermal expansion in the casting process {{is one of the}} most important parameters that influence the casting quality. The thermal expansion model for <b>casted</b> <b>aluminium</b> silicon carbide is developed by the squeeze casting method. A model of numbers evolved for the prediction of the unidirectional fibre and matrix reinforced composites was presented. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTEs) of aluminium silicon carbide fibres reinforced material was significantly influenced by the thermal stresses and interfaces between matrix and fibres. The thermal expansion behaviour of the <b>casted</b> <b>aluminium</b> silicon carbide fibres reinforced composite relies on the thermal expansion of the fibres, and influenced by the onset of interfacial strength and residual stress state. The validation shows a good agreement among the model and experimental result of LM 6 alloys silicon reinforces. As the result, the thermal expansion model for <b>casted</b> <b>aluminium</b> silicon carbide could predict the surface roughness of the casting product...|$|R

25|$|Early {{road signs}} were usually cast iron, {{but this was}} {{increasingly}} displaced by <b>cast</b> <b>aluminium</b> in the 1930s. Cast signs were designed to be maintained by being repainted with the raised lettering and symbol easily picked out by an untrained hand. This sort of sign was sometimes given an element of night use by the inclusion of glass reflectors. An alternative to casting and painting was vitreous enamelled sheet iron or steel. In the 1950s cast signs were quickly displaced by sheet metal (usually aluminium) coated with adhesive plastics; these could be made reflective, famously by Scotchlite. Such signs had become almost universal by the reforms of the early 1960s.|$|E

While producing <b>casts</b> of <b>aluminium</b> iron, the major influence has been to preserve {{the structure of the}} technological process parameters. The addition of V, Ti, Cr to an Fe-C-Al alloy leads to the improvement of functional and mechanical cast qualities. In this study, a method was investigated to eliminate the presence of undesirable Al 4 C 3 phases in an <b>aluminium</b> <b>cast</b> iron structure and thereby improve the production process. V and Ti additions to <b>aluminium</b> <b>cast</b> iron allow the development of FeAl- VC or TiC alloys. In particular, V or Ti contents above 5 wt. % were found to totally eliminate the presence of Al 4 C 3. In addition, preliminary work indicates that the alloy with the FeAl-VC or TiC structure reveals high oxidation resistance. The introduction of 5 wt. % chromium to <b>aluminium</b> <b>cast</b> iron strengthened the Al 4 C 3 precipitate.
