5|$|Huldrych Zwingli, {{a leading}} Protestant Reformer in Switzerland, taught three {{distinct}} baptisms: water baptism, teaching baptism (having been educated about the <b>Christian</b> <b>religion)</b> and Spirit baptism. While full baptism included all three, Zwingli {{emphasized that the}} external baptisms of water and teaching could not provide salvation. The inner baptism of the Spirit alone could save because it conferred faith. According to Zwingli, the three baptisms could be given separately; Spirit baptism could occur first or last in the sequence.|$|E
5|$|The Pilgrims were Brownist English Dissenters; {{they sought}} {{a version of}} the <b>Christian</b> <b>religion</b> without things they deemed nonessential, such as bishops or Christmas. They {{differed}} from the Puritans; the Pilgrims were stricter, and instead of seeking to reform the Church of England from within, sought to separate themselves from it. They had left England for the Netherlands because in 1608, King James I began to persecute Separatists. Among those who fled then was William Bradford.|$|E

5|$|Godwin, {{the son of}} Thomas Godwin, Bishop of Bath and Wells, {{was elected}} a student of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1578, from where he {{received}} his Bachelor of Arts (1581) and Master of Arts degrees (1584); after entering the church he gained his Bachelor (1594) and Doctor of Divinity (1596) degrees. He gained prominence (even internationally) in 1601 by publishing his Catalogue of the Bishops of England since the first planting of the <b>Christian</b> <b>Religion</b> in this Island, which enabled his rapid rise in the church hierarchy. During his life, {{he was known as}} a historian.|$|E
5|$|Helene Bresslau Schweitzer {{was born}} to the Bresslau family on January 25, 1879 in Berlin. Her {{maternal}} family was of Jewish descent, but she was baptized into the <b>Christian</b> <b>religion</b> {{as a result of}} widespread anti-semitism. The Bresslaus moved to Alsace, France when she was eleven because of a new job opportunity for her father. Her father, Harry Bresslau, began working at the University of Strasbourg and eventually became chancellor. As a result of the move, Schweitzer adopted French, becoming fluent rather quickly.|$|E

5|$|Christianity {{had been}} the {{official}} imperial religion of the Roman Empire, and the first churches were built in England {{in the second half}} of the 4th century, overseen by a hierarchy of bishops and priests. Many existing pagan shrines were converted to Christian use and few pagan sites still operated by the 5th century. The collapse of the Roman system in the late 5th century, however, brought about the end of formal <b>Christian</b> <b>religion</b> in the east of England, and the new Germanic immigrants arrived with their own polytheistic gods, including Woden, Thunor and Tiw, still reflected in various English place names. Despite the resurgence of paganism in England, Christian communities still survived in more western areas such as Gloucestershire and Somerset.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona's 33-year reign was {{characterized}} by her effort to strengthen the domestic authority of the Kingdom of Imerina over subjugated provinces and preserve the political and cultural sovereignty of Madagascar. These policies were enacted {{in a context of}} increasing European influence within her kingdom and competing French and English bids for domination over the island. Early in her reign, the queen took incremental steps to distance Madagascar from the purview of European powers, first putting an end to a friendship treaty with Britain, then placing increasing restrictions on the activities of the missionaries of the London Missionary Society, who operated schools where basic education and trade skills were taught in addition to the <b>Christian</b> <b>religion.</b> In 1835 she forbade the practice of Christianity among the Malagasy population, and within a year nearly all foreigners had left her territory.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Christian</b> <b>religion</b> {{is based}} on the teachings of Jesus Christ, who lived and preached in the 1st century AD in the {{province}} of Judea of the Roman Empire. Catholic doctrine teaches that the contemporary Catholic Church is the continuation of this early Christian community established by Jesus. Christianity spread throughout the early Roman Empire, despite persecutions due to conflicts with the pagan state religion. Emperor Constantine legalised the practice of Christianity in 313, and it became the state religion in 380. Germanic invaders of Roman territory in the 5th and 6th centuries, many of whom had previously adopted Arian Christianity, eventually adopted Catholicism to ally themselves with the papacy and the monasteries.|$|E

5|$|What Hasekura said or did {{to bring}} about such a result is unknown. As later events tend to {{indicate}} {{that he and his}} descendants remained faithful Christians, Hasekura may have made an enthusiastic – and to a certain extent, disturbing – account of the greatness and might of Western countries and the <b>Christian</b> <b>religion.</b> He may also have encouraged an alliance between the Church and Date Masamune to take over the country (an idea advertised by the Franciscans while in Rome), which, in 1620 Japan, would have been a totally unrealistic proposition. Lastly, hopes of trade with Spain evaporated when Hasekura communicated that the Spanish King would not enter an agreement as long as persecutions were occurring {{in the rest of the}} country.|$|E
5|$|But {{although}} the Sermons of Swift are deficient in eloquence, and were lightly esteemed by their author, {{they must not}} be undervalued by the modern reader. They exhibit, in an eminent degree, that powerful grasp of intellect which distinguished the author above all his contemporaries. In no religious discourses can be found more sound good sense, more happy and forcible views of the immediate subject. The reasoning is not only irresistible, but managed in a mode so simple and clear, that its force is obvious to the most ordinary capacity. Upon all subjects of morality, the preacher maintains {{the character of a}} rigid and inflexible monitor; neither admitting apology for that which is wrong, nor softening the difficulty of adhering to that which is right; a stern stoicism of doctrine, that may fail in finding many converts, but leads to excellence in the few manly minds who dare to embrace it. In treating the doctrinal points of belief, (as in his Sermon upon the Trinity,) Swift systematically refuses to quit the high and pre-eminent ground which the defender of Christianity is entitled to occupy, or to submit to the test of human reason, mysteries which are placed, by their very nature, far beyond our finite capacities. Swift considered, that, in religion, as in profane science, there must be certain ultimate laws which are to be received as fundamental truths, although we are incapable of defining or analysing their nature; and he censures those divines, who, in presumptuous confidence of their own logical powers, enter into controversy upon such mysteries of faith, without considering that they give thereby the most undue advantage to the infidel. Our author wisely and consistently declared reason an incompetent judge of doctrines, of which God had declared the fact, concealing from man the manner. He contended, that he who, upon the whole, receives the <b>Christian</b> <b>religion</b> as of divine inspiration, must be contented to depend upon God's truth, and his holy word, and receive with humble faith the mysteries which are too high for comprehension. Above all, Swift points out, with his usual forcible precision, the mischievous tendency of those investigations which, while they assail one fundamental doctrine of the <b>Christian</b> <b>religion,</b> shake and endanger the whole fabric, destroy the settled faith of thousands, pervert and mislead the genius of the learned and acute, destroy and confound the religious principles of the simple and ignorant.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{developed}} his theology in his biblical commentaries {{as well as}} his sermons and treatises, but the most comprehensive expression of his views is found in his magnum opus, the Institutes of the <b>Christian</b> <b>Religion.</b> He intended that the book be used as a summary of his views on Christian theology and that it be read in conjunction with his commentaries. The various editions of that work spanned nearly his entire career as a reformer, and the successive revisions of the book show that his theology changed very little from his youth to his death. The first edition from 1536 consisted of only six chapters. The second edition, published in 1539, was three times as long because he added chapters on subjects that appear in Melanchthon's Loci Communes. In 1543, he again added new material and expanded a chapter on the Apostles' Creed. The final edition of the Institutes appeared in 1559. By then, the work consisted of four books of eighty chapters, and each book was named after statements from the creed: Book 1 on God the Creator, Book 2 on the Redeemer in Christ, Book 3 on receiving the Grace of Christ through the Holy Spirit, and Book 4 on the Society of Christ or the Church.|$|E
