40|$|In {{order to}} {{minimize}} the losses resulting from traffic crashes, Indiana developed its road safety management methods before the Highway Safety Manual and the SafetyAnalyst became available. This study includes two related but distinct components: (1) comparison of the HSM-based and Indiana methods of safety management, and (2) development of a <b>Collision</b> <b>Diagram</b> Builder (CDB) to improve current Indiana safety management tools. This study concluded that the HSM SPFs {{would need to be}} calibrated to the Indiana conditions before they could be used. Calibrating the SPFs for so-called base conditions would lead to an insufficient number of roads and, consequently, to estimates that were not trustworthy. An advanced statistical simulation of a safety management system aimed to maximize the total safety benefit was performed. The results indicate that two best performing criteria: the HSM EPDO-based criterion and the Indiana total cost of crashes criterion are equivalent and they produce the same results. It is important that the HSM provides guidance as to which screening criteria support which screening objectives because some of the HSM criteria were found inadequate for maximizing the overall safety benefit. It also was concluded that although the cost of crashes and the Index of Crash Cost and Frequency used separately proved to be good screening criteria in Indiana, the combined use of these two measures did not deliver any considerable improvement. Two {{differences were found between the}} HSM and Indiana procedures for evaluating the benefits and costs of safety projects: the infinite period of analysis and the road capacity constraint on traffic growth. The differences between the two methods were quite limited and they could be fully reconciled if the capacity constraints was relaxed in the Indiana method and a long analysis period assumed in the HSM method. A second major component of the study was to improve the current Indiana safety management tool, RoadHAT 2, by developing a computer application facilitating preparation of a so-called <b>collision</b> <b>diagram.</b> These diagrams are an important element of safety audits. The developed application reduces this time from one or two days to an hour or less. The application also provides additional tools for analyzing and visualization of crash patterns.

40|$|California, {{initiated}} a comprehensive traffic safety {{program aimed at}} reducing accidents at the highest accident locations in the city. The effort concentrated on identifying all intersections and half-mile street segments that had three or more accidents in a oneyear period. The accident rate, which is expressed in accidents per million vehicles, was calculated for each location. These locations were then prioritized, and accident patterns at the highest accident rate locations were analyzed using collision diagrams (an example is shown in Figure 1). The collision diagrams used to be prepared manually, but were recently computerized using commercially available software. Mitigation measures were identified after the analysis had been completed for each location and summarized in the city’s annual safety report. ’ Collision diagrams were used to identify the most frequent types of accidents occurring at a specific location. The most frequent pattern of accidents that {{was found to be}} correctable involved right-angle accidents. Mitigation measures such as improved corner sight distances, new traffic signals, improved traffic signal head visibility, and improved stop sign visibility were identified to reduce the frequency of such acci-dents based on the <b>collision</b> <b>diagram</b> information.

In order to continue improving roadway safety, different approaches such as alternative designs have been considered. Alternative designs for roadway facilities include J-turn for minor roads and high-speed expressway intersections, the Diverging Diamond Interchange (DDI) for freeway interchanges, or red light cameras for signalized intersections. There is limited research evaluating the safety effectiveness of recently implemented alternative designs and enforcement strategies. This dissertation focused on developing jurisdiction specific crash prediction models, calibrating existing models, and applying rigorous statistical methods to study the safety effectiveness of these new alternative treatments. This dissertation found that the DDI design replacing a conventional diamond decreased crash frequency for all severities. Fatal and injury (FI) crashes experienced a 62. 6 percent reduction. Property damage only (PDO) crashes reduced by 35. 1 percent and total (TOT) crashes decreased by 47. 9 percent. The <b>collision</b> <b>diagram</b> analysis of the DDI showed that the top two crash types were: 1) rear end collisions between right turning movements on the exit ramp at the intersection, and 2) rear end collisions on the outside crossroad approach leg to the ramp terminal. The DDI design traded a severe crash type, right angle left turn crash, with less severe rear end, sideswipe, and loss of control crash types. Wrong way crashes inside the crossroad between ramp terminals accounted for 4. 8 percent of the FI crashes occurring at the DDI. This dissertation also examined the DDI safety effect on two adjacent facilities: speed change lanes and major signalized intersections. There is no strong evidence that DDIs impacted the safety of adjacent roadway facilities, either positively or negatively. Another alternative intersection design studied in this dissertation was the J-turn intersection. The safety evaluation of the implementation of the J-turn replacing two-way stopcontrolled intersections was effective at decreasing FI crashes by 63. 8 percent and TOT crashes by 31. 2 percent. The <b>collision</b> <b>diagram</b> analysis showed that the most recurrent crashes were sideswipe with 31. 6 percent and rear end with 28. 1 percent on the main road. Red light running was also evaluated in this dissertation. The implementation of red light running cameras in Missouri resulted in a reduction of FI crashes by 7. 4 percent and increase in PDO crashes by 3. 8 percent. Additionally, right angle crashes were reduced across all severities, including 14. 5 percent for FI crashes. Rear end crashes increased by 16. 5 percent overall. The crash cost benefit results showed a positive net economic benefit of $ 35, 269 per site per year in 2001 dollars (approximately $ 47, 000 in 2015 dollars). It translated into an overall 5. 0 percent economic crash cost benefit. In addition to roadway safety, this dissertation also evaluated airfield safety. In the field of aviation, runway incursions are the incorrect presence of and aircraft, vehicle or person on an active runway designated for takeoff and landing. Runway incursions can result in property damage or loss of life through incidents leading to aircraft collisions or avoidance maneuvers.

This dissertation adapted statistical roadway safety modeling to airport airfield operations.

Thus, models were developed to estimate runway incursion frequency for hub airports in the United States.

40|$|Although the {{conventional}} {{understanding is that}} roundabouts {{have the potential to}} improve safety at intersections, particularly by reducing more severe crash types, there is limited knowledge on their safety impacts when utilized as part of an interchange system. This research utilizes multiple years of crash, traffic, and geometric data across a variety of roundabout interchange sites in Missouri to develop a two-level Empirical Bayes (EB) safety analysis at the project (entire interchange) and site-specific (ramp terminal only) levels. The results were then aggregated for both single-lane and dual-lane roundabout terminals. The project-level results for single-lane sites showed a decrease in fatal/injury crashes (FI) by 20. 3 percent, property damage only (PDO) crashes by 26. 0 percent and total crashes by 24. 5 percent. The site-specific results for single-lane roundabout terminals indicated a reduction of FI crashes by 32. 8 percent, PDO crashes by 23. 1 percent, and total crashes by 24. 4 percent. At the project-level, dual-lane roundabouts were shown to reduce FI crashes by 2. 3 percent while increasing PDO and total crashes by 16. 9 percent and 12. 2 percent, respectively. The dual-lane site-specific results indicated an increase in FI crashes by 34. 7 percent, PDO crashes by 53. 9 percent, and total crashes by 50. 0 percent at the ramp terminal specifically. This analysis directly compares observed crash data after roundabout implementation to the expected number of crashes over that time period if the roundabout were never constructed. Therefore, this indicates that single-lane roundabouts performed significantly better than their original configurations, while the dual-lane roundabout terminals were shown to be less-suitable for certain applications. Additionally, it was found that a high proportion of the roundabout crashes occurred at the exit ramp approach legs; this was illustrated in the <b>collision</b> <b>diagrams</b> and crash type distributions that were produced for the common observed crashes at both single and dual-lane roundabout terminals. As a separate part of this thesis research, an improved calibration of the Highway x Safety Manual safety performance functions of four facility types was performed using data from 2012 - 2014 to calibrate for local Missouri conditions.

In the first part the coupling of soft photon modes to a source of charged particles is studied in a classical model which can be solved completely in analytical terms. The solution corresponds to a re-summation of certain field theory diagrams. The general properties of broad resonances in dense finite temperature systems are discussed at the example of the ρ-meson in hadronic matter.

40|$|Within the {{real-time}} {{formulation of}} non-equilibrium field theory generalized transport equations are derived avoiding the standard quasiparticle approximation. They permit to include unstable particles into the transport scheme. In {{order to achieve}} a self-consistent, conserving and thermodynamically consistent description, we generalize the Baym’s Φ-functional method to genuine non-equilibrium processes. This scheme may be closed at any desired loop order of the diagrams of the functional Φ this way defining a consistent effective theory. By means of a first-order gradient approximation the corresponding Kadanoff-Baym equations are converted into a set of coupled equations. This set consists of a time-irreversible generalized kinetic equation for the slowly varying space-time part of the phase-space distributions and a retarded equation, which provides the fast micro-scale dynamics represented by the four-momentum part of the distributions. Thereby, no constraint to the mass shell of the particles is required any further and the corresponding spectral mass distributions are treated dynamically. The description naturally includes all those quantum features already inherent in the corresponding equilibrium limit (Matsubara formalism).

We study the chaotic four-body problem in Newtonian gravity assuming finite-sized particles, and we focus on interactions that produce direct collisions between any two stars. Our long-term goal is to construct an equation that gives {{the probability of a}} given collision event occurring {{over the course of the}} interaction, as a function of the total encounter energy and angular momentum as well as the numbers and properties of the particles. In previous papers, we varied the number of interacting particles and the distribution of particle radii, for all equal mass particles. Here, we focus on the effects of different combinations of particle masses. We develop an analytic formalism for calculating the time-scales for different collision scenarios to occur. Our analytic time-scales reproduce the simulated time-scales when gravitational focusing is included. We present a method for calculating the relative rates for different types of collisions to occur, assuming two different limits for the particle orbits; radial and tangential. These limits yield relative collision probabilities that bracket the probabilities we obtain directly from numerical scattering experiments, and are designed to reveal important information about the (time-averaged) trajectories of the particles as a function of the interaction parameters. Finally, we present a <b>Collision</b> Rate <b>Diagram</b> (CRD), which directly compares the predictions of our analytic rates to the simulations and quantifies the quality of the agreement.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis in physics at Luleå University of Technology {{is devoted to}} the phenomenology of compact stars, and theoretical models of their interior. Particle physics has provided fundamental concepts and details needed to develop a description of matter and the evolution of the universe. It is, however, difficult to obtain information about the properties of matter at low temperature and high density from such experiments. In this context, astrophysical observations constitute an important source of information, thanks to the high resolution of present and near-future terrestrial and space-based observatories. The density of matter in neutron stars exceeds that in atomic nuclei, and {{little is known about the}} nature of their interior. It is clear that the interaction between the smallest observed building blocks of atomic nuclei, the quarks, becomes weaker with increasing density. Matter should therefore dissolve into a state of nearly free quarks at high densities, and models of classical superconductivity advocate that this state is a superconductor. The argument for this is simple: a low-temperature Fermi system with a weak attractive interaction is unstable with respect to formation of Cooper pairs. It is not known if this state of matter exists in neutron stars, but models suggest that it is possible. The major part of the work summarised in this thesis is the development of a model of superconducting quark matter, and its consequences for the phenomenology of neutron stars and their formation in the collapse of massive stars. It is a Nambu - Jona-Lasinio model with self-consistently calculated quark masses and pairing gaps, which properly accounts for the beta-equilibrium and/or charge neutrality constraints in compact stars and heavy-ion <b>collisions.</b> Phase <b>diagrams</b> and equations of state of superconducting quark matter are presented, and the influence of different assumptions about the effective quark interaction is investigated. The effect of neutrino untrapping in hypothetical quark cores of newborn neutron stars is investigated, and phase diagrams for quark matter with trapped neutrinos are presented. While no evidence for the presence of quark matter in neutron stars exists, it is explicitly shown that observations do not contradict this possibility. On the contrary, the presence of a quark matter core in neutron stars can overcome problems with hadronic equations of state. In contrast to the expectation from more simple model calculations, the results presented here suggest that strange quarks do not play a significant role in the physics of compact stars. While there is some room for bare strange stars, such models suffer from low maximum masses, and the presence of a hadronic shell tends to render stars with strange matter cores unstable. Regardless of the nature of matter in neutron stars, general relativity and the standard model of particle physics limit their density to < 10 ^ 16 g/cm^ 3. In the light of established theory, any object with a density exceeding this limit should be a black hole. It is suggested in this thesis that if quarks and leptons are composite objects, as suggested, e. g., by the three particle generations in the standard model, a yet unobserved class of compact objects with extremely high densities could exist. As the hypothetical pre-quark particles are called preons, these objects are named 'preon stars'. The properties of preon stars are estimated, and it is shown that their maximum mass depends on the quark compositeness energy scale. In general, the mass of these objects should not exceed that of the Earth, and their maximum size is of the order of metres. Several methods to observationally detect preon stars are discussed, notably, by gravitational lensing of gamma-ray bursts and by measuring high-frequency gravitational waves from binary systems. To have a realistic detection rate, i. e., to be observable, they must constitute a significant fraction of cold dark matter. This condition could be met if they formed in a primordial phase transition, at a temperature of the order of the quark compositeness energy scale. Some unexplained features observed in spectra of gamma-ray bursts are discussed, as they are similar to the signature expected from a preon-star gravitational lensing event. An observation of objects with these characteristics would be a direct vindication of physics beyond the standard model. Godkänd; 2007; 20070305 (ysko...|$|R
