5|$|On January 18, 2001, the Jets {{announced}} Herman Edwards {{as the new}} coach. Edwards, {{a former}} defensive back who had {{worked his way up}} through the NFL <b>coaching</b> <b>system,</b> had never served as head coach at any level. He was the first African-American Jets head coach. Edwards lost his first game, two days before the September 11 attacks. In the wake of 9/11, the NFL had to decide whether to play its games the following weekend. Testaverde and the Jets spoke out against playing on the weekend after 9/11, and the Jets were prepared to forfeit the game rather than fly. The NFL decided to move that week's games {{to the end of the}} regular season. The Jets needed to win that game, in Oakland against the Raiders, to reach the playoffs, and John Hall kicked a last-minute 53-yard field goal for a 24–22 victory and a playoff berth. Edwards was the first coach to lead the Jets to the playoffs in his first year with the team. In the playoffs, the Jets again played at Oakland. New York could not stop the Raiders' passing game, and Oakland won, 38–24.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Adherence to in-home {{exercise}} that complements outpatient physical therapy (PT) for osteoarthritis (OA) {{of the knee}} is less than ideal, with patients often performing exercises incorrectly or less frequently than prescribed. We are developing a virtual <b>coach</b> <b>system</b> designed to detect how individuals are performing their exercises and to provide individualized instruction and feedback in real-time. To assess potential endusers’ responsiveness to the user interface prior to completing the entire system, we conducted a usability study using a Wizard of Oz approach with 10 middle-aged and older adults with knee OA. These individuals completed three pairs of therapeutic exercises commonly prescribed {{as part of an}} in-home regimen for knee OA while interacting with an avatar on a computer monitor as it offered instruction and feedback using different communication styles. Study participants were willing to wear wireless sensors while exercising and were comfortable receiving instruction and feedback via the virtual <b>coach</b> <b>system.</b> Though they found the avatar’s guidance easy to follow, they were unable to differentiate its various communication styles. Nevertheless, they considered our virtual <b>coach</b> <b>system</b> potentially very useful for people performing therapeutic exercise on their own at home.

25|$|Tennis is {{yet another}} sport which {{originated}} in the United Kingdom, first originating {{in the city of}} Birmingham between 1859 and 1865 as a more open variant of the historical real tennis, or Royal tennis, often associated with the Tudor monarchy of Henry VIII of England. However, it has not flourished there in recent decades: its profile is highly dependent on the Wimbledon Championships, the most prestigious event of the global tennis calendar. After Fred Perry's Wimbledon win in 1936, no British man won the singles until Andy Murray from Scotland did so in 2013. No British woman has won at Wimbledon since Virginia Wade in 1977. In addition, Perry's victory in the US National Championships (predecessor to the modern US Open) later in 1936 was the last for any British man in a Grand Slam singles event until Murray won the US Open in 2012; Wade remains the last British woman to win such an event. The governing body of the sport is the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), which invests the vast profits from the tournament in the game in the hope of producing British champions, but a string of revamps of the <b>coaching</b> <b>system</b> have failed to raise the standard of LTA-trained players. The only British players of either sex to reach the world top 50 in recent years are Greg Rusedski, who learnt his tennis in Canada, Tim Henman and Murray, who did not pass through the LTA system either, and on the women's side Anne Keothavong and the late Elena Baltacha both slipped into the worlds top 50 during their careers. Outside of Wimbledon fortnight tennis's profile in Britain is low, and since the 2007 retirement of Rusedski and Henman is now largely dependent on Murray, the current UK number 1. Very recently (2015-), the rise of a number of other players, notably doubles specialist Jamie Murray, and younger top 50 players Laura Robson, Heather Watson, Dan Evans and Kyle Edmund has been supplemented by the spectacular rise of British women's number one Johanna Konta from a position outside the top 100 to the top ten in the world in just under eighteen months leading to October 2016. As a result, Great Britain had a top ten ranked men's singles, men's doubles and women's singles players at the same time for the first time ever.|$|E

2500|$|In 1963, Botvinnik founded his own school {{within the}} Soviet <b>coaching</b> <b>system,</b> and its {{graduates}} include world champions Anatoly Karpov, Garry Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik, and other top-class {{players such as}} Alexei Shirov, Vladimir Akopian and Jaan Ehlvest. Botvinnik was not an infallible spotter of chess talent: although {{he said of the}} 11-year-old Kasparov, [...] "The future of chess lies in the hands of this young man", he said on first seeing Karpov, [...] "The boy doesn't have a clue about chess, and there's no future at all for him in this profession." [...] But Karpov recounts fondly his youthful memories of the Botvinnik school and credits Botvinnik's training, especially the homework he assigned, with a marked improvement in his own play. Kasparov presents Botvinnik almost as a kind of father figure, going some way towards balancing the common public perception of Botvinnik as dour and aloof; and Kasparov inherited Botvinnik's emphasis on preparation, research and innovation. Botvinnik was still playing a major teaching role in his late 70s, when Kramnik entered the school, and made a favorable impression on his pupil.|$|E

40|$|Chronic {{conditions}} {{cannot be}} cured but daily behavior {{has a major}} effect on the severity of secondary problems and quality of life. Changing behavior however requires intensive support in daily life, which is not feasible with a human coach. A new coaching approach – so-called Personal <b>Coaching</b> <b>Systems</b> (PCSs) – use on-body sensing, combined with smart reasoning and context-aware feedback to support users in developing and maintaining a healthier behavior. Three different PCSs {{will be used to}} illustrate the different aspects of this approach: (1) Treatment of neck/shoulder pain. EMG patterns of the Trapezius muscles are used to estimate their level of relaxation. Personal vibrotactile feedback is given, to create awareness and enable learning when muscles are insufficiently relaxed. (2) Promoting a healthy activity pattern. Using a 3 D accelerometer to measure activity and a smartphone to provide feedback. Timing and content of the feedback are adapted real-time, using machine-learning techniques, to optimize adherence. (3) Management of stress during daily living. The level of stress is quantified using a personal model involving a combination of different sensor signals (EMG, ECG, skin conductance, respiration). Results show that Personal <b>Coaching</b> <b>Systems</b> are feasible and a promising and challenging way forward to coach people with chronic conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to develop a <b>coach</b> {{education}} <b>system</b> proposal for the Arab, Islamic country of Oman. As an emerging ‘sport-interested’ country, the lack of any <b>coach</b> education <b>system</b> of training or accreditation is one of the major obstacles confronting sport in Oman (Zayed, 2004). The current research into coach education was underpinned by globalization theory and was undertaken in two parts. First, an empirical investigation across Oman was conducted through which the realities, problems, needs and strategic ideas from those currently working in a sports coach capacity were identified. Second, in order to learn from other notable <b>coach</b> education <b>systems</b> in the world, the national systems of six countries and systems of some international sports organizations were analyzed. Three in-depth field case studies were also undertaken in Bahrain, Qatar and the UK. Four data gathering instruments were selected as methods of data collection: questionnaire (n = 109), interview (n = 80), documents analysis and research journal. Knowledge and understanding gained in these studies were used to underpin a proposal for a <b>coach</b> education <b>system</b> for Oman that included: an accreditation structure; curriculum outline; and management system. The proposal is in keeping with current sport structures, international developments in the field and cultural context of Oman. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
