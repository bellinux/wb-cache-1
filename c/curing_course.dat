Ampelotherapy continues to be offered in health clinics and spas, particularly in Europe, together with vinotherapy, a cosmetic treatment that involves rubbing grapes into the skin. Johanna Brandt, a South African doctor, popularized the grape diet as a treatment for cancer from 1925. She published about twenty pamphlets on the subject of natural remedies for health problems with her best-known publication being The Grape Cure, which {{is said to have been}} written after Brandt had cured herself of stomach cancer by following the diet.

The students were tasked with creating overexpressing mutants of their genes and designing their own original experiments to investigate the functions of those genes using the overexpression and null mutants in the second <b>CURE</b> <b>course.</b> In order to evaluate student learning gains, we employed three validated concept inventories in a pretest/posttest format and compared gains on the posttest versus the pretest with student laboratory final grades.

We also demonstrated a correlation between students earning lower grades in the Genetics laboratory and gains on the Introductory Molecular and Cell Biology Assessment (IMCA) for year 1 of the study. Students furthermore demonstrated significant gains in identifying the variable properties of experimental subjects when assessed using the Rubric for Experimental (RED) design tool.

If we assume two resonators in each ring, a maximum voltage of 250 kV per cavity are needed. Since a reasonable upper limit on the power dissipation is 35 kW per cavity [1], the minimum required shunt impedance is V / 2 P= 0. 9 M per cavity, which is quite a low value.

His unconventional production tactics and little regard for mainstream values while creating his work have been a focal point in much of his writing. His Documentary Down Orchard Street captures the gentrification, business closings and raised rents in the historic Lower East Side neighborhood in New York City. Produced by Sell, the project was pieced together by Business Owners undergoing eviction whom Sell had given disposable cameras too in order to document their experiences in the most personal manner. Additionally, Sell has trained under and worked beside Award-Winning Documentary Filmmaker Ondi Timoner on many of her recent projects including Brand: A Second Coming regarding Russell Brand.|$|R
40|$|AbstractOur {{objective}} was to compare therapeutic outcome and analyse cost-benefit of a ‘conventional’ (7 -day course of i. v. antibiotic therapy) vs. an abbreviated (2 -day i. v. antibiotic course followed by ‘switch’ to oral antibiotics) therapy for in-patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We used a multicenter prospective, randomized, parallel group with a 28 day follow-up, at the University-based teaching hospitals: The Medical Center of Louisiana in New Orleans, LA and hospitals listed in the acknowledgement. Ninety-five patients were randomized to receive either a ‘conventional’ course of intravenous antibiotic therapy with cefamandole 1 g i. v. every 6 h for 7 days (n= 37), or an abbreviated course of intravenous therapy with cefamandole (1 g i. v. every 6 h for 2 days) followed by oral therapy with cefaclor (500 mg every 8 h for 5 days). No difference {{was found in the}} clinical <b>courses,</b> <b>cure</b> rates, survival or the resolution of the chest radiograph abnormalities among the two groups. The mean duration of therapy (6 · 88 days for the conventional group compared to 7 · 30 days for the early oral therapy group) and the frequencies of overall symptomatic improvement (97 % vs. 95 %, respectively) were similar in both groups. Patients who received early oral therapy had shorter hospital stays (7 · 3 vs. 9 · 71 days, P= 0 · 01), and a lower total cost of care ($ 2953 vs. $ 5002, P< 0 · 05). It was concluded that early transition to an oral antibiotic after an abbreviated course of intravenous therapy in CAP is substantially less expensive and has comparable efficacy to conventional intravenous therapy. Altering physicians' customary management of hospitalized patients with CAP can reduce costs with no appreciable additional risk of adverse patient outcome...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Asthma and {{gastroesophageal}} reflux disease (GERD) {{have been}} closely linked, but {{the association of}} one with the other is not completely understood. Though GERD contributes to and exacerbates asthma symptoms, best management has not been established. Many asthmatics have subjective and objective findings of GERD, {{but the use of}} antireflux medication may not reduce reflux-related asthma symptoms at all. Better management of GERD may lead to better management of GERD-induced asthma. Outcomes presented in the review will be evaluated using GRADE to assess the quality of evidence each study provides. Methods: Articles for this review were chosen by relevance to the search terms “asthma” and “fundoplication”. Literature containing the relevant subject terms was evaluated, and articles were chosen for inclusion if they specifically addressed patients who underwent fundoplication for the primary indication of asthma and/or respiratory symptoms due to reflux disease. Results: The studies all showed fundoplication to be superior over antacid medication of any kind. Patients undergoing fundoplicaton showed immediate improvement and continued improvement or <b>cure</b> through the <b>course</b> of follow-up periods. Postoperatively, most patients showed reduced asthma symptoms and required fewer asthma control medications. Conclusion: Nissen fundoplication cures acid reflux in 90 percent of GERD patients, whereas medical management has only mediocre results and those results are not usually long-lived. Even though proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H 2 receptor antagonists (H 2 blockers) reduce acid production, reflux of acid and microaspiration of refluxate still occurs. This microaspiration continues to contribute to hypersensitivity of the airways. With fundoplication, the pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter is restored and further reflux is prevented, thus making fundoplication the most effective management of GERD, and of any asthma and respiratory symptoms associated with the reflux. While fundoplication does not cure or markedly improve every asthma symptom or pulmonary function test, these studies, assessed by GRADE criteria, provide good, though not excellent, evidence that fundoplication should be considered for patients with GERD-induced asthma, especially those whose symptoms interfere with daily living or those requiring use of oral corticosteroids...|$|R
