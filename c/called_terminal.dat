25|$|In 2004, the dormant {{terminal}} briefly hosted an art exhibition <b>called</b> <b>Terminal</b> 5, {{featuring the}} work of 19 artists from 10 countries. The theme of the show featured work, lectures and temporary installations drawing inspiration from the terminal's architecture — and was to run from October 1, 2004 to January 31, 2005 — though it closed abruptly after the building itself was vandalized during its opening gala. That same year, the Municipal Art Society of New York succeeded in nominating the facility to the National Trust for Historic Preservation’s list of the 11 Most Endangered Places in America.|$|E

Delta branded the terminal [...] "Easy Street" [...] and marketed this term to passengers. Today, the terminal {{is used by}} all U.S.-based carriers at the airport other than Sun Country, and by Air Canada Express and WestJet USCBP precleared flights from Canada. Terminal E was formerly the only terminal at DFW in which American Airlines had no presence, but this changed after their merger with US Airways, when they combined gates.|$|E
