500|$|The third series {{received}} generally favourable reviews. In {{review of}} the DVD release of the series, Michael Mackenzie of Home Cinema was disappointed by the [...] "complete decimation of the group around which the show effectively revolved," [...] and had reservations for the introductions of the new characters, stating [...] "despite ardent protests from both cast and crew, Tom and Adam are {{almost exactly the same}} character. The same goes for his wife Fiona, who more or less steps into Zoe's shoes (they even look similar!), and in the final episode, it becomes abundantly clear that, in the next season, Zafar Younis (Raza Jaffrey) will be taking Danny's place while ensuring that the [...] "minority" [...] <b>checkbox</b> remains ticked." [...] However, at the same time, Mackenzie thought [...] "the psychology surrounding cast changes like these is extremely interesting." [...] In terms of the storylines, the reviewer stated [...] "Spooks third season [...] is something of a step down from both its predecessors," [...] although the series [...] "has a number of fine moments." [...] Mackenzie ended up rating the series eight stars out of ten.|$|E

40|$|If an {{interactive}} {{form in the}} worldwide web requires users to select multiple answers from a given list, this can be implemented in several ways. This paper discusses an empirical study with = 106 participants, where two interface elements for choosing multiple answers (<b>checkboxes</b> and list boxes) were compared. Results showed that participants chose {{the same amount of}} options in both conditions but were faster and more satisfied using <b>checkboxes.</b> The time differences disappeared after several trials, revealing a learning effect for the list box element. As a conclusion, it can be recommended that website developers and online researchers should use <b>checkboxes</b> instead of list boxes for their online forms and questionnaires to enhance usability and user satisfaction—at least for a smaller number of options...|$|R

A new system featuring image verification was also introduced. In this system, users are asked to just click on a <b>checkbox</b> (the system will verify whether the user is a human or not, for example, with some clues such as already-known cookies or mouse movements within the ReCAPTCHA frame) or, if it fails, select one or more images from a selection of nine images.|$|E

Depending on file-sharing settings in Google Drive, users can request file uploads from individuals outside their respective company, with the storage cap initially set at 1 GB, which can be changed to 1 TB.

To determine, say, whether a <b>checkbox</b> style button is in fact checked, a script can simply call the highlight property, which would return either true or false. [...] In a similar way, objects can be analyzed via functions. For example, the number of lines in text field (another type of object) can be determined by {{a variant of the}} number function, called simply as [...] This is very useful when performing a given action on each separate line of the field.

50|$|For example, a <b>checkbox</b> {{presented}} to select files to send via FTP might use a tree view so that files can be selected {{one at a}} time, or by folder. If {{only some of the}} files in a folder are selected, then the <b>checkbox</b> for that folder would be indeterminate. Clicking on this indeterminate <b>checkbox</b> would select all or, less commonly, none of the contained files.

40|$|Quantitative {{information}} collection {{is important for}} scholars using questionnaires, since the number of administered questionnaires in a major survey is usually quite large. To develop an automatic and vast input method for questionnaires by computer vision, the authors adopt the perspective projection model in the image processing. This study presents a method to calibrate the camera used {{in the framework of}} this questionnaire input system. The distortions of the questionnaire image are derived therein so that the system is able to locate all <b>checkboxes</b> accurately. The computer software is coded with a visual programming language and is developed to extract the interiors of all <b>checkboxes</b> by seeking their edges. The experiment is designed, by reducing the errors produced by the recognized centers of some designated <b>checkboxes,</b> to determine the optimal values of various focal lengths to the image plane...|$|R

50|$|Some {{applications}} use checkboxes {{that allow}} an indeterminate state {{in addition to}} the two provided by a normal <b>checkbox.</b> This third state is shown as a square or dash in the <b>checkbox,</b> and indicates that its state is neither checked nor unchecked. This is most often used when the <b>checkbox</b> is tied to a collection of items in mixed states. The indeterminate state cannot usually be selected by the user, and switches to a checked state when activated.|$|E
