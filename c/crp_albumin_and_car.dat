40|$|Chronic {{inflammation}} is {{the cause}} of malnutrition and cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis patients. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess C Reactive Protein (CRP) as an inflammatory marker and to define the relationship between CRP and other inflammatory and nutritional factors in this group of patients. One hundred and fourteen hemodialysis patients undergoing chronic dialysis (3 times a week for at least 4 hours) in two hemodialysis centers were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Anthropometric and laboratory data including CRP, Il- 6, hemoglobin, serum ferritin, triglyceride, cholesterol, <b>albumin,</b> total protein <b>and</b> transferrin were measured. The Kt/V for adequacy of dialysis was also calculated. There was a statistically signi-ficant correlation between the mean <b>CRP</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin,</b> hemoglobin, <b>and</b> transferrin; while such relation was not found with BMI, ferritin, the length of dialysis, triceps skin fold thickness, mid arm circumference, mid arm muscle circumference, and Kt/V. We conclude that the negative relationship between <b>CRP</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin,</b> transferrin, <b>and</b> hemoglobin suggests a correlation bet-ween inflammatory and nutritional factors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cachexia is a {{state of}} {{involuntary}} weight loss common to many chronic diseases. Experimental data, showing that cachexia is related to the enhancement of acute phase response reaction, led to the new definition of cachexia that included, aside from the principal criterion of weight loss, other “minor criteria”, Amongst them are levels of C-reactive protein (<b>CRP),</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>and</b> hemoglobin. However, there is paucity of data regarding possible differences of these laboratory parameters in patients with various diseases known to be related to cachexia. Methods <b>CRP,</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>and</b> hemoglobin were evaluated in 119 patients, divided into two disease groups, hematological (ones with diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma or Hodgkin disease) and non-hematological (solid tumor patients and patients with chronic heart failure). Patients were further subdivided into two nutritional groups, cachectic and non-cachectic ones according to the principal criterion for cacxehia i. e. loss of body weight. Results We found that cachectic patients had higher levels of CRP, and lower levels of both hemoglobin <b>and</b> <b>albumin</b> compared to non-cachectic patients, regardless of the disease group they fitted. On the other hand, the group of hematological patients had lower levels of CRP primarily due to the differences found in the non-cachectic group. Higher levels of albumin were also found in the hematological group regardless of the nutritional group they fitted. Limitations of cut-off values, proposed by definition, were found, mostly regarding their relatively low sensitivity and low negative predictive value. Conclusions As expected, differences in values of routine laboratory parameters used in definition of cachexia were found between cachectic and non-cachectic patients. Their values differed between hematological and non-hematological patients both in cachectic and non-cachectic group. Cut-off levels currently used in definition of cachexia have limitations and should be further evaluated. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Plasma 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) {{deficiencies}} {{are associated}} with several diseases. The magnitude of systemic inflammatory response, as evidenced by C-reactive protein (CRP), {{is a major factor}} associated with lower 25 (OH) D. Other aspects of the systemic inflammatory response may be important in determining plasma 25 (OH) D concentrations. AIM: To examine the relationship between plasma 25 (OH) D, <b>CRP</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin</b> concentrations in two patient cohorts. METHODS: 5327 patients referred for nutritional assessment and 117 patients with critical illness were examined. Plasma 25 (OH) D concentrations were measured using standard methods. Intra and between assay imprecision was 80 mg/L; with decreasing albumin concentrations ≥ 35, 25 - 34 and < 25 g/l, median concentrations of 25 (OH) D were not significantly altered varying from 19 to 23 to 23 nmol/l. Similar relationships were also obtained in the cohort of patients with critical illness. CONCLUSION: Plasma concentrations of 25 (OH) D were independently associated with both <b>CRP</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>and</b> consistent with the systemic inflammatory response as a major confounding factor in determining vitamin D status...|$|R
40|$|Background: As the {{incidence}} of prostate cancer continues to rise steeply, there is an increasing need to identify more accurate prognostic markers for the disease. There {{is some evidence that}} a higher modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) may be associated with poorer survival in patients with prostate cancer but it is not known whether this is independent of other established prognostic factors. Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} describe the relationship between mGPS and survival in patients with prostate cancer after adjustment for other prognostic factors. Methods: Retrospective clinical series on patients in Glasgow, Scotland, for whom data from the Scottish Cancer Registry, including Gleason score, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), C-reactive protein (<b>CRP)</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin,</b> six months prior to or following the diagnosis, were included in this study. The mGPS was constructed by combining <b>CRP</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin.</b> Five-year <b>and</b> ten-year relative survival and relative excess risk of death were estimated by mGPS categories after adjusting for age, socioeconomic circumstances, Gleason score, PSA and previous in-patient bed days.

40|$|Serum amyloid P (SAP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are {{proteins}} {{involved in}} innate immunity. The expression of SAP and CRP is increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain tissue, compared to healthy controls. Although both proteins {{are found in}} cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), their origin is unclear. We investigated if increased local production of SAP and CRP in AD brain results in higher levels in CSF {{with the use of}} index values. To study this, SAP, <b>CRP,</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin</b> levels were determined in CSF and serum samples of 30 control (65 ± 11 years; 57 % female) and 140 AD subjects (65 ± 9 years; 53 % female). To correct for inter-individual differences in protein diffusion from blood to CSF, quotients (Q =CSF/serum) of SAP, <b>CRP,</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>and</b> index values (Qprotein/Qalb) were calculated. The results showed no significant differences in SAP and CRP index values between control and AD subjects, although eight percent of individual AD patients showed evidence of intrathecal SAP or CRP production using the Reiber hyperbolic model. Interestingly, the SAP index value was much lower than expected, based on its molecular size. In conclusion, these data suggest that local production of SAP and CRP in the AD brain does not substantially contribute to the CSF levels. © 2010 - IOS Press and the authors.

40|$|Auranofin, {{a member}} of a class of {{compounds}} with disease modifying activity, was given to arthritic rats to determine if it could reverse the abnormal plasma concentrations of fibronectin (Fn), C reactive protein (<b>CRP),</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin,</b> which were unaffected by treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). When auranofin was orally administered for two weeks to adjuvant induced arthritic rats it significantly inhibited swelling of the injected and non-injected paws at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg. Rocket electroimmunoassay measurement of plasma proteins in normal, arthritic, and auranofin treated arthritic rats indicated that auranofin at 10 mg/kg significantly decreased (by 77 %) the abnormally high concentration of arthritic rat plasma Fn, though it had no effect on Fn concentrations when administered to normal rats. CRP, which was raised approximately twofold above normal in arthritic rats, was reduced by 56 % after treatment of arthritic rats with auranofin at 10 mg/kg, though CRP concentrations in normal rats were unaffected by auranofin treatment. Depressed albumin concentrations in arthritic rats were significantly enhanced (by 30 %) by dosing with 10 mg/kg of auranofin. At the 3 mg/kg dose, auranofin did not significantly change plasma concentrations of Fn, <b>CRP,</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin</b> in arthritic rats. At a dose of 10 mg/kg, however, auranofin, in addition to inhibiting chronic systemic paw inflammation, also altered abnormal concentrations of plasma Fn, <b>CRP,</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin</b> in the adjuvant arthritic rat, thus distinguishing auranofin from standard NSAIDs we have previously tested...|$|R

40|$|Background: Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma {{has one of}} {{the poorest}} prognoses of all cancers. However, {{mortality}} and morbidity rates after surgical resection are 0 - 15 % and 14 - 66 %, respectively. Additionally, the 5 -year overall survival rates are reported at 22 - 40 %. These findings indicate that only selected patients achieve satisfactory beneficial effects from operative treatment. This retrospective study sought to investigate preoperatively available prognostic factors and establish a new preoperative staging system to predict survival after major hepatectomy of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. Patients and methods: We evaluated 121 consecutive patients who underwent operative exploration for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. Results: Univariate and multivariate analysis using the identified preoperative factors revealed that 4 factors (platelet-lymphocyte ratio [PLR] > 150, serum C-reactive protein [CRP] levels > 0. 5 mg/dL, albumin levels 7. 0 ng/mL) were independent prognostic factors of postoperative survival. These 4 preoperative factors were allocated 1 point each. The total score was defined as the Preoperative Prognostic Score (PPS). Patients with a PPS of 0, 1, 2, or 3 / 4 had a 5 -year survival of 84. 3 %, 51. 3 %, 46. 4 %, and 0 %, respectively. There were also differences in the 5 -year survival according to the PPS (0 vs 1 [P =. 013] and 2 vs 3 / 4 [P <. 001]).

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a series of}} observational studies that {{examine the relationship between}} the systemic inflammatory response, glucose, micronutrients concentrations and outcomes in patients with critical illness with reference to a large nutrition screen cohort. Data and stored samples were available from cohorts which had been defined previously. The critical illness cohort comprised of medical or surgical patients ≥ 18 years admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary (GRI) between September 2006 and December 2008. The nutrition screen cohort comprised samples and associated information which had been processed by the Pathological Biochemistry Department of the GRI. The samples had been received for vitamin and / or trace element assessment of patients from both GRI and other Scottish hospitals between January 2006 and March 2013. Samples had been referred to the lab for analysis of a number of variables related to nutrition, including glucose, <b>albumin,</b> C-reactive protein (<b>CRP),</b> lutein, lycopene, vitamins A, B 1, B 2, B 6, C, D and E, and zinc, selenium, copper, and manganese. Data was not available for all variables for all samples, hence studies varied in the number of observations. plasma glucose was measured in sodium floride blood sample whole-blood samples underwent for routine analysis of concentrations of lutein, lycopene, α-carotene and β-carotene, 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), α-tocopherol (vitamin E) in plasma, zinc, selenium, copper, B 1, B 2, B 6 in plasma and red cells. In Chapter 2 the relationship between glucose and markers of the systemic inflammatory response was examined in detail in patients from the critical illness cohort (n= 100). The results of this study showed that plasma glucose concentration - even within the context of tight insulin protocol - was influenced by many factors. Surgical and medical patients differed in their requirements for insulin; medical patients have higher plasma glucose and insulin administration accordingly compared with surgical patients. However, catecholamine and steroid administration were also associated with higher insulin requirements. In Chapter 3 the relationship between plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and related arginine metabolism (homoarginine, arginine, symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA)) and outcome was examined in patients from critical illness cohort (n= 104). Patients with critical illness experience metabolic disorders including catabolism and hyperglycaemia and these were associated with poor outcome. Plasma ADMA and SDMA concentrations were higher in patients with critical illness and were also associated with disease severity and mortality. In contrast, plasma homoarginine concentrations were lower in patients with critical illness and were also associated with disease severity and mortality. These results suggest that ADMA metabolism is perturbed with likely knock on effects on nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and endothelial function. There is a need for further work on in vivo dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) activity in critical illness and the effect of critical illness on the cationic amino acid transporters (CAT) -mediated exchange of ADMA between intra and extra-cellular compartments. It was proposed that ADMA and SDMA may not only be indicators of the severity of illness and may even contribute to adverse events in patients with critical illness. In Chapter 4 the relationship between markers of the systemic inflammatory response, as evidenced by <b>CRP</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin,</b> <b>and</b> mortality, in patients from critical illness cohort (n= 261) was examined. In this cohort, the combination of <b>CRP</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin</b> predicted ICU <b>and</b> hospital mortality as effectively as APACHE II. In Chapter 5 the relationship between markers of the systemic inflammatory response and plasma glucose was examined in a nutrition screen cohort (n= 5248). The results of this study showed that plasma concentrations of glucose were independently positive and negative associated with both <b>CRP</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin</b> respectively, <b>and</b> were consistent with the systemic inflammatory response as having an impact on glucose concentrations. However, such relationships were not apparent in patients with critical illness (n= 116). It was concluded that plasma concentrations of glucose were independently associated with both <b>CRP</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin,</b> <b>and</b> were consistent with the systemic inflammatory response as a determinant of its concentrations. In Chapter 6 the relationship between markers of the systemic inflammatory response and plasma concentrations of carotenoids was examined in a nutrition screen cohort (n= 1074). The results of this study showed that the clinical interpretation of plasma carotenoids requires knowledge of the magnitude of the systemic inflammatory response, even after adjustment for cholesterol. It was concluded that a reliable clinical interpretation can be made only for plasma lutein, lycopene and β-carotene if the CRP is less than 20 mg/L. In Chapter 7 the relationship between markers of the systemic inflammatory response and plasma 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) was examined in a nutrition screen cohort (n= 5327, and in patients from critical illness cohort n= 117). The results of this study showed that plasma concentrations of 25 (OH) D were independently associated with both <b>CRP</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin.</b> It was concluded that the systemic inflammatory response was a major confounding factor in determining vitamin D status. In Chapter 8 the relationship between markers of the systemic inflammatory response and plasma vitamin E (α-tocopherol) and vitamin C (ascorbic acid) was examined in a nutrition screen cohort (n= 359, n= 494 respectively and in patients from critical illness cohort n= 82). The results of this study showed that α-tocopherol/ cholesterol ratio and ascorbic acid were independently associated with both <b>CRP</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin.</b> It was concluded that the systemic inflammatory response was a major confounding factor in determining vitamin E and C status. In Chapter 9 the relationship between markers of the systemic inflammatory response and plasma zinc, selenium was examined in a nutrition screen cohort (n= 743, n= 833, respectively and in patients from the critical illness cohort n= 114). The results of this study showed that plasma concentrations of zinc were associated with both <b>CRP</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin.</b> However, the impact of the systemic inflammatory response (as evidenced by elevation of CRP concentrations) on plasma zinc concentrations could be largely adjusted by albumin concentrations. Plasma concentrations of selenium were associated with both <b>CRP</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin.</b> However, the impact of the systemic inflammatory response on plasma selenium concentrations could not be reasonably adjusted by albumin concentrations. It was concluded that plasma zinc and selenium concentrations were independently associations with <b>CRP</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin</b> as markers of systemic inflammatory response. In Chapter 10 the relationship between markers of the systemic inflammatory response and red cell zinc, selenium and copper was examined in patients from critical illness cohort (n= 125). The results of this study showed that altered red cell concentrations of zinc, selenium and copper were likely to be more reliable measures of status {{in the presence of a}} systemic inflammatory response. In Chapter 11 the relationship between markers of the systemic inflammatory response and red cell vitamins B 1, B 2 and B 6 was examined in nutrition screen cohort (n= 553, n= 251, n= 313, respectively and in patients from critical illness cohort n= 94). The results of this study showed that in contrast to plasma concentrations of B 1, B 2 and B 6, red cell concentrations do not fall as a part of the systemic inflammatory response. It was concluded that red cell concentrations of B 1, B 2 and B 6 were likely to be more reliable measures of status in the presence of a systemic inflammatory response. In summary, studies in the present thesis showed that, during the systemic inflammatory response, plasma concentration of glucose had multiple determinants other than insulin. Furthermore, in the presence of systemic inflammatory response, plasma lutein, lycopene, α-carotene and β-carotene, 25 (OH) D, C, E, zinc, selenium, and copper were unreliable, and that intracellular micronutrients concentrations such as red cell zinc, selenium, copper, B 1, B 2 and B 6, were more reliable as indicators of vitamin and trace element status in patients subject to nutrition screen and in patients with critical illness. These results have implications for the assessment of glucose and micronutrient status in the general population and for treatment in patients with critical illness...|$|R

Methods Baseline measurements of <b>CRP,</b> <b>albumin,</b> GGT, <b>and</b> HDL were available for participants with mortality follow-up (n= 13, 056). A biomarker score, ranging 0 – 4, was created by adding number of markers with abnormal values (cut-off: CRP> 10 mg/L, albumin 36 U/L, HDL Results The score was positively associated with death from all causes, cancer and circulatory disease [e. g.

The clinical hallmark of the disease is esophageal dysphagia due to parasite-induced esophageal nodules. Currently, there is limited information on the involvement of serum acute phase proteins (APPs) in the symptomatic CS. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate whether C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin (Hp) <b>and</b> <b>albumin</b> are involved in CS, and if their concentrations measured on admission reflect the severity of benign esophageal lesions. Nineteen dogs with spontaneous symptomatic esophageal spirocercosis and 7 clinically healthy dogs were studied retrospectively. The most consistently increased APP in the symptomatic dogs was Hp (95 % of the dogs), followed by CRP (68 %). The SAA concentrations were infrequently increased (5 % of the dogs), while albumin concentrations were decreased in 58 % of the affected dogs. The dogs with spirocercosis had significantly higher median concentrations of Hp (p = 0. 0001) and CRP (p = 0. 02) compared to healthy dogs. Median albumin concentrations did not differ between the two groups of dogs. The median concentrations of Hp, <b>CRP</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin</b> did not differ significantly between the dogs having a single or multiple esophageal nodules. The results of this study indicate that in symptomatic CS, Hp and CRP are significantly and consistently increased, while SAA <b>and</b> <b>albumin</b> may be of limited value as diagnostic markers.

40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} the proposal that lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) {{contributes to the}} acute phase response and thus possibly to the acute cardiac risks associated with major physical effort. Methods/Results: Fit, healthy, British army recruits were reviewed {{at the beginning and}} the end of a 10 week programme of basic training concluding with an intense 48 hour military exercise. Final recruit assessment was staggered over the last week of training, giving rise to six recruit groups, with determination of Lp(a), C reactive protein (<b>CRP),</b> fibrinogen, <b>albumin,</b> <b>and</b> total creatine kinase values from 12 hours to five days after the final exercise. A clear acute phase response was seen following the final exercise, marked by a significant increase in circulating concentrations of fibrinogen and a reduction of <b>albumin,</b> <b>and</b> a trend with non-significant increases in CRP. Conclusion: Lp(a) did not behave as an early marker of the acute response. Previous reports may have been confounded by concurrent disease in older subjects and by late sampling. Lp(a) determination for cardiovascular risk profiling is not confounded by associated physical effort. It is also unlikely that the acute risks of major physical effort are enhanced by any process involving Lp(a). ...|$|R

40|$|The {{association}} between pre-antiretroviral (ART) inflammation and immune activation and risk for incident tuberculosis (TB) after ART initiation among adults is uncertain. Nested case-control study (n = 332) within ACTG PEARLS trial of three ART regimens among 1571 HIV-infected, treatment-naïve adults in 9 countries. We compared cases (participants with incident TB diagnosed by 96 weeks) to {{a random sample}} of controls (participants who did not develop TB, stratified by country and treatment arm). We measured pre-ART C-reactive protein (CRP), EndoCab IgM, ferritin, interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin 6 (IL- 6), interferon gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP- 10), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), soluble CD 14 (sCD 14), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and CD 4 /DR+/ 38 + and CD 8 /DR+/ 38 + T cells. Markers were defined according to established cutoff definitions when available, 75 th percentile of measured values when not, and detectable versus undetectable for LPS. Using logistic regression, we measured associations between biomarkers and incident TB, adjusting for age, sex, study site, treatment arm, baseline CD 4 and log 10 viral load. We assessed the discriminatory value of biomarkers using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Seventy-seven persons (4. 9 %) developed incident TB during follow-up. Elevated baseline CRP (aOR 3. 25, 95 % CI: 1. 55 - 6. 81) and IP- 10 (aOR 1. 89, 95 % CI: 1. 05 - 3. 39), detectable plasma LPS (aOR 2. 39, 95 % CI: 1. 13 - 5. 06), and the established TB risk factors anemia and hypoalbuminemia were independently associated with incident TB. In ROC analysis, <b>CRP,</b> <b>albumin,</b> <b>and</b> LPS improved discrimination only modestly for TB risk when added to baseline routine patient characteristics including CD 4 count, body mass index, and prior TB. Incident TB occurs commonly after ART initiation. Although associated with higher post-ART TB risk, baseline CRP, IP- 10, and LPS add limited value to routine patient characteristics in discriminating who develops active TB. Besides determining ideal cutoffs for these biomarkers, additional biomarkers should be sought that predict TB disease in ART initiators...|$|R

The {{aim of the}} present study was to reveal whether type of dialysis modality (hemodialysis, HD, versus peritoneal dialysis, PD) differentially affects the immunocompetence, particularly the expression of genes involved in the immune response. Material. 87 renal transplant candidates (66 HD, 21 PD) were included in the study. Methods. The peripheral blood RNA samples were obtained with the PAXgene Blood system just before transplantation. The gene expression of CASP 3, FAS, TP 53, FOXP 3, IFNG, IL 2, IL 6, IL 8, IL 10, IL 17, IL 18, LCN 2, TGFB 1, and TNF was assessed with real-time PCR on custom-designed low density arrays (TaqMan).

We performed a prospective analysis of 19 consecutive patients with moderate-severe UC (endoscopic Mayo ≥ 2) receiving induction therapy with infliximab (5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6) at 2 centers in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, from July 2012 through March 2014. Serial serum and fecal samples were collected for 6 weeks and concentrations of infliximab, ATI, c-reactive protein (<b>CRP),</b> <b>albumin,</b> <b>and</b> fecal calprotectin were measured. Treatment success was defined as endoscopic response (≥ 1 point reduction in the endoscopic Mayo score) at week 8. Eleven patients (58 %) had an endoscopic response. The median serum concentrations of infliximab at week 6 were 8. 1 μg/mL in responders (interquartile range, 3. 0 - 13. 7 μg/mL) and 2. 9 μg/mL in nonresponders (interquartile range, 0. 01 - 5. 8 μg/mL) (P =. 03). ATIs were detected in 7 patients as early as day 18 (median, 28 d; interquartile range, 18 - 42 d). Six of the 8 nonresponders tested positive for ATIs vs 1 of 11 responders (P <. 01; odds ratio, 30. 0; 95 % CI, 2. 2 - 406. 2). Patients with a baseline concentration of CRP greater than 50 mg/L had lower drug exposure from weeks 0 to 6 (587 mg/L/d in patients {{with high levels of}} CRP vs 1361 mg/L/day in patients with low CRP; P =. 001). The median area under the curve for serum concentration of infliximab during induction therapy was 1230 mg/L/d in nonresponders vs 1352 mg/L/d in responders (P =. 65). There is a significant difference in serum concentration of infliximab at week 6 of treatment between responders and nonresponders. Early development of ATIs during induction therapy reduces the serum concentration of infliximab and is associated with nonresponse to treatment. Patients with high baseline serum levels of CRP had lower serum concentrations of infliximab. NL 39626. 018. 1...|$|R
40|$|MSc (Physiology), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Background: Fibulin- 1, an {{extracellular}} matrix component and mediator in cardiac fibrosis, {{is expressed in}} cardiac valves, heart muscles and blood vessels and may contribute to different cardiovascular pathological conditions such as hypertension, aortic valve stenosis, atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. The most conspicuous functions of fibulin- 1 include cell adhesion and cell migration within the {{extracellular matrix}} (ECM). This was found to reflect vascular dysfunction contributing {{to the development of}} fibrosis in the myocardium by means of changes in the ECM, possibly as a result of inflammation. Inflammatory mediators such as C-reactive protein (<b>CRP)</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin</b> have been investigated over the years for the role they play in the inflammatory processes. However, one inflammatory mediator, soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), only emerged as a potential biomarker in the development of sclerotic disease. SuPAR is a soluble bioactive form of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) secreted by inflammatory cells such as macrophages, endothelial cells and monocytes. The most profound functions of suPAR such as cell migration and cell adhesion {{contribute to the development of}} diseases such as infection, autoimmune diseases, cancer and atherosclerosis. Motivation and aim: This study was motivated by an awareness of the limited data on the potential link between fibulin- 1 and suPAR, along with other markers of inflammation (<b>CRP</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin).</b> We aimed to compare the levels of a marker of cardiac fibrosis (fibulin- 1) and inflammatory mediators (suPAR, <b>CRP</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin)</b> in African <b>and</b> Caucasian men and women. A second aim was to explore fibulin- 1 and its potential association with these inflammatory markers independent of haemodynamic and metabolic risk factors in a bi-ethnic cohort from South Africa. Methodology: Data from the cross-sectional SAfrEIC study (South African study regarding the role of Sex, Age and Ethnicity on Insulin sensitivity and Cardiovascular function) were used, which initially included 756 participants. Our study population comprised 290 Africans (men: n= 130; women: n= 160) and 343 Caucasians (men: n= 160; women: n= 183). We excluded HIV-infected participants (n= 115) as well as those with missing data (n= 8). Traditional cardiovascular measurements together with the relevant biochemical analyses were done. T-tests and Chi-square tests were used to compare means and proportions between groups, respectively. Single and partial correlations were performed to determine the relationship of fibulin- 1 with suPAR, <b>CRP</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin,</b> with adjustments for age. SuPAR, <b>CRP</b> <b>and</b> <b>albumin</b> were divided into tertiles to explore the association with fibulin- 1 levels, while adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Multiple regression analysis was performed to explore independent associations. Results: Participants were divided into African and Caucasian men and women due to significant interactions of the main effects of ethnicity and gender on the association of fibulin- 1 with suPAR (ethnicity: F(633) = 7. 29; p< 0. 001 and gender: F(633) = 7. 99; p< 0. 001). Fibulin- 1 levels were higher in African men (p= 0. 010), whereas CRP was higher in African women (p< 0. 001) compared to their Caucasian counterparts. In both gender groups suPAR levels were higher <b>and</b> <b>albumin</b> lower in Africans compared to Caucasians (p< 0. 006). In single regression analyses, a positive correlation existed between fibulin- 1 and suPAR in African (r= 0. 19; p= 0. 028) and Caucasian men (r= 0. 37; p< 0. 001), also in African (r= 0. 193; p= 0. 028) and Caucasian women (r= 0. 14; p= 0. 036). After adjustments were applied for age, this correlation remained in African (r= 0. 23; p= 0. 010) and Caucasian men (r= 0. 22; p= 0. 005) only. An inverse correlation was found between fibulin- 1 <b>and</b> <b>albumin</b> in African men (r=- 0. 28; p= 0. 002), but not in Caucasian men (r=- 0. 09; p= 0. 245). No significant correlation was found between fibulin- 1 and CRP in any group. Forward stepwise regression analysis was performed in men and the previous associations between fibulin- 1 and suPAR were confirmed in African and Caucasian men; along with the inverse relationship of fibulin- 1 with albumin (Adj. R 2 = 0. 217; β=– 0. 210; p= 0. 013) in African men only. Conclusion: Fibulin- 1 was positively associated with suPAR in African and Caucasian men, but not in women. We also found fibulin- 1 to be negatively associated with albumin in African men only. These results are indicative of the presence of potential subclinical low-grade inflammation as depicted by suPAR within the extracellular matrix. This low-grade inflammation may contribute to the potential onset of cardiac fibrosis or vascular sclerosis among these South African men with lower albumin levels. Master...|$|R
