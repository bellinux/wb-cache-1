5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} forms of sailing ships, but they all have certain basic things in common. Except for rotor ships using the Magnus effect, every sailing ship has a hull, rigging {{and at least one}} mast to hold up the sails that use the wind to power the ship. Ocean journeys by sailing ship can take many months, and a <b>common</b> <b>hazard</b> is becoming becalmed because of lack of wind, or being blown off course by severe storms or winds that do not allow progress in the desired direction. A severe storm could lead to shipwreck, and the loss of all hands. Sailing ships can only carry a certain quantity of supplies in their hold, so they have to plan long voyages carefully to include appropriate provisions, including fresh water.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{most likely}} that the {{explosion}} was caused by firedamp, a <b>common</b> <b>hazard</b> in coal mines when a pocket of methane gas is accidentally ignited and explodes. Firedamp {{is all the more}} hazardous because of the after effects of the explosion. Gases known as [...] "afterdamp" [...] – carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide produced by the explosion – often prove to be just as deadly and can kill miners unhurt by the explosion itself.|$|E
2500|$|With over [...] planted under vine, the Loire Valley {{is about}} two-thirds {{the size of}} the Bordeaux wine region. Due to its {{location}} and marginal climate, the overall quality of a vintage has a dramatic effect {{on the quality of the}} region's winesmore so than with other French wine regions. The most <b>common</b> <b>hazard</b> is that the cool climate will prevent the grapes from ripening fully and developing the sugars needed to balance the naturally high acidity of the grapes. During these cool vintages the Sauvignon blanc based wines are lighter in color, less fruity and have more pronounced mineral notes. The Cabernet franc based wines are also lighter in color with more vegetal or [...] "weed"-like aromas. In riper vintages, a Loire Cabernet franc will develop aromas of raspberries and lead pencil shavings.|$|E

50|$|Dust storms can {{many issues}} for {{agricultural}} industries as well. Soil erosion {{is one of}} the most <b>common</b> <b>hazards</b> and decreases arable lands. Dust and sand particles can cause severe weathering of buildings and rock formations. Nearby bodies of water may be polluted by settling dust and sand, killing aquatic organisms. Decrease in exposure to sunlight can affect plant growth, as well as decrease in infrared radiation may cause decreased temperatures.|$|R

50|$|The Mekong delta in Vietnam is farmed intensively and {{has little}} natural {{vegetation}} left. Forest cover {{is less than}} 10 percent. In the Central Highlands of Vietnam, forest cover was reduced from over 95 percent in the 1950s to around 50 percent in the mid-1990s.

50|$|In many Midwestern US {{cities where}} tornadoes are a <b>common</b> <b>hazard,</b> the {{emergency}} sirens are tested regularly at a specified time (say, noon each Saturday); while not primarily intended {{to mark the}} time, locals often check their watches when they hear this signal.

50|$|NIOSH {{recommends}} requesting an HHE if {{employees are}} sick and the cause is unknown {{or the number of}} illnesses or injuries is higher than expected in a group of employees. Requests should also be made when employees are exposed to a new hazard or a hazard unregulated by OSHA or when employees are experiencing ill health when their exposure to an agent is below the occupational exposure limits. If multiple hazardous agents or conditions are present in the workplace, an HHE request can be beneficial. <b>Common</b> <b>hazards</b> evaluated include chemicals, particulates, noise, radiation, biological agents, ergonomics, heat stress, and occupational stress.|$|R
