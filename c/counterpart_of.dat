Published by Sega, it was released alongside GX in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{quantum electrodynamics}} (QED) is the relativistic {{quantum field theory}} of electrodynamics. In essence, it describes how light and matter interact and is the first theory where full agreement between quantum mechanics and special relativity is achieved. QED mathematically describes all phenomena involving electrically charged particles interacting by means of exchange of photons and represents the quantum <b>counterpart</b> <b>of</b> classical electromagnetism giving a complete account of matter and light interaction.|$|E

5|$|The {{full extent}} of the {{clitoris}} was alluded to by Masters and Johnson in 1966, but in such a muddled fashion that the significance of their description became obscured; in 1981, the Federation of Feminist Women's Health Clinics (FFWHC) continued this process with anatomically precise illustrations identifying 18 structures of the clitoris. Despite the FFWHC's illustrations, Josephine Lowndes Sevely, in 1987, described the vagina as more of the <b>counterpart</b> <b>of</b> the penis.|$|E

5|$|Each {{particle}} {{of matter}} has a corresponding antimatter particle {{with the opposite}} electrical charge. Thus, the positron is a positively charged antielectron and the antiproton is a negatively charged equivalent of a proton. When a matter and corresponding antimatter particle meet, they annihilate each other. Because of this, along with an imbalance {{between the number of}} matter and antimatter particles, the latter are rare in the universe. The first causes of this imbalance are not yet fully understood, although theories of baryogenesis may offer an explanation. As a result, no antimatter atoms have been discovered in nature. However, in 1996 the antimatter <b>counterpart</b> <b>of</b> the hydrogen atom (antihydrogen) was synthesized at the CERN laboratory in Geneva.|$|E
5|$|Frequently, two Eye-related goddesses appear together, {{representing}} {{different aspects}} of the Eye. The juxtaposed deities often stand for the procreative and aggressive sides of the Eye's character, as Hathor and Sekhmet sometimes do. Wadjet and Nekhbet can stand for Lower and Upper Egypt, respectively, along with the Red Crown and White Crown that represent the two lands. Similarly, Mut, whose main cult center was in Thebes, sometimes served as an Upper Egyptian <b>counterpart</b> <b>of</b> Sekhmet, who was worshipped in Memphis in Lower Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, {{building}} on Wolfgang Pauli's work, Paul Dirac produced {{a model of}} the electron– the Dirac equation, consistent with relativity theory, by applying relativistic and symmetry considerations to the hamiltonian formulation of the quantum mechanics of the electro-magnetic field. In order to resolve some problems within his relativistic equation, Dirac developed in 1930 {{a model of the}} vacuum as an infinite sea of particles with negative energy, later dubbed the Dirac sea. This led him to predict the existence of a positron, the antimatter <b>counterpart</b> <b>of</b> the electron. This particle was discovered in 1932 by Carl Anderson, who proposed calling standard electrons negatrons, and using electron as a generic term to describe both the positively and negatively charged variants.|$|E

These developments left Microsoft's future support of the platform in doubt.

He continued his campaigns for debt and HIV/AIDS relief into June 2002 by making high-profile visits to Africa. Product Red, a for-profit licensed brand seeking {{to raise money for the}} Global Fund, was co-founded by Bono in 2006. The ONE Campaign, originally the US <b>counterpart</b> <b>of</b> Make Poverty History, was shaped by his efforts and vision.|$|E
5|$|The Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award is {{an annual}} award {{presented}} by the Center for the Study of Science Fiction at the University of Kansas to {{the author of the}} best short science fiction story published in English in the preceding calendar year. It is the short fiction <b>counterpart</b> <b>of</b> the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, awarded by the same organization. The award is named in honor of Theodore Sturgeon, one of the leading authors of the Golden Age of Science Fiction from 1939 to 1950. The award was established in 1987 by his heirs—including his widow, Jayne Sturgeon—and James Gunn, at the time the Director of the Center for the Study of Science Fiction.|$|E

It was the third best-selling game of June 2004 in North America, with 155,000 units, and has since sold 250,000 copies; it has also sold 127,000 units in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{left and}} right sides of the brain appear symmetrical, but they {{function}} asymmetrically. For example, the <b>counterpart</b> <b>of</b> the left-hemisphere motor area controlling the right hand is the right-hemisphere area controlling the left hand. There are, however, several important exceptions, involving language and spatial cognition. The left frontal lobe is dominant for language. If a key language area in the left hemisphere is damaged, it can leave the victim unable to speak or understand, whereas equivalent damage to the right hemisphere would cause only minor impairment to language skills.|$|E
5|$|The typical summer {{weather pattern}} is for heat-produced thermals, powered {{by either the}} Gulf or Atlantic sea breeze (and {{occasionally}} both simultaneously), to build puffy white cumulus clouds into threatening thunderheads over {{the interior of the}} Florida peninsula. Usually, the resulting storms drift slowly westward to the bay area, though they may rain themselves out before reaching Tampa if the easterly winds are light or the sea breeze from the Gulf of Mexico is too strong. Occasionally, the storms survive to move out over the Gulf of Mexico, where they can be seen at night from the beaches as spectacular light shows. Nighttime storms offshore are driven by the land-breeze front which is the dermal <b>counterpart</b> <b>of</b> the daytime sea-breeze front.|$|E
