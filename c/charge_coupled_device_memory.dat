40|$|This paper {{describes}} the modeling, design and fabrication of quarter-micron double delta doped AlGaAs/InGaAs <b>charge</b> <b>coupled</b> <b>devices</b> whose epitaxial layers and geometry were based around the device structure of commercial pHEMTs. A quasi-two-dimensional physical {{model has been}} developed to investigate the properties of this novel 2 dimensional electron gas <b>charge</b> <b>coupled</b> <b>device</b> (2 DEG-CCD). This physical model allows {{the characteristics of the}} InGaAs transport channel as well as the DC characteristics of the device to be predicted within a reasonable amount of time. This model also shows how ‘individual’ charge packets can be controllably transferred through the device when appropriate clocking voltages are applied to the gates of the CCD.

40|$|It {{has been}} found, using a <b>charge</b> <b>coupled</b> <b>device</b> {{detector}} and a novel on chip pre-binning technique, that qualitative high dispersion spectroscopy is possible {{with a small}} telescope and poor seeing. Using the 30 inch Coude telescope at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, an atlas of an M 3 giant, HR 5490 has been obtained in a new region of the spectrum i. e. λ 9748 Å - λl 0153 Å. However, more work is needed on {{the identification of the}} lines in order to verify this work and to extend the atlas. The readout noise of the <b>charge</b> <b>coupled</b> <b>device</b> camera system was found experimentally during the early stages of system development to be at most 55 electrons. Later work suggests the true figure to be closer to half this and although this is probably still greater than optimum for the <b>device,</b> the <b>charge</b> <b>coupled</b> <b>device</b> camera system has, nonetheless, demonstrated great potential as a detector for astronomical spectroscopic work particularly in the red and near infrared...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a performance analysis for star trackers that adopt Active Pixel Sensor photodetector technology. They have many advantages on <b>Charge</b> <b>Coupled</b> <b>Devices</b> such as low power consumption, single voltage supply needed (3. 3 V or 5 V), increased radiation hardness, simplified qualification procedures, capability of local reset and readout, onchip integrated timing, control, and analog-to-digital conversion. Unfortunately, their noise level {{is higher than}} in <b>Charge</b> <b>Coupled</b> <b>Devices.</b> Anyway, this effect can be compensated {{by taking advantage of}} their capability to manage different local exposure times. This allows for tracking bright stars at a faster tracking frequency than the one that is selected for <b>Charge</b> <b>Coupled</b> <b>Devices,</b> whereas a slower frequency is set for dim stars. The resulting temporal average of the number of observed stars is closer than the one of single shutter systems to the number of stars observed by <b>Charge</b> <b>Coupled</b> <b>Devices.</b> As a consequence, also the accuracy in attitude determination increases because it {{is a function of the}} number of detected stars. An analytical investigation of the attainable accuracy is discussed. All sensor noise sources are considered and their effects are evaluated as a function of the exposure time. The resulting accuracy turns out to be in the range 1 - 3 arcsec that is the one requested for low cost star sensors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{present the}} {{dedicated}} controller being developped {{in the framework}} of the OPTICON JRA 2 programme "Fast Visible Detectors for adaptive optics " [1]. The CCD developped within this programme is a highly specialized chip using E 2 V's Low light level <b>charge</b> <b>coupled</b> <b>device</b> (L 3 CCD) technology capable of outstanding capabilities [2]. It is not possible to extrapolate existing controller techniques since the chip needs radiofrequency signals (more than 10 MHz) for clocking, and gives a high frequency video output. The compactness is of prime importance {{in order to deal with}} these high frequency signals and is also important for future integration in next generation adaptive optics systems. Developping such a controller is very challenging and needs to use innovative techniques to fullfill the requirements. We will quickly summarize the JRA 2 and detector requirements, derive the controller requirements, present guidelines concept of the controller, point out the challenges of this controler.

This work investigates the SNR performance of an EMCCD operated in Non-inverted Mode (NIMO) and Inverted Mode (IMO). The theory of noise characteristics and operation modes is presented.
