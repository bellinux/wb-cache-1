25|$|Although 30. Jagd-Division was {{initially}} {{far from a}} fully established Jagdgeschwader, the formation process was sped up with RAF Bomber Command deployment in July 1943 of Window; radar-jamming tin-foil strips which had rendered the Luftwaffe radar control system ineffective. JG 300 and its sister units were the only interim <b>counter</b> <b>measure,</b> while Luftwaffe radar researchers strove to overcome this jamming.|$|E
25|$|The RB-66C was a {{specialized}} electronic reconnaissance and Electronic <b>Counter</b> <b>Measure</b> (ECM) aircraft with an expanded crew of seven, including the additional electronics warfare experts. A total of 36 of these aircraft were built {{with the additional}} crew members housed in what was the camera/bomb bay of other variants. RB-66C aircraft had distinctive wingtip pods and {{were used in the}} vicinity of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis and later over Vietnam. In 1966, these planes were renamed into EB-66C.|$|E

25|$|Tsiolkovsky's {{rocketry}} {{work was}} not fully appreciated in his lifetime, but he influenced Sergey Korolev, {{who became the}} Soviet Union's chief rocket designer under Joseph Stalin, to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles to carry nuclear weapons as a <b>counter</b> <b>measure</b> to United States bomber planes. Derivatives of Korolev's R-7 Semyorka missiles were used to launch the world's first artificial Earth satellite, Sputnik 1, on October 4, 1957, and later the first human to orbit the Earth, Yuri Gagarin in Vostok 1, on April 12, 1961.|$|E
25|$|The Skywarrior {{could carry}} up to 12,000lb (5,443kg) of {{weaponry}} in the fuselage bomb bay, which in later versions {{was used for}} sensor and camera equipment or additional fuel tanks. An AN/ASB-1A bomb-director system was initially installed, later replaced by a revised AN/ASB-7 with a slightly reshaped nose. Defensive armament was two 20mm cannons in a radar-operated tail turret designed by Westinghouse, soon removed in favor of electronic <b>counter</b> <b>measure</b> equipment. Although some bombing missions would be carried out early in the Vietnam war, most bombing would {{be carried out by}} more nimble attack and fighter bombers, and the Skywarrior would serve mostly as a tanker and electronic warfare support aircraft.|$|E
500|$|In the November–December 1999 {{edition of}} El Machete, the EPB {{addressed}} the momentum gained {{by the recent}} Vieques Navy protests, recapitulating that the independence movement had opposed {{the presence of the}} military on that island since the original residents were evicted during the 1940s. The organization then accused all politicians of the subsequent PPD/PNP administration of suffering what they called [...] "USMAIL syndrome", a willingness to cooperate with any military interest of the United States and helping the federal government prosecute those that interfered with their practices in Vieques. The group reaffirmed their belief that Rodríguez Cristóbal was tortured and murdered while in federal custody and stated that the Navy had [...] "lied [...] manipulated" [...] the public to justify their operations, failing to fulfill a promise to [...] "economically develop the island and its population, to eliminate unemployment, [...] keep the island fee of environmental damage, [...] to keep military practices at a minimum [...] return any terrain demes unnecessary." [...] The EPB expressed that they perceived that not only were neither of these fulfilled, but that the situation in Vieques had worsened since the arrival of the military, comparing it to the treatment that the federal government gave to Native Americans. Despite considering the protests an unitary event, the organization questioned if the appearance of some PNP/PPD politicians was intended to attract votes and mentioned a <b>counter</b> <b>measure</b> adopted by congressmen Inhofe and Warner, where Roosevelt Roads Base would be closed if the Navy was expelled from Vieques, as an attempt to dissuade the public. The EPB disregarded this campaign, citing that it was employing [...] "backstreet psychological techniques" [...] and underestimating the intelligence of Puerto Ricans, predicting that it would fail and warning that if the Navy continued to conduct live ammo drills in Vieques, they would respond [...] "According to the rules of military struggles. Selecting the right scenery and action." [...] The group also citicsized representative Edwin Mundo's defense of the Navy, as well as his relationship with ex-pat Raúl Alarcón, whom they blame of sabotaging the career of independentist artists such as Danny Rivera in the United States.|$|E

40|$|In family firms altruistic {{effects can}} arise {{in order to}} {{preserve}} the ownership of the firm within the family. The family firm may chose to carry or take measures against these effects. Regardless, it will lead to different agent costs. Therefore, the aims of the study were to explain how altruistic effects in family firms exert an influence on the administrative systems and possible <b>counter</b> <b>measures.</b> In order to explain the origin of altruistic effects, we built a theory which showed that the altruistic effects were followed by agent costs. The family can take measures to counteract these original effects. These <b>counter</b> <b>measures</b> gave rise to new effects. Both the <b>counter</b> <b>measures</b> and the new effects were each followed by agent costs. Rational economics will presume the family to implement <b>counter</b> <b>measures</b> if the sum of the agent costs for <b>counter</b> <b>measures</b> and new effects are lower than those caused by the original effects. However, the owner family may still prefer not to perform any <b>counter</b> <b>measures</b> even if it is unprofitable and increases the costs for the family firm. Interview guides were based on different effects of altruism, their <b>counter</b> <b>measures</b> and new effects were chosen to be studied. Five different family firms were visited and at each firm one family member who was the owner/managing director and one non-family member at higher direction level were interviewed. Generally, our study indicated that family firms do prefer to accept the effects of altruistic behaviour. Only few of them carried out <b>counter</b> <b>measures</b> to compensate for these original effects and the aim was to favour family members. For example, education and early socialisation with the firm would counteract non-optimal decisions and awareness of possible disputes would counteract an inefficient management. The board of the firm was composed of family members only {{in order to keep the}} ascendancy within the family, leading to restrictions in the selection of persons in prominent positions. Further, there were fewer alternatives when financing investments. The dissertation is written in Swedish...|$|R

The tank commander's thermal imaging (TI) night sight, the tank's operation in [...] "hunter-killer" [...] mode, the tank's missile firing capability from its main gun, and a laser missile warning and <b>counter</b> <b>measure</b> system were among the crucial upgrades that will be tested.|$|E
2500|$|Being {{one of two}} {{reconnaissance}} wings supporting SEA {{there were}} few military operations that did not involve the 460th TRW. [...] Not only did the 460th TRW provide electronic and photo reconnaissance, the Wing's electronic capabilities allowed it to provide electronic <b>counter</b> <b>measure</b> support to B-52s returning from striking targets in North Vietnam. [...] The Wing even gave support to the Cambodian military against the North Vietnam and Viet Cong forces, as well as support to US units operating inside Cambodia.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, a {{total of}} 500 {{aircraft}} were planned with options for further aircraft. Russian Air Force will have 200 single-seat and 50 twin-seat PAK FAs while Indian Air Force will get 166 single seated and 48 twin-seated FGFAs. At this stage, the Sukhoi holding is expected to carry out 80% of the work involved. Under the project terms, single-seat fighters will be assembled in Russia, while Hindustan Aeronautics will assemble two-seaters. [...] HAL negotiated a 25% share of design and development work in the FGFA programme. HAL's work share will include critical software including the mission computer, navigation systems, most of the cockpit displays, the <b>counter</b> <b>measure</b> dispensing (CMD) systems and modifying Sukhoi's prototype into fighter as per the requirement of the Indian Air Force (IAF).|$|E

2500|$|As {{an outcome}} of the [...] "Baton Convention" [...] O’Brien felt himself again driven from the party. He foresaw that the IPP, {{undermined}} by the AOH, was on a fatal radical path which would frustrate any All-Ireland Home Rule settlement. As a <b>counter</b> <b>measure</b> he established a new League, which was {{to build on the}} success his combined [...] "doctrine of conciliation" [...] with [...] "conference plus business" [...] achieved during the 1902 Land Conference with landlords and the ensuing 1903 Land Purchase Act. Following his engagement with the Irish Reform Movement 1904-5, he firmly believed all moderate unionists could still be won over to All-Ireland Home Rule. For many nationalists on the other hand, the adoption of a conciliatory approach to the [...] "hereditary enemy" [...] involved too sharp a deviation from traditional thinking.|$|E
2500|$|Guns of the Patriots {{is set in}} 2014, {{nine years}} after {{the events of the}} {{original}} Metal Gear Solid and five years after Sons of Liberty. The world's economy relies on continuous civil wars, fought by PMCs, which outnumber government military forces. PMC soldiers are equipped with nanomachines that enhance their abilities on the battlefield. The control network created through these nanomachines is called Sons of the Patriots (SOP), and Liquid Ocelot is preparing to hijack the system, later renaming it Guns of the Patriots. Snake, meanwhile, is experiencing accelerated aging that was coded in to his genes as part of a <b>counter</b> <b>measure</b> as one of the sons (clones) of Big Boss. Because of his rapid aging, he is given about a year left to live. He is now living with Dr. Hal [...] "Otacon" [...] Emmerich and Olga Gurlukovich's daughter Sunny. When his former commanding officer Roy Campbell approaches him with one last mission - to terminate Liquid - Snake accepts and is dropped into the Middle Eastern war zone where Liquid is believed to be hiding. In the aftermath of the , Raiden had drifted away from Rose, who had apparently suffered a miscarriage with their child (later revealed to be a lie) and gone to live with Campbell, and becomes a cyborg ninja fighting against the Patriots.|$|E
