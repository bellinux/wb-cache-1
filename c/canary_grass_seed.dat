30|$|The fodder {{producers}} {{cited the}} inability of market outlets to buy <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> at times and low prices offered for <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> as their main challenges in the marketing of their produce. Independent <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> traders and the bulking and processing agents mainly faced the challenges of poor quality of seeds due to improper post-harvest handling by producers. Such included inadequate drying, immature seeds and seeds mixed with chaff. The independent <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> traders experienced delay in payment when organizations bought <b>grass</b> <b>seeds</b> on contractual terms. The high cost of an independent <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> trader certificate which is issued by the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service (KEPHIS) was also cited as a challenge.|$|R

The <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> production activities {{of these organizations}} not only serve as demonstrations to the local community but also include sale of the produced <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> for income. The agents involved in processing {{were found to be}} RAE Trust, KVDA and KALRO which bulk, process and market the <b>grass</b> <b>seeds.</b> The actors involved in marketing included farmers who sell their produce to other farmers, KVDA, RAE Trust and KALRO. In addition, there are independent <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> traders who buy the <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> from the producers and sell to farmers and various non-governmental organizations. KVDA, KALRO and RAE Trust sell the <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> to fodder farmers and various organizations in Baringo and other counties such Laikipia, West Pokot and Turkana. The consumers were found to be mainly the residents of Baringo and other counties who buy <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> for planting which entails the establishment of new pastures and reseeding that involves the establishment of pastures in fields previously with pastures.|$|R
30|$|Pastoral {{households}} are increasingly practising fodder production {{in response to}} forage scarcity associated with land degradation, climate variability and change. Understanding the <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> value chain {{is a prerequisite for}} developing sustainable fodder production and guiding appropriate out-scaling in the drylands. This study investigated the producers’ perspectives on <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> production, marketing and challenges faced along the <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> value chain in Marigat Sub-County of Baringo County, Kenya. The results show that the dominant actors were the bulking and processing agents who provided inputs and were a source of <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> market to the producers. The producers preferred contractual agreements that allowed them to sell their <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> to markets of their choice. As independent <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> traders allowed for seed price negotiation, they were popular amongst the producers and thus handled the most volume of seeds marketed. Drought occurrence, inability of existing outlets to purchase <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> at times, together with low prices offered for producers’ <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> were found to be among the challenges facing the producers. There is need to strengthen the fodder groups with a possibility of registering them as cooperatives for the purpose of collective bargaining for better <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> prices.|$|R

40|$|Particle {{boards are}} an {{important}} material for furniture production. In this sector, two tasks have had priority during recent years: to reduce {{the weight of the}} panels and to reduce the formaldehyde emission. As the production methods have been {{more or less the same}} for decades, these tasks have to be tackled by reducing or replacing the raw material in the board production. In this study, the possibility of replacing wood with reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> (Phalaris arundinacea L.) to obtain a light-weight particle board has been studied. The boards studied were three-layered with a core of wood/reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> particles and a surface of 100 % wood particles. A protein-based adhesive was tested as an alternative to a UMF adhesive to reduce the formaldehyde emission. Different combinations of densities between 250 and 450 kg/m 3 were included in the study and no additional treatments were made to the raw materials. The results showed poor mechanical and swelling properties of all the tested boards regardless of the design. The main explanation of the poor properties is the poor wetting of the reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> surface by the adhesives. A pre-treatment of the reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> particles with steam, lipase enzyme or alkali is suggested to increase the wettability.

40|$|As a {{supplier}} to the furniture industry, the particleboard industry {{is searching for}} opportunities to reduce costs, weight, and formaldehyde emissions. One such opportunity is to use monocotyledons such as straw and hemp, as well as <b>grasses</b> like reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass.</b> A major problem when using reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> or other monocotyledons in combination with wood is the difference in their surface properties, leading to poor reactivity and wettability with adhesives such as melamine urea formaldehyde. To this end, either {{the surface of the}} particles must be modified in some way, or different adhesives must be used. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present adhesives, surfactants, coupling agents, and pre-treatment methods that can be used in combination with monocotyledons to improve compatibility with wood. Some of the methods have been tested on reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass.</b> The results show a wide range of strength values for the joint between wood and untreated or pre-treated reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> glued with different adhesives, with and without a surfactant and a coupling agent. Isocyanate-based adhesives provided relatively strong bonds, and polyvinyl acetate, acryl, and epoxy adhesives were also effective. The most effective method was pre-treatment followed by adhesives in combination with a coupling agent. Validerad; 2014; 20140513 (dicsan...|$|R
30|$|In the wet {{season of}} September to December 2013, {{a total of}} 7.42 tonnes of <b>grass</b> <b>seeds</b> were {{produced}} by the interviewed groups and households and only 4.65 tonnes were sold.

Their functions entailed collection of <b>grass</b> <b>seeds</b> from the producers, sorting of the collected seeds from chaff and packaging the seeds for sale. The role played by the bulking and processing agents of sorting the collected seeds from chaff shows that the producers need more training on <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> harvesting and handling practices. This may help them fetch better prices for their <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> when offered for sale as the quality of the produce will be high.|$|R

40|$|Reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass,</b> Phalaris arundinacea L., is a {{relatively}} new biomass crop in northern Europe, which produces raw material for bioenergy and paper pulp. Breeding reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass</b> for industrial purposes is under way in the absence of domestic cultivars being available. Knowledge of the extent of variation in biomass related traits is a basic requirement of the breeding programme. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe variation in biomass related traits and evaluate the relationships among the variables. Field experiment was carried out between 1994 and 1998 in Finland. Research material included wild and elite populations, which were divided into ten groups according to their origin. Biomass yield, plant fractions, shoot number, node number, leaf area and overwintering ability were measured. Panicle number, plant height and seed ripening were included to the analyses of the relationships. Results indicated the high biomass yield potential of reed <b>canary</b> <b>grass,</b> reaching over 13 t DM ha- 1 in the fourth year after establishment. Elite material and a local group from southern Finland had the highest biomass yield, whereas the northernmost local group had the lowest. Three factors established accounted for 45 % of the variance and they were defined as high biomass yield, leaf-shoot relationship and fast development. The first factor indicated positive connections among biomass yield, panicle number, plant height, straw fraction and node fraction.
