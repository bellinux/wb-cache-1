50|$|The {{focus of}} his {{research}} is molecular profiling of cancer to discover novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. It is generally believed that blood cancers are caused by chromosome translocation such as Bcr-Abl in <b>chronic</b> <b>myelogenous</b> <b>leukaemia</b> (CML), whereas solid tumors are caused by mutations in growth or tumour suppressor genes. In research which challenges the current dogma, Arul has discovered chromosome translocation in solid prostate tumours. Arul has discovered that this translocation occurs between a male hormone related gene TMPRSS2 and transcription factors of the Erythroblast transformation specific (ETS) family.|$|E

50|$|Given {{the ability}} of p130Cas/BCAR1 {{scaffold}} protein to convey and integrate different type of signals and subsequently to regulate key cellular functions such as adhesion, migration, invasion, proliferation and survival, {{the existence of a}} strong correlation between deregulated p130Cas/BCAR1 expression and cancer was inferred. Deregulated expression of p130Cas/BCAR1 has been identified in several cancer types. Altered levels of p130Cas/BCAR1 expression in cancers can result from gene amplification, transcription upregulation or changes in protein stability. Overexpression of p130Cas/BCAR1 has been detected in human breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, glioma, melanoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma and <b>chronic</b> <b>myelogenous</b> <b>leukaemia.</b> The presence of aberrant levels of hyperphosphorylated p130Cas/BCAR1 strongly promotes cell proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, angiogenesis and drug resistance. It has been demonstrated that high levels of p130Cas/BCAR1 expression in breast cancer correlate with worse prognosis, increased probability to develop metastasis and resistance to therapy. Conversely, lowering the amount of p130Cas/BCAR1 expression in ovarian, breast and prostate cancer is sufficient to block tumor growth and progression of cancer cells.|$|E
40|$|The {{tyrosine}} kinase {{activity of the}} BCR–ABL oncoprotein results in reduced apoptosis and thus prolongs survival of <b>chronic</b> <b>myelogenous</b> <b>leukaemia</b> cells. The {{tyrosine kinase}} inhibitor imatinib (formerly STI 571) was reported to selectively suppress the proliferation of BCR–ABL-positive cells. Assuming that imatinib could be included in pretransplantation conditioning therapies, we tested whether combinations of imatinib and γ-irradiation or alkylating agents such as busulfan or treosulfan would display synergistic activity in BCR–ABL-positive <b>chronic</b> <b>myelogenous</b> <b>leukaemia</b> BV 173 and EM- 3 cell lines. Further, primary cells of untreated <b>chronic</b> <b>myelogenous</b> <b>leukaemia</b> patients were assayed for colony forming ability under combination therapy with imatinib. Additionally, the cytotoxic effect of these combinations on BCR–ABL-negative cells was investigated. In the cell lines a tetrazolium based MTT assay was used to quantify growth inhibition after exposure to cytotoxic drugs alone or to combinations with imatinib. Irradiation was applied prior to exposure to imatinib. Interaction of drugs was analysed using the median-effect method of Chou and Talalay. The combination index was calculated according to the classic isobologram equation. The combination imatinib + γ-irradiation proved to be significantly synergistic over {{a broad range of}} cell growth inhibition levels in both BCR–ABL-positive cell lines and produced the strongest reduction in primary <b>chronic</b> <b>myelogenous</b> <b>leukaemia</b> colony-forming progenitor cells. Combinations of imatinib + busulfan and imatinib + treosulfan showed merely additive to antagonistic effects. Imatinib did not potentiate the effects of irradiation or cytotoxic agents in BCR–ABL-negative cells.

40|$|Abstract | Imatinib, {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of the oncogenic tyrosine kinase BCR–ABL, has shown remarkable clinical activity {{in patients with}} <b>chronic</b> <b>myelogenous</b> <b>leukaemia</b> (CML). However, this drug does not completely eradicate BCR–ABL-expressing cells from the body, and resistance to imatinib emerges. Although BCR–ABL remains an attractive therapeutic target, {{it is important to}} identify other components involved in CML pathogenesis to overcome this resistance. What have clinical trials of imatinib and studies using mouse models for BCR–ABL leukaemogenesis taught us about the functions of BCR–ABL beyond its kinase activity, and how these functions contribute to CML pathogenesis? 172 | MARCH 2005 | VOLUME 5 www. nature. com/reviews/cancer R E V I E W S <b>Chronic</b> <b>myelogenous</b> <b>leukaemia</b> (CML) results from the neoplastic transformation of a haematopoietic stem cell (FIG. 1).

40|$|The Philadelphia {{chromosome}} translocation, {{which is}} present in 90 - 95 % of <b>chronic</b> <b>myelogenous</b> leukemia patients, involves translocation of the c-abl protooncogene to chromosome 22 and is accompanied by activation of embryonic globin gene expression in the K 562 <b>chronic</b> <b>myelogenous</b> leukemia cell line.

40|$|The Bcr/Abl kinase {{has been}} {{targeted}} {{for the treatment}} of <b>chronic</b> <b>myelogenous</b> <b>leukaemia</b> (CML) by imatinib mesylate. While imatinib has been extremely effective for chronic phase CML, blast crisis CML are often resistant. New therapeutic options are therefore needed for this fatal disease. Although more common in solid tumors, increased microvessel density was also reported in <b>chronic</b> <b>myelogenous</b> <b>leukaemia</b> and was associated with a significant increase of angiogenic factors, suggesting that vascularity in hematologic malignancies is a controlled process and {{may play a role in}} the leukaemogenic process thus representing an alternative therapeutic target. Carboxyamidotriazole-orotate (CTO) is the orotate salt form of carboxyamidotriazole (CAI), an orally bioavailable signal transduction inhibitor that in vitro has been shown to possess antileukaemic activities. CTO, which has a reduced toxicity, increased oral bioavailability and stronger efficacy when compared to the parental compound, was tested in this study for its ability to affect imatinib-resistant CML tumor growth in a xenograft model. The active cross talk between endothelial cells and leukemic cells in the bone marrow involving exosomes plays an important role in modulating the process of neovascularization in CML. We have thus investigated the effects of CTO on exosome-stimulated angiogenesis. Our results indicate that CTO may be effective in targeting both cancer cell growth and the tumor microenvironment, thus suggesting a potential therapeutic utility for CTO in leukaemia patients...|$|E
