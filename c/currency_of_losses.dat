40|$|The {{depreciation}} of the Hungarian forint in 2009 left Hungarian borrowers with a skyrocketing value <b>of</b> foreign <b>currency</b> debt. The resulting losses worsened {{debt overhang}} in to debt-ridden firms and eroded bank capital. Therefore, although Hungarian banks had partially isolated their balance sheets from {{exchange rate risk}} by extending FX-denominated loans, the ensuing debt overhang in borrowing firms exposed the banks to elevated credit risk. Firms, households and banks had run up the open FX-positions hoping to profit from low foreign rates {{in the run-up to}} Euro adoption. This example of carry trade in emerging Europe motivates our analysis <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> mismatch <b>losses</b> in different sectors in the economy, and the macroconsequences <b>of</b> reallocating <b>losses</b> from the corporate to the banking sector ex post. We develop a small open economy New Keynesian DSGE model that accounts for the implications <b>of</b> domestic <b>currency</b> depreciation for corporate debt overhang and incorporates an active banking sector with financial frictions. The model, calibrated to the Hungarian economy, shows that, in periods of unanticipated depreciation, allocating currency mismatch losses to the banking sector generates a milder recession than if currency mismatch is placed at credit constrained firms. The government can intervene to reduce aggregate losses even further by recapitalizing banks and thus mitigating the effects <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> mismatch <b>losses</b> on credit supply...|$|R

50|$|A sterilized {{intervention}} against depreciation {{can only be}} effective in the medium term if the underlying cause behind the <b>currency's</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> value can be addressed. If the cause was a speculative attack based on political uncertainty this can potentially be resolved. In practice, the cause driving {{sterilized intervention}}s in the late 20th century was often that a high money supply had meant local interest rates were lower than they were internationally, creating the conditions for a carry trade. This involves market participants borrowing domestically and lending internationally {{at a higher rate}} of interest, a side effect of which is to exert downwards pressure on the currency being borrowed. Because a sterilizing intervention holds the money supply unchanged at its high level, the locally available interest rates can still be low. The carry trade therefore continues to be profitable and the central bank must intervene again if it still wants to prevent depreciation. This can only go on so long before the central bank runs out <b>of</b> foreign <b>currency</b> reserves with which to intervene.|$|R

40|$|In June-August 1997, a sharp {{devaluation}} <b>of</b> the <b>currencies</b> <b>of</b> {{the countries}} of Southeast Asia (SEA) occurred owing to the outflow of short-term capital; the Thai baht decreased in value by almost 30 percent by September, and the <b>currencies</b> <b>of</b> Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines by 15 - 20 percent. The second act of the drama began {{at the end of}} October, when share prices in Hong Kong dropped by 13 percent in just one day (October 28, 1997), once again owing to the outflow of short-term capital (the decline has totaled more than 40 percent as of the beginning of August).
