To prove the ability of a novel system emitting non-fractional controlled broadband near infrared light (Novaplus, Ultramed, Geneva, Switzerland) for non-invasive skin tightening by deep dermal heating and fibroblast stimulation Twenty volunteers were treated four times with a two-week interval between treatments. Near infrared light in the 800 nm to 1. 800 nm part of the spectrum was applied in doubled chopped pulses at an average fluence of 28 J/cm. Clinical photography and three-dimensional in vivo optical skin imaging was conduced at baseline and two weeks and three months after the fourth treatment for evaluation of the skin tightening effect. Scar depth was measured with a 3 d-profilometry attached <b>computer</b> <b>soft</b> ware (Aphrodite®). Two weeks after the forth treatment the average value of the scar depth measured by 3 d profilometry changed from 738, 4 to 587, 2; three months after the value of the same scar for each subjects showed an improvement up to 416, 7. No adverse effects were documented and global standard of compliance could be considered good.

Subjects were 6 old and 8 healthy adult person. Four songs were selected as test music, all of which are very familiar to the old. Their titles were "Furusato", "Akogareno Hawaii-kouro", "Saitarou-busi" and "Kagewositaite". They were chosen because we used them very often in our recipe (repertoire) of music therapy for old person. ESA- 16 enabled us to analyze EEG into four components of emotion; Anger/Stress, Joy, Sadness and Relaxation in a pseudo-real time manner. The experiments with ESA- 16 revealed that the old person showed a significant decrease in Anger/Stress and an increase in Joy during listening to "Furusato", and a decrease in Sadness and an increase in Relaxation while listening to "Saitarou-busi" with significance. On the other hand, no significant emotional changes were observed in the adult subjects while listening to all four music. For the explanation of these facts, we offered a proposition that the difference in emotional changes observed while listening to four test songs was produced by a large generation gap lying between the old and the adult. This generation gap was produced by the drastic cultural and educational changes since the occupation by the USA, after the unconditional surrender of Japan to the Allied Forces in 1945.

More than one hundred kinds of these constructs are recognized in smoke that is produced from saturated hydrocarbons resulted from the solution of the woods Ligno cellulose in high temperature and lack of oxygen conditions. The high poisoning potentials and carcinogenic features sixteen constructs among them are proved and observed on humans. In this research, the PAH compounds were identified and observed in a three month period after smoking and during storing among three types of smoked fishes Silver carp and Caspian sea Sefid and herring. They are the most produced and consumed smoked fish in Iran. To find the relationship between the concentrations of PAH constructs and the amount of lipid in fish, first, the amount of lipid were determined separately in the skin and flesh of 30 samples of each type. The method used was Bligh and Dyer (1959). PAH compounds derivation were made for all skin and flesh samples smoked fish using organic solvents with Soxeleh and the derived samples were injected to gas chromatography (GC) by Hamilton injectors for determining their components quality and their quantity. The height of the used column was 25 meters and its diameter was 0. 32 mm with the silica filler, nitrogen gas as carrier and flame ionization detector (FID) that are special for these constructs. For data analysis, Statistical tests were used by <b>computer</b> <b>soft</b> ware identified that the difference in the amount of lipid within the flesh and skin of each species and also among each other is significant. The largest amount was in Herrings flesh and skin, 18. 74 % in skin and 14. 47 % in flesh. The least amount in the skin 4. 19 % and the flesh 3. 10 % of Sefid. The amount in Silver carp was 13. 28 %in skin and 8. 16 % in flesh. The examination of the PAH compounds in smoked fish showed that is carcinogenic compounds; exist in these in these fish with different quantities in each. It seems that its amount {{is directly related to the}} amount of their lipid. The amount is different in flesh and skin. One of the most important reasons is the direct content of smoke and the concentration of lipid in tissues of all three types. The maintenance of the smoked fish for three months showed that most of PAH compounds were solved and their density decreased. The changes in density within time in different in each type and in flesh and skin. The amount of their receiving in human through the consumption of the smoked fish depends on the resulted density, the way and the amount of consumption and now we can determine and execute standards for the maximum dosage per day and per month regarding effective factors...|$|E

Low rates of fertilizers application, low population of onion plants per unit area, high incidence of disease and insect pests, shortage of pesticides and their adulteration characterize the onion production system under farmer’s practice. As a result the productivity of onion under farmers was low (85. 6 q/ha) compared with the national production (101 q/ha). Besides the average crop water productivity was (1. 74 kg/m 3) which were relatively low with compared to other researches on onion crop water productivity (4. 62 kg/m 3)). Although the quantity of water is similar with the requirement of onion (4, 914 m 3 /ha), but the yield obtained is low. The major constraints of onion production in the study area were shortage of irrigation water, high costs of irrigation equipments, shortage of genuine spare parts and accessories, shortage of pesticides and their adulteration, limited supply of improved onion seeds and lack of storage facilities, lack of skills and knowledge, high incidence of diseases and insect pests and weak extension and credit services. Results of N: P 2 O 5 :S, rate trial revealed that most of growth and yield parameters of onion were significantly influenced by N: P 2 O 5 :S fertilizer rates. The highest plant height (60. 1 cm), leaf length (50. 1 cm) and maturity days (142 days) were recorded in 73. 5 : 92 : 16. 95, 136. 5 : 119. 6 : 22 and 136. 5 : 119. 6 : 22 kg ha- 1 N: P 2 O 5 : S, application rates respectively. The highest bulb weight (198. 8 g), marketable yield (20. 8 t/ha), non marketable yields (0. 509 t/ha) and total bulb yield (21. 398 t/ha) were recorded offer 105 : 119. 6 : 22 kg ha- 1 N:P 2 O 5 :S application rate. Onion plants without N: P 2 O 5 :S, fertilizer applications were inferior in all growth and yield parameters. For enhancement of production and productivity of onion in Dembyia district and other similar environment, it is necessary to solve problems indicated above through training, extension activities and improving the supply of inputs. Application of N: P 2 O 5 :S fertilizer at the rate of 105 : 119. 6 : 22 N:P 2 O 5 :S kg ha- 1 was economically feasible and thus can be recommended for the production of onion in the study area. However is advised to repeat the experiment to have forceful recommendationGlobal Affairs Canad...|$|E

40|$|Finite State Machines (FSM) {{provide a}} {{powerful}} {{way to describe}} dynamic behavior of systems and components. However, the implementation of FSMs in OO languages, often suffers from maintenance problems. The State pattern described in [1] that is commonly used to implement FSMs in OO languages, also suffers from these problems. To address this issue we present an alternative approach. In addition to that a blackbox framework is presented that implements this approach. In addition to that a tool is presented that automates the configuration of our framework. The tool effectively enables developers to create FSMs from a specification. Subjects: frameworks, design patterns, analysis and design methods Contact information: email: [Jilles. van. Gurp|Jan.
