5000|$|In other cases, hitpaʕel verbs are {{ordinary}} intransitive verbs; for example, התנהג [...] (to behave), structurally is {{the reciprocal}} of נהג [...] (to act), as in נְהַג בְּחָכְמָה [...] (act wisely). However, {{it is used}} sparsely, only in sayings as such, and the more common meaning of nahaɡ is to drive; for that meaning, הִתְנַהֵג [...] is not a reciprocal form, but a separate verb in effect. For example: in talking about a <b>car</b> <b>that</b> drives itself, one would say מְכוֹנִית שֶׁנּוֹהֶגֶת אֶת עַצְמָהּ [...] (a <b>car</b> <b>that</b> drives itself, using nahag), not מְכוֹנִית שֶׁמִּתְנַהֶגֶת [...] (a <b>car</b> <b>that</b> behaves, using hitnaheg).|$|R
