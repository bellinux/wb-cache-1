5|$|The authorship of the Urantia papers is disputed. Journalist Brad Gooch {{argues in}} his 2002 {{profile of the}} Urantia {{movement}} that Sadler {{was the author of}} The Urantia Book, citing similarities between some of its passages and contents of Sadler's earlier writings. Gardner believes that Sadler wrote part of the papers, but heavily edited and revised most of them. He also <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> Sadler refused to include some material provided to him for inclusion in the book, and that he plagiarized from other works. Ken Glasziou, a supporter of the Urantia Foundation, <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> statistical evidence of the text and Sadler's other works indicates that he did not write, or extensively edit, The Urantia Book.|$|E

He believes this pressure has stopped many people from supporting, or even discussing, population control. He admits that his group is unlikely to succeed, but <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> attempting to reduce the Earth's population is the only moral option.|$|E

5|$|Self-referencing is {{a feature}} {{specific}} to Kiarostami's cinema. Stephen Bransford <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> Kiarostami's films {{do not contain}} references {{to the work of}} other directors, but do include a myriad of references to his own work. Bransford believes his films are often fashioned into an ongoing dialectic: one film reflecting on and partially demystifying an earlier film.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptologist Wilfried Seipel has {{proposed}} that this pyramid was initially intended for queen Meresankh IV, whom he and Verner {{see as a}} wife of Djedkare. Seipel <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> Meresankh was finally buried in a smaller mastaba in Saqqara North after she fell into disgrace. Alternatively, Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton have proposed {{that she was a}} wife of the preceding king, Menkauhor Kaiu.|$|E
5|$|The art {{historian}} Hans J. Böker claims that Foliot began {{the construction of}} the Bishop's Chapel at Hereford Cathedral. Böker <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> the architectural style of the chapel (which was destroyed in 1737) resembled that of the German imperial chapels, and was deliberately chosen by Foliot to demonstrate his loyalty to King Henry. However most sources credit Robert of Hereford, bishop from 1079 to 1095, as the builder of the chapel.|$|E

5000|$|Critics <b>contended</b> <b>that</b> CHEERS {{would have}} paid {{families}} to expose their children to pesticides. EPA denies this, <b>contending</b> <b>that</b> because CHEERS would have only examined families who used pesticides prior to the study, CHEERS would not have increased the subject families' exposure to pesticides.|$|R

5|$|Wollstonecraft wields the English philosopher John Locke's {{definition}} of property (that is, ownership acquired through labour) against Burke's notion of inherited wealth. She <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> inheritance {{is one of}} the major impediments to the progress of European civilization, and repeatedly argues that Britain's problems are rooted in the inequity of property distribution. Although she did not advocate a totally equal distribution of wealth, she did desire one that was more equitable.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{say that}} if the {{government}} goes for the top of this range inflation could rise up to 40% through the economy. The International Monetary Fund, however, has predicted a more moderate rise in inflation of just 32 percent. As of January 2010, the official inflation rate stands at 15 percent. The cost of living in Iran, according to the Majlis Research Center, could rise by up to 60 percent. Ahmadinejad's administration <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> the negative side effects will be transient and that the projections are based on out-of-date models.|$|E
5|$|Dawkins is an atheist, and is {{well known}} for his {{criticism}} of creationism and intelligent design. In The Blind Watchmaker (1986), he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. In The God Delusion (2006), Dawkins <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion. He opposes the teaching of creationism in schools.|$|E
5000|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} supports the idea that states should control the regulatory specificities of fracking. Some <b>contend</b> <b>that</b> these exemptions are carefully analyzed. A 2004 EPA study concluded that fracking injection in coalbed methane wells “posed little or no threat to drinking water;" [...] the study has since been contraverted. and some still <b>contend</b> <b>that</b> {{there is a lack of}} funded studies to show a large scale degree of fracking fluid polluted groundwater. Many oil and gas companies <b>contend</b> <b>that</b> the regulations currently in place are sufficient.|$|R
50|$|There {{were other}} claims of foreign support: French {{journalist}} Patrick Pesnot <b>contended</b> <b>that</b> the French generals {{also had the}} support of the Bundesnachrichtendienst (West German Federal Intelligence Service) leader Reinhard Gehlen. However, General Challe himself always <b>contended</b> <b>that</b> he had never been in contact with any foreign countries in this affair.|$|R

5|$|Most {{churches in}} the {{prosperity}} movement are non-denominational and independent, though some groups have formed networks. Prosperity churches typically reject Presbyterian polity (or governance) {{and the idea that}} a pastor should be accountable to elders; it is common for pastors of prosperity churches to be the highest organizational authority figure. Critics, including Sarah Posner and Joe Conason, maintain that prosperity teachers cultivate authoritarian organizations. They argue that leaders attempt to control the lives of adherents by claiming divinely bestowed authority. Jenkins <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> prosperity theology is used as a tool to justify the high salaries of pastors.|$|E
5|$|Ruiz {{notes that}} writing {{also has the}} power to {{transform}} reality. It brings the reader back to the past, allowing the reader to comprehend myths or distorted stories told by historians. Ruiz <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> knowing the past is crucial to one's understanding of the present that takes us to postmodernism, and argues that The Feast of the Goat can thus be seen as a postmodern discourse that gives power to history recreation.|$|E
5|$|Station to Station was {{recorded}} in late 1975 at Cherokee Studios, Los Angeles. In 1981, NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray surmised that it was cut—"in 10 days of feverish activity"—when Bowie decided {{that there was no}} hope of his producing a soundtrack for The Man Who Fell to Earth. More recent scholarship <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> the album {{was recorded}} over a couple of months—with the sessions beginning in late September or early October 1975 and ending in late November—so that it was in the can before Bowie began his abortive sessions on the soundtrack.|$|E

5|$|Tham Chee Ho <b>contends</b> <b>that,</b> {{based on}} the {{objective}} test set out in Chng Suan Tze, the fear that the courts will take over responsibility for national security matters is misplaced. This is because the courts do not review the actions taken by the executive for national security purposes, but merely determine whether the situation in fact involves national security issues. The Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze reflected this by holding that what was required to preserve national security was a matter solely for executive judgment.|$|E
5|$|The {{first ten}} {{chapters}} {{are not entirely}} a direct translation of the Vangelo; Leland offers his own commentary and notes {{on a number of}} passages, and Chapter VII is Leland's incorporation of other Italian folklore material. Medievalist Robert Mathiesen <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> the Vangelo manuscript actually represents even less of Aradia, arguing that only Chapters I, II, and the first half of Chapter IV match Leland's description of the manuscript's contents, and suggests that the other material came from different texts collected by Leland through Maddalena.|$|E
5|$|The {{second book}} is largely {{devoted to the}} {{respective}} roles of faith and philosophical argument. Clement <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> while both are important, the fear of God is foremost, because through faith one receives divine wisdom. To Clement, scripture is an innately true primitive philosophy which is complemented by human reason through the Logos. Faith is voluntary, and the decision to believe is a crucial fundamental step in becoming closer to God. It is never irrational, as it is founded on {{the knowledge of the}} truth of the Logos, but all knowledge proceeds from faith, as first principles are unprovable outside a systematic structure.|$|E

5|$|While {{there is}} a general {{consensus}} on the cause and circumstances of Bhimsen's death, {{there is a}} disagreement on the exact date of his death. Baburam Acharya <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> Bhimsen attempted suicide on 28 July in his house and died nine days later on 5 August by the banks of Bishnumati; while Henry Oldfield, K.L. Pradhan, and Gyanmani Nepali contend that the suicide was attempted on 20 July and the death occurred nine days later on 28 July in his house, only after which his dead body was disposed by the banks of Bishnumati.|$|E
5|$|A {{somewhat}} similar hypothesis was advanced by astronomer John J. Matese of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2002. He <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> more comets are {{arriving in the}} inner Solar System from a particular region of the postulated Oort cloud than {{can be explained by}} the galactic tide or stellar perturbations alone, and that the most likely cause would be a Jupiter-mass object in a distant orbit. This hypothetical gas giant was nicknamed Tyche. The WISE mission, an all-sky survey using parallax measurements in order to clarify local star distances, was capable of proving or disproving the Tyche hypothesis. In 2014, NASA announced that the WISE survey had ruled out any object as they had defined it.|$|E
5|$|As discussed, the Chalkidian League {{had made}} peace with Athens in 352 BC, in clear breach of their {{alliance}} with Philip, due to their growing fear of Macedonian power. Cawkwell <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> from that moment on, Olynthos and the League were doomed. However, {{the next few years}} of Philip's reign appear to have been militarily quiet; Diodorus does not mention any activity by Philip until 349 BC. Philip did not yet make any further efforts to intervene in the Sacred War, which was to rumble on until 346 BC. In the meantime, there may have been some unrest in Macedonia; Philip executed one of his stepbrothers (sons of Amyntas III's second wife), and two more fled to Olynthos. According to Justin, this provided Philip with the pretext of attacking Olynthos and the Chalkidian League.|$|E

50|$|The schism {{between the}} two Christian wings {{centered}} {{on the status of}} traditore clergy. The Donatists <b>contended</b> <b>that</b> traditores could not be reinstated without being re-baptized and re-ordained to take office. They also <b>contended</b> <b>that</b> church rituals performed by traditores were invalid. Therefore, persons who were baptized, ordained or consecrated should not be recognized by the Church.|$|R
