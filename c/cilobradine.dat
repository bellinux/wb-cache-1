40|$|We have {{compared}} {{the effect of}} two distinct Ih inhibitors on the temporal properties of the ERG response that, as previously shown, correlates well with the HCN activation in rods. The present results confirm the notion that <b>cilobradine</b> {{is more effective than}} zatebradine in inducing bradycardia. Importantly, the doses of <b>cilobradine</b> that reduce the heart rate to values comparable to, or lower than, those obtained with higher doses of zatebradine have little effect on the frequency response of the ERG. While more potent than zatebradine in its bradycardic action, <b>cilobradine</b> appears comparatively less effective on the visual response. A possible explanation is that the affinity of <b>cilobradine</b> for the HCN channels in the heart is higher than that for the HCN channels of retinal neurons...|$|E
40|$|The {{comprehensive}} {{analysis of}} the pharmacokinetics of a drug in the early phase of clinical development (phase I) in a data-rich situation forms the basis of subsequent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses in the target population, thus enabling the development of rational dose regimens, especially for the efficient planning and execution of phase II and III trials. Pharmacokinetic analysis using the population approach includes the characterization of the quantitative relations between dosing regimen, drug concentration and time course, {{as well as the}} pharmacokinetic variability of the drug within a population. In addition, covariates (e. g. demographic and laboratory values) may be identified and quantified that account at least in part for the variability observed. In this thesis a population pharmacokinetic {{analysis of the}} I f channel blocker <b>cilobradine,</b> that was investigated in phase I clinical trials, was performed. Inhibition of the I f channel specifically reduces heart rate and thus myocardial oxygen demand, with little if any effect on myocardial contractility, left-ventricular function and blood pressure. Thus, I f channel blockers represent a promising new therapy option for the treatment of myocardial ischemia. A population pharmacokinetic model for <b>cilobradine</b> was developed using the software NONMEM ®. Data from six phase I trials were analyzed that included 2733 plasma concentrations with a variety of dosing regimens: 9 dose groups over a range of 0. 6 - 40 mg <b>cilobradine,</b> three different formulations (p. o. solution, p. o. capsule, i. v. infusion), as well as single and multiple dosing. Due to the strongly unbalanced design of the entire data set, the non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach was applied. The developed population pharmacokinetic structural sub-model was characterized by an open three-compartment structure, describing p. o. drug invasion by first-order kinetics, and i. v. short infusion (20 min) by zero-order kinetics. For the characterization of the absorption process of the p. o. capsule, a lag time was incorporated which was estimated to be 0. 154 h, ameliorating the precision of the model. Absolute bioavailability F 1 for p. o. solution or p. o. capsule was estimated to 34 % or 43 %, respectively, suggesting a high presystemic elimination of <b>cilobradine.</b> Distribution between central and shallow compartment (first distribution process) displayed administration route-dependent characteristics in the three compartment model, resulting in separate estimation of distribution volumes V 2, V 3, and the inter-compartmental clearance Q 3 for i. v. or p. o. data. The first distribution phase was faster and more pronounced after i. v. than p. o. administration. After p. o., the first distribution phase was probably masked by dominating slower processes (e. g. absorption) and thus not detectable as fast distribution phase. Typical steady state volumes, calculated from estimated population values of V 2, V 3, V 4 for p. o. or i. v., were large (95. 8 or 130 L), suggesting an extensive tissue distribution of <b>cilobradine.</b> Total clearance CL was estimated to 21. 5 L/h (= 358 mL/min), indicating a high elimination capacity for <b>cilobradine.</b> In the pharmacostatistical sub-model, two hierarchical levels were identified for the variability by random effects. The inter-individual variability &# 969; 2 was modeled with an exponential random effects term. Residual variability &# 963; 2 as the second level was established using a proportional error model. Inter-individual variability estimated for CL, F 1, central volume of distribution for i. v. (V 2 iv) and absorption rate constant (KA) was moderate (15 % to 46 %), residual variability was low (26 %). After a GAM analysis, the preselected covariates were further tested for significance using the forward inclusion and backward exclusion techniques in NONMEM ®. Only the parameter covariate relation between KA and dose was statistically significant. The relation was best described by a positive saturation function with a KA max of 0. 43 h - 1 and a dose of 0. 99 mg at 0. 5 · KA max, indicating that the relation was primarily acting in the low dose range. The incorporation of the parameter covariate relation mainly improved the model fit to the observed trough concentrations of the 0. 6 mg and 1. 25 mg dose groups from one study. However, there were neither reports on such a covariate influence, nor was there successful confirmation by external study data. This suggested that this finding did not represent typical characteristics of <b>cilobradine</b> and may thus be of minor relevance. The other demographic, laboratory or study-specific parameters did not show any statistically significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of <b>cilobradine.</b> The covariates dose, age, and alkaline phosphatase each graphically suggested a relation to the structural parameter CL, which finally did not prove to be statistically significant. This finding requires verification of the respective relations in a population with a larger range of covariate values and in the patient target population. Simulations of the data set that had been used for model development based on the final model showed sufficient predictability for the concentrations measured. The simulated median concentration-time profile reflects a slight underpredictive tendency of the model which was confirmed by the value of the median prediction error of - 4 %. Beyond this internal evaluation the final model was successfully applied to external phase I data of <b>cilobradine</b> with a different population of volunteers and partially different dose groups. This result documented the robustness and general applicability of the developed model for the prediction of <b>cilobradine</b> concentrations of different origin. The estimates of the final population pharmacokinetic model based on the external data set were rather similar to those obtained by the development data set except for the covariate relation. Furthermore, all observations were well predicted with most of them being within the 90 % prediction interval when excluding the covariate relation. In summary, in this thesis a reliable population pharmacokinetic model was developed for the I f channel blocker <b>cilobradine</b> based on complex phase I data. Its general applicability for <b>cilobradine</b> was confirmed by external evaluation using phase I data. This model may form the basis for following pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic investigations and for the development of rational dosing regimens for further clinical trials, e. g. with patients suffering from ischemia. Moreover, most of the pharmacokinetic properties of <b>cilobradine</b> revealed in this thesis were similar to other known I f channel blockers. Thus, {{the results of the present}} thesis may be used for future pharmacokinetic analyses with new structural analogues displaying physicochemical properties similar to <b>cilobradine...</b>|$|E
40|$|Sinus node inhibitors {{reduce the}} heart rate presumably by {{blocking}} the pacemaker current If in the cardiac conduction system. This pacemaker current is carried by four hyperpolar-ization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated cation (HCN) chan-nels. We tested the potential subtype-specificity of the sinus node inhibitors <b>cilobradine,</b> ivabradine, and zatebradine using cloned HCN channels. All three substances blocked the slow inward current through human HCN 1, HCN 2, HCN 3, and HCN 4 channels. There was no subtype-specificity for the steady-state block, with mean IC 50 values of 0. 99, 2. 25, and 1. 96 M for <b>cilobradine,</b> ivabradine, and zatebradine, respectively. Native If, recorded from mouse sinoatrial node cells, was slightly more efficiently blocked by <b>cilobradine</b> (IC 50 value of 0. 62 M) than were the HCN currents. The block of If in sinoatrial node cells resulted in slower and dysrhythmic spontaneous action poten-tials. The in vivo action of these blockers was analyzed using telemetric ECG recordings in mice. Each compound reduced {{the heart rate}} dose-dependently from 600 to 200 bpm with ED 50 values of 1. 2, 4. 7, and 1. 8 mg/kg for <b>cilobradine,</b> ivabra-dine, and zatebradine, respectively. -Adrenergic stimulation or forced physical activity only partly reversed this bradycardia. In addition to bradycardia, all three drugs induced increasing arrhythmia at concentrations greater than 5 mg/kg for cilobra-dine, greater than 10 mg/kg for zatebradine, or greater than 15 mg/kg for ivabradine. This dysrhythmic heart rate is character-ized by periodic fluctuations of the duration between the T and P wave, resembling a form of sick sinus syndrome in humans. Hence, all available sinus node inhibitors possess an as-yet-unrecognized proarrhythmic potential. The hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated cation current termed Ih or If is a prominent depolarizing current {{in a variety of}} neuronal and cardiac cells that sho...|$|E

This study tested the relative importance of bradycardia by comparing <b>cilobradine</b> (Cilo), a sinus node inhibitor, with a -blocker, metoprolol (Meto), in an established canine model of CHF. Dogs were chronically instrumented for hemodynamic and left ventricular (LV) volume measurements. CHF was cre-ated by daily coronary embolization via a chronically implanted coronary (left anterior descending coronary artery) catheter. After establishment of CHF, control (n 6), Meto (30 mg/day, n 5), Cilo (low) (1 mg/kg/day, n 5), or Cilo (high) (3 mg/kg/ day, n 5) was given orally for 12 weeks.

40|$|IF : 4, 868) International audienceThe {{spontaneous}} activity of cardiac tissue originates in specialized pacemaker {{cells in the}} sino-atrial node that generate autonomous rhythmic electrical impulses. A number of regions in the brain are also able to generate spontaneous rhythmic activity to control and regulate important physiological functions. The generation of pacemaker potentials relies on a complex interplay between different types of currents carried by cation channels. Among these currents, the hyperpolarization-activated current (termed I(f), cardiac pacemaker "funny" current, and I(h) in neurons) is the major component contributing to the initiation of cardiac and neuronal excitability and to the modulation of this excitability by neurotransmitters and hormones. I(f) is an inward current activated by hyperpolarization of the membrane potential and by intracellular cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP. The identification {{at the end of}} the 1990 s of a family of mammalian genes that encode for four Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic Nucleotide-gated channels, HCN 1 - 4, has made analysis of the location of these channels and the study of their biophysical properties an obtainable goal. As a result, specific agents have been developed for their ability to selectively reduce heart rate by lowering cardiac pacemaker activity where f-channels are their main natural target. These drugs include alinidine, zatebradine, <b>cilobradine,</b> ZD- 7288 and ivabradine. Recent data indicate that pharmacological tools such as W 7 and genistein, which have been used to identify some intracellular pathways involved in ionic channel modulation, also have the ability to inhibit I(f) directly. This opens new perspectives for the future development of other specific rhythm-lowering agents...|$|E
