5|$|A study <b>conducted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> United States child psychiatrist, Dr Kyle D. Pruett, {{found that}} infants between 7 and 30 months responded more favorably to {{being picked up}} by their fathers. Pruett also found that a father's {{parenting}} style is beneficial for a child's physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral development. Mothers reassure toddlers when they become frustrated while fathers encourage them to manage their frustration. This helps the children {{learn to deal with}} stress and frustration. A long-term study Pruett conducted proved that a father's active involvement with his children, from birth to adolescence, promotes greater emotional balance, stronger curiosity and a stronger sense of self-assurance in the child.|$|E
5|$|Although {{myths and}} {{speculation}} about a Terra Australis ("Southern Land") {{date back to}} antiquity, Antarctica is noted as the last region on Earth in recorded history to be discovered and colonised by humans, unsighted until 1820 when the Russian expedition of Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev on Vostok and Mirny sighted the Fimbul ice shelf. The continent, however, remained largely neglected {{for the rest of}} the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of easily accessible resources, and isolation. In 1895, the first confirmed landing was <b>conducted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> team of Norwegians.|$|E

As expected, there was no opposition to the landing on 4 November and work soon began on logistics facilities.|$|E
5|$|Follow-up {{observations}} were <b>conducted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> European and American science {{team at the}} 1.2m Leonhard Euler Telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile, which further {{raised the possibility of}} the existence of a planet in WASP-15's orbit; use of the CORALIE spectrograph on the Euler Telescope between March 6, 2008 and July 17, 2008 revealed that the variations in radial velocity measurements were not because of an eclipsing binary star system.|$|E
5|$|Follow-up {{observations}} were <b>conducted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> team of British, Spanish, French, Swiss and American astronomers using the photometer on the James Gregory Telescope in Scotland; using visual comparisons {{to the nearby}} bright star HD 80408, the star's light curve was better defined. In combination with measurements of WASP-13's spectrum measured using the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory in France, the star's radial velocity was also discovered. The Fibre-Fed Echelle Spectrograph on the Nordic Optical Telescope gathered additional measurements of WASP-13's spectrum, allowing astronomers to determine WASP-13's characteristics. Use of SOPHIE's data led {{to the discovery of}} the planet WASP-13b in 2008; the planet was reported in 2009.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to training courses available at a NOAC or section conclave, the OA offers specialized leadership training as weekend events for members: Lodge Leadership Development (LLD), National Leadership Seminars (NLS), and National Lodge Adviser Training Seminar (NLATS). LLD is a one-day or two-day event <b>conducted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> lodge to train their officers and advisers. NLS's are conducted by regions for lodge officers and advisers. Many lodges send key officers to receive training. Typically, each region schedules {{three or four}} NLS weekends annually, at geographically dispersed locations within the region. NLATS is a training event for adults, usually held in conjunction with an NLS and conducted by regions, {{on the role of}} advisers in the OA.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{the other}} majors, the tournament {{consists}} of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three {{for the first two}} rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament <b>conducted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.|$|E

Obama hosted and attended the Seder each year from 2009 to 2016. It was the first Passover Seder to be <b>conducted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> sitting U.S. president in the White House.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslav coup d'état {{occurred}} on 27 March 1941 in Belgrade, Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The coup was planned and <b>conducted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> group of pro-Western Serb-nationalist Royal Yugoslav Air Force officers formally led by its commander, General Dušan Simović, {{who had been}} associated {{with a number of}} coup plots from 1938 onwards. For practical purposes Brigadier General of Military Aviation Borivoje Mirković, Major Živan Knežević of the Yugoslav Royal Guards, and his brother Radoje Knežević all performed leadership roles in the conduct of the coup. In addition to Radoje Knežević, some other civilian leaders were probably aware of the coup before it was launched and moved to support it once it occurred, but they were not among the organisers.|$|E

A light novel titled Kakashi Hiden: Lightning in the Icy Sky, written by Akira Higashiyama and illustrated by Kishimoto, focuses on the early days of Kakashi's appointment as the Sixth Hokage, in which he has to stop a terror plan <b>conducted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> pair of Kirigakure ninja, who plan to take control of a newly unveiled airborne ship to stage a jailbreak of a notorious criminal, in the process learning about the pair's tragic reason for doing so.|$|E
5|$|Nonfatal {{health effects}} were {{difficult}} to measure in the smog's immediate aftermath. Some of the health effects were themselves delayed; for example, most of the serious effects on the elderly population would only manifest days after initial exposure. A study on the smog's nonfatal health effects was published in December 1966. The study, <b>conducted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> nonprofit health research group, found that 10 percent of the city's population suffered some negative health effects from the smog, including symptoms like stinging eyes, coughing, wheezing, the coughing-up of phlegm, or difficulty breathing. The director of the research group said anything serious enough to adversely affect as much as 10 percent of the population, like the smog had, indicated {{the existence of a}} serious public health problem.|$|E

5|$|On 1 May, {{the first}} mission was <b>conducted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> single Vulcan (XM607) that flew over Port Stanley and dropped its bombs on the {{airfield}} {{concentrating on the}} single runway, with one direct hit, making it unsuitable for fighter aircraft. The Vulcan's mission was quickly followed up by strikes against anti-air installations, flown by British Aerospace Sea Harriers from nearby Royal Navy carriers. Three Vulcan missions were flown against the airfield, a further two missions in which missiles were launched against radar installations; an additional two missions were cancelled. At the time, these missions held {{the record for the}} world's longest-distance raids. The ECM systems on board the Vulcans proved to be effective at jamming Argentine radars; while a Vulcan was within the theatre, other British aircraft in the vicinity had a greatly reduced chance of coming under effective fire.|$|E
5|$|On February 6, 2007, {{the day of}} the album's release, Fall Out Boy played three free shows, each in a {{different}} city in the United States. The day started with a morning performance in Times Square in New York City, followed by a gig in the band's hometown of Chicago, and then a late-night show in Los Angeles. In March 2008, Fall Out Boy attempted to enter The Guinness Book of World Records for being the only band to perform in all seven continents in nine months, planning to perform in Antarctica for an audience of scientists while working with Greenpeace to raise awareness about global warming. However, the group was unable to make the flight from Punta Arenas, Chile to Antarctica due to poor weather.

The game runs on the proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE), which was improved for the game to improve its draw distance rendering capabilities. The Euphoria and Bullet software handle additional animation and rendering tasks. Having exhausted the use of previous hardware on previous projects, Rockstar felt inspired after realising the potential power of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Analyst estimations place the game's combined development and marketing budget between US$80 million and US$100 million, {{which would make it}} one of the most expensive video games ever made.|$|E
