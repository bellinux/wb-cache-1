While the area previously has had some residential areas and has mostly been dominated by industry, {{it has now been}} designated a primary site for urban development in Oslo. The area has a potential for 25,000 residences and 2.5 million square meters (25millionsqft) of commercial area. Oslo Municipal Council approved in May 2013 the construction of 730 apartments in the immediate vicinity of the station. The zoning plan allow the line was passed on 14 December 2011. The winner of the 2012 architecture competition was MDH Arkitekter and Arne Henriksen. Their proposal was backed by structural engineers Aas-Jakobsen.

The lower parts of the Grorud Line was closed from September through December to allow construction work on the connection. The Ring Line from Sinsen to Carl Berners plass is similarly proposed closed from June 2014 to March 2015. Construction is scheduled for completion in October 2015 and to be opened in early 2016. Construction was carried out with two crossections, from Anders Winsvoldsvei and Båhusveien at Bilia.

2500|$|Because the {{divergence}} is {{inversely proportional}} to the spot size, for a given wavelength λ, a Gaussian beam that is focused to a small spot diverges rapidly as it propagates away from the focus. Conversely, to minimize the divergence of a laser beam in the far field (and increase its peak intensity at large distances) it must have a large <b>crossection</b> (w0) at the waist (and thus a large diameter where it is launched, since w(z) is never less than w0 [...] ). This relationship between beam width and divergence is a fundamental characteristic of diffraction, and of the Fourier transform which describes Fraunhofer diffraction. A beam with any specified amplitude profile also obeys this inverse relationship, but the fundamental Gaussian mode is a special case where the product of beam size at focus and far-field divergence is smaller than for any other case.|$|E

Both the amygdalofugal pathway and the stria terminalis project to the septal region, the hypothalamus, and the thalamus, but the stria terminalis reaches the septal region and the hypothalamus in a much longer and less direct path.
