The term distributed generation refers to the production of electricity near the consumption place. The distributed generation resources are renewable energies and <b>cogeneration</b> (simultaneous <b>production</b> of heat and electricity).

50|$|Various non-electric {{applications}} {{exist that}} have a large market demand for energy: steam reforming, paper and pulp production, chemicals and plastics, etc. Light water reactors are less suitable to most of these markets due to the low operating temperature of around 300 °C, and the large size of the reactors. The IMSR's smaller size and higher operating temperature (around 700 °C) could potentially open up new markets in these process heat applications. In addition, <b>cogeneration,</b> the <b>production</b> of both power and electricity, are also potentially attractive.|$|R

Cleanergy currently focuses on renewable, gaseous mixtures that are relatively difficult to burn since the energy content is small compared to natural gas, such as landfill gas. In the present study, the performances of such Stirling engine are evaluated, when the gas mixture fed to the engine itself and the operating conditions are changed.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the last}} {{years there has been}} a growing {{interest}} in the area of city infrastructures research, driven by the goal of reducing continuous energy usage without affecting standards of living. The more alternative energy sources and energy conversion technologies (such as solar, wind, hydroelectric power or fuel cells) are being utilized, the more dependent become utilities one from another and the more they interact and exchange resources. For instance, renewable energy is typically intermittent and it is often required to convert it into other utilities or store it for further use. Another example of interdependencies of utilities is <b>cogeneration</b> – <b>production</b> of several utilities from a single fuel. Therefore it is often necessary to maintain utility networks taking into account its interconnections with the other utility networks. In this paper we focus on the city infrastructure networks that supply buildings with utilities such as electricity or heating and consider them jointly for the analysis of interdependencies between them. A graph-based approach to represent utility networks and their interconnections is suggested. We propose different applications of a graph-theoretical model that captures not only topological structure of the city networks, but also its physical properties. Further, we propose that such graph models can be used not only in vulnerability analysis where similar graphs have been used until now, but also for other purposes, such as condition monitoring of the network or optimization control...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop an {{economic}} model {{that explains the}} decision-making problem under uncertainty of an industrial firm that wants {{to invest in a}} process technology. More specifically, the decision is between making an irreversible investment in a combined heat-and-power <b>production</b> (<b>cogeneration)</b> system, or to invest in a conventional heat-only generation system (steam boiler) and to purchase all electricity from the grid. In our model we include the main economic and technical variables of the investment decision process. We also account for the risk and uncertainty inherent in volatile energy prices that can greatly affect the valuation of the investment project. The dynamic stochastic model presented allows us to simultaneously determine the optimal technology choice and investment timing. We apply the theoretical model and illustrate our main findings with a numerical example that is based on realistic cost values for industrial oil- or gas-fired cogeneration and heat-only generation in Switzerland. We also briefly discuss expected effects of a CO 2 tax on the investment decision. Cogeneration, Irreversible investment, Risk, Uncertainty, Real options...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role that nuclear fission energy could play in assuring a {{reliable}} energy supply, in a sustainable development scenario with the aim to limit the global warming rise to + 2 °C. Reference to scenario "IPCC IS 92 a, Business as Usual" will be used and kept out {{with the history of}} the world primary energy consumption from 1970 to 2005. Besides, in the medium-long term, growing fission nuclear energy rates are hypothized from 29. 3 EJ (ExaJoule) in 2005 to about 400 - 500 EJ by the end of the century. This would entail generating about 80 % electricity by nuclear power sources. This aim is within reach of today's day nuclear technology and has already been attained in France. Technological innovation and the free markets are pushing us towards a global economy; in this context nuclear power could enlarge its range and be used for large powered ships, see water desalination, <b>cogeneration,</b> hydrogen <b>production,</b> electric rail roads and domestic use. On the basis of the scientific and technological know how one can evaluate energy supplies that, by the end of the century, could lead to the transition from thermal nuclear fission reactors to fast nuclear fission reactors. Such reactors allow a more efficient use of nuclear fuel of about 160 times more than thermal reactors, and the extractable energy from raw materials is 160 times higher. Parametric studies have allowed to evaluate uranium use both for thermal and fast reactors on the basis of the present inventory of uranium resources. Even if we were to imagine costs 10 times higher than today's price of the spot market, results show that the impact of nuclear fuel has been evaluated for final cost of electricity generation that is not 3 - 4 % higher than total cost...|$|R
40|$|Improving {{the energy}} {{economics}} of manufacturing {{is essential to}} revitalizing the industrial base of advanced economies. This paper evaluates a federal policy option aimed at promoting industrial <b>cogeneration</b> – the <b>production</b> of heat and electricity in a single energy-efficient process. Detailed analysis using the National Energy Modeling System and spreadsheet calculations suggest that industrial cogeneration could meet 18 % of U. S. electricity requirements by 2035, compared with its current 8. 9 % market share. Substituting less efficient utility-scale power plants with cogeneration systems would produce numerous economic and environmental benefits, but would also create an assortment of losers as well as winners. Multiple perspectives to benefit/cost analysis are therefore valuable. Our {{results indicate that the}} federal cogeneration policy would be highly favorable to manufacturers and the public sector, cutting energy bills, generating billions of dollars in electricity sales, making producers more competitive, and reducing pollution. Traditional utilities, on the other hand, would likely lose revenues. From a public policy perspective, deadweight losses would be introduced by market-distorting federal incentives (ranging annually from $ 30 to $ 150 million), but these losses are much smaller than the estimated net social benefits of the federal cogeneration policy...|$|R
40|$|Optimization methodologies for {{national}} small-scale CHP strategies (the case of Lithuania) In general, implementation of {{combined heat and power}} production (CHP) {{has the potential}} of reducing fuel consumption by 30 percent. Small-scale CHP offers an additional possibility of expanding the potential by including minor towns and villages and helps replacing fossil fuels by local biomass resources. This paper compares some optimisation methodologies for identification of small-scale CHP implementation strategies. The paper is based on a study of Lithuania who is facing the need of huge investments in both the replacement of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant and of district heat production units in many of the existing systems. The importance of calculating business economic optimal solutions for small DH companies is em-phasised, and attention is focused on understanding the potential differences between business and socio-economic optimal solutions in the present situation of no CO 2 emission costs and possibilities of cheap import of Russian natural gas. Lithuania has a great potential of socio-eco-nomic benefits from the implementation of small-scale CHP. Meanwhile, such implementation needs public regulation to become feasible not only from the socio-economic but also from the business economic point of view.

40|$|Traditionally, only {{space heating}} and {{transportation}} have consumed more fuel than industrial process steam generation. Several {{recent studies have}} examined electricity and industrial steam supply and have recommended vigorous federal efforts to increase the <b>cogeneration,</b> or joint <b>production,</b> of electricity and process steam. The conceptual approach and analytic methods employed in these studies contain flaws that make them incomplete. The studies' recommendations are premised upon the existence of distortions in the markets surrounding cogeneration, but they offer only anecdotal evidence of such market failures. They propose increased cogeneration, citing aggregate energy savings for a single year and cumulative capital savings, but the analytic techniques they use in simulating market behavior and evaluating the desirability of various levels of cogeneration lack needed sophistication. This research addresses several of the methodological objections to the earlier studies. To unite this effort, the report poses two focal questions on cogeneration policy and economics: * Can the historical decline in cogeneration's importance be explained by changes in fuel prices and technologies alone? * What is the best future role for cogeneration if the choice is based on economic efficiency? First, the markets associated with cogeneration are examined from a qualitative perspective, employing the classic basic conditions/market structure/conduct/performance approach of industrial economics to explore the potential for inefficient market performance. Engineering production and cost functions are developed for a simple cogeneration plant design, offering insights into the economies of scale and joint production problems involved in the choice between <b>cogeneration</b> and separated <b>production</b> alternatives. Second, a multi-period linear programming model, called the Joint Generation Supply Model or JGSM, is form- ulated to simulate competitive market behavior in the aggregate U,S. electricity and process steam supply markets throughout a given time interval. JGSM is used to study the historical performance of these markets for 1960 to 1972 and the future role o cogeneration for 1975 to 2000, Appendices survey cogeneration technologies and the issues in integrating cogeneration plants into the utility system. The modeling of the historical question shows the decline {{can be explained by}} changes in cost conditions, but these results are very sensitive to the engineering cost assumptions. Analysis of cogeneration's future role indicates cogeneration should increase from its 4. 5 % share of electricity supply in 1975 to 9 % in 1985; it should also serve more than half the process steam supply. If cogeneration remains at its 1975 share through 2000, the additional costs imposed are worth about $ 10 billion in discounted capital and operating expenses. Too much cogeneration can hurt as much as too little: forcing it up to a 20 % share by 1985 imposes similar costs. For comparison of these losses to another issue, JGSM calculated that failure to develop low-Btu coalgasifying combined cycle power technologies results in losses worth $ 4 billion.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{priorities}} among European Union member states is to promote renewable energy. Latvia also has {{to comply with the}} European Parliament and Council Directive 2009 / 28 /EC on the promotion of renewable energy initiated on 23 April 2009. The directive states that renewable energy must reach 40 % of total final energy consumption by 2020. A portion of this can be achieved with the energy produced by burning biogas produced by the anaerobic digestion of biowaste. The use of biowaste as a resource allows Latvia to move closer to the EU’s common objectives by reducing the amount of waste disposed in landfills. Biogas production through anaerobic digestion {{is considered one of the}} most successful methods of dealing with increasing environmental pollution. Heat and electricity are produced by burning biogas in <b>cogeneration</b> plants. The <b>production</b> of biogas from organic waste also addresses issues related to the disposal of waste products. Waste that would otherwise be considered unusable has now found a second life in the production process of biogas. Given that until 2020, the share of renewable energy in Latvia has to be increased, it can be expected that in the coming years the amount of biogas production and combustion plants will increase. Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is a well-known tool which can aid in sustainable development. Screening is one of the most important stages of EIA. The paper analyses the possibilities of developing a screening process for anaerobic digestion of biowaste projects for EIA in Latvia. In this paper, the demands which should be included in the guidelines of the screening process were created and analysed...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{substantial}} interest within the Australian sugar industry in product diversification {{as a means}} to reduce its exposure to fluctuating raw sugar prices and in order to increase its commercial viability. In particular, the industry is looking at fibrous residues from sugarcane harvesting (trash) and from sugarcane milling (bagasse) for <b>cogeneration</b> and the <b>production</b> of biocommodities, as these are complementary to the core process of sugar production. A means of producing surplus residue (biomass) is to process whole sugarcane crop. In this paper, the composition of different juices derived from different harvesting methods, viz. burnt cane with all trash extracted (BE), green cane with half of the trash extracted (GE), and green cane (whole sugarcane crop) with trash unextracted (GU), were investigated and the results and comparison presented. The determination of electrical conductivity, inorganic composition, and organic acids indicate that both GU and GE cane juice contain a higher proportion of soluble inorganic ions and ionisable organic acids, compared to BE cane juice. It {{is important to note that}} there are considerably higher levels of Na ions and citric acid, but relatively low P levels in the GU samples. A higher level of reducing sugars was analysed in the GU samples than the BE samples due to the higher proportion of impurities found naturally in sugarcane tops and leaves. The purity of the first expressed juice (FEJ) of GU cane was on average higher than that of FEJ of BE cane. Results also show that GU juices appear to contain higher levels of proteins and polysaccharides, with no significant difference in starch levels...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{cogeneration}} {{system provides}} electrical (or mechanical) and useful thermal energ y {{from the same}} primary energ y source. When comparing efficiencies between <b>cogeneration</b> and separate <b>production</b> of electricity and heat, it appears that cogeneration allows considerable savings in fuel consumption. But, beside these important environmental issues, economical viability of a cogeneration project is still challenging for operators. Economical viability relies on many factors, among which how to operate each unit. In this study, we shall focus on the heat-match mode where the operator’s priority is to satisfy the local heat consumer demands. When these demands are satisfied (possibly by means of auxiliary boilers), the amount of excess electricity is exported to the grid, while the lack of electricity is bought from an electricity market. In this framework, we will consider both the question of optimal operation and optimal sizing {{for a set of}} cogenerations. First we shall consider an operator who operates over a given designed (technolog y, size, location) set of cogeneration units. The best operating mode minimizing the convex but non differential cost of operation for the overall set of cogeneration units is achieved through an optimization procedure. The optimum relies on the ordered sequence of marginal costs associated with the different operational modes for each unit. This merit order indicates that the optimal operation of the cogeneration power plant is achieved through an economic dispatch mode. Based on this merit order result, an optimal sizing method is addressed so as to minimize the total cost of the plants’ operational strateg y. The sizing problem is formulated in order to decide the nominal electrical power of the cogenerations. We can show that this formulation still leads to a convex problem...|$|R
