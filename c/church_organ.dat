In 1645 Sir Thomas Fairfax led the New Model Army through the town {{on the way to}} capturing Bristol, and in 1646 the <b>church</b> <b>organ</b> was apparently destroyed by Cromwellian soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Not {{far from}} Copenhagen Airport on the Kastrup coast, The Blue Planet {{completed}} in March 2013 now houses the national aquarium. With its 53 aquariums, {{it is the}} largest facility of its kind in Scandinavia. Grundtvig's Church, located in the northern suburb of Bispebjerg, was designed by P.V. Jensen Klint and completed in 1940. A rare example of Expressionist church architecture, its striking west façade is reminiscent of a <b>church</b> <b>organ.</b>|$|E
5|$|Church {{belief in}} {{the resurrection of the}} body led to a {{prohibition}} against cremation that was pastorally modified at the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s under limited circumstances, but those conditions have been largely ignored even by the clergy. According to the Catechism, burial of the dead is a corporal work of mercy that must treat the body with respect and love (e.g. scattering of cremated remains, burial in an unmarked grave, etc. are forbidden in the Catholic <b>Church).</b> <b>Organ</b> donation after death and organ transplants under certain terms, also autopsies for legal and scientific reasons are permitted.|$|E

25|$|These {{were the}} major {{builders}} of theatre organs, listed {{in order of}} production. The numbers listed here are for theatre organs only, and do not include any classical organs {{that may have been}} produced. Many builders of <b>church</b> <b>organs</b> also made theatre organs in very small numbers, such as Casavant, which only made seven theatre organs, but thousands of <b>church</b> <b>organs.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Morricone {{and three other}} Italian composers (Piero Piccioni, Armando Trovajoli and Luis Bacalov) founded Forum Music Village (Rome), {{previously}} called Ortophonic recording studio. The recording studio has some peculiarities, {{one of them is}} the ability to record a <b>church</b> <b>organ</b> directly to the studio.|$|E
25|$|A whistle is an {{instrument}} which produces sound from {{a stream of}} gas, most commonly air. It may be mouth-operated, or powered by air pressure, steam, or other means. Whistles vary in size from a small slide whistle or nose flute type to a large multi-piped <b>church</b> <b>organ.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>church</b> <b>organ</b> is {{situated}} {{in one of the}} arches pierced into the north wall. It is a small two-manual pipe organ by Rushworth and Dreaper, from 1925, which was originally in Wesley Hall, Westcliff-on-Sea. It was installed in St Laurence by Martin Cross in 1976 who restored it in 2004.|$|E
25|$|After {{the advent}} of {{unification}} and the electro-pneumatic action, builders of <b>church</b> <b>organs</b> started to see the advantages of these systems. As a result, several organ builders began adopting these concepts for use in their <b>church</b> <b>organs.</b> Among these were Austin, Möller, Aeolian-Skinner and Kimball, who used electro-pneumatic action in many of their organs. Today, approximately one fourth of all new or rebuilt <b>church</b> pipe <b>organs</b> use an electro-pneumatic action either exclusively, or as an augmentation to existing tracker actions. In the same vein, some amount of unification was utilized in some <b>church</b> <b>organs,</b> and even today many <b>church</b> pipe <b>organs</b> utilize some degree of unification in areas where it is not critical to the classical sound sought in such instruments, or in instruments where space for pipes is limited. With stops such as the 32' bourdon in the pedal division, or a 16' reed in a manual division, the basic theatre organ concept of extension is commonly—but discreetly—used by even the most noted organ builders.|$|R

25|$|Hungarian bagpiping is {{characterized}} in its styling by hiccupping, use of high notes to articulate lower notes, creating a characteristic rhythmic squeaking while the instrument is played. This playing style greatly influenced certain genres of fiddle music in Hungary, and also characterized early <b>church</b> <b>organ</b> music in Hungary: {{prior to the}} introduction of organs, the duda had been used to accompany hymnody in churches.|$|E
25|$|Prior to demolishment, the <b>church</b> <b>organ</b> {{was moved}} to the former chapel of the St. Catharina Gasthuis, which had become a second Walloon Church {{at a time when the}} Vrouwekerk had become too small to {{accommodate}} the entire parish community. A number of tombstones were moved to the Pieterskerk church. Some of these were returned to their original location in the Vrouwekerk in 1989.|$|E

25|$|These ranks are voiced in {{relation}} to other pipe ranks in the organ, allowing a handful of ranks in a typical theatre organ to imitate a wide range of instruments. Unification also makes it possible to play any rank of pipes from any manual and the pedals independently, unlike a traditional <b>church</b> <b>organ,</b> where a rank of pipes is playable only from one manual or the pedals, unless couplers are employed.|$|E

25|$|St Bartholomews's parish {{register}} {{dates from}} 1569. The {{south side of}} the church nave was rebuilt in about 1400. In 1873, the north aisle was extended and the chancel rebuilt by J. H.

In 1887 a carved oak Gothic reredos was installed.|$|E
25|$|The choir loft is at {{the west}} end of the church. It was largely rebuilt in the 1980s after a fire in 1985. The <b>church</b> <b>organ</b> is in the choir loft.

At the back of the choir loft there is a large modern stained glass rose window in plate tracery style that depicts the descent of the Holy Spirit, which was {{completed}} by the Ipswich artist Danielle Hopkinson for the Millennium.|$|E
25|$|At {{the west}} of the nave within the tower arch is the 1780 <b>church</b> <b>organ</b> with part of a 15th-century three-panelled screen set in front as part of the organist’s chairthis screen may have come from {{neighbouring}} Berden Hall. Within the nave against the north wall of the chancel arch is an octagonal oak pulpit with ornamented panelling taken from an earlier 17th-century pulpit. Behind the pulpit on the chancel arch west face is inscribed, in Lomardic capitals, a mason inscription: “Gefrai Limathun” (Geoffrey the Mason). The church octagonal font sits at {{the west of}} the nave central to the tower arch, and is plain and painted white, with a plain octagonal wood cover on which sits a floral display.|$|E
