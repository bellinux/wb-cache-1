40|$|Financial {{intermediaries}} perform indirect financing, {{and in this}} context, {{commercial banks}} are very important participants. They carry out the bulk of indirect financing transactions. On the other hand, the implementation mechanism of monetary policy is {{closely linked to the}} functioning of the banking system. Kosovo’s Commercial Banks performance is satisfactory compared with regional. In this paper we provide some of the performance indicators. The rates of return of commercial banks are greatly and directly affected by the net interest margin, provisions for loan losses, revenues and expenses by the non-interest, taxes and the equity multiplier. In this context, liquid assets {{do not appear to be}} of high impact in determining and variability the rate of return, high liquidity with low returns. Also, we address the impact of the global financial crisis “ 2008 - 20012 ” in the commercial banks performance in Kosovo, mainly through the impact of the decline in the asset use ratio. We think that was a positive approach that banks have followed the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>returns</b> fall by the reduction in interest-expenditures, while the costs of provisions for loan losses to total average assets marked constant level throughout the period, despite the increasing ratio of nonperforming loans. Drawing on these findings it is recommended that banks even further engage in reducing operational costs; diversify income sources in order not to rely exclusively on the interests of loans, and to strengthen credit risk management in order to minimize the credit risk. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The time <b>course</b> <b>of</b> carbachol-induced {{desensitization}} onset {{and recovery}} of sensitivity after desensitization have been compared at the frog neuromuscular junction. The activation-desensitization sequence was determined from input conductance measurements using potassium-depolarized muscle preparations. Both desensitization onset and recovery from desensitization could be adequately described by single time constant expressions, with Tonset being considerably shorter than ~'~overy. In nine experiments, ronset was 13 [...] + 1. 3 s and r~overy was 424 -+ 51 s with 1 mM carbachol. Elevating the external calcium or carbachol concentration accelerated desensitization onset without changing {{the recovery of}} sensitivity after equilibrium desensitization. Desensitization onset was accelerated by a prior activation-desensitization sequence to an extent determined by the recovery interval that followed the initial carbachol application. The time <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> ~' 0 n~t was closely parallel to, but slower than the time <b>course</b> <b>of</b> recovery of sensitivity. These {{results are consistent with}} a cyclic model in which intracellular calcium is a factor controlling the rate of development of desensitization...|$|R

Within the first day postflight, the magnitude of response to an applied translation was on average three times greater than for controls. The reduced gravitational acceleration in orbit apparently resulted in an upregulation of the sensitivity of utricular afferents. By 30 h postflight, responses were statistically similar to control.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the dynamic {{properties of the}} human vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) during roll head rotations in three human subjects using the magnetic search coil technique. In {{the first of two}} experiments, we quantify the behavior of the ocular motor plant in the torsional plane. The subject's eye was mechanically displaced into intorsion, extorsion or abduction, and the dynamic <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> the eye to its resting position was measured. The mean predominant time constants <b>of</b> <b>return</b> were 210 msec from intorsion, 83 msec from extorsion, and 217 msec from abduction, although there was considerable variability of results from different trials and subjects. In the second experiment, we quantify the efficacy of velocity-to-position integration of the vestibular signal. Position-step stimuli were used to test the torsional or horizontal VOR, being applied with subjects heads erect or supine. After a torsional position-step, the eye drifted back to its resting position, but after a horizontal position-step the eye held its new horizontal position. To interpret these responses we used a simple model of the VOR with parameters of the ocular motor plant set to values determined during Exp 1. The time constant of the velocity-to-position neural integrator was smaller (typically 2 sec) in the torsional plane than in the horizontal plane (> 20 sec). No disconjugacy of torsional eye movements was observed. Thus, the dynamic properties of the VOR in roll differ significantly from those of the VOR in yaw, reflecting different visual demands placed on this reflex in these two planes...|$|R

A retrospective chart review of adults admitted to a quaternary hospital {{for the treatment of}} an acute chemical ingestion injury between 2008 and 2012 was conducted. Forty-four adults (23 men, 21 women) were identified as receiving treatment for ingestion injury, of whom 18 (40. 91 %) required altered oral intake. Of those requiring altered oral intake, 50 % were referred to SLPs. Individuals requiring altered oral intake were significantly (p <. 05) older, more likely to be men, and present with more severe injuries requiring longer ICU and hospital admissions following intentional chemical ingestions than those who were able to commence a normal oral diet without any alteration or nonoral supplementation. By discharge, 15. 91 % (n = 7) of the total cohort had not resumed normal oral intake. Return to oral intake post chemical ingestion injury can be protracted and complex. Referrals to SLPs were limited. These data may aid prognostic insight as well as provide (a) collateral information to assist discharge planning and follow-up and (b) background for evaluating the potential for SLP involvement...|$|R

During the second phase, behavioral contrast effects were evident. Investing in the market that ceased to yield returns dropped precipitously, and investing in the unchanged market increased significantly. Although the behavior may be economically “irrational,” it is predictable from the matching law and shows that interactions among a history <b>of</b> intermittent <b>returns</b> in a <b>course</b> <b>of</b> action, current <b>return</b> rate, and currently available alternative <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> action are important determinants of persisting in, or withdrawing from, a failing <b>course</b> <b>of</b> action...|$|R
