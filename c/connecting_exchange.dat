40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a range of topics which <b>connect</b> <b>exchange</b> rates to the economic growth process. In particular, we first of all outline the basic properties of exchange rates when they are flexible. One key feature of flexible exchange rates {{is that they are}} highly volatile and such volatility may affect growth through the channels of trade and investment. These channels are considered in some detail in this paper. We also consider the links between sectoral and aggregate growth and the exchange rate, using the Balassa-Samuelson and Houthakker-Magee-Krugman hypotheses. The main conclusion of the paper is that the current exchange rate arrangements for the euro-zone area, both internal and external, are likely to stimulate economic growth. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Recent large {{deployment}} of high-speed metro Ethernet networks creates opportunity to <b>connect</b> legacy telephone <b>exchange</b> centers and cellular telephone base stations {{to the core}} telephony network. The success of data and legacy voice services convergence shall depend on whether it can provide the customer with the required QoS or not. Packet-base telephony service requires stringent bounds on end-to-end packet delay, jitter, and loss. New protocols such as MPLS and Diffserv are realized due to the major advantages associated with them such as QoS. This paper studies the performance of <b>connecting</b> telephone <b>exchange</b> centers over a metro Ethernet network using MPLS and DiffServ QoS model. We will implement some simulations to evaluate the performance in terms of delay, jitter and loss...|$|R
