40|$|This study {{presents}} a comprehensive periodic slab DFT investigation into structures, electronic properties and thermodynamic stability of all plausible terminations of CuBr and CuBr 2 surfaces. We first estimate lattice constants, formation and cohesive energies {{for the two}} bulk <b>copper</b> <b>bromides</b> before proceeding to analyse geometrical and electronic features of CuBr and CuBr 2 configurations. Surface geometries exhibit, to a large extent, corresponding bulk structures. Nevertheless, certain CuBr 2 surfaces experience a downward displacement of the topmost Cu-containing layers. We plot total and projected density of states for bulk and surface geometries of these two <b>copper</b> <b>bromides</b> and calculate their associated Bader's electronic charges. Electronic structure analysis for the bulk and surfaces of these two <b>copper</b> <b>bromides</b> show that CuBr bulk and its most stable surface (CuBr(001) _Br) do not exhibit any metallic character, whereas CuBr 2 bulk and its most stable surface (CuBr 2 (001) _Br) both exhibit metallic characters. The formalism of the ab initio atomistic thermodynamics affords the construction of energy phase diagrams. We predict that the CuBr(001) surface, truncated with Br atoms, is the most stable structure among the considered CuBr slabs at all physically meaningful ranges of the chemical potential of bromine. This surface resembles a c(2 × 2) -bromine sheet that was characterised experimentally from initial interaction of Br 2 with a Cu(100) surface. We find that surfaces terminated with the electronegative bromine atoms, if accompanied by significant relaxation, {{tend to be more}} stable. Calculated surface energies predict the shapes of CuBr and CuBr 2 nanoparticles as the chemical potential of bromine changes...|$|R

50|$|Lasers using pure metal vapor {{produced}} from an elemental copper source {{are difficult to}} construct because of the extremely high temperature, about 1500 degrees C, necessary to create such vapor, severely limiting the materials for the vapor containment vessel and mirrors. Copper halides, specifically copper chloride, <b>copper</b> <b>bromide</b> and copper iodide, have been substituted since they form vapors at much lower temperatures, in the range 300-600 degrees C, but operation at such temperatures remains difficult. Copper compound vapors also increase {{the complexity of the}} pump signal applied to the device. Typically, two energizing pulses in quick succession are required, the first to dissociate vapor molecules, and the second to cause the dissociated ions to lase. Operating temperature can be further reduced by the use of copper nitrate or copper acetylacetonate, whose vapors give peak laser output power at 180 and 40 degrees C, respectively.|$|E

This paper describes synthesis and structural characterization of 2 -methyl- 3 - triazolyl chromanone oxime ethers as potential antifungal agent. Materials and Methods: Bromination of 2 -hydroxyacetophenones with <b>copper</b> (II) <b>bromide</b> followed by reaction with 1, 2, 4 -triazole gave the corresponding α-triazolyl- 2 -hydroxyacetophenones, which separated as regioisomers.

40|$|Opportunities {{exist for}} {{effective}} coal combustion additives that {{can reduce the}} carbon content of pulverised fuel ash to below 6 %, thereby improving the efficiency of low NOx burners and making the ash saleable for filler/building material applications. However, catalytic performance under pulverised fuel boiler conditions has received relatively little consideration. For the first time, the research set out in this thesis systematically compares the reactivity of catalysed and uncatalysed bituminous coal samples during combustion in a drop tube furnace (DTF) and a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA). All of the inorganic compounds investigated were accordingly found to increase the rate of TGA char oxidation, with certain transition metal halides proving to be extremely successful additives. But these trends did not always translate into analogous carbon burnout improvements on th~ medium-scale DTF. This {{was due to the}} inherent variability associated with this experimental setup, the use of physical mixtures for catalyst dispersion and the intrinsic volatility of some of the tested salts. Furthermore several very effective additives on the TGA, the copper halides, seemingly deactivated under the conditions experienced in the DTF, reducing the attained carbon burnouts to levels below those observed with the uncatalysed coal fractions. Complex interactions were subsequently discovered between <b>copper</b> (I) <b>bromide</b> and the coal's mineral matter, implying that a copper-iron association could have been behind this behaviour. In contrast, the thermally labile iron halides were found to be exceptional additives for enhancing DTF carbon burnout, even at temperatures above their predicted boiling points in what could have previously been assumed to be a completely mass transfer controlled reaction regime. The combustion improvements associated with the introduction of iron (Ill) bromide were thus rigorously established and then related to the retention of the additive's cation, as indicated by SEM/EDX and ICP-MS.
