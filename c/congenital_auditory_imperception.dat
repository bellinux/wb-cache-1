40|$|The article {{describes}} the theoretical basis and practical recommendations for modelling the facilitative educational environment for elementary school pupils with learning difficulties. It is shown that 80 % of elementary school pupils with learning difficulties have problems related to <b>auditory</b> <b>imperceptions.</b> At the same time, the peripheral hearing of these students is usually normal.  Auditory imperception has {{a negative impact on}} all types of educational activities, as educational material is mainly based on aural reception. The practical recommendations are aimed at changing the objective environment and the communicative strategies of all adults involved in educational activities of pupils in order to create conditions facilitating the aural reception of information by pupils. To create a facilitative environment, the following measures are proposed: improvement of the acoustic characteristics of the learning premises, the use of visual cues, change of the communicative strategies of adults, the use of special equipment in the classroom. The author suggests measures for creating the facilitating environment at home for children with aural imperceptions when they do their homework. </p...|$|R

40|$|There is much anecdotal {{suggestion}} of improved visual skills in congenitally deaf individuals. However, this claim {{has only been}} met by mixed results from careful investigations of visual skills in deaf individuals. Psychophysical assessments of visual functions have failed, for the most part, to validate the view of enhanced visual skills after deafness. Only {{a few studies have}} shown an advantage for deaf individuals in visual tasks. Interestingly, all of these studies share the requirement that participants process visual information in their peripheral visual field under demanding conditions of attention. This work has led us to propose that <b>congenital</b> <b>auditory</b> deprivation alters the gradient of visual attention from central to peripheral field by enhancing peripheral processing. This hypothesis was tested by adapting a search task from Lavie and colleagues in which the interference from distracting information on the search task provides a measure of attentiona...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe used Goldmann kinetic perimetry {{to compare}} how {{training}} and <b>congenital</b> <b>auditory</b> deprivation {{may affect the}} size of the visual field. We measured the ability of action video game players and deaf observers to detect small moving lights at various locations in the central (around 30 degrees from fixation) and peripheral (around 60 degrees) visual fields. Experiment 1 found that 10 habitual video game players showed significantly larger central and peripheral field areas than 10 controls. In Experiment 2 we found that 13 congenitally deaf observers had significantly larger visual fields than 13 hearing controls for both the peripheral and central fields. Here the greatest differences were found in the lower parts of the fields. Comparison of the two groups showed that whereas VGP players have a more uniform increase in field size in both central and peripheral fields deaf observers show non-uniform increases with greatest increases in lower parts of the visual field...|$|R
40|$|Objective: <b>Congenital</b> <b>auditory</b> {{neuropathy}} (AN) affects {{hearing and}} speech development. The degree of hearing difficulty in congenital AN varies {{as a function}} of pathology at the inner ear hair cell (IHC) synapses or the auditory nerve. We report a case of a Chinese girl with AN revealed by OTOF (otoferlin) gene mutation analysis who had only a mild hearing loss. Patient: A 13 -year-old Chinese girl was diagnosed as having congenital AN on the basis of OTOF gene mutation analysis. She manifest a mild sensorineural hearing loss with 50 % maximum monosyllable speech discrimination rate, normal DPOAEs (distortion product otoacoustic emissions) beyond ambient noise levels, only SPs (summating potentials) evoked during ECoG (electrocochleography) and absent ABRs (auditory evoked brainstem responses) bilaterally to clicks presented at 100  dBnHL. She was able to effectively communicate with others by speech reading owing to her mild hearing loss. Moreover, bilateral hearing aids helped her to communicate. Conclusions: Our patient was demonstrated to have a mutation on the OTOF gene. Nevertheless, she was able to communicate using auditory visual speech reading in spite of a mild auditory threshold elevation probably due to partial pathology at the IHC synapses or in the auditory nerve...|$|R
40|$|Congenital amusia is {{a lifelong}} {{disorder}} affecting the processing of pitch. This pitch deficit canbe traceddown toabnormal brain responses elicitedbypitch changes smaller than a semitone in conditions requiring attention. Here, we use the mismatch negativ-ity (MMN) to investigate pre-attentive pitch change detection in 10 amusics and eight matched controls. Results indicate similar MMN in amusics and controls, even for an eighth of a tone change, revealing that the amusic brain can process small pitch changes at a pre-attentive level. Thus, the pitch deficit in congenital amusia {{may be related to}} a problem of perceptual awareness. Key words: <b>congenital</b> amusia; <b>auditory</b> ERP; mismatch negativity; pitch change detectio...|$|R

Acquired patterns of selective loss and sparing are described, including both the association and dissociation of music and text reading, and association and dissociation among components of music reading. As well, we suggest that developmental music - reading deficiencies may be isolated in a form analogous to developmental dyslexia for text or <b>congenital</b> amusia for <b>auditory</b> music processing. Finally, we propose {{that the results of}} brain damage studies can {{contribute to the development of}} a model of normal music reading...|$|R
40|$|The main {{function}} of a hearing aid is to improve auditory and language abilities of hearing impaired users. The amplification model has to be adapted according to age, degree and type of hearing loss. The goal {{of this paper is}} to analyze the current amplification models of sensorineural and conductive hearing loss which can provide a high quality of speech perception and sounds at any degree of hearing loss. The BAHA is a surgically implantable system for treatment of conductive hearing loss that works through direct bone conduction. BAHA is used to help people with chronic ear infections, <b>congenital</b> external <b>auditory</b> canal atresia and single sided deafness who cannot benefit from conventional hearing aids. The last generation of hearing aid for sensorineural hearing loss is cochlear implant. Bimodal amplification improves binaural hearing. Hearing aids alone do not make listening easier in all situations. The things that can interfere with listening are background noises, distance from a sound and reverberation or echo. The device used most often today is the Frequency Modulated (FM) system...|$|R
40|$|A {{random sample}} was {{organized}} with 42 children with <b>congenital</b> sensorineural <b>auditory</b> deficit (severe and bilateral) from special education schools in Campinas. Chronological {{ages ranged from}} 4 to 7 years of age. This sample was compared with two control groups of 42 children of the same chronological age but attending normal classes. All were submitted to 9 tests of the set of static equilibrium of the Evolutive Neurologic Examination. It was observed that {{in the position of}} equilibrium with opened eyes (test 8) there were no differences between the groups. In the Romberg position, the hearing impaired children of 4, 5 and 6 years of age showed a significant decrease in the ability to do the test (test 9); those of 7 years of age had equal ability whether of the control or the deficient groups. Hearing impaired children were less able to do other static equilibrium tests (heel-toe or one foot or tip-toe standing tests, with opened or closed eyes: tests 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 25 and 26). The use of detailed neurological semiology allowed us to support the alteration of the static equilibrium in this group of hearing impaired children...|$|R
40|$|O Teste de Nomeação de Figuras por Escolha (TNF 2. 1 -Escolha) avalia a habilidade de escolher palavras escritas para nomear figuras, e analisa processos quirêmicos, ortográficos e semânticos envolvidos. Foi aplicado a 313 surdos de 6 - 34 anos, de 1 ª. série do Ensino Fundamental a 1 ª. do Médio de quatro escolas bilíngües paulistas (dos quais 77 % com perda congênita, e 49 %, congênita-profunda), junto com TNF 1. 1 -Escolha, e testes de vocabulário receptivo de sinais (TVRSL), competência de leitura de palavras (TCLPP), compreensão de leitura de sentenças (TCLS), nomeação de figuras por escrita (TNF-Escrita), e de sinais por escolha e escrita (TNS-Escolha e TNS-Escrita). Foi gerada tabela normativa de nomeação por série escolar. O TNF 2. 1 -Escolha manteve as seguintes inter-relações positivas significativas: correlação muito alta (r = 0, 89) com TNF 1. 1 -Escolha; alta (r = 0, 77 - 0, 80) com escrita do nome de figuras (TNF-Escrita) e leitura de sentenças (TCLS), média (r = 0, 62 - 0, 68) com nomeação de sinais por escolha e escrita (TNS-Escolha, TNS-Escrita) e competência de leitura (TCLPP); e baixa (r = 0, 36) com vocabulário de sinais (TVRSL). De 1. 507 paralexias, houve 583 ortográficas, 546 semânticas e 378 quirêmicas. Estas revelam que, ao escolher palavras para nomear figuras, surdos primeiro evocam o sinal da figura e, depois, a palavra do sinal, corroborando a hipótese de que o léxico quirêmico indexa o ortográfico ao pictorial. Corroborando a validade do TNF 2. 1 -Escolha em induzir paralexias, quanto maior a competência de leitura no TCLPP, menos paralexias ortográficas no TNF-Escolha, e quanto maior o vocabulário de sinais no TVRSL, menos paralexias quirêmicas no TNF 2. 1 -Escolha. The Picture-Print Matching Test (PPMT 2. 1) {{assesses the}} ability of naming {{pictures}} by choosing from among written words, and analyzes the cheremic, semantic and orthographic processes involved. The participants were 313 1 st- 9 th grade deaf students, aged 6 - 34 years, from São Paulo bilingual schools, of which 77 % had <b>congenital</b> <b>auditory</b> loss, and 49 %, profound congenital loss. Students {{were exposed to the}} following tests: PPMT 1. 1 and 2. 1, Receptive Vocabulary Test in Libras (RVTL), Word Reading Competence Test (WRCT), Sentence Reading Test (SRT), Picture Naming by Writing Test (PNWT), Sign Naming by Writing Test (SNWT), and Sign-Print Matching Test (SPMT). A standardization table was generated as a function of grade level PPMT 2. 1 presented the following significant positive correlations: very high (r = 0, 89) with PPMT 1. 1; high (r = 0, 77 - 0, 80) with Picture Naming by Writing (PNWT) and Sentence Reading (SRT); medium (r = 0, 62 - 0, 68) with Sign Naming by Writing and Matching (SNWT and SPMT) and Word Reading Competence (WRCT), and low (r = 0, 36) with Libras Receptive Vocabulary (RVTL). Out of 1. 507 paralexias, 583 were orthographic, 546 were semantic, and 378 were cheremic. The latter revealed that, when matching print to pictures, deaf students first evoke signs to pictures and subsequently words to signs. This corroborates the hypothesis that cheremic lexicon links orthographic and pictorial lexicons. As to paralexias in Picture-Print Matching Test (PPMT 2. 1), orthographic paralexias were inversely proportional to reading competence (WRCT scores), whereas cheremic paralexias were inversely proportional to Libras Receptive Vocabulary (RVTL scores), which corroborates the validity of PPMT 2. 1 in inducing orthographic paralexias and cheremic paralexias...|$|R
40|$|Maintenance of ear {{projection}} {{and post}} auricular sulcus in staged ear reconstruction in microtia is a trying problem. So {{also is the}} maintenance of the patency of the external auditory meatus following recanalization and meatoplasty. Numerous splints and dressing techniques have been described for the above situations. Some of the problems encountered include the availability of the materials, cost, expertise in fabrication and compliance. Aims: To devise a simple, reliable, inexpensive and readily available splint for the maintenance of post auricular sulcus and external auditory meatus opening. Settings and Design: A silicone catheter is made out of a soft and inert material that doesn&#x 2032;t cause tissue necrosis or any loss of skin graft. The basic design is that of a simple, self-retaining type of splint that doesn&#x 2032;t dislodge and can be prepared within minutes on the operating table. Materials and Methods: This splint has been used in four cases of microtia reconstruction and one case of <b>congenital</b> external <b>auditory</b> meatus stenosis between June 2006 and August 2007. A 14 or 16 Fr silicone Foley&#x 2032;s catheter was used. The proximal end of a catheter of required length was retained and the distal part was cut off. The catheter was looped into a circle {{around the base of the}} reconstructed ear and secured in position with a suture. A similar construct was used in cases of external auditory meatus reconstruction or recanalization. The funnel-shaped distal drainage end was sutured to the circular frame near the region of the tragus. This funnel was inserted into the external auditory canal. Results: The catheter was found to sit snugly in the newly created sulcus, thereby maintaining the sulcus and ear projection. It aided in maintaining the meatal opening of a satisfactory diameter in the case of external auditory canal recanalization. It was never found to slip or get dislodged in any of the cases. There was no skin graft loss or tissue necrosis due to the use of the splint. Conclusions: The silicone Foley&#x 2032;s catheter is found to be a simple, readily available, inexpensive and reliable self-retaining splint following ear elevation in microtia and external auditory meatus recanalization. The catheter is easily constructed and applied intraoperatively. The results following its usage have been uniformly good in all cases without causing any adverse events at the operated site or discomfort to the patient ensuring good compliance...|$|R
