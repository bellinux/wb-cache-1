5|$|Anatomically, {{the human}} {{cerebellum}} has {{the appearance of}} a separate structure attached {{to the bottom of the}} brain, tucked underneath the cerebral hemispheres. Its <b>cortical</b> <b>surface</b> is covered with finely spaced parallel grooves, in striking contrast to the broad irregular convolutions of the cerebral cortex. These parallel grooves conceal the fact that the cerebellar cortex is actually a continuous thin layer of tissue tightly folded in the style of an accordion. Within this thin layer are several types of neurons with a highly regular arrangement, the most important being Purkinje cells and granule cells. This complex neural organization gives rise to a massive signal-processing capability, but almost all of the output from the cerebellar cortex passes through a set of small deep nuclei lying in the white matter interior of the cerebellum.|$|E

25|$|To {{generate}} {{a signal that}} is detectable, approximately 50,000 active neurons are needed. Since current dipoles must have similar orientations to generate magnetic fields that reinforce each other, it is often the layer of pyramidal cells, which are situated perpendicular to the <b>cortical</b> <b>surface,</b> that gives rise to measurable magnetic fields. Bundles of these neurons that are orientated tangentially to the scalp surface project measurable portions of their magnetic fields outside of the head, and these bundles are typically located in the sulci.

40|$|Abstract: There {{is a lack}} of unified {{statistical}} modeling {{framework for}} cerebral shape asymmetry analysis in literature. Most previous approaches start with flip-ping the 3 D magnetic resonance images (MRI).

A difference of an anatomical index between these two images is used as a measure of cerebral asymmetry. We present a radically different asymmetry analysis that utilizes a novel weighted spherical harmonic representation of <b>cortical</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The weighted spherical harmonic representation is a surface smoothing technique given explicitly as a weighted linear combination of spherical harmon-ics.

40|$|Abstract. Accurate {{matching}} of <b>cortical</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{is necessary}} in many neuroscience applications. In this context diffeomorphisms are often sought, because they facilitate further statistical analysis and atlas building. Present methods for computing diffeomorphisms are based on optimizing flows or on inflating surfaces to a common template, but they are often computationally expensive. It typically takes several hours on a conventional desktop computer to match {{a single pair of}} <b>cortical</b> <b>surfaces</b> having a few hundred thousand vertices. We propose a very fast alternative based on an application of spectral graph theory on a novel association graph. Our symmetric approach can generate a diffeomorphic correspondence map within a few minutes on high-resolution meshes while avoiding the sign and multiplicity ambiguities of conventional spectral matching methods. The eigenfunctions are shared between surfaces and provide a smooth parameterization of surfaces. These properties are exploited to compute differentials on highly folded <b>cortical</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Diffeomorphisms can thus be verified and invalid surface folding detected. Our method is demonstrated to attain a vertex accuracy that is at least as good as that of FreeSurfer and Spherical Demons but in only a fraction of their processing time. As a practical experiment, we construct an unbiased atlas of <b>cortical</b> <b>surfaces</b> with a speed several orders of magnitude faster than current methods. ...|$|R
2500|$|The Notch pathway is {{essential}} for maintaining NPCs in the developing brain. Activation of the pathway is sufficient to maintain NPCs in a proliferating state, whereas loss-of-function mutations in the critical components of the pathway cause precocious neuronal differentiation and NPC depletion. Modulators of the Notch signal, e.g., the Numb protein are able to antagonize Notch effects, resulting in the halting of cell cycle and differentiation of NPCs. Conversely, the Fibroblast Growth Factor pathway promotes Notch signaling to keep stem cells of the cerebral cortex in the proliferative state, amounting to a mechanism regulating <b>cortical</b> <b>surface</b> area growth and, potentially, gyrification. [...] In this way, Notch signaling controls NPC self-renewal as well as cell fate specification.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{compare and}} {{integrate}} brain data, data from multiple subjects are typically mapped into a canonical space. One method {{to do this}} is to conformally map <b>cortical</b> <b>surfaces</b> to the sphere. It is well known that any genus zero Riemann surface can be conformally mapped to a sphere. Therefore, conformal mapping offers a convenient method to parameterize <b>cortical</b> <b>surfaces</b> without angular distortion, generating an orthogonal grid on the cortex that locally preserves the metric. To compare <b>cortical</b> <b>surfaces</b> more effectively, it is advantageous to adjust the conformal parameterizations to match consistent anatomical features across subjects. This matching of cortical patterns improves the alignment of data across subjects, although it is more challenging to create a consistent conformal (orthogonal) parameterization of anatomy across subjects when landmarks are constrained to lie at specific locations in the spherical parameter space. Here we propose a new method, based on a new energy functional, to optimize the conformal parameterization of <b>cortical</b> <b>surfaces</b> by using landmarks. Experimental results on a dataset of 40 brain hemispheres showed that the landmark mismatch energy can be greatly reduced while effectively preserving conformality. The key advantage of this conformal parameterization approach is that any local adjustments of the mapping to match landmarks do not affect the conformality of the mapping significantly. We also examined how the parameterization changes with different weighting factors. As expected, the landmark matching error can be reduced if it is more heavily penalized, but conformality is progressively reduced. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{cerebral}} cortex {{is the largest}} {{part of the human}} brain and is critical for a variety of sensory, cognitive, and motor functions. Though the functional and anatomical organization of cortex are related, the complexity and variability of the folds makes comparisons across individuals challenging. Neuroimaging often requires accurate algorithms for matching cortices. Efficient mathematical frameworks are consequently sought for analyzing data on inflated <b>cortical</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and for transfering corresponding anatomical and functional maps between subjects. Standard methods typically rely on anatomical features, including sulcal depth, to drive the alignment across individuals (Fischl et al. 1999). Recent methods can align subjects based on the similarity of neural activity patterns (Conroy et al. 2013). These present approaches typically treat each task separately and can be computationally expensive, requiring several hours to process a single subject. Here, we propose Brain Transfer, a spectral shape framework that provides fast point matching with confidence regions, and transfers of functional maps, within minutes of computation. Spectral methods have the advantage of capturing the underlying intrinsic geometry of shapes. We improved over previous spectral approaches by addressing the instabilities of geometrical harmonics (Lombaert et al. 2013). The improved normalization is key to process and analyze functional data on matched cortices. More precisely, our contributions consist of (1) the optimization of a spectral transformation matrix, which combines both, surface correspondence and normalization of geometrical harmonics, and (2) a localized spectral decomposition of functional data, via focused harmonics. This spectral transfer provides a robust formulation for spectral methods and naturally handles sign changes as well as differences across Laplacian eigenvectors. The novel focused harmonics capture the essentials of the intrinsic geometrical properties in a confidence area, and form a basis for reconstructing the shape of <b>cortical</b> <b>surfaces</b> and functional maps across subjects. Thus, Brain Transfer enables the transfer of functional data across interchangeable <b>cortical</b> <b>surfaces,</b> accounts for localized confidence, and gives a new way to perform statistics on <b>surfaces.</b> When matching <b>cortical</b> <b>surfaces</b> based on sulcal depth, we achieve similar accuracy in a fraction of the time compared to spherical-based methods.

Our approach is scale invariant and provides an accurate and anatomically meaningful alignment across the population. Registering PFS, instead of original <b>cortical</b> <b>surfaces,</b> simplifies the determination of shape correspondences, overcoming the problem of intersubject variability, while still guaranteeing the alignment of the main brain lobes and folding patterns.

40|$|Abstract. In this work, we find {{meaningful}} parameterizations of <b>cortical</b> <b>surfaces</b> utilizing prior anatomical {{information in}} the form of anatomical landmarks (sulci curves) on the surfaces. Specifically we generate close to conformal parametrizations that also give a shape-based correspondence between the landmark curves. We propose a variational energy that measures the harmonic energy of the parameterization maps, and the shape dissimilarity between mapped points on the landmark curves. The novelty is that the computed maps are guaranteed to give a shapebased diffeomorphism between the landmark curves. We achieve this by intrinsically modelling our search space of maps as flows of smooth vector fields that do not flow across the landmark curves, and by using the local surface geometry on the curves to define a shape measure. Such parameterizations ensure consistent correspondence between anatomical features, ensuring correct averaging and comparison of data across subjects. The utility of our model is demonstrated in experiments on <b>cortical</b> <b>surfaces</b> with landmarks delineated, which show that our computed maps give a shape-based alignment of the sulcal curves without significantly impairing conformality. ...|$|R
