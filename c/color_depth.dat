5|$|HDMI 2.0 {{increases}} the maximum TMDS clock to 600MHz (18.0Gbit/s). HDMI 2.0 uses 8b/10b encoding for video transmission like previous versions, {{giving it a}} maximum video bandwidth of 14.4Gbit/s. This enables HDMI 2.0 to carry 4K video at 60Hz with 24bit/px <b>color</b> <b>depth.</b> Other features of HDMI 2.0 include support for the Rec. 2020 color space, up to 32 audio channels, up to 1536kHz audio sample frequency, dual video streams to multiple users on the same screen, up to four audio streams, 4:2:0 chroma subsampling, 25 fps 3D formats, support for the 21:9 aspect ratio, dynamic synchronization of video and audio streams, the HE-AAC and DRA audio standards, improved 3D capability, and additional CEC functions.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.3 was {{released}} on June 22, 2006, and increased the maximum TMDS clock to 340MHz (10.2Gbit/s). Like previous versions, it uses 8b/10b encoding, giving it a maximum video bandwidth of 8.16Gbit/s (1920×1080 at 120Hz or 2560×1440 at 60Hz). It added support for 10bpc, 12bpc, and 16bpc <b>color</b> <b>depth</b> (30, 36, and 48bit/px), called deep color. It also added support for the xvYCC color space, {{in addition to the}} Rec. 601 and Rec. 709 color spaces supported by previous versions, and added the ability to carry metadata defining color gamut boundaries. It also optionally allows output of Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio streams for external decoding by AV receivers. It incorporates automatic audio syncing (audio video sync) capability. It defined cable Categories 1 and 2, with Category 1 cable being tested up to 74.25 MHz and Category 2 being tested up to 340 MHz. It also added the new type C Mini connector for portable devices.|$|E
5|$|Both HDMI and DVI use TMDS to send 10-bit {{characters}} that are encoded using 8b/10b encoding that {{differs from the}} original IBM form for the Video Data Period and 2b/10b encoding for the Control Period. HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using 4b/10b encoding for the Data Island Period. Each Data Island Period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32-bit Packet Header, which includes 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data for error correction and describes {{the contents of the}} packet. Each packet contains four subpackets, and each subpacket is 64 bits in size, including 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data, allowing for each packet to carry up to 224 bits of audio data. Each Data Island Period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data. Among these are the General Control Packet and the Gamut Metadata Packet. The General Control Packet carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise) and <b>Color</b> <b>Depth</b> (which sends the bit depth of the current video stream and is required for deep color). The Gamut Metadata Packet carries information on the color space being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC.|$|E
5000|$|Framebuffers have {{traditionally}} supported {{a wide variety}} of color modes. Due to the expense of memory, most early framebuffers used 1-bit (2-color), 2-bit (4-color), 4-bit (16-color) or 8-bit (256-color) <b>color</b> <b>depths.</b> The problem with such small <b>color</b> <b>depths</b> is that a full range of colors cannot be produced. The solution to this problem was to add a lookup table to the framebuffers. Each [...] "color" [...] stored in framebuffer memory would act as a color index; this scheme was sometimes called [...] "indexed color".|$|R
50|$|At WinHEC 2008, Microsoft {{announced}} that <b>color</b> <b>depths</b> of 30 bits and 48 bits would be supported in Windows 7, {{along with the}} wide color gamut scRGB (which {{can be converted to}} xvYCC output).|$|R
50|$|The PQ scheme with 10 bits of <b>color</b> bit <b>depth</b> {{has also}} been called HDR10. Similarly, the HLG scheme with 10 bits of <b>color</b> bit <b>depth</b> has been called HLG10. The Ultra HD Forum {{guidelines}} for UHD Phase A include support for SDR formats with 10 bits of <b>color</b> bit <b>depth</b> based on both Rec. 709 and Rec. 2020 color gamuts and also both the HDR10 and HLG10 formats of Rec. 2100.|$|R
5|$|HDMI 1.0 was {{released}} on December 9, 2002 and is a single-cable digital audio/video connector interface. The link architecture is based on DVI, using exactly the same video transmission format but sending audio and other auxiliary data during the blanking intervals of the video stream. HDMI 1.0 allows a maximum TMDS clock of 165MHz (4.95 Gbit/s), the same as DVI. It defined two connectors called Type A and Type B, with pinouts based on the Single-Link DVI-D and Dual-Link DVI-D connectors respectively, though the Type B connector was never used in any commercial products. HDMI 1.0 uses 8b/10b encoding for video transmission, giving it 3.96Gbit/s of video bandwidth (1920×1080 or 1920×1200 at 60Hz) and 8channel LPCM/192kHz/24-bit audio. HDMI 1.0 supported only 24bit/px <b>color</b> <b>depth</b> and required support for RGB video, with optional support for YCBCR 4:4:4 and 4:2:2 (mandatory if the device had support for YCBCR on other interfaces). Only the Rec. 601 and Rec. 709 color spaces were supported. HDMI 1.0 allowed only specific pre-defined video formats to be transmitted, including all the formats defined in EIA/CEA-861-B {{as well as some}} additional formats listed in the HDMI Specification itself. All HDMI sources are also required to be capable of sending or receiving native Single-Link DVI video and be fully compliant with the DVI Specification.|$|E
25|$|The dual link HD {{interface}} supports 1080/60p, 1080/59.94p, and 1080/50p, {{as well as}} 4:4:4 encoding, greater <b>color</b> <b>depth,</b> RGB encoding, alpha channels, and nonstandard resolutions (often {{encountered in}} computer graphics or digital cinema).|$|E
25|$|Built {{around the}} Motorola MC6845 display controller, the CGA card {{featured}} several graphics and text modes. The highest display resolution of any mode was 640200, {{and the highest}} <b>color</b> <b>depth</b> supported was 4-bit (16colors).|$|E
50|$|Display Stream Compression (DSC) uses a {{visually}} lossless low-latency algorithm {{based on}} predictive DPCM and YCoCg-R color space; it allows increased resolutions and <b>color</b> <b>depths</b> and reduced power consumption. Visually lossless compression is tested against ISO/IEC 29170-2 standard.|$|R
5000|$|Framebuffers used in {{personal}} and home computing often had sets of defined [...] "modes" [...] {{under which the}} framebuffer could operate. These modes would automatically reconfigure the hardware to output different resolutions, <b>color</b> <b>depths,</b> memory layouts and refresh rate timings.|$|R

25|$|Fixed {{bit depth}} (also called <b>color</b> <b>depth).</b> Many cheaper LCDs are {{only able to}} display 262,000 colors. 8-bit S-IPS panels can display 16million colors and have {{significantly}} better black level, but are expensive and have slower response time.|$|E
25|$|There {{is thus a}} filesize {{trade-off}} {{between high}} <b>color</b> <b>depth,</b> maximal metadata (including color space information, together with information that does not affect display), interlacing, and speed of compression, which all yield large files, with lower <b>color</b> <b>depth,</b> fewer or no ancillary chunks, no interlacing, and tuned but computationally intensive filtering and compression. For different purposes, different trade-offs are chosen: a maximal file may be best for archiving and editing, while a stripped down file may be best for use on a website, and similarly fast but poor compression is preferred when repeatedly editing and saving a file, while slow but high compression is preferred when a file is stable: when archiving or posting.|$|E
25|$|Stacked OLEDs: Stacked OLEDs use a pixel {{architecture}} that stacks the red, green, and blue subpixels {{on top of}} one another instead of next to one another, leading to substantial increase in gamut and <b>color</b> <b>depth,</b> and greatly reducing pixel gap.

25|$|CinePaint: Formerly Film Gimp, it is a fork of GIMP version 1.0.4, {{used for}} frame-by-frame {{retouching}} of feature film. CinePaint supports up to 32-bit IEEE-floating point <b>color</b> <b>depth</b> per channel, {{as well as}} color management and HDR. CinePaint is used primarily within the film industry due mainly to its support of high-fidelity image formats. It is available for BSD, Linux, and macOS.|$|E
25|$|One of its {{technical}} drawbacks is {{a limited}} texture cache, which can hold textures of limited dimensions and reduced <b>color</b> <b>depth,</b> which must be stretched to cover larger in-game surfaces. Its vintage ROM cartridges are constrained by small capacity and high production expenses, compared to the compact disc format used by its chief competitors. Some third-party publishers that supported Nintendo's previous consoles reduced their output or stopped publishing for the console; the Nintendo 64's most successful games came from first-party or second-party studios.|$|E
25|$|Additional SDI {{standards}} {{have been introduced}} to support increasing video resolutions (HD, UHD and beyond), frame rates, stereoscopic (3D) video, and <b>color</b> <b>depth.</b> Dual link HD-SDI consists {{of a pair of}} SMPTE 292M links, standardized by SMPTE 372M in 1998; this provides a nominal 2.970Gbit/s interface used in applications (such as digital cinema or HDTV 1080P) that require greater fidelity and resolution than standard HDTV can provide. 3G-SDI (standardized in SMPTE 424M) consists of a single 2.970Gbit/s serial link that allows replacing dual link HD-SDI. 6G-SDI and 12G-SDI standards were published on March 19, 2015.|$|E
50|$|Unlike SVGA {{and higher}} <b>color</b> <b>depths,</b> Mode 13h, {{part of the}} MCGA set of video modes, has 18 bits of color, 6 per channel. The palette data is not stored in memory per se, but rather modified, read and written to by low level I/O port calls, to the DAC registers.|$|R
50|$|While some {{high-end}} graphics workstation {{systems and}} the accessories marketed toward use with such systems, as from SGI, have always used more than 8 bits per channel, such as 12 or 16 (36-bit or 48-bit <b>color),</b> such <b>color</b> <b>depths</b> have only worked {{their way into the}} general market more recently.|$|R
40|$|Rate {{control is}} a very {{important}} tool for any kind of video coding and transmission. Even though there are many rate control techniques designed for 2 D video, not much work has been carried out in this area for 3 D video. In this paper, a novel rate control approach for 3 D video based on <b>color</b> and <b>depth</b> maps is introduced. The aim of this rate control algorithm is to keep the 3 D video quality near constant. Since the 3 D video is synthesized from <b>color</b> and <b>depth</b> maps and the final quality of 3 D video is more influenced by color sequence rather than depth maps, the qualities of both <b>color</b> and <b>depth</b> maps are firstly varied until the target 3 D quality is achieved with minimal bit rate. Subsequently, the PSNR of both <b>color</b> and <b>depth</b> maps at the optimum point are maintained for the entire group of picture (GOP). The bit-allocation problem is solved by introducing a Lagrangian optimization cost function. According to experimental results, the proposed rate control technique is capable to adjust the bit rate allocated to the <b>color</b> and <b>depth</b> maps sequences adaptively in order to maximize 3 D video quality which is measured by PSNR of the synthesized left and right views using reconstructed <b>color</b> and <b>depth</b> map sequences...|$|R
25|$|Early web browsers did {{not support}} PNG images; JPEG and GIF were the main image formats. JPEG was {{commonly}} used when exporting images containing gradients for web pages, because of GIF's limited <b>color</b> <b>depth.</b> However, JPEG compression causes a gradient to blur slightly. A PNG format reproduces a gradient as accurately as possible for a given bit depth, while keeping the file size small. PNG became the optimal choice for small gradient images as web browser support for the format improved. No images at all are needed to display gradients in modern browsers, as gradients can be created using CSS.|$|E
25|$|HDR images often don't use fixed ranges per color channel—other than {{traditional}} images—to represent many more colors over {{a much wider}} dynamic range. For that purpose, they don't use integer values to represent the single color channels (e.g., 0-255 in an 8 bit per pixel interval for red, green and blue) but instead use a floating point representation. Common are 16-bit (half precision) or 32-bit floating point numbers to represent HDR pixels. However, when the appropriate transfer function is used, HDR pixels for some applications can be represented with a <b>color</b> <b>depth</b> that has as few as 10–12bits for luminance and 8bits for chrominance without introducing any visible quantization artifacts.|$|E
25|$|Color performance: There are {{multiple}} terms to describe {{different aspects of}} color performance of a display. Color gamut is the range of colors that can be displayed, and <b>color</b> <b>depth,</b> which is the fineness with which the color range is divided. Color gamut is a relatively straight forward feature, but it is rarely discussed in marketing materials except at the professional level. Having a color range that exceeds the content being shown on the screen has no benefits, so displays are only made to perform within or below the range of a certain specification. There are additional aspects to LCD color and color management, such as white point and gamma correction, which describe what color white is and how the other colors are displayed relative to white.|$|E
50|$|Microsoft {{has defined}} a {{particular}} representation of color bitmaps of different <b>color</b> <b>depths,</b> {{as an aid}} to exchanging bitmaps between devices and applications with a variety of internal representations. They called these device-independent bitmaps or DIBs, and the file format for them is called DIB file format or BMP image file format.|$|R
50|$|Support for <b>color</b> <b>depths</b> of 30 and 48 bits is included, {{along with}} the wide color gamut scRGB (which for HDMI 1.3 can be {{converted}} and output as xvYCC).
