5|$|Among the ECSC's {{greatest}} achievements {{are those}} on welfare issues. Some mines, for example, were clearly unsustainable without government subsidies. Some miners had extremely poor housing. Over 15 years it financed 112,500 flats for workers, paying US$1,770 per flat, enabling workers {{to buy a}} home they could not have otherwise afforded. The ECSC also paid half the occupational redeployment costs of those workers who have lost their jobs as <b>coal</b> <b>and</b> steel facilities began to close down. Combined with regional redevelopment aid the ECSC spent $150million creating 100,000 jobs, a third of which were for unemployed <b>coal</b> <b>and</b> steel workers. The welfare guarantees invented by the ECSC were extended to workers outside the <b>coal</b> <b>and</b> steel sector by some of its members.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{development}} of the linen industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution, partly because it lacked <b>coal</b> <b>and</b> iron resources and partly because {{of the impact of the}} sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England, which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.|$|E
30|$|The R-squared {{value for}} the carbon content is 0.7336 for <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> 0.9273 for coal-shales (Figs.  5 o and 6 o). The {{relationship}} between carbon content and spontaneous combustion liability index for <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> coal-shales seems to be strong. The value for <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> coal-shales have a strong effect size. There is {{a positive relationship between}} the carbon content and spontaneous combustion liability index for both the <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> coal-shales. This means that as the carbon content increases, the oxidation capacity of <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> coal-shales are more likely to increase in general. The increasing carbon content affects the oxidation potential of both <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> coal-shales by causing a relatively high spontaneous combustion liability.|$|R
30|$|There is a {{positive}} relationship between the hydrogen content and spontaneous combustion liability index for both the <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> coal-shales. This means that as the hydrogen content increases, the oxidation capacity of <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> coal-shales is more likely to increase in general. The increasing hydrogen content affects the oxidation potential of both <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> coal-shales by causing a relatively high spontaneous combustion liability. The R-squared value for the hydrogen content is 0.5703 for <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> 0.7742 for coal-shales (Figs.  5 p and 6 p). The relationship between the hydrogen content and spontaneous combustion liability index for <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> coal-shales are a strong positive.|$|R
30|$|The R-squared {{value for}} the {{nitrogen}} content is 0.7026 for <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> 0.8953 for coal-shales (Figs.  5 q and 6 q). The relationship between the nitrogen content and spontaneous combustion liability index for <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> coal-shales are a strong positive.

5|$|At its peak, around 1917, Thistle {{had about}} 600 residents. The town's {{railroad}} infrastructure included a five-stall roundhouse, depot, machine shop, and structures to restock passing trains with sand, <b>coal</b> <b>and</b> water. Non-railroad infrastructure included general stores, a post office, barber shop, saloon, pool hall, bakeries and restaurants. The largest building was a two-story schoolhouse, built in 1911.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Industrial Revolution, Northern England had plentiful <b>coal</b> <b>and</b> water power while the poor agriculture in the uplands meant that labour in the area was cheap. Mining and milling, which had been practiced on a small scale in the area for generations, began to grow and centralise. The boom in industrial textile manufacture is sometimes attributed to the damp climate and soft water making it easier to wash and work fibres, although the success of Northern fabric mills has no single clear source. Readily available <b>coal</b> <b>and</b> the discovery of large iron deposits in Cumbria and Cleveland allowed ironmaking and, with the invention of the Bessemer process, steelmaking to take root in the region. High quality steel in turn fed the shipyards that opened along the coasts, especially on Tyneside and at Barrow-in-Furness.|$|E
5|$|Belgium was {{the first}} country in {{continental}} Europe to experience the Industrial Revolution, and was the most intensively industrialized {{country in the world}} throughout most of the period. Belgian industrialized rapidly over the nineteenth century, with a focus on iron, <b>coal</b> <b>and</b> textile production. By 1914, Belgium had extensive rail networks, mines and factories, and a productive export sector.|$|E
30|$|This study {{evaluated}} the intrinsic properties of some South African bituminous <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> coal-shales using characterisation tests (proximate, ultimate and petrographic analyses), following standard experimental procedures. Furthermore, a statistical interpretation of <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> coal-shales analysis {{data and the}} combined effects of the major intrinsic factors affecting their liability towards spontaneous combustion for predictive purposes were examined. An understanding of these factors may be important in understanding the spontaneous combustion liability of <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> coal-shales in <b>coal</b> mines.|$|R
30|$|The R-squared {{value for}} {{volatile}} matter is considered as 0.2666 for <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> 0.4763 for coal-shales (Figs.  5 b and 6 m). This {{is an indication}} that both <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> coal-shales have a moderate effect size. There is a positive relationship between volatile matter and spontaneous combustion liability index for both cases. This means that as the volatile matter increases, the oxidation capacity of <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> coals-shales is more likely to increase in general. This is in-line with the study reported on <b>coal</b> by Singh <b>and</b> Demirbilek (1987).|$|R
30|$|There is a {{negative}} relationship between the ash content and spontaneous combustion liability index for both <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> coal-shales. This means that as ash content increases, the spontaneous combustion liability decreases. This is in-line with the study reported on <b>coal</b> by Beamish <b>and</b> Blazak (2005), Singh and Demirbilek (1987). The relationship between the ash content and spontaneous combustion liability index seems to be strong. The R-squared value is 0.75 for <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> 0.8926 for coal-shales (Figs.  5 n and 6 n). The value for <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> coal-shales have a strong effect size. The decreasing ash content affects the oxidation potential by causing a relatively high spontaneous combustion liability for both <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> coal-shales analysed. This is in-line with the studies reported on <b>coal</b> by Beamish <b>and</b> Arisoy (2008), Humphreys et al. (1981), Panigrahi and Sahu (2004); Smith et al. (1988).|$|R
5|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>and</b> other {{minerals}} were extracted {{in the west}} of Scotland from medieval times; getting the heavy product to market was always a challenge, and this encouraged the development of tracked systems; the earliest plateways {{in the vicinity of}} Ayr date from—at the latest—1775.|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{buildings}} {{in the area around}} the colliery caused by subsidence led to it becoming uneconomic despite its sitting on large reserves of high-quality <b>coal,</b> <b>and</b> it was closed in 1968. The site was cleared and is now occupied by the City of Manchester Stadium.|$|E

5|$|However the ECSC {{failed to}} achieve several {{fundamental}} aims of the Treaty of Paris. It was hoped the ECSC would prevent a resurgence of large <b>coal</b> <b>and</b> steel {{groups such as the}} Konzerne, which helped Adolf Hitler rise to power. In the Cold War trade-offs, the cartels and major companies re-emerged, leading to apparent price fixing (another element that was meant to be tackled). With a democratic supervisory system the worst aspects of past abuse were avoided with the anti-cartel powers of the Authority, the first international anti-cartel agency in the world. Efficient firms were allowed to expand into a European market without undue domination. Oil, gas, electricity became natural competitors to <b>coal</b> <b>and</b> also broke cartel powers. Furthermore, with the move to oil, the Community failed to define a proper energy policy. The Euratom treaty was largely stifled by de Gaulle and the European governments refused the suggestion of an Energy Community involving electricity and other vectors that was suggested at Messina in 1955. In a time of high inflation and monetary instability ECSC also fell short of ensuring an upward equalisation of pay of workers within the market. These failures could be put down to overambition {{in a short period of}} time, or that the goals were merely political posturing to be ignored. It has been argued that the greatest achievements of the European <b>Coal</b> <b>and</b> Steel Community lie in its revolutionary democratic concepts of a supranational Community.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, facing {{cash flow}} problems, John Cleveland Osgood turned to George Jay Gould, a {{principal}} stockholder of the Denver and Rio Grande, for a loan. Gould, via Frederick Taylor Gates, Rockefeller's financial adviser, brought John D. Rockefeller {{in to help}} finance the loan. Analysis of the company's operations by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. showed a need for substantially more funds which were provided in exchange for acquisition of CF's subsidiaries such as the Colorado and Wyoming Railway Company, the Crystal River Railroad Company, and possibly the Rocky Mountain <b>Coal</b> <b>and</b> Iron Company. Control was passed from the Iowa Group to Gould and Rockefeller interests in 1903 with Gould in control and Rockefeller and Gates representing a minority interests. Osgood left the company in 1904 and devoted his efforts to operating competing <b>coal</b> <b>and</b> coke operations.|$|E
5|$|In some select cases, {{pipelines}} {{can even}} transport solids, such as <b>coal</b> <b>and</b> other minerals, over long distances; short distance {{transportation of goods}} such as grain, cement, concrete, solid wastes, pulp etc. is also feasible.|$|E
30|$|Figures  5 r and 6 r {{show the}} effect of {{calculated}} oxygen on the spontaneous combustion liability of the <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> coal-shales obtained from the linear regression analysis. The evaluation of the calculated oxygen indicated a negative correlation for the <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> a positive correlation for the coal-shales. As the correlation (Fig.  5 r) displays R-squared of 0.0103 for coals, {{it shows that the}} linear model does not fit well. It is different for the coal-shales. Here, the R-squared is a bit higher, 0.1052, than the <b>coals.</b> The <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> coal-shales have a very weak effect size.|$|R
40|$|To {{predict the}} {{combustion}} performance in pulverized coal-fired boilers, this paper examines existing indices and develops a maceral index (MI). These indices {{were compared with}} the data of 68 <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> blends {{in a range of}} the mean vitrinite reflectance from 0. 25 to 1. 63. The results showed that the fuel ratio and the mean vitrinite reflectance could qualitatively indicate the burnout of the <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> blends. The new MI, MI = L + V/R- 2 /I- 1. 25 (HV/ 30) (2. 5), provides a useful correlation for the burnout of the <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> blends. The correlation coefficient (I-) is 0. 982 for the EER data, and 0. 808 for the ACIRL data. The MI also has potential to correlate ignition and flame stability of the <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> blends. The MI predicts the burnout better than the other indices. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|The R-squared {{value for}} pyritic sulphur is 0.0076 for <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> 0.3254 for coal-shales (Figs.  5 i and 6 i). This is in-line {{with the study}} {{reported}} on <b>coal</b> by Singh <b>and</b> Demirbilek (1987). The evaluation of the pyritic sulphur indicated a positive correlation coefficient for both the <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> coal-shales. This means that as the pyritic sulphur increases, the oxidation potential of <b>coals</b> <b>and</b> coal-shales {{is more likely to}} increase in general. The scatter plots show that the corresponding spontaneous combustion liability values display a wide variation. The value for coals have a very weak effect size, while coal-shales have a moderate effect size. The linear regression analysis was quite similar to those obtained from the total sulphur content data.|$|R

5|$|Nichols {{left the}} Atomic Energy Commission in 1955 {{and opened a}} {{consulting}} firm on K Street, specializing in commercial atomic energy research and development. His clients included Alcoa, Gulf Oil, Westinghouse Electric Corporation and the Yankee Rowe Nuclear Power Station.

They were both experimental and not expected to be competitive with <b>coal</b> <b>and</b> oil, but later became more so due to inflation and large increases in <b>coal</b> <b>and</b> oil prices. He was critical of over-regulation and protracted hearings, which meant that by the 1980s similar boiling-water or pressurized-water plants took almost twice as long to build in the United States as in France, Japan, Taiwan or South Korea.|$|E
