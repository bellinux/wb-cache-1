50|$|This {{site is a}} part of the Wadden Sea on the North Sea coast, {{about 40}} km north of the city of Bremerhaven in the Land of Hamburg. Situated close to the mouth of the Elbe River, it {{represents}} an estuary system which is the habitat for the seal Phoca vitulina and a large diversity of birds and fish. The nutrient-rich waters of the Elbe support a high biomass production and are important for fish spawning. The site includes sand and mudflats with <b>channels,</b> <b>islands</b> and saltmarshes. The site has been designated as a National Park, Ramsar site and EU Special Protection Area for wild birds.38 people are living in the biosphere reserve (1998). The main human activities at the site are recreation and tourism and some agricultural practices such as livestock grazing. The adjacent waters north to the biosphere reserve are intensively used by ships, so that potential oil spills are a major threat to the site. Also, pollution stemming from the Elbe River impacts the ecosystem. An information centre on the Neuwerk Island provides an exhibition and educational materials for tourists.The major ecosystem type is temperate coastal/marine zone. The major habitats & land cover types are tidal flats with benthic microalgae and seagrass (Zostera marina and Z. nana); salt marshes with Puccinellia maritima, Festuca rubra, Juncus gerardii, Aster tripolium etc.; sand dunes with Agropyron spp., lyme grass (Elymus arenarius) and marram (Ammophila arenaria).|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the spatial {{variation in the}} Kansas River (USA) fish assemblage to determine how fish community structure changes with habitat complexity in a large river. Fishes were collected at ten sites throughout the Kansas River for assessing assemblage structure in summer 2007. Aerial imagery indicated riparian land use within 200 m from the river edge was dominated by agriculture in the upper river reaches (. 35 %) and tended to increase in urban land use in the lower reaches (. 58 %). Instream habitat complexity (number of braided <b>channels,</b> <b>islands)</b> also decreased with increased urban area (, 25 %). Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that species that prefer high-velocity flows and sandy substrate (e. g., blue sucker Cycleptus elongatus and shovelnose sturgeon Scaphirhynchus platorynchus) {{were associated with the}} upper river reaches. Abundance of omnivorous and planktivorous fish species were also higher in the lower river. The presence of fluvial dependent and fluvial specialist species was associated with sites with higher water flows, more sand bars, and log jams. Our results suggest that conserving intolerant, native species in the Kansas River may require maintaining suitable habitat for these species and restoration of impacted areas of the river.

40|$|This study {{characterizes the}} macrobenthic {{gradients}} in Ria de Aveiro, Western Portugal. Ria de Aveiro is the meeting {{place of a}} number of river basins, resulting in a transition system of complex geometry, with channels running parallel to the coast line, north and south of the entrance, but also inland, creating an intricate system of navigation <b>channels,</b> <b>islands</b> and intertidal sand and mudflats. This renders unique characteristics to this system within the framework of transitional waters. The study was based on the analysis of samples from 248 sites, covering the full salinity gradient and the entire channel system. A total of 120 taxa in more than 76, 350 specimens were identified. The most abundant and frequent taxa were all annelids, namely Alkmaria romijni, Streblospio shrubsolii, Tharyx sp., Tubificoides benedii, Nereis diversicolor, Capitella sp., Pygospio elegans, Polydora ligni and an unidentified oligochaete. The spatial distribution of the fauna was found to be mainly related to hydrodynamics and the salinity gradient, whereas sediment grain-size characteristics were much less important. Shear stress, flux, current velocity, salinity and sediment redox potential were the environmental variables which best related to the biological data. Benthic assemblages succeed from the euhaline pole, at the entrance, to the limnetic poles, located in the inner parts of the channels. In this succession, mean abundance increased from the outward to the inward assemblages but species richness and diversity were higher in intermediate assemblages. These descriptors decrease abruptly in the limnetic areas. Using the M-AMBI index, the ecological quality of Ria de Aveiro revealed moderate, poor and bad status. However, the ecological status spatial trend closely followed the benthic assemblages succession, their species richness and diversity, indicating the need for proper reference conditions and inter-calibration exercises in the transition waters before final assessment and conclusions about the use of such indices may be drawn...|$|E

40|$|The Platte River of south-central Nebraska was {{studied at}} three scales {{to place the}} river in its {{geological}} context and to trace its evolution through geologic time. At the largest scale the Elm Creek West and the Newark 7. 5 minute quadrangles were mapped. These quadrangles are located just west and just east of Kearney and serve to illustrate the main geomorphic elements of the present Platte River Valley. The central elements of the quadrangles are the Platte River <b>channels,</b> <b>islands,</b> and bottomlands, which are flanked by terraces that step up away from the river {{to the north and}} south. Significant other elements of the landscape are eolian sand and loess deposits. The geologic maps are supplemented by topographic profi les of the mapped terraces and graphical representations of subsurface units in test wells that occur within the quadrangles. An intermediate-scale study consisted of examining descriptions of well cuttings in a 17 county area in south-central Nebraska, which includes the Platte River Valley, and building a database of information about sediment lithology and thickness. The wells penetrated a sequence of gravel, sand, silt, and clay beds from the ground surface {{to the top of the}} subsurface Tertiary Ogallala Group or Cretaceous formations. The sequence consists of Pliocene-, Pleistocene-, and Holocene-age strata that document the deposition of a veneer of alluvium by late Tertiary and Quaternary streams intermixed with and overlain by wind-blown loess. Various isopleth and structure maps illustrate the distribution and alluvial architecture of the sedimentary sequence, and support the interpretation of former positions of the Platte River. A regional-scale study consisted of documenting the geo- logic history of the Front Range and adjacent mountains and depositional areas east of the mountains in Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas, and Nebraska from the end of the Cretaceous Period, about 65 million years ago, to the present. The structural and sedimentary history of the region is outlined, and a series of paleogeographic maps shows the development of the drainage system in the east-central Rocky Mountains and adjacent Plains. Ancestral South Platte, North Platte, and Laramie Rivers are recognized as early as the late Eocene, although the South Platte probably fl owed to the southeast from the mountain front at that time. Deposits of the North Platte River are recognized on the west side of the Medicine Bow Mountains of Wyoming in the Miocene, and the presence of distinctive rock clasts indicates that the Laramie River fl owed from the North Park area of Colorado northeast across a filled Laramie Basin and the Laramie Range of southeastern Wyoming in the Miocene. The present drainage system developed in the late Miocene to the Pliocene and included the capture and diversion of the South Platte River into its present channel. The combined North and South Platte Rivers deposited gravel and sand across Nebraska and fl owed southeast from Kearney, Nebraska through the middle to late Pleistocene. Within the past 25, 000 years the Platte River below Kearney was captured and diverted into its present course and confined there by bounding valley walls of loess...|$|E
40|$|El trabajo pretende relacionar la morfología costera del estuario de Bahía Blanca con los ambientes del área {{continental}} pampeana, con el fin de definir los procesos que dieron lugar a su formación. El estudio se basó en el análisis y procesamiento de cartas imágenes del IGM utilizando un Sistema de Información Geográfica, sumándose la digitalización de imágenes satelitales y corroborado por estudios de campo. El área de estudio, que comprende desde el sudeste de la provincia de La Pampa hasta el estuario de Bahía Blanca, fue cubierta por un relevamiento aéreo que completó la información obtenida en el gabinete y perfiles geológicos de campo. Las unidades presentes se encuadran en el dominio continental y de transición. El primero de ellos está constituido por depósitos aluviales y valles ubicados estos últimos principalmente en el sudoeste de la Prov. de La Pampa, los cuales se agrupan según sus características de origen y desembocadura en tres conjuntos con extensiones de 100 km y relieves mínimos de - 40 m. El dominio de transición incluye planicies y canales de marea, islas, salitrales, marismas y playas de arena. Algunos de estos ambientes están constituidos por sedimentos finos y colonizados por spartinas y salicornias. La estructura sedimentaria suele estar afectada por procesos bioingenieriles. El estuario de Bahía Blanca es el resultado de las interacciones de ambos dominios ocurridas durante el Pleistoceno tardío - Holoceno. La presencia del río Colorado y los valles alineados del sudeste pampeano indicarían un conjunto de formas vinculadas entre sí y al estuario donde, a partir de los 7. 000 años AP los aportes sedimentarios depositados iniciaron nuevamente un modelado bajo características deltaicas que se inició en el Pleistoceno. Con posterioridad las condiciones climáticas existentes afectaron las variaciones del nivel del mar, las cuales impactaron en las geoformas preexistentes, alterando su fisonomía y formando {{a su vez}} nuevas unidades. Los posteriores cambios de rumbo del río Colorado y la ausencia de drenajes del área pampeana, capturados en las depresiones salinas, limitaron los aportes hidrológicos al área estuarial. Estos eventos permitieron el incremento de la influencia marina conformando diversos procesos cuyo resultado final fue un sistema de erosión-acreción. Evidencias de esta situación se halla en la conformación de los canales de marea, en el incremento del número y superficie de sus planicies de marea y marismas y en la degradación de sus islas. The {{characteristics of}} the drainage basins {{are one of the}} most important factors defining the origin and evolution of estuaries. In the case of the Bahía Blanca Estuary (Fig. 1), the presence of morphologic units such as the Colorado River and a series of depressions in the SW of La Pampa Province is connected to the genesis and evolution of the estuary since the Pleistocene. The aim of the present article is to establish the possible paleomorphologic relationships between the estuary and the adjacent continental environment. Bahía Blanca Estuary is the reception basin of a drainage basin located in the Southwest of the Buenos Aires Province, having a surface of the order of 3000 km 2. The coast of the estuary can be divided in two sectors. To the north, it has a NW-SE orientation, whereas, to the west, the coast trends approximately N-S. The former has over 110 km in length between Salitral de la Vidriera and Baliza Monte Hermoso and the latter is located between the salitral and Laberinto Pt. with 130 km. To study the evolution of the area, visual analysis of satellite image charts from the IGM (scales 1 : 100. 000 and 1 : 250. 000) were employed. Once the morphologic unities were identified, they were digitized and assembled in a Geographic Information System (GIS) supported on the Landsat 7 satellite image ETM Path/Row 227 - 087 provided by CONAE. All IGM topographic charts of the area were also digitized and transferred to the GIS. A total of 8 field surveys were made to define the geomorphologic and geologic conditions and topographic surveys of the valleys and depressions were also performed. Furthermore, an aerial survey of the estuary and its surroundings were made. Two units were defined as Continental and Transitional domains (Fig. 1). In the former, the morphology is defined by the subaerial sedimentation processes associated to the presence and evolution of the hydrographic basin. The Transitional Domain includes the coastal and estuarine sectors. On the Continental Domain we determined the presence of geomorphologic units such as alluvial, aeolic and fluvial deposits, dune fields, sand strandflats and valleys and depressions. The latter are aligned and related to previous faulting which may be directly related to the origin of the estuary. Part of these alignments are below mean sea level (- 20 m) and formed by canyons and valleys containing dunes of varied shapes. These valleys have been arranged in three groups. Group I starts on the NW of Lihué Calel Hills and formed two alignments having a NW-SE and E-W trends. Both follow the Chasicó - Salinas Chicas depression, continuing into the Salitral de la Vidriera and the Canal Principal. The second group is 120 km in length formed by the alignment passing through the Blanca Grande and Callaquéo lagoons, ending in the Chasicó - Salinas Chicas depression. The alignments in Group II are mostly trending in the E-W direction starting at the confluence between the Colorado and Salado rivers ending in the Chasicó - Salinas Chicas depression. Group III is independent of the other two and its alignments are related to the Colorado River directed towards the southern portion of the estuary. The most significant axis has a length of 140 km and relates the Anzoátegui and La Gotera salt lagoons with Falsa and Verde bays. The fluvial discharge along the three groups provided the hydric connexion between the continent and the littoral environments developing the initial stages of the formation of the Bahía Blanca Estuary. On the other hand, the morphologic unities in the transitional unit are: tidal flats (active and inactive), salt marshes, tidal <b>channels,</b> <b>islands,</b> sandy beaches and spits, and cliffs (Fig. 2). Since the Pleistocene, Bahía Blanca Estuary was affected by complex transformations due to climatic changes, alternation of dry and humid periods, and changes in the mean sea level (Aguirre, 1995). Between 9. 500 and 7. 500 yrs BP mean sea level increased to - 25 m (Aguirre, 1995) or between - 12 and - 18 m (Aliotta and Perillo, 1990) (Fig. 3). The area presently occupied by the estuary was subaerial (Fig. 4 a). Later on, the climate changed to warmer and more humid conditions (Aguirre, 1995) and the mean sea level increased to approximately the present conditions. Rivers introduced a large sediment load coming from the three groups and the Ventana Hill System developing a delta. Sediments were redistributed by the estuarine dynamics developing tidal flats, shoals, spits and islands. Due to the low slope and wide valleys, river velocities in the Group I were very low allowing only the transport of fine materials. About 6000 yrs BP the humidity and temperature was still increasing (Quattrocchio and Borromei, 1998), which induced further increase of the mean sea level reaching values of 5 to 12 m above present conditions (González, 1984). These values are further related to similar studies made by Cavallotto et al. (1999) for the Río de la Plata and Aliotta et al. (2000) for Arroyo Parejas. Because of the higher sea level, the delta was fully covered by the sea reaching the continent through the Salitral de la Vidriera. Although between 5. 000 and 4. 500 yrs BP the climatic conditions were stable, fluvial discharge reduced significantly inducing a sea level reduction to 2 - 3 m above present level and some of the higher islands became dry. Towards 3000 yrs BP, climate changed to temperate-dry, similar to the present conditions (Aguirre, 1995), which determined the disappearance of the rivers being replaced by aeolic environments. Consequently, the Colorado River only discharged in the depressions and to the axis La Adela - Algarrobo - canal del Embudo, while it progressively migrated southward. In this migration, the river occupied and later released the axis Salinas de Anzoátegui - La Gotera - Bahía Falsa. About 2000 yrs ago, the connexion between the continental and transitional environments (Salitral de la Vidriera) was transformed in a coastal lagoon. Wind action transported eastward the original sand deposits from southeast of La Pampa Province, forming extensive dune fields. This material also covered the Verde, Ariadna and Monte Is., located to the south of the estuary. Recently, Spalletti and Isla (2002) found at the mouth of the Colorado Nuevo River, to the south of the indicated islands, the presence of a lobular prograding shelf delta originated by marine reworking...|$|E
