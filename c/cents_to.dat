5|$|Prior to {{the mid-19th}} century, coyote fur was {{considered}} worthless. This {{changed with the}} diminution of beavers, and by 1860, the hunting of coyotes for their fur became {{a great source of}} income (75 <b>cents</b> <b>to</b> $1.50 per skin) for wolfers in the Great Plains. Coyote pelts were of significant economic importance during the early 1950s, ranging in price from $5 to $25 per pelt, depending on locality. The coyote's fur is not durable enough to make rugs, but can be used for coats and jackets, scarves, or muffs. The majority of pelts are used for making trimmings, such as coat collars and sleeves for women's clothing. Coyote fur is sometimes dyed black as imitation silver fox.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of the team in Canada was a major contributor; {{at the time the}} exchange rate was 67U.S. <b>cents</b> <b>to</b> the Canadian dollar. Because revenue was collected in Canadian dollars but player and coach salaries were paid in U.S. dollars, the team ended up spending an undue amount of its revenue on salaries. The 1998–99 lockout was the pivoting point for home game attendance. While the whole league experienced a drop in attendance after the lockout, Vancouver experienced an even larger fall. The average attendance in 1997–98 was 16,108, ranking 16th in the league, while it fell to 13,899 in 1999–00, ranking 27th.|$|E

Cohen looked for a new publisher to buy the magazines, but in September of the following year sold his half-share in the company to his partner, Arthur Bernhard. White had occasionally suggested to Cohen that Amazing would benefit from a redesign and investment; he made the same suggestions to Bernhard in early October. According to White, Bernhard not only said no, but told him he would not receive a salary until the next issue was turned in. In late 1978 White resigned, and returned all manuscripts in his possession to their authors, even if copy-edited and ready for publication. White claimed Bernhard had told him to do this, though Bernhard denied it.|$|E

She did that every day for almost three decades, interrupted only by periods when she was incapacitated by acute attacks of arthritis. She scrimped and saved, and by the time she was in her 40s, she had enough to buy a shophouse in Club Street.

When there was no response, he accosted Comstock in his office and dragged him to the dealership, where some young children, whom Reichenbach had hired for fifty cents each, lusted over the display.

40|$|Background & objectives: Aeromonas {{species have}} been {{reported}} to cause various illnesses in humans such as wound infections, septicaemia, peritonitis and pneumonia. Their role in causation of cholera-like illness is also being increasingly recognized. This retrospective study was done to know the presence of Aeromonas as a cause of acute diarrhoea in a tertiary care hospital and to find the common species of Aeromonas causing diarrhoea and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Methods: Fifty isolates of Aeromonas were obtained over a period of 15 yr from 2000 to 2014 from patients of suspected acute gastroenteritis resembling cholera. Biotyping was done for 35 of these isolates available in culture collection, based on a panel of 13 biochemical reactions. Antibiogram was put up for all of these isolates by disk diffusion methods and interpreted according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Results: Of the 50 patients of Aeromonas-related acute gastroenteritis, 13 (26 %) had typical features of cholera with rice water stools and severe dehydration. Eight patients (16 %) had dysentery-like picture. One patient died of severe dehydration and septicaemia. The most common species were found to be Aeromonas caviae (34 %) followed by Aeromonas veronii biovar veronii (29 %), Aeromonas veronii biovar sobria (26 %) and Aeromonas hydrophila (9 %). All tested isolates were uniformly susceptible to cefepime, amikacin, azithromycin and meropenem; 14 per <b>cent</b> were susceptible <b>to</b> amoxicillin, 32 per <b>cent</b> <b>to</b> nalidixic acid, 60 per <b>cent</b> <b>to</b> co-trimoxazole, 54 per <b>cent</b> <b>to</b> ciprofloxacin, 60 per <b>cent</b> <b>to</b> ofloxacin, 74 per <b>cent</b> <b>to</b> chloramphenicol, 76 per <b>cent</b> <b>to</b> ceftriaxone, 74 per <b>cent</b> <b>to</b> cefotaxime, 88 per <b>cent</b> <b>to</b> gentamicin and 86 per <b>cent</b> <b>to</b> furoxone. Interpretation & conclusions: Aeromonas is an important, often neglected pathogen capable of causing a variety of gastrointestinal tract symptoms such as acute diarrhoea and dysentery and may even mimic cholera. It is, therefore, pertinent to recognize this pathogen as an important agent in the causation of severe diarrhoea...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, in {{an attempt}} to avoid losing large {{quantities}} of circulating nickels to melting, the United States Mint introduced new interim rules on December 14, 2006, that criminalized the melting and export of pennies (which as of 2013 cost 1.83 <b>cents</b> <b>to</b> produce) and nickels. Violators of these rules can be punished with a fine of up to $10,000, five years imprisonment, or both. The rules were finalized on April 17, 2007. The melt value of a nickel for some time was more than five cents, including nearing over one-and-a-half times its face value in May 2007. Since then, the supply and demand of the coin's composition metals have stabilized. A nickel's melt value fell below its face value from late 2008 through mid-2010, and more recently again from late mid-2012 through the present. In February 2014, it was reported that the Mint was conducting experiments to use copper-plated zinc (the same composition used for the United States 1 cent coin) for the nickel.|$|E
