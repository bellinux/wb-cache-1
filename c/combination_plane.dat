30|$|Finally, {{participants}} in the Bots for Tots workshop frequently shared and critiqued toy designs. As one group worked on a <b>combination</b> <b>plane</b> and car toy, another group decided that they too should include a car component to satisfy their preK client. However, rather than simply copy this idea, they converted the car to a skateboard {{to be used with}} their in-construction doll. Groups also offered advice and suggestions for one another’s designs. For example, one team suggested that they needed to build a toy that combined a car and a plane. When discussing which materials to use when making the wings and wheels, a participant from another team suggested something “squishy” so that the toy would be more pleasant to hold. Another designer quickly spoke up stating, “I disagree that the wings should be squishy! Isn’t it an airplane and is supposed to fly? So how’s it going to fly if the wings are squishy!” This atmosphere of collaboration encouraged participants to continually improve of their own designs as well as to be invested in the work and designs of their colleagues resulting in not only shared ideas, but also shared expertise.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- A biaxial sheet {{testing device}} was {{developed}} that prescribe arbitrary strain paths as a <b>combination</b> of <b>plane</b> strain tension and simple shear. In this way orthogonal strain paths changes {{with and without}} unloading can be obtained as well as cyclic shear loading with combined stretching. This relatively simple strain path yields interesting re-sults in stress space when the stress crosses through the elastic domain. INTRODUCTION: Sheet metal forming often includes biaxial in-plane deformation with non-proportional strain paths. E. g. in deep drawing of a cylindrical cup, the deformation in the flange is dominated by pure shear deformation, while it changes to plane strain when the material is drawn in into the wall area. Nontheless, only uniaxial tensile tests are commonly performed to characterize the material...|$|R

In the present implementation the exchange potential and polarization effects {{are not considered}} and all results are obtained at the static level of approximation. For all molecules, except H 2, our calculated DCS agree reasonably well with avaliable experimental data and with other theoretical results (obtained at the static-exchange level of approximation).

In this {{paper we propose a}} new watermarking technique, based on bit plane, which enhances robustness and capacity of the watermark, as well as maintains transparency of the watermark and fidelity of the image. In the proposed technique, higher strength bit plane of digital signature watermark is embedded in to a significant bit plane of the original image. The <b>combination</b> of bit <b>planes</b> (image and watermark) selection is an important issue. Therefore, a mechanism is developed for appropriate bit plane selection. Ten different attacks are selected to test different alternatives. These attacks are given different weightings as appropriate to user requirement. A weighted correlation coefficient for retrieved watermark is estimated for each of the alternatives. Based on these estimated values optimal bit <b>plane</b> <b>combination</b> is identified for a given user requirement. The proposed method is found to be useful for authentication and to prove legal ownership.

Characterizing an optical system {{in relation to a}} plane wave with those given parameters can then be used to predict its response to a more general case, since a wave with any specified spatial structure can be decomposed into a <b>combination</b> of <b>plane</b> waves (its so-called angular spectrum).

A {{very small number of}} orthogonalizations of the set of eigenvectors is required by the proposed method, just one per RQI iteration, which is one of its key advantages because, for large enough systems, orthogonalization is the costliest component of the calculation.

30|$|The comment {{columns of}} Tables  5, 6 are of {{particular}} importance for images that possess per design the oblique Bravais lattice type and plane symmetry group p 1, i.e., images # 1 to # 3.
