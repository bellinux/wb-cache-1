According to eyewitnesses, the burning aircraft circled over Kaifenheim, losing an engine, which fell down into a garden on Bachstraße after bouncing off a roof. Had it broken through the roof, it might well have killed {{the woman who was}} sleeping in the house at the time. A gunner came down, too, complete with his machine gun and turret, falling onto Hauptstraße (the village’s main street). The bomber then crashed in a meadow near the outlying <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> Besch, <b>bursting</b> into flames easily owing to the load of white phosphorus incendiary bombs that it had been carrying. Nobody on the ground was injured, and even buildings were spared any significant damage. The recently gathered harvest was left unscathed. As a memorial, and to give thanks for deliverance from what might have been a much worse disaster, a Heiligenhäuschen (a small, shrinelike structure consecrated to a saint or saints) with a Madonna was built.|$|R

40|$|Observations of {{the solar}} radio {{spectrum}} have been made with high time and frequency resolution. Spectra were recorded over six 3 MHz bands between 30 and 82 MHz. The receivers used were capable of time and frequency resolutions of 1 ms and 2 kHz respectively. A large number <b>of</b> radio <b>bursts</b> exhibiting a variety of fine spectral structure were recorded. The most interesting bursts recorded, referred to as solar S bursts, were identified with radio emission previously described by Ellis (Aust. J. Phys., 22, 177, 1969) who called them fast drift storm bursts. Improved time and frequency resolution has allowed a much closer study than did the original observations. The bursts were observed throughout the 30 - 82 MHz frequency range but were most numerous in the 33 - 44 MHz band and were very rare at 80 MHz. On a dynamic spectrum the bursts appeared as narrow sloping lines with the <b>centre</b> frequency <b>of</b> each <b>burst</b> decreasing with time. The rate of frequency drift was about 1 / 3 that <b>of</b> type III <b>bursts.</b> The variation <b>of</b> frequency drift rate with wave frequency was consistent with their being emitted from plasma radiation sources which were travelling out {{of the solar}} corona with a constant velocity. Most bursts were observed over only a limited frequency range (< 5 MHz) but some drifted for more than 10 MHz.

40|$|Two short (< 2 s) gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have {{recently}} been localized and fading afterglow counterparts detected. The combination of these two results left unclear {{the nature of the}} host galaxies <b>of</b> the <b>bursts,</b> because one was a star-forming dwarf, while the other was probably an elliptical galaxy. Here we report the X-ray localization <b>of</b> a short <b>burst</b> (GRB 050724) with unusual gamma-ray and X-ray properties. The X-ray afterglow lies off the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> an elliptical galaxy at a redshift of z = 0. 258 (ref. 5), coincident with the position determined by ground-based optical and radio observations. The low level of star formation typical for elliptical galaxies makes it unlikely that the burst originated in a supernova explosion. A supernova origin was also ruled out for GRB 050709 (refs 3, 31), even though that burst took place in a galaxy with current star formation. The isotropic energy for the short bursts is 2 - 3 orders of magnitude lower than that for the long bursts.
