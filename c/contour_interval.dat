50|$|Of course, to {{determine}} differences in elevation between two points, the <b>contour</b> <b>interval,</b> or distance in altitude between two adjacent contour lines, must be known, {{and this is}} normally stated in the map key. Usually contour intervals are consistent throughout a map, but there are exceptions. Sometimes intermediate contours are present in flatter areas; these can be dashed or dotted lines at half the noted <b>contour</b> <b>interval.</b> When contours are used with hypsometric tints on a small-scale map that includes mountains and flatter low-lying areas, {{it is common to}} have smaller intervals at lower elevations so that detail is shown in all areas. Conversely, for an island which consists of a plateau surrounded by steep cliffs, it is possible to use smaller intervals as the height increases.|$|E
