Focus groups identified a primary concern with the food safety and a secondary interest on {{the environmental impact of}} production practices. Two alternative national <b>certification</b> <b>seals</b> were proposed: 1) a "Blue Seal" certifying the Department of Public Health's approval for food safety; and 2) a "Green Seal" certifying Ministry of Agriculture's approval for environmentally sound production practices. Three other attributes were selected: "Appearance", "Size", and "Price". These attributes, together with the proposed labels, were presented in different combinations to a sample of 432 Costa Rican consumers at ten supermarkets located in the urban Central Valley. The results of the multinomial logit model demonstrate that the attributes "Appearance" and "Price" the have the strongest influence over the probability choosing alternative scenarios. Also, there was a significant preference for the "Blue Seal" and the "Blue Seal" and "Green Seal" combined. The socioeconomic variables turned out to be not significant in consumer choice. The results show a MWTP of 20 % for the "Blue Seal" certifying healthy produce, and an additional 19 % for the "Green Seal".

For the perishable nature of Aloe Vera raw materials, they go under a stabilization process that fulfills the final consumer requirements. Many of the companies certify their raw materials, processes and final products in order to guarantee to the final consumer the origin, purity, and product content, besides the ethical strictness of their promotional and commercial information. The certifying council (International Aloe Science Council) express in their promotion that certified companies are more competitive than those that don't certify their products. However, since the lack of evidences of this fact and the high cost that represents this certification for the small companies, a study was made to determine through the consultation of the Aloe Vera industry directives in Mexico, if such effect is perceived. The study information was obtained by means of questionnaires and interviews with directive of companies of Tamaulipas, Yucatan, Durango and the Texas's Valley. The results showed that the factors with more impact in the competitiveness of Aloe Vera industry in Mexico are product quality and capacity of the company directives.

40|$|Abstract — Civil {{construction}} causes {{many environmental}} impacts, mainly {{with regard to}} the widespread use of non-renewable inputs, high energy consumption and major waste production. In the international market there are various systems for assessing the sustainability of buildings, most of which are conceived by the so-called developed countries. Analysis of the origin of such systems gives an idea of the perceived stronger emphasis on environmental aspects. In Brazil special emphasis is on the AQUA regulation, the first tool developed in the country to assess sustainability of buildings. Inspired by the French HQE system, it was launched on April 3, 2008, by Vanzolini Foundation and was the first <b>certification</b> <b>seal</b> of sustainable constructions adapted to the Brazilian reality. This paper present the research of case studies assessed the environmental impact of construction sites using the Brazilian AQUA regulation. The research method included case studies in four companies of the construction industry, two located in the city of Recife and the other two in the city of São Paulo in Brazil, in order to verify the actions taken to improve the sustainability of the construction sites, from which it was possible to describe the key elements needed for establishing the AQUA regulation. Companies based in Recife responded positively to only 59 of 114 questions about taking action for sustainability in construction sites, representing 52 % positive answers, while São Paulo companies answered positively to 94 questions, or 83 % of positive answers. It is therefore expected to contribute to achieving a construction site with less impact on the environment, according to the scope of a Brazilian regulation with emphasis on how much we have to advance in terms of sustainability...|$|E
40|$|Costa Rica’s Certification for Sustainable Tourism (CST) is {{a program}} {{designed}} to encourage the Costa Rican hotel industry to implement sustainable practices that maintain the country’s image as a world leader of nature-based, conservation-based tourism. This study investigated {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the CST to gauge the reliability of the acclaimed program. Conducting extensive background research, reviewing previous literature, performing a case study and comparing the CST to two other distinctive programs helped to determine what factors contribute to and hinder the program’s reliability. In the case study, stream quality data suggested black-water pollution of the Quebrada Sin Nombre (“No Name Stream”) by El Establo Mountain Resort, a certified sustainable hotel in Monteverde, Costa Rica. This research helped to determine that there are several inadequacies that the program must address in order to ensure its credibility and create a <b>certification</b> <b>seal</b> that consumers can trust. Analysis showed that while the CST provides adequate consumer access to online information, it has failed to update this information and the program’s criteria to reflect improved technology and improved knowledge regarding sustainability. While the program is credible in that it requires third party verification, it fails to frequently audit hotels to verify compliance. In addition, while the program integrates a well tiered, five-level system, the minimum required compliance for certification sets the bar too low. Little quantifiable evidence was found regarding the CST’s ability to promote sustainable change. As a result, seven recommendations were produced for the CST to use as a platform to ensure its credibility and its ability to produce sustainable outputs: (1) Expanding financing options, (2) Increasing the baseline for certification membership, (3) Implementing standards that measure the hotel’s impacts, (4) Creating a more stringent auditing process, (5) Improving and marketing the certification’s nomenclature, (6) Publicizing information, enabling consumer input and increasing market demand and (7) Incentivizing hotels. Costa Rica represents only 0. 01 percent of the Earth’s surface while harboring more than five percent of the world’s biodiversity; therefore, successfully implementing a sustainable tourism scheme in Costa Rica can have global impacts...|$|E

To obtain these results we use a checklist, where we tabbed information gathered from field as the main contributions for the elaboration which plan of action to implement. The sample was formed by 80 farmers in the following groups: 35 coffee growers between the ages of 22 and 35 years, 28 farmers between the ages of 38 to 55 and 17 farmers between 57 and 65 years old. The results show that 20 farmers met with the basics needed to implement, required by the standard, in order to achieve certification of the seal. Major weaknesses were found when it came to environmental aspects, such as: wastewater management, integrated management of solid waste, proper handling of agrochemicals, but found great strengths when it came to the social aspects, such as: solidarity, teamwork, family formation and practice of values of coexistence. Highlighting the social strength aspect that these groups or producers live in such harmony with each other and their families would ease the success in the implementation and execution of the necessary corrective environmental procedures.
