50|$|<b>Clopamide</b> (trade name Brinaldix) is a {{piperidine}} diuretic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clopamide</b> is {{categorised}} as a thiazide-like diuretic {{and works}} in similar way as the thiazide diuretics do. It acts in the kidneys, at the distal convoluted tubule (PCT) of the nephron where it inhibits the sodium-chloride symporter. <b>Clopamide</b> selectively binds at the chloride binding site of the sodium-chloride symporter in the PCT cells on the luminal (interior) side and thus interferes with the reabsorption of sodium chloride, causing an equiosmolar excretion of water along with sodium chloride.|$|E
40|$|A multiclinical {{cooperative}} {{clinical trial}} at three university clinics in Tokyo is described. The three components of an anti-hypertensive combination have been compared with placebo in double blind fashion alone {{and in the}} possible combinations. The drug consists of: Dihydroergocristine 0 - 5 mg <b>Clopamide</b> 5 m...|$|E
40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is a {{life threatening}} disease and scientists are {{doing their best to}} find a cost effective and permanent treatment of this malady. The recent trend is to control the disease by target base inhibiting of enzymes or proteins. Secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP 4) is found to cause five times more risk of diabetes when expressed above average levels. This study was therefore designed to analyze the SFRP 4 and to find its potential inhibitors. SFRP 4 was analyzed by bio-informatics tools of sequence tool and structure tool. A total of three potential inhibitors of SFRP 4 were found, namely cyclothiazide, <b>clopamide</b> and perindopril. These inhibitors showed significant interactions with SFRP 4 as compared to other inhibitors as well as control (acetohexamide). The findings suggest the possible treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 by inhibiting the SFRP 4 using the inhibitors cyclothiazide, <b>clopamide</b> and perindopril...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of number of tablets for patient compliance {{was investigated in}} 160 patients with mild-moderate essential hypertension treated with a beta-adrenoceptor blocker and a thiazide diuretic. Mean BP at entry 146 +/- 16 / 92 +/- 8 mm Hg. All patients were given pindolol 10 mg and <b>clopamide</b> 5 mg in one combination tablet or in separate tablets for 4 months respectively. Approximately 90 % of the patients took greater than 90 % of the prescribed dose throughout the study. Mean BP decreased progressively and heart rate increased slightly. Side effects were more frequently reported during {{the first month of}} the study than previously, and 30 patients discontinued the treatment. No differences in this respect were seen between 1 and 2 tablets daily. Approximately 75 % of the patients preferred 1 tablet daily, but combining two drugs in one tablet had no effect upon compliance...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{activators}} are agrochemicals that {{activate the}} plant immune system, thereby enhancing disease resistance. Due to their prophylactic and durable effects {{on a wide}} spectrum of diseases, plant activators can provide synergistic crop protection when used in combination with traditional pest controls. Although plant activators have achieved great success in wet-rice farming practices in Asia, their use is still limited. To isolate novel plant activators applicable to other crops, we screened a chemical library using a method that can selectively identify immune-priming compounds. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of three diuretics, bumetanide, bendroflumethiazide and <b>clopamide,</b> as immune-priming compounds. These drugs upregulate the immunity-related cell death of Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells induced with an avirulent strain of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato in a concentration-dependent manner. The application of these compounds to Arabidopsis plants confers disease resistance to not only the avirulent but also a virulent strain of the pathogen. Unlike salicylic acid, an endogenous phytohormone that governs disease resistance in response to biotrophic pathogens, the three diuretic compounds analyzed here do not induce PR 1 or inhibit plant growth, showing potential a...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} procedure {{was developed for}} the fast screening of 16 diuretics (acetazolamide, althiazide, amiloride, bendroflumethiazide, bumetanide, canrenoic acid, chlorthalidone, chlorthiazide, <b>clopamide,</b> ethacrynic acid, furosemide, hydrochlorthiazide, hydroflumethiazide, indapamide, triamterene, trichlormethiazide) and a masking agent (probenecid) in human urine. The whole method involves three analytical steps, including (1) liquid/liquid extraction of the analytes from the matrix, (2) their reaction with methyl iodide at 70 â—¦C for 2 h to form methyl derivatives, (3) analysis of the resulting mixture by fast gas chromatography/electron impact mass spectrometry (fast GC/EI-MS). The analytical method was validated by determining selectivity, linearity, accuracy, intra and inter assay precision, extraction efficiencies and {{signal to noise ratio}} (S/N) at the lowest calibration level (LCL) for all candidate analytes. The analytical performances of three extraction procedures and five combination of derivatization parameters were compared in order to probe the conditions for speeding up the sample preparation step. Limits of detection (LOD) were evaluated in both EI-MS and ECNI-MS (electron capture negative ionization mass spectrometry) modes, indicating better sensitivity for most of the analytes using the latter ionization technique. The use of short columns and high carrier gas velocity in fast GC/MS produced efficient separation of the analytes in less than 4 min, resulting in a drastic reduction of the analysis time, while a resolution comparable to that obtained from classic GC conditions is maintained. Fast quadrupole MS electronics allows high scan rates and effective data acquisition both in scan and selected ion monitoring mode...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a rapid and efficient Capillary Zone Electrophoresis (CZE) method for Quality Control analysis of pharmaceutical preparations containing antihistamines, decongestants, anticholinergic remedies and preservatives. Active ingredients of interest are: ChlorPheniramine Maleate (CPM), DiPhenhydramine Hydrochloride (DPH), Ephedrine hydrochloride (E), Isopropamide Iodide (II), Pheniramine Maleate (PM), Lidocaine hydrochloride (L), Tetracaine hydrochloride (T), <b>Clopamide</b> Hydrochloride (CH), DiHydroErgochristine (DHE), PhenylEphrine hy drochloride (PE) and Acetaminophen (A). Preservatives studied are: MethylParaben (MeP), EthylParaben (EtP), Pro pylParaben (PrP), ButylParaben (BuP), p -HydroxyBenzoic Acid (p- HBA). All these analytes were separated in a single run using 60 mM tetraborate buffer solution (TBS) pH = 9. 2 as a BackGround Electrolyte (BGE) by using an uncoated fused silica capillary of I. D. = 50 m m and applying a voltage of 25 kV {{in the first part of}} the electropheretic run (up to 5. 8 min) and 30 kV for the remaining time. The hydrodynamic pressurization of the inlet vial was 20 psi at 7. 2 min. up to the end of analysis. Total separation time was of 7. 5 min. The method was then successfully validated and applied to the simultaneous determination of active ingredients and preservatives. Good repeatability, linearity, and sensitivity were demonstrated. Precision of migration time (t m) was RSD% c) was RSD% 2 1. 000. LOD and LOQ, accuracy (recovery) and ruggedness were evaluated for each analyte demonstrating the good reliability of the method. Analyses of some pharmaceutical real samples were performed. </p...|$|E
