The equity crisis made people feel poor and metastasized into a <b>consumption</b> <b>crisis,</b> which is why purchases of cars, appliances, electronics, homes and clothing have just fallen off a cliff. This, in turn, has sparked more company defaults, exacerbated the credit crisis and metastasized into an unemployment crisis, as companies rush to shed workers.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the welfare costs of {{exposure}} to shocks linked to trade openness, {{an issue that is}} of main interest for international economic policy. It addresses the question as to whether the current process of trade liberalisation has a net destabilising effect on partner countries, increasing their vulnerability. Starting from a broader definition of vulnerability than simply vulnerability to poverty because of trade openness, this paper highlights, presenting both probit and 3 SLS estimates, a robust and significant long term relationship (1960 - 2007), in a large sample of countries, between the “extreme volatility ” of <b>consumption</b> (<b>crisis</b> and boom) - induced by trade openness- and the deviation of consumption growth from its expected path. The novelty of this paper lies in its ability to match two strands of the literature (volatility and vulnerability). It improves the existing literature on aggregate volatility by adding a forward looking lens; a feasible notion of benchmark and a counterfactual, all essential elements of a vulnerability framework...|$|E
40|$|After a short {{discussion}} of Mises ’ view on money, which {{sheds light on}} a purely statistical version of the business cycle, the article focuses on how the introduction of fiduciary money affects economic behaviour within the Austrian context. In particular, it is emphasised that the early-Austrian boom is actually a situation where production is not rising. It turns into a crash when fiduciary money is rejected and reverse seigniorage goes off. However, and in partial contrast with the original theory, it is also shown that the crisis hits the banking system, rather than the producers. If so, it follows that when fiduciary money is no longer accepted {{as a means of}} payment, the business cycle leads to redistribution, rather than to a dramatic fall in production. Furthermore, since within the Austrian context consumers are induced to anticipate <b>consumption,</b> <b>crisis</b> is not ignited by inflationary panic, but by the fact that after a while consumers become aware of the inconsistency of their inter-temporal choice. At that moment, the conditions that allowed production to expand are no longer sustainable. The consequences of this change are then examined in detail and become the core of the Austrian end of the boom. The final sections of the paper formulate an extended version of the Austrian business cycle and draw some conclusions as regards both the dynamics of recession and selected policy issues...|$|E

Therefore, the wine sector represents a key factor for attracting tourism, due to a wine tourism phenomenon which involves both a niche of experts persons and tourists in general. Our research goals are twofold. The first is to examine the impact of wine consumption trend on Italian and foreign wine companies in terms of economic performance. The second goal is to identify the most relevant green concepts for the wine industry with regard to addressing environmental challenges. We formulated two research hypotheses correlated to the above goals. The objective of the research was identified through an analysis of the national and international literature on the research topic. In addition, a quantitative and qualitative survey was conducted in order to achieved to research objectives. It emerged that Italian wine consumption trend negatively impacted on core business performance, while not on the return on equity; despite the world <b>consumption</b> <b>crisis,</b> global wine consumption is kept to a similar extent in pre-crisis period and foreign companies in the sample have obtained an increase in economic performance. In addition, the tendency towards a green economy is also involving the wine sector, due to companies??? susceptibility to a greater focus on the environment. The implications of this study are related to the potential of the wine sector in Italy and in other foreign countries. This sector represents an interesting field of action for related companies in terms of turnover and profitability. In order to overcome the limitations of the present research, it would be interesting to compare the potential and dynamics of wine consumption on performance with that of other economic sectors, which are also representative of a country economy. Furthermore, some suitable econometric models would be usefull to carry out a simulation on the impact of a series of external and internal variables of the wine market on the performance...|$|E

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia and episodic vaso-occlusive pain crises. Vaso-occlusion occurs when deoxygenated hemoglobin S polymerizes and erythrocytes sickle and adhere in the microvasculature, a process dependent on the concentration of hemoglobin S {{and the rate of}} deoxygenation, among other factors. We measured oxygen consump-tion in the thenar eminence during brachial artery occlusion in sickle cell patients and healthy individuals. Microvascular oxygen consumption was greater in sickle cell patients than in healthy individuals (median [interquartile range]; sickle cell: 0. 91 [0. 75 - 1. 07] vs healthy: 0. 75 [0. 62 - 0. 94] 2 DHbO 2 /min, P <. 05) and was elevated further during acute pain crisis (crisis: 1. 10 [0. 78 - 1. 30] vs recovered: 0. 88 [0. 76 - 1. 03] 2 DHbO 2 /min, P <. 05).

Unsustainable bushmeat hunting is a major threat to wildlife and its consumption is associated with an increased risk of acquiring zoonotic diseases, such as Ebola virus disease (EVD). During the recent EVD outbreak in West Africa, it is likely that human dietary behavior and local attitudes toward bushmeat consumption changed in response to the crisis, and that the rate of change depended on prevailing socio-economic conditions, including wealth and education. In this study, we therefore investigated the effects of income, education, and literacy on changes in bushmeat <b>consumption</b> during the <b>crisis,</b> as well as complementary changes in daily meal frequency, food diversity and bushmeat preference. More specifically, we tested whether wealthier households with more educated household heads decreased their consumption of bushmeat during the EVD crisis, and whether their daily meal frequency and food diversity remained constant. We used Generalized Linear Mixed Models to analyze interview data from two nationwide household surveys across Liberia. We found an overall decrease in bushmeat <b>consumption</b> during the <b>crisis</b> across all income levels. However, the rate of bushmeat consumption in high-income households decreased less than in low-income households. Daily meal frequency decreased during the crisis, and the diversity of food items and preferences for bushmeat species remained constant.

Extant reconciliations of these patterns in the popular press rely on ad hoc reasoning. Using historical data on currency crisis episodes across the world, we show that the impact of the crisis on a firm's business is best understood by focusing on the impact of the crisis on the behavior of consumers. Our analyses show that consumer behavior in a crisis is characterized by consumption smoothing at various levels [...] intertemporal, intercategory, and intracategory. These behavioral adjustments result in significant reallocation of consumption expenditures. More importantly, the smoothing decisions because of a crisis are distinct and independent of the impact of changes in income and prices that accompany a crisis. Interestingly, there is marked variation in the patterns of consumption smoothing across different types of economies. Taken together, these results have important and interesting implications for managers, policy makers, and academics. consumer behavior, <b>consumption</b> smoothing, <b>crisis,</b> econometrics, marketing strategy...|$|R

40|$|Emerging market {{financial}} crises are abrupt and dramatic, usually occurring {{after a period}} of high output growth, massive capital flows, and a boom in asset markets. This paper develops an equilibrium asset pricing model with informational frictions in which vulnerability and the crisis itself are consequences of the investor optimism in the period preceding the crisis. The model features two sets of investors, domestic and foreign. Both sets of investors are imperfectly informed about the true state of the emerging economy. Investors learn from noisy signals which contain information relevant for asset returns and formulate expectations, or ``beliefs'', about the state of productivity. Numerical analysis shows that, if preceded by a sequence of positive signals, a small, negative noise shock can trigger a sharp downward adjustment in investors' beliefs, asset prices, and consumption. The magnitude of this downward adjustment and sensitivity to negative signals increase with the level of optimism attained prior to the negative signal. Moreover, with the introduction of informational frictions, asset prices display persistent effects in response to transitory shocks, and the volatility of <b>consumption</b> increasesfinancial <b>crises,</b> emerging markets, informational frictions, learning...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Since {{the onset}} of the {{financial}} <b>crisis,</b> income and <b>consumption</b> have fallen sharply in Ireland, particularly for young households. This paper shows that young households are more likely than older ones to be exposed to unemployment, arrears and negative equity. These may give rise to credit constraints and buffer-stock savings. Savings may be built up not only to finance future consumption, but also to deleverage, since high indebtedness makes the access to additional credit more difficult. We show that the permanent income hypothesis, which posits that consumption should evolve more smoothly than actual income, apparently fails to hold for households in negative equity, at risk thereof and at risk of unemployment. This may have caused much of the decline in aggregate <b>consumption</b> during the <b>crisis...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A dynamic {{consumption}} function, where {{consumption in}} the long run is determined by households’ disposable income and wealth, has been superior to the Euler equation in explaining the development of Norwegian aggregate consumption over several decades. This period covers the years of financial deregulation in the mid 1980 s, the banking crisis around 1990 following the deregulation and the current international financial crisis. In the current version, long run consumption is homogeneous in income and wealth and there is also a significant effect from after-tax real interest rates. A change in the correlation pattern between real interest rates and wealth, which is related to a change in the monetary policy regime, is the reason why both variables need to be included {{in the long run}} relationship in order to explain the development over the past four years.
