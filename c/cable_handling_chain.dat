These cables are manually lifted {{and attached to}} the mine roof to prevent damage from mobile underground equipment.

40|$|In {{response}} {{to the establishment of}} the East Gippsland Vegetable Industry Board, a major new initiative in fresh vegetable production, marketing and a research program was initiated. It was to examine a number of factors highlighted by the Boston Consulting Group that were inhibiting the industry from becoming world competitive. These factors included the size of individual production units, transport and handling procedures, postharvest care, yield and a poor understanding of the <b>handling</b> <b>chain</b> and market intelligence (Boston Consulting Group, 1992 c). As part of the research program, this study was initiated to analyse the <b>handling</b> <b>chain</b> for fresh horticultural produce. Its purpose was to provide a detailed understanding of the conditions affecting the development of a quality management program. As will be seen in the following literature review, well controlled and operated <b>handling</b> <b>chains</b> are difficult to establish in Australia. Therefore, it is important that this aspect of horticulture be thoroughly understood {{so that it can be}} operated efficiently. Such a requirement is rendered more important when it is considered that East Gippsland is at least 300 km from any major port or distribution centre. This report through the use of a range of methods (i. e. pilot study, survey and case study) puts forward the thesis that for the long term sustainability of the fresh produce industry in Australia, it is necessary that procedures be established to enable market signals to be better disseminated to all players along the <b>handling</b> <b>chain.</b> This lack of information flow makes it difficult for suppliers to ensure that the product consistently satisfies consumer requirements. Other problems related to material handling, transport efficiency, storage facilities, training needs and quality control procedures are related to the fragmented nature of the industry. The survey showed a correlation between how well a producer understood the complexity of the <b>handling</b> <b>chain</b> and how he resolved other quality related problems. In overcoming this central issue, three case studies were undertaken to define different kinds of solutions. While this study makes a number of recommendations, the real challenge for operators in this industry is to put into place as quickly as possible a series of actions that will integrate customers needs into the whole production-distribution-supply system. This suggests the need for a more coordinated approach to quality management such as TQM (Total Quality Management). To be successful in implementing such a program in this industry frequent communication and co-operation within the whole <b>handling</b> <b>chain</b> would be needed. In order to achieve the desired industry commitment to quality, there are four major which need to be addressed when implementing TQM: (a) Importance of regular timely customer feedback (b) Formalisation of handling procedures for the entire <b>handling</b> <b>chain</b> (c) Importance of education and training (d) Avoid the confusing aspects of Quality Assurance (QA) and Total Quality Management (TQM) in quality management...|$|R

On top of this, postharvest research is dealing with large sources of biological variation. This paper outlines a general model approach of how {{to account for the}} propagation of biological variation when analysing experimental postharvest data gathered at dynamic {{temperature conditions}}. The proposed technique was applied to experimental data on colour change of tomatoes cv. 'Tradiro'. The previously developed multivariate stochastic approach was combined with a transformation of real time into physiological time to account for the effect of dynamic temperature conditions. The developed model has the capability to describe the complex batch behaviour showing propagation of biological variation in tomato colour as a function of time and dynamically changing temperature during postharvest storage. This makes the current approach extremely suitable for application in real life situations when evaluating and optimising a logistic <b>handling</b> <b>chain.</b> (C) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|AbstractThe thesis in hand has {{investigated}} {{the feasibility of}} a cable electric ferry concept. The concept investigated is based on that a short route ferry receives its propulsive power through a cable connected to the land power grid. Four cable transfer configurations and associated equipment have been looked upon. The cable can either be stretched in the air over the route, it can float after the ferry, it can be towed submerged after the ferry, or it can follow the bottom contours after the ferry. The three latter configurations required storage and <b>cable</b> <b>handling</b> equipment, which can either be located onboard the ferry or on shore. The cable is reeled out under transit and spooled in on the way back. The air stretched configuration requires an arm type connection between the ferry and the cable {{in order to receive}} power. Current available technology has been assessed for concept realization in terms of <b>cable</b> and <b>handling</b> equipment. In addition, regulations for power onboard and emergency power systems are viewed upon, as well as regulations on emissions to air. Competing and alternative power systems to the concept have also been assessed. Lastly, a case study for concept implementation has been conducted. Findings made in the thesis include that current cable material composition and layer configurations will need engineering in terms of increasing strength, and reducing weight and dimension without influencing conductivity. Current <b>cable</b> <b>handling</b> equipment used in offshore cable laying vessels have good tension specifications for the concept, but compared to alternative power sources such as diesel- and LNG-gensets they have large weights and dimensions, and their operational handling speed is low for high tension levels. This gives that current technology would need development for concept realization. Weights and dimensions must be reduced, and handling speed must be increased such that the ferry is able to operate in normal transit with speed and payload. Further, the concept has also been economically compared with alternative power sources. With current technology the concept costs exceed the cost of competing alternatives, where the most expensive concept component is the cable. The cable cost exceeds the cost of a new LNG-genset. <b>Cable</b> <b>handling</b> equipment costs are relatively low compared to the cable. As for operational costs, electricity is found comparable with current LNG prices. But for maintenance costs, the concept is far more expensive than for instance a LNG-genset, because the cable will have relatively low operational lifecycle due to wear and fatigue, and will have to be replaced a lot sooner than gensets. And a genset can increase operational lifecycle by being overhauled, where pistons, bearings and seals are replaced. The concept is found physically feasible, but to meet the specification requirements equipment and components will need engineering and analyses. Economically, the concept is rather insufficient, but future local emission regulations and fuel costs may make the concept achievable. </p...|$|R

40|$|Conductive cables {{have always}} {{represented}} {{a source of}} noise in ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data. In some instances, commercially available GPR systems use data processing tools to reduce cable noise. Such processes seldom respect the amplitude fidelity of the signal. For the purpose of careful, quantitative amplitude measurements, use of the raw recorded data is a critical starting point for reliable interpretation of results. During subsequent processing, users can compensate for cable effects to varying degrees. To illustrate the issues inherent with cable noise, we show an example where cable movement during data acquisition generates deviations in reflection amplitude up to 19 %. We then present the ramifications of these variations for quantitative data analysis. We conclude that precise <b>cable</b> <b>handling</b> can improve data quality and subsequent data interpretation. Our results are particularly pertinent for quantitative analysis and inversion of GPR data where precise amplitude information is crucial...|$|R
