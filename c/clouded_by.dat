5|$|The {{casualties}} {{suffered by}} the two combatants are difficult to determine, due to several factors. In regard to the Germans, equipment losses were {{complicated by the fact}} that they made determined efforts to recover and repair tanks. For example, tanks disabled one day often appeared a day or two later repaired. German personnel losses are <b>clouded</b> <b>by</b> the lack of access to German unit records, which were seized at the end of the war. Many were transferred to the United States national archives and were not made available until 1978, while others were taken by the Soviet Union, which declined to confirm their existence.|$|E
5|$|In September 1792 Heywood was court-martialed {{and with}} five others {{was sentenced to}} hang. However, the court {{recommended}} mercy for Heywood, and King George III pardoned him. In a rapid change of fortune he found himself favoured by senior officers, and after the resumption of his career received a series of promotions that gave him his first command {{at the age of}} 27 and made him a post-captain at 31. He remained in the navy until 1816, building a respectable career as a hydrographer, and then enjoyed a long and peaceful retirement. The extent of Heywood's true guilt in the mutiny has been <b>clouded</b> <b>by</b> contradictory statements and possible false testimony. During his trial powerful family connections worked on his behalf, and he later benefited from the Christian family's generally fruitful efforts to demean Bligh's character and present the mutiny as an understandable reaction to an unbearable tyranny. Contemporary press reports, and more recent commentators, have contrasted Heywood's pardon with the fate of his fellow prisoners who were hanged, all lower-deck sailors without wealth or family influence.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November, {{assistant}} manager Matthew Gill left the club by mutual consent. Rovers defeated Bristol Rovers in the First Round of FA Cup {{thanks to a}} Max Power goal on 54th minute. Three days later Tranmere upheld their good cup form in the Football League Trophy with an away victory at Bury. After narrow defeats against Luton Town and Southend United, Tranmere finally achieved their first league victory under Micky Adams on 29 November against Portsmouth. The win was <b>clouded</b> <b>by</b> the serious injury of young loanee Will Aimson, who fractured both his tibia and fibula in a collision with teammate Danny Holmes. 17-year old defender Evan Gumbs made his first appearance for the senior team against Luton Town as a second-half substitute, following an injury to Josh Thompson who picked up a hamstring injury on his Tranmere debut.|$|E

25|$|The {{contention}} surrounding romanizations {{has never}} been purely academic or {{in response to the}} needs of the foreign community in Taiwan, but rather <b>clouded</b> <b>by</b> partisan politics. As a result, romanization of Mandarin in Taiwan in the 20th century was generally inconsistent and quite difficult for everyone—be they tourists, foreign-born residents or native-born Taiwanese—to interpret. Since most Taiwanese were taught only Zhuyin/Bopomofo to write phonetic inscriptions of Chinese words, rather than a romanization system, there is little incentive to standardize romanization.|$|E
25|$|She {{was above}} the {{ordinary}} height in stature, weighed about 130 pounds, was slenderly built, and had much the appearance of one inclined to consumption. Her skin was dark; hair dark brown; eyes gray and small; forehead prominent; face sharp and angular, with a marked expression for melancholy which fixed itself {{in the memory of}} all who ever saw or knew her.

The area midway between the front and back legs is marked by a large patch of dark umber-brown, which fades into the buffy surrounding parts. A small spot occurs over each eye, with a narrow band behind the black mask. The sides of the head and the ears are dirty-white in color.|$|E

His presence at Paris was instantly demanded. The Vidame was desolated, but his absence could not be for more than five days. Bradshaw was hunted for, and found: the 9.50 train was opportune.

25|$|In {{his first}} decade in Nyasaland after {{returning}} from Lynchburg, Virginia, Chilembwe had reasonable success. After 1910 his mission faced rising debt as support from its American backers dried up. His personal life was <b>clouded</b> <b>by</b> {{the death of a}} daughter, his asthma attacks and his declining eyesight and general health. These problems increased Chilembwe's bitterness toward Europeans in Nyasaland, and moved him towards thoughts of revolt. However, the outbreak and effects of the First World War was the key factor in moving him from merely thinking to planning action, which he believed would lead to the deliverance of the African people of Nyasaland.|$|E
25|$|In Robson's {{first full}} season, Porto claimed the 1994–95 Primeira Divisão title {{with a win}} at Sporting CP's ground and played Benfica four times to secure both the 1993 and 1994 stagings of the Supertaça. The {{beginning}} of the season had been <b>clouded</b> <b>by</b> the death of 26-year-old midfielder Rui Filipe, who had scored the club's first league goal. Robson's increasing health problems barred him from leading Porto in the first months of the 1995–96 season, but he returned in time to revalidate the league title. Striker Domingos Paciência became the club's top goalscorer for the second consecutive time and won that season's Bola de Prata, the last win by a Portuguese player.|$|E
25|$|On February 28, 1995, Ernesto Zedillo 90-day-old {{administration}} {{ignited a}} tremendous political crisis versus Carlos Salinas; for this, he staged a brief hunger strike {{to protest the}} arrest of his older brother Raúl Salinas de Gortari (see below) {{as well as the}} accusations of responsibility for the country's economic travails that his successor as President, Ernesto Zedillo, aimed at him. He abandoned his campaign, which had been backed by the United States, to become the Director-General of the World Trade Organization. He left Mexico for self-imposed exile and settled in Ireland. Beyond the disputes over responsibility for Mexico's economic problems, Salinas's reputation was to be further <b>clouded</b> <b>by</b> a series of controversies involving close family members.|$|E
25|$|This {{model has}} been well-supported so far by the {{distribution}} of short GRB host galaxies, which have been observed in old galaxies with no star formation (for example, GRB050509B, the first short burst to be localized to a probable host) {{as well as in}} galaxies with star formation still occurring (such as GRB050709, the second), as even younger-looking galaxies can have significant populations of old stars. However, the picture is <b>clouded</b> somewhat <b>by</b> the observation of X-ray flaring in short GRBs out to very late times (up to many days), long after the merger should have been completed, and the failure to find nearby hosts of any sort for some short GRBs.|$|R
50|$|The {{memory of}} Ludovico was <b>clouded</b> for centuries <b>by</b> Niccolò Machiavelli’s {{accusation}} that he “invited” Charles VIII to invade Italy, {{paving the way}} for subsequent foreign domination.

More recent historians, however, placing the figure of Ludovico in its Renaissance setting, have reevaluated his merits as a ruler and given a more equitable assessment of his achievement.|$|R
50|$|Cacciatore's dynamic {{record was}} <b>clouded,</b> however, <b>by</b> the dictatorship's own Dirty War against dissidents and its {{resulting}} 30,000 deaths and disappearances (most {{of which were}} known by the regime to be non-violent dissidents, and for which 15 detention centers were opened in Buenos Aires, alone), and by financial irregularities in the mayor's many projects, themselves. The two completed freeways, budgeted at US$222 million, cost nearly a billion dollars, and their less-than-projected use by toll-paying motorists helped lead to the suspension of work on the other five in 1981; one planned freeway was cancelled only after the demolition of a several block-long swath in a residential area, {{and its effects on}} the residential Saavedra neighborhood were only remedied in the late 1990s (three other freeways were ultimately completed).|$|R
