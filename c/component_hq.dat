2500|$|The 51st (Highland) Division HQ {{requested}} {{air support}} from the South <b>Component</b> <b>HQ</b> at Boos but the three AASF fighter squadrons were down to [...] aircraft and lost another four during the morning. Big Luftwaffe attacks had been expected on the industrial town of Rouen, a rail and road centre and Anglo-French base of operations; 1 Squadron and French fighters intercepted a raid {{early in the morning}} and shot down several aircraft but the remainder got through and bombed Boos aerodrome and an army camp. Another raid in the evening was caught by 501 Squadron but managed to bomb the airfield and camp again, the main bridge, power station, railway and factories. Bombing by the AASF and Bomber Command took place further east and during the night, [...] attacked German communications in France and oil and transport targets in Germany.|$|E

2500|$|In general, U.S. Unified Combatant Commands have an HQ {{of their}} own in one location, {{subordinate}} service <b>component</b> <b>HQs,</b> sometimes one or two co-located with the main HQ or sometimes spread widely, and {{a wide range of}} operating locations, main bases, forward detachments, etc. USAFRICOM initially appears to be considering something slightly different; spreading the actually COCOM HQ over several locations, rather than having the COCOM HQ in one place and the putative [...] "U.S. Army Forces, Africa", its air component, and [...] "U.S. Naval Forces, Africa" [...] in one to four separate locations. AFRICOM will not have the traditional J-type staff divisions, instead having outreach, plans and programs, knowledge development, operations and logistics, and resources branches. [...] AFRICOM went back to a traditional J-Staff in early 2011 after General Carter Ham took command.|$|R
50|$|JFCC IMD {{originated}} in the Implemented Directive issued by the Commander, United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) in January 2005. The JFCCs were formed to further operationalize USSTRATCOM missions and allow the Headquarters, USSTRATCOM to focus on strategic-level integration and advocacy. JFCC IMD is responsible for planning and coordinating global operations and support for integrated missile defense. The JFCC IMD will conduct operational and tactical level planning and day-to-day employment of assigned and attached missile defense forces for USSTRATCOM integrated missile defense operations, to include integrated missile defense planning and operational support responsibilities with other combatant commands, the Missile Defense Agency and joint service <b>components.</b> <b>HQ</b> USSTRATCOM will retain the responsibility for advocacy of system-level missile defense capabilities, integration of missile defense into strategic level planning and military assessments of missile defense capabilities. Strategic Level Intelligence support will be provided by Defense Intelligence Agency’s Joint Intelligence Operations Center.|$|R
50|$|Also {{resident}} {{within the}} headquarters are the Maritime Component Commander, the Land Component Commander (New Zealand), and the Air Component Commander. Air <b>Component</b> Commanders at <b>HQ</b> JFNZ have included Air Commodores Steve Moore (until 2013) and Kevin McEvoy (2013-).|$|R
50|$|The command was {{established}} as Joint Command Southwest on 30 September 1999. It was subsequently renamed Land <b>Component</b> Command <b>HQ</b> Madrid (CC-LAND HQ MD) {{and had a}} staff of 450 soldiers from 16 countries {{who took part in}} land operations in the Balkans, Afghanistan and Kosovo. In 2005 it assisted the African Union by training its troops. The last commander, General Cardona Torres, was a Spanish Army officer who took over the command in 2010. In 2010 it adopted the name Allied Force Command Madrid.|$|R
50|$|H.Q. British Forces, Aden was {{a command}} of the Royal Air Force (RAF) {{established}} on 14 April 1942 by renaming the Aden Command. The <b>components</b> of <b>H.Q.</b> British Forces, Aden are indicated below for two dates during World War II. H.Q. British Forces Aden primarily conducted antisubmarine warfare operations and escort missions as a sub-command of RAF Middle East Command, which itself was a sub-command of Mediterranean Air Command following a major reorganization of the Allied air forces in the North African and Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) in February 1943.|$|R
5000|$|Initially, the {{commander}} of [...] "Combined Task Force 635" [...] (CTF 635) - the military element of the Mission - was Lieutenant Colonel John Frewen, commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2 RAR), and the deputy commander Major Vern Bennett, New Zealand Army, from Linton. The Land <b>Component</b> included <b>HQ</b> 2 RAR from Townsville, 200 Australian infantry from 2 RAR, a Fijian rifle company, probably from 3 Fiji Infantry Regiment, Queen Elizabeth Bks, Suva, and a Pacific Islands Company, under an Australian Company commander, with Tongan, PNG, and Australian rifle platoons. Supporting elements included a PNG engineer troop, New Zealand engineer and medical elements, an Australian Combat Service Support Team, with some personnel from Army level troops from Sydney plus logistics personnel from New Zealand, and four Australian Project Nervana Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for surveillance.|$|R
30|$|Recent {{pharmacological}} and {{toxicological studies}} indicated that water-soluble <b>components</b> of <b>HQ</b> extract exhibit {{a variety of}} therapeutically useful activities with relatively low toxicity (Yimam et al. 2010), whereas long-term toxicity (e.g. damage to the bile duct) of extracts prepared using organic solvent has been reported (Ong et al. 2004) although herbal extraction using organic solvent (e.g. UE-E in this study which possesses a significant herb–drug interaction with CYP 3 A 4 -metabolized drugs) is not a common practice for human consumption. Taken together, our results illustrate that MAE-W provided an effective and efficient procedure {{in terms of a}} higher yield of crude extract collected than the conventional HRE-W, and more importantly HQ extract prepared by this procedure has similar pharmacological activities with a lesser magnitude of herb–drug interactions when compared with extracts prepared using other organic-solvent extraction methods. It remains to be determined whether this favorable cost-efficient extraction method could be used in preparation of extracts of more expensive Chinese herb such as Cordyceps for therapeutic uses without affecting their pharmacological effects.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we present multi-waveband imaging {{polarimetry}} and spectropolarime- try of the starburst galaxy M 82 and multi-waveband imaging polarimetry {{of the active}} galaxy NGC 5128. A review of previous studies of these galaxies is given. The imaging polarimetry of M 82 in broadband filters reveals a polarization pattern that is due to scattering {{of light from the}} galactic disk and a nuclear starburst <b>component.</b> The <b>Hq</b> filter polarimetry shows a centrosymmetric pattern from the nuclear component only. The spectropolarimetry of the southern filaments of M 82 shows evidence for a mixture of scattering and intrinsic emission from the walls of a superwind blown cavity. Only the Hɑ systemic component of M 82 is seen in polarized intensity, the blueshifted component is due to intrinsic emission only. NGC 5128 displays a polarization pattern in its dust lane which is produced by extinction due to aligned non-spherical dust grains in a magnetic field. The wavelength dependence of the polarization in the dust lane is found to follow a Serkowski curve in the central regions...|$|R
25|$|When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, 50th Divisional RE was {{reformed}} as 103 Field Engineer Regiment, RE, with 232, 235 and 506 {{companies now}} designated as squadrons. When the division was reorganised as a division/district command in 1961, 103 Regiment was broken up, but 232 and 506 Field Squadrons and 235 Field Park Squadron {{continued to be}} assigned to the divisional HQ. A major reorganisation in 1967 saw the division/district disbanded, and its RE <b>component</b> reformed as <b>HQ</b> Squadron and 103 Field Squadron of 72 Engineer Regiment. The remainder of 72 Engineer Regiment was formed by the lineal descendants of the Tyne Electrical Engineers, thus uniting the lineages of all the Newcastle and Durham Engineer Volunteers of 1860 and 1874).|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{scattering}} matrix results of Herschel Quincke (<b>HQ)</b> <b>components</b> waveguide resonators installed {{in combination with}} an acoustic liner (HQ-liners) are presented in this paper. This approach aims at controlling both tonal and broadband noise to improve the liner efficiency. It consists in installing circumferential arrays of Herschel-Quincke tubes on a main duct in a serial association with a locally reacting liner of known impedance. Results for the {{scattering matrix}} of this system are deduced from an analytical model and compared with experimental and numerical data showing a good agreement. Analysis of the scattering matrix coefficients points out the modal conversion properties dependence upon the number of HQ tubes along the circumference. Results of the transmission loss shows that to choose an optimal HQ configuration {{with respect to the}} liner properties leads to an important improvement of liner efficiency...|$|R
