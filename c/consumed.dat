5000|$|Lu's teachings do not {{prohibit}} {{the consumption of}} meat for the disciples. For the monks and nuns, alcohol consumption is prohibited, while meat requires bardo deliverance of the soul prior to consumption. In an interview from Taiwanese media in 2010, Grandmaster Lu explained: [...] "In tantric buddhism, we don't differentiate if a disciple wants to <b>consume</b> vegetables or meat. If a disciple wants to <b>consume</b> vegetables, we let her <b>consume</b> vegetables. If a disciple {{is not willing to}} <b>consume</b> meat, it is convenience. For those ordained (monks, nuns etc) if able to <b>consume</b> vegetables, then we always try our best to <b>consume</b> vegetables. If he cannot <b>consume</b> vegetables, it is also convenience. But this convenience is also different. Because there is a difference of theravada and tantric in Buddhism, tantric masters or monks firstly have to make offering of the food they <b>consume</b> to the buddhas and bodhisattvas. Secondly, they also have to salvage the spirits of those they <b>consume</b> and cleanse their spirits to pure lands or higher realms. So for tantric buddhism, there are ways to convert the spirits we <b>consume</b> to a better places or realms for their good before we <b>consume.</b> However, for theravada buddhism, they emphasize we do not <b>consume</b> meat. But for tantric, because we have a method of salvation, we are able to <b>consume</b> meat. The most important precept is we must not witness the slaughtering or hear the slaughtering or slaughter animals for our desire as a guest. According to Buddha, this is known as [...] "three cleansed meat" [...] or 3 types of cleansed meat." ...|$|R
