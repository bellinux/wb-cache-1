Scene changes back to Phelps’ office where, after a while of working on the document, Phelps rings the bell to summon commissionaire to get him a cup of coffee. The bell is answered {{by a woman who}} says he is the commissionaire’s wife. She leaves after saying she will wake the commissionaire to prepare the coffee. Phelps resumes working on the document but since the coffee does not arrive for a while, leaves his room, with the original and the half-finished copy on his desk, to go down and check on the commissionaire. He finds that the commissionaire had dozed off and while he is apologizing for that, to both their surprise, a bell rings in the commissionaire’s room. The commissionaire is confused as to the ringing of the bell and upon asking tells Phelps that that bell is from the room in which he was working. Phelps, realizing that the documents are lying unprotected on his desk, rushes up the stairs to his room and finds that the original document has disappeared from his desk.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{proposes to}} combine the IEEE 1588 {{protocol}} and the adaptive oscillator correction method (AOCM) to improve master-slave synchronization. This is done by extending the AOCM to a slave <b>clock</b> to <b>train</b> a model using the IEEE 1588 synchronization updates from a master clock. The model corrections are applied to the slave clock during the waiting period in between the synchronization updates and when the slave-master network experiences an outage. The NS- 2 {{results indicate that the}} slave accuracy improves up to 10 times for no traffic networks depending on the slave <b>clock</b> <b>training</b> period. In traffic scenarios, the slave accuracy is affected by the asymmetric delays such that the degree of accuracy is one half of the asymmetric latencies. During network congestion, the slave accuracy improves because the delays are less asymmetric. During an outage in a traffic scenario, the solution only improves the slave clock stability. iii Acknowledgements I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Thomas Kunz fo...|$|R
5000|$|In 1843 Matthäus Hipp first {{mentioned}} a purely mechanical clock {{being driven by}} a switch called [...] "echappement à palette". A varied version of that escapement has been used from the 1860s inside electrically driven pendulum clocks, the so-called [...] "hipp-toggle". Since the 1870s in an improved version the pendulum drove a ratchet wheel via a pawl on the pendulum rod, and the ratchet wheel drove {{the rest of the}} <b>clock</b> <b>train</b> to indicate the time. The pendulum was not impelled on every swing or even at a set interval of time. It was only impelled when its arc of swing had decayed below a certain level. As well as the counting pawl, the pendulum carried a small vane, known as a Hipp's toggle, pivoted at the top, which was completely free to swing. It was placed so that it dragged across a triangular polished block with a vee-groove in the top of it. When the arc of swing of the pendulum was large enough, the vane crossed the groove and swung free on the other side. If the arc was too small the vane never left {{the far side of the}} groove, and when the pendulum swung back it pushed the block strongly downwards. The block carried a contact which completed the circuit to the electromagnet which impelled the pendulum. The pendulum was only impelled as required.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{investigate}} the optical clock recovery {{operation of a}} colliding-pulse mode-locked laser with integrated active-passive waveguides. Nearly transformed-limited 10 GHz recovered clock signal was demonstrated with low timing jitter and error free performance. Optical clock recovery [1, 2] is an important function for realizing all-optical communication systems, allowing the extraction and regeneration of a clear optical <b>clock</b> <b>train</b> from a degraded data-stream and subsequent 3 R regeneration. Semiconductor mode locked lasers offers a compact solution for this application, and has been previously demonstrated in high bit rate applications[2]. In this paper, we report the investigation of optical clock recovery at 10 GHz using a colliding-pulsed mode-locked (CPM) laser with integrated active-passive waveguides for the first time. Fig. 1 shows the fabricated buried heterostructure (BH) 10 GHz CPM laser with a 2000 µm long active section, monolithically integrated on either side with passive waveguides to form the 8200 µm long laser cavity [3]. The 45 µm saturable absorber (SA) situated {{at the center of}} the laser cavity allows two identical pulses to circulate symmetrically within the cavity and collide at the SA, generating two pulses per round-trip time. In this CPM configuration the SA experiences deeper saturation compared to conventional mode locked (ML) lasers, resulting in more stable mode locking and more efficient pulse shaping [4]. The active passive integration approach with shorte...|$|E
5000|$|The {{escapement}} is {{a mechanical}} linkage that converts the force from the <b>clock's</b> wheel <b>train</b> into impulses {{that keep the}} pendulum swinging back and forth. It is the part that makes the [...] "ticking" [...] sound in a working pendulum clock. Most escapements consist of a wheel with pointed teeth called the escape wheel which is turned by the <b>clock's</b> wheel <b>train,</b> and surfaces the teeth push against, called pallets. During most of the pendulum's swing the wheel is prevented from turning because a tooth is resting {{against one of the}} pallets; this is called the [...] "locked" [...] state. Each swing of the pendulum a pallet releases a tooth of the escape wheel. The wheel rotates forward a fixed amount until a tooth catches on the other pallet. These releases allow the <b>clock's</b> wheel <b>train</b> to advance a fixed amount with each swing, moving the hands forward at a constant rate, controlled by the pendulum.|$|R

Experiments show that the proposed unit-delay architecture consumes only 0. 89 mW power and 100 (mum) 2 area in 65 nm which is 16. 8 times less power and 35 times less area than other works while power and area consumed in the PI-based PLL architecture depends upon {{the complexity of the}} PI itself...|$|R
