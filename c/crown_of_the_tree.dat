25|$|No {{definite}} relation {{exists between}} the annual rings of growth {{and the amount of}} sapwood. Within the same species the cross-sectional area of the sapwood is very roughly proportional {{to the size of the}} <b>crown</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree.</b> If the rings are narrow, more of them are required than where they are wide. As the tree gets larger, the sapwood must necessarily become thinner or increase materially in volume. Sapwood is relatively thicker in the upper portion of the trunk of a tree than near the base, because the age and the diameter of the upper sections are less.|$|E

50|$|Excessive {{wildfire}} prevention {{disrupts the}} fire ecology. The stands are usually so densely populated that <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> self-thin, or out-compete each other, leaving dead trees standing.

50|$|The circumferences of {{the trunks}} {{at the point}} of their {{smallest}} diameter were measured in 2000 to 2.40 m and 2.00 m metres, and the total circumference was measured in 2007 at 7.00 m metres. The <b>crown</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is 7 m tall.|$|E
50|$|Like {{many old}} growth redwoods, trunks within the crown are {{hydraulically}} linked by fused branches.

5000|$|An average {{forest tree}} will release 1000 litres (220 imp gal; 264 US gal) of water vapor into the {{atmosphere}} every day. It {{has been found that}} whereas every square metre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea evaporates one litre of water each day, <b>the</b> same area <b>of</b> forest evaporates about eight times as much because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multiple layers <b>of</b> foliage in <b>the</b> <b>crown</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees.</b> <b>The</b> main airflow in the Amazon basin is towards the southwest. When this air mass reaches the Andes, the mountain range acts as a [...] "natural barrier", redirecting huge volumes of humid air towards central and southern Brazil as well as towards northern Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, and rain falls in these areas. Some part of this air manages to surmount the cordillera and deposits rain in Peru. Other air masses travel northwards from the Amazon basin, passing over Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, French Guiana, and Suriname.|$|R
5|$|Trees {{are either}} evergreen, having foliage that {{persists}} and remains green throughout the year, or deciduous, shedding their leaves at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> growing season {{and then having}} a dormant period without foliage. Most conifers are evergreens but larches (Larix and Pseudolarix) are deciduous, dropping their needles each autumn, and some species of cypress (Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) shed small leafy shoots annually in {{a process known as}} cladoptosis. The crown is a name for <b>the</b> spreading top <b>of</b> a <b>tree</b> including <b>the</b> branches and leaves, while the uppermost layer in a forest, formed by <b>the</b> <b>crowns</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> is known as the canopy.

50|$|Detailed three {{dimensional}} {{mapping of}} the trunk and major branches of trees can be done for significant specimens. The methodology used to map the Middleton Oak and the Sag Branch Tuliptree was developed by Dr. Robert Van Pelt. This process is called canopy mapping.

50|$|Urera are lianas, shrubs, {{and small}} trees. Climbing species root along the stems and can reach <b>the</b> <b>crowns</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> they use for support. Some are spiny. They almost always have urticating hairs, often on {{bumps in the}} epidermis. These are stiff, {{stinging}} trichomes with swollen bases. The leaves are variable in shape and venation, and help in <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> species. Also useful is the varying appearance and arrangement <b>of</b> cystoliths on <b>the</b> leaf surface. The inflorescence is a divided, branching panicle of flowers. Most species are dioecious, but a few are monoecious. Most species have male flowers with either four or five stamens and tepals. Female flowers generally have four uneven, free to mostly fused tepals. The fruit is an achene covered in orange or red flesh.|$|R

5|$|The Australian ringneck {{is active}} {{during the day}} and can be found in {{eucalypt}} woodlands and eucalypt-lined watercourses.

50|$|Banyan-like trees {{similarly}} {{consist of}} multiple trunks spread across a large area. In {{many of these}} specimens the interior trunks are not easily accessible. An approach to their measurement would be to measure the area occupied by the many trunks, the area occupied by the <b>crown</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree,</b> {{the height of the}} tree, and any other measurements the investigator deems appropriate. These measurements would then be supplemented by a narrative description and photographs. The goal in all of these cases of trees with unusual forms is to document their characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Assessment of the {{damaging}} {{effect of}} construction activities {{on a tree}} can be based on three factors: severity, extent and duration. Fundamentally activity should avoid the <b>crown</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> and the volume of rooting required by the tree for ongoing vitality. Severity {{is related to the}} degree of intrusion into the rooting area and resultant root loss. Extent is related to a percentage of a factor such as canopy, roots or bark, and duration is based on the length of time that the activity interferes with the tree's normal functions.|$|E

25|$|Mild to {{moderate}} fires burn {{in the forest}} understory, removing small trees and herbaceous groundcover. High-severity fires will burn into <b>the</b> <b>crowns</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> and kill most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dominant vegetation. <b>Crown</b> fires may require support from ground fuels to maintain {{the fire in the}} forest canopy (passive crown fires), or the fire may burn in <b>the</b> canopy independently <b>of</b> any ground fuel support (an active crown fire). High-severity fire creates complex early seral forest habitat, or snag forest with high levels of biodiversity. When a forest burns frequently and thus has less plant litter build-up, below-ground soil temperatures rise only slightly and will not be lethal to roots that lie deep in the soil. Although other characteristics of a forest will influence <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> fire upon it, factors such as climate and topography {{play an important role in}} determining fire severity and fire extent. Fires spread most widely during drought years, are most severe on upper slopes and are influenced by <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> vegetation that is growing.|$|R
30|$|The mean (and {{range in}} brackets) for {{diameter}} at breast height, height and <b>crown</b> mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> selected <b>trees</b> were respectively 20.95 cm (17.6 – 24.3 cm), 13.25 m (11.7 – 16.5 m) and 66.2 kg (29 – 146.2 kg).|$|R
40|$|Part of a {{rainfall}} {{is captured}} by <b>the</b> <b>crowns</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> and other surfaces as interception, {{which is then}} evaporated back into the atmosphere. Water moves down through the forest canopy via two mechanisms; stemflow and throughfall processes. Stemflow refers to <b>the</b> total quantity <b>of</b> rain water which reach <b>the</b> ground through <b>tree</b> stems and branches. Throughfall in the other hand, is <b>the</b> tendency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rainfalls to penetrate the forest canopy directly through the spaces between the leaves or by dripping from the leaves, twigs, and branches. Both components were measured in an interception plot size 100 ¥ 100 m 2 in a secondary tropical forest at Tasik Chini. Thirty tree samples were used and each tree was well-identified based on their species, family, diameter breast height (DBH), canopy size and its density. In this study, {{the data were collected}} based on two rainfall events, namely in November 2007 (44. 51 % in throughfall form and 55. 49 % in stem flow form) and rainfall distribution on December 2007 (39. 65 % in throughfall form and 60. 35 % in stem flow form).
