5|$|The Apple-Cohen dispute was a <b>cybersquatting</b> {{case where}} a {{top-level}} domain registrar's decision differed from prior decisions by awarding a domain name to a subsequent registrant (Apple), {{rather than to the}} prior registrant (Cohen). As the decision recounts, in November 2000, Benjamin Cohen of CyberBritain registered the domain name itunes.co.uk. The domain initially pointed to skipmusic.com, and then to cyberbritain.com, and was then inoperative for some time. Apple applied for a UK trademark for iTunes in October 2000 which was granted in March 2001, and then launched its UK iTunes music store service in 2004. Afterward, Cohen reactivated his registered domain name, redirecting it to iTunes' then-rival, Napster; later Cohen forwarded the domain name to his CyberBritain's cash back/rewards website.|$|E

Frayne's stated intent for the site was a [...] "comprehensive, balanced discussion" [...] of the benefits and pitfalls of holding the Olympics in Chicago; the Chicago 2016 committee contended that his real intent was to profit from <b>cybersquatting.</b> The Chicago Olympic bid organization, which had been using Chicago2016.org as its official web site, sought control of Chicago2016.com through a complaint filed with an international arbitration organization. Attempts by the USOC to have the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) release the names failed. [...] Frayne sued in the U.S. District Court in Chicago, seeking an injunction against the arbitration proceedings.

2500|$|Most courts {{particularly}} frowned on <b>cybersquatting,</b> {{and found}} that it was itself a sufficiently commercial use (i.e., [...] "trafficking" [...] in trademarks) to reach into the area of trademark infringement.

2500|$|In the US, {{the legal}} {{situation}} was clarified by the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, {{an amendment to}} the Lanham Act, which explicitly prohibited <b>cybersquatting.</b> It defines <b>cybersquatting</b> as [...] "(occurring) when a person other than the trademark holder registers the domain name of a well-known trademark and then attempts to profit from this by either ransoming the domain name back to the trademark holder or using the domain name to divert business from the trademark holder to the domain name holder". The provision states that [...] " [...] person shall be liable in a civil action by the owner of the mark ... if, without regard to the goods or services of the person, that person (i) had a bad faith intent to profit from the mark ...; and registers, traffics in, or uses domain name [...] ".|$|E

On July 26, 2007, WIPO found in favor of Jacobsen, ruling that Katzer's actions were found to be in [...] "bad faith", since [...] "there was essentially a purpose on the part of Katzer to disrupt the business of a competitor by interfering with Complainant's exercise of his trademark rights.".

2500|$|This {{conflict}} is easily resolved when the domain name owner actually uses the domain {{to compete with}} the trademark owner. <b>Cybersquatting,</b> however, does not involve competition. Instead, an unlicensed user registers a domain name identical to a trademark, and offers to sell the domain to the trademark owner. Typosquatters—those registering common misspellings of trademarks as domain names—have also been targeted successfully in trademark infringement suits. [...] "Gripe sites", on the other hand, tend to be protected as free speech, and are therefore more difficult to attack as trademark infringement.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1999, Glenn Sobel Management {{registered}} the website www.beveragesandmore.com, but Sobel was sued {{a year later}} by Beverages & More! for trademark infringement under ICANN jurisdiction. Beverages & More, Inc. aimed to show that their registered trademark [...] "Beverages & More!" [...] was being violated. Their testimony noted that the ampersand and the exclamation point in their trademark were not allowed in domain names, and that the www.beveragesandmore.com domain was the closest analog available to them. In court, Glenn Sobel did not deny {{that he was in}} the business of selling domain names, and that his company had never been known as [...] "beveragesandmore". Sobel was admittedly not in the business of selling beverages. In March 2000, the domain was ordered to be immediately transferred from Sobel to Beverages & More! with no fine or penalty—a decision reached by Richard D. Faulkner, an ICANN judge in Dallas, Texas. The decision set a precedent that has since been quoted by complainants in <b>cybersquatting</b> cases to show that a domain name matching a trademark, one held by other than the trademark holder, [...] "is evidence of bad faith registration and use".|$|E
