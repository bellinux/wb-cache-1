5|$|The barren desert {{surface of}} Ceti Alpha V was {{simulated}} on stage 8, the largest sound stage at Paramount's studio. The set was elevated 25 {{feet off the}} ground and covered in wooden mats, over which tons of colored sand and powder were dumped. A cyclorama was painted and wrapped around the set, while massive industrial fans created a sandstorm. The filming was uncomfortable for actors and crew alike. The spandex environmental suits Koenig and Winfield wore were unventilated, and the actors had to signal by microphone when they needed air. Filming equipment was wrapped in plastic to prevent mechanical troubles and everyone on set wore boots, masks, and <b>coveralls</b> as protection from flying sand.|$|E
5|$|In December1941, {{just before}} the attack on Pearl Harbor, he went to Iowa City, where he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Force (USAAF) Flying Cadet program with a recruiter. On January 17 of the {{following}} year, {{he was sent to}} Fort Des Moines and soon inducted into the USAAF. Not long after, he and other new inductees went to Minter Field in Bakersfield, California for more physical examinations, and then they went north to Visalia for primary training in January23. The class (which had to wear <b>coveralls</b> {{due to the lack of}} standard uniforms) first trained in Ryan PT-22 Recruits before moving back to Minter Field for basic flight training in BT-13 Valiants. Along with his brother Robert, who had also enlisted, Hagerstrom spent about six weeks in basic training. Hagerstrom and his classmates then went to Luke Field near Phoenix, Arizona for advanced flight training in the North American AT-6. On July 26, 1942, he was commissioned a second lieutenant and received his wings from Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead.|$|E

It has largely replaced for shipboard use polyester cotton blend <b>coveralls</b> that provided inadequate fire protection and the NWU Type I for the same reason. The all cotton FRVs are dark blue in color compared to the older <b>coveralls,</b> which are lighter. They use rectangular velcro-backed nametags similar to those worn on flight crew suits, rather than the nametapes of the previous coverall.|$|E

40|$|Clothes-borne {{transmission}} {{is an important}} way of spread of infection from patient to patient which is not interrupted by common cotton gowns. New barrier garments were designed from spun-bonded olefin that, in particle penetration tests, was 100 times better as a filter than cotton cloth. Three designs, a gown, a loose <b>coverall</b> and a close overall, were compared {{with each other and}} with conventional cotton gowns in experimental exercise and nursing procedures. Staphylococcus aureus from burned patients were used as markers. The close <b>coverall</b> was 4 - 7 times better than the loose <b>coverall</b> or gown in preventing the soiling of clothes worn underneath it, but appeared to permit substantially more transfer from garments underneath it to a mock 'patient' and to the air than did the looser garments. A cotton gown reduced the soiling of clothes underneath it by more than 10 times and the contamination of a mock patient by more than 30 times as compared with no barrier garment. The close <b>coverall</b> further diminished the contamination of clothes but not the transfer to the patient.

50|$|The WHO {{recommends}} {{the use of}} 2 pairs of gloves, with the outer pair worn over the gown. Using 2 pairs may {{reduce the risk of}} sharp injuries; however, {{there is no evidence that}} using more than the recommended will give additional protection. WHO also {{recommends the}} use of a <b>coverall,</b> which is generally appraised in terms of its resistance to non-enveloped DNA virus. When a gown (or <b>coverall)</b> is worn, it should continue beyond the shoe covers. According to guidelines released by the CDC in August 2015, updates were put in place to improve the PAPR doffing method to make the steps easier, and affirm the importance of cleaning the floor where doffing has been done. Additionally, a designated doffing assistant was recommended to help in this process. The order in which boot covers are removed, by these guidelines, indicates their removal after the <b>coverall</b> or gown. Finally, a trained observer is to read to the healthcare worker each step in donning and doffing, but must not physically assist therein.|$|R
25|$|U.S. Fleet Forces Command (FFC) {{continues}} a multi-phase {{wear test}} of improved flame resistant variant (IFRV) working uniform components for shipboard wear.

Additional feedback from the focus groups, subsequently validated by a senior level working group, resulted in the preliminary design of a more professional looking two-piece utility shipboard uniform that can be worn both at sea and operational support jobs ashore. Wear tests of the prototype two-piece variants are expected to occur in 2017.|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{insulation}} of clothing is commonly determined by dry thermal manikins either {{made of plastic}} or metal. For the determination of evaporative resistance of clothing ensemble, there exist three types of manikin methods: pre-wetted underwear or “skin” covered on dry manikins, the manikin with regulated constant water supply to the “skin” surface and the sweating fabric manikin based on a water filled body covered with waterproof but vapour permeable fabrics. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare {{thermal insulation}} and moisture evaporative resistance of a set of protective clothing measured using different type of manikins. The total thermal insulation of seven EU project ensembles (Subzero A and B, Permeable (PERM), Impermeable (IMP), Nomex <b>coverall</b> (with two types of underwear) and Cotton <b>coverall)</b> were measured using the manikin Tore in Sweden, the sweating fabric manikin Walter in Hong Kong, and the manikin Newton in the UK. The results showed that total thermal insulation is reproducible for the seven clothing ensembles measured on the manikins Walter and Tore. The coefficient of variance is less than 8 %. Nomex <b>coverall</b> with cotton underwear has 8 - 16 % higher total insulation than that with polypropylene underwear. The apparent evaporative resistance of the impermeable <b>coverall</b> with cotton underwear measured on Newton was 44. 5 % lower than the evaporative resistance measured on Walter. The effect of condensation and conduction at room temperature environment and measuring time allowing full accumulation of moisture in clothing ensembles might be two important factors affecting the evaporative resistance...|$|R

500|$|Establishing the characters' {{background}} {{rather than}} prettiness {{was the main}} goal of costumes. Ben wore the same clothes in both seasons, and {{to make them look}} identical, around twenty multiples of his <b>coveralls</b> were made by hand. It took over six weeks to apply all stitches, patches and the roughly fifty holes, plus the aging process. Brother Justin's clothes were made period-correct from the beginning, but the character's foreboding presence was enhanced by fitting his frock on the waist and making the shoulders look bigger than usual for that time period. Sofie's clothes had a strong Bohemian Eastern influence to portray her mother's origin and sensibilities. Stumpy's wardrobe consisted of baggy pants and an Italian bowler hat that gave him a 1920s look instead of the 1930s, showing his clothes were second-hand. The stripper clothes of Rita Sue and Libby were influenced by Mae West, harlot movies and silent films of the 1920s and 1930s, with additional research put into Asian harlots, Latin dancers and Hawaiian dancers. The costume designers chose the costumes of the Daily Brothers Show, a rival carnival, to have a new color tone to set them apart from the Carnivàle. The dress of Sabina the Scorpion Lady underwent several die-bleaching cycles to achieve a red-orange-purple color that would work well when filming outside. Bert/Bertha's costume was made in a hurry from a vintage tuxedo and an old feathered dress, which helped to give it a [...] "made-it-on-the-road" [...] feeling.|$|E
500|$|The tunnel {{construction}} became unintentionally {{involved in}} the women's rights movement when Janet Bonnema applied for a position as an engineering technician with the Colorado Department of Transportation. She was given an assignment on the Straight Creek Tunnels project, but her supervisor misread her resume and thought he was hiring [...] "James". When the supervisor discovered the department had hired a woman, she was instead tasked with doing support work from the office. There was opposition to a woman entering the construction site: One supervisor stated that if she entered, [...] "Those workers would flat walk out of that there tunnel and they'd never come back". The workers, most of whom had a mining background, expressed a common superstition that a woman brought bad luck to a mine. One worker insisted, [...] "It's a jinx. I've seen too many die after a woman was in the tunnel." [...] Bonnema sued the department {{for the right to}} work inside the tunnel. She countered she was in better shape and more agile than most of the men working on the tunnel. Emboldened by the passage of an equal rights law in Colorado, she finally entered the tunnel, with an entourage of reporters, on November 9, 1972. Some workers did walk off the job; at least one yelled, [...] "Get those women out of here". She remained determined and re-entered the tunnel a few days later. The next time she dressed in <b>coveralls,</b> and was even assigned tasks {{on the roof of the}} tunnel overlooking the men below. Surprised that nobody apparently noticed she was a woman, she stated, [...] "I had a good disguise".|$|E
