40|$|A <b>carbothermal</b> {{hydrogen}} <b>reduction</b> {{method was}} employed for {{the preparation of}} activated carbon supported bimetallic carbide. The resultant samples were characterized by BET surface area measurement, X-ray diffraction, and temperature-programmed reduction-mass spectroscopy. The results showed that nanostructured beta-Mo 2 C can be formed on the activated carbon by <b>carbothermal</b> hydrogen <b>reduction</b> above 700 degreesC. The particle sizes of beta-Mo 2 C increase with increasing reaction temperatures and Mo loading. The bimetallic CoMo carbide can be synthesized by the <b>carbothermal</b> hydrogen <b>reduction</b> even around 600 degreesC. The bimetallic CoMo carbide is from <b>carbothermal</b> hydrogen <b>reduction</b> of CoMoO 4 precursor and is easily formed when the Co/Mo molar ratio is 1. 0. Separation of the bimetallic CoMo carbide phase into Mo carbide and Co metal occurs when {{the temperature of the}} reduction is above 700 degreesC. The addition of a second metal such as Co and Ni, decreases the formation temperature of carbide because the second metal promotes formation of CHx species from reactive carbon atoms or groups on carbon material and hydrogen, which further carburizes oxide precursors.

40|$|Molybdenum carbide {{catalysts}} {{were successfully}} prepared using original multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and nitric acid treated ones as support and carbon source by <b>carbothermal</b> hydrogen <b>reduction</b> from 580 C to 700 C. Ammonium heptamolybdate {{was used as}} Mo precursor {{and the effects of}} oxygen functional groups on MWCNT surface were investigated. TEM and XRD results show that oxygen functional groups act as anchor sites to interact with the Mo oxyanion species during impregnation, which promote the dispersion of Mo precursors. Due to the relatively strong interaction between Mo precursors and MWCNTs, the agglomeration of Mo carbide particles is prevented even when the treatment temperature is as high as 700 C. Moreover, as the support, modified MWCNTs exhibit better thermal resistances. The temperature (580 C) for Mo 2 C formation over MWCNTs is much lower than that over conventional carbon supports using <b>carbothermal</b> hydrogen <b>reduction.</b> The methylcyclohexane dehydrogenation was used as a probe reaction to test the catalytic performances of the Mo 2 C catalysts obtained.

Depending on the temperature of carbothermal treatment, different tungsten species, i. e., W, W 2 C, WC, were formed on the carbon matrix. No significant changes in both surface areas and mesostructures were observed during the formation of various tungsten species on carbon surfaces under high-temperature conditions. A uniform dispersion of Pt nanoparticles (1 - 6 nm) can be achieved via nanoconfinement on the surfaces of both mesoporous carbon and tungsten carbide-modified mesoporous carbon. Pt nanoparticles supported on mesoporous carbons modified with tungsten carbide (Pt/WC-C) exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic activities relative to the control, in which mesoporous carbons without carbide modification were directly used as a support (Pt/C). In addition, both enhanced thermal stability and good electrochemical stability were observed for the Pt/WC-C electrocatalyst. Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R
