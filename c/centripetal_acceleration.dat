5|$|Water megamasers {{may be used}} {{to provide}} {{accurate}} distance determinations to distant galaxies. Assuming a Keplerian orbit, measuring the <b>centripetal</b> <b>acceleration</b> and velocity of water maser spots yields the physical diameter subtended by the maser spots. By then comparing the physical radius to the angular diameter measured on the sky, the distance to the maser may be determined. This method is effective with water megamasers because they occur in a small region around an AGN, and have narrow linewidths. This method of measuring distances is being used to provide an independent measure of the Hubble constant that does not rely upon use of standard candles. The method is limited, however, by the small number of water megamasers known at distances within the Hubble flow. This distance measurement also provides a measurement of the mass of the central object, which in this case is a supermassive black hole. Black hole mass measurements using water megamasers is the most accurate method of mass determination for black holes in galaxies other than the Milky Way. The black hole masses that are measured are consistent with the M-sigma relation, an empirical correlation between stellar velocity dispersion in galactic bulges and the mass of the central supermassive black hole.|$|E

25|$|These {{equations}} express mathematically that, in {{the case}} of an object that moves along a circular path with a changing speed, the acceleration of the body may be decomposed into a perpendicular component that changes the direction of motion (the <b>centripetal</b> <b>acceleration),</b> and a parallel, or tangential component, that changes the speed.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between these phenomena is only valid if the observer and source's frames are inertial frames. In practice, because the Earth is not an inertial rest frame but experiences <b>centripetal</b> <b>acceleration</b> towards the Sun, many aberrational effects such as annual aberration on Earth cannot be considered light-time corrections. However, if the time between emission and detection of the light is short compared to the orbital period of the Earth, the Earth may be approximated as an inertial frame and aberrational effects are equivalent to light-time corrections.|$|E
25|$|Figure 1 {{illustrates}} {{velocity and}} acceleration vectors for uniform motion at four {{different points in}} the orbit. Because the velocity v is tangent to the circular path, no two velocities point in the same direction. Although the object has a constant speed, its direction is always changing. This change in velocity is caused by an acceleration a, whose magnitude is (like that of the velocity) held constant, but whose direction also is always changing. The acceleration points radially inwards (centripetally) and is perpendicular to the velocity. This acceleration is known as <b>centripetal</b> <b>acceleration.</b>|$|E
25|$|In physics, uniform {{circular}} motion describes {{the motion of}} a body traversing a circular path at constant speed. Since the body describes {{circular motion}}, its distance from the axis of rotation remains constant at all times. Though the body's speed is constant, its velocity is not constant: velocity, a vector quantity, depends on both the body's speed and its direction of travel. This changing velocity indicates {{the presence of an}} acceleration; this <b>centripetal</b> <b>acceleration</b> is of constant magnitude and directed at all times towards the axis of rotation. This acceleration is, in turn, produced by a centripetal force which is also constant in magnitude and directed towards the axis of rotation.|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the contact interface and the propagation of compression waves inside a single wave rotor passage gradually opening to and traversing an inlet port is studied numerically using an inviscid formulation of the governing equations. Insights into {{the response of the}} interface and kinematics of the flow field to various opening times are given. Since the opening time is inversely proportional to the rotational speed of the rotor, the effects of passage rotation such as <b>centripetal</b> and Coriolis <b>accelerations</b> are intrinsically coupled to the gradual opening process. Certain three-dimensional features associated with the gradual opening process as a result of <b>centripetal</b> and Coriolis <b>accelerations</b> are illustrated. For the range of opening times or rotational speeds considered, a portion of the interface behaves like a vortex sheet that can degenerate into a complex interfacial structure. The vortices produced along the interface can serve as a stirring mechanism to promote local mixing. Coriolis and <b>centripetal</b> <b>accelerations</b> can introduce three dimensional effects such as interfacial distortions in meridional planes and spanwise migration of fluid elements...|$|R

25|$|In {{the case}} of distant objects and a {{rotating}} reference frame, what {{must be taken into}} account is the resultant force of centrifugal and Coriolis force. Consider a distant star observed from a rotating spacecraft. In the reference frame co-rotating with the spacecraft, the distant star appears to move along a circular trajectory around the spacecraft. The apparent motion of the star is an apparent <b>centripetal</b> <b>acceleration.</b> Just like in the example above of the car in circular motion, the centrifugal force has the same magnitude as the fictitious centripetal force, but is directed in the opposite, centrifugal direction. In this case the Coriolis force is twice the magnitude of the centrifugal force, and it points in centripetal direction. The vector sum of the centrifugal force and the Coriolis force is the total fictitious force, which in this case points in centripetal direction.|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper McGaugh, Lelli, and Schombert {{showed that in}} an {{empirical}} plot of the observed <b>centripetal</b> <b>accelerations</b> in spiral galaxies against those predicted by the Newtonian gravity of the luminous matter in those galaxies the data points occupied a remarkably narrow band. While one could summarize the mean properties of the band by drawing a single mean curve through it, by fitting the band with the illustrative conformal gravity theory with fits that fill out {{the width of the}} band we show here that the width of the band is just as physically significant. We show that at very low luminous Newtonian accelerations the plot can become independent of the luminous Newtonian contribution altogether, but still be non-trivial due to the contribution of matter outside of the galaxies (viz. the rest of the visible universe). We present a new empirical plot of the difference between the observed <b>centripetal</b> <b>accelerations</b> and the luminous Newtonian expectations as a function of distance from the centers of galaxies, and show that at distances greater than 10 kpc the plot also occupies a remarkably narrow band, one even close to constant.

30|$|There are {{two reasons}} for the {{improved}} results when basal resistance is parameterized with the Bingham rheology. The first is that <b>centripetal</b> <b>accelerations</b> do not increase basal resistance (as in the Voellmy rheology); so the flowing mass expends less momentum overtopping the ridge. The second is that deposition is now controlled by both flow depth and slope angle, {{as opposed to the}} frictional and Voellmy rheologies, where deposition is controlled by slope angle alone. This allows the mass to deposit both on the steep overtopped ridge, {{as well as at the}} distal toe. These two factors provide strong justification for the use of the Bingham rheology to simulate the West Salt Creek rock avalanche.|$|R
