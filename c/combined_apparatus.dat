40|$|During {{the first}} LHC running period 2009 [...] 2012 TOTEM {{collected}} {{a wealth of}} data at sqrt(s) = 7 and 8 TeV, mostly in special runs at reduced luminosity, allowing a comprehensive scrutiny of large cross-section processes. After the first Long Shutdown, TOTEM will join forces with its partner experiment CMS, creating a <b>combined</b> <b>apparatus</b> with the largest rapidity coverage and with the most performing two-arm proton spectrometer ever built at a collider. Focussing {{on the process of}} central diffraction opens unique opportunities for exploring QCD in new phase space regions and for the search for new physics. First studies of central diffraction and, in particular, diffractive dijet production in special runs in 2012 together with CMS have provided the proof of concept, but demonstrate that even at moderate luminosities a key issue to be overcome in physics with leading protons is the pileup of several events per bunch crossing. This document outlines the TOTEM strategy for increasing the reachable integrated luminosity and rendering its apparatus capable of resolving event pileup and multiple tracks in the proton detectors. In addition to the already approved consolidation programme including the relocation of the old Roman Pot station RP 147 to the region between the quadrupole Q 5 and the Roman Pot station RP 220, TOTEM proposes the installation of two new Roman Pots designed to accomodate timing detectors for reconstructing the longitudinal vertex position of the leading protons in central diffractive events. Thus the protons can be assigned to the appropriate central vertex reconstructed by the CMS tracking detectors. Furthermore, the present silicon strip detectors are foreseen to be replaced by radiation-hard pixel detectors with better tracking capability...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOn 24 March 2007, the {{atmosphere}} over Central Europe {{was affected by}} an episode of exceptionally high mass concentrations of aerosol particles, most likely caused by a dust storm in the Southern Ukraine on the preceding day. At ground-based measurement stations in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland and Germany PM 10 mass concentrations rose to values between 200 and 1400 ?g m ? 3. An evaluation of PM 10 measurements from 360 monitoring stations showed that the dust cloud advanced along a narrow corridor at speeds of up to 70 km h ? 1. According to lidar observations over Leipzig, Germany, the high aerosol concentrations were confined to a homogeneous boundary layer of 1800 m height. The wavelength dependence of light extinction using both lidar and sun photometer measurements suggested the dominance of coarse particles during the main event. At a wavelength of 532 nm, relatively high volume extinction coefficients (300 ? 400 Mm ? 1) and a particle optical depth of 0. 65 was observed. In-situ measurements with an aerodynamic particle sizer at Melpitz, Germany, confirmed {{the presence of a}} coarse particle mode with a mode diameter > 2 ?m, whose maximum concentration coincided with that of PM 10. A chemical particle analysis confirmed the dominance of non-volatile and insoluble matter in the coarse mode as well as high enrichments of Ti and Fe, which are characteristic of soil dust. A combination of back trajectory calculations and satellite images allowed to identify the dust source with confidence: On 23 March 2007, large amounts of dust were emitted from dried-out farmlands in the southern Ukraine, facilitated by wind gusts up to 100 km h ? 1. The unusual vertical stability and confined height of this dust layer as well as the rapid transport under dry conditions led to the conservation of high aerosol mass concentrations along the transect and thus to the extraordinary high aerosol concentrations over Central Europe. Our observations demonstrate the capacity of a <b>combined</b> <b>apparatus</b> of in situ and remote sensing measurements to characterise such a dust with a variety of aerosol parameters. As a conclusion, the description of dust emission, transport and transformation processes needs to be improved, especially when facing the possible effects of further anthropogenic desertification and climate change...|$|E

40|$|Robotic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is {{the problem}} of solving how to create a map of the {{environment}} while localizing the robot in the map being created. This presents a causality dilemma where the map needs to be created in order to localize the robot, but the robot also needs to be localized in order to create the map. In past research there have been many solutions to this problem ranging from Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to Graph SLAM systems. There has also been extensive research in bioinspired methods, like ratSLAM implemented in aerial and land-based robots. The different research setups use sensors such as Time of Flight (ToF) e. g. laser scanners and passive devices e. g. cameras. Over the past few years a new type of <b>combined</b> <b>apparatus</b> has been developed by Microsoft called the Kinect. It combines active and passive sensing elements and aligns the data in a way which allows for efficient implementation in robotic systems. This has led to the Kinect being implemented in new research and many studies, mostly around RGB-D SLAM. However these methods generally require a continuous stream of images and become inaccurate when exposed to ambiguous environments. This thesis presents the design and implementation of a fusion algorithm to solve the robotic SLAM problem. The study starts by analysing existing methods to determine what research has been done. It then proceeds to introduce the components used in this study and the Fusion Algorithm. The algorithm incorporates the colour and depth data extraction and manipulation methods used in the RGB-D SLAM system while also implementing a mapping step similar to the grid cell and firing field functions found in the ratSLAM. This method improves upon the RGB-D SLAM’s weakness of requiring a continuous stream and ambiguous images. An experiment is then conducted on the developed system {{to determine the extent to}} which it has solved the SLAM problem. Moreover, the success rate for finding a node in a cell and matching its pose is also investigated. In conclusion, this research presents a novel algorithm for successfully solving the robotic SLAM problem. The proposed algorithm also helps improve the system’s efficiency in navigation, odometry error correction, and scan matching vulnerabilities in feature sparse views...|$|E
40|$|For the {{development}} of solid oral dosage forms the determination of drug release and permeability is of particular importance. To be close to real human conditions, the use of systems which combine testing of both parameters is meaningful. Therefore, an apparatus was developed especially for this approach which uses well-established Caco- 2 cells as permeation barrier. Circumventing some drawbacks of Caco- 2 cells, several non-cellular barriers were developed for classical transport experiments, which are known as so-called parallel artificial membrane permeability assays. In the present work a non-cellular permeation barrier was developed especially for the use in the combined dissolution and permeation apparatus and successfully characterized regarding its coatig assembly, stability and permeation properties in comparison to Caco- 2 cell monolayers for both drug solutions and solid oral dosage forms. This artificial membrane presents a valuable alternative to Caco- 2 cells. Furthermore, the suitability of the <b>combined</b> <b>apparatus</b> to analyze effects of excipients, in particular P-glycoprotein inhibitors, was tested. Due {{to the construction of}} the apparatus the absorptive transport could only be determined which resulted in much smaller inhibition effects. The results obtained with drug solutions and tablets indicated a limited use of the combined system in this context necessitating further investigations. Während der Entwicklung von festen oralen Arzneiformen ist die Bestimmung der Wirkstofffreisetzung sowie der Permeabilität von besonderer Bedeutung. Um nah an menschlichen Bedingungen zu sein ist die Verwendung von Systemen, die beide Parameter kombinieren, sinnvoll. Daher wurde ein Gerät speziell für diesen Ansatz entwickelt, welches etablierte Caco- 2 Zellen als Permeationsbarriere nutzt. Um einige Nachteile von Caco- 2 Zellen zu umgehen, wurden verschiedene nicht-zelluläre Barrieren für den Einsatz in klassischen Transportversuchen entwickelt, die als parallele artifizielle Membran-Permeabilitäts-Assays bekannt sind. In dieser Arbeit wurde eine nicht-zelluläre Barriere speziell für den Einsatz in einem kombinierten Freisetzungs- und Permeationsgerät entwickelt und erfolgreich bezüglich Coatingaufbau, Stabilität und Permeationseigenschaften im Vergleich zu Caco- 2 Zellen sowohl mit Wirkstofflösungen als auch mit Tabletten charakterisiert. Diese künstliche Membran stellt eine wertvolle Alternative zu Caco- 2 Zellen dar. Des Weiteren wurde der Einsatz des Gerätes zur Analyse von Hilfsstoffeffekten, insbesondere P-Glykoprotein Hemmer, getestet. Aufgrund des Geräteaufbaus konnte nur der absorptive Transport bestimmt werden, was in viel geringeren Transportereffekten resultierte.
