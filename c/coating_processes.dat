25|$|Fiber optic {{coatings}} {{are applied}} in concentric layers to prevent {{damage to the}} fiber during the drawing application and to maximize fiber strength and microbend resistance. Unevenly coated fiber will experience non-uniform forces when the coating expands or contracts, and is susceptible to greater signal attenuation.

25|$|Plasma {{polymerization}} (or {{glow discharge}} polymerization) uses plasma sources {{to generate a}} gas discharge that provides energy to activate or fragment gaseous or liquid monomer, often containing a vinyl group, in order to initiate polymerization. Polymers formed from this technique are generally highly branched and highly cross-linked, and adhere to solid surfaces well. The biggest advantage to this process is that polymers can be directly attached to a desired surface while the chains are growing, which reduces steps necessary for other <b>coating</b> <b>processes</b> such as grafting. This is very useful for pinhole-free coatings of 100 picometers to 1 micrometre thickness with solvent insoluble polymers.|$|E
25|$|A second {{advantage}} is {{the ease of}} application of the polymers as coatings versus conventional <b>coating</b> <b>processes.</b> While coating a substrate with conventional polymers requires a number of steps, plasma polymerization accomplishes all these in essentially a single step. This leads to a cleaner and ‘greener’ synthesis and coating process, since no solvent is needed during the polymer preparation and no cleaning of the resultant polymer is needed either. Another ‘green’ aspect of the synthesis is that no initiator is needed for the polymer preparation since reusable electrodes cause the reaction to proceed. The resultant polymer coatings also {{have a number of}} advantages over typical coatings. These advantages include being nearly pinhole free, highly dense, and that the thickness of the coating can easily be varied.|$|E

TiA 1 N coatings are usually used in high-speed machining due to its excellent surface hardness and wear resistance. The TiA 1 N coatings were produced using Physical Vapour Deposition magnetron sputtering <b>process.</b> The <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> parameter will be selected as the input parameters and the hardness as an output of the process. There are several <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> parameters in TiA 1 N <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> but for this paper only three <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> parameter will be considered. A support vector machine model will be proposed to predict the coating hardness with respect to changes in input process parameters which are substrate sputtering power, bias voltage and temperature. In this paper, a literature survey concerning the prediction technique of TiA 1 N <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> is conducted in order to clarify their <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> and <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> parameters.

40|$|Nowadays, coated {{materials}} {{are widely used}} due to their excellent properties especially for the hardness performance. The hardness of coated tools {{is determined by the}} <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> parameters. Traditionally, optimization to obtain the best coating performance of the parameters in a <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> was done by trial and error approach. However the traditional approach has raised issues with regards to cost and customization. In this research, these two issues were addressed by using a computational intelligence approach to develop a model for predicting the output responses in order to identify the optimal parameters used in <b>coating</b> <b>process.</b> Previous studies have shown that this approach was successfully adopted for optimization purpose in many types of domains. However, it was not yet applied in the <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> domain. Thus, two methods from computational intelligence approach were applied, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The comparisons of the performances of the developed models were conducted based on predictive performance measurements such as percentage error, mean squared error (MSE), co-efficient determination (R 2), and model accuracy and complexity. The results showed that, SVM obtained better predictive performances and less complicated in comparison to other prediction models. As a conclusion, SVM has demonstrated its capability in predicting the hardness performance of <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> and outperformed the other models. Besides that, the model is a promising alternative tool for <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> optimization as compared to the traditional approac...|$|R

40|$|Modelling and {{simulation}} of an innovative fabric <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> using artificial neural networks Rocco Furferi, Lapo Governi and Yary Volpe A polyurethane-based fabric <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> requires {{a series of}} parameters to be set {{in order to meet}} the desired quality of the final product. Usually, the optimal setting of such parameters is performed by means of experimental tests, based on the experience of trained operators. The lack of understanding of the interaction between the <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> parameters and the final quality properties of the coated fabric encourages the development of predictive models. The main aim of the present work is to provide a predictive model of a particular <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> for forecasting the final characteristics of a coated fabric, based on the process parameters.
