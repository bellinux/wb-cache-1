5|$|The {{particles}} are sorted by yet {{another group of}} cilia, which send the smaller particles, mainly minerals, to the prostyle so eventually they are excreted, while the larger ones, mainly food, are sent to the stomach's <b>cecum</b> (a pouch with no other exit) to be digested. The sorting process {{is by no means}} perfect.|$|E
5|$|Bears have {{a fairly}} simple {{digestive}} system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short undifferentiated intestines and no <b>cecum.</b> Even the herbivorous giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Bears must {{spend much of their}} time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrates, {{the main}} energy source in most rations, are usually fed {{in the form}} of hay, grass, and grain. Soluble {{carbohydrates}} such as starches and sugars are readily broken down to glucose in the small intestine and absorbed. Insoluble carbohydrates, such as fiber (cellulose), are not digested by the horse's own enzymes, but are fermented by microbes in the <b>cecum</b> and large colon to break down and release their energy sources, volatile fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|The {{digestive}} system of beetles is primarily adapted for a herbivorous diet. Digestion takes place {{mostly in the}} anterior midgut, although in predatory groups like the Carabidae, most digestion occurs in the crop by means of midgut enzymes. In the Elateridae, the larvae are liquid feeders that extraorally digest their food by secreting enzymes. The alimentary canal basically consists of a short, narrow pharynx, a widened expansion, the crop, and a poorly developed gizzard. This {{is followed by the}} midgut, that varies in dimensions between species, with a large amount of <b>cecum,</b> and the hindgut, with varying lengths. There are typically four to six Malpighian tubules.|$|E
5|$|Equines are {{monogastric}} hindgut fermenters. They {{prefer to}} eat grasses and sedges, {{but may also}} consume bark, leaves, buds, fruits and roots if their favored foods are scarce, particularly asses. Compared to ruminants, equines have a simpler and less efficient digestive system. Nevertheless, they can subsist on lower quality vegetation. After food is passed though the stomach, it enters the sac-like <b>cecum.</b> where cellulose is broken down by micro-organisms. Fermentation is quicker in equines than in ruminants; 30–45 hours for a horse compared to 70–100 hours for a cow. Equines may spend 60-80 {{percent of their time}} feeding, depending on the availability and quality of vegetation. In the African savannas, the plains zebra is a pioneer grazer; mowing down the upper, less nutritious grass canopy and preparing the way for more specialized grazers like blue wildebeests and Thomson's gazelles which depend on shorter and more nutritious grasses below.|$|E
5|$|Mucinous, clear {{secretions}} may collect {{within these}} cysts to form either spherical masses or fusiform swellings, rarely larger than 2 to 3cm in diameter. These {{are present in}} the midline of the neck anterior to the trachea. Segments of the duct and cysts that occur high in the neck are lined by stratified squamous epithelium, which is essentially identical to that covering the posterior portion of the tongue in the region of the foramen <b>cecum.</b> The disorders that occur in the lower neck more proximal to the thyroid gland are lined by epithelium resembling the thyroidal acinar epithelium. Characteristically, next to the lining epithelium, there is an intense lymphocytic infiltrate. Superimposed infection may convert these lesions into abscess cavities, and rarely, give rise to cancers.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds have {{a simple}} stomach that is similar in {{structure}} to terrestrial carnivores. Most species have neither a <b>cecum</b> nor a clear demarcation between the small and large intestines; the large intestine is comparatively short and only slightly wider than the latter. Small intestine lengths range from 8 (California sea lion) to 25 times (elephant seal) the body length. The length of the intestine may be an adaptation to frequent deep diving, as the increased volume of the digestive tract serves as an extended storage compartment for partially digested food during submersion. Pinnipeds {{do not have an}} appendix. As in most marine mammals, the kidneys are divided into small lobes and can effectively absorb water and filter out excess salt.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{there is}} a third lobe present called the {{pyramidal}} lobe. When present, this lobe often stretches up the hyoid bone from the thyroid isthmus and may be one to several divided lobes. The presence of this lobe ranges in reported studies from 18.3% to 44.6%. It was shown to more often arise from the left side and occasionally separated. The pyramidal lobe is also known as Lalouette's pyramid. The pyramidal lobe is a remnant of the thyroglossal duct which usually wastes away during the thyroid gland's descent. Small accessory thyroid glands may in fact occur anywhere along the thyroglossal duct, from the foramen <b>cecum</b> of the tongue to the position of the thyroid in the adult. A small horn {{at the back of the}} thyroid lobes, usually close to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the inferior thyroid artery, is called Zuckerkandl's tubercle.|$|E
5|$|Parasitologist John Kinsella {{compared}} the endoparasites of marsh rice rats in a saltwater marsh at Cedar Key and a freshwater marsh at Paynes Prairie, both in Florida, in a 1988 study. He found {{a total of}} 45species, a number unequaled in rodents. This {{may be related to}} the diverse habitats the rice rat uses and to its omnivorous diet; it eats a variety of animals which may serve as intermediate hosts of various parasites. The endoparasites in the saltwater marsh were dominated by trematodes (flukes), and those of the freshwater marsh by nematodes (roundworms). Endoparasites were found in the gastric mucosa (which lines the stomach), the cavity of the stomach, the small intestine, the <b>cecum,</b> the large intestine, the pancreatic duct, the bile ducts, the mucus of the liver, the pulmonary arteries, the abdominal cavity, and the pleural cavity. While the marsh rice rat harbors a number of host-specific species, such as the nematode Aonchotheca forresteri, other parasite species, such as the lone star tick (pictured), are shared with other mammals. Compared to the hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), Florida marsh rice rats usually harbor fewer individual ectoparasites of each species. Borrelia, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, has been identified in some ticks that infect the marsh rice rat and it has been identified as a possible natural reservoir for Borrelia.|$|E
5|$|The stomach of Artiodactyls {{is divided}} into four sections: the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum and the abomasum (only {{ruminants}} have a rumen). After the plant material is consumed, it is mixed with saliva in the rumen and reticulum and separates into solid and liquid material. The solids lump {{together to form a}} bolus (or cud), and is regurgitated. When the bolus enters the mouth, the fluid is squeezed out with the tongue and swallowed again. Ingested food passes to the rumen and reticulum where cellulytic microbes (bacteria, protozoa and fungi) produce cellulase, which is needed to break down the cellulose in plants. Perissodactyls, in contrast to the ruminants, store digested food that has left the stomach in an enlarged <b>cecum,</b> where it is fermented by bacteria. Carnivora have a simple stomach adapted to digest primarily meat, as compared to the elaborate digestive systems of herbivorous animals, which are necessary to break down tough, complex plant fibers. The caecum is either absent or short and simple, and the large intestine is not sacculated or much wider than the small intestine.|$|E
5|$|To {{maintain}} a high constant body temperature is energy expensive – mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet. While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different species have since adapted {{to meet their}} dietary requirements {{in a variety of}} ways. Some eat other animals – this is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants, which contain complex carbohydrates such as cellulose. An herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as granivory (seed eating), folivory (leaf eating), frugivory (fruit eating), nectarivory (nectar eating), gummivory (gum eating) and mycophagy (fungus eating). The digestive tract of an herbivore is host to bacteria that ferment these complex substances, and make them available for digestion, which are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large <b>cecum.</b> Some mammals are coprophagous, consuming feces to absorb the nutrients not digested when the food was first ingested. An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract because the proteins, lipids and minerals found in meat require {{little in the way of}} specialized digestion. Exceptions to this include baleen whales who also house gut flora in a multi-chambered stomach, like terrestrial herbivores.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} {{scenario for}} the progression from a fully functional <b>cecum</b> {{to the current}} human appendix was put forth by Charles Darwin. He suggested that the appendix was used for digesting leaves as primates. It may be a vestigial organ of ancient humans that has degraded to nearly nothing of its original purpose, or evolved {{to take on a}} new purpose over the course of evolution. The very long <b>cecum</b> of some herbivorous animals, such as found in the horse or the koala, appears to support this theory. The koala's <b>cecum</b> enables it to host bacteria that specifically help to break down cellulose. Human ancestors may have also relied upon this system when they lived on a diet rich in foliage. As people began to eat more easily digested foods, they may have become less reliant on cellulose-rich plants for energy. As the <b>cecum</b> became less necessary for digestion, mutations that were previously deleterious (and would have hindered evolutionary progress) were no longer important, so the mutations survived. It is suggested that these alleles became more frequent and the <b>cecum</b> continued to shrink. After millions of years, the once-necessary <b>cecum</b> degraded to be the appendix of modern humans.|$|E
25|$|Three morphotypes of cecal-appendices can be {{described}} among mammals based primarily on {{the shape of the}} cecum: a distinct appendix branching from a rounded or sac-like <b>cecum</b> (as in many primate species), an appendix located at the apex of a long and voluminous <b>cecum</b> (as in the rabbit, greater glider and Cape dune mole rat), and an appendix {{in the absence of a}} pronounced <b>cecum</b> (as in the wombat). In addition, long narrow appendix-like structures are found in mammals that either lack an apparent <b>cecum</b> (as in monotremes) or lack a distinct junction between the <b>cecum</b> and appendix-like structure (as in the koala). A cecal appendix has evolved independently at least twice, and apparently represents yet another example of convergence in morphology between Australian marsupials and placentals in the rest of the world. Although the appendix has apparently been lost by numerous species, it has also been maintained for more than 80 million years in at least one clade.|$|E
25|$|Only 5% {{of large}} {{intestinal}} impactions at referral hospital are involve the <b>cecum.</b> Primary cecal impactions usually consist of dry feed material, with the horse slowly developing clinical signs over several days. Secondary cecal impactions may occur post-surgery, orthopedic or otherwise, and the <b>cecum</b> does not function properly. Horses usually show clinical signs 3–5 days post general anesthesia, including decreased appetite, decreased manure production, and {{gas in the}} <b>cecum</b> which can be auscultated. The <b>cecum</b> quickly distends due to fluid and gas accumulation, often leading to rupture within 24–48 hours if not corrected. This impaction may be missed since decreased manure production can be attributed secondarily to surgery, and often rupture occurs before severe signs of pain. Horses are most at risk {{for this type of}} impaction if surgery is greater than 1 hour in length, or if inadequate analgesia is provided postoperatively.|$|E
25|$|Right dorsal displacement: {{the colon}} moves between the <b>cecum</b> and body wall.|$|E
25|$|Tapirs have simple stomachs and are hindgut fermenters that ferment digested {{food in a}} large <b>cecum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{substrates}} {{utilized by}} the <b>cecum</b> have either passed {{along the entire}} intestine or are biliary excretion products.|$|E
25|$|The {{upper surface}} of the tongue is called the dorsum, and is divided by a groove into {{symmetrical}} halves by the median sulcus. The foramen <b>cecum</b> {{marks the end of}} this division (at about 2.5cm from the root of the tongue) {{and the beginning of the}} terminal sulcus. The foramen <b>cecum</b> is also the point of attachment of the thyroglossal duct and is formed during the descent of the thyroid diverticulum in embryonic development.|$|E
25|$|Binding of bile acids to fiber or {{bacteria}} in the <b>cecum</b> with increased fecal loss from the entero-hepatic circulation.|$|E
25|$|Pancolitis: Involvement of {{the entire}} colon, {{extending}} from the rectum to the <b>cecum,</b> beyond which the small intestine begins.|$|E
25|$|Most sources {{define the}} large {{intestine}} as {{the combination of}} the <b>cecum,</b> colon, rectum, and anal canal. Some other sources exclude the anal canal.|$|E
25|$|The {{enterohepatic}} circulation of bile acids may be altered {{and there is}} an increased flow of bile acids to the <b>cecum,</b> where they are deconjugated and 7alpha-dehydroxylated.|$|E
25|$|The human {{appendix}} {{had been}} proposed to be a vestigial structure, {{a structure that}} has lost {{all or most of}} its original function, or that has evolved to take on a new function. The suggestion was that it is the shrunken remnant of the <b>cecum</b> thought to have been present in a remote ancestor of humans. This notion is still widely held. A 2013 study, however, refutes the idea of an inverse relationship between <b>cecum</b> size and appendix size and presence. Ceca, which occur in the digestive tracts of many herbivores (e.g. ox, horse), house mutualistic bacteria and ingested small stones that help animals digest the cellulose molecules found in plants.|$|E
25|$|Abdominal distention may {{occasionally}} be seen {{in adult}} horses in the flank region, if the <b>cecum</b> or large colon is affected. Foals, however, may show signs of gas within the small intestines with severe abdominal distention.|$|E
25|$|Like horses, {{they have}} a simple stomach, but a large <b>cecum,</b> {{in which they can}} digest tough plant matter. In general, their {{intestines}} have a typical length of about 45 meters, which is unusually long for animals of their size.|$|E
25|$|Over 99% of the {{bacteria}} in the gut are anaerobes, but in the <b>cecum,</b> aerobic bacteria reach high densities. It is estimated that these gut flora have around a hundred times as many genes in total as {{there are in the}} human genome.|$|E
25|$|The {{ascending}} colon {{is the first}} of four sections of the large intestine. It is connected to the small intestine by a section of bowel called the <b>cecum.</b> The {{ascending colon}} runs upwards through the abdominal cavity toward the transverse colon for approximately eight inches (20cm).|$|E
25|$|Tapeworms at the {{junction}} of the <b>cecum</b> have been implicated in causing colic. The most common species of tapeworm in the equine is Anoplocephala perfoliata. However, a 2008 study in Canada indicated {{that there is no}} connection between tapeworms and colic, contradicting studies performed in the UK.|$|E
25|$|A human colon is {{considered}} abnormally enlarged {{if it has}} a diameter greater than 12cm in the <b>cecum</b> (it is usually less than 9cm), greater than 6.5cm in the rectosigmoid region and greater than 8cm for the ascending colon. The transverse colon is usually less than 6cm in diameter.|$|E
25|$|Enlargement of the <b>cecum</b> is {{a common}} finding when some dietary fibers are fed and this is now {{believed}} to be normal physiological adjustment. Such an increase {{may be due to}} a number of factors, prolonged cecal residence of the fiber, increased bacterial mass, or increased bacterial end-products.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{functions}} of the colon is to remove the water and other key nutrients from waste material and recycle it. As the waste material exits the small intestine through the ileocecal valve, it will move into the <b>cecum</b> {{and then to the}} ascending colon where this process of extraction starts. The unwanted waste material is moved upwards toward the transverse colon by the action of peristalsis.|$|E
25|$|The {{appendix}} {{is attached}} to the inferior surface of the <b>cecum,</b> and contains a small amount of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue which gives the appendix an undetermined role in immunity. However, the appendix is known to be important in fetal life as it contains endocrine cells that release biogenic amines and peptide hormones important for homeostasis during early growth and development. The appendix can be removed with no apparent damage or consequence to the patient.|$|E
25|$|Death {{is caused}} by an {{underdeveloped}} part of the digestive system. The large intestine of the horse is a complex system where most digestion takes place, and comprises the <b>cecum,</b> the colon, and the rectum. Necropsies on LWS foals reveal a pale, underdeveloped colon and intestinal obstruction (impaction). Samples of affected tissue show a lack of nerves that allow the intestine to move material through the digestive system, a condition called intestinal agangliosis.|$|E
25|$|While {{the base}} of the {{appendix}} is at a fairly constant location—2cm below the ileocecal valve, the tip of the appendix can be variably located—in the pelvis, outside the peritoneum or behind the <b>cecum.</b> The prevalence of the different positions varies amongst populations with the retrocecal position being most common in Ghana and Sudan, with 67.3% and 58.3% occurrence respectively, in comparison to Iran and Bosnia where the pelvic position is most common, with 55.8% and 57.7% occurrence respectively.|$|E
25|$|Didelphimorphs have a {{plantigrade}} stance (feet {{flat on the}} ground) and the hind feet have an opposable digit with no claw. Like some New World monkeys, opossums have prehensile tails. Like all marsupials, the fur {{consists of}} awn hair only, and the females have a pouch. The tail {{and parts of the}} feet bear scutes. The stomach is simple, with a small <b>cecum.</b> Like most marsupials, the male opossum has a forked penis bearing twin glandes.|$|E

Animals in these species re-ingest their own cecotropes, which consist of chewed plant {{material}} that was metabolized by bacteria in the <b>cecum,</b> a chamber between the small and large intestines. Cecotropes contain digestible carbohydrates and B vitamins synthesized by the resident bacteria.|$|E
