5|$|By 21 March, Syria's entire {{supply of}} mustard agent had been removed. On 27 April, Syria missed its revised 60-day {{deadline}} for <b>complete</b> <b>removal</b> of its full chemical weapons arsenal. As at 23 May, Syria had removed or destroyed 92.5% of its declared chemical stockpile.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shipment}} of components for chemical weapons {{were removed from}} Syria by a Norwegian/Danish flotilla on 7 January 2014. The 31 December deadline for <b>complete</b> <b>removal</b> of priority chemicals had been missed; on 7 January, the New York Times assessed the delay {{was due to the}} difficulty of overland transport of chemical weapons {{in the middle of a}} civil war. A second shipment was removed around 27 January; that same day, the U.N. Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, expressed concern over the worsening delays and assessed that Syria already has the resources required to transport the weapons promptly despite the ongoing civil war.|$|E
5|$|In late 2005, FETA's {{committee}} {{approved a}} proposal for a revamp of the tolls. The minimum toll would be set to the existing £1figure, but would increase dependent on the time of day, rising to a maximum of £4 for evening rush hour travel. All tolls would be halved for cars with more than one occupant, as an incentive to drivers to share cars and make fewer journeys. According to FETA's chairman Lawrence Marshall, the system would provide the most efficiency, claiming that 80% of peak-time journeys are made by single-occupant vehicles. The proposal, passed with the chairman's casting vote after the committee was deadlocked, was referred to the Scottish Executive in December 2005, and implementation planned for October 2007 subject to approval by transport minister Tavish Scott. Environmental groups welcomed the proposal, although local politicians condemned it as simply a means of raising capital. At the same time, a counter-argument was tabled by Fife councillors proposing the <b>complete</b> <b>removal</b> of tolls.|$|E

The purchase from Florida East Coast Railway was acquired using Florida Forever program money.|$|R
5|$|Richard Janko, who {{believes}} that the Catalogue was composed c. 690, argues that {{the extent to which}} Pindar relied upon the Hesiodic text is unknown and that, even if Apollo did carry Cyrene to Libya, this does not presuppose an aetiology of the city. Others have argued that the citation is also vague regarding just which Hesiodic poem included the Cyrene-Ehoie, the Catalogue or the Megalai Ehoiai: the latter might have included a narrative similar to Pindar's, with the former presenting a different version of the myth, if indeed the Catalogue treated Cyrene at all. The <b>complete</b> <b>removal</b> of Cyrene would not, however, be easily accommodated by related evidence—it would presumably also involve transferring two fragments concerning Aristaeus which have traditionally been attributed to the Catalogue, and his son Actaeon certainly appeared in the poem.|$|E
5|$|Universal supports. In a more recent, more convenient, {{and more}} widely used method, the {{synthesis}} {{starts with the}} universal support where a non-nucleosidic linker {{is attached to the}} solid support material (compounds 1 and 2). A phosphoramidite respective to the 3'-terminal nucleoside residue is coupled to the universal solid support in the first synthetic cycle of oligonucleotide chain assembly using the standard protocols. The chain assembly is then continued until the completion, after which the solid support-bound oligonucleotide is deprotected. The characteristic feature of the universal solid supports is that the release of the oligonucleotides occurs by the hydrolytic cleavage of a P-O bond that attaches the 3’-O of the 3’-terminal nucleotide residue to the universal linker as shown in Scheme 6. The critical advantage of this approach is that the same solid support is used irrespectively of the sequence of the oligonucleotide to be synthesized. For the <b>complete</b> <b>removal</b> of the linker and the 3'-terminal phosphate from the assembled oligonucleotide, the solid support 1 and several similar solid supports require gaseous ammonia, aqueous ammonium hydroxide, aqueous methylamine, or their mixture and are commercially available. The solid support 2 requires a solution of ammonia in anhydrous methanol and is also commercially available.|$|E

25|$|Kocher {{and others}} later {{discovered}} that the <b>complete</b> <b>removal</b> of the thyroid could lead to cretinism (termed cachexia strumipriva by Kocher) caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormones. The phenomena was reported to Kocher first in 1874 by the general practitioner August Fetscherin and later in 1882 by Jacques-Louis Reverdin together with his assistant Auguste Reverdin (1848-1908). Reverdin met Kocher on 7 September in Geneva at the international hygienic congress (internationaler Hygienekongress) and expressed his concerns about <b>complete</b> <b>removal</b> of the thyroid to Kocher. Kocher then tried to contact 77 of his 102 former patients and found signs of a physical and mental decay in those cases where he had removed the thyroid gland completely. Ironically, it was his precise surgery that allowed Kocher to remove the thyroid gland almost completely {{and led to the}} severe side effects of cretinism.|$|E
25|$|Suspicious lesions may be cauterized, {{treated with}} laser light or cut with an {{electric}} wire for purposes of biopsy or <b>complete</b> <b>removal</b> polypectomy. Medication can be injected, e.g. to control bleeding lesions. On average, the procedure takes 20–30 minutes, depending on the indication and findings. With multiple polypectomies or biopsies, procedure times may be longer. As mentioned above, anatomic considerations may also affect procedure times.|$|E

40|$|Anal canal {{duplication}} (ACD) is a {{very rare}} condition, especially in adults. Four cases in adults are reported. In three cases, the orifice of duplication was located behind the native anus, and in one case, it was located anteriorly.

25|$|If {{there are}} no symptoms, {{periodic}} observation may be all that is required. Most cases that result in symptoms can be cured by surgery.

Chemotherapy has not {{been found to be}} useful. A small percentage grow rapidly and are associated with worse outcomes.|$|E

25|$|Another early {{technique}} involved <b>complete</b> <b>removal</b> {{of brush}} and woody vegetation from an area. Tsetse tend {{to rest on}} the trunks of trees so removing woody vegetation made the area inhospitable to the flies. However, the technique was not widely used and has been abandoned. Preventing regrowth of woody vegetation requires continuous clearing efforts, which is only practical where large human populations are present. The clearing of woody vegetation has come to be seen as an environmental problem more than a benefit.|$|E
