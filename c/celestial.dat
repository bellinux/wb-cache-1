5|$|One of {{the oldest}} fields in astronomy, and in all of science, is the {{measurement}} of the positions of <b>celestial</b> objects. Historically, accurate knowledge of {{the positions of the}} Sun, Moon, planets and stars has been essential in <b>celestial</b> navigation (the use of <b>celestial</b> objects to guide navigation) and in the making of calendars.|$|E
5|$|The {{collapse}} of the Kingdom of Wei in 260 CE, along {{with the fall of}} Northern China to the Huns in 317, further scattered adherents to the <b>Celestial</b> Master. The <b>Celestial</b> Masters later reemerged in the 4th and 5th centuries as two distinct offshoots, the Northern and Southern <b>Celestial</b> Masters.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecliptic}} forms {{one of the}} {{two fundamental}} planes used as reference for positions on the <b>celestial</b> sphere, the other being the <b>celestial</b> equator. Perpendicular to the ecliptic are the ecliptic poles, the north ecliptic pole being the pole north of the equator. Of the two fundamental planes, the ecliptic is closer to unmoving against the background stars, its motion due to planetary precession being roughly 1/100 that of the <b>celestial</b> equator.|$|E
5000|$|... 18,000 years ago, the <b>Celestials</b> {{returned}} to Earth. The Deviants attacked them, but the <b>Celestials</b> counterattacked, {{resulting in the}} sinking of Mu and Atlantis, and much worldwide havoc. The Eternals helped rescue many humans. An Eternal named Valkin was entrusted by the <b>Celestials</b> with an artifact of great power for safekeeping.|$|R
50|$|When the <b>Celestials</b> {{returned}} {{to judge the}} worthiness of their creations a few years ago, the Eternals found themselves clashing with the Deviants again, and decided to publicly reveal their existence to humanity. Zuras feared {{what would happen if}} the <b>Celestials</b> judged unfavorably. They encountered Thor again, and were attacked by Thor's father Odin and the Olympian gods, who tried to prevent their interfering with the gods' plans to attack the <b>Celestials.</b> Eventually, the Eternals decided to help the gods and formed a Uni-Mind to assist the Destroyer's assault on the <b>Celestials.</b>|$|R
50|$|During {{the last}} {{stand against the}} First Firmament, while Outside of Everything, The Queen of Nevers reveals the reason she had saved the One Above All. By using him as a seed, she rises the <b>Celestials</b> anew as her own Avatars of Possible in what she {{claims to be the}} Fifth Host. The True <b>Celestials</b> then face and defeat the Dark <b>Celestials</b> of the First Firmament.|$|R
5|$|To {{calculate}} what astronomical {{features a}} structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If {{you were to}} go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the <b>celestial</b> pole. This point is +90° if you are watching the North <b>Celestial</b> Pole or −90° if you are observing the Southern <b>Celestial</b> Pole. The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of <b>celestial</b> latitude, known as declination. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the <b>Celestial</b> Poles is the <b>Celestial</b> Equator which has a declination of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending where {{you are on the}} globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern <b>Celestial</b> Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.|$|E
5|$|Apart from meteors {{within the}} {{atmosphere}} and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of <b>celestial</b> bodies in Earth's sky is to the west {{at a rate of}} 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the <b>celestial</b> equator, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.|$|E
5|$|Astrology is {{the study}} of the {{movements}} and relative positions of <b>celestial</b> objects as a means for divining information about human affairs and terrestrial events. Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, and has its roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret <b>celestial</b> cycles as signs of divine communications. Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and some – such as the Indians, Chinese, and Maya – developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from <b>celestial</b> observations. Western astrology, one of the oldest astrological systems still in use, can trace its roots to 19th–17th century BCE Mesopotamia, from which it spread to Ancient Greece, Rome, the Arab world and eventually Central and Western Europe. Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of horoscopes that purport to explain aspects of a person's personality and predict significant events in their lives based on the positions of <b>celestial</b> objects; the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.|$|E
50|$|In {{their very}} first season, the <b>Celestials</b> had four {{different}} managers. Two future {{major league baseball}} players played for them that year as well: Cecil Coombs and Mike Prendergast. Coombs played for them in 1910 as well. In 1911 and 1912, future big leaguers Jim Bluejacket and Patsy McGaffigan played for the <b>Celestials.</b> 1913 is the only year in which no known future big league players played for the <b>Celestials.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ship's A.I. {{was created}} untold millennia {{ago by the}} <b>Celestials</b> as the {{operating}} system for a data collection device.

Bill Moss & the <b>Celestials</b> would perform with acts such as The Staple Singers and Mighty Clouds of Joy at venues such as the Apollo Theater in Harlem. The <b>Celestials</b> {{were one of the}} first gospel groups to use {{electric}} instruments. [...] Their best known songs include [...] "Turn It Over to Jesus", [...] "Everything is Going to be Alright" [...] and [...] "The Way We Use to Have Church." ...|$|R
5|$|Based on the {{theories}} of his predecessors, Zhang Heng systematically developed the <b>celestial</b> sphere theory. An armillary constructed {{on the basis of}} his hypotheses bears a remarkable similarity to Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. However, Zhang Heng did not definitely propose a theoretical model like Ptolemy's earth-centered one. It is astonishing that the <b>celestial</b> model Zhang Heng constructed was almost a physical model of Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. Only a single step separates the <b>celestial</b> globe from the earth-centered theory, but Chinese astronomers never took that step.|$|E
5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the ecliptic plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic. If the equator is projected outward to the <b>celestial</b> sphere, forming the <b>celestial</b> equator, it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses the <b>celestial</b> equator at these points, one from south to north, the other from north to south. The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as the first point of Aries and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the <b>celestial</b> equator. The crossing from north to south is the autumnal equinox or descending node.|$|E
5|$|Edward Grant, a {{historian}} of science, {{has provided evidence}} that medieval scholastic philosophers generally considered the <b>celestial</b> spheres to be solid {{in the sense of}} three-dimensional or continuous, but most did not consider them solid in the sense of hard. The consensus was that the <b>celestial</b> spheres were made of some kind of continuous fluid.|$|E

50|$|When the High Evolutionary {{learned that}} the god-like <b>Celestials</b> were coming to Earth to judge whether {{humanity}} should continue to exist or perish, he—with {{the help of the}} Evolutionaries—systematically began to slaughter his creations, fearing that their unnatural presence may cause the <b>Celestials</b> to deem the planet unworthy.|$|R
5|$|Galileo's {{discovery}} {{proved the}} importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers by showing that there were objects in space to be discovered that until then had remained unseen by the naked eye. More importantly, the discovery of <b>celestial</b> bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a blow to the then-accepted Ptolemaic world system, which held that Earth {{was at the center of}} the universe and all other <b>celestial</b> bodies revolved around it. Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), which announced <b>celestial</b> observations through his telescope, does not explicitly mention Copernican heliocentrism, a theory that placed the Sun at the center of the universe. Nevertheless, Galileo accepted the Copernican theory.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to borrowing deities from the <b>Celestial</b> Masters and the Shangqing School, the Lingbao School also developed its own gods. The supreme god of Lingbao Daoists {{is known as}} the Yuanshi Tianzun or the <b>Celestial</b> Worthy of the Original Beginning, who played a similar role to the deified Laozi in the <b>Celestial</b> Masters. According to the scriptures, this god went through a series of kalpa cycles that were given names similar to dynastic names, until emerging {{at the beginning of the}} Kaihuang period. The next most important god was Laojun, the deified form of Laozi, who was the <b>Celestial</b> Worthy's chief disciple. Below these two main gods in the <b>celestial</b> hierarchy were those deities associated with the Southern Palace, where spirits went after death to prepare for rebirth. The head of this group of gods was known as the Perfected of the Southern Extremities. Beneath him was the Director of the Equerry, who was in charge of the life records of the spirits, and Lord Han, who controlled Fengdu, the city of the dead. Below these principal gods in the Lingbao hierarchy were other deities such as the Five Old Men, the Dragon Kings, and the Demon Kings.|$|E

50|$|In time, Ship took to space, {{responding}} to {{the call of the}} <b>Celestials,</b> with X-Factor unwittingly along for the ride, leaving them temporarily stranded on a planet undergoing its own mutant crisis. The <b>Celestials</b> collected the data Ship had gathered during its stay on Earth and Ship came to realize that Apocalypse had not created it. The <b>Celestials</b> showed it its true origin. Given the choice, the Ship A.I. decided to return to Earth with X-Factor. Upon return from the space journey, Ship landed on-end as a building in Lower Manhattan.|$|R

5|$|Only six Molyneux globes {{are known}} to exist today, two {{terrestrial}} globes and four <b>celestial</b> globes. Three <b>celestial</b> globes are in Germany, one each in Zerbst, Nuremberg (at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum (German National Museum)) and Kassel (Hessisches Landesmuseum (Hesse Museum), Kassel). The Hessisches Landesmuseum once had a 1592 terrestrial globe, but it {{is believed to have}} been destroyed during World War II. Three globes remain in England: one pair, consisting of a terrestrial and a <b>celestial</b> globe, is owned by Middle Temple in London and displayed in its library, while a terrestrial globe is at Petworth House in Petworth, West Sussex.|$|E
5|$|Practicing correct sexual {{practices}} was one method of perfecting the body's internal spirits. The <b>Celestial</b> Masters believed that semen is {{the embodiment of}} qi. If someone ejaculated too often, their life would be shortened. In fact, the Xiang'er indicates that people should not even have sex {{for the purposes of}} reproduction. The <b>Celestial</b> Masters frowned upon the practice of heqi (also known as 'The Union of the Breaths') of not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain', and advocated non-ejaculation simply as a way to avoid losing qi. In addition, the <b>Celestial</b> Masters thought that the method of stealing a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was completely wrong, and should not be practiced. Despite their opposition to 'heqi' and reproductive sex, there is the possibility that the <b>Celestial</b> Masters supported sex for purposes other than reproduction, and a <b>Celestial</b> Master text from around the 5th century describes an elaborate sexual ritual.See Kalinowski(1985) for a full description of the ritual.|$|E

5|$|The {{belief and}} {{practices}} of the Hanzhong <b>Celestial</b> Masters had a profound legacy upon future Daoist belief. The movement marked a significant change from earlier, philosophical Daoist movements. No longer was Daoism a philosophical pastime for the literate and wealthy; it was now promoted to all classes of society, including the illiterate and the non-Chinese. In addition, the <b>Celestial</b> Masters were the first Daoist group to form an organized priesthood that helped spread their beliefs. Being the first organized religious Daoists, the first <b>Celestial</b> Masters are the ancestors of all subsequent Daoist movements such as the Shangqing and Lingbao movements, {{as well as the}} medieval Zhengyi Daoists, who claimed affinity to the first <b>Celestial</b> Masters.|$|E
50|$|One {{thousand}} years ago, the <b>Celestials</b> {{announced that they}} would return in a millennium to judge humanity. The male godheads of the various pantheons agreed to prepare to battle them. Fearing that the <b>Celestials</b> were too powerful, Gaea gathered the female godheads and formed an alternate plan: to prove humanity's worth by choosing 12 individuals, each one representing {{the best of a}} human activity, knowledge, endeavor or talent (such as music or hunting), making them into gods, and putting them into a magical sleep under the Earth, watched over by goddesses (each pantheon taking turns) until the <b>Celestials</b> returned. After a failed attack by the Asgardians, Gaea presented the Young Gods to the <b>Celestials</b> who accepted them, judging that Earth would survive. They then left for space, taking the Young Gods with them to educate them.|$|R
