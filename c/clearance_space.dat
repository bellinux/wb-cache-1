To define {{relationships}} better {{between the}} duration of severe ischemia and microvas-cular functional integrity with an approach potentially applicable to studies in vivo, the effects of 30 and 60 minutes of global, no-flow ischemia on the coronary vascularure of isolated, perfused rabbit hearts were determined.

40|$|Wave rotors {{may play}} a role as topping cycles for jet engines, since by their use, the {{combustion}} temperature can be raised without increasing the turbine inlet temperature. In order to design a wave rotor for this, or any other application, knowledge of the loss mechanisms is required, and also how the design parameters affect those losses. At NASA LeRC, a 3 -port wave rotor experiment operating on the flow-divider cycle, has been started with the objective of determining the losses. The experimental scheme is a three factor Box-Behnken design, with passage opening time, friction factor, and leakage gap as the factors. Variation of these factors is provided by using two rotors, of different length, two different passage widths for each rotor, and adjustable leakage gap. In the experiment, pressure transducers are mounted on the rotor, and give pressure traces as a function of rotational angle at the entrance and exit of a rotor passage. In addition, pitot rakes monitor the stagnation pressures for each port, and orifice meters measure the mass flows.

40|$|LectureAnnular {{clearance}} spaces, such as impeller wearing rings, inter 0 stage {{bushes and}} balance drums in centrifugal pumps, or the fluid-filled clearance around the armature of the submerged motor, at a first glance present {{the appearance of}} very weak journal bearings. The fluid has very low viscosity compared with lubricating oils, and clearances are much larger than in proper journal bearings. Two factors invalidate this deceptive view. Firstly, the Reynold numbers of flows in these spaces are very high, rendering flows turbulent. This greatly increases effective viscosities. Secondly, fluid inertia effects not normally encountered in journal bearings and become basic determining factors of the bearing forces raised by internal clearances of the type indicated. In clearance spaces of centrifugal pumps, the high pressure differences across the clearance spaces bring about a sudden pressure drop owing to acceleration into the space. This converts the <b>clearance</b> <b>space</b> into a powerful hydrostatic bearing. As the journal rotates and vibrates, damping and crossing coupling forces are developed as well as radial stiffness. Here, fluid inertia is significant only in the entry loss effect which controls hydrostatic stiffness. In the submerged motor, where the fine clearance surrounds a large length of shaft, fluid inertia effects in the <b>clearance</b> <b>space</b> itself become dominant. Both types of <b>clearance</b> <b>space</b> alter the synchronous response and stability limits of the rotor (beyond recognition), {{as compared with the}} performance in air. In centrifugal pumps, generally, the internal clearances both raise and damp critical speeds and improve stability margins. There are, however, special circumstances where these clearances become destabilizing elements. In submerged motors, critical speeds are substantially reduced and damped, and the type of destabilization normally associated with circular journal bearings may be encountered. The paper explains these phenomena and illustrates them with simple calculations...|$|E

40|$|Due {{to the hot}} {{and humid}} weather, the {{majority}} of residential units in Hong Kong are equipped with window-type air-conditioners. However, the provisions made in the building envelope design for their installation are often inadequate, particularly in the clearances for intake and disposal of outdoor air for condenser cooling. Consequently, the air-conditioners would consume an unnecessarily high amount of electricity {{and at the same}} time output less cooling. The paper describes a study on the outdoor airflow around air-conditioners in residential buildings and the related thermal phenomena. The CFD code FLUENT was employed to predict the airflow patterns in 20 installation configurations of window-type air-conditioners, which embrace different shapes of clearances around the air-conditioners that are on the same story in a building. The results reveal that insufficient <b>clearance</b> <b>spaces</b> could cause a significant increase in the temperature of the outdoor air entering the air-conditioners, which would also be accompanied by a reduction in the airflow rate. The increase in the electricity consumption of the air-conditioners could exceed 45 % for the case where the air-conditioners were drawing in the discharged hot condenser air from other air conditioners located at an opposite wall for condenser cooling. The presence of a sidewall, however, could cause the discharged hot air to move quicker away from the air-conditioner leading to a lower entering air temperature to its condenser.

The resultant leakage flow was studied under three different conditions, (i) with uniform inlet flow (ii) with non-uniform inlet flow near the gaps (iii) with severely non-uniform inlet flow and an end wall within the gaps. In the first experiment only leakage flows were present. Analytical predictions of blade pressure distributions and induced drag agree fairly well with the experimental values. A semi-theoretical formula for induced drag coefficients is suggested for use by designers. For the range of gap/chord ratios used in practice, leakage produces {{a slight increase in}} the average lift. In the second experiment an interaction between leakage and secondary flows was found to be generally favourable. The leakage and secondary flows are opposite in direction and this results in the angle distribution becoming more uniform and less variation in spanwise pressure distribution. Analytical predictions of outlet angle agree qualitatively with experimental values. The leakage flow was found to have very favourable effects in the third experiment.
