40|$|An {{experiment}} on charcoal gasification for power generation {{was conducted on}} a pilot scale of 7. 5 KVA. This experiment used 50 kg mixed charcoal species having moisture content of 6. 9 %, ash content of 2. 5 %, volatile matter of 22. 4 % and calorific value of 6733 cal/g. The product gas was run through gas purifier, jet <b>condenser,</b> <b>cyclone,</b> gas cooler and filter. The gas was composed of carbon monoxide (26 to 31 %), carbon dioxide (3 to 15 %), methane (0 to 1 %) with calorific values ranging from 2600 to 4100 cal/g. The produce gas which was assumed to have been purified of tar and water vapour was fed into a power generator. The electric power generated ranged from 200 to 234 Volts at around 2. 08 A and a revolution of from 1822 to 2110 RPM. It turned out that these gases still contained tar and water vapour which was observed at the engine, {{an indication that the}} gas purifier did not function weel. This is evidenced by the fluctuation of the gas flow rate (from 9. 8 to 1277 Nm 3 /hour). The efficiency of charcoal conversion to electric and heat energy was 11. 7 % and 60 % respectively for a load of 1. 8 KW and 7 hours of operation, and 13, 9 % and 50. 5 % respectively for a load of 2. 8 KW and 7 hours of operation...|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} {{method of}} calculation {{of the separation of}} polydisperse condensed moisture from a flow of wet steam or air in a vertical cyclone with tangential inlet side of the flow of the working fluid, and histograms of the size distribu-tion is not deposited drops and diagrams of the distribution on the inner wall surface of the cyclone mass flow of the precipitated liquid. It includes gas-dynamic model of the motion of the gas and liquid phases of the working fluid inside the cyclone and the approach implements the idea of spatial and fractional discretization of the separation process. On the basis of calculations of the kinematics of <b>condensed</b> moisture specific <b>cyclones</b> have shown the feasibility of im-proving the accepted system of dehumidification that is associated with the implementation of intermediate wicking devices, their rational placement {{on the surface of the}} shell and setting the optimum constructive sizes...|$|R
