2500|$|A <b>chimney</b> <b>cowl</b> {{is placed}} {{on top of the}} chimney to prevent birds and other animals from nesting in the chimney. [...] They often feature a rain guard to prevent rain or snow from going down the chimney. [...] A metal wire mesh is often used as a spark {{arrestor}} to minimize burning debris from rising out of the chimney and making it onto the roof. Although the masonry inside the chimney can absorb a large amount of moisture which later evaporates, rainwater can collect {{at the base of the}} chimney. Sometimes weep holes are placed at the bottom of the chimney to drain out collected water.|$|E

50|$|On 7 February 1894, 25-year-old Herman Heller (1869-1931) {{founded the}} company „Hermann Heller Handelsgeschäft und Produktion von geschützten Artikeln und Uhrmacherwerkzeug“ - which traded and {{manufactured}} patented products and watchmaker’s tools. Initially, staff comprised seven craftsmen and three apprentices. The company produced machinist vices, <b>chimney</b> <b>cowls,</b> fans and spiral stairs.|$|R
6000|$|When {{the night}} wind howls in the <b>chimney</b> <b>cowls,</b> and the bat in the {{moonlight}} flies, And inky clouds, like funeral shrouds, sail over the midnight skies - When the footpads quail at the night-bird's wail, and black dogs bay the moon, Then is the spectres' holiday - then is the ghosts' high noon! ...|$|R
50|$|In February 1957, the Cape Midland System {{received}} {{its first two}} Class 15F locomotives, transferred from the Cape Western System's Paarden Eiland shed to Sydenham in Port Elizabeth. By July 1957 there were nine at Sydenham, three at Cradock and one at Noupoort. There was a brief period when both Systems were using Class 15Fs on the mainline. On the Midland, several of the locomotives were equipped with <b>chimney</b> <b>cowls</b> from 1960 onwards to ease the smoke nuisance for footplatemen in the many tunnels, but these were of dubious effectiveness.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Brumley's {{thoughts}} on the permanence of landscape and the mutability of human affairs {{were more than a}} little dashed when he came within sight of Black Strand and perceived that once cosily beautiful little home clipped and extended, its shrubbery wrecked and the old barn now pierced with windows and adorned--for its new chimneys were not working very well--by several efficient novelties in <b>chimney</b> <b>cowls.</b> Up the slopes behind Sir Isaac had extended his boundaries, and had been felling trees and levelling a couple of tennis courts for next summer.|$|R

50|$|The railway {{was carried}} mainly on iron viaducts, with a {{corrugated}} iron decking onto which the tracks were laid. It was vulnerable to corrosion, {{especially as the}} steam-operated Docks Railway operated beneath some sections, despite the locomotives being fitted with <b>chimney</b> <b>cowls</b> which were intended to deflect the steam from the structure. Parts of the decking had become rusty on the surface, caused by steam and soot from the dock locomotives that passed underneath, mixing with rainwater to form an acid that began to corrode the metalwork. Drainage blockages combined with grit and constant vibration also {{played a part in}} the degradation of the structure.|$|R
60|$|At {{an attic}} window, from which {{stretched}} a Babylonic wilderness of slated roofs and <b>cowled</b> <b>chimney</b> pots, two girls were sitting. The tan {{of the wind}} and the sun was upon their cheeks, their clothes lacked the cheap smartness of the Londoner. They were both in mourning for their father, Gideon Strong.|$|R
6000|$|Louisa {{laid her}} lesson book [...] On the cold window-sill; And in the sleepy {{sunshine}} house [...] Went softly down, until She {{stood in the}} half-opened door, [...] And peeped. But strange to say, Where Death just now had sunning sat [...] Only a shadow lay: Just the tall <b>chimney's</b> round-topped <b>cowl,</b> [...] And the small sun behind, Had with its shadow in the dust [...] Called sleepy Death to mind. But most she thought how strange it was [...] Two keys that he should bear, And that, when beckoning, he should wag [...] The littlest in the air.|$|R
2500|$|An H-style cap (<b>cowl)</b> is a <b>chimney</b> top {{constructed}} from chimney pipes shaped like the letter H. (Its image {{is included in}} <b>cowl</b> (<b>chimney).)</b> It is an age-old method of regulating draft in situations where prevailing winds or turbulences cause downdraft and backpuffing. Although the H cap has a distinct advantage over most other downdraft caps, it fell out of favor because of its bulky design. It is found mostly in marine use but has been regaining popularity due to its energy-saving functionality. [...] The H-cap stabilizes the draft rather than increasing it. Other downdraft caps {{are based on the}} Venturi effect, solving downdraft problems by increasing the updraft constantly resulting in much higher fuel consumption.|$|R
5000|$|Gordon Holman, {{referring}} to the Landing Barge, Kitchen as an LCK, described it as having [...] "the appearance of a houseboat which somebody had attempted {{to turn into a}} factory. <b>Chimneys,</b> with square <b>cowls</b> on them, rose up {{from all parts of the}} vessel. But when the L.C.K. made smoke nobody complained.” The LBK was meant to be a floating kitchen. It had oil-fired ranges, automatic potato peelers, refrigerated meat lockers, four ovens in the aft end of its kitchen space, storage for bulk and perishable goods forward, and a 10-ton fresh water storage tank housed in the hold with additional fresh and sea water tanks above decks. It could hold sufficient provisions to feed 900 men for a week.|$|R
60|$|Lizzie Hexam and Jenny Wren. For whom, {{perhaps with}} some old {{instinct}} of his race, the gentle Jew had spread a carpet. Seated on it, against no more romantic object than a blackened chimney-stack over which some bumble creeper had been trained, they both pored over one book; both with attentive faces; Jenny with the sharper; Lizzie {{with the more}} perplexed. Another little book or two were lying near, and a common basket of common fruit, and another basket full of strings of beads and tinsel scraps. A few boxes of humble flowers and evergreens completed the garden; and the encompassing wilderness of dowager old <b>chimneys</b> twirled their <b>cowls</b> and fluttered their smoke, rather {{as if they were}} bridling, and fanning themselves, and looking on in a state of airy surprise.|$|R
