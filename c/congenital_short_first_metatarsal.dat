50|$|The name {{derives from}} American {{orthopedic}} surgeon Dudley Joy Morton (1884 - 1960), who originally {{described it as}} part of Morton's triad (a.k.a. Morton's syndrome or Morton's foot syndrome): a <b>congenital</b> <b>short</b> <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> bone, a hypermobile first metatarsal segment, and calluses under the second and third metatarsals.|$|E
40|$|Morton's foot {{syndrome}} is a hereditary syndrome {{characterized by a}} <b>short</b> <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> bone, posterior displacement of the sesamoids, and hypertrophy of the second metatarsal, causing excessive weight to be borne by the second metatarsal head. This condition results in callus formation under the second metatarsal. Pain and tenderness are usually felt {{at the base of}} the <b>first</b> two <b>metatarsal</b> bones and at the head of the second. Pain (metatarsalgia) may be disabling. Conservative treatment consists of placing a flexible pad under the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> and toe to increase the range of motion and weight-bearing along the first metatarsophalangeal joint and the hallux. Surgical treatment consists of removing a small portion of bone from one or two joints to bring the toe down to the desired length. Lengthening short toes by placing a silicon implant into one of the joints is also possible...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to report a new {{technique}} in the treatment of patients first metatarsophalangeal (MTP 1) joint with arthrodesis after a failed Keller arthroplasty. 	A 3 -cm intercalary bone graft, taken from the iliac crest, is used as a salvage procedure for bone-block distraction arthrodesis of the painful shortened MTP joint. Indications are younger patients with a <b>short</b> <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal,</b> cock-up deformity, and associated metatarsalgia of the lesser metatarsals in addition to a painful MTP 1 joint. Using gait analysis preoperatively and postoperatively, a trend to normalization of the load-bearing pattern under the metatarsal heads and toes is observed. Although generally good results are observed, the complication rate is high, mainly because of malunion and non-union. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|Metatarsalgia is {{most often}} {{localized}} to the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> head [...] - [...] the ball of the foot just behind the big toe. There are two small sesamoid bones under the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> head. The next most frequent site of metatarsal head pain is under the second metatarsal. This can be due to either too <b>short</b> a <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> bone or to [...] "hypermobility of the first ray" [...] - [...] metatarsal bone and medial cuneiform bone behind it [...] - [...] both of which result in excess pressure being transmitted into the second metatarsal head.|$|R
30|$|Hallux varus, syndactaly and {{conjoint}} delta <b>first</b> <b>metatarsals</b> are {{the most}} common toe deformities associated with FH that benefit from surgical treatment of the toes. Syndactaly of the first to second toes is easily treated by release and skin grafting. Syndactaly between the middle toes {{does not need to be}} separated. Hallux varus is always associated with a <b>short</b> bracket (delta) <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal.</b> In most cases this is a conjoint <b>metatarsal</b> (fusion of <b>first</b> and second <b>metatarsal)</b> associated with syndactaly of the first and second toes. The treatment for this requires separation of the syndactaly combined with splitting of the conjoint metatarsal into two parts and reorienting of this osteotomy to realign the first metatarso-phalangeal joint surface.|$|R
40|$|Sixteen {{patients}} with duplication of the hallux were re-viewed. Follow-up averaged 21 years. Duplication may be classified into three groups: simple hallucal duplication, a transitional type with a <b>short</b> thick <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal,</b> and complete <b>first</b> ray duplication. Routine {{removal of the}} most medial hallux or ray is to be avoided. Careful preoperative assessment is necessary to compare hallucal function, cosmesis, and metatarsal weightbearing. Surgery should also correct the associated congenital hallux varus. Sur-gical complications include functionless hallucis from in-appropriate selection and medial soft tissue contractures with either recurrence of the hallux varus or the gradual development of a hallux varus interphalangeus. Duplication of the hallux is a relatively rare congenital deformity about which there is limited information. It {{is the purpose of}} this article to offer a classifcation and indicate the surgical management, the associated prob-lems, and the prognosis by means of a long-term follow-up of 16 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixteen patients (10 female and 6 male) were exam-ined and x-rayed. Their prior in-hospital and outpatient x-rays and follow-up records were reviewed. Results were based on patient satisfaction, function, and cos-mesis. Function included residual hallucal function and distribution of metatarsal weightbearing. X-rays were evaluated and correlated with function and cosmesis. Half of the patients were followed by the senior author from the time of initial surgery. The average follow-up was 21 years. The oldest patient seen at follow-up was 46 years. She provided a good control case as she had unilateral hallux excision with bilateral involvement...|$|R
5000|$|Syndesmosis {{procedure}} addresses {{specifically the}} two fundamental problems of metatarsus primus varus deformity that {{gives rise to}} the bunion deformity. They are leaning and instability of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> bone [...] Syndesmosis procedure uprights the leaning <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> bone with strong binding sutures between it and the second metatarsal bone (Fig. 2) and then also stabilizes it uniquely by creating a fibrous connecting bridge between these two bones (Fig. 3,4). <b>First</b> <b>metatarsal</b> bone can be readily realigned is because by definition of the metatarsus primus varus deformity its <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> is abnormally loose and mobile.|$|R
5000|$|In the foot—the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> bone {{usually has}} two sesamoid bones at its {{connection}} to the big toe (both within the tendon of flexor hallucis brevis). One is found on the lateral side of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> while the other is found on the medial side. In some people, only a single sesamoid is found on the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> bone.|$|R
50|$|The <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> bone is {{the bone}} {{in the foot}} just behind the big toe. The <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> bone is the {{shortest}} of the metatarsal bones and by far the thickest and strongest of them.|$|R
40|$|Hallux valgus is an {{acquired}} complex forefoot deformity that consists mainly of valgus deviation {{of the big}} toe and varus position of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal.</b> 2, 14 There are over 100 methods of surgical correction of the deformity, and often, subcapital osteotomies of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> are performed. These procedures are indicated in the young and active peo-ple with mild to moderate hallux valgus deformity. From a variety of methods, {{one of the most}} popular are Kramer’s and Mitchell’s subcapital osteotomies of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal.</b> Mitchell’s method (Figure 1) is a subcapital osteotomy of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal,</b> from a dorsomedial surgical exposure, with correction of hallux valgus deformity by lateral transla-tion of the distal fragment and stabilization by bone suture. 2, 15, 23 The limitation of this technique is shortening of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> and transfer metatarsalgia as a conse...|$|R
50|$|During growth, {{the growth}} plates are located {{distally}} on the metatarsals, {{except on the}} <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> where it is located proximally. Yet it is quite common to have an accessory growth plate on the distal <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} study was undertaken {{to quantify the}} validity, the intra- and interobserver reliability, {{and the effect of}} <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> orientation on the distal metatarsal artic-ular angle (DMAA). <b>First</b> <b>metatarsals</b> from six cadavers were isolated by sharp dissection and attached to a cus-tom-made triplanar protractor. This allowed controlled po-sitioning of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> in the three cardinal planes. Each specimen was moved through a stepwise sequence of <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> orientation changes. Radiographs were taken at each position. The distal (metatarsophalangeal) articular surface of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> was then circum-scribed with metallic paint and the radiographic series was repeated. DMAA measurements were made on each radiograph multiple times by two measurers blinded to the parameters of variation. The difference between the standard (clinical) radiographic technique for estimating the DMAA and the metallic paint DMAA averaged- 0. 9 O (SD = 2. 4 O). Longitudinal rotation (P c.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an operative technique proposed for treating severe Hallux Valgus deformity with arthrosis of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> joint in elderly people. The procedure {{consists of the}} Keller’s arthroplasty in combination with basal osteotomy of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> bone, whereby {{the head of the}} metatarsal is displaced laterally and plantarward. The osteotomy is fixed with a reconstructive plate. The results show a significant improvement in the hallux valgus angle, the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> angle, {{as well as in the}} plantar pressure distribution...|$|R
40|$|Background The scarf {{osteotomy}} is {{a standard}} procedure to correct hallux valgus. Recent modifications in the technique allow for important translations of the bone fragments {{without the need for}} screw fixation. We performed the first prospective analysis of radiographic parameters after a screwless scarf osteotomy. Prospective study of pre- and postoperative standing radiographs of the feet let us quantify angle reduction and shortening, lengthening or lowering of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal.</b> Methods 100 patients undergoing a screwless scarf osteotomy were evaluated radiographically before and after surgery. The 1 - 2 IM angle, HVA, length of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal,</b> protrusion length and height of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> head were measured. Results The mean 1 - 2 IM angle was reduced significantly, to a normal range. The mean reduction of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> length and protrusion length was 0. 3 and 0. 14  cm respectively. The metatarsal head was lowered 0. 3  cm on average. Conclusions A minimal mean reduction of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> length was observed, but it is possible to lengthen the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> if necessary. In 23 % of cases, an increase of protrusion length was obtained. The screwless scarf osteotomy results in a good correction of the 1 - 2 IM angle and HVA. If necessary, plantarisation of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> head could be obtained. Secondary displacement was seen in 1 patient.

5000|$|A <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> bone would lean towards {{one side}} is because “the medial hood {{ligament}} is stretched” [...] and as it becomes weak and incompetent the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> would lose its support and then gradually shift out of place to form the metatarsus primus varus deformity.|$|R
30|$|In the forefoot, {{dorsal bunion}} of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> may occur {{if there is}} {{isolated}} weakness of the peroneus longus muscle, or if the peroneus longus has been transferred without a concomitant transfer of the tibialis anterior muscle from the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> if the latter muscle is functioning.|$|R
40|$|Twelve {{below the}} knee {{amputation}} specimens were ex-amined while a dorsally directed force {{was applied to the}} <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal.</b> Seven specimens were tested with serial removal of soft tissues, followed by cutting the plantar first metatarsocuneiform ligament. Five specimens had only the plantar first metatarsocuneiform ligament cut, leaving the other structures intact. In both groups, dorsal displacement of the distal <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> was noted to be more than 5 mm after sectioning of the ligament, with no marked change noted during removal of other soft tissues. This study demonstrates that the plantar first metatarsocuneiform ligament is the major component in the stabilization of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> during weightbear-ing. The importance of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> in weightbear-ing has long been appreciated, and dorsal displacement of the distal <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> has been noted previously as the source of increased lateral weightbearing and subsequent metatarsal pain. 2, 5, 7, 13, 15 This has usually been {{as a result of a}} displaced or angulated metatarsal fracture, or malunion of an osteotomy of the first meta-tarsal. Surgical procedures have been done to restore the weightbearing role of the distal <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal,</b> including <b>first</b> metatarsophalangeal joint arthrodesis, and osteotomies to restore the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> to its previous weightbearing position. First metatarsocunei-form joint arthrodesis has been reported on by Kwong and Aubauchon, " as well as by Mauldin et al., " for relief of metatarsalgia as well as metatarsus varus. The purpose of this study was to explore the normal ana-tomic structures providing support to the first metatar-sal during its weightbearing function...|$|R

40|$|Background: Hallux valgus {{deformities}} {{with large}} intermetatar-sal angles require a more proximal metatarsal procedure to adequately correct the deformity. Due {{to the relative}} ease of a closing wedge osteotomy, this technique was adopted but with concern over <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> shortening. In this study, we primarily evaluated angular correction and <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> shortening. Materials and Methods: We evaluated 70 feet in 57 patients (average age, 54 years) with 52 female and five male. The average followup was 14 (range, 6 to 45) months. The charts were reviewed {{for the presence of}} metatarsalgia. Digital radiographic measurements were made for pre- and postoperative hallux valgus and intermetatarsal angles, dorsiflexion angle of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal,</b> and absolute and relative shortening of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal.</b> Results: The average hallux valgus angle improved from 31 to 11 degrees (p < 0. 0001) and intermetatarsal angle from 13. 2 to 4. 4 angles (p < 0. 0001). The absolute shortening of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> was 2. 2 mm and relative shortening was 0. 6 mm. There was 1. 3 degrees of dorsiflexion on average. Conclusion: Excellent correction of the deformity with minimal dorsiflexion or new complaints of metatarsalgia was found with this technique. The new method of assessing the relative shortening found to be less than the absolute shortening, which we feel more accurately reflects the functional length of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{measuring}} <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> rotation on weightbearing tangential radiographs is described. Un-der controlled conditions using cadaver specimens, 5 ° changes in <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> rotation {{were associated with}} a mean change in radiographically measured rotation of 5. 4 ° (SO = 1. 7 °). A clinical study of 30 hallux valgus and 30 control patients was undertaken to assess the reli-ability of the method of measurement. The overall reli-ability was high for both hallux valgus and control pa-tients (r = 0. 93 and 0. 95, respectively). In these two groups, no {{significant difference was found}} between the mean values for <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> rotation. Likewise, we found no correlation between <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> rotation measured on tangential standing ("sesamoid " view) ra-diographs and the first metatarsophalangeal angle or the intermetatarsal 1 - 2 angle measured on anteroposterior standing radiographs...|$|R

40|$|Background: Hallux varus {{deformity}} is not fre-quent, {{is usually}} acquired, and is poorly tolerated by patients. A common cause is the resection of an exces-sive {{amount of the}} head of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> during an operation performed to correct a hallux valgus de-formity. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the results of application of bone graft to the medial aspect of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> head in order to restore missing bone after resection of an excessive amount of bone during a bunionectomy. Methods: Of thirty patients who had a hallux varus deformity that was treated operatively, eight (ten feet) had bone-grafting to the medial aspect of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> head.

50|$|Bunions are {{commonly}} associated with a deviated position of the big toe toward the second toe, and the deviation in the angle between the <b>first</b> and second <b>metatarsal</b> bones of the foot. The small sesamoid bones found beneath the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> (which help the flexor tendon bend the big toe downwards) may also become deviated over time as the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> bone drifts away from its normal position. Osteoarthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint, diminished and/or altered range of motion, and discomfort with pressure applied to the bump or with motion of the joint, may all accompany bunion development. Atop of the <b>first</b> <b>metatarsal</b> head either medially or dorso-medially, there can also arise a bursa that when inflamed (bursitis), {{can be the most}} painful aspect of the process.|$|R
