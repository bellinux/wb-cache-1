40|$|Fish {{passage through}} {{culverts}} {{is an important}} consideration in fish bearing streams. Just as adequate culvert capacity is required for safety, adequate provision for fish passage is required to maintain healthy fish populations. The main problem with improperly designed and installed culverts is that they form velocity barriers to fish migrants at the outlet, inlet or through the <b>culvert</b> <b>barrel.</b> If water depths are too low or water velocities at any of these three culvert locations exceed fish swimming ability, fish may be prevented from reaching their spawning grounds. Since hydraulic efficiency and optimum fish passage requirements are mutually exclusive objectives, compromises must be effected that permit adequate fish protection with maximum economy. Such compromises involve the matching of water velocities with fish swimming performance at design discharges that allow limited delay in fish migrations. Migrating fish must negotiate the culvert outlet, the <b>culvert</b> <b>barrel,</b> and the culvert inlet before successfully passing upstream. Hydraulic conditions, such as water velocities and depths, at {{each one of these}} three locations must be suitable for passage at the highest and lowest stream flows expected during fish migration. Fish need to swim continuously for the entire culvert length when no resting opportunities are available. Culvert length and velocities, as well as maximum distance that fish are able to swim, determine whether fish can pass through a culvert once they enter it...|$|E
40|$|A {{two year}} study of fish {{passage through the}} Fish Creek Culvert, located at Mile 132. 2 of the Denali Highway, {{was carried out by}} an {{interdisciplinary}} task force. The purposes of this study were: monitor the interaction of the spawning Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) and the existing culvert, and document variables of watershed hydrology (primarily runoff) and hydraulic behaviour of the culvert that may impact fish passage. In summary, Arctic grayling encountered minimal difficulty in passing upstream through the culvert. The major areas of difficulty for the fish were entering the slightly perched culvert and exiting where nonuniform flow rates of movement through the <b>culvert</b> <b>barrel</b> varied from less than a minute over 80 minutes. Generally, larger fish moved through more rapidly than smaller fish. All fish stayed as close to the boundary of the culvert as possible, and they oriented themselves normal to this boundary; meaning that they were not always swimming in a vertical position...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Presentation date: 1998 - 06 - 19 Because {{of their}} {{potential}} for adversely affecting aquatic resources, increased rates of erosion and sedimentation associated with low-volume forest roads have recently gained the attention of land managers in the Pacific Northwest. For example, on the Tongass National Forest in Southeast Alaska, there is an urgent need to explore the interaction of roads with existing hydrologic and geomorphic processes. The design and maintenance of drainage structures are often of major importance for preventing environmental impacts from forest roads. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the condition of culverts in order to address current maintenance and road closure strategies within the Ketchikan Area of the Tongass National Forest. A total of 671 drainage structures associated with 40 road segments were examined during the summer of 1997. The population of corrugated metal pipes consisted of 552 ditch-relief and 119 stream-crossing structures.

40|$|Potentially important, miscellaneous, {{qualitative}} {{observations of}} four field studies of spawning migrations of arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) through highway culverts are discussed. Problems associated with culvert outlets, inlets, and barrels are described together with observed methods that fish use to negotiate culverts. The importance of location where fish actually swim in culverts is discussed. Limited observations of effects of culvert skew on <b>culvert</b> fish <b>barrel</b> flow patterns indicate such skew can make fish passage less difficult. The necessity of recognizing red muscle and white muscle {{power and energy}} capabilities of fish attempting to pass through culverts is indicated. Observations of fish attempting to to enter a small fish ladder and a difficult culvert indicate that water-produced noise may attract fish to relatively small passage devices. Fish are observed to resort to leaping to enter difficult passage situations...|$|R

40|$|As {{a part of}} the {{research}} program Natural hazards &# 150; Infrastructure for Floods and Landslides (NIFS), the hydraulic performance of the culverts are presently investigated in a scale model study carried out in the NTNU hydraulic laboratory. The background for this model study is the nonexistence of the culvert design guidelines with the sediment effect, and insufficient knowledge on culvert design in steep streams under consideration of sediment transport. The model consists of a collecting reservoir, an approach channel, an expansion section and a culvert system installed in a 45 &# 176; embankment. The approach channel with a slope of 1 : 9 presents a steep stream in which the flow is always supercritical. The purpose of the model is to test the effect of different parameters on the culvert capacity under sediment transport conditions. The test parameters include length and width of the expansion section, inlet geometry, slope of the stream, size and amount of sediments, and the different ways by which sediments approach the culvert (i. e. continuous sediment transport and landslide transport in the stream) and number of the <b>culvert</b> <b>barrels.</b> Recent studies on the model investigated the effect of the length, the width of the expansion section and the slope of the approach channel. The present study focuses on the use of multibarrel culvert system. In each experiment, headwater was measured for different discharge increments, and the results were used to make performance curves or headwater-discharge curves for each parameter. Results showed that the inlet geometry is the most influential parameter on the culvert hydraulic and capacity, and the sediment transport. Both wingwalls inlet and cut inlet gave similar capacity results, but wingwalls inlet presented a more stable flow condition in the expansion section. The ability of these two inlet types to transport sediment was very poor. On the other hand projecting inlet gave a lower capacity but it was able to transport more sediments than the other two inlet types. However, by comparing the results with previous study, it was determined that the increased water level and a flow with reduced energy in the expansion section caused by the energy dissipater blocks was the actual reason for the low sediment transport by wingwalls and cut inlet. Both continuous sediment and landslide transport showed some elevation in headwater results but it was not significant enough to change the capacity of the culvert. However, increased amount and size of the sediment did not give any further significant elevation in the headwater. The main function of the reserve culvert in this multibarrel system was found to be the reduction of the headwater, as it did not have any effect on the pattern of sediment deposition. Sediments were deposited mostly on the centre line. However, in comparison with single barrel system it gave a flow with higher velocity towards the main culvert for the same headwater. The results of this study did not give a complete solution for culvert in steep rivers, but these results can be more helpful in combination with the other studies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Pennsylvania {{contains}} approximately 83, 000 miles (133, 547 km) of {{streams and}} 119, 000 miles (191, 471 km) of public roadways. Fish movement can be impeded by highway culvert designs that create sheet flow or increased current velocity within the <b>culvert</b> <b>barrel,</b> and/or perched outlet conditions. The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation reviewed performance measures of existing culvert designs and conducted a literature review to develop culvert designs that enhance fish passage. Design guidelines were established for pipe culverts and statewide design standards {{have been adopted}} for single cell and twin cell box culverts. Pipe culverts can be depressed at varying depths below streambed elevation depending upon the upstream drainage area and {{the diameter of the}} pipe. Single and twin cell box culverts are depressed twelve inches (305 mm) below streambed elevation. Box culverts installed in waterways with a stream slope less than four percent are constructed with a different baffle design than those installed with stream slopes greater than four percent. Stream flows are directed to the primary cell of the twin cell box culvert structure while the secondary cell is designed only to accept storm flows. All culvert structures are installed parallel to stream gradient and riprap used to protect the inlet and outlet is placed to match the invert elevation of the structure...|$|E
40|$|In Minnesota {{there is}} not a {{standard}} culvert design used at road crossings to improve aquatic organism or fish passage. The design process for fish passage in Minnesota is currently based on the knowledge and experience of local county, state and DNR personnel. The design methodology attempts to maintain the natural stream dimensions, pattern and profile through the culvert crossing. If designed properly aquatic organisms and fish that can make it upstream to the culvert should be able to pass through the culvert. This research was conducted to better understand the hydraulic conditions related to the practice of recessing culverts and other fish passage design elements over a range of landscapes in Minnesota. The design elements analyzed included bankfull width, slope, channel materials, side barrels and recessed culverts. Nineteen culvert sites were survey around the state. The main criterion used to evaluate performance of the culverts was {{the presence or absence of}} adequate sediment in the recessed <b>culvert</b> <b>barrel.</b> Six of the fourteen sites with recessed barrels had no sediment accumulation. A likely reason that these culverts lack sediment was increased velocities due to improper sizing relative to bankfull channel width and the accumulation of sediment in the side barrels. Wider Rosgen “C” type channels also correlated with performance issues related to culvert design. Minnesota Department of Transportation Research Services Sectio...|$|E
40|$|Fish {{passage through}} {{culverts}} {{is an important}} consideration in road and streamcrossing design. Although no comprehensive inventory of culverts on fish-bearing streams in theUnited States is available, {{there are an estimated}} 1. 4 million stream–road crossings. The mostcommon physical characteristics that create barriers to upstream fish passage include excessivewater velocity, insufficient water depth and large outlet drop heights. Over the past decade,interest in the effect of culvert barriers on aquatic systems has grown; accordingly, variouspassage assessment techniques have been used to determine whether a structure is a barrierand under what flow conditions. Recent research has shown that determining the barrier status ofa culvert is not trivial, and that different methods are often not congruent in their classification ofbarriers. The purpose of this research was to test the use of 3 -D hydrodynamic modeling to assesspotential culvert barriers to upstream fish movement. The approach quantified the 3 -D velocityfield within the <b>culvert</b> <b>barrel</b> using computational fluid dynamics. A range of potential pathsthrough the culvert were identified using an algorithm that estimates energy paths, and passagealong the paths was assessed by combining the swim speed–fatigue time relationship with the 3 -D velocity field. Results from the 3 -D approach were compared to an approach that used the 1 -Dvelocity field to estimate passability. Comparisons between estimated passage and measuredpassage showed the 3 -D method more accurately predicted passage through the culvertcompared to the 1 -D method...|$|E
40|$|Several {{computer}} programs {{are available to}} analyze culvert hydraulics, including HY- 8, FishXing, Broken-back Culvert Analysis Program (BCAP), Hydraflow Express, CulvertMaster, Culvert, and Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System (HEC-RAS. The use of slightly different methodologies to complete the analysis results in different estimates for headwater depth, flow control, and outlet velocity. This paper compares the available hydraulic features and tests the accuracy of these seven programs a., {{part of an effort}} to update the HY- 8 program. Four test cases were developed. The flow controls, headwater depths, and outlet velocities were compared with values obtained through calculations based on best practice as outlined in the FHWA publication, Hydraulic Design Series No. 5. Several limitations were identified. BCAP has limited ability to analyze straight <b>barrel</b> <b>culverts</b> operating under outlet control with high tailwater, CulvertMaster reports outlet control for some low discharges as a surrogate for what is referred to as 2 ̆ 2 entrance control, 2 ̆ 2 Culvert misidentifies the location of hydraulic control for lower discharges and overestimates headwater elevations, and HydraFlow Express incorrectly uses critical depth at the outlet for inlet control calculations. With the test cases used here, HY- 8, HEC-RAS, and FishXing most consistently, agreed with accepted empirical results. It is recommended that program providers improve their products to replicate better the hydraulic conditions simulated in this paper and to extend program capabilities to include more environmentally sensitive design considerations such as fish passage...|$|R
40|$|Culverts are {{designed}} and constructed to be hydraulically efficient, {{such that they}} are able to pass flood flows without overtopping the road embankment. Flow passing through a culvert typically experiences an increase in velocity, relative to the approach channel flow, due to reductions in cross-sectional flow area. Increased flow velocity can cause additional outlet erosion as well as be a problem for many types of migratory species. In addition to migratory species, resident fish such as juvenile salmon can also be affected by culverts. Juvenile salmon move up and down streams as population pressures and food sources change. If high velocities in culverts provide barriers to this movement, food sources and population may be limited. Other fish species may have requirements similar to those of juvenile salmon or may require upstream movement for spawning. Research in the area of culvert hydraulics has centered on concrete box culverts and circular corrugated metal pipe culverts. The hydraulic analyses of these culvert types have been well defined for conventional installations, but not for environmentally sensitive and nontraditional culverts. It is desirable to design and construct some culvert crossings to minimize their impact on the natural environment. Culverts are now being designed to maintain natural velocities and minimize turbulence to allow migratory species to pass through the <b>culvert</b> <b>barrel.</b> Such designs may add baffles on the invert, bury the culvert invert, or use bottomless culverts to provide for a natural stream invert. Other designs use larger and wider culverts {{to reduce the amount of}} contraction and acceleration. In order to design these culverts that minimize impacts to the natural stream environment, designers need the associated hydraulic equations and loss coefficients to be evaluated and made more accurate. In NCHRP Project 15 - 24, Utah State University conducted physical, numerical, and computer modeling to refine existing hydraulic relationships and develop new ones for analysis and design of culverts for conventional and nontraditional, environmentally sensitive installations.

40|$|Sedimentation {{frequently}} causes {{an extensive}} blockage in culvert which may reduce its design capacity. Culvert guidelines which are extensively used reveal little details about sedimentation in culvert. Requirement {{of the design}} guidelines for culvert in steep terrain considering sediment transport condition implies the necessity of the culvert guidelines development. Two prior studies of culvert performance on steep terrain have been conducted. The first study evaluated the effects of expansion section length {{on the performance of}} the culvert under jet regime, while the other one investigated the effects of additional roughness installed on the model which then changed the flow regime of the model. Several laboratory experiments have been conducted during this study. The main focus of the study is to investigate the influence of the width of expansion section on the performance of the culvert. Tests were conducted on the scaled model which represents a culvert in a steep terrain. The model is designed for inlet control focusing only on a circular pipe, which consists of an upstream reservoir, an approach channel, and a channel expansion section. Streams on the model are supercritical at the approach channel and subcritical at the expansion section. The experiments simulated performances of the culvert under clear water and sediment transport conditions. The experimental phase was performed with three different inlet setups in various widths of expansion section. In the sediment transport experiments, various sizes and amount of sediments were used and combined with different methods of feeding the sediments. Flow pattern, sediment efficiency, and sediment deposition pattern were observed on the experimental works. The results of the experiments are shown through the inlet control performance curve which represents the ratio of the water depth to the <b>culvert</b> <b>barrel</b> diameter as a function of dimensionless discharge. As the main result, the performance of the culvert under clear water and sediment transport conditions is influenced by the width of expansion section and the inlet setup. In general, narrower width develops better culvert performance. The amount of sediment deposited in the expansion section and its deposition pattern are associated with the phenomena that occur on flows {{as a result of the}} expansion section widths effects. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{aim of this}} {{research}} program {{was to provide a}} better understanding of the hydraulics of embedded culverts. The results of {{this research}} may provide support to improving the methods of culvert installation with respect to fish passage requirements. The overall objective of the research program was to quantify the hydraulic conditions, which included flow depths and velocity distributions, for at-grade and embedded culverts. A physical hydraulic model study was conducted in the Hydrotechnical Laboratory of the Department of Civil and Geological Engineering at the University of Saskatchewan. A culvert with a length of 8 m and a diameter of 500 mm was studied. The culvert slope was set at approximately 0. 75 % for all tests. The tests consisted of a culvert that did not have backfill material or baffle structures placed within the barrel. Only part-full flow conditions were studied. The hydraulic conditions in the model <b>culvert</b> <b>barrel</b> were altered by using three invert placement configurations (at grade, 0. 1 D and 0. 2 D) and three discharges (50 L/s, 70 L/s, and 90 L/s) resulting in nine combinations of culvert invert placement and discharge. For each combination of placement and discharge, the following data were collected along the length of the culvert: velocity distributions within a cross-section of the flow at five locations; vertical velocity profiles along the centerline of the culvert at 10 locations; and flow depths along the centerline of the culvert at 17 locations. From the results of the study, an embedded culvert has lower velocities than an at-grade culvert provided that the culvert diameter, culvert slope and discharge are the same. On the basis of the work done in this study, the mean velocity of the flow field decreased by approximately 15 % when embedding the culvert 0. 1 D and 30 % when embedding the culvert 0. 2 D. When the culvert was placed at grade, on average approximately 44 % of the flow area was less than the mean velocity of the flow. When the culvert was placed at an embedment of 0. 1 D and 0. 2 D, on average approximately 70 % and 98 % of the flow field had a velocity less than the mean velocity of the flow corresponding to the at-grade conditions...|$|E
40|$|Road {{crossings}} that utilize culverts on fish-bearing streams can impede fish {{passage in}} several ways. The most common impediments include large outlet drops, insufficient water depths, and excessive velocity. High velocities {{can act as}} passage barriers, especially for fish that migrate during high-flow periods of the year such as westslope cutthroat trout and Yellowstone cutthroat trout. We performed a basin-wide culvert study to investigate fish passage across a large basin in Montana. A second study (in progress) focused on the velocity component of fish passage. Our basin-wide culvert study was performed in the Clearwater River drainage near Seeley Lake, Montana. Fish species included westslope cutthroat trout, brook trout, brown trout, and bull trout. We studied 46 culverts over a range of culvert types and characteristics. We used a tiered approach to assess fish passage: analysis with FishXing, upstream and downstream population sampling, and direct-passage assessment. Results from the FishXing model from analysis of all 46 culverts indicate 76 to 85 percent are barriers at low flow, depending on the selection of minimum water depth. The upstream and downstream population-sampling analysis of a subset of 21 culverts indicated little or {{no significant difference in}} population characteristics (upstream characteristics compared to downstream characteristics). The direct-passage analysis of a subset of 12 culverts indicated no passage restriction at four culverts, some degree of passage restriction at seven culverts, and no passage at one. Our direct-passage study results may suggest more passage is occurring at low flows than the other methods suggest. The basin-wide study did not address passage issues during high flows. We have embarked on a second study (in progress) to assess this high flow passage with field sites at Mulherin creek, located near the north boundary of Yellowstone National Park. The site is an important spawning tributary for Yellowstone cutthroat trout and rainbow trout. We are using a combination of field studies and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling to assess highvelocity fish passage over a range of flows. Field studies include fish monitoring and detailed velocity mapping using a traditional 1 -D current meter and a 3 -D acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV). We have chosen to monitor direct assessment of fish passage using Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags in individual fish and fixed antennas placed at five culverts and throughout the system. Preliminary results indicate that inlet-velocity patterns can persist through the <b>culvert</b> <b>barrel.</b> Fish movement observations show use of the low-velocity region for passage even at high flows (average barrel velocities at the outlet up to 2. 2 m/s) with passage restricted at times, even though areas of lower velocities exist...|$|E
