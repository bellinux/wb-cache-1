5|$|Langsdorff {{was unwilling}} to risk {{the lives of his}} crew, so he decided to scuttle the ship. He knew that {{although}} Uruguay was neutral, the government was on friendly terms with Britain and if he allowed his ship to be interned, the Uruguayan Navy would allow British intelligence officers access to the ship. Under Article 17 of the Hague Convention, neutrality restrictions limited Admiral Graf Spee to a period of 72 hours for repairs in Montevideo, before she would be interned {{for the duration of the}} war. On 17 December 1939, Langsdorff ordered the destruction of all important equipment aboard the ship. The ship's remaining ammunition supply was dispersed throughout the ship, in preparation for scuttling. On 18 December, the ship, with only Langsdorff and 40 other men aboard, moved into the outer roadstead to be scuttled. A crowd of 20,000 watched as the scuttling charges were set; the crew was taken off by an Argentine tug and the ship was scuttled at 20:55. The multiple explosions from the munitions sent jets of flame high into the air and created a large <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> that obscured the ship which burned in the shallow water for the next two days.|$|E

25|$|Overtaking the disorganized convoy, {{during a}} {{tropical}} squall the next day, Ray fired on two radar contacts scoring hits. When the weather cleared, Ray saw one ship whose stack was going under and whose bow was {{rising from the}} water. The second was enveloped in a <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> and her decks awash. Ray dived deep to escape Japanese patrol aircraft, and the sinking was never confirmed by captured records. As no further suitable contacts were found, the submarine returned to Fremantle, arriving on 14 June.|$|E
25|$|Four days later, she {{contacted}} {{a convoy}} of three ships accompanied by two Fubuki-class destroyers. The submarine scored two hits on the coastal minelayer Nasami, which disappeared in a <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> and debris. The nearer destroyer began closing the range, and Trigger missed it with four aft tubes. She {{caught up with the}} convoy again and fired five torpedoes at the last ship. Two hits produced flames that reached mast height and several secondary explosions that marked the end of the 11,933-ton converted submarine tender Yasukuni Maru. Over three weeks later, the submarine terminated the patrol when she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 23 February.|$|E

25|$|Methanol is {{occasionally}} used to fuel {{internal combustion}} engines. Pure methanol {{is required by}} rule {{to be used in}} Champcars, Monster Trucks, USAC sprint cars (as well as midgets, modifieds, etc.), and other dirt track series, such as World of Outlaws, and Motorcycle Speedway, mainly because, {{in the event of an}} accident, methanol does not produce an opaque <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke.</b> Since the late 1940s, Methanol is also used as the primary fuel ingredient in the powerplants for radio control, control line, free flight airplanes, cars and trucks; such engines use a platinum filament glow plug that ignites the methanol vapor through a catalytic reaction. Drag racers, mud racers, and heavily modified tractor pullers also use methanol as the primary fuel source. Methanol is required with a supercharged engine in a Top Alcohol Dragster and, until the end of the 2006 season, all vehicles in the Indianapolis 500 had to run on methanol. As a fuel for mud racers, methanol mixed with gasoline and nitrous oxide produces more power than gasoline and nitrous oxide alone.|$|E
25|$|The shootout lasted {{at least}} three hours, mainly because the {{property}} was 112 hectares (277 acres) and it allowed for the gunmen to attack from various sides. 42 organized crime members were killed along with a Federal Police officer who was shot while aiding one of his comrades. Of the forty-two organized crime members killed, {{two of them were}} also former municipal police officers in Jalisco. In addition, one Federal Police officer was wounded, while three gunmen were arrested. Eight vehicles, 36 assault rifles, a rocket launcher and several other weapons were seized by police in the shootout. Six of the vehicles, however, were consumed by flames that created a large <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> visible from a distance. The vehicles were burned because of grenades that detonated inside the warehouses where they were parked. Other reports suggested that the gunmen also had stolen fuel tanks close to the vehicles, and that they exploded during the shootout. Once the situation was neutralized, federal agents established several checkpoints in the border regions of Michoacán and Jalisco to tighten security and prevent the mobilization of organized crime groups.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{before midnight}} on 26 April, Trigger {{contacted}} {{a convoy of}} six ships off the eastern Palaus. She fired six torpedoes, from , at four ships that were closely bunched and overlapping. Four hits were seen and heard, with a big explosion on each ship. Suddenly, a terrific explosion blew {{up one of the}} closer ships. One of the more distant ships stood straight up on her bow and sank immediately. At six minutes after midnight, Trigger launched three torpedoes at another group of ships and heard one timed explosion. At 01:57, she launched four torpedoes at a damaged cargo ship and two at an escort. The cargo ship received two more hits. Five minutes later, the submarine fired three stern tubes at a group of three escorts, and the middle one disappeared in a <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke.</b> During the attack, Trigger sank the 11,739ton passenger/cargo ship Miike Maru and heavily damaged the destroyer escort Kasado, the 9,467ton cargo ship Hawaii Maru, and the 8,811ton cargo ship Asosan Maru. Trigger returned to Pearl Harbor on 20 May and four days later, headed for the United States for a major overhaul. She arrived at San Francisco, California, on 31 May and, after overhaul, returned to Hawaii on 11 September.|$|E

500|$|A brief {{flash of}} fire was visible {{to most of}} the ships in the convoy, and for several seconds, only smoke could be seen {{billowing}} from her hold. A few seconds later, a huge pillar of fire shot out of Burke's cargo hold, followed by an immense cloud of white smoke. Within seconds all eyes were drawn to Burke where an enormous fireball erupted as her entire cargo of munitions detonated, instantly destroying the ship and killing her crew of 40 merchant marine sailors and 28 or 29 armed guards. For several seconds, Burke was not visible under an enormous mushroom <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke,</b> fire and explosions. Several ships nearby were damaged by the force of the blast and flying fragments. The shock wave rocked the entire convoy, and several ships reported that they had been torpedoed. [...] A US Army [...] "FS" [...] type ship just aft of Burke was severely damaged by the blast, sinking before it could be identified. As the <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> cleared, nearby ships closed on Burkes former position to search for survivors. [...] It was soon clear that Burke, and all 68 men aboard her, were gone.|$|E

500|$|The Projector had {{a number}} of defects. It was {{difficult}} to move, the tripod had the tendency to damage itself if it was dropped, and its discharge pressure has been described as [...] "feeble." [...] The phosphorus grenades exhibited a number of faults when used in the Projector; they could often explode inside the weapon if too much black powder were added, or fall short if too little were used, or even fail to explode. They could also break inside the barrel when fired which often led to the weapon being damaged and its crew injured. Even when fired properly, the Projector gave off a large <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> which could take up to a minute to clear and revealed the weapon's position. Bishop argues that its anti-tank abilities would have been 'doubtful' when it fired hand and rifle grenades, although he considers that the phosphorus grenades might have been more successful. To make handling easier, a lighter version of the weapon, the Northover Projector Mk 2 was developed in 1941, but few were produced.|$|E
500|$|The live {{performance}} that was uploaded to YouTube was captured at the Gold Country Casino in Orville, California on May 30, 2007. The song was, at the time, unreleased and was performed using banjos and violins and contained different lyrics than the album version. [...] "Sparks Fly" [...] was the opening {{song of the}} Speak Now World Tour. The performance begins with an opening montage about how people should [...] "speak now" [...] about how they feel, and Swift then raises from a <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> and sings [...] "Drop everything now" [...] before starting the actual song performance. Swift also uses a longer interlude into the final chorus of the song. Fireworks were also used during the performance. The performance uses electric guitars instead of banjos and was released on Swift's first live album, Speak Now World Tour Live. In his review of Speak Now World Tour Live, Matt Bjorke of Roughstock cited Swift's perforation of [...] "Sparks Fly" [...] a standout during the concert. Swift has also performed the song at the CMA Music Festival. Before beginning the performance Swift walked through the crowd to the stage and began singing.|$|E
