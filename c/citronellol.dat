2500|$|Other {{than being}} grown for their beauty, {{species such as}} P.graveolens are {{important}} in the perfume industry and are cultivated and distilled for their scents. Although scented pelargoniums exist which have smells of citrus, mint, pine, spices or various fruits, the varieties with rose scents are most commercially important. Pelargonium distillates and absolutes, commonly known as [...] "scented geranium oil" [...] are sometimes used to supplement or adulterate expensive rose oils. The oils of the scented pelargoniums contain <b>citronellol,</b> geraniol, eugenol, alpha pinene and many other compounds.

Scented-leafed pelargoniums {{can be used to}} flavor jellies, cakes, butters, ice cream, iced tea and other dishes, The rose-, lemon- and peppermint-scents are most commonly used. Also used are those with hints of peach, cinnamon and orange. Commonly used lemon-scented culinary species include P.crispum and P.citronellum. Rose-scenteds include P.graveolens and members of the P.graveolens cultivar group. Other species and cultivars with culinary use include the lime-scented P.‘Lime’, the lemon balm-scented P.‘Lemon Balm’, the strawberry-lemon-scented P.‘Lady Scarborough’ and the peppermint-scented P.tomentosum.|$|E

50|$|Isoprenoid monoterpens {{are present}} in grape, above all acyclic linalool, geraniol, nerol, <b>citronellol,</b> homotrienol and {{monocyclic}} α-terpineol, mostly occurring as glycosides. Carotenoids accumulate in ripening grape berries. Oxidation of carotenoids produces volatile fragments, C13-norisoprenoids. These are strongly odoriferous compounds, such as β-ionone (aroma of viola), damascenone (aroma of exotic fruits), β-damascone (aroma of rose) and β-ionol (aroma of flowers and fruits). Tetrahydro-β-carbolines are indole alkaloids occurring in grape to a low amount and contributing to its antioxidant power. Melatonin, an alkaloid, has been identified in grape.|$|E
50|$|Myrcene is an {{important}} intermediate used in the perfumery industry. It has a pleasant odor, but is rarely used directly. It is also unstable in air, tending to polymerize.

It is thus more highly valued as an intermediate for the preparation of flavor and fragrance chemicals such as menthol, citral, <b>citronellol,</b> citronellal, geraniol, nerol, and linalool. Myrcene is converted to myrcenol, another fragrance found in lavender, via uncatalyzed hydroamination of the 1,3-diene followed by hydrolysis and Pd-catalyzed removal of the amine.|$|E

50|$|Buffering agents {{may be used}} {{to prevent}} acid-labile {{protecting}} groups from being removed during chromium(VI)-amine oxidations. However, buffers will also slow down oxidative cyclizations, leading to selective oxidation of alcohols over any other sort of oxidative transformation. <b>Citronellol,</b> for instance, which cyclizes to pugellols in the presence of PCC, does not undergo cyclization when buffers are used.(6)Oxidative cyclization can be used to prepare substituted tetrahydrofurans. Cyclization of dienols leads to the formation of two tetrahydrofuran rings in a syn fashion.(7)Enones can be synthesized from tertiary allylic alcohols through the action of a variety of chromium(VI)-amine reagents. The reaction is driven by the formation of a more substituted double bond. (E)-Enones form in greater amounts than (Z) isomers because of chromium-mediated geometric isomerization.(8)Suitably substituted olefinic alcohols undergo oxidative cyclization to give tetrahydrofurans. Further oxidation of these compounds to give tetrahydropyranyl carbonyl compounds then occurs.(9)In addition to the limitations described above, chromium(VI) reagents are often unsuccessful in the oxidation of substrates containing heteroatoms (particularly nitrogen). Coordination of the heteroatoms to chromium (with displacements of the amine ligand originally attached to the metal) leads to deactivation and eventual decomposition of the oxidizing agent.|$|E
