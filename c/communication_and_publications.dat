However, in 2015, the country repealed the ordinance, marking a defeat for the organization.|$|E
40|$|Human biospecimens {{are subject}} {{to a number of}} {{different}} collection, processing, and storage factors that can significantly alter their molecular composition and consistency. These biospecimen preanalytical factors, in turn, influence experimental outcomes and the ability to reproduce scientific results. Currently, the extent and type of information specific to the biospecimen preanalytical conditions reported in scientific publications and regulatory submissions varies widely. To improve the quality of research utilizing human tissues it is critical that information regarding the handling of biospecimens be reported in a thorough, accurate, and standardized manner. The Biospecimen Reporting for Improved Study Quality (BRISQ) recommendations outlined herein are intended to apply to any study in which human biospecimens are used. The purpose of reporting these details is to supply others, from researchers to regulators, with more consistent and standardized information to better evaluate, interpret, compare, and reproduce the experimental results. The BRISQ guidelines are proposed as an important and timely resource tool to strengthen <b>communication</b> <b>and</b> <b>publications</b> around biospecimen-related research and help reassure patient contributors and the advocacy community that the contributions are valued and respected...|$|E
40|$|Almost 20 million {{hectares}} of the world's rice land are planted to upland or dryland rice. But yields are low, accounting for only 5 % of world production, and modern technology has scarcely affected such production. Because research on upland rice has been limited, the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) recently requested all its associated research centres to increase such activities {{and to develop}} a global strategy for upland rice improvement. In response to this appeal, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) initiated an upland rice training programme whose coordinators subsequently produced a comprehensive digest of upland rice research and production based on existing information and their own extensive experience.

The scientific communication market is described in terms of main driving forces and their interplay. These forces are the actor (author/reader), accessibility, content, and applicability pairs.

The introduction of these forces and functions allows a structural analysis of the scientific communication market and allows us to discuss aspects of structural continuity in, e. g., describing the transformation from a paper-based system to communication in a digital environment.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{transformation}} of the familiar, linear scientific information chain into an interactive scientific communication “network” in response to concomitant changes in scientific research and education. Societal conditions are seen to lead worldwide to the concept of strategic research: research dominated by "economy of scope". Strategic research leads to transnational research enterprises - universities and other research institutions - with a focus on return of research capital investment, and thus on intellectual capital. This development calls for new ways of knowledge management that in turn has consequences for scientific communication. The scientific communication market is described in terms of four main forces and their interplay. These forces are the actors (the author/reader pair), accessibility, content, and applicability. Scientific communication is described in terms of its four functions: registration, awareness, certification and archive. These forces and functions allow a structural analysis of the scientific communication market and allow to discuss aspects of structural continuity in e. g. describing the transformation from a paper-based system to communication in an electronic environment. The developments in research are seen to emphasise the already existing autonomous development of a "unified archive". Also these developments lead us to review certification policies to include elements external to research and to consider new structures for <b>communication,</b> <b>and</b> <b>publications.</b> The new structures are a result of the interactions in the market as described by the forces and the functions.
