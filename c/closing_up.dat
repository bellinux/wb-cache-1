5|$|Buemi {{moved back}} ahead of Conway {{in the battle}} for fifth, while Lotterer was impeded by an LMP2 and LMGTE car at Becketts corner and Webber was delayed by the two {{vehicles}} at Stowe corner. Jarvis came across the two slower cars at Copse corner and narrowly held off an overtaking manoeuvre from Dumas. The Audi moved across the track at Becketts corner upon coming across more slower traffic. Webber caught Lotterer and after <b>closing</b> <b>up</b> to him through Club corner. While lapping Rossiter, Webber moved {{to the front of the}} race heading into Abbey corner. Webber began to pull away from Lotterer. Jarvis was delayed by Rossiter, allowing Dumas to attack but went into grass on the Wellington straight. After making contact Bruno Senna overtook Rusinov driving into Maggots corner for second place in LMP2. The first round of pit stops began after 37 minutes with Derani making a pit stop, promoting Senna into the LMP2 lead. Jarvis was the first of the overall leaders to make a pit stop for fuel and tyres and was followed by teammate Lotterer one minute later. Dumas and both Toyota cars made stops with Jani taking over from Dumas and Kamui Kobayashi switched positions with Conway. Webber stopped one lap later and Hartley climbed aboard the No. 1 Porsche.|$|E

25|$|Turvey had energy {{management}} problems and was overtaken by both Audi Sport ABT cars of di Grassi and Abt on lap four. Prost closed up to Turvey and passed him for eighth place shortly afterwards. Heidfeld continued to gain positions, passing the Andretti cars of Félix da Costa and Frijns {{to move into}} twelfth place. Rosenqvist was lapping four seconds faster than his teammate Heidfeld and both drivers were instructed by their engineers over the radio to lift and coast for energy preservation. Heidfeld used much of his electrical energy to draw closer to d'Ambrosio. Engel set the race's fastest lap on lap seven, completing a circuit in one minute and 9.519 seconds, earning him one championship point. Shortly afterwards, Buemi, di Grassi and Abt were announced as {{the winners of the}} second FanBoost vote. Tyre rubber started to accumulate within the outer limits of the track's barriers, causing one driver to make contact with the wall. By the 13th lap, Heidfeld was <b>closing</b> <b>up</b> to Evans for the first points-scoring position of tenth. Upfront, Rosenqvist and Buemi had pulled away from López with the two leading drivers separated by one second. López was being challenged by teammate Bird for third position but the latter had difficulty in overtaking him.|$|E
25|$|The race {{restarted}} {{at the end}} of lap {{three with}} Rosenqvist being forced to defend first place from Lynn after losing fraction in his tyres from driving behind the safety car. Lynn steered to the outside of Rosenqvist going into Lisboa corner and turned in to take over the lead. Félix da Costa overtook Auer for third on the run up to Mandarin Oriental bend, and Auer lost a further place to Marciello at Lisboa turn. Auer then crashed heavily into the barriers at San Francisco bend while defending from Derani, ending his race early. Shortly after Jones hit a bump going off the racing line at Fisherman's Bend and made contact with the wall. Yellow flags were waved in the area but were withdrawn after he was removed from the circuit. Up front Lynn continued to lead Rosenqvist while Félix da Costa was being hounded by Marciello for third. Similarly King was battling Sims for fifth with Coletti, Buller and Ocon running in close formation in a battle for sixth. Mason was handed a drive-through penalty after his team started his engine while stationary in the fast lane of the pit lane. Sims managed to get ahead of King for fifth and began <b>closing</b> <b>up</b> to Derani. Buller overtook Coletti while Sainz passed Korjus for eleventh. On the fifth lap and heading towards Lisboa corner, Marciello moved in front of Félix da Costa for third.|$|E

25|$|Evans {{recorded}} the race's fastest lap on lap 16, completing a circuit {{in one minute}} and 10.224 seconds, earning him one championship point. Entering the pit stop phase, Rosenqvist reduced di Grassi's lead to three-tenths of a second after the latter locked his tyres. Di Grassi lifted and coasted early, enabling Rosenqvist to take advantage and passed him for the lead around the inside heading into the first corner on lap 22. The mandatory pit stops for drivers to change into their second cars began {{at the end of}} the same lap when the top three drivers entered the pit lane. Rosenqvist rejoined the track in the lead with di Grassi second and Heidfeld third. Abt fell behind Prost in seventh while Bird lost three positions to emerge in eighth position. Félix da Costa and Frijns's strategy did not work and emerged at the back of the field. While di Grassi elected to hold back on using FanBoost to attack Rosenqvist, Buemi continued to move up the running order by passing Abt for eighth position and began <b>closing</b> <b>up</b> to Bird. Despite gaining positions after the pit stops, Vergne was investigated for being released into the path of Dillmann. Heidfeld started to draw closer to di Grassi with fifteen laps left in the race. Buemi moved ahead of Bird for seventh place around the inside of turn nine by braking later than he did.|$|E
25|$|Phil {{clashes with}} Sharon when she {{continually}} puts her work at The Albert before their relationship, {{only beginning to}} become more involved with the bar when she is unimpressed at his {{lack of interest in}} her work. <b>Closing</b> <b>up</b> one night after an event, two men break in and vandalize the bar, and when Sharon attempts to defend herself alone, she is severely beaten and left for dead. She is later hospitalised with a ruptured spleen, leaving Phil distraught, but he later admits to Shirley that he arranged for the men to scare Sharon at the bar, but believed the bodyguards that he hired for her would have protected her, and did not realise that she would be hurt. When Shirley confesses she still loves Phil, he spurns her advances and instead proposes marriage to Sharon after she regains consciousness. Unaware of Phil's role in her attack, Sharon accepts, but she later overhears the truth and begins plotting against him with Marcus Christie's (Stephen Churchett) help. However, she later changes her mind and asks Marcus to return all Phil's money to his accounts, unaware that Phil has seen them. After meeting with his accountant, Phil is angry and tells Shirley what he has discovered only for their conversation to turn to passion. However, Phil later decides that since Sharon is returning the money, it should not matter to him as he still wants to go through with the wedding. They later marry, but are oblivious to Shirley's bitterness, as she attempted to persuade him to be with her, rather than Sharon, only hours before the wedding. After the reception, Shirley enters their house and confronts them, leaving Sharon devastated when she realises Phil has been cheating behind her back even after he asked her to marry him. However, she decides that she still loves Phil and wants to be with him. After Phil insults Shirley and makes hurtful remarks about the fling they had together, an enraged Shirley attempts to go for him, but Sharon stops her, and after a brief struggle, Phil is accidentally shot. He is then rushed to hospital, Shirley fleeing {{with the help of her}} aunt, Babe Smith (Annette Badland). When Ronnie discovers her gun was used after Shirley stole it, Ronnie asks Jay and Ben to dispose of it.|$|E
500|$|In 1806, Charles {{issued a}} new guide for army and unit tactics. The main {{tactical}} innovation was {{the concept of}} the [...] "mass", an anti-cavalry formation created by <b>closing</b> <b>up</b> the spacing between ranks. However, Austrian commanders disliked the innovation and rarely used it unless directly supervised by Charles. Following the failures at Ulm and Austerlitz, the Austrians went back to using the six-companies-per-battalion model, abandoning the four-company-per-battalion that had been introduced by Mack on the eve of war in 1805. Problems persisted despite the reforms. The Austrians lacked sufficient skirmishers to successfully contend with their French counterparts, the cavalry was often sprinkled into individual units throughout the army, preventing the shock and hitting power evident in the French system, and even though Charles imitated the French corps command structure, leaders in the Austrian military establishment were often wary of taking the initiative, relying heavily on written orders and drawn-out planning before they came to a decision.|$|E

500|$|The Maratha cannonade punched {{holes in}} the British line, but the {{infantry}} maintained a steady pace, <b>closing</b> <b>up</b> the gaps in their ranks as they advanced.

The four battalions of Madras infantry {{to the right of the}} 78th, accompanied by the Madras Pioneers, reached Pohlmann's line shortly afterwards and attacked in the same fashion. The gunners stood by their cannon but were no match for the bayonets of the British and Madras troops who swiftly pressed on towards the Maratha infantry. However, instead of meeting the charge, the Maratha right broke and fled northwards towards the Juah, causing the rest of the southern half of the line to follow. The officers of the Madras battalions temporarily lost control as the sepoys, encouraged by their success, pushed too far in pursuit. Maratha cavalry momentarily threatened to charge but were checked by the 78th who remained in order and re-formed to face the danger.|$|E
