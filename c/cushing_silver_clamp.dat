30|$|The {{electrical}} {{properties of the}} obtained structures were investigated in both DC and AC regimes. The electrical parameters of the samples were measured experimentally with standard techniques. The electrical current flowed through the structures in the direction perpendicular to their surfaces. The current–voltage characteristics (CVC) were measured using AFM tip which was positioned on the PS surface or GO surface plate. Impedance spectroscopy of the experimental samples was performed using R, L, C measuring device E 7 - 20 (Belarus) at the room temperature in the frequency range of 25  Hz– 1  MHz. In this case, <b>silver</b> <b>clamping</b> contacts with the diameter of 3  mm were used.|$|R

40|$|By {{means of}} a silver chain {{attached}} to a silver ring around the main renal artery, intermittent renal arterial occlusion, up to 30 minutes daily, was practiced {{for as long as}} 5 months in unilaterally nephrectomized dogs. This did not result in the development of persistently elevated blood pressure. Persistent moderate constriction of the renal artery of such animals by a <b>silver</b> <b>clamp,</b> after intermittent temporary occlusion had failed to affect the blood pressure, produced the usual rise of blood pressure, without accompanying significant impairment of renal excretory function. When the renal artery accidentally became persistently constricted to a great degree, or actually occluded, or if occlusion was deliberately produced by continuous pulling of the chain, hypertension and renal insufficiency (the malignant phase) quickly developed. The results do not lend support to the view that brief daily periods of renal ischemia from intrarenal vasospasm, or from any other cause, can produce persistent hypertension of renal origin...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} communication (1) a method was described {{for the production}} of persistent elevation of blood pressure in dogs by constriction of the main renal artery with a special <b>silver</b> <b>clamp</b> devised for the purpose. It was found that elevation of systolic blood pressure followed constriction of only one renal artery and that, after a varying period, this tended to return to a lower or even to the original level. In more recent experiments elevated systolic blood pressure has lasted as long as 7 months in a dog with only one renal artery constricted. This dog is still living, so it is not known whether or not the other kidney is normal. Following adequate constriction of both renal arteries, the blood pressure has remained elevated in most of the dogs, and some have now had hypertension for more than 4 years. The development of hypertension in dogs with experimental renal ischemia has now been amply confirmed by others (2 - 14). In most of the studies either systolic blood pressure alone or mea...|$|R
40|$|Foreword: Tigerstedt and Bergman {{discovered}} in 1898 the pressure-raising substance from saline rabbit kidney extracts {{and called the}} extract renin, however other scientists could not confirm their findings and in 1934, Harry Gold blatt published his results obtained in dog experiments where he clamped one or both renal arteries with a <b>silver</b> <b>clamp.</b> Numerous attempts showed no increases in plasma renin levels in patients with essential hypertension or that renin had any significant physiologic action of its own in humans. Braun-Menendez discovered that renin acted enzymatically on angiotensinogen (plasma protein) to form angiotensin I (inactive) and is further hydrolysed by converting enzyme to form angiotensin II (vasoconstrictor), which increases the blood pressure when it is low. This is the old dog and because renin is not even mentioned in the JNC-VII (US) and the ESH (European) guidelines and when one do a renin profiling on patients/participants and apply the laragh method to individualize the type of hypertension (volume or renin), {{it is evident that}} renin plays a large role in the maintenance of normal blood pressure and hypertension. In South African blacks whose hypertension is not under control. this will have a large impact on individualizing specific pathology and treatment and this will give the old dog new bite...|$|R
40|$|In 1934, {{pathologist}} Harry Goldblatt {{established the}} first animal model of hypertension. This model provided researchers {{with the tools}} to delineate the renin-angiotensin system of blood pressure control and, eventually, to design enzyme inhibitors {{for the treatment of}} chronic hypertension. As early as the mid– 19 th century, physicians had noted that patients with kidney disease and those with long-term high blood pressure (hypertension) both had enlarged heart muscles. The first clue to this kidney–hypertension connection came from physiologists Robert Tigerstedt and Per Bergman who injected kidney extracts into rabbits, thus triggering a dramatic rise in blood pressure. In a prophetic explanation, they suggested that the kidneys produced a soluble protein— they called it renin—that triggered a rise in blood pressure (1). A little help from man’s best friend Decades later, the duo’s results prompted attempts to provoke hypertension by stressing or injuring the kidneys of animals. None were successful until Harry Goldblatt arrived on the scene. Goldblatt had noted a characteristic narrowing of the renal blood vessels in patients who had died of hypertension. He reasoned that a decreased blood flow, and thus oxygen supply, to the kidneys (ischemia) might somehow trigger hypertension. To test this idea, Goldblatt partially constricted the major renal arteries of dogs using a self-styled adjustable <b>silver</b> <b>clamp.</b> Partial constriction of both renal arteries resulted in a reproducible and persistent rise in blood pressure, in the absence of overt renal failure. Clamping other large arteries—splenic or femoral— had no effect, indicating that hypertension resulted specifically from kidney ischemia. Goldblatt published these result...|$|R

In compound 1, two types of Ag- 4 units are linked by organic ligands to form a three-dimensional supramolecular framework. Compound 2 also shows a 3 D network structure based on [Ag 4 O 2] six-membered rings. Compounds 3 and 6 are both 2 D 44 -sql nets, in which Ag- 4 units and Ag- 6 units are observed, respectively. In compound 4, the npa ligand adopts a mu(5) -eta(1) :eta(1) :eta(1) :eta(2) mode to link zigzag Ag- 4 subunits (SBUs), giving a 2 D network. Compound 5 shows a 1 D infinite <b>silver</b> chain <b>clamped</b> by the opa ligands. In 7, six coordinated Ag(I) ions propagate to an infinite 1 D silver strap and the 2, 3 -dmpyz and tma ligands link the silver strap into a 3 D framework.

40|$|Our {{purpose was}} to {{quantify}} 36 inorganic chemical elements in aerosols from disposable electronic cigarettes (ECs) and electronic hookahs (EHs), {{examine the effect of}} puffing topography on elements in aerosols, and identify the source of the elements. Thirty-six inorganic chemical elements and their concentrations in EC/EH aerosols were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, and their source was identified by analyzing disassembled atomizers using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Of 36 elements screened, 35 were detected in EC/EH aerosols, while only 15 were detected in conventional tobacco smoke. Some elements/metals were present in significantly higher concentrations in EC/EH aerosol than in cigarette smoke. Concentrations of particular elements/metals within EC/EH brands were sometimes variable. Aerosols generated at low and high air-flow rates produced the same pattern of elements, although the total element concentration decreased at the higher air flow rate. The relative amount of elements in the first and last 60 puffs was generally different. Silicon was the dominant element in aerosols from all EC/EH brands and in cigarette smoke. The elements appeared to come from the filament (nickel, chromium), thick wire (copper coated with <b>silver),</b> brass <b>clamp</b> (copper, zinc), solder joints (tin, lead), and wick and sheath (silicon, oxygen, calcium, magnesium, aluminum). Lead was identified in the solder and aerosol of two brands of EHs (up to 0. 165 μg/ 10 puffs). These data show that EC/EH aerosols contain a mixture of elements, including heavy metals, with concentrations often significantly higher than in conventional cigarette smoke. While the health effects of inhaling mixtures of heated metals is currently not known, these data will be valuable in future risk assessments involving EC/EH elements/metals...|$|R
50|$|Ideally, {{heat sinks}} {{are made from}} a good thermal {{conductor}} such as silver, gold, copper, or aluminum alloy. Copper and aluminum are among the most-frequently used materials for this purpose within electronic devices. Copper (401 W/(m·K) at 300 K) is significantly more expensive than aluminum (237 W/(m·K) at 300 K) but is also roughly twice as efficient as a thermal conductor. Aluminum has the significant advantage {{that it can be}} easily formed by extrusion, thus making complex cross-sections possible. Aluminum is also much lighter than copper, offering less mechanical stress on delicate electronic components. Some heat sinks made from aluminum have a copper core as a trade off. The heat sink's contact surface (the base) must be flat and smooth to ensure the best thermal contact with the object needing cooling. Frequently a thermally conductive grease is used to ensure optimal thermal contact; such compounds often contain colloidal <b>silver.</b> Further, a <b>clamping</b> mechanism, screws, or thermal adhesive hold the heat sink tightly onto the component, but specifically without pressure that would crush the component.|$|R

50|$|Heading into 2008, the Silver Stars were {{regarded}} as a premiere contender and did not disappoint. After an average start, the Stars seized control of the Western Conference and rode to {{the best record in}} the West, and the #1 seed in the playoffs. In the first round, the Silver Stars once again faced off against the Sacramento Monarchs. Unlike 2007, the Stars won Game 1 on the road, 85-78. But the Monarchs would prove pesky, spoiling a potential clinch in Game 2 crushing the Silver Stars at home 84-67. Now the Silver Stars had to win game 3 or face an offseason of disappointment. In the Game, the Silver Stars would secure a 14-point lead and it seemed over. But a late rally by the Monarchs, including the last seven points in regulation, sent the game into overtime. In overtime, the <b>Silver</b> Stars <b>clamped</b> down and proved they were the better team, defeating the Monarchs 86-81, advancing to the Western Conference Finals for the second season in a row. In the West Finals, the Stars faced the resurgent Los Angeles Sparks team. In Game 1 in LA, the Stars took an early lead, but an 11-0 run by the Sparks into the half changed the tempo of the game and the Sparks took Game 1 85-70. In Game 2, the Silver Stars blew a 14-point lead in the final quarter, as the Sparks took a one-point lead with 1.3 seconds left. The Stars season was over unless there would be a miracle. Fortunately for the Stars, Sophia Young delivered with a 14-foot turnaround shot to lift the Silver Stars to a 67-66 game 2. It came down to Game 3, with a trip to the WNBA Finals on the line. The two teams battled down the stretch, but the stellar play of Becky Hammon, who had 35 points and 4 crucial free throws, would lift the Silver Stars to their first WNBA Finals, defeating the Sparks 76-72. In the WNBA Finals, the Silver Stars faced the Detroit Shock, who were making their third WNBA Finals appearance in a row. In Game 1 at home, the Silver Stars fell behind early, but would tie the game at 69 with 2:15 left in the 4th quarter. But from there the Shock took control once again and won the game 77-69.|$|R
