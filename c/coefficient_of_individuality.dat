40|$|Background: Biological {{variation}} {{data for}} free plasma amino acids are lacking {{from the more}} comprehensive databases. Therefore, we determined the intra- and inter-individual components of variation in healthy subjects. These data were used to define desirable goals for imprecision, bias and total error, indices <b>of</b> <b>individuality</b> and reference change values. Methods: Plasma samples were collected from 11 volunteers at weekly intervals over 5 weeks. Free plasma amino acids were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC and analytical and biological variation data were derived using ANOVA. Results: Intra-individual <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> variation ranged from 9. 5 % to 46. 4 %, with lower values among the essential amino acids. The mean inter-individual <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> variation was 46. 6 % and was higher than intra-individual values for all amino acids. Thus, indices <b>of</b> <b>individuality</b> were below 0. 8. Reference change values ranged from 30. 9 % to 128. 4 % and total error values ranged from 15. 2 % to 61. 0 %. Conclusions: Plasma amino acids exhibit relatively low intra-individual <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> variation, with essential amino acids showing tighter homeostatic control. Analytical quality goals can be reasonably achieved with current methods. Reference intervals are of limited value in the detection of unusual results in an individual. Therefore, comparison of serial results {{by means of the}} reference change values is recommended. Clin Chem Lab Med 2010; 48 : 99 – 104. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The main porpose of {{this paper}} is to clarify some {{problems}} <b>of</b> <b>individuality</b> in education, focusing upon the relation <b>of</b> <b>individuality</b> to generality (universality). Individuality or individual development is often set up as an aim of education and so was it in Japan just after the World War II. But the individuality principle is now taken only as the individualisation of teaching-learning process. And it is of great importance to build up the scientific conception and theory of the indivivdality-formation and education. The following sub-themas are discussed; a. the concept <b>of</b> <b>individuality</b> b. the connection between individuality and generality (universality) c. individuality as a socio-historical product d. the present situation <b>of</b> <b>individuality,</b> alienation <b>of</b> <b>individuality.</b> Individuality is understood as an individual modification of universality by the individual in the socio-historical backgrounds, and it is alienated in the present society as K. Marx said. But right here lies the important role of education...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Personalized {{ranges of}} liver {{fibrosis}} serum biomarkers such as FibroTest or hyaluronic acid {{could be used}} for early detection of fibrotic changes in patients with progressive chronic liver disease. Our aim was to generate reliable biological variation estimates for these two biomarkers with confidence intervals for within-subject biological variation and reference change value. Design and methods: Nine fasting healthy volunteers and 66 chronic liver disease patients were included. Biological variation estimates were calculated for FibroTest in healthy volunteers, and for hyaluronic acid in healthy volunteers and chronic liver disease patients stratified by etiology and liver fibrosis stage. Results: In healthy volunteers, within-subject biological <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> variation (with 95 % confidence intervals) and index <b>of</b> <b>individuality</b> were 20 % (16 %- 28 %) and 0. 6 for FibroTest and 34 % (27 %- 47 %) and 0. 79 for hyaluronic acid, respectively. Overall hyaluronic acid within-subject biological <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> variation was similar among non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and chronic hepatitis C with 41 % (34 %- 52 %) and 45 % (39 %- 55 %), respectively, in contrast to chronic hepatitis B with 170 % (140 %- 215 %). Hyaluronic acid within-subject biological <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> variation were similar between F 0 -F 1, F 2 and F 3 liver fibrosis stages in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with 34 % (25 %- 49 %), 41 % (31 %- 59 %) and 34 % (23 %- 62 %), respectively, and in chronic hepatitis C with 34 % (27 %- 47 %), 33 % (26 %- 45 %) and 38 % (27 %- 65 %), respectively. However, corresponding hyaluronic acid indexes <b>of</b> <b>individuality</b> were lower in the higher fibrosis stages. Conclusion: Non-overlapping confidence intervals of biological variation estimates allowed us to detect significant differences regarding hyaluronic acid biological variation between chronic liver disease subgroups.

40|$|The present {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} a developmental account {{of the problem of}} the ontological status <b>of</b> <b>individuality</b> as manifested initially in the metaphysical thought of Aristotle and subsequently developed by Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, and Francis Suárez. The philosophical context for the problem <b>of</b> <b>individuality</b> 2 ̆ 7 s ontological status is set by the theme, prominent in Greek philosophy, of unity as a mark of what is most real and most perfect. The historical precedent for viewing individuality as fitting under this theme, and thus as having ontological importance, is provided by Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s doctrine of primary substance, which characterizes individuality as a type of unity that pertains to the most fundamental aspects of reality such as this man or this horse. Though this doctrine highlights the ontological primacy of individual entities, the specific issues <b>of</b> where <b>individuality</b> fits on the ontological map, and what role it plays in constituting substances, are discussed only indirectly by Aristotle. These matters remain mostly unaddressed until the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, in which individuality becomes a focal point of philosophical discussion due to the integration of Aristotelian metaphysical thought into Christian doctrine and the accompanying recognition <b>of</b> <b>individuality</b> as a topic of critical importance. The problem <b>of</b> <b>individuality</b> 2 ̆ 7 s ontological status can be summarized in terms of two questions. First, what kind <b>of</b> thing is <b>individuality,</b> i. e., where does it fit on the ontological map? Second, how is individuality related to the other metaphysical aspects of a thing, such as their form, common nature, etc. ? Aquinas 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of this problem reveals strong roots in the Aristotelian doctrines of substance and of unity as a transcendental attribute of being. Scotus 2 ̆ 7 s account likewise is developed {{in the context of the}} aforementioned Aristotelian notions, but is more extensive than Aquinas 2 ̆ 7 s and more suggestive <b>of</b> <b>individuality</b> 2 ̆ 7 s importance given Scotus 2 ̆ 7 s identification of metaphysics as the science of the transcendentals and <b>of</b> <b>individuality</b> as a transcendental. Suárez 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of the ontological status <b>of</b> <b>individuality</b> builds upon these notions, synthesizing the insights of his predecessors to formulate an account that is more explicit, more precise, and in many ways more rigorous than his predecessors 2 ̆ 7 accounts...|$|R

However, in recent years, we can see some works trying to find the {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>Individuality</b> in WATSUJI's theory. The purpose of this study is an examination <b>of</b> <b>Individuality</b> by WATSUJI Tetsuro, and a grasp of this value in his ethics.

In conclusion, he consistently understood that Individuality is formed in the in-betweenness of person and person, and made a point of its preservation and completion. He stressed the importance <b>of</b> <b>Individuality,</b> especially in the theory of love in “ Rinrigaku. ” He considered not only the spirit but also the Human Body as an Individuality, and paid attention to its irreplaceable oneness. The Individuality, which is contained in a Human Body is changing through a human being's life. In other words, Individuality will not be completed, and WATSUJI accepted this transformation. His ideas <b>of</b> <b>Individuality</b> is on the assumption from the theory of betweenness. However we can analyze the individuality in his ethics because he found that the only Individuality at Human Body that everyone has is unique and changes constantly...|$|R

40|$|Summary: The pre-{{analytical}}, {{analytical and}} biological sources of variation were estimated for serum lipo-protein(a) concentrations, as {{measured with a}} new commercially available procedure. There {{were no significant differences}} between the concentrations of lipoprotein(a) measured in EDTA plasma and serum. The analyte is stable in specimens stored for up to two weeks in the refrigerator, or up to three months at — 20 °C. Fasting is not essential before the lipoprotein(a) determination. Data on analytical (between-run <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> variation < 15. 7 %), within-subject (8. 6 %) and between-subject variation (85. 8 %) were used to calculate the analytical goal for imprecision (< 4. 3 %), the critical difference between serial values from an individual that represents a significant change (36. 3 %), the number of specimens which should be collected to estimate the homeostatic value for an individual to within + 5 % (26), and to establish the marked <b>individuality</b> <b>of</b> lipoprotein(a) (index <b>of</b> <b>individuality,</b> 0. 1) ...|$|R
