5|$|Although Thảo's last plot failed, his {{activities}} in 1965 {{and the resultant}} infighting led {{to a series of}} internal purges within the ARVN. Amid the instability, the Vietcong made strong gains across the country throughout the year. In response to the deteriorating military situation, the Americans began to deploy <b>combat</b> <b>troops</b> to South Vietnam in large numbers.|$|E
5|$|Berger later {{claimed that}} he had come {{up with the idea of}} SS <b>combat</b> <b>troops</b> wearing {{camouflage}} jackets from his own hunting days, and had suggested it to SS-Obergruppenführer Sepp Dietrich, commander of the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler Regiment (LSSAH). From 1938, various forms of Flecktarn camouflage were issued. The author Adrian Weale doubts Berger's account.|$|E
5|$|The Pentagon Papers {{opined that}} Mecklin {{understood}} {{the pitfalls of}} a military junta that Krulak and Mendenhall had overlooked. Regardless, Mecklin concluded that the US should proceed in fostering a regime change, accept the consequences, and contemplate the introduction of US <b>combat</b> <b>troops</b> to stop a possible Viet Cong victory.|$|E

5|$|The bombing {{prompted}} {{debate within}} the administration of United States President Lyndon B. Johnson. Most of his advisers favored retaliatory bombing of North Vietnam {{and the introduction of}} American <b>combat</b> <b>troops,</b> while Johnson preferred the existing strategy of training the Army of the Republic of Vietnam to protect South Vietnam from the Vietcong. In the end, Johnson decided not to take retaliatory action.|$|E
5|$|By 1959, the 559th had 6,000 {{personnel}} in two regiments alone, the 70th and 71st, not including <b>combat</b> <b>troops</b> in security roles or North Vietnamese and Laotian civilian laborers. In {{the early days}} of the conflict the trail was used strictly for the infiltration of manpower. This was due to the fact that Hanoi could supply its southern allies much more efficiently by sea.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the airstrike, Diệm became hostile towards the American {{presence}} in South Vietnam. Diệm claimed that the American media was seeking to bring him down and he introduced new restrictions on press freedom and political association. The media speculated that the United States would use the incident to justify the deployment of <b>combat</b> <b>troops</b> to South Vietnam in the event the U.S. remained circumspect. Domestically, the incident was reported to have increased plotting against Diệm by his officers.|$|E
50|$|Each {{of the two}} Stand Off Combat Company has a Close <b>Combat</b> <b>Troop</b> {{identical}} {{to those in the}} Close Combat Companies. It also was organised to have an Anti-Tank Troop with 6 MILAN anti-tank weapons and a Heavy Machine Gun troop with 6 0.5in Heavy Machine Guns.|$|R
50|$|In March 1951 {{the base}} was renamed 'Donaldson Air Force Base' and on 26 June, the Eighteenth Air Force was {{activated}} in 1951 to discharge Tactical Air Command's troop carrier responsibilities.

50|$|In {{attempts}} to <b>combat</b> <b>troop</b> and supply movement {{along the trail}}, the CIA and US military set up heat and movement sensors along the trail to track enemy movement.

5|$|Before {{and during}} the summit US {{president}} George W. Bush, British prime minister Tony Blair, Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper and Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende made a plea to European NATO members to make more troops available for deployment in Afghanistan, remove the national caveats (i.e. national restrictions on how, when and where forces can be used) and start sending its troops into the conflict-ridden south of the country. According to Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) General James L. Jones {{it was not the}} lack of <b>combat</b> <b>troops</b> and the caveats were the problem, but the lack of adequate helicopters and military intelligence to support airlift and on-the-ground operations.|$|E
5|$|During {{the days}} after the landing, the ground forces secured the Jacquinot Bay area. AIB {{personnel}} manned an outpost to warn of the approach of Japanese forces, while the <b>combat</b> <b>troops</b> patrolled and established positions near the main landing area. On 6 November the company from the 1st New Guinea Infantry Battalion was moved by landing craft to the northern shore of Jacquinot Bay, and subsequently guarded the tracks leading to this area. This unit later relieved the AIB of responsibility for maintaining some of its positions to the east of Jacquinot Bay. During this period the 14th/32nd Battalion remained near the landing area, though one of its companies gradually established an outpost between 8 and 12 November.|$|E
5|$|For much of {{its first}} century, {{enrollment}} at Texas A was restricted to white men {{who were willing to}} participate in the Corps of Cadets and receive military training. During this time, a limited number of women were allowed to attend classes but forbidden from gaining a degree. During World War I, 49% of A graduates were in military service, and in 1918, the senior class was mustered into military service to fight in France. During World War II, Texas A produced over 20,000 <b>combat</b> <b>troops,</b> contributing more officers than both the United States Military Academy and United States Naval Academy combined.|$|E

5|$|When I Airborne Corps was {{committed}} to action in Operation Market Garden in September 1944, Browning's rift with Brereton had severe repercussions. Browning {{was concerned about the}} timetable put forward by Major-General Paul L. Williams of the IX Troop Carrier Command, under which the drop was staggered over several days, and not to make two drops on the first day. This restricted the number of <b>combat</b> <b>troops</b> available on the first day. He also disagreed with the British drop zones proposed by Air Vice Marshal Leslie Hollinghurst of No. 38 Group, which he felt were too distant from the bridge at Arnhem, but Browning now felt unable to challenge the airmen.|$|E
5|$|Advance {{elements}} of the 24th Infantry were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on 5 July, the first encounter between American and North Korean forces. For the first month after the defeat of Task Force Smith, 24th Infantry was repeatedly defeated and forced south by superior North Korean numbers and equipment. The regiments of the 24th Infantry were systematically pushed south in engagements around Chochiwon, Chonan, and Pyongtaek. The 24th made a final stand in the Battle of Taejon, where it was almost completely destroyed but delayed North Korean forces until July 20. By that time, the 8th Army′s force of <b>combat</b> <b>troops</b> were roughly equal to North Korean forces attacking the region, with new UN units arriving every day.|$|E
5|$|After {{his early}} {{release from prison}} for {{political}} crimes in 1924, over {{the second half of}} the 1920s, Gandhi continued to pursue swaraj. He pushed through a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in December 1928 calling on the British government to grant India dominion status or face a new campaign of non-co-operation with complete independence for the country as its goal. After his support for the World War I with Indian <b>combat</b> <b>troops,</b> and the failure of Khilafat movement in preserving the rule of Caliph in Turkey, followed by a collapse in Muslim support for his leadership, some such as Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh questioned his values and non-violent approach. While many Hindu leaders championed a demand for immediate independence, Gandhi revised his own call to a one-year wait, instead of two.|$|E

50|$|It {{is worth}} noting that Peoples Liberation Army, a guerrilla army {{fighting}} the government, have a 30% female participation quota for their combat forces, and frequently claim 40% actual participation. A proposal of a 40% female <b>combat</b> <b>troop</b> quota in the future Nepal Army has been frequently forwarded publicly by Maoist leaders during their peace negotiations with the current government.|$|R
5|$|Australian {{forces were}} at times {{involved}} in heavy fighting, and significant actions included Operation Anaconda in 2002 and Operation Perth in 2006, {{as well as}} actions in Chora in 2007, Kakarak in 2009, the Shah Wali Kot and Derapet in 2010, and Doan in 2011; although others {{have yet to be}} publicly acknowledged due to operational security requirements. Casualties include 41 killed and 256 wounded, while another Australian also died serving with the British Army. Four Australians have been awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia, the first such decorations in forty years. Following a drawdown in forces, the last <b>combat</b> <b>troops</b> were withdrawn on 15 December 2013; however, approximately 400 personnel remain in Afghanistan as trainers and advisers, and are stationed in Kandahar and Kabul. Over 26,000 Australian personnel have served in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|In late December 1943 Hyakutake and {{the other}} senior Japanese {{officers}} on Bougainville concluded that the Allies {{did not intend to}} advance from their perimeter at Empress Augusta Bay or land elsewhere on the island, and began planning a counterattack. These plans were based around a mistaken assessment that there were only 30,000 Allied personnel on the island, of whom only 20,000 were <b>combat</b> <b>troops</b> with the remainder aircraft ground crews; the American combat strength was actually over 60,000. As a result of its experiences in the Guadalcanal Campaign during 1942 and 1943, the 17th Army planned a major attack against the perimeter rather than a series of offensives. During a visit to Bougainville on 21January 1944, General Hitoshi Imamura, the commander of the Eighth Area Army, directed that the offensive should be launched in early March.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, U.S. ground forces were {{introduced}} into combat roles in large numbers, {{and the first}} US Marines came ashore at Da Nang in Thi's I Corps. The flamboyant Thi organized for the American troops to be greeted by military bands, welcoming banners and teenage girls who garlanded them with flowers. This caused embarrassment to US military officials who felt the introduction of <b>combat</b> <b>troops</b> and resultant American casualties would not be received well by the public when contrasted with Thi's celebratory fanfare. Soon after the Americans were in position, Thi tipped off Marine Lieutenant General Lewis W. Walt about a major movement of Việt Cộng insurgents near Chu Lai in Quảng Trị Province near the border with North Vietnam. This resulted in Operation Starlite, generally regarded as the first offensive action undertaken by the Americans in the Vietnam War. Occurring between 18–24 August, it resulted in the 1st Việt Cộng Regiment being pushed to the coast.|$|E

5|$|The Joint Communique was not {{implemented}} {{and the situation}} continued to deteriorate, particularly after the Ngô family ordered South Vietnam's Special Forces to attack Buddhist pagodas across the country on 21 August. The U.S. condemned the raids, and began to cut aid to the Special Forces, which was effectively a private Ngô family army, {{in addition to other}} government programs that were closely identified with the ruling clan. Regarding such gestures as a green light, and safe in the knowledge that the US would not intervene in Diệm's defense, the army staged a successful coup in November, resulting in the assassination of the president. The removal of Diệm resulted in a period of political instability, as a series of military juntas deposed one another. This led to a deterioration in the military situation as the communist Viet Cong made substantial gains against the ARVN, prompting the US to deploy hundreds of thousands of <b>combat</b> <b>troops</b> in 1965, escalating the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|The Russian Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C³I) {{performed}} poorly {{during the}} conflict. The Russian communication systems were outdated, with a 58th Army commander allegedly making {{contact with his}} <b>combat</b> <b>troops</b> via a journalist-owned satellite phone. Without the modern GLONASS, precision-guided munitions could not be used; the US-controlled GPS was unavailable, since the war zone was blacked out. Due to the negligence of Russian defence minister, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles was not authorised; an RIA Novosti editorial said that Russian forces lacked reliable aerial-reconnaissance systems, once using a Tupolev Tu-22M3 bomber instead. However, Russian reconnaissance battalions and regiments were also deployed during the war. General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, deputy chief of the General staff, said that during the war, new weapons were not tried out.|$|E
5|$|The communists {{moved out}} to take the Plain of Jars again in 1967. Laotian {{victories}} were {{few and far between}} {{and by the end of}} the year the situation had become critical, even with the support provided by the American and Laotian Air Forces. PAVN, having a complete understanding of the American military system, began to attack TACAN facilities. U.S. intelligence indicated that between December 1967 and August 1968, the combined strength of PAVN and Pathet Lao forces increased from about 51,000 to over 110,000. The PAVN contingent comprised an estimated 34,000 <b>combat</b> <b>troops,</b> 6,000 advisors, and 18,000 support troops. On 6 December Lima Site 44 was overrun and on the 25th PAVN forces captured Lima Site 61, the site of a mobile facility. All of these attacks were part of a coordinated effort to reduce the ability of the Americans to strike the communist logistical system during the Tet Offensive.|$|E

The U.S. Eighth Army, Seventh Air Force, and U.S. Naval Forces Korea are stationed in South Korea. The two nations have strong economic, diplomatic, and military ties, although they have at times disagreed with regard to policies towards North Korea, and with regard to some of South Korea's industrial activities that involve usage of rocket or nuclear technology. There had also been strong anti-American sentiment during certain periods, which has largely moderated in the modern day.|$|R
