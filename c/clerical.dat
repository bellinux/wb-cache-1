5|$|After his {{successful}} surgery, Ramanujan {{searched for a}} job. He stayed at a friend's house while he went from door to door around Madras looking for a <b>clerical</b> position. To make money, he tutored students at Presidency College who were preparing for their F.A. exam.|$|E
5|$|Allen, Messori, and Plunkett also {{state that}} accusations that Opus Dei is secretive are unfounded. These accusations {{stem from a}} <b>clerical</b> {{paradigm}} which expects Opus Dei members to behave as monks and clerics, people who are traditionally known and externally identifiable as seekers of holiness. In contrast, these journalists continue, Opus Dei's lay members, like any normal Catholic professional, are ultimately responsible for their personal actions, and do not externally represent the organization which provides them religious education. Writer and broadcast analyst John L. Allen, Jr. states that Opus Dei provides abundant information about itself. These journalists have stated that the historic roots of criticisms against Opus Dei {{can be found in}} influential <b>clerical</b> circles.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{returning}} to Brazil, PedroII was faced with an unexpected crisis. The Brazilian clergy had long been understaffed, undisciplined and poorly educated, leading to a great loss {{of respect for the}} Catholic Church. The imperial government had embarked upon a program of reform to address these deficiencies. As Catholicism was the state religion, the government exercised a great deal of control over Church affairs, paying <b>clerical</b> salaries, appointing parish priests, nominating bishops, ratifying papal bulls and overseeing seminaries. In pursuing reform, the government selected bishops who satisfied its criteria for education, support for reform and moral fitness. However, as more capable men began to fill the <b>clerical</b> ranks, resentment of government control over the Church increased.|$|E
5|$|The final elected {{member of}} the South Bend {{government}} is the City Clerk, {{who is responsible for}} maintaining official city records and providing general <b>clerical</b> assistance to the City Council.|$|E
5|$|The {{sacrament of}} Holy Orders consecrates and deputes some Christians {{to serve the}} whole body as members of three degrees or orders: episcopate (bishops), presbyterate (priests) and diaconate (deacons). The Church has defined rules on who may be ordained into the clergy. In the Latin Church, the priesthood is {{generally}} restricted to celibate men, and the episcopate is always restricted to celibate men. Men who are already married may be ordained in certain Eastern Catholic churches in most countries, and the personal ordinariates and may become deacons even in the Western Church (see <b>Clerical</b> marriage). But after becoming a Catholic priest, a man may not marry (see <b>Clerical</b> celibacy) unless he is formally laicised.|$|E
5|$|Albert Downing {{was born}} on 12 July 1886 in Port Ahuriri, Napier, New Zealand, the eldest son of Mr and Mrs John Downing. He {{attended}} Napier Boys' High School until 1904. He was a farmer before joining Barry Brothers, carriers and coal merchants, choosing {{to work as a}} carter outdoors, rather than join the <b>clerical</b> staff. Later, he worked as a storeman for the Ellison and Duncan Company.|$|E
5|$|Article {{five of the}} Constitution {{declared}} Catholicism to be {{the state}} religion. However, the clergy had long been understaffed, undisciplined and poorly educated, all of {{which led to a}} general loss of respect for the Catholic Church. During PedroII's reign, the Imperial government embarked upon a program of reform designed to address these deficiencies. As Catholicism was the official religion, the Emperor exercised a great deal of control over Church affairs and paid <b>clerical</b> salaries, appointed parish priests, nominated bishops, ratified papal bulls and supervised seminaries. In pursuing reform, the government selected bishops whose moral fitness, stance on education and support for reform met with their approval. However, as more capable men began to fill the <b>clerical</b> ranks, resentment of government control over the Church increased. Catholic clerics moved closer to the Pope and his doctrines. This resulted in the Religious Question, a series of clashes during the 1870s between the clergy and the government, since the former wanted a more direct relationship with Rome and the latter sought to maintain its oversight of church affairs.|$|E
5|$|Ecgbert {{wrote the}} Dialogus ecclesiasticae institutionis, {{which was a}} legal code for the clergy, setting forth the proper {{procedures}} for many <b>clerical</b> and ecclesiastical issues including weregild for clerics, entrance to <b>clerical</b> orders, deposition from the clergy, criminal monks, clerics in court, and other matters. It survives as one complete manuscript, with a few excerpts in other manuscripts. Because Ecgbert was the senior archbishop in England {{after the death of}} Nothhelm in 739, {{it is possible that the}} Dialogus was intended not just for the Northumbrian church but for the entire church in England. The Dialogus details a code of conduct for the clergy and how the clergy was to behave in society. The exact date it was composed is unclear, but it was probably after 735, based on the mention of the archiepiscopal status of Ecgbert in one title as well as the internal evidence of the work. The historian Simon Coates saw the Dialogus as not especially exalting monks above the laity.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong's Civil Service, {{created by}} the British colonial government, is a {{politically}} neutral body that implements government policies and provides public services. Senior civil servants are appointed based on meritocracy. The territory's police, firefighting and customs forces, as well as <b>clerical</b> officers across various government departments, make up the civil service.|$|E
5|$|Hugh's {{register}} of ordinations still survives, {{and is in}} the Lincoln cathedral archives. Parts of this were published by Alfred Gibbons in 1888, and others in 1904 by the Canterbury and York Society. These records give not only the name of the person receiving a benefice, but what the <b>clerical</b> status of each new benefice holder was.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, 18.7% of Stretford's {{population}} was {{middle class and}} 19.7% working class compared to 14% middle class and 36% working class nationally. The rest of the {{population was}} made up of <b>clerical</b> workers and skilled manual workers. By 1971, the middle class in Stretford had declined steadily to 14.9% whilst the working class had grown to 31.3% compared to 24% middle class and 26% working class nationally.|$|E
5|$|Monastic reform {{inspired}} {{change in}} the secular Church. The ideals that it was based upon {{were brought to the}} papacy by Pope Leo IX (pope 1049–1054), and provided the ideology of the <b>clerical</b> independence that led to the Investiture Controversy in the late 11th century. This involved Pope Gregory VII (pope 1073–85) and Emperor Henry IV, who initially clashed over episcopal appointments, a dispute that turned into a battle over the ideas of investiture, <b>clerical</b> marriage, and simony. The emperor saw the protection of the Church as one of his responsibilities as well as wanting to preserve the right to appoint his own choices as bishops within his lands, but the papacy insisted on the Church's independence from secular lords. These issues remained unresolved after the compromise of 1122 known as the Concordat of Worms. The dispute represents a significant stage {{in the creation of a}} papal monarchy separate from and equal to lay authorities. It also had the permanent consequence of empowering German princes at the expense of the German emperors.|$|E
5|$|Nepotism is {{a common}} feature {{in the history of}} governance, {{particularly}} in cultures where identity and loyalty are determined more {{at the level of the}} family than that of the nation-state. The use of nephews, rather than direct descendants, is a product of the tradition of <b>clerical</b> celibacy within the Catholic Church, although hereditary descent from uncles to nephews is also seen in the patriarchate of the Assyrian Church of the East.|$|E
5|$|Nigel died on 30 May 1169. In either 1164 or in 1166, or {{possibly}} both, {{he had been}} struck by paralysis, and after this {{he seems to have}} withdrawn from active affairs. He took little part in the disputes between the king and Thomas Becket, although he did agree with his fellow bishops who opposed the king's attempt to reduce <b>clerical</b> benefits. He may have been buried at Ely, where a 12th-century marble slab possibly marks his tomb.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{residents}} {{include the}} theologians John Hulse (1708–1790) {{who founded the}} Hulsean lectures at Cambridge University, and Theophilus Lindsey (1723 OS – 1808) who inspired the Feathers Tavern Petition against <b>clerical</b> subscription to the Thirty-Nine Articles, and so helped start {{one of the most}} profound debates within the Church of England in the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Peter of Bruys {{admitted}} the doctrinal {{authority of the}} Gospels in their literal interpretation; the other New Testament writings {{he seems to have}} considered valueless, as he doubted their apostolic origin. He questioned the Old Testament and rejected the authority of the Church Fathers and that of the Roman Catholic Church itself. Petrobrusians also opposed <b>clerical</b> celibacy, infant baptism, prayers for the dead, and organ music.|$|E
5|$|Satan preaches from {{a raised}} earth mound and {{is dressed in}} <b>clerical</b> {{clothing}} {{that may be a}} soutane. He has a goat-like beard and horns, and stands in silhouette, accentuating his heavy body and gaping mouth, which is depicted as if he is screaming. His form may be derived from a 1652 illustration of the Canaanite idol Molech, as illustrated by Athanasius Kircher.|$|E
5|$|Skirmishes with Edward over <b>clerical</b> privileges, royal power, Peckham's use of excommunication, and ecclesiastical {{taxation}} continued, but in October 1286, Edward {{issued a}} writ entitled Circumspecte Agatis which specified {{what types of}} cases the ecclesiastical courts could hear. These included moral issues, matrimonial issues, disputes about wills and testaments, the correction of sins, and slander and physical attacks on the clergy.|$|E
5|$|Some Iranian {{newspapers}} avoided {{mentioning the}} character, presumably to avoid offending Iran's <b>clerical</b> rulers. On March 2009, Javad Shamaqdari, cultural adviser to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, demanded an apology from {{a delegation of}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences actors and producers visiting Iran for what he characterized as negative and unfair portrayals of the Islamic republic in The Wrestler and other Hollywood films.|$|E
5|$|The SS-Frauenkops was an {{auxiliary}} reporting and <b>clerical</b> unit, {{which included the}} SS-Helferinnenkorps (Women Helper Corps), made up of female volunteers. Members were assigned as administrative staff and supply personnel, and served in command positions and as guards at women's concentration camps. Like their male equivalents in the SS, females participated in atrocities against Jews, Poles, and others.|$|E
5|$|The {{abolition}} of papal authority made way not for orderly change, but for dissension and violence. Iconoclasm, destruction, disputes within communities {{that led to}} violence, and radical challenge to all forms of faith were reported daily to Cromwell—developments he tried {{to hide from the}} King. Once Henry knew what was afoot, he acted. Thus at the end of 1538, a proclamation was issued forbidding free discussion of the Sacrament and forbidding <b>clerical</b> marriage, on pain of death.|$|E
5|$|The incessant warfare of the 1290s put a great {{financial}} {{demand on}} Edward's subjects. Whereas the King had only levied three lay subsidies until 1294, four such taxes were granted {{in the years}} 1294–97, raising over £200,000. Along with this came the burden of prises (appropriation of food), seizure of wool and hides, and the unpopular additional duty on wool, dubbed the maltolt. The fiscal demands on the King's subjects caused resentment, and this resentment eventually led to serious political opposition. The initial resistance was not caused by the lay taxes, however, but by <b>clerical</b> subsidies. In 1294, Edward made a demand of a grant of one half of all <b>clerical</b> revenues. There was some resistance, but the King responded by threatening with outlawry, and the grant was eventually made. At the time, the archbishopric of Canterbury was vacant, since Robert Winchelsey was in Italy to receive consecration. Winchelsey returned in January 1295 and had to consent to another grant in November of that year. In 1296, however, his position changed when he received the papal bull Clericis laicos. This bull prohibited the clergy from paying taxes to lay authorities without explicit consent from the Pope. When the clergy, {{with reference to the}} bull, refused to pay, Edward responded with outlawry. Winchelsey was presented with a dilemma between loyalty to the King and upholding the papal bull, and he responded by leaving it to every individual clergyman to pay as he saw fit. By the end of the year, a solution was offered by the new papal bull Etsi de statu, which allowed <b>clerical</b> taxation in cases of pressing urgency.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the council took place on 21 March 1148 at Reims Cathedral on a Sunday. Eugene and his attendants had arrived in Reims by 9 March. The main {{business}} of the council was the debate {{on a number of}} canons, or rules, for the church that would be announced. Most of these were not new decrees, having been promulgated by Eugene's predecessor at the councils of Reims in 1131 and at the Lateran council of 1139. All of the proposed canons were approved, except for one on <b>clerical</b> attire which was opposed by Rainald of Dassel and other German ecclesiastics. This canon had prohibited cloaks made of fur. Another canon condemning <b>clerical</b> marriage was greeted with amusement, as the council members felt that all clergy should already know that marriage was forbidden to them.|$|E
5|$|The shield is {{the normal}} device for {{displaying}} {{a coat of}} arms. Clergy have used less-military shapes such as the oval cartouche, but the shield {{has always been a}} <b>clerical</b> option. Clergy in Italy often use a shield shaped like a horse's face-armor. Clergy in South Africa sometimes follow the national style using a Nguni shield. Women traditionally display their coats of arms on a diamond-shaped lozenge; abbesses follow this tradition or use the cartouche.|$|E
5|$|The two {{earliest}} codes {{were concerned}} with <b>clerical</b> matters, and Æthelstan stated that he acted {{on the advice of}} Wulfhelm and his bishops. The first asserts the importance of paying tithes to the church. The second enforces the duty of charity on Æthelstan's reeves, specifying the amount to be given to the poor and requiring reeves to free one penal slave annually. His religious outlook is shown in a wider sacralization of the law in his reign.|$|E
5|$|The {{war was a}} {{transformative}} {{experience for}} Truman that brought out his leadership qualities. He had entered the service in 1917 as a family farmer who had worked in <b>clerical</b> jobs that did not require the ability to motivate and direct others, but during the war he gained leadership experience and a record of success that greatly enhanced and supported his post-war political career in Missouri.|$|E
5|$|This rule of {{tincture}} {{is often}} broken in <b>clerical</b> arms: {{the flag and}} arms of Vatican City notably have yellow (gold) and white (silver) placed together. In Byzantine tradition, colors have a mystical interpretation. Because gold and silver express sublimity and solemnity, {{combinations of the two}} are often used regardless of the rule of tincture.|$|E
5|$|Two prototypes {{are known}} to have been built, but some records suggest that others were also built. The {{original}} order called for three aircraft and was amended later for two additional aircraft with M-82 engines. Some sources quote dates for the latter version's first flight of January 1942 and 15 October 1941, which could be an indication that two of the latter version were completed, or they could simply be <b>clerical</b> errors.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid was criticised for {{dressing}} his household and servants in clothing fit for royalty. He was accompanied on his travels by a retinue of warriors, one of whom, while at York, Wilfrid sent to abduct {{a young boy}} who had been promised to the church but whose family had changed their mind. Wilfrid also educated young men, both for <b>clerical</b> and secular careers.|$|E
5|$|A young {{officer in}} the 4th Dragoons, Lieutenant William Light who later served on Graham's staff and was a great admirer of the general, {{subsequently}} became the Surveyor General of South Australia in the 1830s. Light decided to name one of the valleys in the new colony Barossa Valley (now a famous wine making region) {{in memory of the}} victory, albeit misspelled due to a <b>clerical</b> error. It is often incorrectly stated that Light fought at the Battle of Barrosa but he was actually hundreds of miles to the north, his diary of 6 March 1811 recording he was with Wellington's cavalry travelling through Santarem to Pernes.|$|E
5|$|Administrative reforms {{during the}} 19th century {{included}} {{the replacement of}} oral examinations with written entrance tests, greater tolerance for religious dissent, {{and the establishment of}} four women's colleges. Privy Council decisions in the 20th century (e.g. the abolition of compulsory daily worship, dissociation of the Regius Professorship of Hebrew from <b>clerical</b> status, diversion of colleges' theological bequests to other purposes) loosened the link with traditional belief and practice. Furthermore, although the university's emphasis had historically been on classical knowledge, its curriculum expanded during the 19th century to include scientific and medical studies. Knowledge of Ancient Greek was required for admission until 1920, and Latin until 1960.|$|E
5|$|After {{law school}} {{he passed the}} bar and began {{practicing}} law in Portland, Oregon in 1939. He {{found it hard to}} find work in Portland, but through the connections of his father, he started working for the Japanese government at its consulate in Chicago, Illinois. He was employed as one of several Consular attachés at that office, mainly doing <b>clerical</b> work. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, which drew the United States into World War II against Japan and Germany, Yasui resigned his position with the consulate on December 8, 1941.|$|E
5|$|Albert {{promoted}} {{many public}} educational institutions. Chiefly at meetings {{in connection with}} these {{he spoke of the}} need for better schooling. A collection of his speeches was published in 1857. Recognised as a supporter of education and technological progress, he was invited to speak at scientific meetings, such as the memorable address he delivered as president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science when it met at Aberdeen in 1859. His espousal of science met with <b>clerical</b> opposition; he and Palmerston unsuccessfully recommended a knighthood for Charles Darwin, after the publication of On the Origin of Species, which was opposed by the Bishop of Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Andrew was the {{favorite}} nephew of Stephen Báthory who officially adopted him. Giovanni Andrea Caligari, the papal nuncio (or ambassador) in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, urged the king to persuade Andrew {{to start a}} church career. According to the Transylvanian historian, István Szamosközy, Andrew had already been fascinated by altars, churches and tombs as a child. However, his Protestant mother and relatives wanted to dissuade Andrew. After recovering from an almost lethal pneumonia in spring 1581, Andrew accepted their advice. He was especially worried about <b>clerical</b> celibacy, because it prevented him from fathering legitimate children. He also hoped that his uncle would promote his secular career. His Jesuit tutors finally persuaded him to accept his uncle's decision.|$|E
5|$|Beshear and Abramson easily {{defeated}} Farmer and Williams, carrying 90 of Kentucky's 120 counties. Days later, the Lexington Herald-Leader {{reported that}} Farmer had placed his girlfriend in a non-merit agriculture department job on October 31, 2011. Williams {{confirmed that the}} woman was Farmer's girlfriend, but denied knowledge {{that she had been}} put on the state payroll. Farmer defended the hiring, saying his girlfriend was qualified for the job, which involved administrative and <b>clerical</b> tasks, and that his legal team had assured him that he had followed all appropriate hiring regulations. Farmer's successor, Republican James Comer, fired Farmer's girlfriend a day after being sworn into office.|$|E
