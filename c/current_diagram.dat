But it was impossible to apply them for the case of the deep-slot squrrel-cage induction motors with the slot-depth larger than 2 cm, because, in this case, the locus of the locked equivalent winding impeadamce phasor was not reprensented exactlly. Using Dr. M. Norman 2 ̆ 7 s theory, we could established the current diiagram method which was appropriative for this case. So, in this paper we report the new method that was devised for practical use.

40|$|Introduction The {{starting}} point of the present paper is the result on the asymptotics of random growth of Young diagrams obtained in [1], [9]. The subject of these articles was a discrete time Markov process with the set of Young diagrams as a state space. At each stage of the process a new random box {{is attached to the}} <b>current</b> <b>diagram.</b> The definition of transition probabilities was motivated by asymptotic problems of representation theory of symmetric groups, see [4]. Taking into account the origins of the process in representation theory, we call it the Plancherel Growth Process. In the process of growth, the area of a diagram increases to infinity. If a diagram is contracted uniformly, so that its area is normalized to unity, the edge of the diagram looks more and more like a continuous curve. The essential part of the result discovered and proved in [1], [9] is as follows: in the course of Plancherel Growth Process almost all of Young diagrams become unif...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{understand}} the modes of historicity present in the Anexo, supplement of culture and arts published in the newspaper Diário do Paraná in the late 1970 ’s, with the intention of being a graphic space for artistic experimentation, an attempt to make art in the newspaper. Based on the idea of Eric Landowski, according to which every newspaper tells a certain history of the present, it is important to understand what kind of history and figurations of temporality the supplement produced. For this, we will use the concepts of heterotopy, understanding the supplements of art/culture as spaces other in relation to the <b>current</b> <b>diagram</b> of newspapers, and of heterochrony, seeking to understand the modes of experience of time produced within these spaces. The intention is to demonstrate that the supplement used art and its fictions to tell a story of the present that diagnosed, at the very moment of its emergence, the regime of historicity presentist and, at the same time, sought to perceive and give voice to a whole series of virtual consistencies that subsisted in the interstices of its actuality...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Textural {{analysis}} {{carried out}} for the sediments of the Nayakkankuppam coast revealed that inlet part is dominated by fine sand, central part is dominated by medium sand and outlet part is dominated by coarse sand. The grain size parameters namely Mean size (MZ), standard deviation (σ 1), skewness(Ski), and kurtosis (KG) of percentile values derived from the cumulative curves following Folk and Ward and the moment technique based upon grouped data are most widely used. It is observed that in Nayakkankuppam, most of the samples were fallen in the moderately well sorted to well sorted nature. Skewness measures asymmetry of frequency distribution and marks the position of mean with respect to median. The fine skewed nature of the sediments clearly exhibits sediment input from various sources of tributaries. The finely skewed nature is also implies a low velocity than normal, this skewness data indicated that the sediments are nearly symmetrical to fine skewed, the median class of the sediments dominate almost throughout their distribution.

40|$|Abstract: Layout, in {{the context}} of diagram editors, is the {{positioning}} of diagram components on the screen. Editor users enjoy automatic layout, but they usually like to control the layout at runtime, too. Our pattern-based layout approach allows for automatic and user-controlled layout at the same time: The diagram editor may au-tomatically apply layout patterns to diagram parts based on syntactic rules provided by the editor developer, but editor users may also select diagram parts and then ap-ply layout patterns to them. For instance, user-selected components may be aligned horizontally and remain aligned even after diagram modifications. This paper describes continued work on pattern-based layout. We present automatic ad-hoc layout which combines automatic and user-controlled layout in a new way. While automatic layout is syntax-based and must be specified by the editor devel-oper in advance, automatic ad-hoc layout is solely based on the <b>current</b> <b>diagram</b> lay-out. Whenever the layout engine detects a situation where a pattern may be applied with no or only small diagram changes, this layout pattern is automatically applied. For instance, if a set of components is almost horizontally aligned on the screen, the horizontal alignment pattern is automatically applied to these components. Such an editor behavior is known from so-called snap lines in commercial diagram ed-itors. Automatic ad-hoc layout generalizes on these manually programmed layout solutions and offers many additional layout features. This paper describes the concept of automatic ad-hoc layout as well as its integration into a diagram editor framework and discusses issues of this new layout approach...|$|E
