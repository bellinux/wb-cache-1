5|$|A helical {{resonator}} {{is similar}} to a stub, in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements. They are built in a non-planar format and consist of a <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire,</b> on a former and core, and connected only at one end. The device is usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose. They are most useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and SHF bands.|$|E
5|$|The {{inductor}} is a conductor, {{usually a}} <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire,</b> that stores energy in {{a magnetic field}} {{in response to the}} current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, inducing a voltage between the ends of the conductor. The induced voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of the current. The constant of proportionality is termed the inductance. The unit of inductance is the henry, named after Joseph Henry, a contemporary of Faraday. One henry is the inductance that will induce a potential difference of one volt if the current through it changes at a rate of one ampere per second. The inductor's behaviour is in some regards converse to that of the capacitor: it will freely allow an unchanging current, but opposes a rapidly changing one.|$|E
5|$|This Case further {{represented}} {{the development of}} the incandescent electric light bulb from the fundamental steps shown in Case #1. These electric lamps were from worldwide inventors that worked directly with Edison on ideas. The electric light bulbs were grouped chronologically from 1881 to 1904. Among these were some Diehl's induction lamps for use with alternating current. A description of how this technology worked is that of a secondary <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> was placed inside the bulb of a vacuum. The two ends of the coiled wire connected to the filament that was electrified and provided the light. A primary coil was wound {{on the outside of the}} glass bulb. This coil was connected to an alternating current electrical power supply. The secondary coil inside the bulb would receive this alternating magnetism from the primary coil and provide an electrical current that electrified the inside filament. Ultimately this type of alternating current technology never developed and was not used. Pictures of some of the lamps that were in this display are below. These were later numbered 358 to 536.|$|E

In this application, a very lightweight coil of wires is mounted within a strong magnetic field produced by permanent rare-earth magnets. The voice coil is the motor part of the servo system that positions the heads: an electric control signal drives the voice coil and the resulting force quickly and accurately positions the heads.|$|E
25|$|The Bellini–Tosi system {{feeds the}} output voltage of a loop or Adcock antenna {{into a small}} <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire,</b> the field coil. The varying voltage induced by the {{received}} signal causes the wire to re-radiate the same signal. Although as the coil is typically very {{much smaller than the}} wavelength and thus has a small antenna factor, the use of many loops of wire in the coil improves the overall signal strength. The total energy radiated by the coil is less than what is received on the antenna, but it broadcasts this into a much smaller physical area, so the flux may be much higher than the original signal.|$|E

25|$|The five-needle telegraph, {{which was}} mainly, if not entirely, due to Wheatstone, {{was similar to}} that of Schilling, and based on the {{principle}} enunciated by André-Marie Ampère – that is to say, the current was sent into the line by completing the circuit of the battery with a make and break key, and at the other end it passed through a <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> surrounding a magnetic needle free to turn round its centre. According as one pole of the battery or the other was applied to the line by means of the key, the current deflected the needle to one side or the other. There were five separate circuits actuating five different needles. The latter were pivoted in rows across the middle of a dial shaped like a diamond, and having the letters of the alphabet arranged upon {{it in such a way}} that a letter was literally pointed out by the current deflecting two of the needles towards it.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{different}} types of microphone are in use, which employ different methods to convert the air pressure variations of a sound wave to an electrical signal. [...] The most common are the dynamic microphone, which uses a <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> suspended in a magnetic field; the condenser microphone, which uses the vibrating diaphragm as a capacitor plate, and the piezoelectric microphone, which uses a crystal of piezoelectric material.

25|$|A {{multiple}} coil magnet is an electromagnet {{that has}} several <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> connected in parallel.

2500|$|Nikola Tesla first {{discovered}} resonant coupling during his pioneering experiments in {{wireless power transfer}} {{around the turn of}} the 20th century, [...] but the possibilities of using resonant coupling to increase transmission range has only recently been explored. [...] In 2007 a team led by Marin Soljačić at MIT used two coupled tuned circuits each made of a 25cm self-resonant <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> at 10MHz to achieve the transmission of 60 W of power over a distance of [...] (8 times the coil diameter) at around 40% efficiency.|$|E
2500|$|... where [...] is the EMF and ΦB is the {{magnetic}} flux. The {{direction of the}} electromotive force is given by Lenz's law which states that an induced current will flow in the direction that will oppose the change which produced it. This {{is due to the}} negative sign in the previous equation. To increase the generated EMF, a common approach is to exploit flux linkage by creating a tightly wound <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire,</b> composed of N identical turns, each with the same magnetic flux going through them. The resulting EMF is then N times that of one single wire.|$|E
2500|$|Resonant {{inductive}} coupling (electrodynamic coupling, strongly coupled magnetic resonance) {{is a form}} of {{inductive coupling}} in which power is transferred by magnetic fields (B, green) between two resonant circuits (tuned circuits), one in the transmitter and one in the receiver (see diagram, right). [...] Each resonant circuit consists of a <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> connected to a capacitor, or a self-resonant coil or other resonator with internal capacitance. [...] The two are tuned to resonate at the same resonant frequency. [...] The resonance between the coils can greatly increase coupling and power transfer, analogously to the way a vibrating tuning fork can induce sympathetic vibration in a distant fork tuned to the same pitch.|$|E

2500|$|Single block {{wire drawing}} {{machines}} include means for holding the dies accurately in position and for drawing the wire steadily through the holes. The usual design {{consists of a}} cast-iron bench or table having a bracket standing up to hold the die, and a vertical drum which rotates and by coiling the wire around its surface pulls it through the die, the <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> being stored upon another drum or [...] "swift" [...] which lies behind the die and reels off the wire as fast as required. The wire drum or [...] "block" [...] is provided with means for rapidly coupling or uncoupling it to its vertical shaft, so that {{the motion of the}} wire may be stopped or started instantly. The block is also tapered, so that the <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> may be easily slipped off upwards when finished. Before the wire can be attached to the block, a sufficient length of it must be pulled through the die; this is effected by a pair of gripping pincers {{on the end of a}} chain which is wound around a revolving drum, so drawing the wire until enough can be coiled two or three times on the block, where the end is secured by a small screw clamp or vice. When the wire is on the block, it is set in motion and the wire is drawn steadily through the die; it is very important that the block rotates evenly and that it runs true and pulls the wire at a constant velocity, otherwise [...] "snatching" [...] occurs which will weaken or even break the wire. The speeds at which wire is drawn vary greatly, according to the material and the amount of reduction.|$|E
2500|$|A {{resonant}} circuit (tuned circuit) which serves {{to select the}} frequency of the desired radio station out of all the radio signals received by the antenna. The tuned circuit consists of a <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> (called an inductor) and a capacitor connected together, so as to create a circuit that resonates at {{the frequency of the}} desired station, and hence [...] "tune" [...] in that station. One or both of the coil or capacitor is adjustable, allowing the circuit to be tuned to different frequencies. In some circuits a capacitor is not used, as the antenna also serves as the capacitor. The tuned circuit has a resonant frequency and allows radio waves at that frequency to pass to the detector, while rejecting waves at all other frequencies. Such a circuit is also known as a bandpass filter.|$|E
2500|$|The {{moving coil}} driver, more {{commonly}} referred to as a [...] "dynamic" [...] driver is the most common type used in headphones. [...] It consists of a stationary magnet element affixed to the frame of the headphone which sets up a static magnetic field. The magnet in headphones is typically composed of ferrite or neodymium. [...] A voice coil, a light <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire,</b> is suspended in the magnetic field of the magnet, attached to a diaphragm, typically fabricated from lightweight, high-stiffness-to-mass-ratio cellulose, polymer, carbon material, paper or the like. [...] When the varying current of an audio signal is passed through the coil, it creates a varying magnetic field which reacts against the static magnetic field, exerting a varying force on the coil causing it and the attached diaphragm to vibrate back and forth. The vibrating diaphragm pushes on the air producing sound waves.|$|E

The first three terms represent {{the sum of the}} self-inductances <b>of</b> the various <b>coils.</b> The formula is easily extended to any number <b>of</b> series <b>coils</b> with mutual coupling. The method can be used to find the self-inductance <b>of</b> large <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> <b>of</b> any cross-sectional shape by computing the sum of the mutual inductance of each turn <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> in the <b>coil</b> with every other turn since in such a coil all turns are in series.|$|R
25|$|An {{electronic}} component that {{is intended to}} add inductance to a circuit is called an inductor.

2500|$|In general a {{wireless}} power system {{consists of a}} [...] "transmitter" [...] connected to a source of power such as a mains power line, which converts the power to a time-varying electromagnetic field, and one or more [...] "receiver" [...] devices which receive the power and convert it back to DC or AC electric current which is used by an electrical load. [...] At the transmitter the input power is converted to an oscillating electromagnetic field by some type of [...] "antenna" [...] device. [...] The word [...] "antenna" [...] is used loosely here; {{it may be a}} <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> which generates a magnetic field, a metal plate which generates an electric field, an antenna which radiates radio waves, or a laser which generates light. [...] A similar antenna or coupling device at the receiver converts the oscillating fields to an electric current. [...] An important parameter that determines the type of waves is the frequency, which determines the wavelength.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most widely}} used type of speaker in the 2010s is the dynamic speaker, invented in 1925 by Edward W. Kellogg and Chester W. Rice. [...] The dynamic speaker {{operates}} on the same basic principle as a dynamic microphone, but in reverse, to produce sound from an electrical signal. When an alternating current electrical audio signal is applied to its voice coil, a <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> suspended in a circular gap between the poles of a permanent magnet, the coil is forced to move rapidly back and forth due to Faraday's law of induction, which causes a diaphragm (usually conically shaped) attached to the coil to move back and forth, pushing on the air to create sound waves. Besides this most common method, there are several alternative technologies {{that can be used}} to convert an electrical signal into sound. The sound source (e.g., a sound recording or a microphone) must be amplified or strengthened with an audio power amplifier before the signal is sent to the speaker.|$|E
2500|$|The early {{earphones}} {{used with}} wireless-era crystal sets had moving iron drivers that {{worked in a}} way similar to the horn loudspeakers of the period; modern loudspeakers use a moving-coil principle. Each earpiece contained a permanent magnet about which was a <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> which formed a second [...] electromagnet. Both magnetic poles were close to a steel diaphram of the speaker. When the audio signal from the radio was passed through the electromagnet's windings, current was caused to flow in the coil which created a varying magnetic field that augmented or diminished that due to the permanent magnet. This varied the force of attraction on the diaphragm, causing it to vibrate. The vibrations of the diaphragm push and pull {{on the air in}} front of it, creating sound waves. Standard headphones used in telephone work had a low impedance, often 75 Ω, and required more current than a crystal radio could supply. Therefore, the type used with crystal set radios (and other sensitive equipment) was wound with more turns of finer wire giving it a high impedance of 2000-8000 Ω.|$|E
50|$|The {{current to}} be {{measured}} is passed in series through two <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire,</b> one <b>of</b> which is attached to one arm of a sensitive balance.

This is used to calculate the magnitude of the current.|$|R
