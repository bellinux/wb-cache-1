5|$|I {{feel that}} {{talking about it}} trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah. I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and obviously I {{know a lot about}} Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and I find that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is to be open to everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> to our real nature.|$|E
5|$|In the flash-sideways scenes which {{depict the}} survivors' afterlife, Rousseau {{is still the}} mother of Alex and lives with her. Alex {{introduces}} her mother to Dr. Linus because he's been hurt after being battered by Desmond. Danielle and Alex bring him home for dinner. While Alex is doing her homework, Danielle and Dr. Linus talk about her. She tells him that {{since the death of}} her father when she was two, he's the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> to a father figure that she has. Dr. Linus is visibly touched.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{from the}} 9th and 10th centuries make {{no mention of}} the Polan (Polanie) tribe. The <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> would be the huge (400 gords) Glopeani tribe of the Bavarian Geographer, whose name seems to be derived from that of Lake Gopło, but archeological {{investigations}} cannot confirm any such scale of settlement activity in Lake Gopło area. What the research does indicate is the presence of several distinct tribes in 9th-century Greater Poland, one around the upper and middle Obra River basin, one in the lower Obra basin, and another one west of the Warta River. There was the Gniezno area tribe, whose settlements were concentrated around the regional cult center: the Lech Hill of today's Gniezno. Throughout the 9th century, the Greater Poland tribes did not constitute a uniform entity or whole in the cultural, or settlement pattern sense. The centrally located Gniezno Land was at that time rather isolated from external influences, such as from the highly developed Moravian-Czech or Baltic Sea centers. Such separation was probably a positive factor by facilitating the efforts of a lineage of leaders from an elder clan of a tribe there, known as the Piast House, which resulted {{in the early part of}} the 10th century in the establishment of an embryonic Polish state.|$|E

His pitch, a bittersweet sci fi-tinged tone poem entitled The <b>Closest</b> <b>Thing</b> to Time Travel, {{was selected as}} one of only 30 pitches (out of over 240 entries) to be turned into short films using Getty stock footage material. In early 2006 Kines finished his film, and when the competition was {{open to the public}} for final voting, The <b>Closest</b> <b>Thing</b> to Time Travel won Kines the Grand Prize of $10,000 and trips to New York City, Chicago, and Bozeman, Montana, where Kines was a speaker at HATCHfest.|$|E

25|$|Earl Warren had a {{profound}} impact on American values.

25|$|Since Simpson's 1945 classification, the paleontological {{record has}} been recalibrated, and the {{intervening}} years have seen much debate and progress concerning the theoretical underpinnings of systematization itself, partly through the new concept of cladistics. Though field work gradually made Simpson's classification outdated, it remained the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> to an official classification of mammals. See list of placental mammals and list of monotremes and marsupials for more detailed information on mammal genera and species.|$|E
25|$|Burundi {{never had}} a fixed capital. The <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> was a royal hill, when the king moved, the {{location}} became the capital called the insago.

The royal palace had three royal courtyards. Each serve a particular function one for herders, a sanctuary, kitchen and granary.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} of the mythic past after the creation, Ra dwells on earth as king of the gods and of humans. This period is the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> to a golden age in Egyptian tradition, {{the period of}} {{stability}} that the Egyptians constantly sought to evoke and imitate. Yet the stories about Ra's reign focus on conflicts between him and forces that disrupt his rule, reflecting the king's role in Egyptian ideology as enforcer of maat.|$|E

25|$|During these investigations, {{numerous}} witnesses {{came forward}} with damning testimony, almost all of which was corroborated by other witnesses. One witness, Captain Silas Soule, who had ordered the men under his command not to fire their weapons, was murdered in Denver just weeks after offering his testimony. However, despite the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the Wars' recommendation, no charges were brought against those who committed the massacre. Chivington was {{beyond the reach of}} army justice because he'd already resigned his commission. The <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> to a punishment he suffered was the effective end of his political aspirations.|$|E
25|$|The Israelite {{system of}} {{measuring}} area was fairly informal; the biblical text merely measures areas by describing how much land could be sown {{with a certain}} volume measure of seed, for example the amount of land able to be sown with 2 seahs of barley. The <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> to a formal area unit was the yoke (Hebrew semed) (sometimes translated as acre), which referred {{to the amount of}} land that a pair of yoked oxen could plough in a single day; in Mesopotamia the standard estimate for this was 6,480 square cubits, which is roughly equal to a third of an acre.|$|E
25|$|The son of Constantine was T'oros I, {{who succeeded}} him in around 1100. During his rule, he faced both Byzantines and Seljuks, and {{expanded}} the Rubenid domain. He transferred the Cilician capital from Tarsus to Sis after having eliminated the small Byzantine garrison stationed there. In 1112, {{he took the}} castle of Cyzistra in order to avenge {{the death of the}} last Bagratid Armenian king, Gagik II. The assassins of the latter, three Byzantine brothers who governed the castle, were thus brutally killed. Eventually, there emerged a type of centralized government in the area with the rise of the Rubenid princes. During the twelfth century, they were the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> to a ruling dynasty, and wrestled with the Byzantines for power over the region.|$|E

I wish we had a good feed to give them." ...|$|R
40|$|Spatializations are {{computer}} visualizations {{in which}} nonspatial information is depicted spatially. Spatializations of large databases commonly use distance {{as a metaphor}} to depict semantic (nonspatial) similarities among data items. By analogy to the "first law of geography", which states that <b>closer</b> <b>things</b> {{tend to be more}} similar, we propose a "first law of cognitive geography," which states that people believe <b>closer</b> <b>things</b> are more similar. In this paper, we present two experiments that investigate the validity of the first law of cognitive geography as applied to the interpretation of "point-display spatializations. " Point displays depict documents (or other information-bearing entities) as 2 - or 3 -dimensional collections of points. Our results largely support the first law of cognitive geography and enrich it by identifying different types of distance that may be metaphorically related to similarity. We also identify characteristics of point displays other than distance relationships that influence similarity judgments...|$|R
5000|$|Summers and Swan {{claimed that}} Turner had gushed of a [...] "very serious affair" [...] between the two, {{and that they}} had only faked {{splitting}} up their relationship to oblige to MGM's concerns. Turner later denied the claims in her 1992 autobiography, saying that [...] "the <b>closest</b> <b>things</b> to dates Frank and I enjoyed were a few box lunches at MGM".|$|R
25|$|He {{had gained}} near-total control of RKO {{by the end}} of 1954 at a cost of nearly $24million, {{becoming}} the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> to a sole owner of a Hollywood studio seen in three decades. Six months later, Hughes sold the studio to the General Tire and Rubber Company for $25million. Hughes retained the rights to pictures that he had personally produced, including those made at RKO. He also retained Jane Russell's contract. For Howard Hughes, this was the virtual end of his 25-year involvement in the motion picture industry. However, his reputation as a financial wizard emerged unscathed. During that time period, RKO became known as the home of film noir classic productions {{thanks in part to the}} limited budgets required to make such films during Hughes' tenure. Hughes reportedly walked away from RKO having made $6.5million in personal profit.|$|E
25|$|Schopenhauer {{was first}} {{introduced}} to the 1802 Latin Upanishad translation through Friedrich Majer. They met {{during the winter of}} 1813–1814 in Weimar at the home of Schopenhauer's mother according to the biographer Safranski. Majer was a follower of Herder, and an early Indologist. Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814. Sansfranski maintains that between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian thought in Dresden. This was through his neighbor of two years, Karl Christian Friedrich Krause. Krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of ancient Indian wisdom. Krause had also mastered Sanskrit, unlike Schopenhauer, and the two developed a professional relationship. It was from Krause that Schopenhauer learned meditation and received the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> to expert advice concerning Indian thought.|$|E
25|$|Luis Hernando de Larramendi gained no {{dedicated}} scholarly work; the <b>closest</b> <b>thing</b> to a monograph are chapters {{dedicated to}} his father by Ignacio Hernando de Larramendi in his book, Así se hizo MAPFRE (2000). Though highly hagiographic, they provide the most detailed information available so far. Apart from well-known facts from his political career, the chapters offer also lots of private observations and recollections; they {{paint a picture of}} a Catholic taking communion almost every day, a profoundly idealist person, extremely sensitive to any sort of injustice and unrepentant in his political creed, but incapable of violence. Though humble and unpretentious, he is also portrayed as intolerant versus foolishness; this trait is considered moral defect, though also an obstacle in Larramendi’s professional and political career. Tending to solitude, he ran his law office on his own and was getting outpaced by modern legal companies; in terms of politics he built no personal following, relying entirely on his loyalty to the dynasty and trust in Traditionalist doctrine.|$|E

They were no longer a pack, but each one separated into a silent, <b>closed</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|R
