40|$|Vicia sativa L. (common vetch) is {{an annual}} <b>cleaning</b> <b>crop</b> mainly used in {{rotation}} with durum wheat, either for seed and forage yield, in purity or undercropping with other species, well {{adapted to the}} hot-dry climate and poor soils of Southern of Italy. Cultivar identification is done on distinctive traits relieved at variety registration following official protocols (UPOV). The peculiar traits of seeds of some vetch varieties allowed a clearly distinctiveness mainly on some seed features (shape, size, ground color of testa; brown and black ornamentation. Although seed identification process by specialized technicians is possible for some vetch varieties, it is slow and somewhat subjective giving results which {{may be difficult to}} quantify both for business and technological implications. Therefore it is important economically and technically to implement repeatable and quick automated methods to identify and classify seeds. To aid the visual inspection, or replace the human judge in distinguishing different varieties of common vetch, this work presents the development of an image analysis based tool, for the seeds identification of examined varieties.

40|$|Vicia saliva L. is {{an annual}} <b>cleaning</b> <b>crop</b> mainly used in {{rotation}} with durum wheat, both for seed production and for forage, {{either as a}} pure crop or as an undercrop, and is well adapted to the hot-dry climate and poor soils of Southern of Italy. Generally, cultivar identification is done {{on the basis of}} distinctive traits, such as shape, size, colour of the testa and ornamentations, identified during the variety registration, following official protocols. For some vetch varieties seed identification by specialized technicians is possible without difficulty, while for other varieties it is very difficult and sometimes impossible to achieve undoubted identification. Therefore, it is important, from both technical and economical points of view, to have a quick, reliable, repeatable, and non destructive method to be able to identify and classify seeds objectively. In order to promote computerised image analysis as a tool to aid visual inspection and replace human judgement in the discrimination of different seeds, this technique was applied to analyse and identify seeds of common vetch varieties. Seed size, shape and colour of nine Italian cultivars of common vetch (Vicia saliva L.) and one of hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.) were measured using digital images acquired by a flatbed scanner and, {{on the basis of a}} Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithm, a statistical classifier able to identify the ten cultivars was implemented...|$|E

25|$|The combine harvester, or combine, or thresher, is {{a machine}} that {{combines}} the tasks of harvesting, threshing, and <b>cleaning</b> grain <b>crops.</b> The objective is to complete these three processes, {{which used to be}} distinct, in one pass of the machine over a particular part of the field. The waste straw left behind on the field is the remaining dried stems and leaves of the crop with limited nutrients which is either chopped or spread on the field, or baled for livestock feed. The first combine harvester was invented by Hiram Moore in 1834.|$|R

40|$|Arable weeds {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{endangered}} species groups in Europe. Modern agriculture and intensive land use management with the application of herbicides and fertilisers, enhanced seed <b>cleaning,</b> simplified <b>crop</b> rotations and abandonment of marginal arable sites are the main causes for the continuous decline of arable weeds. However, besides these changes in land use also global climate change may challenge the adaptability of arable weeds. Most scientists agree that the frequency of extreme meteorological conditions will increase in the future. As a consequence, plants of Central Europe will be subject to higher temperatures and reduced water supply due to longer intervals without precipitation during the growing season. We exposed seeds of five common and five endangered arable weed species to different temperatures and water potentials to study i) how this plant group responds to higher temperatures and lower moisture during germination in general and ii) whether there is a significant difference between common and endangered species in this respect...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2008 Australasian Plant Pathology SocietyThe life history, {{importance}} {{and management of}} the anguinid nematodes of Australia are briefly summarised. Anguina funesta is the most important because of its association with the toxigenic actinomycete, Rathayibacter toxicus, and consequent contribution to annual ryegrass toxicity (ARGT). Although study of A. funesta has provided a good understanding of its biology and workable approaches to control, outbreaks of ARGT still occur and issues remain for exports. An undescribed Anguina species, also associated with R. toxicus and livestock deaths (flood plain staggers), is of economic concern but its dispersed and sporadic occurrence has limited impetus and opportunity for its further study. Anguina tritici exists in Australia only as remnant populations, having been eliminated by mechanised seed <b>cleaning</b> and <b>crop</b> rotations over most of its widespread range of a century ago. A further seven anguinids are known from Australia and, although of minimal economic significance, represent an opportunity for description of new species and further study of this highly specialised group of plant-parasitic nematodes.

40|$|Nonionic {{surfactants}} {{have been}} used extensively in various industrial applications such as <b>cleaning,</b> personal care, <b>crop</b> protection, paint and coating, textile finishing, emulsion stabilization, food and leather processing. In this study, we have studied the adsorption of three nonionic surfactants of alkyl polyglycoside, namely commercial APG from Cognis and APG produced from glucose as well as APG synthesized from sago starch, at fluid–fluid interfaces. The variation of surface and interfacial tension with the concentration of surfactant in the bulk was studied, and the data were fitted using a surface equation of state derived from the Langmuir isotherm. The agreement between ?(c) data and Langmuir isotherm model was very good. Keywords: adsorption, air/water interface, interfacial tension, surface tensio...|$|R
40|$|Arable weeds {{are among}} those groups of plants that are most {{threatened}} in Europe due to management intensification and efficient <b>cleaning</b> of <b>crop</b> seeds in modern agriculture. Plant species loss in arable fields had been assessed in many European countries about 30 years ago, and has gained renewed interest {{during the last few}} years. A rich historical data set on plots where arable weeds had historically been recorded in Switzerland enabled the study of changes in arable weed species since the 1920 s onward. In total, 232 locations with historical plots were revisited. There, we recorded all plant species and their abundances on 100 m 2 plots. Across all plots the average number of species per plot declined dramatically by more than 60 % during the last 90 years. Most species decreased in frequency, but common species stayed more frequent, while rare species − often characteristic weeds of traditionally managed crop fields − decreased in frequency or even disappeared. Plant groups with increasing species numbers and frequency were mostly neophytes, grasses and species with high nutrient demand. The above mentioned decline in species number and frequency of rare and characteristic weed species suggests that more effective conservation measures than hitherto taken are needed to ensure their preservation...|$|R
40|$|In {{assessing}} the optimal composition of machine and tractor fleet nomenclature and quantitative composition of parks of technical means and some parameters of production technology {{are used as}} varying variables, leaving the timing of mechanized fieldwork fixed. At the same time, changing the duration of mechanized operations in the most intense periods of the field season can significantly affect {{the amount of the}} basic means of mechanization as a part of machine and tractor fleet, the value of investments in its formation. The article used a method of determining the composition of the machine and tractor fleet of agricultural organizations considered the "flexible" duration of the mechanized operations in field and based on the iterative adjustment {{of the results of the}} optimization of machine and tractor fleet by the criterion of the minimum difference between savings investment and value of crop losses. The analysis showed that the economically viable term of harvesting of winter crops for domestic combine harvester Acros- 530 is a period of 16 days. The article analyzes the economic efficiency of the different periods of the harvesting campaign using imported agricultural machinery. This work presents a sensitivity analysis of the effect of reducing the need to combine at different periods of <b>cleaning</b> of grain <b>crops</b> to the level of prices for products and equipment...|$|R
30|$|Some {{previous}} research has developed our current understanding and theory of single grain screen-penetrating probability. The probability model and equations for a spherical particle penetrating a hole were developed by Subasinghe et al. (1989). Wen and Liu (1982) put forward various characteristic motions that a single particle on the sieve surface may undertake: relative static, relative sliding and projectile motion. Applying chaotic motion theory to analyze {{the movement of the}} single particle, Liu and Lu (2009) concluded that the motion is nonlinear. Beyond the single particle, theory of particle cluster screen-penetrating probability has also been established. In 1972, the collision speed transfer formula of particle clusters in the sieving process was established by Bruder. Using the method of probability statistics, the mathematical model of the penetration probability along the screen was put forth by Chen and Yan (1982). In recent years, discrete element method (DEM) allows for modeling at the particle level and accounts for interaction between particles and boundary objects. Cleary (2004) and Cleary and Sawley (2002) presented a three dimensional model of spherical particle separation on an inclined flat screen based on DEM. Tong explored the relationship between vibration parameters and screen efficiency, as well as performing simulations of stratification and penetration over various structural and vibration parameters based on the DEM (Chen and Tong 2009, 2010; Wang and Tong 2011). The implementation of DEM for screening process gives an insight to study the particulate systems. DEM simulations have been reported positive results in mineral screening and <b>crop</b> <b>cleaning</b> (Zhu et al. 2008; Weerasekara et al. 2013; Cleary and Dsinnott 2015; Cleary 2015; Xue et al. 2015).|$|R
