40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken with {{the object of}} ascertaining to what extent quarters which have always been free from infection with known pathogenic bacteria secrete abnormal milk, and to determine {{the role played by}} the various aetiological factors in the production of such milk. The data forming the basis of the investigation were derived from the results obtained by regular analysis of milk samples from the individual quarters of ten grade Friesland cows over a period of four and a half years. Two cows completed three lactations, one completed three and a half lactations and the remaining seven each completed four lactations during the period under review. The cows, which were recruited as pregnant heifers before their first calving, remained free from tuberculosis and contagious abortion, and bacteriological examination of the milk at four-weekly intervals, or more frequently when circumstances warranted it, consistently failed to detect mastitis streptococci or other pathogenic micro-organisms in the quarters. Infection of the udder could, therefore, not be incriminated in those cases in which the milk was abnormal. The following six factors were used as criteria, namely, solids-not-fat, fat, chloride, lactose, chloride-lactose index and cell content. Tests for solids-not-fat and fat were conducted at weekly intervals during the first two years and fortnightly subsequently. The other four factors were determined from afternoon samples of milk at four-weekly intervals. The mean obtained for each of the six factors conformed in every case with the standard prescribed for normal milk. Nevertheless {{a large proportion of the}} individual samples at various times yielded results which failed to reach the required standards. Every one of the forty quarters at some time or other secreted milk which was of abnormal composition, and all twelve quarters of three cows yielded milk which was abnormal in the majority of the tests. The results obtained furnish striking evidence of the unreliability of all the recognised tests for streptococcus mastitis, which are based on detecting changes in the composition of the milk. Aetiological Factors. (i) Age. All quarters excepting those that showed evidence of secretory disturbance revealed a slight increase - which was statistically insignificant - in solids-not-fat content in the second lactation. After that the quality of the milk declined, the difference in solids-not-fat content between the second and third lactations being significant. Fat percentage decreased consistently after the first lactation. Most of the cases of secretory disturbance were encountered during the second lactation. This was responsible for a marked increase in the mean <b>chloride</b> <b>percentage</b> from 0. 1123 in the first to 0. 1378 in the second lactation. The third and fourth lactations revealed a slight drop to 0. 1367 and 0. 1354 respectively. The mean chloride content of the milk in the first lactation was significantly lower than that of the other three periods. There was a significant decline in the lactose content in the second and third lactations, followed by an insignificant rise in the fourth. This was accompanied by a rise in the chloride-lactose index in the first three lactations and an insignificant drop in the fourth. The cellular content of the milk showed a considerable increase in every lactation. There was a progressive deterioration in the quality of the milk of most quarters during successive lactations, and several quarters which commenced their lactation life by secreting normal milk in the first period subsequently became abnormal. This gradual degeneration of the quarters is also revealed in the increasing proportion of samples which gave abnormal reactions in successive lactations. The cause of this deterioration is attributed to normal "wear and tear" in the udder, and to a certain extent this is unavoidable. The process may, however, be accelerated by bad management, for instance by prolonged lactation, insufficiently long dry periods, incomplete milking, slow milking, udder injuries and infection with non-pathogenic as well as with pathogenic bacteria. The unnatural strain placed on the udder of the modern dairy cow by requiring it to remain in an almost constant state of high functional activity is also considered w predispose w rapid deterioration of the udder tissues. (ii) Season. A fairly even distribution of the calving dates throughout the year eliminated the marked influence which stage of lactation would have exerted on season if the calvings were confined to a certain period of the year. Contrary to the results obtained by European and American workers, it was found that the quality of the milk secreted by the animals in this {{investigation was}} at its lowest level during the winter months (June to August), when the mean solids-not-fat percentage failed to attain the legal limit of 8. 50. Fat and lactose showed a similar drop, and chloride and chloride-lactose index increased correspondingly to reach their highest level in June. The advent of spring and early summer was characterized by a marked increase in the quality of the milk which reached its peak during the quarter October to December. Solids-not-fat and lactose were then at their highest level, and chloride and chloride-lactose index at their lowest. The largest number of abnormal samples were obtained in winter. No correlation between high environmental temperature and poor quality milk could be established. On the contrary the best milk was secreted during some of the hottest months of the year and the poorest in mid-winter. It is suspected that malnutrition is mainly responsible for the poor quality of the milk in winter, and the suggestion is made that the average South African dairy cow has to exist on a subnormal plane of nutrition during the greater part of the year. (iii) Stage of Lactation. Solids-not-fat declined rapidly from 8. 69 per cent. in the first month of lactation to 8. 40 per cent. in the third month. It fluctuated round this low level for three months and then increased consistently to reach its highest point (8. 71 per cent.) in the final month. The mean solids-not-fat percentage for the first and last months was significantly higher than that for the second to seventh months. The mean percentage was below the legal limit from the 88 th w the 172 nd day after parturition. Fat also reached its lowest percentage in the same period though it never fell below the legal standard. The largest percentage (58. 3) of samples that were deficient in solids-not- fat occurred during the third month and the lowest (25. 8) in the final month of lactation. The mean chloride content of the milk increased consistently with advancing lactation from 0. 118 per cent. in the first to 0. 153 per cent. in the tenth month. Lactose showed a corresponding decrease from 4. 87 per cent. to 4. 58 per cent. Chloride-lactose index increased from 2. 52 to 3. 26 during the same period, and cells from 657, 000 to 1, 524, 000 per ml. The inverse relationship between solids-not-fat and chloride was not maintained during the second half of the lactation period, since chloride content of the milk increased simultaneously with the increase in solids-not-fat while lactose dropped. This is attributed to the fact that the synthetic cells of the gland gradually decline in activity, particularly in the pregnant animal, and the alveolar epithelium becomes more permeable. This permits unchanged blood constituents like serum albumin, serum globulin and salts to pass into the milk unchanged. These constituents maintain solids-not-fat at a high level despite the deficiency in lactose towards the end of lactation. The practical significance of the effect of lactation stage on milk composition lies in the fact that breeding programmes should be so planned that calving dates are more or less evenly distributed throughout the year, so that at any period the cows in the herd represent all stages of lactation. Particularly should calving of a large proportion of the herd in late summer and autumn be avoided, because in such cases the unfavourable effects of stage of lactation and season will coincide and produce marked depression in the quality of the winter milk. (iv) Individuality. Three of the ten cows (7905, 7909 and 7921) persistently secreted milk which was abnormal in all respects excepting fat, and cells in the case of 7905. The low cell content of all four quarters of this cow eliminates infection and abnormal bacterial activity as causal factors in her case, and it is concluded that an inherent weakness of the cow herself or of the udder was responsible for her poor quality milk. In the other two cows secretory disturbance and unknown pathogens as well as hereditary weakness were probably jointly concerned. High milk quality is not always associated with high milk yield, and the final criterion in assessing the value of a cow for milk production and breeding should be the amount of fat and fat-free solids produced rather than the volume of milk. (v) Quarter Differences. In both composition and yield the milk produced by the two forequarters is very similar, as also is that secreted by the two hindquarters. The two rear quarters, however, secrete milk of a higher quality than the two forequarters, and the milk obtained from the anterior half of the udder gave a higher percentage of abnormal react ions to the various tests than that of the posterior half. The mean chloride-lactose index for both forequarters was above the standard prescribed for normal milk. The poorest quality milk was secreted by the left forequarter and the best by the left hind. There was no difference in the quality of the milk from the right and left halves of the udder. (vi) Conformation and Structure. Conformation of the udder was judged by means of a score card on which points were awarded for symmetry, evenness, teats, skin, yieldability, softness, free space and collapsibility. A description based on visual and physical examination is given of each udder. The udders which showed the most pronounced inter-quarter differences in the composition of milk are those characterized by marked asymmetry. The poor quality of the milk secreted by underdeveloped quarters of certain udders is attributed to anatomical defects of such quarters. It is suggested that this may be due to a deficiency of glandular tissue and consequent inability of such quarters to synthesize sufficient fat, lactose and casein for the volume of milk produced. On the other hand there may be a reduction in the storage capacity and elasticity of such quarters whereby intramammary pressure is raised at an unduly fast rate between milkings. From this the further deduction is made that the secretion of inferior quality milk by udders that are well shaped but show evidence of excessive fibrous tissue is due to inability of the gland to expand properly in order to accommodate the volume of milk secreted without unduly raising intramammary pressure. It is suggested that the persistent secretion of poor milk by such quarters is due to defective histological structure which is probably of an hereditary nature. (vii) Non-specific mastitis. This condition in which there was definite evidence of acute inflammation but not pathogenic micro-organisms, was observed five times in two cows (7912 and 7913). Although clinically the affected quarters all appeared to have recovered completely after the attacks, examinations of their milk revealed that only one of the quarters was restored to full normal functioning. In two quarters the deterioration was so marked that the milk secreted subsequently was significantly lower in quality than that yielded by the other quarters of the same cows. All five cases of non-specific mastitis occurred in the second half of the first lactation and in the first half of the second lactation. This and the number of secretory disturbances which were observed at the same time suggest that the udder undergoes its maximum development at that period, and is, therefore, more susceptible to adverse influences at this stage than at any other. The cause of the non-specific mastitis was not determined. The possibility of a virus being concerned cannot be disregarded, nor can the likelihood of one or more of the "normal" udder bacteria becoming pathogenic be ignored. In two of the five cases the disease was heralded by an increase in the cell content of the milk a month or two before other symptoms appeared. This indicates that the causal factor was probably active in the quarters for some time before the natural resistance of the udder was overcome. (viii) Micro-organisms. The bacterial counts for all quarters were uniformly low during the first lactation, but when once micro-organisms were established in the udder they increased progressively with successive lactations. An abnormal increase in both bacteria and cells was observed in those quarters that were affected with non-specific mastitis or showed evidence of secretory disturbance. High bacterial count was frequently, though not invariably, found to be accompanied by a high cellular content of the milk. Poor quality milk was not necessarily characterized by high bacterial and cell content. Where the abnormalities in the milk were found to be due to hereditary factors, bad conformation of the udder and seasonal effects, the bacterial and cell counts were frequently very low. Micro-organisms may be concerned in the production of non-specific mastitis, for instance by (a) an abnormally big increase in the number of ''normal'' udder bacteria; (b) one or more of these ''normal'' bacteria becoming pathogenic; (c) or after the initial resistance of the udder has been broken down by a more potent agent they may assume the role of secondary invaders and provide a constant source of mild irritation which is responsible for the permanent deterioration in the quality of the milk produced by the affected quarters.

40|$|Chapter 1 The Ebro basin is {{situated}} in north-eastern Spain and forms a geographic unit bounded by high mountains. The Bardenas area lies in the Ebro basin and forms part of the Bardenas Alto - Aragón irrigation scheme, {{which was designed to}} make use of the surface water resources from the Pyrenees. Chapter 2 The Ebro basin is a tertiary sedimentation basin in which the Ebro river and its main tributaries have incised alluvial valleys. The tertiary sediments consist mainly of mudstone, locally with interbedded gypsum layers, and very fine siltstone. Both sedimentary rocks are fine textured and, because they were deposited in a brackish lacustrine environment, contain harmful soluble salts. The main landscape-forming processes were erosion, transport, and deposition under semi-arid climatic conditions. The highest parts of the landscape consist of old tertiary formations which form the uplands of a dissected plain. At a lower level mesas occur, which consist of coarse alluvium covering the underlying tertiary sediments. Most of the eroded sediments were removed from the area but local sedimentation also occurred. Owing to the semi-arid conditions, both sediments and salts were deposited. The highest salt concentrations are found in the lowest parts of the alluvial formations, especially where the alluvium was derived from the eroded mudstone and siltstone. Between the residual uplands and the low-lying alluvial formations, piedmont and colluvial slopes occur. Within the Bardenas area ten major physiographic units were defined, each of them subdivided into minor components and indicated on the soil map. The Ebro basin is the driest part of northern Spain. The climate is semi-arid and becomes drier from the borders to the centre of the depression. The seasonal variation in temperature is great. Potential evapotranspiration exceeds total precipitation, which is extremely variable and is not concentrated in distinct rainy seasons. Wind velocity is high and both cold and warm dry winds are common. Evaporation thus occurs even in winter when temperatures are low. A great part of the area is cultivated, so that natural vegetation is restricted to residual and eroded soils not used for agriculture and to salt-affected soils where halophytes grow. Irrigated farming is influenced by soil conditions. Salt-free soils are under full irrigation, the main crops being maize, lucerne, sugar beet, and some horticultural crops. The cropping pattern on the saline soils depends on the degree of salinity. Barley and sugar beet are grown on moderately saline soils and lucerne on succesfully leached soils. On the higher lands, not under the command of the irrigation scheme, barley is grown. Chapter 3 The study area comprises two drainage basins. The northern part drains to the Aragón river, the southern part to the Riguel river, which is a tributary of the Arba river. Drainage and salinity of the groundwater depend on the situation of each geomorphological unit and its relation to adjacent units. The groundwater in the fluvio-colluvial formations of the northern basin is shallow and highly saline. An ephemeral perched water table is found in the mesas, where the groundwater is non-saline. No shallow water table was found in other physiographic units. The irrigation water is of good quality as its EC is at the lower end of the C 2 -range. The SAR is also in the lowest range S 1 and the RSC is zero, so there is no danger of alkalinization. Chapter 4 The physiographic approach was used to prepare the soil map. Each mapping unit is a broad association of soils having similar salinity hazards and possibilities of reclamation. Five main soil associations were distinguished:a) The residual soils of the siltstone outcrops, which have only a thin surface horizon overlying the hard siltstone. b) The soils of the mesas, which consist of a reddish loamy surface horizon overlying semi-consolidated coarse alluvium rich in calcium- carbonate but free of other salts. This in turn overlies the impervious mudstone. Texture and depth of the soil profile vary. Where moderately deep soils occur. a prosperous irrigated agriculture flourishes. c) The soils of the piedmont and colluvial slopes were developed from a mixture of fine colluvium. and material from the underlying tertiary sediments. They are generally deep and fine textured and have an intrinsic, though variable, salinity, increasing with depth. Because of the low permeability and the salinity of the subsoil, the most suitable irrigation method is sprinkling. d) The non-saline soils of the alluvial valleys of the main rivers. Soil conditions vary greatly, but the older terrace soils are usually shallower and less suitable for irrigation than the youngest deeper (alluvial) soils. In general, prosperous irrigated agriculture exists on these soils. e) The saline alluvial and fluvio-colluvial soils of valleys and fans, whose parent material was derived from denudation of the tertiary sediments. Soil conditions and the degree of salinity vary in each mapping unit, and consequently the possibilities of reclamation vary as well. Chapter 5 The source of the salts is the intrinsic salinity of the parent materials and the secondary salinization in water-receiving areas that lack natural drainage. Under irrigation the mobilization and redistribution of salts continues and salinity increases. The saline soils of the area are mainly affected by sodium chloride, a component dominant in all samples. In addition, calcium and magnesium sulphates are found in the northern basin, while in the southern part, calcium and magnesium chlorides predominate over the sulphates. The SAR increases with the rise of EC. Soil alkalinity can therefore be regarded as a reflection of soil salinity since highly saline soils are sodic as well. Non-saline alkali soils were not found and pH-values greater than 8. 5 do not occur. The results of crop tolerance field tests correspond well with the generally accepted levels for salt tolerance. The continued use of the slightly saline soils can be ensured by maintaining the present drainage system of open ditches and interceptor drains, and by keeping the soils under full irrigation. The normal percolation losses associated with basin irrigation will be sufficient to leach the salts from the rootzone. Sprinkler irrigation is suitable for the soils of the slopes, since no levelling is needed and the small water applications reduce the seepage of saline water. The only drainage system required is an interceptor drain between the slope and the adjacent valley. Chapter 6 The saline alluvial soils require reclamation. For this purpose, they must be provided with a drainage system, followed by initial leaching to reduce their salt content. Because there was no local experience with such drainage and desalinization processes, it was decided to conduct an experimental reclamation. Two experimental fields were subsequently selected. The Alera field represents the poorly drained soils of the fluvio-colluvial formations of the northern basin. These are silty-clay soils whose porosity and permeability decrease with depth. Below a depth of 1. 5 m the soil becomes almost impermeable. Salinity increases with depth, reaching values of between 20 and 35 mmhos/cm in the almost impermeable layer. Soil salinity in the surface layer varies. The Valareña field represents the saline soils of alluvial valleys and fans in the southern drainage basin. These are silty clay loam soils showing a marked stratification. At a depth of 2. 5 m, coarse alluvium saturated with very saline groundwater occurs overlying impervious mudstone. Because of stratification, the hydraulic conductivity is highly anisotropic. Soil salinity is more uniformly distributed than in the Alera soils. The reclamation process consisted of the following phases:a) Theoretical design of the drainage system based on hydrological soil properties measured by conventional field methods and on assumed drainage criteria. b) Implementation of the drainage system in the experimental fields. c) Collection of field data, followed by determination of the actual hydrological soil properties and of the drainage criteria. d) Design of the definitive drainage system which will form the basis of recommendations for the reclamation of saline soils with similar conditions. Chapter 7 After a detailed hydropedological survey, a drain spacing of 20 m at a depth of 1. 5 m was calculated for both the Alera and the Valareña drainage systems. Both fields were subsoiled to a depth of 50 cm to improve their low infiltration rates. Piezometers were installed to monitor the water table. Precipitation was measured, as were the amounts of irrigation and drainage water. Soil samples were taken at fixed sites to determine the salinity during the leaching process. Chapter 8 At the Valareña field, water flowed directly into the drain trench through the upper layer of soil, in which the stratification had been disrupted by levelling and subsoiling. Below this layer, there was no percolation of water and therefore no desalinization. These soils cannot be leached merely by the provision of a drainage system but also require deep subsoiling. At the Alera field, unsteady groundwater flow prevailed. At the end of tail recession, flow conditions approached those of steady flow. The discharge/hydraulic head relation had a parabolic shape showing that flow was restricted to the soil above drain level because the drains had been placed just above the impervious layer. The Boussinesq theory was very suitable to study the drainage of the Alera field. At the end of tail recession, if the term for flow below drain level was disregarded, the Hooghoudt equation could be applied. Drainable pore space was determined from the fall of the water table and the amount of drainage water during periods of low evapotranspiration. An average value of 4 per cent was found. The hydraulic conductivity was calculated from the discharge/hydraulic head relation using the Boussinesq and Hooghoudt equations for periods of low evapotranspiration. In general good agreement was found among the values obtained. It could thus be concluded that:- Hydraulic conductivity decreases with depth, becoming negligible below drain level. - The hydraulic conductivity between a depth of 0. 5 m and drain level equals about 0. 6 m/day, and is about 1. 5 m/day in the upper layer. - For high water table conditions, the average hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile is 1 m/day. A comparison of hydraulic conductivity values obtained with field and laboratory methods and those obtained from the discharge/hydraulic head relation showed that:- The results obtained with the auger hole method (K = 0. 2 m/day) were lower than those derived from the discharge/hydraulic head relation. - No satisfactory results were obtained from the inversed auger hole measurements above the water table. - The results obtained from laboratory measurements in undisturbed soil cores showed the anisotropy of the soil. The entrance resistance (W e) of different combinations of drainage and filter materials was calculated from the drain discharge and the head loss of the water table measured in the drain trench (h i). Another method, by which the head loss in the trench was calculated from the shape of the water table was also applied. Both methods gave similar results, yielding the following conclusions:- The W e -values remained fairly constant with time, except for plastic pipes-with an envelope of esparto or coconut fibre for which an increase in W e was observed. - The best combination was clay pipes with a gravel cover (W e = 2 day/m). - Corrugated PVC-pipes with gravel covering and clay pipes without gravel may be used also (W e = 5 day/m). - Corrugated plastic pipes without a filter gave less satisfactory results (W e = 13 day/m). - Plastic pipes with coconut fibre and esparto filters showed an even higher W e than plastic pipes without a filter. - Barley straw is an unsuitable cover material since it rots easily and clogs the pipe. Chapter 9 The desalinization of the Alera field started with an initial leaching, followed by the irrigated cultivation of moderately salt- resistant crops. The leaching efficiency coefficient was determined by comparing the actual desalinization process with theoretical models. Thus the leaching requirement could be predicted for different initial salt contents. To exclude the influence of slightly soluble salts, the desalinization curves were drawn in terms of chloride content. The correlation between <b>chloride</b> <b>percentage</b> and electrical conductivity was high. The following conclusions emerged from the study of the leaching process:- The leaching efficiency coefficient was not constant but increased with depth. - The leaching efficiency coefficient was higher at the beginning of the desalinization process and decreased gradually as the soil became less saline. - The calculated values reflected the differences in soil structure. - An average value of 0. 5 was determined for the upper layer (0 - 50 cm), and a value of 1. 0 for the deeper layer (50 - 100 cm). - The initial salinity was related to soil physical properties (infiltration rate and permeability) which, in turn, were dependent on the compactness of the soil. - For an initial EC e of 15 mmhos/cm, approximately 1000 mm of percolation water are required, which meant 1100 to 1400 mm of irrigation water. The leaching period could last up to 8 months, from early autumn to late May. - Deep subsoiling and local gypsum applications improved the structure of the upper soil layer. - The leaching of saline soils could be split into two phases: an initial leaching of the upper layer, followed by the irrigated cultivation of a moderately salt-resistant crop (sugar beet), during which percolation losses leached the deeper layers. - There was no risk of alkalinization during the leaching period. - To prevent secondary salinization after reclamation, good drainage conditions must be maintained and an irrigated crop rotation practised. Chapter 10 From the relation between the depth of the water table, crop growth, and the mobility of agricultural machinery on the soil, and from a study of the groundwater regime in winter and during the irrigation season drainage criteria for unsteady-state conditions were derived. These criteria were converted to steady-state criteria for easier use in drainage projects. The following conclusions could be drawn from the study:- Little harm is done to winter cereals if a water table remains within a depth of 50 cm, for no more than 3 consecutive days. - With a water table between 75 and 100 cm, sugar beet grows well and is not harmed if a water table is within the top 50 cm for 3 to 4 consecutive days. - Lucerne is more sensitive than sugar beet to high water tables. For good yields, a water table must not remain longer than 3 days within the top 25 cm of soil, 4 or 5 days within the top 50 cm, and 5 or 6 days within the top 75 cm. - A water table depth shallower than 65 cm prevents the movement of machinery and hampers seed-bed preparation in winter. The following drainage criteria were assessed:a) In winter, a water table drawdown from the soil surface to a depth of 0. 65 m in 8 days. b) In the irrigation season, a water table rise of 0. 7 m caused by irrigation losses must be lowered in the 12 days between two consecutive irrigations, and must be deeper than 0. 7 m after 7 days. Applying these criteria in the Boussinesq equation for unsteady flow and using the values for hydraulic conductivity and drainable pore space determined at the experimental field, a spacing of 25 m for drains installed at a depth of 1. 2 m was obtained. Equivalent drainage criteria for steady flow are a minimum depth of 0. 5 m for the unsaturated zone, with a corresponding hydraulic head midway between drains of 0. 7 m and a drain discharge of 3 mm/day. If the entrance resistance was taken into account, the Ernst equation for steady flow and the Hellinga/de Zeeuw equation for unsteady flow could be used in calculating the drain spacing. The results obtained by both approaches agree well and allowed the following conclusions:- For drainage and filter materials with a high entrance resistance, the drain density (m/ha) required becomes twice that needed for materials with low entrance resistance. - Material with high entrance resistance involves much more risk of failure than a wider spacing with good material...|$|E

The estimates of phenotypic coefficients of variation (PCV) were high and moderate for plant height (18. 16 %), number of leaves (15. 96 %), leaf area index (27. 35 %), internodal length (21. 01 %), stem diameter (16. 73 %), grade index (13. 86 %), nicotine percentage (19. 87 %), total soluble sugars (39. 81 %), chlorides (23. 35 %) and leaf yield (13. 27 %) in MAGIC-F 2 segregating populations at NLS 2015 season. High heritability coupled with high and moderate genetic advance was observed for all the traits studied. Correlation studies revealed that total soluble sugars was positively and significantly correlated with leaf area index, stem diameter, grade index and leaf yield. However total soluble sugars was negatively correlated with nicotine as total nicotine alkaloid and with <b>chlorides</b> <b>percentage.</b> Path coefficient analysis revealed that total percentage of sugars could be improved through selection of grade index, stem diameter, leaf area index and cured leaf yield which were positively correlated with total soluble sugar percentage.

30|$|Saturated {{release of}} the anions is {{in the order of}} {{phosphate}} > carbonate > sulfate > <b>chloride</b> with <b>percentages</b> of saturated release of 75 %, 40 %, 27 %, and 11 %, respectively. The highest saturated release of 3, 4 -D in the PO 43 − aqueous solution is due to the high charge density of the anion (PO 43 −), whereas the lowest saturated release of 3, 4 -D was in the aqueous solution containing Cl−. This shows that the saturated release for the aqueous media toward the anion encapsulates in LDH agreed with the previous work by Miyata et al. [26]. This result suggests that the charge density of the anion to be exchanged with 3, 4 -D plays a vital role in determining the saturated {{release of the}} 3, 4 -D from the nanohybrid into the aqueous media.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 In {{recent years}} nuclear {{reduction}} of pyrimidines by catalytic hydrogenation in acid media {{has been considered}} a possible synthetic method for the preparation of substituted tetrahydropyrimidines. This technique {{has the advantage of}} simplicity over the older condensation methods and is limited only by the preparation of the appropriately substituted pyrimidines. During an investigation of the scope of this nuclear reduction technique, Aft and Christensen found that the tetrahydropyrimidines could not be isolated in pure form as the hydrochloride salts, as shown by deviations between the corresponding actual and theoretical <b>chloride</b> <b>percentages.</b> These surprising results suggested that the nuclear reduction reaction in acid media was not straightforward, contrary to the results of earlier studies, but yield mixtures as shown by paper chromatographic analysis consisting of degradation products along with the desired tetrahydropyrimidine. In order to get {{a better understanding of the}} nature of this nuclear reduction reaction, an investigation was undertaken to identify the corresponding degradation products of one of these nuclear reductions. 4 -Amino- 2, 6 -dichloropyrimidine was chosen for the investigation since it was found by Aft and Christensen to undergo considerable degradation during nuclear reduction. 4 -Amino- 2, 6 -dichloropyrimidine upon nuclear reduction would be expected to yield 4 -amino- 3, 4, 5, 6 -tetrahydropyrimidine which upon decomposition could form low molecular weight products such as methylamine, propylamine, ammonia, propanol, etc. which should be easily detected by gas-chromatography. Upon basification of the isolated hydrochloride salts of the reduction products basic material was collected which was found to contain five components by gas chromatography, four of which were identified as ammonia, n-propylamine, propionaldehyde, and n-propanol. Gas chromatographic analysis of the reaction mixture before isolation of the hydrochloride salts showed that carbon dioxide, but not propionaldehyde and n-propanol, was among the reduction products. It was, therefore, concluded that propionaldehyde and n-propanol must have been formed by basic hydrolysis of the tetrahydropyrimidine set free during basification of the hydrochloride salts, and a mechanism was postulated for the formation of ammonia, n-propylamine, and carbon dioxide during nuclear reduction of 4 -amino- 2, 6 -dichloropyrimidine. According to this mechanism, 4 -amino- 3, 4, 5, 6 -tetrahydropyrimidine undergoes hydrolysis in the aqueous acid media yielding the degradation products, accounting for both the low yields and impure nature of this tetrahydropyrimidine obtainable from the nuclear reduction reaction...|$|R

Concrete columns of bridges, {{which are in}} frequent contact with sea water, are an example of these structures. Understanding the chloride transport in cementitious materials can lead to improving their durability. In this paper, the chloride transport driven by moisture transport in various specimens is compared experimentally. Standard mortar specimens, with a water cement ratio of 0. 5, are immersed into sodium chloride solutions to obtain specimens with the <b>chloride</b> mass <b>percentage</b> of 2. 0 %.

The results show that the chloride concentration measurement with Titration and Ion Chromatography are similar while the measurement with XRF is approximately 30 % higher. Furthermore, due to the moisture transport through the specimen during 10 months, the total chloride content of the specimen seems to be decreased.

Local ozone sensitivity was established using the HCHO/NO 2 ratio and this area {{was found to be}} sensitive to both VOCs and NOx. Carbonyls accounted for 35 % of O 3 formation estimated using the MIR scale. Lake breeze events had no significant impact on carbonyl concentrations in this location. In the second part of this dissertation, aerosol concentrations and composition were obtained along the coast of California using a High-Resolution Time-of-Flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-AMS) onboard RV Atlantis during CalNex in 2010. Measured submicron aerosols were dominated by particulate sulfate and particulate organic matter (pOM), which accounted for 86 % of all measured submicron aerosol mass. High aerosol concentrations were associated with land breezes from polluted cities while low concentrations were observed with sea breezes. For the first time, a method is proposed to establish non-refractory particulate chloride (NR p-Cl) in ambient air that is enriched with sea salt chloride.

40|$|Aerosol {{composition}} and concentration measurements {{along the coast}} of California were obtained using an Aerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-AMS) onboard the research vessel Atlantis during the CalNex study in 2010. This paper focuses on the measurement of aerosol chloride using the HR-AMS that can be ambiguous in regions with significant quantities of sea salt aerosols. This ambiguity arises due to large differences in the sensitivity of the HR-AMS to refractory chloride species (i. e., NaCl) and non refractory chloride species (i. e., NH 4 Cl, HCl, etc.). Using the HR-AMS, the aerosol chloride signal is typically quantified using ion signals for 35 Cl +, H 35 Cl +, 37 Cl + and H 37 Cl + (H x Cl +). During this study, the highest aerosol chloride signal was observed during sea sweep experiments when the source of the aerosol chloride was NaCl present in artificially generated sea salt aerosols even though the HR-AMS has significantly lower sensitivity to such refractory species. Other prominent ion signals that arise from NaCl salt were also observed at m/z 22. 99 for Na + and m/z 57. 96 for Na 35 Cl + during both sea sweep experiments and during periods of ambient measurements. Thus, refractory NaCl contributes significantly to the H x Cl + signal, interfering with attempts to quantify non sea salt chloride (nssCl). It was found that during ambient aerosol measurements, the interference in the H x Cl + signal from sea salt chloride (ssCl) was as high as 89 %, but with a study wide average of 10 %. The Na 35 Cl + ion signal was found to be a good tracer for NaCl. We outline a method to establish nssCl in the ambient aerosols by subtracting the sea salt chloride (ssCl) signal from the H x Cl + signal. The ssCl signal is derived from the Na 35 Cl + ion tracer signal and the H x Cl + to Na 35 Cl + ratio established from the sea sweep experiments. Ambient submicron concentrations of ssCl were also established using the Na 35 Cl + ion tracer signal and a scaling factor determined through simultaneous measurements of submicron aerosol chloride on filters. This scaling factor accounts for the low vaporization response of the AMS heater to ssCl, although regular calibration of this response is recommended in future applications. It follows that true total particulate chloride (pCl) is the sum of nssCl and ssCl. In this study, the median levels observed for the concentrations of pCl, nssCl and ssCl were 0. 052, 0. 017 and 0. 024 μg m − 3 respectively. The average contributions of nssCl and ssCl to pCl were 48 and 52 % respectively, with nssCl dominating in periods of continental outflow and ssCl dominating during other periods. Finally, we propose a method to measure <b>percentage</b> <b>chloride</b> depletion of NaCl in ambient submicron sea salt aerosols, strictly using the AMS measurements of Na + and Na 35 Cl + ion signals.
