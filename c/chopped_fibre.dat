50|$|Fibre fabrics are web-form fabric {{reinforcing}} material that has both {{warp and weft}} directions. Fibre mats are web-form non-woven mats of glass fibres. Mats are manufactured in cut dimensions with chopped fibres, or in continuous mats using continuous fibres. <b>Chopped</b> <b>fibre</b> glass is used in processes where lengths of glass threads are cut between 3 and 26 mm, threads are then used in plastics most commonly intended for moulding processes.

50|$|The basic {{reinforcement}} {{material for}} this process is glass-fibre rovings, which are chopped to a length of 10 to 40 mm and then applied on the mould. For improved mechanical properties, a combination of fabric and <b>chopped</b> <b>fibre</b> layers is used. The most common material type is E-glass, but carbon and Kevlar rovings can also be used. Continuous strand mat, fabric, and various types of core materials are embedded by hand whenever required. The weight fraction of reinforcement in this process is typically 20 to 40% of the total weight of the part. The most common resin system used for the spray-up process is general purpose or DCDP polyester; isophthalic polyesters and vinylesters are also sometimes used. Fast-reacting resins with a pot life of 30 to 40 minutes are typical. The resin often contains {{a significant amount of}} filler. The most common fillers are calcium carbonates and aluminium trihydrates. In filled resin systems, fillers replace some of the reinforcements; 5 to 25% filler is used by weight.|$|E

Nanoclays (Cloisite 15 A) of 1 wt. % to 5 wt. % were filled in polypropylene (PP) matrix and they were subjected to fracture toughness studies. The specimen with 5 wt. % nanoclay showed 1. 75 times and 3 times improvement in critical stress intensity factor (KIC) and strain energy release rate (GIC), respectively, over virgin PP. On the other hand, 3 wt. % nanoclay PP composites showed superior crack containment properties. These structural changes of composite specimens were examined using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods. It showed that exfoliated nanocomposite structures were formed up to 3 wt. % nanoclay, whereas, intercalated nanocomposite structures formed above 3 wt. % nanoclay in the PP matrix. Furthermore, the woven fibre reinforced PP composites demonstrated superior crack resistant properties than that of clay filled nanocomposites and <b>chopped</b> <b>fibre</b> PP composites. However, KIC and GIC values for woven fibre composites were lesser than that of <b>chopped</b> <b>fibre</b> composites.

Therefore, {{it is essential to}} investigate the feasibility of using by-product recycled materials as aggregates to maintain the concrete construction industry. Several types of recyclable materials are currently used in concrete. One of the potential resources of recycled concrete is steel slag. Knowing that Steel slag is the most significant solid waste generated by Qatar Steel Company in Qatar, replacing of natural coarse aggregate with steel slag aggregate will have a significant environmental and economic impact to the state of Qatar. This paper presents the compression and flexural test results of different concrete mixes made of steel slag coarse aggregate combined with a newly developed basalt <b>chopped</b> <b>fibres.</b> The parameters investigated included the volume fraction of the fibre used and the type of coarse aggregates (natural aggregates “Gabbro” and steel slag aggregates). Plain concrete specimens containing natural coarse aggregates and steel slag aggregates with no fibres added were also tested to serve as control.

Powder formulations were grinded using Rocklabs grinder and epoxy-mixed using Caframo mixer, where the maximum speed used was 150 rpm and later hand-applied onto primer coated carbon steel substrates at room temperature.

40|$|Random glass-mat {{thermoplastic}} (GMT) composites {{are used}} in automotive applications due to their mechanical properties and low processing cost. However, there is an inherent issue in that the thermoplastic matrices exhibit viscoelastic behaviour. In order for manufacturers to have confidence in their products, {{it is important to}} be able to predict the long-term behaviour of these materials. In this work, chopped glass fibre mat reinforced polypropylene was studied over a stress range at room temperature. Through short-term creep experiments, a material variability of ± 18 % was determined. One day creep experiments indicated the presence of viscoplastic damage in the composite, which was verified using microscopy. The creep deformation has been modeled using a viscoelastic-viscoplastic model. To verify the model, two creep tests of 33 day duration were conducted. The test results agreed well with the model. The temperature effects and applicability of time-temperature superposition (TTS) have been investigated. Parametric studies conducted suggest that the failure modes for <b>chopped</b> <b>fibre</b> composite become matrix dominated at temperatures higher than the secondary glass transition of 60 °C. Through the development of a master curve based on 20 MPa data, it was shown that TTS is applicable to the composite. Short-term tests indicated that the material response of <b>chopped</b> <b>fibre</b> mat composites is far too random to be meaningfully quantified and this is further exacerbated at higher temperatures. From 1 day creep tests at various temperatures, it was seen that temperature appears to increase plastic strain in the material exponentially. By comparing the results from these tests to micrographs of the material, it showed that above the secondary glass transition, bulk deformation of the matrix phase in the composite is dominant due to matrix softening. Deformation of the matrix phase accelerates fibre-matrix debonding and therefore the progressive failure process. Overall, there is evidence that even for materials with inherently high property scatter, it is possible to identify the effects of nonlinearities arising from external factors using short-term creep tests on single specimens. It is, however, more difficult to develop an accurate long-term model that can account for stress and temperature conditions because of the wild experimental scatter...|$|E
40|$|A new adsorbent, {{microporous}} polyethylene <b>chopped</b> <b>fibre,</b> {{was produced}} {{from a high}} density polyethylene. This can adsorb lipopolysaccharides (LPS) linearly up to 2 h, and showed the highest capacity to adsorb LPS when compared with two other polyethylene-based adsorbents and a polystyrene-based adsorbent. More {{than twice as much}} orange II and 4 -nitroquinoline N oxide were adsorbed in the new adsorbent as was LPS. The adsorption isotherm of the new adsorbent for LPS was of Ln type, the correlation between adsorption and concentration of solute was proportional; whereas orange II and 4 -nitroquinoline N oxide were of L type (greater adsorption than Ln type); tetrachloroethylene adsorption was of S type, less than Ln type. Adsorption of LPS to the new adsorbent increased when temperature rose, whereas adsorption of orange II and 4 -nitroquinoline N oxide decreased. These data suggest that the binding of LPS to the new adsorbent is a hydrophobic interaction, whereas the binding of both orange II and 4 -nitroquinoline N oxide is not.

40|$|The current {{research}} is part of a wider experimental program on creep modeling of glass mat reinforced polypropylene composites which are increasingly being used in molding automotive parts. This specific study is focused on the dimensional and thermal stability of <b>chopped</b> <b>fibre</b> mat and long fibre mat composites. The objective of the study is two-fold. First, to characterize in-situ the micro-failure mechanisms associated with damage accumulation during creep at room temperature and at service temperature (80 °C) for stresses up to 67 % of the ultimate tensile strength. Second, to characterize the effects of prolonged exposure at elevated temperature on the crystallinity and chemical degradation of the polypropylene matrix. In {{the first part of the}} investigation, micro-failure mechanisms including fibre-matrix interface, matrix yielding and cracking during the creep process have been captured in-situ using reflection microscopy. Specimens with 12 mm gauge length were mounted onto a Minimat tensile tester. The applied stress levels of interest were 33 % and 67 % of the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) at room temperature (RT) and high temperature (HT), respectively. It was found that the deformation mechanisms do not change with temperature but creep in the <b>chopped</b> <b>fibre</b> material is substantially higher than that in the long-fibre. Creep deformation is typically associated with multiple transverse crack initiation at the fibre-matrix interface, crack crazing and rapid coalescence of the small cracks leading to abrupt fracture. Debonding of the fibres is usually detected at the loading stage of the test but fibre breakage is minimal even at high temperature. The change in creep strain at room temperature is similar for both composites but creep strains are highly sensitive to the fibre-mat type at higher temperature. Long-fibre mat structures offer greater creep resistance. Micro-indentations on the matrix-rich regions showed elongation along the loading direction but shear yielding (distortion of indentations) was not noticeable. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the fibre pullout was observed to be pronounced thus suggesting poor adhesion at the fibre-matrix interface. In the second part of this study, the effects of elevated temperature aging on the microstructural changes of isotactic polypropylene matrix in a composite have been studied using wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The objective was to quantify small and slow changes in crystallinity due to thermal aging. To minimize sample variability, polypropylene resin was extracted from the molded composite plaque. Changes in crystallinity level and crystalline form were detected using WAXS after prolonged aging at 90 and 140 °C. FTIR was utilized to monitor in-situ crystallinity changes and to detect oxidation products due to thermal decomposition. The level of crystallinity was monitored by changes in the absorbance ratio of A 997 /A 973 and A 841 /A 973; the former ratio was found to be more sensitive for detecting crystallinity changes. Aging at 140 °C resulted in oxidation. The kinetics of secondary crystallization for the aging conditions studied was characterized using Avrami plots...|$|E

A previous study utilising ‘single fibre’ fragmentation tests found that coating with magnesium improved the fibre and matrix interfacial shear strength. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a magnesium coating on the manufacture and characterisation of a random <b>chopped</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced polycaprolactone composite. Short chopped strand non-woven phosphate glass fibre mats were sputter coated with degradable magnesium to manufacture phosphate glass fibre/polycaprolactone composites. The degradation behaviour (water uptake, mass loss and pH change of the media) of these polycaprolactone composites as well as of pure polycaprolactone was investigated in phosphate buffered saline. The Mg coated fibre reinforced composites revealed less water uptake and mass loss during degradation compared to the non-coated composites. The cations released were also explored and a lower ion release profile for all three cations investigated (namely Na+, Mg 2 + and Ca 2 +) was seen for the Mg coated composite samples. An increase of 17 % in tensile strength and 47 % in tensile modulus was obtained for the Mg coated composite samples. Both flexural and tensile properties were investigated and a higher retention {{of mechanical}} properties was obtained for the Mg coated fibre reinforced composite samples up to 10 days immersion in PBS.

Composite and resin samples have been characterised both dry as moulded and after conditioning at either 120 °C or 150 °C for a range of times up to 1000 hours. The results reveal that hydrothermal ageing in water-glycol mixtures results in significant changes in the mechanical performance, weight, and dimensions of these materials. The negative effects of conditioning could be mitigated to some degree by the appropriate choice of the glass fibre sizing; however the sizing effect diminished with increasing conditioning time. All materials showed a weight increase due to conditioning at 120 °C which was typical of a single Fickian diffusion process and there was clear evidence of multiple processes involved when conditioning at 150 °C. It was not apparent that the glass fibre sizing affected the dimensional stability of the composites. We show that there is a strong correlation between the swelling of these samples and the level of fluid adsorption. Although the PA 66 resin showed reasonably homogeneous swelling, the composites exhibited different levels of swelling depending on direction. These effects were well in line with the known effects of fibres on restriction of the matrix deformation (mechanical, thermal or moisture swelling) in the fibre direction. These differences correlate well with the average fibre orientation with respect to the various direction axes. Composite tensile strength and unnotched impact resistance appeared to scale inversely with the level of swelling of the material...|$|E

40|$|This project {{involves}} {{the design and}} construction of a fibre cutter {{which can be used}} to chop different types of fibres in order to produce alternative composite materials. <b>Chopped</b> <b>fibre</b> is needed in the production of composite materials for the automotive industry and other sectors. Bulk Moulding Compound (BMC) and Sheet Moulding Compound (SMC) are the most commonly used processes. The process uses chopped glass fibre to produce light composite materials. Currently, the market offers many alternatives to quickly cut glass fibre. However, these methods cannot be used with alternative fibres which are more difficult to handle, so a new fibre cutter is needed to cut alternative fibres and produce new materials which can offer lighter, and more sustainable reinforcement alternatives than glass fibre. The chosen solution has been the modification of an existing fibreglass chopper gun, which was able to cut glass fibre at different lengths with its cutting wheels, but could not cut other types of fibres. After the adaption of the conceptual design to the existing chopper gun, the gun arrangement was able to cut carbon fibre successfully, and is also capable of cutting some types of coated rayon fibre. In order to prove the usefulness of this new design, the chopper gun has been used to cut carbon fibre to produce alternative BMC materials, where, remarkably, that the cutting process just needed 72 seconds to produce 475 grams of chopped carbon fibre. These alternative BMC materials have been tested and compared with conventional glass fibre BMC compounds, demonstrating superior mechanical properties and lower density.

40|$|The work {{involved}} {{studies of}} two separate aspects of natural fibre composites. The {{first part of}} the work examined the use of high aspect ratio short fibres in thermoplastic matrix composites. This required that the technical fibres were first broken down into elementary fibres. Kenaf fibres were used {{in this part of the}} study with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) as the matrix. Several different treatments were examined for isolating the elementary fibres from the technical fibres, the most successful being 60 % nitric acid treatment and 20 % hydrogen peroxide/glacial acetic acid treatment. The hydrogen peroxide/acetic acid treatment produced full length elementaries with an average length of 2. 3 mm and an average aspect ratio of 180. However, the nitric acid treatment caused fragmentation of the elementary fibres resulting in an average length of only 0. 2 mm and an average aspect ratio of 15. It also caused an increase in the defect density of the fibres. Both treatments increased the cellulose crystallinity but caused some oxidation of the fibres. The elementary fibres were used to produce HDPE composites with a 40 wt% fibre fraction. The behaviour of these composites was then compared with that of composites of the same fibre fraction, prepared using chopped technical fibres with an average length of 0. 7 mm and an average aspect ratio of 8. Breakup of the elementaries occurred during extrusion reducing the fibre length by as much as a factor of 10. However, the chopped technical fibres were unaffected. No improvement in modulus or strength over that of the <b>chopped</b> <b>fibre</b> composites was obtained for the nitric acid treated fibre composites, due to the very low fibre aspect ratio. However, an improvement of 20 % in both modulus and strength was obtained for the hydrogen peroxide/acetic acid treated fibre composites. The second part of the work examined the suitability of using the results obtained from single fibre testing and from flat fibre bundle testing to predict the tensile properties of unidirectional composites made from the fibres. Flax fibres were used in this part of the study. Unidirectional composites were prepared with a fibre volume fraction of 25 % using vinyl ester as the matrix resin. The modulus and strength obtained by backing out the fibre properties from tensile data obtained from the composites were both within 7 % of those obtained from single fibre testing, once proper account was taken of the true fibre cross sectional shape and the effect of fibre length on fibre strength. The flat fibre bundle tests gave values which were only 43 % of the single fibre data.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{performance}} of specific rotomoulded products being developed at a local company, reinforcement of the hollow core of the products with reaction injection moulded polyurethane (RIM PU) foam was investigated. Improvement of the foam mechanical properties was also investigated, with density variation {{and the addition of}} short glass fibre reinforcement. Testing showed the foam's mechanical properties were not directly relative to density. When foam density was doubled from 300 to 600 kg/m 3, the tensile strength increased by a factor of 2. 7 and the modulus by a factor of 2. 5. For ME 1020 (fibre type) 6 mm <b>chopped</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced foam, these increases were larger, at factors of 3. 0 and 2. 6 for strength and modulus, respectively. For 300 kg/m 3 foam, fibre made negligible difference to the tensile strength, but the ME 1020 reinforced foam was found to have 29 % higher modulus than the neat foam at the same density (for 5 wt% fibre composites). The 101 C (fibre type) reinforced foam performed poorly, even showing a decrease in strength when compared to the neat foam at 600 kg/m 3 (for 5 wt% fibre composites). The bending creep properties of reinforced foam was found to be higher than that of the neat foam in most cases, with ME 1020 fibre composite foam performing better than 101 C fibre reinforced composites in all cases. 5 wt% ME 1020 fibre reinforced foam was found to have impact strengths over twice that of neat foams at the same density. Impact strength improvements were also seen for 101 C fibre reinforced foam, but to a lesser extent for both foam densities tested. Morphological analysis of foam tensile fracture surfaces was undertaken and many interesting observations were made. Features such as cell elongation and fibre alignment with the foam flow direction were consistent with foam literature, but some unique features were observed. These include a localised 'string' cell packing trend, and also microscopic areas of localised plastic deformation in cell walls, which were visible as wrinkled surfaces on the foam cell walls. Modification of the (rotomoulded) skin to foam interface was investigated, as this parameter will likely affect the service performance of the whole product. Experimentation with various methods to increase the skin/foam interfacial shear strength was undertaken, and large improvements were attained with methods trialled and developed. These included adding particles to the rotomoulding charge, which became embedded in the inner skin of the moulded part, and protrude from the inner surface. These particles 'key' into the foam which fills the product's hollow core. Other interfacial shear strength improvement concepts for equipment to be developed were also proposed. One concept proposed is an innovative modification to plasma treatment equipment currently available, which could be used to treat the inner surface of hollow products, to improve the bonding between the inner rotomoulded surface and the foam. Another concept is proposed which may oxidise the inner rotomoulded part surface, but, only {{at the very end of}} the rotomoulding cycle, so that the bulk polymer is not degraded. The purpose of this deliberate oxidation is to achieve results similar to those attained by plasma or flame treatment currently used by industry for improving the wettability of PE products...|$|E

This emerging technology will lead to multifunctional composites with possible applications in structural health monitoring and traffic monitoring. The aim is to avoid corrosion problems from metallic components, {{as well as to}} eliminate the need of expensive equipments used for the health monitoring of large infrastructures. In the present research, the strain-sensing capability of a core-reinforced hybrid carbon fibre/glass fibre braided composite has been investigated in order to develop continuous monitoring system.

The effect of core composition (carbon fibre/glass fibre weight ratio) on the strain sensitivity of the braided composites has been studied in order to find out the optimum composition for best sensing capability. Among the three compositions studied (23 / 77, 47 / 53 and 100 / 0), composites with lowest amount of carbon fibre showed the best strain sensitivity with gauge factors up to 23. 4 at very low flexural strain (0. 55 %). Attempts have also been made in this research to develop a piezoresistive matrix for the braided composites in order to further enhance their strain sensitivity. For this purpose, the strain sensing capability of an unsaturated polyester matrix dispersed with <b>chopped</b> carbon <b>fibres</b> (1 mm and 3 mm lengths) at various weight % (0. 5, 0. 75 and 1. 25 %) was evaluated in order to find out their optimum length and concentration. It was observed that <b>chopped</b> <b>fibres</b> with different lengths showed similar strain sensitivity, which however, improves with the decrease in their concentrations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Thermoplastic {{composites}} {{based on}} flax fibres and a polypropylene (PP) matrix were manufactured using (i) a film-stacking method based on random fibre mats and (ii) a paper mak-ing process based on <b>chopped</b> <b>fibres.</b> The influence of fibre length and fibre content on stiffness, strength and impact strength of these so-called natural-fibre-mat-reinforced thermoplastics (NMTs) is reported and compared with data for glass-mat-reinforced thermoplastics (GMTs), including {{the influence of}} the use of maleic-anhydride grafted PP for improved interfacial adhesion. In addition some preliminary data on the influence of fibre diameter on composite stiffness and strength is reported. The data is compared with the existing micro-mechanical models for strength and stiffness. A good agreement was found between theory and experiment in case of stiffness whereas in the case of strength the experimental values fall well below the theoretical predictions. Results indicated that NMTs are of interest for low-cost engineering applications and can compete with commercial GMTs when a high stiffness per unit weight is desirable. Results also indicated that future research towards significant improvements in tensile and impact strength of these types of composites should focus on the optimisation of fibre strength rather than interfacial bond strength...|$|R

To do this, sets of samples are made with rockwool and different percentages of combinations between water / plaster. These series are repeated by changing the additive E glass fibre length of 25 mm to make a comparative analysis with respect to the series infused with rockwool...|$|R
40|$|Fully {{biodegradable}} composites were developed, possessing prominent mechanical {{performance and}} reduced flammability {{at the same}} time. The manufactured composites consisted of PLA/TPS biopolymer matrices reinforced with <b>chopped</b> flax <b>fibres.</b> The flammability of the prepared biocomposites was reduced by a newly synthesized multifunctional additive system. Glycerol phosphate (GP), a plasticizer of starch with flame retardant potential, and a novel phosphorous-silane (PSil), applied as a surface treating agent of the reinforcing biofibres, were successfully combined {{in order to reduce}} the flammability of the prepared biocomposites. Owing to the beneficial effect of the applied multifunctional additive system, a loading of as low as 10 wt...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{reinforcing}} of Poly(lactic acid) with <b>chopped</b> basalt <b>fibres</b> by using silane treated and untreated basalt fibres. Composite materials with 5 &# 8211; 10 &# 8211; 15 &# 8211; 20 &# 8211; 30 &# 8211; 40 wt% basalt fibre contents were prepared from silane sized basalt fibres using extrusion, and injection moulding, while composites with 5 &# 8211; 10 &# 8211; 15 wt% basalt fibre contents were also prepared by using untreated basalt fibres as control. The properties of the injection moulded composites were extensively examined by using quasi-static (tensile, three-point bending) and dynamic mechanical tests (notched and unnotched Charpy impact tests), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), heat deflection temperature (HDT) analysis, dimensional stability test, as well as melt flow index (MFI) analysis and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) observations. It was found that silane treated <b>chopped</b> basalt <b>fibres</b> are much more effective in reinforcing Poly(lactic acid) than natural fibres; although basalt fibres are not biodegradable {{but they are still}} considered as natural (can be found in nature in the form of volcanic rocks) and biologically inert. It is demonstrated in this paper that by using basalt fibre reinforcement, a renewable and natural resource based composite can be produced by injection moulding with excellent mechanical properties suitable even for engineering applications. Finally it was shown that by using adequate drying of the materials, composites with higher mechanical properties can be achieved compared to literature data...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an attempt to}} use betelnut fibres as reinforcement for tribo-polyester composites in bearing applications. The composite was fabricated using the hand layup technique, and contains 15 layers of randomly distributed <b>chopped</b> <b>fibres</b> and 17 layers of polyester. The adhesive wear and frictional behavior of the composites were studied against a polished stainless steel counterface using block-on-disc (BOD) machine at different applied loads (5 - 30 N) and sliding distance (0 - 7 km). In addition to that, {{the orientation of the}} fibre layers with respect to the sliding direction of the counterface was considered, i. e. parallel (P-O), anti-parallel (AP-O) and normal (N-O). Studies on worn surfaces, using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and roughness profiles of the composite and counterface assisted to explain the results. As a result of this work, it was found that applied load has less effect on the specific wear rate and friction coefficient of the composite especially in P-O and AP-O. Meanwhile, in both orientations (P-O and AP-O), the steady state of specific wear rate was reached after 5 km sliding distance. On the other hand, the composite behaved differently in N-O, where the wear and friction increased when the load and sliding distance increased. This was due to the poor support of the fibres in that orientation, where delamination, pull out and breakage in the fibres were observed. In P-O and AP-O, the wear mechanism was predominated by plastic deformation and micro-cracks...|$|R

40|$|The tribo-potential of {{sugarcane}} fibre reinforcement in the thermoset polymers {{for enhancing}} the adhesive wear resistance {{has not been}} explored so far. Hence, the present work aims to explore {{the possibility of using}} this natural fibre to reinforce polyester and thus opens a new way to implement locally available inexpensive fibres and produce a new candidate tribo-material for bearing applications. Sugarcane fibre/polyester (SCRP) and glass fibre/polyester (GRP) composites (with <b>chopped</b> <b>fibres</b> of 1, 5, 10 mm length randomly distributed and unidirectional mat fibres) were prepared using compression mould and hand-lay-up techniques. Friction coefficients and wear rates of SCRP and GRP composites were determined under dry sliding contact conditions in parallel and anti-parallel orientations and subjected to different operating parameters such as load, speed and test duration. Results of friction and wear proved that SCRP composite is a promising composite which can be a competitive to GRP composite. In the case of chopped sugarcane/polyester (C-SCRP) composite, very smooth patches of polymer film (protective layer) due to plastic deformation shielded the surface of C-SCRP composite pin from damage by the metallic asperities and thereby contributed to the higher wear resistance. Furthermore, this layer provided enhancement to the bonding of SCFs fibre with matrix. In contrast C-GRP composite produced broken hard particles of GF at the interface which acted as a third body and restrained the formation of such protective layer. Wear resistance of C-SCRP composite increased significantly with increasing load but decreased drastically for C-GRP composite. In addition, wear rate of C-SCRP composite decreased by (20 - 50...|$|R
40|$|Asbestos fibres, of the {{chrysotile}} variety, and <b>chopped</b> carbon <b>fibres</b> were pretreated by an in-situ polycondensation technique eventually {{resulting in}} a polyamide coating on the fibre surface. Ionomer based composites containing either carbon or asbestos fibres in random in plane fibre orientation were prepared, {{and the influence of}} this coating process on the tensile properties was investigated. It was found that for the asbestos-filled composites the presence of the nylon 6, 6 interlayer improves the tensile performance, especially at moderate polyamide depositions. This is not the case with the pretreated carbon-filled composites for which carbon fibres with higher polyamide contents are preferred. Combinations of the treated asbestos fibres with carbon and/or aramid fibres may be used to reduce the asbestos content in asbestos-only based engineering plastics...|$|R
