50|$|Picralima nitida, the akuamma, is a tree. The dried {{seeds from}} this plant {{are used in}} {{traditional}} medicine throughout West Africa, particularly in Ghana {{as well as in}} the Ivory Coast and Nigeria. The seeds are <b>crushed</b> <b>or</b> <b>powdered</b> and taken orally, and are mainly used for the treatment of malaria and diarrhoea, and as a painkiller. The plant produces the alkaloids pericine and akuammine, among others.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the discovery, it {{was well}} known that oil and oily {{substances}} had a selective affinity or attraction for, and would unite mechanically with, the minute particles of metal and metallic compounds found in <b>crushed</b> <b>or</b> <b>powdered</b> ores, but would not so unite with the quartz, or rocky non-metallic material, called gangue. It was also well known that this selective property of oils and oily substances was increased when applied to some ores {{by the addition of}} a small amount of acid to the ore and water used in process of concentration.|$|E
40|$|Cissus repanda Vahl. (Family Vitaceae), {{commonly}} known in Hindi as ‘Panivel’, {{is a large}} climber distributed all over India and also occasionally cultivated in garden. The <b>crushed</b> <b>or</b> <b>powder</b> of stem is prescribed by tribal people and vidyas of Orissa, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and some parts of Karnataka for its healing properties in case of bone fractures, cuts and wounds. Inspite of its reputation in these ailments {{it has not yet}} been investigated scientifically hence it was thought worth to study it in detail. The present paper highlights the pharmacognostical and phytochemical details and their role in laying down standardization and pharmacopoeial parameters. The fluorescence analysis of stem powder, physicochemical parameters like moisture content, total ash, acid insoluble ash, alcohol soluble extractive value and water soluble extractive values are taken. The diagnostic characters are mucilage, calcium oxalate rosette and acicular crystals, starch grains, tannin content cell, annular and scaleriform vessels and fibres. Preliminary organic analysis revealed alkaloids, tannins, calcium, and mucilage...|$|R

They are left to dry in spots with sunlight and ventilation to conserve them, allowing their use in cooking until the next harvest.

40|$|In Valencia Region (Spain), {{some wild}} and {{cultivated}} sages {{are used for}} medicinal purposes. Among them, Salvia officinalis subsp. lavandulifolia (SL) is widely employed and known for production of Spanish sage oil and herbal products. Nevertheless, it shares the market with S. blancoana subsp. mariolensis (SB) and, to a lesser extent, with their hybrid S. x hegelmaieri (SH). The knowledge on these two species is far low and confusion between them is possible. The aim of the present paper {{is to improve the}} ethnopharmacological, morphological and chemical knowledge of these sages, and to contribute to setting up quality specifications for improving identification and distinction from other Salvia species, such as, S. officinalis subsp. officinalis, S. x auriculata and S. microphylla var. microphylla. Samples were collected in Valencia Region and surrounding mountain areas during the ethnopharmacological field work. Twenty-nine medicinal uses were reported for SL, 13 of them being also recorded for SB. Of particular interest is a homemade liquor, used as digestive and known as “salvieta,” which is mainly prepared with SB. The macro- and microscopic characters are insufficient for identification of cut, <b>crushed</b> <b>or</b> <b>powdered</b> material. The study of the essential oil and a HPTLC (High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography) fingerprint of their extracts could help to distinguish SB from the other sages. The essential oil from dried aerial parts of SB (content: 1. 8 – 4. 5 %) was characterized by GC-FID (Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detector) and GC-MS (Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry) showing a composition close to that currently accepted for Spanish sage essential oil in the European Pharmacopoeia, ISO (International Standard Organization) and UNE (Una Norma Española) standards, with 1, 8 -cineole (13. 7 – 45. 7 %) and camphor (12. 1 – 28. 6 %) as major constituents. HPTLC methods, based on the analysis of hydroalcoholic and dichloromethane extracts, allowed to distinguish SB from other Salvia taxa currently found in Valencia region, except from its hybrid SH. This interdisciplinary study, that combines popular knowledge with botany and chemistry, allows to identify the raw herbal material from SB and to distinguish it from other Salvia species, ensuring a proper commercialization as herbal teas or for the preparation of spirits.
