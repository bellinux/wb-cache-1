40|$|Environmental context This study {{investigates the}} {{toxicity}} of cerium oxide nanoparticles to earthworms, key organisms in soil ecosystems.

We conclude that current soil guidelines, based simply on metal toxicity, appear to adequately protect against cerium exposure risk, at least for earthworms. Abstract The toxicity of cerium oxide (CeO 2) nanoparticles (NPs) in soils is largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the toxicity of three different CeO 2 NPs to the earthworm, Eisenia fetida, for effects on survival (at day 28) and reproduction (at day 56), as well as bioaccumulation and histopathological effects. Eisenia fetida were exposed in standard Lufa 2. 2 soil to three CeO 2 NPs of different size ranges (5 - 80 nm), one larger particle (300 nm) and a <b>cerium</b> <b>salt</b> (ammonium cerium nitrate) over an exposure range from 41 - 10000 mgCekg- 1. Survival and reproduction were not affected by the four CeO 2 particles, even at the highest exposure concentration tested. Alternatively, 10000 mgCekg- 1 <b>cerium</b> <b>salt</b> affected survival and reproduction; Median lethal concentration (LC 50) and effective concentration (EC 50) values were 317. 8 and 294. 6 mgCekg- 1. Despite a lack of toxic effect from the different forms of CeO 2 particles, there was a dose-dependent increase in cerium in the organisms at all exposure concentrations, and for all material types. Earthworms exposed to CeO 2 particles had higher concentrations of total cerium compared to those exposed to ionic cerium, but without exhibiting the same toxic effect. Histological observations in earthworms exposed to the particulate forms of CeO 2 did, however, show cuticle loss from the body wall and some loss of gut epithelium integrity. The data suggest that that CeO 2 NPs do not affect survival or reproduction in E. fetida over the standard test period. However, there were histological changes that could indicate possible deleterious effects over longer-term exposures. © CSIRO 2014...|$|E

For these purposes, cerium oxide is prepared by precipitation of insoluble <b>cerium</b> <b>salts</b> (carbonates) with a subsequent thermal decomposition. Properties of cerium oxide prepared from the carbonate precursor are strongly affected by the temperature during the calcination.

The addition of <b>cerium</b> <b>salts</b> to the aggressive media decreases the pitting susceptibility of tinplate by means of cerium precipitation on the cathodic sites (bare Sn-Fe areas). This induces to a change of the controlling mechanism suggesting that cerium is a cathodic inhibitor for tinplate, which could be corroborated by removal selectively the outer Sn layer and leaving the Sn-Fe layer directly exposed to the solution. In these conditions, the corrosion process of the steel base will take place through the defects of the Sn-Fe layer, which presents a cathodic character in comparison to the base metal, inducing the precipitation of cerium on the alloyed layer. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis revealed that the location of cerium precipitates depend on the distribution of the cathodic areas that could lead either to a continuous layer covering the surface or to precipitates inside the mechanical failures. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The morphology of the coating before corrosion tests was examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM).

Incorporation of activated CeO 2 -ZrO 2 nanoparticles reduces the cathodic and anodic current density by one order of magnitude and shifts the corrosion potential to more positive values compared with the coating containing CeO 2 -SiO 2 nanoparticles.

Oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde in 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium triflate was studied by in-situ FTIR spectroscopy and 13 C NMR spectroscopy on carbon- 13 -labeled benzyl alcohol.

Reactions of ammonium hexanitratocerate(IV) with organic substrates other than benzyl alcohol have been explored. 1, 4 -Hydroquinone is quantitatively transformed into 1, 4 -quinone. Anisole and naphthalene are nitrated. For the cerium-mediated oxidation reactions in ionic liquids, high reaction temperatures are an advantage because under these conditions smaller amounts of byproducts are formed. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The main {{drawback}} of yttria stabilized zirconia (3 Y-TZP) {{is represented}} by the Low Temperature Degradation (LTD), which consists in the progressive transformation of the tetragonal phase, metastable at room temperature, to the stable monoclinic phase, when the material is exposed to humid environment and moderate temperatures. LTD is responsible for a decrease in superficial mechanical properties for relatively short exposure times, while bulk properties are affected for longer exposures. These effects have limited the use of 3 Y-TZP in biomedical devices during the last years. A process based on the addition of ceria, a stabilizer of tetragonal phase less susceptible to LTD, has been recently developed. A solution of <b>Cerium</b> <b>salts</b> is infiltrated into the ceramic piece at the porous pre-sintered state. After sintering, ceria diffuses into zirconia lattice. In a first stage, the process was optimized in terms of LTD resistance, maintaining the microstructure, strength and hardness of 3 Y-TZP. Nevertheless, a slight decrease in indentation fracture toughness was recorded. In a second stage, the research has been focused on the possibility of compensating the toughness decrease by sintering at higher temperature, obtaining a moderate increase in grain size without prejudicial effects on the LTD resistance achieved with ceria addition.
