40|$|AbstractAimThis review {{focuses on}} {{interventions}} to prevent suicide. It excludes psychotherapy evaluations and pharmaceutical clinical trials. The {{aim of this}} article is to provide useful input to the reflection on and the development of actions for professionals who may be concerned by suicide prevention. MethodThis research is based on 41  published evaluation studies presenting results on at least one of the three following outcomes: completed suicides, suicide attempts, and suicidal ideations. These studies have been classified into seven categories of preventive action. ResultsAccording to data from the literature selected for our analysis, the three most efficient <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> seem to be the limitation of access to lethal means, the preservation of contact with the patients hospitalized for a suicide attempt after hospitalization, and the implementation of emergency call centers. The four other <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> examined in this study — the training of general practitioners, the reorganization of care, programs in schools, and information campaigns — have not yet shown sufficient proof of their efficacy. Nevertheless, these interventions, under certain conditions, can also contribute significantly to the prevention of suicide. ConclusionThe majority of effective interventions minister to people already suffering from psychological disorders, but health promotion initiatives prior to situations of psychological disorders also deserve to be considered, in particular the implementation of services for the isolated elderly...|$|E

The aim of this scoping review is to map (i) the main <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> patient-focused Internet <b>interventions</b> within fertility care, (ii) the detailed composition <b>of</b> the <b>interventions</b> and (iii) how these interventions were evaluated. METHODS: A literature search used various 'Internet' and 'Infertility' search terms to identify relevant studies published up to 1 September 2011. The selected studies had to include patients facing infertility and using an infertility-related Internet intervention. We charted data regarding <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>interventions,</b> components <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> and evaluation methodology. We categorized the stages of research using the UK's Medical Research Council framework for evaluating complex interventions. RESULTS: We included 20 studies and identified 3 educational interventions, 2 self-help interventions, 1 human-supported therapeutic intervention, 9 online support groups and 2 counselling services. Information provision, support and mental health promotion were common aims. Few interactive online components {{were present in the}} online programmes. Three studies were in the pilot phase and 17 were in the evaluation phase. CONCLUSIONS: Several <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> patient-focused Internet-based <b>interventions</b> in fertility care are primarily applied to provide support and education and promote mental health.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Primary care {{physicians}} hold a strategic position in delivering preventive services. However discrepancies exist between evidence based guidelines and practice. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> {{to improve the}} delivery of preventive services in primary care. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group specialised register (November 1995; August 1999), MEDLINE (1980 to 1995) and hand searched relevant journals. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time series analyses <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> to improve preventive services by primary care professionals responsible for patient care. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two researchers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-five studies were included, involving more than 2000 health professionals and 99, 000 people, with 83 comparisons between intervention and control groups. Post intervention differences between intervention and control groups varied widely within and across <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>interventions.</b> Most interventions {{were found to be}} effective in some studies, but not in others. Five comparisons of group education versus no intervention showed absolute change of preventive services varying between - 4 % and + 31 %. Nine comparisons of physician reminders versus no intervention showed absolute change of preventive services varying between 5 % and 24 %. Fourteen comparisons <b>of</b> multifaceted <b>interventions</b> versus no intervention showed absolute change of preventive services varying between - 3 % and + 64 %. Six comparisons <b>of</b> multifaceted <b>interventions</b> versus group education reported absolute changes varying between - 31 % and + 28 %. All these comparisons used randomised groups. Ten comparisons <b>of</b> multifaceted <b>interventions</b> versus no intervention used non-randomised groups and showed absolute change of preventive services varying between - 5 % and + 21 %. The remaining planned comparisons within <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> contained less than five comparisons. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently no solid basis for assuming that a particular <b>intervention</b> or package <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> will work. Effective interventions to increase preventive activities in primary care exist, but there is considerable variation in the level of change achieved, with effect sizes usually small or moderate. Tailoring interventions to address specific barriers to change in a particular setting is probably important. Multifaceted interventions may be more effective than single interventions, because more barriers to change can be addressed. Future research should analyse barriers to change and interventions to implement preventive services in more detail, to clarify how interventions relate to specific barriers. Since more complex interventions {{are likely to be more}} effective but also more costly, economic evaluations should also be included...|$|R

Data from 2, 723 long distance truckers were analyzed using the propensity score matching approach. Based on utilization of services, the following <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> exposure were derived: no exposure, exposure only to mid-media, exposure only to midmedia and interpersonal communication, exposure only to mid-media and project-run clinics, and exposure to all three intervention components. Compared {{to those who were}} not exposed to any intervention, exposure to mid-media alone increased consistent condom use with paid female partners by about ten percent. Exposure to mid-media and visits to project-run clinics increased consistent condom use with nonpaid female partners by 26 %. These findings suggest that mid-media events and clinics were the most effective package of services to increase consistent condom use among the long distance truckers. ...|$|E

Results Thirty systematic reviews were identified. Generally, the effects of interventions on health inequalities were unclear. However, there is suggestive systematic review evidence that certain <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> may impact positively on inequalities or on the health of specific disadvantaged groups, particularly interventions in the fields of housing and the work environment.

40|$|Many pedagogues {{have argued}} that {{learners}} should shape their own learning experience whilst tutors should facilitate this process of knowledge construction.

Net cost benefit and cost benefit ratio were the primary outcomes. <b>Categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> were also analysed. 				 				 					 						Results 					A total cost avoidance of &# 8364; 708, 221 was generated. Input costs were calculated at &# 8364; 81, 942. This resulted in a net cost benefit of &# 8364; 626, 279 and a cost benefit ratio of 8. 64 : 1. The most common type <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> was the identification of medication omissions, followed by dosage adjustments and requests to review therapies. 				 				 					 						Conclusion 					This study provides further evidence that pharmacist interventions provide substantial cost avoidance to the healthcare payer. There is a serious issue of patient&# 8217;s regular medication being omitted on transfer to an inpatient setting in Irish hospitals...|$|R
