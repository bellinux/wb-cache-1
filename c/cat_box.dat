5000|$|The Zeno effect delays {{any change}} from the initial state. The anti-Zeno effect accelerates the change. If you peek into the <b>cat</b> <b>box</b> {{frequently}} you can either delay the fateful choice or, conversely, accelerate it. Both the Zeno effect and the anti-Zeno effect are real and happen to real atoms. The quantum system being measured must be strongly coupled to the environment (in this case to the apparatus) to obtain information, but while no information is passed {{to the outside world}} it is a quasimeasurement. Then as soon as the information is passed on to the outside world, by peeking into the box, it becomes a measurement. Quasimeasurements, like measurements, cause Zeno effects. [...] So even without peeking into the box, the death of the cat would be delayed or accelerated by Zeno effects.|$|E
50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, a CCAAT box (also sometimes abbreviated a CAAT box or <b>CAT</b> <b>box)</b> is {{a distinct}} pattern of nucleotides with GGCCAATCT consensus sequence that occur upstream by 60-100 bases to the initial transcription site. The CAAT box signals the binding site for the RNA transcription factor, and is typically accompanied by a conserved consensus sequence. It is an invariant DNA sequence at about minus 70 base pairs from the origin of transcription in many eukaryotic promoters. Genes that have this element seem to require it for the gene to be transcribed in sufficient quantities. It is frequently absent from genes that encode proteins used in virtually all cells. This box along with the GC box is known for binding general transcription factors. Both of these consensus sequences belong to the regulatory promoter. Full gene expression occurs when transcription activator proteins bind to each module within the regulatory promoter. Protein specific binding {{is required for the}} CCAAT box activation. These proteins are known as CCAAT box binding proteins/CCAAT box binding factors.|$|E

40|$|Three {{kinds of}} human {{endogenous}} retrovirus-like sequences (HuERS-P 1, 2 and 3) were isolated from a HeLa cell genomic library using the 3 '-half fragment of proline tRNA as a hybridization probe. These elements contained putative primer binding sites complementary to the 3 '-terminus of proline tRNA and long terminal repeats (LTRs) characteristic of retrovirus provirus. The LTR sequence of HuERS-P 1 consisted of about 690 nucleotides and contained a <b>CAT</b> <b>box,</b> a TATA box and a polyadenylation signal. A complete unit of an Alu family sequence was {{inserted into the}} 5 '-LTR {{of one of the}} clones. HuERS-P 2 also contained a TATA box and a polyadenylation signal in its LTR (about 840 nucleotides long), but the LTR sequence of this element was quite different from that of HuERS-P 1. Although clone HuERS-P 3 contained only the 5 '-LTR region, this LTR sequence contained a <b>CAT</b> <b>box,</b> a TATA box and a poly-adenylation signal and was quite similar to the LTR sequence of the recently isolated human retrovirus-related sequence HuRRS-P (Kröger, B. and Horak, I. (1987) J. Virol., 61, 2071 - 2075). Human and simian DNAs contain 10 to 40 copies of these elements, but mouse DNA does not contain these elements...|$|E

40|$|Nucleotide {{sequences}} of a DNA fragment containing the {{long terminal repeat}} (LTR) of squirrel monkey retrovirus (SMRV) were determined. Sequence analysis showed that the SMRV LTR is 456 base pairs (bp) long and is bounded by 2 -bp inverted repeats. Within the U 3 region, there are two 43 -bp repeats and two 42 -bp repeats which are homologous to each other. These repeats are likely to provide enhancer activities commonly observed in other enhancer sequences. Following the repeats are transcriptional regulatory sequences including a <b>CAT</b> <b>box,</b> a Goldberg-Hogness box, and a polyadenylation signal, all positioned within the U 3 region of SMRV LTR.

50|$|The ALOX5 gene, which {{occupies}} 71.9 {{kilobase pairs}} (kb) on chromosome 10 (all other human lipoxygenases are clustered together on chromosome 17), {{is composed of}} 14 exons divided by 13 introns encoding the mature 78 kilodalton (kD) ALOX5 protein consisting of 673 amino acids. The gene promoter region of ALOX5 contains 8 GC boxes but lacks TATA <b>boxes</b> or <b>CAT</b> <b>boxes</b> and thus resembles the gene promoters of typical housekeeping genes. Five of the 8 GC boxes are arranged in tandem and are recognized by the transcription factors Sp1 and Egr-1. A novel Sp1-binding site occurs close to the major transcription start site (position - 65); a GC-rich core region including the Sp1/Egr-1 sites may be critical for basal 5-LO promoter activity.|$|R

40|$|The {{gene for}} the small subunit of human calcium-activated neutral {{protease}} was isolated and sequenced. It is 11 kb long and comprises 11 exons. No TATA or <b>CAT</b> <b>box</b> was found upstream of the possible transcription initiation sites, but there are three so-called G-C box sequences and one G-C box-like sequence, which are usually found in "house-keeping" genes. The first exon (exon 1) contains only the 5 '-noncoding sequence and exon 2 encodes the Gly-rich hydrophobic domain. Each of the four calcium-binding loop regions is encoded by one exon (exons 7 - 10). The intron breakpoints in the C-terminal calcium-binding domain (exons 4 - 11) completely coincide {{with those of the}} chicken large subunit gene. These findings suggest that the small and large subunits have evolved from the same ancestral calcium-binding protein and have retained the original gene organization...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} the right third of HindIII fragment L (0. 59 to 0. 65) of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) encodes a family of mRNAs some members of which appear to be related by splicing. In the experiments described in this communication, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the DNA encoding this mRNA family and precisely located the mRNAs associated with this DNA sequence. The major mRNA species is unspliced and encoded by a 2. 520 -nucleotide region. Just upstream of the 5 ' end are TATA and <b>CAT</b> <b>box</b> sequences characteristic of HSV- 1 promoters. The 3 ' end maps near a region containing a nominal polyadenylation signal. Three minor species (2, 400, 2, 200, and 1, 900 bases, respectively) appear to share a very short leader sequence with the 5 ' end of the major mRNA and are then encoded by uninterrupted DNA sequences beginning about 100, 400, and 625 bases downstream of the 5 ' end of the major unspliced mRNA. These positions map at or very near positions which agree reasonably well with consensus splice acceptor sequences. The fourth mRNA is encoded by a contiguous 730 -nucleotide sequence at the 3 ' end of the major unspliced mRNA and has its 5 ' end just downstream of recognizable TATA and <b>CAT</b> <b>box</b> sequences. We suggest that this mRNA is controlled by its own promoter. The nucleotide sequence data, {{in combination with the}} mRNA localization, demonstrate four potential polypeptides encoded by the region. The largest is 1, 569 bases long and defines a 523 -amino acid protein with sequence features characteristic of a glycoprotein. This was confirmed to be HSV- 1 glycoprotein C by immune precipitation of the in vitro translation product of the major unspliced mRNA, performed with a polyspecific antibody to HSV- 1 envelope glycoproteins (anti-env- 1 serum), and by comparison of tryptic peptides of this translation product with those of authentic HSV- 1 glycoprotein C. Polypeptides encoded by some of the minor species also were tentatively identified...|$|E
40|$|Clones {{of genes}} coding {{for two of}} the yolk protein {{precursors}} from Drosophila melanogaster, YPI and YPII have been isolated. A single small intron was located in the YPII coding region at about the same position as it is found in YPI (6). The entire intergenic spacer region and most of the exon I from the YPII gene have been sequenced. The "capping" sites for both mRNAs have been determined using the S 1 protection and cDNA synthesis methods. Comparison of the sequences which might be involved in transcriptional or translational control of these genes reveals for YPII a Hogness Goldberg box but no indication for a conserved sequence around- 70 - 80 (<b>CAT</b> <b>box).</b> In contrast to YPI it resembles no significant homology to the 3 ' end of 18 S rRNA. The first 60 amino acids of exon I from both genes share little homology except for the hydrophobic amino acids which should be involved in protein secretion...|$|E
40|$|The human Alpha {{glutathione}} S-transferase gene {{corresponding to}} the human liver cDNA clone pGTH 2 was isolated from a cosmid genome library. The gene, represented by the clone cosGTH 2, spans nearly 12 kb and contains seven exons. The intron/exon borders conform to the standard rules, and an open reading frame is present, starting at position 67 in exon 2, the double-stop codon being at position 733 in exon 7. Exons 1, 2 and 7 differ in length from the known rat gene coding for the Ya enzyme.

40|$|Sequences {{related to}} the {{squirrel}} monkey retrovirus (SMRV) LTR were isolated from a genomic library of human DNA by screening under conditions of relaxed stringency. The probe contains several transcriptional signals and its regulatory sequences in SMRV-H LTR, such as the enhancer sequence, <b>CAT</b> <b>box,</b> TATA box, and polyadenylation signal. More than 50 positive signals were detected in 4. 4 × 105 recombinant phages. The cloned human sequences named SRH strongly hybridized with SMRV-H LTR {{and some of them}} weakly hybridized with SMRV-H structural genes. In SRH- 1, the region related to SMRV-H prt-pol-env was flanked by the two separately located sequences {{related to the}} LTR. SRH- 3 has a solitary LTR-related region, whereas, in SRH- 5, the LTR-related region was adjacent to the pol-env-related sequence. The reliability of these hybridization experiments was confirmed by reciprocal hybridization.

We analysed the binding of nuclear proteins from F 9 cells to a 38 bp region that spans this site of mutation and encompasses {{two copies of}} the bovine papillomavirus core sequence, CCACCC, and characterized this do-main by mutational analysis. Our results howed that the F 441 mutation creates a sequence motif which binds TEF- 1 or a TEF-l-l ike protein from F 9 cells more strongly than its wild-type counterpart and increases its activity by about 10 -fold. Another protein identified as CP 1 binds with increased affinity {{in the presence of}} the F 441 mutation to the CAT box-like sequences which is contiguous with the downstream CCACCC box. Point mutations within these two motifs that abolished binding in vitro also impaired the activity of the F 441 locus in vivo. As neither the wild-type sequence without the F 441 mutation, nor the F 441 template without the <b>CAT</b> <b>box</b> has appreciable activity in vivo, interaction between these two elements is required for function.

40|$|Apolipoprotein A-IV (apo A-IV) {{functions}} {{in conjunction with}} other apolipoproteins to form lipoprotein particles which are involved in lipid homeostasis. In this report we present the nucleotide sequence of the mouse apo A-IV gene and demonstrate its induction in the liver by chronically high dietary lipid. The apo A-IV gene consists of three exons and two introns. The introns separate evolutionarily conserved and functional polypeptide domains. Intron 1 divides most of the apo A-IV signal peptide from the amino terminus of the mature plasma protein. The second intron separates a highly evolutionarily conserved, variant amphipathic peptide repeat from the remainder of the mature apo A-IV protein. The 5 ' flanking region has several interesting features. The apo A-IV gene has variant TATA and <b>CAT</b> <b>box</b> sequences, TTTAAA and CCAACG, respectively. There are five G-rich direct repeats of 10 nucleotides and a short inverted repeat in the 5 ' flanking region. We speculate that these sequence elements in the 5 ' flanking region may be involved in the regulation of apo A-IV gene expression. We also show that chronically high dietary lipid induces liver apo A-IV levels 10 -fold in C 57 BL/ 6 mice, a strain susceptible to atherosclerotic lesions, while we observed no induction in nonsusceptible BALB/c and C 3 H mice...|$|E
