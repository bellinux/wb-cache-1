25|$|<b>Cuppy</b> {{graduated}} from Auburn High School in 1902 {{and went on}} to the University of Chicago, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1907. As an undergraduate, he belonged to Phi Gamma Delta, acted in amateur theater and worked as campus reporter for several Chicago newspapers, notably the Record Herald and the Daily News. He lingered at Chicago seven more years as a graduate student in English literature. He did not show much interest in his studies, but in 1910 produced his first book, Maroon Tales, {{a collection of short stories}} about university life.

Cuppy's father, Thomas Jefferson <b>Cuppy</b> (1844–1912), was at different times a grain dealer, a seller of farm implements and a lumber buyer for the Eel River branch of the Wabash Railroad. His mother, Frances Stahl <b>Cuppy</b> (1855–1927), was a seamstress and worked in a small shop located next to the family home in Auburn. [...] Young <b>Cuppy</b> spent summers at a farm belonging to his grandmother, Sarah Collins <b>Cuppy</b> (1813–1900), {{on the banks of}} the Eel River near South Whitley, Indiana.

[...] <b>Cuppy's</b> Coffee & More, Inc. was a privately owned specialty coffee franchise. The firm marketed franchise opportunities {{on its website}} and describes a comprehensive, 10-day training program for its franchisees (6 days at its headquarters, 4 days onsite). The firm employed approximately 145 employees at its corporate headquarters in Fort Walton Beach, Florida before moving to Altoona, PA in September, 2008. <b>Cuppy's,</b> along with Java Jo'z national chain folded in 2009.

The literary result of Cuppy's seaside exile was How to be a Hermit, a humorous look at home economics that went through six printings in four months when it appeared in 1929. The book's subtitle, A Bachelor Keeps House, {{reflects the fact that}} <b>Cuppy</b> never married. The crew at the nearby [...] shared their food and recipes with <b>Cuppy</b> and helped him repair his shack.|$|E

[...] Later he began contributing book reviews to the New York Tribune, where his college friend Burton Rascoe (1892–1957) was literary editor.

[...] In 1926, <b>Cuppy</b> began writing a weekly [...] "Light Reading" [...] column, later renamed [...] "Mystery and Adventure", for the Tribune's successor, the New York Herald Tribune. He continued writing the column until his death 23 years later, reviewing a career total of more than 4,000 titles of crime and detective fiction.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Cuppy's</b> best-known work, a satire {{on history}} called The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody, was {{unfinished}} when he died. Its humor ranges from the remark that, when the Nile floods receded, the land, {{as far as}} the eye can see, is [...] "covered by Egyptologists", to the detailed dissection, quotation, and parody, in the chapter on Alexander the Great, of the picture of Alexander as an idealist for world peace. The book's appeal can be gauged by the fact that CBS broadcaster Edward R. Murrow and his colleague Don Hollenbeck took turns reading from it on the air [...] "until the announcer cracked up." ...|$|R
2500|$|Cuppy's cremated {{remains were}} {{returned}} to his hometown and buried in a grave next to his mother's in Evergreen Cemetery.

2500|$|In the 1930s, Stout {{turned to}} writing detective fiction. In 1933-34, he wrote Fer-de-Lance, which {{introduced}} Nero Wolfe {{and his assistant}} Archie Goodwin. The novel was published by Farrar & Rinehart in October 1934, and in abridged form as [...] "Point of Death" [...] in The American Magazine (November 1934). The characters of Wolfe and Goodwin are considered among Stout's main contributions to detective fiction. Wolfe was described by reviewer Will <b>Cuppy</b> as [...] "that Falstaff of detectives." ...|$|E
2500|$|Writing funny but factual {{magazine}} articles was Cuppy's real talent. He enjoyed a brief success in 1933 with a humorous talk show on NBC radio with actress and gourmet cook Jeanne Owen, but he flopped on the lecture circuit. Basically shy, <b>Cuppy</b> was happiest {{when he was}} rummaging through scholarly journals prizing out facts to copy out on his note cards. According to Feldkamp, one of Cuppy's favorite places was the Bronx Zoo, [...] "where he felt really relaxed." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Persian {{translation}} by Najaf Daryabandari of Cuppy's The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody {{was published}} in 1972 under the title of Čenin konand bozorgān (چنین کنند بزرگان, Thus Act the Great). [...] The good quality of the Persian prose {{and the fact of}} Cuppy's being unknown in Iran led to speculation that the book was not a translation, but an original book by Daryabandari and possibly a collaborator, who was speculated to be Ahmad Shamlou. It was guessed that this had been done in order to bypass the Pahlavi era censor. Daryabandari denied it several times, even after the Iranian Revolution. The issue was not publicly settled until the satire magazine Golagha ran an article about their [...] "discovery" [...] of <b>Cuppy,</b> which proved Daryabandari right.|$|E
60|$|He {{started to}} address his ball, {{and there was}} a weak {{uncertainty}} in the way he did it that prepared me for what was to come. His club rose, wavered, fell; and the ball, badly topped, trickled two feet and sank into a <b>cuppy</b> lie.|$|E
60|$|He was not depressed--only {{a little}} thoughtful. His {{faith in his}} luck {{sustained}} him. He was, he realized, {{in the position of}} a man who has made a supreme drive from the tee, and finds his ball near the green but in a <b>cuppy</b> lie. He had gained much; it now remained for him to push his success to the happy conclusion. The driver of Luck must be replaced by the spoon--or, possibly, the niblick--of Ingenuity. To fail now, to allow this girl to pass out of his life merely because he did not know who she was or where she was, would stamp him a feeble adventurer. A fellow could not expect Luck to do everything for him. He must supplement its assistance with his own efforts.|$|E
60|$|Their {{friendship}} ripened rapidly, as friendships {{do in the}} South of France. In that favoured clime, {{you find}} the girl and Nature does the rest. On the second morning of their acquaintance Mortimer invited her to walk round the links with him and watch him play. He did it a little diffidently, for his golf was not of the calibre that {{would be likely to}} extort admiration from a champion. On the other hand, one should never let slip the opportunity of acquiring wrinkles on the game, and he thought that Miss Somerset, if she watched one or two of his shots, might tell him just what he ought to do. And sure enough, the opening arrived on the fourth hole, where Mortimer, after a drive which surprised even himself, found his ball in a nasty <b>cuppy</b> lie.|$|E
60|$|Mitchell Holmes {{had only}} one fault. He lost his temper when playing golf. He seldom played a round without {{becoming}} piqued, peeved, or--in many cases--chagrined. The caddies on our links, it was said, could always worst other small boys in verbal argument by calling them {{some of the things}} they had heard Mitchell call his ball on discovering it in a <b>cuppy</b> lie. He had a great gift of language, and he used it unsparingly. I will admit that there was some excuse for the man. He had the makings of a brilliant golfer, but a combination of bad luck and inconsistent play invariably robbed him of the fruits of his skill. He was the sort of player who does the first two holes in one under bogey and then takes an eleven at the third. The least thing upset him on the links. He missed short putts because of the uproar of the butterflies in the adjoining meadows.|$|E
