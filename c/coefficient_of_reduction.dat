40|$|The {{emergence}} of intensively managed olive plantations in arid, northwestern Argentina requires the {{efficient use of}} irrigation water. We evaluated whole tree daily transpiration and soil evaporation throughout the year {{to better understand the}} relative importance of these water use components and to calculate actual crop coefficient (Kc) values. Plots in a 7 -year-old 'Manzanilla fina' olive grove with 23 % canopy cover were either moderately (MI) or highly irrigated (HI) using the FAO method where potential evapotranspiration over grass is multiplied by a given Kc and a <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>reduction</b> (Kr). The Kc values employed for the MI and HI treatments were 0. 5 and 1. 1, respectively, and the Kr was 0. 46. Transpiration was estimated by measuring main trunk sap flow using the heat balance method for three trees per treatment. Soil evaporation was measured using six microlysimeters in one plot per treatment. Both parameters were evaluated for 7 - 10 consecutive days in the fall, winter, mid-spring, summer, and early fall of 2006 - 2007. Maximum soil evaporation was observed in the summer when maximum demand was combined with maximum surface wetted by the drips and evaporation from the inter-row occurred due to rainfall. Similarly, maximum daily transpiration was observed in mid-spring and summer. Transpiration of MI trees was 30 % lower than in HI trees during the summer period. However, this difference in transpiration disappeared when values were adjusted for total leaf area per tree because leaf area was 28 % less in the MI trees. Transpiration represented about 70 - 80 % of total crop evapotranspiration (ETc) except when soil evaporation increased due to rainfall events or over-irrigation occurred. We found that daily transpiration per unit leaf area had a positive linear relationship with daily potential evapotranspiration (r 2 = 0. 84) when considering both treatments together. But, a strong relationship was also observed between transpiration per unit leaf area and mean air temperature (r 2 = 0. 93). Thus, it is possible to predict optimum irrigation requirements for olive groves if tree leaf area and temperature are known. Calculated crop coefficients during the growing season based on the transpiration and soil evaporation values were about 0. 65 - 0. 70 and 0. 85 - 0. 90 for the MI and HI treatments, respectively.

40|$|One of {{peculiarities of}} {{stiffened}} panels (SP) design for aircraft composite wing with minimum weight is {{the necessity of}} taking into account possibility of different buckling failures with ultimate loads. Besides while designing SP {{it is necessary to}} take into account various modes of composite material failure including those originating from transverse shear stress influence. Composite SP design methods developed on the basis of equistability principal are offered in this work. Different variants of loading (including combined shear and compression loading) are taking into account. Analytical dependences of SP thickness vs load allowing to estimate different design concepts examined at an early stage of design and to compare different types of SP are obtained. Researches of SP element optimal reinforcement in case of stability strict restrictions have been performed on the basis of developed methods. Recommendations on several types of SP optimal reinforcement are given. Research results complement conclusions to which task of optimal reinforcement with static strength strict restrictions draw.

This article presents theory of a full model of tetrasomic linkage and develops a statistical framework for the linkage analysis. The model considers both double reduction and recombination, the most essential features of tetrasomic inheritance with linked loci, whereas the statistical method takes appropriate account of the major complexities in analyzing both dominant and codominant molecular marker data during map reconstruction in tetraploid species. These complexities include the problems arising from multiple dosage of allelic inheritance, the null allele, allelic segregation distortion, mixed bivalent and quadrivalent pairing in meiosis, and incomplete information of marker phenotype data.

For a subcritical Reynolds number of 3000, a maximum drag <b>coefficient</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> up to 18 % compared with a circular cylinder is obtained corresponding to an optimal wavelength ratio of λ/Dm around 1. 9 and an amplitude ratio a/Dm of 0. 152. The fluctuating lift <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> the wavy cylinders are also greatly reduced or even suppressed. These kinds of wavy surfaces lead to the formation of three-dimensional free shear layers which are more stable than purely two-dimensional free shear layers. Such free shear layers will only roll up into mature vortices at further downstream positions. This significantly modified the near wake structures and the pressure distribution around the cylinder. It was found that the wave amplitude to wavelength ratio a/λ plays an essential role in determining the 3 D vortex structure behind the wavy cylinders which has a significant effect on the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the fluctuating lift and suppression of flow-induced vibration.

40|$|A convexly curved and isothermally heated {{wall with}} a 45 -cm radius of {{curvature}} is subjected to turbulent boundary layer flow measurements {{in order to determine}} wall heat transfer rates and mean velocity and temperature profiles. Significant curvature effects are noted, with Stanton number and skin friction <b>coefficient</b> <b>reductions</b> <b>of</b> 35 - 40 percent by comparison with flat plate values for the same momentum or enthalpy thickness Reynolds numbers. Profiles of mean velocity and temperature show a more rapid growth of the wake regions, and a shortening of the log-linear region, as a result of curvature. Turbulent Prandtl numbers deduced from the mean temperature profiles under the assumption of a wall thermal law were found to be increased by 40 - 50 percent by this strong convex curvature...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{configurations}} of aircraft {{deal with a}} high performance design of lifting systems especially oriented to <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> weight, aerodynamic drag and fuel consumption. The paper shows preliminary results of aerodynamic and structural analyses of a high aspect ratio wing with curved planform, carried out at the Department of Aerospace Engineering of the University of Pisa. In transonic flight condition (high subsonic), for curved planform wing, the wave drag effects are significantly reduced. A numerical comparison, carried out using the FLUENT® code, between curved and traditional swept wing, both designed with the same supercritical airfoil, shows a drag <b>coefficient</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> 4 % and more for asymptotic Mach numbers greater than 0. 85. The B 787 aircraft’s wing planform has been assumed as reference geometry {{to carry out the}} numerical analyses. The curved planform configuration also improves the aeroelastic behaviour of the wing: some preliminary results obtained using the NASTRAN® code are summarized in the paper...|$|R
