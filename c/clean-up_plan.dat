50|$|Greg Lindquist {{was born}} in Wilmington, North Carolina, {{graduated}} from Emsley A. Laney High School in 1997, studied art and English at North Carolina State University and attended graduate school in New York at Pratt Institute, earning a MFA in painting and masters in art history. During graduate school, Lindquist was a research intern at the Museum of Modern Art, writing wall labels for the permanent collection. He also worked as an assistant for the artist Ryan McGinness. Lindquist's early work addressed landscape as a memorial, confronting the gentrification of the deindustrialized Brooklyn waterfronts of Williamsburg and Red Hook in late capitalism. Addressing the entropic forces in architecture, he traveled to Tbilisi, Georgia to research decay from the Soviet Union era. The Dan River coal ash spill in 2014 ll has been the conceptual, visual, thematic, and political driver of his Smoke and Water project. Working in partnership with Working Films, he created an installation of paintings and murals from an image shared by a water keeper documenting ash swirling with river water. The work was completed collaboratively with the local art, ecology, and activist communities. Lindquist works with the guiding principle that art can facilitate social change, actively creating space {{for the possibility of}} mobilizing political action and reshaping common values. In 2015, he was Guest Critic for the November issue of The Brooklyn Rail and curated a concurrent show, Social Ecologies which focused on the intersections and ruptures between art and ecology. Returning to NYC as a site of research, Lindquist has continued his engagement with community-centered, ecologically driven interventions through research on the Newtown Creek, a critically polluted waterway on the Brooklyn and Queens border. Working with the Newtown Creek Alliance, he has assisted with water quality collection and has reviewed EPA <b>clean-up</b> <b>plans</b> while serving on a technical data committee. He also co-organized an ongoing series of collaborative research events on a human-powered rowboat in the Newtown Creek’s autonomous zone with up-close, site specific fieldwork and painting.|$|R

The objectives of this plan are to: Group housekeeping FFACO CASS and non-FFACO housekeeping sites into sectors and remediate during the same field visit; Provide consistent documentation on FFACO CAS and non-FFACO clean-up activities; Perform similar activities under one approved document; Remediate areas inside the Deactivation and Decommissioning facilities and compounds in a campaign-style remediation; and Increase efficiencies and cost-effectiveness, accelerate cleanups, reduce mobilization, demobilization, and remediation costs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMachining {{quality of}} {{clean-up}} region {{has a strong}} influence on the performances of the impeller. In order to <b>plan</b> <b>clean-up</b> tool paths rapidly and obtain good finish surface quality, an efficient and robust tool path generation method is presented, which employs an approach based on point-searching. The clean-up machining mentioned in this paper is pencil-cut and multilayer fillet-cut for a free-form model with a ball-end cutter. For pencil-cut, the cutter center position can be determined via judging whether it satisfies the distance requirement. After the searching direction and the tracing direction have been determined, by employing the point-searching algorithm {{with the idea of}} dichotomy, all the cutter contact (CC) points and cutter location (CL) points can be found and the clean-up boundaries can also be defined rapidly. Then the tool path is generated. Based on the main concept of pencil-cut, a multilayer fillet-cut method is proposed, which utilizes a ball-end cutter with its radius less than the design radius of clean-up region. Using a sequence of intermediate virtual cutters to divide the clean-up region into several layers and given a cusp-height tolerance for the final layer, then the tool paths for all layers are calculated. Finally, computer implementation is also presented in this paper, and the result shows that the proposed method is feasible...|$|R
50|$|After {{the closure}} of the mine and the {{abandonment}} of Gilman, a 235 acre area, which included 8 million tons of mine waste, were designated a Superfund site by the EPA and placed on the National Priorities List in 1986.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{potential}} impacts of future climate and socio-economic {{change on the}} flow and nitrogen fluxes of the Ganga river system. This is the first basin scale water quality study for the Ganga considering climate change at 25 km resolution together with socio-economic scenarios. The revised dynamic, process-based INCA model was used to simulate hydrology and water quality within the complex multi-branched river basins. All climate realizations utilized in the study predict increases in temperature and rainfall by the 2050 s with significant increase by the 2090 s. These changes generate associated increases in monsoon flows and increased availability of water for groundwater recharge and irrigation, but also more frequent flooding. Decreased concentrations of nitrate and ammonia are expected due to increased dilution. Different future socio-economic scenarios {{were found to have}} a significant impact on water quality at the downstream end of the Ganga. A less sustainable future resulted in a deterioration of water quality due to the pressures from higher population growth, land use change, increased sewage treatment discharges, enhanced atmospheric nitrogen deposition, and water abstraction.

40|$|Monitored natural {{attenuation}} (MNA) {{makes use of}} biological degradation, chemical reactions with natural materials, and other processes to clean up contaminated soils and groundwater. In the past, the regulatory community {{has been slow to}} accept {{natural attenuation}} due to a misperception that natural attenuation is a “do nothing ” approach. Recently however, regulators have been more open to considering MNA as part of an overall <b>clean-up</b> <b>plan</b> that includes active treatment technologies to remove or contain the source of contamination at a site. MNA is currently being implemented at the Savannah River Site for remediation of selected contaminants. The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, who has regulatory authority over these actions, has accepted this process. Significant overall cost savings are forecast. Additionally, there will be less disruption to the ecosystem, compared with engineered technologies. This paper describes the monitored natural attenuation concept as well as the process of constructive engagement with the regulators to achieve acceptance.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{research done}} on the automatic preparation of remediation plans and navigation data for the precise guidance of heavy machinery in clean-up work after an industrial disaster. The input test data consists of a pollution extent shapefile derived from the processing of hyperspectral aerial survey data from the Kolontár red mud disaster. Three algorithms were developed and the respective scripts were written in Python. The first model aims at drawing a parcel <b>clean-up</b> <b>plan.</b> The model tests four different parcel orientations (0, 90, 45 and 135 degree) and keeps the plan where clean-up parcels are less numerous considering it is an optimal spatial configuration. The second model drifts the clean-up parcel of a work plan both vertically and horizontally following a grid pattern with sampling distance of a fifth of a parcel width and keep the most optimal drifted version; here also with the belief to reduce the final number of parcel features. The last model aims at drawing a navigation line {{in the middle of}} each clean-up parcel. The models work efficiently and achieve automatic optimized plan generation (parcels and navigation lines). Applying the first model we demonstrated that depending on the size and geometry of the features of the contaminated area layer, the number of clean-up parcels generated by the model varies in a range of 4 % to 38 % from plan to plan. Such a significant variation with the resulting feature numbers shows that the optimal orientation identification can result in saving work, time and money in remediation. The various tests demonstrated that the model gains efficiency when 1 / the individual features of contaminated area present a significant orientation with their geometry (features are long), 2 / the size of pollution extent features becomes closer {{to the size of the}} parcels (scale effect). The second model shows only 1 % difference with the variation of feature number; so this last is less interesting for planning optimization applications. Last model rather simply fulfils the task it was designed for by drawing navigation lines...|$|E
