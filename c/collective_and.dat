40|$|Collective Autonomy in the European Union’ {{explores the}} {{question}} of collective autonomy by investigating the relationship between <b>collective</b> bargaining <b>and</b> legal regulation and its current evolution in the national contexts and in the EU internal market. The thesis aims at achieving a comprehensive understanding of the notion, function <b>and</b> exercise of <b>collective</b> autonomy <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining, <b>and</b> it argues that <b>collective</b> autonomy <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining in contemporary Europe present challenges that alter their basic features. To this end, the thesis undertakes a multifaceted analysis integrating three perspectives: a theoretical perspective analysing and combining the conceptual elements of <b>collective</b> autonomy <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining as defined in industrial relations theories, labour law theories, and in the discourses on global labour rights; a comparative perspective analysing how <b>collective</b> autonomy <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining have found legal regulation in the Italian and Swedish labour law and industrial relations contexts; a cross-border perspective examining how the EU regulation of the internal market freedoms of establishment and to provide services impacts on the features of <b>collective</b> autonomy <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining. By combining elements of international, European and comparative labour law, EU internal market law, and industrial relations, this thesis explores the unique features of <b>collective</b> autonomy <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining as socio-economic mechanisms having a normative power, whose functioning is however influenced by legal dynamics. Eventually, it examines the transformation that the foundations of <b>collective</b> autonomy <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining undergo {{in relation to the}} challenges deriving from both the processes of company-level decentralisation and the dynamics of the cross-border scenarios in the EU internal market. Ultimately, the thesis contributes to advancing the understanding of the foundations of <b>collective</b> autonomy <b>and</b> to exploring its operations beyond national borders...|$|R

5|$|To {{ensure the}} mission to steal a Zero Point Module is a success, Dr. McKay (David Hewlett) proposes to use Dr. Weir (Torri Higginson) and her nanites to access the Asuran <b>collective</b> <b>and</b> guide them; should the Asurans take her over, McKay would {{activate}} a kill switch on the nanites, which would also effectively kill Weir. With their experimental jumper ready, Sheppard (Joe Flanigan) leaves Teyla (Rachel Luttrell) in command of Atlantis. The jumper's hyperdrive works and they arrive over the Asuran homeworld (M7R-227). With Weir's access, Sheppard and Ronon (Jason Momoa) easily steal the Zero Point Module. McKay then finds a code that will cause the Asurans to attack the Wraith and convinces Sheppard to upload a programme to reactivate this dormant code.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s the Elephant 6 collective, {{including}} {{acts like}} The Apples in Stereo, The Olivia Tremor Control, Neutral Milk Hotel, Elf Power and of Montreal, produced eclectic psychedelic rock and folk. Other alternative acts to pursue psychedelia from the 1990s included The Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Dandy Warhols, Kula Shaker and Super Furry Animals. Stoner rock also emerged, combining elements of psychedelic rock, blues-rock and doom metal. Typically using a slow-to-mid tempo and featuring low-tuned guitars in a bass-heavy sound, with melodic vocals, and 'retro' production, it was pioneered by the Californian bands Kyuss and Sleep. In the UK the Madchester scene influenced the early sound of 1990s Britpop bands like Blur. The Verve mixed on 1960s psychedelia with the shoegazing aesthetic. Oasis also drew on 1960s psychedelic pop and rock. In the immediate post-Britpop era Kula Shaker incorporated swirling, guitar-heavy sounds of late-'60s psychedelia with Indian mysticism and spirituality. In {{the new millennium}} neo-psychedelia was continued by bands directly emulating {{the sounds of the}} 60s such as The Black Angels, Tame Impala, Pond, King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard, Unknown Mortal Orchestra and The Essex Green, while bands like Animal <b>Collective</b> <b>and</b> The Bright Light Social Hour applied an experimental approach that combined genres from the 1960s and the present.M.

5|$|Literary critic Todd Garth {{argues that}} I, the Supreme is {{influenced}} by twentieth-century Argentine writer Macedonio Fernández, {{as well as other}} avant garde artists such as Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cortázar. Garth suggests that Macedonio and Roa Bastos are similar in use of metaphysical language and techniques used to reconstruct reality, as Dr. Francia does in his dictated creation of the Supreme, the ruler of all reality. Macedonio's writing utilized characters that did not fit the archetype of Western fiction, each only having meaning through their interaction with others in a <b>collective</b> <b>and</b> often never experiencing growth or development in order to construct atemporal spaces of mythmaking that challenge reality. Roa Bastos borrows from these ideas yet situates them in existing political and social history to challenge perceived conceptions of the past's factuality. He dismantles national Paraguayan mythology which is so intimately intertwined with the life of Dr. Francia, elucidating the distinctions between mythic and mythological. The novel can only accomplish this task within the metaphysical space of mythmaking. Whereas Macedonio attacks the concept of the individual as subject while admitting the fact that to write makes oneself a subject, Roa Bastos recognizes this paradox and exploits it, utilizing it in concerns of political and social nature.|$|E

40|$|This article {{inquires}} {{into the}} social function of guilt, especially <b>collective</b> guilt, <b>and</b> the implications thereof for <b>collective</b> violence <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> memory. The {{focus is on the}} relationship between <b>collective</b> violence <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> memory in countries that have experienced cultural trauma, defined as a dramatic loss of identity and meaning, a tear in the social fabric. Analyzing the dynamics—the mechanisms and processes—of remembering and forgetting such trauma, I argue that the idea of collective guilt is essential for making sense of <b>collective</b> violence <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> memory. Specifically, I show that collective violence requires collective action; that collective action produces collective guilt; that collective violence generates perceptions—and misperceptions—of <b>collective</b> guilt; <b>and</b> that <b>collective</b> memory is formed, deformed, and transformed by perceptions—and misperceptions—of collective guilt. The article uses illustrative data from a variety of cases to illuminate these dynamics. It concludes by explaining why understanding these dynamics is imperative for responding to historic injustice in the twenty-first century...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} theories of collectivity or social grouphood presupposed by accounts of collective intentionality, <b>collective</b> action <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> moral responsibility. I consider the intentionalist theories of social grouphood proposed by John Searle and Margaret Gilbert, Larry May’s conceptual account of social grouphood, and Paul Sheehy’s realist conception of social grouphoood. All three approaches {{are found to be}} problematic. The theories of Searle and Gilbert fail to adequately explain the causal relationship between <b>collectives</b> <b>and</b> their members, the heterogeneity of social groups and non-voluntary social groups; May’s theory is problematic insofar as it relies on sameness among individual group members; and, as a consequence of his failure to recognize that the causal powers of a social group are mediated by, and thereby depend upon, the perspectives of individuals, Sheehy’s account is unable to explain non-voluntary social groups. A conception of social grouphood that is able to avoid these shortcomings is identified. However, it raises doubts about the possibility of collective agency, something that theories of <b>collective</b> action <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> moral responsibility tend to assume. Consequently, I explore whether <b>collective</b> action <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> moral responsibility require collective agency. Theories of <b>collective</b> action <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> moral responsibility that do not require collective agency have been proposed. These proposals conceive of <b>collective</b> action <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> moral responsibility as joint action and joint moral responsibility, respectively. I recommend a dialogical account of joint action that is consistent with the notion that only individuals can be agents and supports ascriptions of joint moral responsibility...|$|R
