40|$|Background: One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems in radiotherapy (RT) with χ and γ-rays is hypoxic cells, in the centre of solids tumours. Due to insufficient blood perfusion, these cells are more resistant to RT. The purpose of the study is to assess the effect of heating cells on <b>chromosomal</b> <b>damages</b> induced by an extremely low dose of neutron or γ irradiation, in human lymphocytes. Method: Human blood samples were exposed to hyperthermia (HT), 6 cGy neutron (or γ-rays), HT+neutron/γ, and neutron/γ+HT. HT was applied at 41. 5 °C for 30 and 60 min as well as 43 °C for 15 and 30 min. The time interval between the two treatments was 1 hr. After cell culture, harvesting, fixation, and staining, the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>damages</b> were scored in metaphase stage and statistical analyses were performed. Results: In comparison to the control groups, HT alone at 41. 5 °C (neither for 30 nor 60 min) did not induce significantly higher <b>chromosomal</b> <b>damages</b> (p= 0. 8); however, the number of damages was significantly higher at 43 °C for 30 min (p< 0. 05). Furthermore, compared to the control groups the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>damages</b> was significantly different when cells irradiated with neutron/γ-rays (p< 0. 05).

Comparing neutron and γ irradiation, the number of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>damages</b> was remarkably higher when cells irradiated with neutron (p< 0. 01). Conclusion: Since applying an extremely low dose of neutron plus HT caused more <b>chromosomal</b> <b>damages,</b> in comparison to neutron/γ alone, or HT plus neutron/γ; and because cell death {{is directly related to the}} chromosomal damage; thus, this combined regime might be considered as a treatment modality in cancer treatment...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} hyperthermia (HT) on the frequency of chromosomal aberrations induced by a low dose of neutron or Y-rays in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Materials and Methods: Blood samples were exposed to HT (41. 5 degrees C for 30 and 60 min, 43 degrees C for 15 and 30 min), 10 cGy neutron or Y-rays, HT + neutron/Y, and neutron/Y + HT. After standard cell culture, harvesting, fixation and staining, the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>damages</b> were scored in metaphase plates. Results: HT alone at 41. 5 degrees C did not induce chromatid or chromosome aberrations, however, the frequency of damages was significantly higher at 43 C (P< 0. 05). Furthermore, the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>damages</b> was significantly different when cells were irradiated with neutron or Y-rays alone (P< 0. 01). HT 1 hr post neutron/Y irradiation significantly induced higher chromosome damages in comparison to HT 1 hr before irradiation (P< 0. 05). The <b>chromosomal</b> <b>damages</b> were remarkably higher when cells were irradiated with neutron then heated at 43 C for 30 min. Conclusion: Since increasing frequency of chromosome damages increases probability of cell death, application of HT after neutron irradiation (instead of X- or gamma- rays) might {{be considered as a}} procedure for cells killing in radiotherapy.

The abnormal cell divisions, in turn, lead to chromosomal mal-segregation and aneuploidy. In this study, the effects of the stress hormone, hydrocortisone (HYD), were investigated on the induced chromosomal abnormalities by vinblastine (VIN) during cell cycle in L 929 cells. Methods: This work was performed in winter 2013 at Department of Biology, University of Ferdowsi, Mashhad, Iran. Cultured cells were divided into different groups including control, VIN-treated, HYD treated and VIN+HYD co-treated cells.

Research has indicated that o-toluidine is a mutagen and causes oxidative DNA damage and <b>chromosomal</b> <b>damage</b> (Skipper et al. 2010). Multiple {{studies have shown that the}} compound induces oxidative DNA damage and strand breaks in cultured human cells (Watanabe et al. 2010; Ohkuma et al. 1999, Watanabe et al. 2010).

Organisms were transplanted for 4 weeks in different locations of the river basin and the bioaccumulation of metals was integrated with a wide battery of biomarkers consisting of oxidative, genotoxic and lysosomal responses. Such parameters included the levels of individual antioxidants (catalase, glutathione-S-transferases, glutathione reductase, Se-dependent and Se-independent glutathione peroxidases, total glutathione), the total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC), metallothionein-like proteins, the assessment of DNA integrity, <b>chromosomal</b> <b>damages</b> and lysosomal membrane stability. Elevated levels of several metals were measured in sediments, but the relatively low tissue concentrations suggested a moderate bioaccumulation, possibly due to a high excretion efficiency, of U. pictorum and/or to a limited bioavailability of these elements, partly deriving from erosion of bedrocks. Among antioxidant responses, those based on glutathione metabolism and the activity of catalase were mostly affected in bivalves showing a significant accumulation of arsenic, mercury and/or nickel. In these specimens, the content of glutathione and the activities of glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidases (H 2 O 2) were respectively 9 -, 6 - and 4 -fold lower than in controls, while a 3 -fold increase was observed for catalase. Despite some differences in the response of individual antioxidants, a significant reduction of the capability to neutralize peroxyl radicals was observed in bivalves caged in all the impacted sites of the river basin; these organisms also exhibited a significant impairment at the DNA, chromosomal and lysosomal levels.

The major susceptibility gene, the Apolipoprotein (APOE) ε 4 allele is associated with a 4 -fold increased risk for AD if one ε 4 allele is present and can advance the age-of-onset of AD by 7 - 9 years. Carriers of the ε 4 allele are also associated with poorer cognitive performance, increased amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle burden and greater levels of neuronal cell death. Previous studies have demonstrated that AD individuals possess elevated levels of genomic instability and an altered lipid and nutritional profile. At present the mechanism by which APOE ε 4 may accelerate the onset of AD is unknown but may include genomic instability in AD individuals via promoting the intracellular accumulation of the neurotoxic amyloid beta 42 peptide (Aβ₄₂) or directly altering the homeostasis of important lipids such as Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and cholesterol, which are crucial for optimal brain function. To date, there is limited information regarding the genomic instability profile of APOE ε 4 carriers and their nutritional status. The primary aims of the thesis were to investigate the following hypothesis: (i) APOE ε 4 carriers without cognitive impairment have greater levels of <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>damage</b> and cell death as measured in human peripheral lymphocytes compared to non-ε 4 carriers. (ii) APOE ε 4 carriers without cognitive impairment have an altered lipid and nutritional profile compared to non-ε 4 carriers. The thesis comprised of two distinct studies: (i) An in vitro study which investigated whether long term supplementation of two fatty acids present in fish oil, i. e. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Furan Fatty Acids (FFA) can prevent oxidative stress-induced cell death and DNA damage in an astrocytoma cell lines with or without the APOE ε 4 allele. (ii) An in vivo study investigating the primary hypothesis that APOE ε 4 carriers that were not cognitively impaired exhibit greater levels of <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>damage</b> and an altered lipid and nutritional profile compared to non-ε 4 carriers. The Cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-Cyt) assay was the primary genome instability assay used in both studies, as it is a comprehensive technique that allows <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>damage</b> to be measured visually in once divided cells that are recognised by their binucleate appearance. Examples of <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>damage</b> scored include micronuclei (MNi, chromosome breakage and/or loss), nuclear buds (NBUDs, DNA amplification and or removal of DNA repair complexes) and nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs, DNA misrepair and/or telomere end fusions). Previous studies have demonstrated that DHA promotes antioxidant defences in the brain, while FFA is emerging as a potential antioxidant and believed to contribute to the benefits of fish oil. The cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of DHA and FFA was investigated in in vitro cultures of U 87 MG (APOE ɛ 3 /ɛ 3) and U 118 MG (APOE ɛ 2 /ɛ 4) astrocytoma cell lines with and without a hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂, 100 μM) challenge. The APOE ε 4 cell line was found to be more sensitive to the cytostatic (P < 0. 001), cytotoxic (i. e., apoptosis, P < 0. 001) and DNA damaging effects (i. e. MNi, P < 0. 001; NPBs, P < 0. 001 and NBUDs, P < 0. 01) of H₂O₂ when compared to the non-ε 4 cell line. DHA at 100 μg/mL significantly affected cytostasis (P < 0. 05) and increased DNA damage in the form of NPBs and MNi (P < 0. 05) in both cell lines, whereas it decreased necrosis (P = 0. 0251) in the non-ε 4 cell line. FFA had no effect on <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>damage</b> in both cell lines investigated. Findings from the in vivo study suggest that APOE ε 4 carriers do not experience significantly different rates of cytostasis, cytotoxicity and/or <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>damage</b> (MNi, NPBs and NBUDs) as measured by the CBMNCyt assay, when compared to non-APOE ε 4 carriers after correcting for age and gender. However, there was a trend for increased NPBs and NBUDs in homozygous ε 4 carriers compared to non-carriers. Analysis of plasma nutrients and lipids showed no significant differences between ε 4 and non-ε 4 carriers with the exception of Phosphorus (P = 0. 042), total plasma cholesterol (P < 0. 0001) and LDL-cholesterol (P < 0. 0001) which were higher in APOE ε 4 carriers. This study was the first to characterise the CBMN-Cyt assay <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>damage</b> profile of APOE ε 4 carriers. Although no statistically significant differences for any of the cytome biomarkers in our cohort was reported, the limited trend for increased NPBs (r = 0. 118, P = 0. 06) suggests the possibility of the loss of systemic genome integrity as measured in surrogate tissues such as lymphocytes but may not adequately explain why APOE ε 4 carriers are at higher risk of developing AD. The results of this study are not generalisable to other cohorts with poor lifestyle habits or to non-healthy or older APOE ε 4 carriers in which the effects of APOE ε 4 may be more evident (i. e. smokers and obese individuals). In addition, whilst there were no substantial differences in <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>damage</b> biomarkers in the form of MNi, NPBs and/or NBUDs in peripheral lymphocytes, DNA damage studies using a large cohort to increase statistical power and other biomarkers such as the buccal micronucleus cytome assay, telomere length and integrity, comet assay and γH 2 AX would allow a more complete characterisation of the DNA damage profile of APOE ε 4 carriers and a more definitive assessment of the role of DNA damage in APOE ε 4 -related pathology.
