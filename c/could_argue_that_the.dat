25|$|No one <b>could</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Australian team wasn't in {{the middle}} of a slump. In the 11 Tests prior to the 1989 Ashes series the Australians had {{recorded}} a disappointing 2 wins, 4 losses and 5 draws. From this poor form, Australia turned around to produce one of the most one-sided Ashes series since the 'Invincibles' of the 1948 Ashes series.|$|E
25|$|Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote:...you have {{to wonder}} who, exactly, wants or perhaps needs to see another movie about the Holocaust that embalms its horrors with artfully spilled tears and asks us to pity a death-camp guard. You <b>could</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film isn’t really about the Holocaust, but about the {{generation}} that grew up in its shadow, {{which is what the}} book insists. But the film is neither about the Holocaust nor about those Germans who grappled with its legacy: it's about making the audience feel good about a historical catastrophe that grows fainter with each new tasteful interpolation.|$|E
25|$|Because of the unorthodox {{nature of}} hand and body position, {{it is often}} {{difficult}} to get a lot of power behind a reverse sweep; in many situations, the intention is to glance or cut the ball to the backward leg area. However, in rare occasions, players have been able to execute reverse sweeps for a six. Kevin Pietersen, who pioneered switch hitting, is adept at this, but one <b>could</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> resulting shot is basically a sweep rather than a reverse sweep. A more classic example of such a shot would be Yusuf Pathan's six off Robin Peterson. South Africa's AB de Villiers is well known for his ability to hit sixes with the reverse sweep at ease and Glenn Maxwell also often plays reverse sweep.|$|E

25|$|The Church of Sweden was instigated by King Gustav I (1523–60) {{and within}} the half century {{following}} his death had become established as a Lutheran state church with significant power in Swedish society, itself {{under the control of}} the state apparatus. A degree of freedom of worship (for foreign residents only) was achieved under the rule of Gustav III (1771–92), but it was not until the passage of the Dissenter Acts of 1860 and 1874 that Swedish citizens were allowed to leave the state church – and then only provided that those wishing to do so first registered their adhesion to another, officially approved denomination. Following years of discussions that began in 1995, the Church of Sweden was finally separated from the state as from 1 January 2000. However, the separation was not fully completed. Although the status of state religion came to an end, the Church of Sweden nevertheless remains Swedens national church, and as such is still regulated by the government through the law of the Church of Sweden. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to refer to a change of relation between state and church rather than a separation. Furthermore, the Swedish constitution still maintain that the Sovereign and the members of the royal family has to confess an evangelical Lutheran faith, which in praxis means they need to be members of the Church of Sweden to remain in the line of succession. Thusly according to the ideas of cuius regio, eius religio one <b>could</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> symbolic connection between state and church still remains.|$|E
500|$|John Norris of MTV News {{has stated}} that the remix was [...] "responsible for, I would argue, an entire wave of music that we've seen since {{and that is the}} R collaboration. You <b>could</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 'Fantasy' remix was the single most {{important}} recording that she's ever made." [...] Norris echoed the sentiments of TLC's Lisa Lopes, who told MTV that it's because of Mariah that we have [...] "Hip-Pop." [...] Judnick Mayard, writer of TheFader, wrote that in regarding of R and hip hop collaboration, [...] "The champion of this movement is Mariah Carey." [...] Mayard also expressed that [...] "To this day ODB and Mariah may still be the best and most random hip hop collaboration of all time", citing that due to the record [...] "Fantasy," [...] "R and Hip Hop were the best of step siblings." [...] In the 1998 film Rush Hour, Soo Yong is singing the song while it plays on the car radio, shortly before her kidnapping.

2500|$|This zone {{might also}} be called the dot zone, because its pattern of Y: 讠 U: 冫 I: 氵 and O: 灬 is not {{actually}} necessarily built up of right falling strokes.

2500|$|Dr. Gary Smith, {{professor}} of Population Biology and Epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania, commented {{that very few}} mathematical models of disease transmission take host behavior into account, but also questioned how representative of real life a virtual model could be. He stated that while {{the characteristics of the}} disease could be defined beforehand, the study is just as observational as one conducted on a real-life disease outbreak. However, he added that one <b>could</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> proposal could give an opportunity for a study that epidemiologists may never have. Neil Ferguson, director of the MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling at Imperial College, London, felt skeptical of the idea, commenting that such a study could not properly mimic genuine behavior. Using the zombie plague used to promote [...] before its release as an example, players would intentionally become infected to gain zombie powers. He added that characters could also regenerate, meaning there was low risk in becoming infected. He felt that while online games such as World of Warcraft could be set up to help scientists study epidemics, it will always be limited as their primary use is for entertainment.|$|E
