5|$|The Court also {{rejected}} {{the proposition that}} the principle of proportionality be recognized as a separate ground for judicial review. Rather, it should be subsumed under irrationality, in the sense that if an executive decision is disproportionate it can be said to be irrational in that no reasonable authority <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to such a decision.|$|E
5|$|In the {{accordion}} experiment, Home {{sat at a}} table, with Crookes and another observer {{on either side of}} him, each with a foot on one of Home's feet. Home inserted his hand inside a wire cage that was pushed under the table. One of Home's hands was placed {{on the top of the}} table, and the other inside the cage which held an accordion on the non-key side, so the keyed end was hanging downwards. The accordion was reported to have played musical sounds. However, the amount of light in the room was not stated, and {{the accordion}} was not observed in good light. According to Frank Podmore there was no evidence the accordion played at all, as the keys were not observed to have moved. Podmore suggested the musical sounds <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from an automatic instrument that Home had concealed.|$|E

5|$|This theory {{stems from}} the various rumours {{spreading}} after Centaurs sinking. If Centaur had been in breach of the Hague Convention of 1907, and someone had informed the Japanese of this, I-177 may have been under valid orders to attack. When Centaur left Sydney, her decks were packed with green-uniformed men, and as Field Ambulance uniforms were only distinguishable from other Army uniforms by badge insignia and the colouration of the cloth band ringing the hat, a distant observer could {{have concluded that the}} hospital ship was transporting soldiers. Those witnessing the loading in Sydney would have seen the ambulance drivers bring their weapons aboard, and <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to a similar conclusion. If a spy or informant had passed this information to the Japanese, I-177 could have been lying in wait. The main flaw in this theory is the question of how Nakagawa and his crew were able to predict that Centaur was taking an alternative route and how they were able to determine the new route selected.|$|E

The experimental conditions were such that the photon density in the system was much less than unity.|$|E
25|$|Strictly {{the name}} White Side {{refers to the}} western slope of a nameless summit. However it is often applied to the whole fell for {{convenience}} as was done by Alfred Wainwright.

Wainwright suggested that the fell name <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from the quartz found on the western slope.|$|E
25|$|Internal {{fittings}} {{include a}} mid 13th-century piscina which is joined to three sedilia by continuous moulded scrollwork.

There are also carvings representing monks' heads supporting statues. Apart from the main piscina, two others survive elsewhere in the church, suggesting {{that there may have}} been two subsidiary altars at one point.|$|E

25|$|Guitars <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to Hawaii {{from several}} sources: sailors, missionaries, or {{travelers}} {{to and from}} California. The most frequently told story is that it accompanied the Mexican cowboys (vaqueros) brought by King Kamehameha III in 1832 in order to teach the natives how to control an overpopulation of cattle. The Hawaiian cowboys (paniolo) used guitars in their traditional folk music. The Portuguese introduced an instrument called the braguinha, a small, four-stringed Madeira variant of the cavaquinho; this instrument was a precursor to the `ukulele.|$|E
25|$|In September 2007, the {{rotation}} system came under review, {{and a new}} system was proposed which renders ineligible for bidding only the last two World Cup host confederations. This proposal was adopted on 29 October 2007, in Zurich, Switzerland by FIFA's Executive Committee. Under this policy, a 2018 bid <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from North America, Asia, Europe, or Oceania, as Africa and South America are ineligible. Likewise, no CONMEBOL member {{could have made a}} 2022 bid, and candidates from the same confederation as the successful 2018 applicant would be disregarded in the 2022 selection procedure.|$|E
25|$|The Abou Youssef Elias {{family came}} to the Jebbet Bsharri region in the {{beginning}} of the 17th century from Smar Jbeil, the village of the Gilwan family, ex-owners of the Monastery of Qozhaya. In another documented version, This family <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> originally from Benta‘el in the Jbeil region. This family was encouraged to settle in the region by the Gilwan's and maybe the Hamadeh sheikhs. They settled first in Tourza and Arbet Qozhaya, working as sharecroppers of the Monastery of Qozhaya. After Qozhaya was handed down to the Lebanese Maronite Order in 1708, they moved to Kfarsghab between 1710 and 1720.|$|E

25|$|Others, however, {{reason that}} Houghton Mifflin must have printed the volumes several {{distinct}} times between 1938 {{and the second}} edition of 1951. They point out {{that none of the}} variations <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> about {{during the course of a}} single printing run. Also, thirteen years elapsed between the first printing and the appearance of the second edition; it seems improbable that Houghton Mifflin would not have reprinted the book (presuming the arrangements with Allen & Unwin permitted). And finally, while the bowing hobbit (first printing) version appears on the market uncommonly, first editions as a whole show up scarcely less often than all the printings of the second edition combined.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{also noted}} {{damage on the}} rear of Silkwood's vehicle that, {{according}} to Silkwood's friends and family, had not been present before the accident. As the crash was entirely a front-end collision, it did not explain {{the damage to the}} rear of her vehicle. A microscopic examination of the rear of Silkwood's car showed paint chips that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> only from a rear impact by another vehicle. Silkwood's family claimed to know of no accidents of any kind that Silkwood had had with the car, and that the 1974 Honda Civic she was driving was new when purchased and no insurance claims were filed on that vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Fingerprint identification, {{known as}} dactyloscopy, or hand print identification, {{is the process}} of {{comparing}} two instances of friction ridge skin impressions (see Minutiae), from human fingers or toes, or even the palm of the hand or sole of the foot, to determine whether these impressions <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from the same individual. The flexibility of friction ridge skin means that no two finger or palm prints are ever exactly alike in every detail; even two impressions recorded immediately after each other from the same hand may be slightly different. Fingerprint identification, also referred to as individualization, involves an expert, or an expert computer system operating under threshold scoring rules, determining whether two friction ridge impressions are likely to have originated from the same finger or palm (or toe or sole).|$|E

25|$|On 7 March 2012, a {{forensic}} pathologist, Dr Nathaniel Cary {{told the jury}} that David Gilroy had curved scratches on his hands a cut on his forehead, bruises {{on his chest and}} other scratches to his hands, wrist and forearms on 6 May 2010. A series of photographs were produced in court (left). He told the advocate depute that the scratches could have been caused by another person's fingernails, possibly in a struggle, and that this had happened around the time Ms Pilley went missing. He also said that the injuries were consistent with what he had seen previously in cases involving strangulation, but that it was difficult to tell because the injuries had been covered with a make-up like substance. Under cross-examination Dr Cary confirmed that the scratches on Gilroy's hands <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from gardening activities.|$|E
25|$|For a given {{species in}} a given environment, {{available}} resources will {{limit the number of}} individuals that can survive indefinitely. This is the carrying capacity. Upon reaching this threshold, individuals may find it easier to gather resources in the poorer yet less exploited peripheral environment than in the preferred habitat. Homo habilis could have developed some baseline behavioural flexibility prior to its expansion into the peripheries (such as encroaching into the predatory guild). This flexibility could then have been positively selected and amplified, leading to Homo erectus adaptation to the peripheral open habitats. A new and environmentally flexible hominin population <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> back to the old niche and replace the ancestral population. Moreover, some step-wise shrinking of the woodland and the associated reduction of hominin carrying capacity in the woods around 1.8 Ma, 1.2 Ma, and 0.6 Ma would have stressed the carrying capacity's pressure for adapting to the open grounds.|$|E
