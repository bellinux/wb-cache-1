This paper provides the first chronometric dates for this important burial population. AMS radio <b>carbon</b> <b>determinations</b> on bone collagen from six individuals showed a calibrated 2 σ range from 1027 BC to 1521 AD. On the basis of this sample, the Swanport population appears to pre-date all European contact in Australia. These dates contradict previous assumptions that associated the Swanport burial population with a recent protohistoric period or a discrete period of time related to historic smallpox epidemics in the 19 th century.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} different titrimetric methods of organic <b>carbon</b> <b>determination</b> (OC), using reference soils, compost and sludge as standards, as well as to clarify the effects of the phosphoric acid and the efficiency of the indicators used in the titration. SOC content was determined by 10 wet oxidation methods (7 which are commonly used in soil testing laboratories and 3 methods modified by us). The agreement between certified and measured results suggested that SOC could be completely recovered by using wet digestion under tested method described (except Walkley Black midified method). Organic carbon contents from the Walkley Black modified method were higher in all investigated samples than those obtained by the other titrimetric methods. The most significant increase is observed in the standards 3, 6 and 7, i. e. the standards with the highest content of organic matter. The Tube digestion method and Tjurin method (1500 C with phosphoric acid added before titration) are very effective for soil samples up to 2 % of organic carbon. The Tube digestion method for organic <b>carbon</b> <b>determination</b> seem to be the most suitable methods, for soil samples, compost and sludge with high organic matter content. The indicators do not significantly affect the quantification of organic carbon in most studied samples. The determined values for all standard samples with indicator diphenylamine are little bit than those determined using the N-phenylanlhranilic acid and o-phenanthroline. N-phenylanthranilic acid can be used with H 3 PO 4 addition before titration. Ferroin can be as effective as barium diphenylamine sulfonate if soil is filtered or centrifuged to get clear solution after the addition of water in the procedure, but this process involves a lot of time, hence barium diphenylamine sulfonate and N-phenylanthranilic acid, as indicators, are recommended.

They appear to be dependent only {{on the nature of the}} material which confers porosity. Based on the results of Brown and Dykstra (41) it is reasonable to assume that calculations of reaction rates at temperatures above 550 C were confounded by weight losses from processes other than carbon oxidation and, therefore, are not useful in determination of the temperature dependence of carbon oxidation in fly ash. The results of the present study indicate that temperatures below 550 C should be used for future studies in order to satisfactorily assess the temperature dependence of carbon oxidation in fly ash. Furthermore, it is also advisable that percent <b>carbon</b> <b>determinations</b> be performed on fly ash samples after the oxidation reactions to determine whether all carbon present in fly ash is oxidized. This will ensure that reaction rates are representative of the complete oxidation of carbon. An inverse relationship was determined between reaction rates and oxygen concentration for this study.

A more accurate determination of oxygen dependence of carbon oxidation can be accomplished by the use of specialty gases containing different concentrations of oxygen which could eliminate the need to apply vacuum to the samples...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Carbon budgets vary {{markedly}} {{within and}} between Tagus and Sado estuaries reflecting the human pressure. These estuaries seem to generate carbon within a total of 0. 13 MtC yr - 1 for Tagus and 0. 02 MtC yr - 1 for Sado. Anthropogenic inputs, autochthonous carbon production and primary production are indicated as the main responsible for the carbon production within the estuaries. Carbon exported to the ocean and to the atmosphere by both estuarine systems is higher during the non-productive period. Emissions for the atmosphere represent, in terms of cost, about € 375, 000 per year. This study is important for an efficient protection and preservation of Tagus and Sado estuarine ecosystems and is {{a contribution to the}} integration of coastal and global carbon cycles. 1. INTRODUCTION The coastal environment presents high levels of complexity, diverse habitats and sustains a high level of biodiversity. These provide goods and services that support different uses which should be undertaken in a sustainable way. However, these coastal environments are facing increasing and significant impacts, driven by economic and social pressures. In order to resolve these problems, policy-makers world-wide seek to develop strategies to protect, conserve and manage the coastal environment. To accomplish that is imperative a scientific knowledge of such environments, particularly their role in the carbon and nutrients cycles. Human activities associated with coastal environments, such as land-use change, bulkhead construction, wastewater discharge, wetland removal and dredging, are increasingly important factors that affect carbon sources, cycling and budgets. Climate warming and hydrologic “events” have also resulted in changes to continental shelf carbon cycling (Maher and Eyre, 2012; Bauer et al., 2013). Although future climate change is predicted to lead to an increase in river carbon fluxes, it is also likely to lead to increased uncertainties in predicting these fluxes. Therefore, in management and conservation of coastal waters, the detection and assessment of carbon budgets is an important environmental issue since they can optimize interventions by state agencies and local communities. For a detailed carbon budget calculation it is essential to quantify the air-sea exchange of carbon and also the fluxes of carbon across the land/ocean boundaries. An example of such land/ocean boundaries are estuaries, which are effective filters for terrestrial/riverine organic inputs and impose a by-pass of carbon towards the atmosphere for the global carbon cycle. Furthermore, recent research (Chen and Borges, 2009; Oliveira et al., 2012) points out that estuaries influence strongly how global coastal ocean acts as a source or sink for atmospheric CO 2. In order to characterise the role of two of the greatest Portuguese estuaries (Tagus and Sado) in terms of carbon impacts on the ocean, carbon budgets, integrating simultaneously both inorganic and organic carbon components and CO 2 air-water fluxes, were estimated over an annual cycle. 2. ESTUARIES The Portuguese Tagus and Sado estuaries (Figure 1) are important ecological systems subjected to considerable urban, industrial and agricultural pressures and considered to be moderately productive. These anthropogenic pressures, expressed as chemical oxygen demand (COD), reach values of 131, 743 t yr - 1 and 30, 385 t yr - 1, respectively for Tagus and Sado river basins (APA, 2014). Figure 1. Map of Portugal showing Tagus and Sado estuaries. The two well mixed mesotidal estuaries were selected as they are close geographically, vary in freshwater inputs, span a range of river to marine dominated systems and are geomorphically distinct (Table 1). 3. METHODOLOGY 3. 1. Data Carbon budgets are based predominantly on direct measured of carbon flows. Carbon seasonal measurements were conducted from 1999 to 2004 on Tagus and Sado estuaries. Additionally, physical, chemical and biological parameters were also determined, generating a multiparameter data base contributing to a better knowledge of water quality changes in the systems and therefore respond to the Water Framework Directive. 3. 2. Carbon Analytical Procedures Particulate organic (POC) and inorganic (PIC) <b>carbon</b> <b>determinations</b> were made using a CHN Fissons NA 1500 Analyser. The calibration standard used was acetanilide. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis were performed by high temperature catalytic oxidation (HTCO), using a commercial Shimadzu TOC- 5000 A analyser. Samples were acidified to pH 3 PO 4 acid and immediately frozen until analyses. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and the CO 2 partial pressure (pCO 2) in seawater were calculated from in situ temperature, total alkalinity (TA) and corrected pH using the carbonic acid dissociation constants given by Millero et al. (2006) and the CO 2 solubility coefficient of Weiss (1974). Errors associated with DIC and pCO 2 calculations were estimated to be, respectively, ± 6 µmol kg - 1 and ± 10 µatm (accumulated errors on TA and pH). The air-water CO 2 fluxes were computed according to the equation CO 2 Flux = kspCO 2, where k is the gas transfer velocity (given by Wanninkhof, 1992), s is the solubility coefficient of CO 2 and pCO 2 is the air-water gradient of pCO 2. 4. RESULTS Results revealed significant differences between both estuaries in terms of carbon inputs and outputs. Carbon fluxes are always higher in Tagus than in Sado. Carbon exported to the ocean by both estuarine systems is higher during the non-productive period, with values reaching 2258 tC d - 1 for Tagus and 41 tC d - 1 for Sado. Emissions for the atmosphere, are also higher during the non-productive period, attaining values of 220 tC d - 1 and 60 tC d - 1, respectively for Tagus and Sado estuaries. Pricing these emissions at the current tax (May 7, 2014), they represent in terms of cost about € 375, 000. Extrapolating for an annual basis, Tagus exports a total of 0. 52 MtC yr - 1, of which 90 % goes to the ocean and 10 % is emitted to the atmosphere, while Sado estuary exports 0. 04 MtC yr - 1, of which 40 % is exported to the ocean and 60 % is emitted to the atmosphere (Figure 2). Carbon balance indicates that 0. 13 MtC yr - 1 for Tagus and 0. 02 MtC yr - 1 for Sado (Figure 2) are generated inside the system suggesting other sources of carbon, besides the river inputs. Figure 2. Annual carbon inputs and outputs in Tagus and Sado estuaries. Values in MtC yr - 1. According to APA (2014), and converting COD to TOC, the total anthropogenic loading for Tagus and Sado river basins is of 0. 04 MtC yr - 1 and 0. 01 MtC yr - 1, respectively. Therefore, in both estuaries anthropogenic sources inputs of organic carbon are extremely high, although this fraction comprises only 15 % and 8 % of the total carbon pool, respectively for Tagus and Sado estuaries. The major contribution of carbon is both estuaries is in the inorganic form. Considering the population within these two river basins, it can be infrared that every year each inhabitant roughly releases 12. 6 and 29. 3 kg of carbon to Tagus and Sado superficial waters, respectively. 5. CONCLUSIONS The results presented illustrate that Tagus and Sado estuaries represent an important land/ocean boundary for carbon transformation and emission, and confirm the anthropogenic pressure that these estuaries are subject to. Carbon budgets vary markedly {{within and between}} these two estuaries reflecting the human pressure. Anthropogenic inputs, autochthonous carbon production and primary production are indicated as the main responsible for the carbon production within the estuaries. Both estuaries export carbon to the ocean and to the atmosphere. The inorganic carbon faction has {{a major role in the}} carbon budget, enriching the ocean in carbon dioxide, contributing this for the greenhouse effect. Our understanding of organic and inorganic carbon fluxes in Tagus and Sado estuaries is vital for an efficient protection and preservation of such ecosystems being helpful in limit human-caused damage and in restoring damaged estuarine/coastal ecosystems. In addition, the economic impact of the carbon fluxes to the atmosphere, estimated as € 375, 000 per year, creates the appropriate incentives to reduce emissions and shift them to higher-value uses. Suggesting, therefore, a coastal management re-oriented towards a more adaptive approach through the use of carbon market-based policies. This study is a contribution to the integration of coastal and global carbon cycles. However, additional efforts are required to fully merge other components subsystems, such as salt marshes, with these budgets. Moreover, a fully comprehension of the community metabolism in these estuaries will greatly improve this integration...|$|E

The solution for photo degradation measurement is prepared by adding 0.1  g/L of magnesium aluminate nanoparticles +  10  mg/L of methylene blue dye +  100  mL of water. Prior to illumination, the suspension is magnetically stirred continuously {{in the dark}} for 1  h to disperse the catalyst and establish an adsorption/desorption equilibrium. After that, the suspension is irradiated with UV light. During irradiation process, stirring is continued to keep the mixture in suspension. At given time intervals of irradiation, 5  mL of the dye solution is sampled and centrifugated immediately to remove the of magnesium aluminate nanoparticles. The change in methylene blue dye concentration in each photo degraded solution is monitored by two sets of measurements. Firstly, the maximum absorbance of methylene blue dye is measured at λ max =  270  nm in an ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Lambda 35). Secondly, the total organic carbon is determined by CHN analyzer (Elementar Vario EL III). Prior to the total organic <b>carbon</b> <b>determination,</b> the solution is filtered through a filter of 0.2  μm pore size to remove photocatalysts.|$|R

A series of microbial mats were sampled on the hypoxic {{region of the}} Crimean Shelf. Concentrations of organic carbon (Corg) and nitrogen (N) were measured on finely powdered, freeze-dried subsamples of sediment using a using a Fisons NA- 1500 elemental analyzer. For organic <b>carbon</b> <b>determination</b> samples were pre-treated with 12. 5 % HCl to remove carbonates. Chlorophyll a (chl a), phaeopigments (PHAEO) and chloroplastic pigment equivalents (CPE) was measured according to Schubert et al., (2005) and total hydrolyzable amino acids (THAA) and single amino acid: ASP, GLU, SER, HIS, GLY, THR, ARG, ALA, TYR, MET, VAL, PHE, ILE, LEU, LYS following Dauwe et al., 1998.

40|$|The article {{describes}} the research on the removal of organic matter from natural underground water using biofiltration process. The study {{was carried out in}} semi-technical scale on a model filter composed of activated carbon WD-extra. The development of biological activity in a biosorption bed, as well as observations on the relationship between the processes of sorption and biodegradation was evaluated based on the Eberhardt, Madsen, Sontheimer (EMS) test. Leading operation control parameters of biologically active carbon filter BAF included: change of TOC content, dissolved oxygen and permanganate index. To evaluate the colonization of granular <b>carbon</b> <b>determination</b> of ATP value was used. The presence of the biofilm was found by observation using light and scanning microscopes. The organic compounds in the water taken were adsorbed 100 % and 70 % biodegradable. The combination of sorption process with biodegradation until depletion of activated carbon adsorption capacity allowed in the initial phase of coalbed work for the removal of organic matter in approx. 100 %. Formation of biofilm at the right time allowed to extend the filtration cycle and helped lower the TOC by 70 %, i. e. from 10 mg C/l to 3 - 4 mg C/l...|$|R
40|$|Samples of Lower {{to middle}} Cretaceous rocks from ODP Sites 638, 640, and 641, drilled on the Galicia {{continental}} margin {{in the northeast}} Atlantic, have been investigated by organic geochemical methods (i. e., organic <b>carbon</b> <b>determination,</b> Rock-Eval pyrolysis, kerogen microscopy, gas chromatography, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry) to define the Organofacies types and the depositional environments of these sediments. The {{results of this study}} fit well into the general picture drawn for the depositional history of the organic matter in Cretaceous organic-carbon-rich sediments in the North Atlantic from previous DSDP investigations. During the Valanginian to Albian, terrigenous organic carbon dominated the organic matter deposited on the Galicia continental margin. Cyclic changes in total organic carbon content were probably controlled by climatic-triggered changes in the supply of terrigenous organic matter from the nearby continent. A drastic change in depositional environment must have occurred near the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary. The preservation of large amounts of marine organic carbon in these sediments was probably caused by anoxic deep-water conditions during that time, rather than high productivity. All of the primary organic matter of the sediment samples investigated is thermally immature, as indicated by very low vitrinite reflectance values...|$|R
40|$|Thirty {{sediment}} {{samples from}} Tortonian to Pleistocene {{age of five}} ODP locations (Holes 650 A, 651 A, and 652 A, and Sites 654 and 655) in the Marsili Basin, Vavilov Basin, and Sardinia Margin (Tyrrhenian Sea) were studied by organic geochemical methods including total organic <b>carbon</b> <b>determination,</b> Rock-Eval pyrolysis, bitumen extraction, pyrolysis-gas chromatography, and organic petrography. Six organic facies, including open ocean anoxia with variable terrestrial input, oxic open ocean, oxic tidal flat, mildly oxic lagoon, and anoxic lacustrine algal-bacterial mat environments, have been recognized in these sediments. The sediments below 500 m in Sardinia Margin are mature for significant hydrocarbon generation. Possible mature source-rock (Type I and IIB/III kerogen) and migrated bitumen occur in the deeper part of the section in Vavilov Basin and Sardinia Margin sediments. Sporadic sapropel formation observed in the studied Pliocene-Pleistocene sediment section is probably controlled by organic productivity due to nutrient supply by the rivers and terrestrial input associated with open ocean anoxia or anoxia caused by the material balance between rate of organic matter supplied by turbidites and organic matter consumption. Pliocene and Pleistocene sapropels are mostly immature and lie within Type II-III (precisely as IIA-IIB and IIB source rocks) kerogen maturation path...|$|R

A systematic method of <b>carbon</b> concentration <b>determination</b> based on a combination of X-ray diffraction and X-ray re?ectivity is examined. The grown layers were annealed using rapid thermal annealing and analysed with X-ray diffraction, X-ray re?ectivity and secondary ion mass spectrometry.

40|$|Soil quality {{represents}} an integral value of com-positional structures {{and functions of}} terrestrial soils {{in relation to their}} different use and to long-term environmental conditions on site (Filip 2001). This author stressed in his review paper follow-ing ecologically important soil characteristics: microbial biomass, composition of microflora, mineralization and synthesising processes. Some other authors (Dušek et al. 1997, Škoda et al. 1997, Růžek et al. 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005) preferred pre-cise descriptions using biological characteristics like respiration, ammonification, nitrification, enzyme activities and microbial biomass <b>carbon</b> <b>determination.</b> Many methods determining both quantity of microorganisms and their activity can be used for the characterisation of soil biological quality. Voříšek et al. (2002) used three or eight parameters (microbial biomass carbon [MBC]; ratio MBC/ Corg; ratio EC/MBC; potential respiration with glucose; potential ammonification with peptone; potential nitrification with ammonium sulphate and two model predicted values) {{for the study of the}} influence of grassing and harvest manage-ment. Zaman et al. (2002) used three parameters (MBC, microbial biomass N and extracellular enzyme activities) in different soil depths. Růžek et al. (2004) evaluated Cambisols (Inceptisols) and Luvisols (Alfisols) by six biological criteria (MBC and five ratios: MBC/Corg; EC/MBC; potential/ basal respiration; potential/control ammonifica-tion; potential/control nitrification).
