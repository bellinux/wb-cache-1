40|$|The {{microvascular}} {{network of}} the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) is frequently {{used as a}} model to investigate angiogenesis. Up to now, the quantification of the vessel system has been unsatisfactory because it was performed by a subjective classification {{without regard to the}} capillaries. For the detection of the transparent <b>capillaries</b> the <b>movement</b> of the erythrocytes was used in a non-invasive process. To this end, the erythrocyte flow was recorded in a digital film sequence. To detect the <b>capillaries</b> the <b>movement</b> of the membrane was separated from the erythrocyte <b>movement.</b> The <b>capillaries</b> were separated from the background by analyzing a histogram. The result is a binary image of the microvascular network. A wave-like algorithm was established to extract the interesting parameters of the vessel system. The influence of noise can be reduced by this algorithm. Also the numbers of bifurcations, the cross section of the vessels and the length between two bifurcations can be evaluated. The influence of biomaterials, like prosthetic meshes for hernia repair, was quantified by the fractal dimension. It was shown that the fractal dimension {{is a function of the}} distance to the biomaterial. With this new method the microvascular network of the CAM can be evaluated automatically. It can also be used for all angiogenetic tests on the CAM, such as the investigation of tumor tissue...|$|R

50|$|For {{controlling}} secondary efflorescence, admixtures containing aqueous-based {{calcium stearate}} dispersion (CSD) are often added {{at a later}} stage of the batching process with the mix water. In a typical batching process, sand is first charged into the mixer, then the oil-based primary anti-efflorescence admixture is added with constant mixing to allow the oil to coat the sand. Then coarse aggregates, colorants, and cement are added, followed by water. If CSD is used, it is then introduced usually at this point during or after {{the addition of the}} mix water. CSD is an aqueous dispersion wherein fine solid particles of calcium stearate are suspended in the water uniformly. Commercially available CSD has an average particle size of about 1 to 10 micrometres. The uniform distribution of CSD in the mix may render the resulting concrete masonry unit water repellent, as CSD particles are well distributed in the pores of the unit to interfere with the <b>capillary</b> <b>movement</b> of water.|$|E
50|$|Water is {{essential}} for all the major chemical weathering reactions. To be effective in soil formation, water must penetrate the regolith. The seasonal rainfall distribution, evaporative losses, site topography, and soil permeability interact to determine how effectively precipitation can influence soil formation. The greater the depth of water penetration, the greater the depth of weathering of the soil and its development. Surplus water percolating through the soil profile transports soluble and suspended materials from the upper layers (eluviation) to the lower layers (illuviation), including clay particles and dissolved organic matter. It may also carry away soluble materials in the surface drainage waters. Thus, percolating water stimulates weathering reactions and helps differentiate soil horizons. Likewise, a deficiency of water {{is a major factor}} in determining the characteristics of soils of dry regions. Soluble salts are not leached from these soils, and in some cases they build up to levels that curtail plant and microbial growth. Soil profiles in arid and semi-arid regions are also apt to accumulate carbonates and certain types of expansive clays (calcrete or caliche horizons). In tropical soils, when the soil has been deprived of vegetation (e.g. by deforestation) and thereby is submitted to intense evaporation, the upward <b>capillary</b> <b>movement</b> of water, which has dissolved iron and aluminum salts, is responsible for the formation of a superficial hard pan of laterite or bauxite, respectively, which is improper for cutivation, a known case of irreversible soil degradation (lateritization, bauxitization).|$|E

For the water table and impervious layer condition soil moisture distribution during the experiment was small for Kuroboku soil. Soil moisture distribution for Masa soil, especially for the impervious condition, was large. Response of upward flux from the water table after start and upward flux deterioration after end of radiation were larger and quicker for Kuroboku soil {{compared with that of}} Masa soil. The simulation results were in good agreement with that of the experiment. The difference in the characteristics of soil moisture distribution and upward <b>capillary</b> <b>movement</b> between the soils could be explained by the difference in their water retentivity and hydraulic conductivity...|$|E

With the onset of World War I, Germany began converting ammonia from this process into a synthetic Chilean saltpeter, which was as practical as the natural compound in production of gunpowder and other munitions. By the 1940s, this conversion process resulted in a dramatic decline in demand for sodium nitrate procured from natural sources.|$|R

A porous materialcontaining single liquids and mixtures of organic solvents wasisothermally dried. Experiments were performed using a jacketedwind tunnel, through which a humidity andtemperature-controlled air stream flowed. The wetted porousmaterial {{was placed in}} a cylindrical vessel, whose top isexposed to the air stream until the material became dried to acertain extent. Drying experiments with the single solventswater, methanol, ethanol and 2 -propanol, were performed atdifferent temperatures and transient liquid content profileswere determined. In isothermal drying experiments with liquidmixtures,the transient concentration profiles of thecomponents along the cylindrical sample as well as the totalliquid content were determined. The liquid mixtures examinedwere water-methanolethanol and isopropanol-methanol-ethanol. Two different temperatures and initial compositions were usedin the experiments. Mathematical models that describe nonsteadystate isothermal drying of a solid containing single liquidsand multicomponent liquid mixtures were developed. In the solidwetted with a single liquid, <b>capillary</b> <b>movement</b> of the liquidwas the main mechanism responsible for mass transfer. In thesolid containing liquid mixtures, interactive diffusion inliquid phase was superimposed to the <b>capillary</b> <b>movement</b> of theliquid mixture. In addition, interactive diffusion of thevapours in empty pores was considered. The parameters todescribe the retention properties of the solid and thecapillary movement of the liquid were determined by comparingtheoretical and experimental liquid content profiles obtainedduring drying of the solid wetted with single liquids. Tosimulate the transport of the liquid mixtures these parameterswhere weighed according to liquid composition. A fairly goodagreement between theoretical and experimental liquidcomposition profiles was obtained if axial dispersion isincluded in the model when the moisture consists of amixture.

Like most systems of nature, the decay process of stone is complex. The monument in question {{will be affected by}} a variety of weathering processes. The ultimate goal is to identify all processes and differentiate their effects. Characterization, detailed observations, periodic measuring and the occasional sampling of the monument reveal weathering processes. The monument was closely observed from October 2013 through March 2014. Copious amounts of literature is available that document techniques and methods for the evaluation of stone properties such as porosity, permeability and <b>capillary</b> <b>movement.</b> Furthermore the Salem limestone is a well-studied building material. Simple methods are explored by the author in hopes of providing a basic interpretation of decay observed on the monument. Observations include absorption and dehydration rates, salt precipitation, <b>capillary</b> <b>movement,</b> discoloration, staining, and surface alteration. The most noticeable change is discoloration. The discoloration comes {{from a variety of sources}} such as atmospheric pollution and the oxidation of Iron-bearing minerals. Efflorescence of salt also causes a white discoloration although the salt is soluble and is quickly washed off by rain. The removal of efflorescence accounts for a miniscule amount of statue material but should be considered part of the decay process. Present observations and research lead to a conclusion that the short term decay of Salem limestone is negligible and the stone is resistant to decay and weathering at the scale of a human’s lifespan. This research provides consumers evidence of Salem limestone’s durability and helps to explain the popularity of Salem limestone as a building material. [URL]...|$|E

Soil columns (20 cm in diameter and 60 cm high) were constructed with two soil types (pH ~ 6. 4 and pH ~ 3. 1) and four treatments were assayed: with/without liming and with/without vegetation. The pH, Eh, EC, WSOC and soluble metals (Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, Zn) were monitored at three depths: 5 (never under water), 30 (alternating flooding-drying conditions), and 55 (always under water) cm. In the slightly acidic soil liming decreased Cd, Mn and Zn soluble concentrations regardless of the hydric regime and the presence of Phragmites. However, it contributed to Cu and Pb mobilization under permanent flooding conditions (55 cm depth). In the non-liming treatments the presence of vegetation hindered the drop of Eh in the deepest 55 cm and contributed to maintain higher Cd solubility. In the strongly acidic soil liming decreased Cu, Cd, Pb and Zn soluble concentrations but not Mn. In this soil the presence of Phragmites contributed to higher soluble metal concentrations at 5 cm depth due to the <b>capillary</b> upward <b>movement</b> of water with solutes (salts and metals).

The renal clearance of 99 mTc-EHDP was 24 ml/min and was unaffected by the action of parathyroid hormone. After a fracture the bone blood flow increases, although the transcapillary extraction of 99 mTc-EHDP does not change. This is because there is an increase, from recruitment and dilatation of capillaries, in the surface area available for exchange.

Waterlogging did not affect shoot or root biomass production nor nodulation in A. americana, whereas D. virgatus had its highest dry matter production in saturated soil (T 1).  In M. lathyroides flooding tolerance was more evident in the reproductive than in the vegetative stage, probably due to more production of adventitious roots and formation of aerenchymatic tissue.   Macroptilium atropurpureum showed adaptation to temporary flooding.  Survival and quick recovery of these species would confirm their potential as forages for temporarily waterlogged soils.

30|$|Woodcock et al. [36] {{recently}} {{evaluated the}} basic physiological and molecular principles behind transvascular fluid exchange and {{called into question}} completeness of the initial Starling force principle. They propose a revised Starling model, which takes into account not only {{the composition of the}} intravascular fluid and the interstitial fluid, but also the physical characteristics of the transvascular barrier, which comprises of the endothelial glycocalyx layer and endothelial basement membrane, with tight junctions between cells and the extracellular matrix [40]. According to this revised model, when the vascular barrier is intact, transcapillary movement of fluid is unidirectional, as there is no absorption of fluid from the interstitium back to the intravascular space, and drainage of the interstitium is accomplished primarily by lymphatic clearance. Transcapillary movement is then dependent on capillary pressure. At supranormal capillary pressures, infusion of colloid solution preserves oncotic pressure and increases capillary pressure, thus increasing movement of fluid into the interstitial space. Under the same conditions, infusion of crystalloid solutions also increases capillary pressure, but by dilution decreases oncotic pressure, thus resulting in more transcapillary movement than colloids. At subnormal <b>capillary</b> pressures, transcapillary <b>movement</b> nears zero; thus, infusion of both crystalloids and colloids results in increase in capillary pressure, but no change in transcapillary movement.|$|R
40|$|A new {{expression}} of the time derivative of predawn leaf water potential was proposed by equalizing two expressions of the grapevine transpiration. This expression was established when transpiration is the only driver of the vineyard water balance. Under Mediterranean climate, this condition is met {{for long periods of}} drought i. e. most of the summer time under the hypothesis that there is no water <b>movement</b> (<b>capillary</b> rise) from the deep layers of the soil. The proposed approach showed that changes in predawn leaf water potential (Psi(pd)) values are in inverse relation with the Total Transpirable Soil Water (TTSW) which characterizes the maximal water stock of the soil and in direct relation with reference evapotranspiration (ET.) and the basal crop coefficient (k(cb)) of the vine. The relation between Psi(pd) changes and cumulated ETo is linear with a slope related to the ratio of "k(cb) to TTSW". This ratio can be therefore estimated from field measurements and climatic data. This approach was tested on two year observations performed by Acevedo-Opazo et al. (2010) in vineyards cultivated with cv. Shiraz and Mourvedre, without any irrigation. Analysis of the data obtained in 49 sites per vineyard for several dates in the very dry summers of 2003 (Shiraz) and 2005 (Mourvedre) showed strong and significant adjustments of the model. These results proved the linear relationship between the sum of ETo and Psi(pd). For each site of the vineyard, the approach demonstrated the possibility to provide site-specific estimates of the ratio of k(cb) to TTSW. This theoretical and practical development could have applications for water management and soil studies in Mediterranean vineyards...|$|R

Measurements of internal diameter and transmural pressures were obtained during continuous increases in pressure from 0 to 200 mm Hg.

To measure the hydraulic conductivity, segments of the carotid artery were isolated, filled with a 4 % oxygenated albumin-Tyrode's solution, and connected to a <b>capillary</b> tube.

Inoculation of potted banana by drenching potting mix with a conidial suspension, consisting mostly of microconidia, few macroconidia and no chlamydospores, generated from one-quarter-strength potato dextrose agar + streptomycin sulfate, resulted in inconsistent infection. When a conidial suspension that consisted of all three spore types, microconidia, macroconidia and chlamydospores, prepared from spores generated on carnation leaf agar was used, all plants became infected, indicating that the spore type present in conidial suspensions may contribute to inconsistency of infection.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of a novel barrier cream formulation at reducing the percutaneous toxicity of a 2 xLD(50) liquid challenge of nerve agent (VX). The study was conducted in vitro and in vivo using the domestic pig. Pretreatment of the (inner ear skin) exposure site with barrier cream eliminated mortality, reduced cholinesterase inhibition and prevented any physiological or biochemical signs of intoxication. In contrast, untreated animals exposed to VX exhibited severe signs of intoxication, near total AChE inhibition and generally died within the (3 hr) exposure period (5 / 6 animals). Application of the barrier cream caused a significant decrease in the area of skin contaminated by VX. It was tentatively concluded that spreading was predominantly a surface phenomena (possibly mediated by <b>capillary</b> <b>movement</b> of the agent through the microrelief or between hair follicles) with little or no contribution from lateral diffusion within the stratum corneum. There was a disparity between the in vitro and in vivo skin absorption measurements that was ascribed to the absence of systemic clearance in vitro. However, both models indicated a substantial reservoir of VX within the skin, providing a potential strategy for future investigations into "catch-up therapies". In summary, the novel barrier cream formulation was effective against a 2 xLD(50) (liquid, percutaneous) dose of VX applied for 3 hr. Further work should be conducted to investigate more pragmatic issues such as optimal reapplication frequency and environmental effects such as temperature and humidity...|$|E
40|$|According {{to recent}} soil survey data, {{it has been}} {{reported}} that acid sulfate soils cover areas of about 11, 670, 000 hectares all over the world and about 40 % of those are in South-East Asia. Most of crops could not be grown on those areas without any amelioration due to low soil pH. This report consists of two parts. One is on acid sulfate soil formation in laboratory experiment. Another is on a trial of acid sulfate soil amelioration in field experiment. The results obtained on acid sulfate soil formation, in order to make clear the relationships between the process of oxidation of sulfur compounds and the moisture conditions (moisture suction) in coastal muddy soils, in laboratory experiment are summarized as follows; The concentration of sulfuric ions increase as oxidation of sulfur compounds contained in pyrite, etc. occurs, and as a consequence, the soil pH decreases in the coastal muddy soil (Fig. 1). Especially, the soil pH decreased remarkably in the range of pF 2. 3 ~ 3. 4. The activity of soil microorganism takes part in this reaction by helping out with bringing about sulfur oxidation and formation of sulfuric ions. The pH decrease in the soil with autoclaved treatment was only slight at pF values lower than pF 3. 0. Accordingly, it is concluded that the decrease of pH in coastal muddy soil occurred mainly due to soil microorganisms which oxidize sulfur compounds under the condition of higher-water than pF 3. 0. The results of field experiment is summarized as follows; As a general rule, it is able to remedy the surface acidification of peat/acid sulfate soils by mixing lime dust with plough layer. However, the effect of mixed lime dust is easily disappeared in the area where the acidic ground water table is always high and moves up over the surface in rainy season. Therefore, it was carried out that several experiments for seeking protection against surface acidification due to <b>capillary</b> upward <b>movement</b> of acidic ground water by means of inserting a buffering layer of lime gravel (thickness of lime gravel layer = 5 ㎝) between the top soil and the acidic subsoil (20 ㎝ depth) in the fields, Munoh series which is young acid sulfate soil, at the Narathiwat Land Development Center in South Thailand. The results of soil pH measurement carried out in the field in November of 1985, August of 1987 and September of 1990, it coincides with 2, 4 and 7 years respectively after the beginning of the experiments, are shown in Table 3. In the plot of P 2 and U 1, application of lime dust to the plough layer can increase soil pH rapidly but it's residual effect is not so long. Within a 5 year period, the soil pH is likely to return to below 4. On the other hand, an underlaid lime gravel layer tends to improve the soil around the lime gravel only slight but steadily with time. Therefore, it is concluded that surface soil acidification caused by the upward movement of acidified ground water would be protected against, rapidly and continuously, by both mixing lime dust with plough layer and underlying lime gravel below plough layer.

40|$|Abstract Background Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, a prodrug of the {{nucleotide}} {{reverse transcriptase}} inhibitor, tenofovir (9 -[9 (R) - 2 -(phosphonomethoxy) propyl]adenine; PMPA), was recently approved {{for use in}} the combination therapy of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) - 1 infection. This study was undertaken to understand PMPA distribution to the virus sanctuary sites located in the brain, CSF and choroid plexuses and to clarify its possible role in reducing the neurological problems associated with HIV infection. Methods The methods used included an established bilateral carotid artery perfusion of [3 H]PMPA and a vascular marker, D-[14 C]mannitol, in anaesthetised guinea-pigs followed by scintillation counting, HPLC and <b>capillary</b> depletion analyses. <b>Movement</b> of [3 H]PMPA into the brain, cisternal CSF and lateral ventricle choroid plexus was also examined in the absence and presence of additional anti-HIV drugs and a transport inhibitor. Control and test groups were compared by ANOVA or Student's t -test, as appropriate. Results The distribution of [3 H]PMPA in the cerebrum, cerebellum, pituitary gland and cerebral capillary endothelial cells was not significantly different to that measured for D-[14 C]mannitol. However, [3 H]PMPA accumulation was significantly higher than that of D-[14 C]mannitol in the choroid plexus and CSF. Further experiments revealed no cross-competition for transport of [3 H]PMPA by probenecid, a non-specific inhibitor of organic anion transport, or the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors into any of the CNS regions studied. The octanol-saline partition coefficient measurement for [3 H]PMPA was 0. 0134 ± 0. 00003, which is higher that the 0. 002 ± 0. 0004 measured for D-[14 C]mannitol in an earlier study. Conclusion There is negligible transport of [3 H]PMPA across the blood-brain barrier, but it can cross the blood-CSF barrier. This {{is a reflection of the}} differing physiological and functional characteristics of the blood-CNS interfaces. Self- and cross-inhibition studies did not suggest the involvement of a transport system in the CNS distribution of this drug. However, the ability of PMPA to accumulate in the choroid plexus tissue, but not the cerebral capillary endothelial cells, and the hydrophilic nature of PMPA, does point to the possibility of a transporter at the level of the choroid plexus. PMPA that has crossed the choroid plexus and is in the CSF could treat HIV-infected perivascular and meningeal macrophages, but it is unlikely to reach the infected microglia of deep brain sites. </p...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{concept of}} {{repeatedly}} connecting an extracorporeal blood pump to produce pancycle suprasystolic inflow pressures to ischemic limbs is introduced. Balloon catheters allow for limb {{isolation from the}} systemic circulation. In the acute phase, {{it is assumed that}} pressure is proportion to flow (Poiseuille's Law) and in the chronic phase that collateral growth is related to endothelial shear stress and wall tension. The primary objective was to establish that increased flow could be achieved through collateral circulation in animals and in man with extracorporeal limb hyperperfusion. The second objective was to develop and test an arterial access system capable of intermittent regional hyperperfusion similar in concept to intermittent hemodialysis. Finally, to demonstrate the translocation of these concepts into humans facing major limb amputation where all standard treatment options had been exhausted. MethodsTwelve sheep (6 hyperperfusion and 6 controls) were attached to a cardiac vortex pump and perfused at 200 mm Hg pancycle with the superficial femoral artery doubly ligated and isolated from the systemic circulation with a balloon catheter. Pressure transducers measured carotid and distal femoral pressures and the carotid-femoral index was calculated. To allow hyperperfusion to be repeated transcutaneously, a peripheral access system (PAS [Allvascular, St Leonards, New South Wales, Australia]) was constructed. This device was implanted in the common carotid artery in 8 sheep and opened approximately 3 days a week for continuous arterial access up to 37 days for 67 openings. To demonstrate these principles in humans, 3 patients with critically ischemic limbs were hyperperfused intermittently. Digital thermography compared the other limb as controls and provided objective evidence of the vascular changes. ResultsThe mean carotid-femoral index was 0. 6 ± 0. 01 for controls compared with 1. 1 ± 0. 28 for the hyperperfusion group (P <. 001). The collateral flow was superior to normal flow (ie, with the superficial femoral not occluded). Continuous access to the carotid arterial tree via the access device was 25. 3 ± 8. 8 days with 5 of 8 devices open for the entire observational period (maximum 37 days). The human ischemic limbs were hyperperfused at 2 - 4 times the mean arterial pressure producing 3 - 6 times an increase in pump flow measurements intermittently for 53 ± 16 hours. The clinical findings of rest pain, paresthesia, <b>capillary</b> return, and <b>movement</b> showed dramatic improvement as did thermographic emissions. Major amputation was avoided in the cases presented. ConclusionBlood flow through collaterals can be very significantly augmented by connection to an extracorporeal pump with isolation from the systemic circulation. The pancycle hyperperfusion can be safely repeated by implantation of an arterial access device. In the longer term, there is evidence of collateral development. When amputation is the only alternative, hypertensive extracorporeal limb perfusion should be considered...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the transport coefficients involved in mass and heat transfer during the drying of a porous solid partially saturated with multicomponent mixtures.   It included the coefficients governing liquid transport through the solid, the matrix of multicomponent diffusion coefficients in the liquid phase, and the effective thermal conductivity.   As {{it is not possible}} to determine these coefficients by theoretical considerations alone and considerable experimental work is required to determine them in a broad range of process conditions, the principle of this study has been the use of mathematical models complemented with some empirical parameters.   These empirical parameters were determined by comparison between measurements in specially designed experiments and the results of mathematical models that describe the process.   In addition, the application of the multicomponent diffusion coefficients is described in two cases where liquid diffusion is important: convective evaporation of a multicomponent stationary liquid film and a falling film. To study liquid transport through the solid, isothermal drying experiments were performed to determine the transient composition profiles and total liquid content of sand samples wetted with ternary liquid mixtures with different initial compositions and temperatures.   A mathematical model including mass transfer by <b>capillary</b> <b>movement</b> of the liquid and interactive diffusion in both the gas and liquid phases was developed.   To simulate the <b>capillary</b> <b>movement</b> of liquid mixtures, parameters experimentally determined for single liquids were weighed according to liquid composition. A fairly good agreement between theoretical and experimental liquid composition profiles was obtained considering that axial dispersion was included in the model. To study the matrix of multicomponent diffusion coefficients in the liquid phase, the redistribution of liquid composition in a partially filled tube exposed to a longitudinal temperature gradient was analysed.   Experimental work was carried out using two main ternary mixtures with different initial compositions and temperature gradients.   Experimental data were compared with the results of a theoretical model that describes the steady-state liquid composition distribution in a partially filled non-isothermal tube to find the empirical exponent that modifies the matrix of thermodynamic factors.   Correlations for the exponents as a function of temperature were determined for each particular multicomponent mixture. The effective thermal conductivity of a porous solid containing multicomponent liquid mixtures was studied by measuring the liquid composition, liquid content and temperature distributions in a cylindrical sample dried by convection from the open upper side and heated by contact with a hot source at the bottom side.   Simulations performed at a quasi steady state were compared with experiments to estimate the adjusting geometric parameter of Krischer’s model for effective thermal conductivity, which includes the contribution of the evaporation-diffusion-condensation mechanism. The results revealed that a resistance corresponding to a parallel arrangement between the phases seems to dominate in this case. In the study of the convective drying of a multicomponent stationary liquid film, the equations describing interactive mass transfer were decoupled by a similarity transformation and solved simultaneously with a conduction equation by the method of variable separation.   Variations of physical properties along the process trajectory were taken into account by a stepwise application of the solution in time intervals with averaged coefficients from previous time steps.   Despite simplifications, the analytical solution gives a good insight into the selectivity of the drying process and is computationally fast.  On the other hand, numerical simulations of the convective evaporation of the multicomponent falling liquid film into an inert gas with a co-current flow arrangement of the phases almost always revealed a transition from liquid-phase-controlled conditions to a process in which neither the gas nor the liquid completely controls the evaporation. The results obtained in this work would be useful in implementing models to improve the design, process exploration and optimisation of dryers by incorporating the solid-side effects to describe the drying of liquid mixtures along the whole process.

40|$|Iron ore pellets are {{a highly}} refined product and for {{companies}} such as LKAB {{it is important to}} constantly improve the pelletization in order to enhance production and improve product quality. A long term goal has been established to develop and considerably refine tools and techniques with which the drying zone of a pelletizing plant can be optimized. The aim with this research project is to numerically investigate how material and processing parameters influence the drying. This will be applied to several scales: i) The constituents of the pellets and their properties and geometry. ii) The geometry of the pellet, their permeability and size distribution. iii) The geometry of the bed and the processing conditions including the state of the air (ex. humidity, temperature and velocity). To start with, a pellet bed model of velocity and temperature distribution in the up-draught drying zone without regard to moisture transport is developed with aid of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Results from simulations show a rapid cooling of air due to the high specific surface area in the porous material. Following this work, heat and mass transport within a single pellet during drying is modeled. Heat transfer and convective transport of water and air through the capillaries of the porous media is computed and vaporization by boiling is taken into account. A sensitivity analysis shows {{that it is important to}} use a realistic value of the convective heat transfer coefficient when the vaporization of water is a dominating drying mechanism while the temperature of the solid and <b>capillary</b> <b>movement</b> of water is not influenced to the same extent. The derived model is applicable to a number of numerical set up such as a single pellet placed in infinite space. To further develop a single pellet model, forced convective heating of a porous media with surrounding flow field taken into account must first be examined. Therefore, a two dimensional model with properties similar to that of an iron ore pellet is numerically investigated. With interface heat transfer condition provided by CFD, the heat transfer and fluid flow around and within a porous cylinder is examined. The results lay foundation of future development of a single pellet drying model where heat and mass transfer models are combined and coupled to the surrounding flow field.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} in moist porous media {{has been given}} extensive theoretical consideration. In attempting to define the problem mathematically, either one of two approaches has been followed. There is the mechanistic approach which {{is based upon the}} diffusion of vapor and the <b>capillary</b> <b>movement</b> of liquids, and there is the approach which applies the theory of the thermodynamics of irreversible processes. The latter is the more general but both approaches give rise to simultaneous equations for the steady-state flow of matter and energy. These equations contain coefficients which are measures of physical properties of the particular medium under study. In this dissertation two heat transfer coefficients are evaluated: "real" thermal conductivity and "real" thermal diffusivity. Real thermal conductivity is one of the coefficients referred to above and real thermal diffusivity is a coefficient that appears in the equations for the transient flow of heat in moist porous media. Both thermal constants are those that would be obtained if measurements could be made without the interference of moisture transfer. A large-diameter, cylindrical thermal probe was designed and used for evaluation of these real thermal constants. The probe is heated uniformly at a constant rate and as the heat is dissipated in the surrounding medium, the probe temperature is recorded as a function of time. Thermal constants are obtained by comparing a theoretical expression with the experimental data. The theoretical expression includes the probe diameter, the heat capacity per unit length of the probe, and the thermal contact "resistance" between the probe and the surrounding medium. The analysis requires evaluation of the thermal contact resistance from the experimental data and independent determination of the volumetric heat capacity of the surrounding medium. Thermal constants close to real values but which include effects of distillation are obtained from the initial portion of the experimental record. These are then corrected for distillation by subtracting out a small quantity which can be evaluated theoretically. Values of real thermal conductivity and diffusivity were obtained at different moisture contents for 20 / 30 mesh Ottawa sand and for a sandy loam soil. Real thermal conductivity of the Ottawa sand (with a dry bulk density of approximately 1, 7 gms/cm³) increases rapidly from a value of 0. 000870 cal/°C/cm/sec when dry to 0. 00 Lt 4 cal/°C/cm/sec at about 15 % of saturation. Thereafter it apparently increases at a rate equal to the rate of increase of the volumetric heat capacity of the sand-water system to a value of 0. 00755 cal/°C/cm/sec at saturation. Real thermal diffusivity of this material increases from 0. 00275 cm²/sec when dry to 0, 012 cm²/sec at about 15 % of saturation. It remains nearly constant with further increase in water content. In a similar manner, real thermal conductivity of the sandy loam soil (with a dry bulk density of approximately 1. 5 gms/cm³) increases rapidly from a value of 0, 000605 cal/°C/cm/sec when dry to 0. 0036 cal/°C/cm/sec at about 30 % of saturation. It then increases at a rate approximately equal to the rate of increase of the volumetric heat capacity of the soil-water system to 0. 00595 cal/°C/cm/ sec at saturation. Real thermal diffusivity for this material increases from 0. 00223 cm²/sec when dry to 0. 0090 cm²/sec at about 30 % of saturation. Thereafter it remains essentially constant with further increase in water content. Thus, a single measurement of thermal diffusivity in the saturated sand and soil is sufficient to define real thermal diffusivity over a wide range of moisture contents...|$|E
40|$|In Part 1 of this thesis, {{reclaimed}} {{cement concrete}} (commonly {{referred to as}} recycled concrete aggregate or RCA) and reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) are investigated as potential alternative construction materials for Granular B Type II subbase fill. Ontario Provincial Standard Specification (OPSS) 1010 currently allows the common use of processed reclaimed construction materials {{in a variety of}} road base, subbase and asphaltic concrete layers, with the notable exception of Granular B Type II, which at present may only include 100 % crushed bedrock, talus, iron blast furnace slag or nickel slag. As more restrictions are placed on zoning and approvals for new natural aggregate extraction sites in Ontario, {{there is a need to}} better understand the performance of materials such as RCA and RAP as economically beneficial potential aggregate sources for granular base and subbase fill layers. An experimental program was created to assess and analyze the performance characteristics of a series of different subbase test mixtures incorporating RCA and/or RAP, either pure or blended with crushed bedrock, and the impact of the inclusion of these materials when compared to a conventional 100 % crushed bedrock test mix meeting OPSS 1010 requirements for Granular B Type II. The performance characteristics to be assessed were field compactibility, gradations before and after field compaction, physical properties, standard and modified Proctor tests, California Bearing Ratio (CBR), permeability, resilient moduli and lightweight deflectometer (LWD) resilient moduli. Field testing programs conducted at Quarry 1 in Ottawa, Ontario and Quarry 2 in Burlington, Ontario indicate that the subbase test mixtures meeting OPSS Granular B Type II gradation requirements and incorporating different proportions of crushed rock, RCA and/or RAP exhibit similar field rolling compactibility relative to 100 % crushed rock. Grain size analysis testing showed some aggregate breakdown in multiple test mixes, with only minimal increases in material passing the 75 µm sieve, which is crucial to preserving permeability and drainage characteristics. Tests using a lightweight deflectometer (LWD) were subject to substantial variability but indicated that mixes using elevated levels of RCA (50 % and 100 %) can potentially have lower in-situ moduli compared to the other blends tested. Laboratory tests indicate that high replacement levels of RCA can be used in subbase materials as a substitute for 100 % crushed rock while maintaining good water permeability characteristics and similar or higher resilient moduli in blends incorporating RCA and/or RAP. CBR testing results were similar across all test blends incorporating crushed rock and RCA, but also indicated that the inclusion of 30 % RAP can potentially reduce the bearing capacity of the granular material by approximately 30 - 40 % in comparison to all other blends which do not contain RAP. Based on the overall results of this study, RCA and RAP appear to be capable of successfully substituting for natural aggregates in Granular B Type II in a range of compositional proportions. It is recommended that test sections should be completed on highway contracts with subbase mixture blends incorporating RCA and/or RAP in order to verify their performance in pavement structures in the field. In Part 2 of this thesis, foam glass lightweight aggregates (LWA) are investigated as a potential pavement engineering design alternative in order to mitigate roadway loading impacts upon underlying subgrade soils while promoting the sustainable and economical use of recycled waste glass. Foamyna Canada Inc. supplied the Centre for Pavement and Transportation Technology (CPATT) with two foam glass lightweight aggregate materials, designated in this thesis as LWA-A and LWA-B. Physical properties testing was carried out by CPATT, including grain size analysis, crushed particle content, flat and elongated particle content, Micro-Deval abrasion resistance, cyclic freezing-and-thawing resistance and resilient modulus testing procedures. These procedures were conducted in order to evaluate the LWA materials against locally applicable standards, namely Ontario Provincial Standard Specification document OPSS 1010 as currently used by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO). The laboratory testing detailed in Part 2 indicates that both LWA-A and LWA-B have a very consistent and repeatable gradation with a high percentage of coarse aggregates. Both foam glass materials have very high crushed particle contents and very low flat and elongated particle contents. Micro-Deval abrasion resistance, freeze-and-thaw resistance and resilient moduli were also excellent for both materials, while relative density testing indicated LWA material specific gravity values which were substantially lower than that of water. However, it was found that the gradations of these two tested materials do not satisfy the existing requirements of OPSS 1010, which were developed for natural aggregates and, as currently constituted, may not be appropriately adapted to artificial lightweight aggregates. The coarse nature of the LWA materials would be highly beneficial to ensure the stability of the granular layers and prevent upward <b>capillary</b> water <b>movement</b> into other layers of the pavement structure. Pavement design calculations were carried out using the AASHTO 1993 empirical design procedure and found that utilizing foam glass LWA as a lightweight subgrade replacement fill material can result in substantially leaner pavement structures as compared to the use of conventional expanded polystyrene (EPS) geofoam blocks as an artificial subgrade. A life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) procedure carried out on these pavement designs showed that the use of foam glass LWA as a lightweight fill material underlying pavement can result in overall cost savings of over 30 percent relative to pavement structures which are underlain by EPS geofoam. Overall, the two tested LWA materials showed excellent physical and mechanical characteristics, and would be suitable for use in pavement structures as innovative lightweight and environmentally friendly alternatives to natural aggregate materials...|$|R
40|$|Electrochemically {{assisted}} injection (EAI) is a hydrodynamic injection concept {{applied for}} CE/MS that enables an electrochemical analyte conversion at a substrate electrode during the injection process. The electrochemical formation of charged species from neutral ones enables an electrophoretic separation in aqueous and non-aqueous media. In some cases, a significant enhancement of electrospray ionization efficiency in mass spectrometry can be achieved. The {{first part of}} the present thesis covers the development and characterization of novel automated injection arrangements for EAI/CE/MS. The stepwise development started with the fabrication of amperometric capillary probes to investigate the dependency of the capillary-to-substrate electrode distance on the injection efficiency. An electrochemical characterization of the capillary probes was carried out with the help of hydrodynamic voltammetry. Probe approach curves were recorded using a scanning electrochemical microscope for the vertical alignment of capillary-based probes over a substrate electrode. The SECM allowed a vertical fine-positioning with a resolution in the micrometer range. In this context the SECM bipotentiostat was exploited for amperometric detection. Probe approach curves turned out that the current response remained nearly constant for distances between 5 µm and 60 µm and decreased significantly for larger distances. In a further development step a semiautomated injection cell was constructed considering the required accuracy in capillary positioning. A fast and precise piezo motor was chosen for vertical <b>capillary</b> <b>movement</b> over a substrate electrode. Commercially available screen-printed electrodes served as substrate electrodes. A CE buffer reservoir was incorporated next to the substrate electrode holding compartment. The change between injection mode and separation mode was carried out manually by moving the arrangement to the relevant position. The device was hyphenated to a home-built CE/MS system and characterized regarding precision and reproducibility using ferrocene methanol as a model system. Based on the EAI/CE/MS results obtained with the semiautomated cell, a fully automated EAI cell was developed to enhance the precision of the whole EAI injection process. In contrast to the semiautomated cell, the latest version enabled a fully automated, microprocessor-controlled injection. Two servo motors were responsible for the vertical capillary alignment and the automated change between injection and separation mode. The motion sequence of the servo motors was programmed and triggered either by computer software or a handheld controller unit. The injection cell was characterized {{in the same way as}} the semiautomated cell. The fully automated cell was applied for all further EAI/CE/MS experiments. In the second part of the present thesis, the investigation of screen-printed electrodes in the context of EAI/CE/MS studies of nitroaromatic compounds is described. Screen-printed electrodes consist of a concentric arrangement of three electrodes on a suitable glass or ceramic substrate. They are easy to prepare and modify and a wide range of electrode materials is commercially available. Additionally, sample volumes in the microliter range are sufficient to cover the electrode structures. In the present studies it is focused on carbon-based SPEs. The materials of choice were carbon, carbon nanofibers and reduced graphene oxide. A protocol for the drop coating modification of uc SPEs using reduced graphene oxide was developed. The electrode materials were compared as they were used for mass voltammetric EAI/CE/MS studies of the electrochemical reduction of 4 -nitrotoluene under acidic conditions. It was demonstrated that the reduction products 4 -hydroxyl-aminotoluene and 4 -aminotoluene, are formed at rather negative potentials at reduced graphene oxide electrodes, compared to carbon and carbon nanofiber electrodes. Moreover, the relative abundance of both species formed varied for different electrode materials. In further experiments, isotopically labeled 4 -nitrotoluene-d 4 served as an internal standard to investigate the electrodes’ liability regarding electrode fouling, a well-known problem when working with solid state electrodes. Both mass voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry turned out that neither 4 -nitrotoluene nor its reduction products tended to adsorb at the electrode surface. Finally, 4 -Nitrotoluene-d 4 was exploited as an internal standard for the quantification of 4 -Nitrotoluene in soil and drinking water samples. A liquid-solid extraction protocol was developed for soil samples. In the case of drinking water samples, a solid-phase extraction protocol using a C- 18 stationary phase was developed. The samples were spiked with a defined amount of 4 -nitrotoluene and the internal standard was added. The ratio of the peak intensities recorded in the mass traces of the reduced amine species allowed for the calculation of method recovery values. In conclusion EAI/CE/MS is a powerful technique that combines the high sensitivity and selectivity of mass spectrometry with capillary electrophoresis. The key point of this work is the electrochemically assisted injection prior to CE/MS measurements. EAI allows CE/MS measurements of commonly inapplicable analytes due to an electrochemical conversion during the injection process. EAI enables the separation of neutral analytes by an electrochemical generation of charged species and, additionally, enhances the electrospray ionization efficiency. It was demonstrated that EAI/CE/MS can be applied for various quantitative and mechanistic studies that are presented in this Ph. D. thesis. ...|$|E
