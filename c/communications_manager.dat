50|$|As the {{locomotive}} proceeds down the track, the on-board systems communicate via radio to the trackside BCMs in the region, requesting any temporary speed restrictions {{for the next}} three or more regions of the track, ensuring that {{the locomotive}}'s database is always kept current with any possible temporary restrictions issued by the train dispatcher. Wayside <b>Communications</b> <b>Managers</b> (WCM) (or packet switches) link all the BCMs in the region to a backhaul network which allows them to communicate with the dispatcher's office and associated control systems via TCP/IP.
