40|$|When {{synthetic}} aperture radar systems are pushed to attain finer resolution at larger ranges than was previously the case for remote sensing purposes, the geometric signal aberration known as range curvature arises. Known techniques for <b>correcting</b> <b>range</b> curvature are exact at only one selected range, thus forcing neighboring ranges {{to use the same}} correction as an approximation. A solution to the problem is proposed that is exact at all ranges, thus simplifying and improving the image processing for such systems...|$|E
30|$|In this work, {{a method}} for {{registration}} of color and range images was presented. We showed that the proposed method is practical, accurate, and widely applicable. Firstly, the problem of registering two close-positioned cameras and the underlying nonlinearity was studied in this paper. Following, an itemized outline of our method was given {{as well as a}} mathematical description of the nonlinear basis function. Furthermore, we presented a computational approach that preserves efficiency and accuracy regardless of the underlying mathematical model. This leads our method to be useful in <b>correcting</b> <b>range</b> camera distortion, a problem that remains challenging.|$|E
40|$|The use of pulse {{compression}} techniques {{to improve the}} sensitivity of meteorological radars has become increasingly common in recent years. An unavoidable side-effect of such techniques is the formation of ‘range sidelobes’ which lead to spreading of information across several range gates. These artefacts are particularly troublesome in regions {{where there is a}} sharp gradient in the power backscattered to the antenna as a function of range. In this article we present a simple method for identifying and <b>correcting</b> <b>range</b> sidelobe artefacts. We make use of the fact that meteorological targets produce an echo which fluctuates at random, and that this echo, like a fingerprint, is unique to each range gate. By cross-correlating the echo time series from pairs of gates therefore we can identify whether information from one gate has spread into another, and hence flag regions of contamination. In addition we show that the correlation coefficients contain quantitative information about the fraction of power leaked from one range gate to another, and we propose a simple algorithm to correct the corrupted reflectivity profile...|$|E

5000|$|In practice, ranges {{were not}} sent by {{voice to the}} aircraft. Instead, a tone {{generator}} produced Morse code dots or dashes {{under the control of}} the operators. This was similar to the beam systems like Lorenz, which the UK aircrew were already familiar with using as a blind landing aid in the pre-war period. If the aircraft was too close to the station the operator would play the dot signal, and when they were too far, dashes. The two could be mixed so that as they approached the <b>correct</b> <b>range,</b> the signal would slowly turn into a steady tone. Periodically the signal would be keyed to send out a letter to indicate how far they were from the <b>correct</b> <b>range,</b> X indicating , Y , and Z [...] Likewise the Mouse station sent a series of keyed signals to indicate the approach, S to indicate the approach was starting, and then A, B, C and D as the aircraft approached.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The human {{sensorimotor}} {{system is}} thought to attenuate the perception of self-generated forces, which causes people to generate a larger force so the perception of their exerted force matches their intention [1]. The {{purpose of this study}} is to understand the nature of force attenuation, to determine if the natural tendency to underestimate self-generated forces can be retrained, and to ascertain if humans can learn to more accurately recreate forces. To test this hypothesis, forces were applied to one hand and each participant was asked to recreate those forces on his/her other hand. The back and forth force exchange generated the expected force escalation in individuals. Participants were then given feedback about the accuracy of their recreated forces during a training phase. Before training, no participants had their average force in the <b>correct</b> <b>range,</b> but 86 % of participants had their average force in the <b>correct</b> <b>range</b> when tested the following day. The participants also increased the consistency of their force recreation after training.
