5|$|The {{depression}} produced waves up to 3ft (0.9m) around Anna Maria Island, {{where two}} people died of fatigue-related heart attacks after {{being caught in}} a rip current. Heavy rainfall in the New Orleans, Louisiana and Mobile, Alabama areas—aided by instability from {{the remnants of the}} depression—flooded streets, inundating an apartment complex in the former city and cutting power to 1,921 <b>customers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> latter city. Forty homes and businesses were flooded in Avoyelles Parish. Rainfall accumulations peaked south of Natchez, Mississippi, where 13.9in (353mm) was documented.|$|E

5|$|Georg Emil Hansen (1833–1891) from Næstved {{came from}} a family of photographers. When his father, Carl Christian Hansen, opened a studio in Copenhagen, he decided to open one of his own. He {{became one of the most}} {{respected}} photographers of his day, with Christian IX of Denmark and the Danish Royal Family as <b>customers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1860s. He also excelled in adopting new techniques. He was the first to use paper prints and to make full-length portrait enlargements. He received awards for his exhibitions in London (1862) and Berlin (1865). In 1867, together with his brother, Niels Christian Hansen, and two other photographers, he set up a photographic firm which later became Hansen, Schou & Weller, suppliers to the royal Danish court.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Humberto left 10homes {{completely}} destroyed in Galveston County, {{with an additional}} 19 severely damaged in the county; several homes received minor shingle damage, and road closures left about 5,000houses isolated in the county. The combination of saturated grounds and strong winds uprooted many trees and downed power lines across {{the path of the}} hurricane, with at least 50high voltage transmission poles blown down or seriously damaged; over 120,000power customers in Orange and Jefferson counties lost power, with 118,000Entergy <b>customers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state without electricity. Widespread flooding occurred in Jefferson and Orange counties, and at least 20homes in Beaumont were flooded. Additionally, several roadways were flooded. The passage of the hurricane caused one fatality in the state; a Bridge City man was killed when his carport crashed on him outside his house. Initially, press reports indicated that the storm wrought up to $500million in damage; however, final damage estimates were about $50million.|$|E
5|$|Residents in both Massachusetts and Connecticut {{were also}} without power {{for up to}} one week, which caused many food {{products}} to spoil {{due to lack of}} refrigeration. The states brought in workers from other states, although the delay in restoring the widespread outages caused many schools to remain closed. In Connecticut, one man was electrocuted while repairing downed power lines. About 477,000 Connecticut Light & Power <b>customers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state lost power, a record that was surpassed by the 754,000 who lost power during Hurricane Irene in 2011. Later in 2011, a nor'easter in October left over 830,000people statewide without power, also breaking the record set by Gloria. In New Hampshire, most power outages were quickly restored, and all were restored within six days. In Maine, all power outages were restored in 11days.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} Florida {{received}} a federal Major Disaster Declaration on September 12. Franklin, Levy, Manatee, and Pinellas counties—where the storm left 5,000 individuals without work—became eligible for federal aid after President Ronald Reagan visited {{the state and}} determined that residents in those areas would benefit from assistance such as temporary housing, low-interest loans for rebuilding efforts, and monetary grants. Disaster centers were opened in those four counties as centralized locations for federal, state, and volunteer agencies to operate relief programs. President Reagan later included Hillsborough, Wakulla, and Dixie counties, bringing {{the total number of}} Florida counties eligible for federal aid to seven. The deadline for residents of all seven counties to apply for either state or federal assistance was set for November 12. Several major corporations—including Texaco, Exxon, and J.C. Penney—contacted <b>customers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> affected areas and offered to make special arrangements for their monthly payments if they had been financially affected by the storm. While {{only a small number of}} customers took advantage of the assistance, the companies' actions were met with highly positive feedback.|$|E

5|$|While {{harmonics}} in the PWM output {{can easily}} be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load, the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC voltage output by super-imposing non-linear half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the AC grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can {{have a negative impact on}} the AC power waveform available to other power company <b>customers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same grid.|$|E
