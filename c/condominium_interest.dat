50|$|Originally the CUNY School of Law at Queens College {{located in}} Flushing, Queens, it moved to 2 Court Square in Long Island City {{at the end}} of May 2012. CUNY {{purchased}} a six-floor <b>condominium</b> <b>interest</b> in the 14-story environmentally green building. Citigroup will retain ownership of the remainder of the building. The move gave the school nearly 70,000 additional square feet of space. The building is within walking distance of seven subway lines (two within one stop of Manhattan), the Long Island Railroad, and eight bus lines. It is only a few blocks away from the Long Island City Courthouse. The move will enable CUNY School of Law to develop a new part-time program, though it has yet to be announced when this program will start. The building at 2 Court Square is LEED Gold certified, which means that its construction had a reduced environmental impact and its design increases occupants' health and well-being.|$|E
5000|$|... 1095 Avenue Of The Americas is a 630 ft (192m) tall {{skyscraper}} in New York City, New York. It {{was constructed}} from 1972 to 1974 as headquarters of New York Telephone and has 41 floors. The building {{also served as}} the headquarters of NYNEX and Bell Atlantic. Kahn & Jacobs designed the building, which is the 61st tallest in New York. The original facade {{was said to be}} designed to resemble the relays which were commonly found inside telephones of the time. From 2006 to 2007 the tower received a $260 million renovation which upgraded the office space from Class B+ to Class A office space. The phone company moved its headquarters to the Verizon Building in the early 2000s, and sold off most of the building, retaining a <b>condominium</b> <b>interest</b> in floors 6-12, where Verizon maintained offices and a telephone exchange serving landlines in Midtown Manhattan. However, in 2013 the company moved its corporate headquarters back to 1095 Avenue of the Americas, following a sale of the upper floors of the Verizon Building.|$|E
40|$|Ever more Americans live in {{a common}} {{interest}} community such as a homeowners’ association or <b>condominium.</b> Common <b>interest</b> communities restrict the uses owners may make of their property but provide benefits to the owners. The community association pays for these benefits by levying assessments on the owners’ property. Common interest communities offer {{a wide variety of}} benefits that can be divided into two sorts: public and private. Local municipalities typically provide public benefits at taxpayer expense; private entities usually afford private benefits at the consumer’s expense. Like both public and private entities, common interest communities can experience the problem of financial distress. The ultimate solution to financial distress is relief under the Bankruptcy Code. Private entities are eligible for relief under chapter 11; public entities—municipalities—are eligible for relief under chapter 9. Chapter 9 affords municipalities significant protections compared to private entities under chapter 11 because of the irreducible political sovereignty of municipalities. Nonetheless, even though common interest communities also provide public goods, they are eligible for relief only under chapter 11 and thus lack the protections afforded by chapter 9. Chapter 11 of the Code should be amended in two ways to afford common interest communities some of the benefits of chapter 9. Specifically: (1) the standard of the best interests of creditors in a proposed chapter 11 plan of reorganization should not be evaluated against a hypothetical chapter 7 liquidation; and (2) a common interest community should be able to cram down its plan without regard to retention by the community of its assets. Without these amendments, common interest communities in financial distress and their members will be less likely to reorganize, and the cost of providing public goods will revert to the local community and its taxpayers...|$|R
