During a period of National Service from 1948-50 Simmons was posted to the Suez Canal Zone, Egypt where his observations of birds provided material for later published work. From 1947 onwards he published many notes and papers on birds. He became particularly interested in the taxonomic implications of certain simple behaviour patterns and in bird taxonomy generally and was listed in the 1961 Directory of Zoological Taxonomists.

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} how individuals who have <b>completed</b> <b>professional</b> <b>training</b> continue to learn within their organizations. We have tried to analyze the mechanisms at work when a professional returns to the workplace and hypothesized that a multilevel analysis including the individual, the group and the organization would enable us to gain an overall view of the entire process. Methodology: For this, we have correlated organizational theories and a theory taken from education sciences in order to understand the role of cooperation in the individual learning process. We held 14 clarification interviews with professionals who had taken training courses concerning the disabled. Results: The results showed us that the group and work organization are key factors in the process leading to the recognition of individuals’ professionality. Conclusions: We thus plan to demonstrate that the effectiveness of training also depends on the organizational context in which learning is pursued.
