2500|$|One {{observation}} {{is that while}} current [...] "best practice" [...] heat pumps (ground source system, operating between 0°C and 35°C) have a typical COP around 4, no better than 5, the maximum achievable is 8.8 because of fundamental Carnot cycle limits. This means that in the coming decades, the energy efficiency of top-end heat pumps could roughly double. Cranking up efficiency requires {{the development of a}} better gas <b>compressor,</b> <b>fitting</b> HVAC machines with larger heat exchangers with slower gas flows, and solving internal lubrication problems resulting from slower gas flow.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{compressor}} map tuning {{method is}} developed {{with the primary}} objective of improving the accuracy and fidelity of gas turbine engine models for performance prediction and diagnostics. A new <b>compressor</b> map <b>fitting</b> and modeling method is introduced to simultaneously determine the best elliptical curves {{to a set of}} compressor map data. The coefficients that determine the shape of the compressor map curves are analyzed and tuned through a multi-objective optimization scheme in order to simultaneously match multiple sets of engine performance measurements. The component map tuning method, that is developed in the object oriented Matlab Simulink environment, is implemented in a dynamic gas turbine engine model and tested in off-design steady state and transient as well as degraded operating conditions. The results provided demonstrate and illustrate the capabilities of our proposed method in refining existing engine performance models to different modes of the gas turbine operation. In addition, the excellent agreement between the injected and the predicted degradation of the engine model demonstrates the potential of the proposed methodology for gas turbine diagnostics. The proposed method can be integrated with the performance-based tools for improved condition monitoring and diagnostics of gas turbine power plants. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The Swedish {{industry}} uses {{large volumes}} of compressed air. The compressed air process isenergy intensive and creates large amounts of excess heat. It is therefore important to utilizethe excess heat, optimize {{the operation of the}} compressors and to have a regular maintenanceon the system. This thesis is a pre-study to make a compressed air system energy efficient andis done in collaboration with Ljunghäll AB. Ljunghäll AB is one of Northern Europe's leadingdie casting companies and are located in Södra Vi, Sweden. The purpose is to describe andmap the compressed air system in the old part of the facility in Södra Vi. The thesis will alsogive an explanation of how Ljunghäll AB can improve the compressed air system. Providethem suggestions for energy savings and lower the environmental impact of production. Theobjective of the thesis is to create an understanding of how improvements in the compressedair system can be done by studying the operation, compressor, pipe system and leak detecting. The economic aspects of the solutions together with the effect of noise and engine operationof the compressors have not been taken into consideration. To reach improvement measures avisit to the facility in Södra Vi was made, where measuring and mapping was executed andthen compared with earlier studies and literature. The conclusions of the thesis show thatLjunghäll AB has a good operation and control of the compressors, through the variable speeddrive and steering system. It also showed that the choice of the existing compressors are goodfor their compressed air usage. The study also resulted in the following suggestions for theenergy efficiency and lowering of the environmental impact of production at Ljunghäll AB’scompressed air system: Water heat recovery, replacement of old pipes, cover the leakage,regular maintenance of <b>compressors</b> and <b>fittings,</b> training in compressed air for workers,centralized compressor central and sectioning of the pipe system...|$|R
40|$|Improving efficiency, {{reliability}} and availability of gas turbines have become more than ever {{one of the main}} areas of interest in gas turbine research. This is mainly due to the stringent environmental regulations that have to be met in such a mature technology sector; and consequently new research challenges have been identified. One of these involves the establishment of high fidelity, accurate, and computationally efficient engine performance simulation, diagnosis and prognosis technology. Performance prediction of gas turbines is strongly dependent on detailed understanding of the engine component behaviour. Compressors are of special interest because they can generate all sorts of operability problems like surge, stall and flutter; and their operating line is determined by the turbine characteristic. Compressor performance maps, which are obtained in costly rig tests and remain manufacturers proprietary information, impose a stringent limitation that has been commonly resolved by scaling default generic maps in order to match the targeted off-design or engine degraded measurements. This approach is efficient in small range of operating conditions but becomes less accurate for a wider range of operations. In this paper, a novel compressor map generation method, with the primary objective of improving the accuracy and fidelity of the engine model performance prediction is developed and presented. A new <b>compressor</b> map <b>fitting</b> and modelling method is introduced to simultaneously determine the best elliptical curves to a set of compressor map data. The coefficients that determine the shape of compressor maps' curves have been analyzed and tuned through a multi-objective optimization algorithm {{in order to meet the}} targeted set of measurements. The proposed component map generation method is developed in the object oriented Matlab/Simulink environment and is integrated in a dynamic gas turbine engine model. The accuracy of this method is evaluated for off-design steady state and transient engine conditions. The proposed compressor map generation method has the capability to refine current gas turbine performance prediction approaches and to improve model-based diagnostic techniques.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the initial experimental {{results of a}} long term programme, the ultimate aim {{of which is to}} be able to produce software for the design of twin screw compressors and expanders in which full account is taken of 3 -D flow and fluid-solid interactive effects on performance. Software for this purpose, based on CFD methods has already been developed but requires reliable measurements of velocity and pressure fields within the machine, throughout its operating cycle, in order to be validated. Hitherto, no record of any such measurements has been reported. Measurements of the phase-averaged mean velocity components and the corresponding turbulence fluctuations within the compressor working chamber will therefore be evaluated by means of Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV), at various cross sections, including inlet and exit, under both steady and transient flow conditions. A standard air compressor test rig has been adapted for this purpose and fitted with an oil injected screw <b>compressor,</b> modified by <b>fitting</b> it with a transparent window near the discharge port to allow the application of various laser measuring techniques. As the initial phase of the measurements, the axial mean and root mean square velocities were measured in the compressor inside the compression chamber at rotational speeds of up to 1, 000 rpm. The results so far, have confirmed the usefulness of the LDV technique as a means of measuring the flow inside the compressor working chamber and showed that an angular resolution of 2 is small enough to fully describe the flow inside the chamber. It was also found that flow variation between successive working chambers within the male rotor was small and that the variation of the axial mean velocity and turbulence velocity fluctuation within the working chamber could be identified...|$|R
