Anal secretions are produced in the hindgut, and released along the posterior setae as predator deterrents In Australia, aggregations of male common blossom thrips have been observed on the petals of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis and Gossypium hirsutum; females were attracted to these groups so {{it seems likely that the}} males were producing pheromones.|$|E
5|$|Urinary {{proteins}} {{were first}} reported in rodents in 1932, during studies by Thomas Addis into {{the cause of}} proteinuria. They are potent human allergens, and are largely responsible {{for a number of}} animal allergies, including to cats, horses and rodents. Their endogenous function within an animal is unknown, but may involve regulating energy expenditure. However, as secreted proteins they play multiple roles in <b>chemical</b> <b>communication</b> between animals, functioning as pheromone transporters and stabilizers in rodents and pigs. Mups can also act as protein pheromones themselves. They have been demonstrated to promote aggression in male mice, and one specific Mup protein found in male mouse urine is sexually attractive to female mice. Mups can also function as signals between different species: mice display an instinctive fear response on the detection of Mups derived from predators such as cats and rats.|$|E

Mucous glands cover the entire surface area of the amphibian body and specialize in keeping the body lubricated.

For example, a rutting male may dilate its preorbital glands in order to signal aggression to another nearby male. Female deer often open their glands while caring for their young.|$|E
25|$|Harvester ant populations operate {{without a}} {{centralized}} control system {{by means of a}} decentralized <b>chemical</b> <b>communication</b> system, through the process of chemical signalling. Foraging is regulated using positive and negative feedback loops. Ants returning to the colony stimulates outgoing foraging. When ants return to the colony at a higher rate with seeds, this in turn causes the outgoing rate of foragers to increase. As fewer ants bearing seeds return to the colony, the rate of outgoing foragers decreases. The result is foraging regulation relative to the abundance of available food at any given time. The interactions between returning and outgoing foragers operates on a timescale of seconds. It typically only took three to eight seconds for an outgoing forager to leave the nest {{as a result of an}} increase in successful returning foragers.|$|E

2500|$|Red {{imported}} {{fire ants}} can distinguish nestmates and non-nestmates through <b>chemical</b> <b>communication</b> and specific colony odours. Workers prefer {{to dig into}} nest materials from their own colony and not from soil in unnested areas or from other red imported fire ant colonies. One study suggests that as a colony's diet is similar, {{the only difference between}} nested and unnested soil was the nesting of the ants themselves. Therefore, [...] workers may transfer colony odour within the soil. Colony odour can be affected by the environment, as workers in lab-reared colonies are less aggressive than those in the wild. Queen-derived cues are able to regulate nestmate recognition in workers and amine levels. However, these cues do not {{play a major role in}} colony-level recognition, but they can serve as a form of caste-recognition within nests. Workers living in monogyne societies tend to be extremely aggressive and attack intruders from neighbouring nests. In queenless colonies, the addition of alien queens or workers does not increase aggression among the population.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{being the}} oldest method of communication, <b>chemical</b> <b>communication</b> {{is one of}} the least {{understood}} forms {{due in part to the}} sheer abundance of chemicals in our environment and the difficulty of detecting and measuring all the chemicals in a sample. [...] The ability to detect chemicals in the environment serves many functions, a crucial one being the detection of food, a function that first arose in single-celled organisms (bacteria) living in the oceans during the early days of life on Earth. As this function evolved, organisms began to differentiate between chemicals compounds emanating from resources, conspecifics (same species; i.e., mates and kin), and heterospecifics (different species; i.e., competitors and predators). [...] For instance, a small minnow species may do well to avoid habitat with a detectable concentration of chemical cue associated with a predator species such as northern pike. Minnows with the ability to perceive the presence of predators before they are close enough to be seen and then respond with adaptive behaviour (such as hiding) are more likely to survive and reproduce. Scent marking is a common form of olfactory communication in mammals.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, Steve Shattuck {{and colleagues}} {{proposed}} conserving the name S. invicta. Since the first description of S. invicta, over 1,800 scientific papers {{using the name}} were published discussing {{a wide range of}} topics about its ecological behaviour, genetics, <b>chemical</b> <b>communication,</b> economic impacts, methods of control, population, and physiology. They state that the use of S. wagneri is a [...] "threat" [...] to nomenclatural stability towards scientists and non-scientists; taxonomists may have been able to adapt to such name change, but name confusion may arise if such case occurred. Due to this, Shattuck and his colleagues proposed the continued use of S. invicta and not S. wagneri, as this name has been rarely used; between 1995 and 1998, over 100 papers were published using S. invicta and only three using S. wagneri. They requested that the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) use plenary powers to suppress S. wagneri for the purpose of the Principle of Priority and not for the Principle of Homonymy. Furthermore, they requested that the name S. invicta be added to the Official List of Specific Names in Zoology and that S. wagneri be added to the Official Index of Rejected Invalid Specific Names in Zoology. Upon review, the proposal was voted on by the entomological community and was supported by all but one voter. They note that there is no justification in suppressing S. wagneri; instead, {{it would be better to}} give precedence to S. invicta over S. wagneri whenever an author treated them as conspecific. The ICZN would conserve S. invicta and suppress S. wagneri in a 2001 review. Under the present classification, the red imported fire ant is a member of the genus Solenopsis in the tribe Solenopsidini, subfamily Myrmicinae. It is a member of the family Formicidae, belonging to the order Hymenoptera, an order of insects containing ants, bees, and wasps.|$|E

50|$|One unique {{aspect of}} <b>chemical</b> <b>communication</b> that differentiates it from other modes is that lizards {{do not need}} to come into direct contact in order to {{communicate}} using chemicals. Once a chemical has been released onto a surface, it can be used in communication until it is washed away or otherwise removed. Lizards may come into contact with chemicals that were placed there by a lizard hours or even days before, depending on how long the chemical lasts in the environment. Thus, lizards that live at relatively low population densities or do not come into close contact very often can use <b>chemical</b> <b>communication.</b> Because lizards that use <b>chemical</b> <b>communication</b> rely on these chemicals remaining in the environment for some amount of time, <b>chemical</b> <b>communication</b> is usually better suited for use in dry environments.

The foragers of pleometrotic nests {{were found to}} be the least aggressive individuals of a given colony. It has also been observed that the females with the least developed ovaries were the ones that did the most foraging in a given colony. In addition, it has been hypothesized that as M. mexicanus cubicola individuals age, they accumulate a specific odor, which aligns with the observation that older female wasps are usually rejected from foreign nests. It has also been found that male individuals of this species have exocrine gland cells in their gastral sternites, which supports the idea the M. m. cubicola uses <b>chemicals</b> for <b>communication</b> such as nest-mate recognition and pheromone signaling.|$|R
30|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, complex {{mathematical}} modelling with higher order is frequently encountered in many engineering applications, which may cause nonlinearity in dynamic systems.
