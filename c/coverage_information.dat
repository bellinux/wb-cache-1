40|$|Abstract. Coverage {{is a very}} {{important}} issue in wireless sensor networks. Current literature defines a point to be covered if it is within the sensing radius of at least one sensor. This is a conservative definition of coverage and we have previously proposed a new notion of <b>information</b> <b>coverage.</b> Compared with the conventional definition of coverage, a point can still be information covered even if it is not within the sensing disk of any sensor. The density requirements for complete <b>information</b> <b>coverage</b> of a field are analyzed and simulated for a random sensor deployment.

50|$|To store matte information, {{the concept}} of an alpha channel was {{introduced}} by Alvy Ray Smith in the late 1970s, and fully developed in a 1984 paper by Thomas Porter and Tom Duff. In a 2D image element, which stores a color for each pixel, additional data is stored in the alpha channel with a value between 0 and 1. A value of 0 means that the pixel does not have any <b>coverage</b> <b>information</b> and is transparent; i.e. there was no color contribution from any geometry because the geometry did not overlap this pixel. A value of 1 means that the pixel is opaque because the geometry completely overlapped the pixel.|$|E
50|$|Software {{written in}} {{accordance}} with IEC 61508 {{may need to be}} unit tested, depending up on the SIL level it needs to achieve. The main requirement in Unit Testing is to ensure that the software is fully tested at the function level and that all possible branches and paths are taken through the software. In some higher SIL level applications, the software code coverage requirement is much tougher and an MCDC code coverage criterion is used rather than simple branch coverage. To obtain the MCDC (modified condition decision coverage) <b>coverage</b> <b>information,</b> one will need a Unit Testing tool, sometimes referred to as a Software Module Testing tool.|$|E

50|$|The {{idea of a}} Submodular set {{function}} {{has recently}} emerged as a powerful modeling tool for various summarization problems. Submodular functions naturally model notions of <b>coverage,</b> <b>information,</b> representation and diversity. Moreover, several important combinatorial optimization problems occur as special instances of submodular optimization. For example, the set cover problem is a special case of submodular optimization, since the set cover function is submodular. The set cover function attempts to find a subset of objects which cover a given set of concepts. For example, in document summarization, one would like the summary to cover all important and relevant concepts in the document. This is an instance of set cover. Similarly, the facility location problem is a special case of submodular functions. The Facility Location function also naturally models coverage and diversity. Another example of a submodular optimization problem is using a Determinantal point process to model diversity. Similarly, the Maximum-Marginal-Relevance procedure {{can also be seen}} as an instance of submodular optimization. All these important models encouraging coverage, diversity and information are all submodular. Moreover, submodular functions can be efficiently combined together, and the resulting function is still submodular. Hence, one could combine one submodular function which models diversity, another one which models coverage and use human supervision to learn a right model of a submodular function for the problem.|$|E

40|$|Tag cloud {{has been}} a popular {{facility}} used by social sites for online resource summarization and navigation. Tag selection, which aims to select {{a limited number of}} representative tags from a large set of tags, is the core task for creating tag clouds. Diversity of tag selection result is an important factor that affects user satisfaction. <b>Information</b> <b>coverage</b> and item dissimilarity are two major perspectives for exploring the concept of diversity, while existing tag selection approaches usually consider diversification from single perspective. In this paper, we propose a new approach for diversifying tag selection result, which takes into account both <b>information</b> <b>coverage</b> and tag dissimilarity. We design two sub-objective functions about <b>information</b> <b>coverage</b> and tag dissimilarity, respectively, and construct an objective function as a convex combination of the two sub-objective ones. We also give out a greedy algorithm that can well approximate the objective function. We conduct experiments on 17 datasets extracted from the website of CiteULike to compare our approach with existing ones. The experiment results show that our approach can achieve promising performance of diversification.
