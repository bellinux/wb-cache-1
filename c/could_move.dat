5|$|Ford had 20 career fumble {{recoveries}} at {{the time}} of his retirement. Ford was successful in part because of his combination of quickness and size. Few players of his era who were as tall and big as he was <b>could</b> <b>move</b> as fast; only Larry Brink of the Rams was close to him in proportions.|$|E
5|$|Greinke was {{selected}} {{in the first round}} of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft by the Kansas City Royals, who felt he was a polished player who <b>could</b> <b>move</b> quickly through their system. Greinke turned down a scholarship offer from Clemson University to sign with the Royals for a $2.5 million signing bonus.|$|E

5|$|Since {{at least}} some of Tyrannosauruss {{potential}} prey <b>could</b> <b>move</b> quickly, evidence that it walked instead of ran could indicate that it was a scavenger. On the other hand, recent analyses suggest that Tyrannosaurus, while slower than large modern terrestrial predators, may well have been fast enough to prey on large hadrosaurs and ceratopsians.|$|E
5|$|The diagram {{shows an}} example checkmate position. The white king is {{threatened}} by the black queen; the square to which the king <b>could</b> <b>move</b> is also threatened; it cannot capture the queen, because it would then be in check by the rook.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to his own squad, {{he was killed by}} an enemy grenade. As a result of his one-man attack, Sergeant Cole's company <b>could</b> <b>move</b> forward against the fortifications and attain their ultimate objective. Sergeant Cole was initially buried in the 4th Marine Division Cemetery on Iwo Jima, but at the request of his father, his remains were returned to the United States to be buried in Parkview Cemetery, Farmington, Missouri.|$|E

5|$|Edmontosaurus {{was widely}} {{distributed}} across western North America. The distribution of Edmontosaurus fossils {{suggests that it}} preferred coasts and coastal plains. It was a herbivore that <b>could</b> <b>move</b> on both two legs and four. Because it is known from several bone beds, Edmontosaurus {{is thought to have}} lived in groups, and may have been migratory as well. The wealth of fossils has allowed researchers to study its paleobiology in detail, including its brain, how it may have fed, and its injuries and pathologies, such as evidence for tyrannosaur attacks on a few edmontosaur specimens.|$|E
5|$|Fender fielded mainly at slip. He possessed quick {{reactions}} and <b>could</b> <b>move</b> quickly to catch balls hit {{some distance from}} him. His technique was unorthodox; he crouched low when waiting for the ball with one leg stretched behind him, like a sprinter ready to begin a race. Good catching was vital in a Surrey side which possessed weak bowling, making his contributions even more important, and critics regarded {{him as one of}} the best slip fielders in England.|$|E
5|$|Integrity {{was laid}} down in September 1802 at the newly opened King's Dockyard in the colony of New South Wales. Governor Philip Gidley King ordered that {{construction}} proceed as swiftly as possible, {{in order to test}} the Dockyard's capacity. A team of two shipwrights, two apprentice shipwrights and two sawyers were assigned the task and delivered the finished cutter in thirteen months. During construction shipwright Thomas Moore tested that the hull was watertight by filling it with water from the inside, and repairing any visible leaks. Her hold also incorporated a partition that her crew <b>could</b> <b>move</b> to or away from the forecastle bulkhead to vary her cargo capacity.|$|E
50|$|The tiles for Joan Miró's ceramic mural (the Miró Wall) {{were fired}} in Gallifa {{and they were}} then transported 1200 km to the Ludwigshafen museum in Germany. They were placed four to a box so that they <b>could</b> <b>moved</b> down the {{mountain}} by mule. After that lorries and the train were used to complete the journey from Catalonia to south western Germany.|$|R

5|$|Kosovo Albanian {{refugees}} took {{to using}} bunkers as temporary shelters until aid agencies <b>could</b> <b>move</b> them into tent camps, while NATO troops stationed in Albania relocated dozens of bunkers to fortify their base at Kukës. The Kosovo Liberation Army also used them as defensive positions during the Kosovo War, {{though this was}} not without its risks; {{on at least one}} occasion bunkers along Albania's border with Kosovo were mistakenly bombed by NATO aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Lambeosaurus {{was like}} other hadrosaurids, and <b>could</b> <b>move</b> on both two legs and all fours, {{as shown by}} {{footprints}} of related animals. It had a long tail stiffened by ossified tendons that prevented it from drooping. The hands had four fingers, lacking the innermost finger of the generalized five-fingered tetrapod hand, while the second, third, and fourth fingers were bunched together and bore hooves, suggesting the animal could have used the hands for support. The fifth finger was free and {{could be used to}} manipulate objects. Each foot had only the three central toes.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Alberti {{was born}} in Buenos Aires on 28 May 1763 to Antonio Alberti and Juana Agustina Marín. He was baptized on the {{following}} 1 June at the Concepción parish; his godparents were Juan Javier Dogan and Isabel de Soria y Santa Cruz. He had three brothers, Isidoro, Manuel Silvestre and Félix, and three sisters, Casimira, Juana María and María Clotilde. The Alberti family became benefactor of the House of Spiritual Works of Buenos Aires by donating them a land plot so it <b>could</b> <b>move</b> its headquarters.|$|E

5|$|Military {{planners}} in Paris {{understood that}} the northern Rhine Valley, the south-western German territories, and Switzerland were strategically important {{for the defense of}} the Republic. The Swiss passes commanded access to northern Italy; consequently, the army that held those passes <b>could</b> <b>move</b> troops to and from northern and southern theaters quickly. The river was a formidable barrier to what the French perceived as Austrian aggression, and the state that controlled its crossings controlled the river itself. Finally, control of the Upper Danube would allow France to move its troops from Italy to the North Sea, or any point in between, offering immense strategic value.|$|E
5|$|Noted hadrosaur expert Jack Horner is {{currently}} the major advocate {{of the idea that}} Tyrannosaurus was exclusively a scavenger and did not engage in active hunting at all. Horner has presented several arguments to support the pure scavenger hypothesis. The presence of large olfactory bulbs and olfactory nerves suggests a highly developed sense of smell for sniffing out carcasses over great distances. The teeth could crush bone, and therefore could extract as much food (bone marrow) as possible from carcass remnants, usually the least nutritious parts. At least some of its potential prey <b>could</b> <b>move</b> quickly, while evidence suggests that Tyrannosaurus walked instead of ran.|$|E
5|$|They {{relieved}} {{elements of}} the Royal Naval Brigade, with the regiment taking over from the Nelson and Deal Battalions, on the right flank. One squadron occupied the front line, one squadron the support trench, and the third was the reserve. The regiment was on the left, the Auckland Mounted Rifles in the centre, and the Canterbury Mounted Rifles on the right. They spent {{the next few days}} improving the fire trenches, constructing communications trenches, and enlarging tracks so men and guns <b>could</b> <b>move</b> forward quickly. This was done under Turkish machine-gun and rifle fire.|$|E

5|$|When Jebe and Subutai {{heard of}} the Rus' movements, they began moving east, away from the Rus, which was the only {{direction}} in which they <b>could</b> <b>move.</b> However, they left a rearguard of 1,000 {{under the command of}} an officer, Hamabek, to report of the Rus movements and act as bait. Soon, Mstislav the Bold reached the river opposite the rearguard, and it became apparent that no prince had been appointed commander-in-chief. Thus, all the princes could act as they pleased. Eventually, Mstislav crossed the river under heavy arrow fire. When the Rus landed, however, the Mongol numbers were too great, and the Rus' were killed to the last man.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he signed}} a new {{contract}} with Southport, Brodie signed for their National League rivals Aldershot Town on 14 August 2015 on a one-year contract. He debuted the following day as a 58th-minute substitute in a 3–0 away defeat to Wrexham, but started the following match, a 1–1 home draw with Dover Athletic, in which he scored Aldershot's equalising goal on 36 minutes from a Jim Stevenson pass. Having scored five goals from 26 appearances, Brodie left Aldershot by mutual consent on 29 January 2016, so he <b>could</b> <b>move</b> closer to home for family reasons. A day later, he joined National League North club Stockport County and played for them on a part-time basis. Brodie scored on his debut with a close-range header in Stockport's 2–1 away defeat to Harrogate Town on 2 February 2016. He scored four goals from 13 appearances as Stockport ranked ninth in the National League North. He was released by the club in May 2016.|$|E
5|$|By 1914, {{experiments}} by physicists Ernest Rutherford, Henry Moseley, James Franck and Gustav Hertz {{had largely}} established {{the structure of}} an atom as a dense nucleus of positive charge surrounded by lower-mass electrons. In 1913, Danish physicist Niels Bohr postulated that electrons resided in quantized energy states, with their energies determined by the angular momentum of the electron's orbit about the nucleus. The electrons <b>could</b> <b>move</b> between those states, or orbits, by the emission or absorption of photons of specific frequencies. By means of these quantized orbits, he accurately explained the spectral lines of the hydrogen atom. However, Bohr's model failed {{to account for the}} relative intensities of the spectral lines and it was unsuccessful in explaining the spectra of more complex atoms.|$|E
