He also returns to the works of Karl Marx and the theorists of the Frankfurt School, especially to Erich Fromm and Herbert Marcuse. The author supports humanist and socialist traditions and makes a case for the concept of social justice in which he combines inspirations from classical Marxism, communitarianism, liberalism and critical theory.|$|E
40|$|The A. {{suggests}} a geo-cultural relocation of Bulgarian literature, within an agenda of reforming comparative literature studies. First, comparative literature should develop {{an awareness of}} the cultural worlds which, being neither metropolitan nor colonial, benefited insubstantially from the post-colonial turn in humanities. It should leave the “universalist” perspective behind and commit to a “communitarianist” perspective, trying a synthesis between Dionýz Ďurišin’s theory of interliterary communities and Pierre Bourdieu’s theory of the cultural field. In a pragmatical <b>communitarianist</b> epistemology experts affiliated to scholarly institutions belonging to, for example, the Black Sea states, should start producing expertise on the Black Sea region. This may lead to overcoming the neo-colonised status of, for example, Bulgarian scholarship vis-à-vis the international division of scholarly labour and, subsequently, to a reformed state of the collective mind of the Bulgarian cultural field. Such a geo-cultural relocation of Bulgarian literature to a hypothetic cross-Black Sea interliterary community, or at least neighbourhood, could be both a means for and a side-effect of the invoked act of emancipation...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of drug {{policy is a}} controversial and much debated issue in the political sphere. It is my view that any judicial policy has to be based in an ethical idea about the individual, and that the connection and analysis between ethical perspectives on {{the individual and the}} enforcing of laws with regards to the actions of individuals has to be a well-established one. In this paper I will start from the assumption {{that this is not the}} case when it comes to drug laws, and I will therefore review two popular ethical theories about the individual, and then argue that philosophical liberalism, rather than communitarianism, is the superior ethical theory because of the inherent problems of relativism within communitarianism. I will then review some common arguments for and against the prohibition of drugs, to see how well they will fare, in terms of being compatible with philosophical liberalism. I will then return to communitarianism to look at its most valuable critique of the liberal position, to then offer a compromise position between the two theories that is fully compatible with philosophical liberalism, but that also takes into account the most valuable objection from communitarianism. It is my hope that the solution I offer will be grounded in ethical theories about the individual, and in fact, manages to be based in philosophical liberalism while also incorporating the strongest objection from the <b>communitarianist</b> position, thereby taking the strengths offered by both theories into account...|$|E
40|$|Although {{there are}} {{different}} notions of what legal norms sets apart from social norms, all concepts of law adhere {{to the principle of}} legal equality, according to which like cases are treated alike. Law thus requires that like cases are treated in a like manner. This, in turn, requires a high compliance rate with any given regulation. Without sufficient compliance rates, it is hardly possible to speak of law. But can a high degree of compliance be realized beyond the coercive capacities of the nation-state? The sceptical formulation of Herbert Kelsen (1966 : 4) is famous: "The antagonism of freedom and coercion fundamental to social life supplies the decisive criterion. It is the criterion of law, for law is a coercive order. " This point of view is also reflected in Realism as a theory of international relations (Morgenthau 1964, Waltz 1979). For Realism, legal constraints beyond the nation-state are non-existent or, at best, very weak (e. g. Krasner 1999 on human rights). Furthermore, <b>communitarianists</b> point out that questions of law and justice can meaningfully be dealt with only in communities that share common values and ideas (Goodin 1988, Miller 1995) and are equally doubtful about the possibility for law beyond the nation-state. In this sense, it seems fair to describe the question of compliance as the Achilles" heel of international regulations (see Werksmann 1996 : xvi, Young 1999 a: Chap. 4). This paper aims to shed doubt on the scepticism of Realism and Communitarianism. As opposed to the propositions of both theoretical strands we show that law beyond the nation-state is indeed possible and that compliance can even in a horizontal setting without centralized coercive capacities and without a single underlying social identity work sufficiently well. We furthermore show some of the building blocks of a successful elicitation of compliance beyond the nation-state and discuss if and in how far the EU is different from other international institutions in realising them. For developing this argument we start by introducing our research design and case selection (section 2). Section 3 introduces our empirical results, discusses their relevance for the analysis of compliance and draws some theoretical implications. This section is followed by a discussion of the relevance of the results for the study of European integration (section 4) ...|$|R
40|$|Postmodernism {{has caught}} up {{with all of us}} in one way or another. We are all decentered to some degree. Advances in {{education}} and increased exposure to a globalized media have corroded traditions everywhere and challenged monistic worldviews and belief systems in the remotest corners of the globe. While we {{are becoming more and more}} aware of Others everywhere, we can rely less and less on those traditional values and guiding systems passed on to us from the past. Th e postmodern condition, as Jean-Francois Lyotard (1979) has argued, is one of uncertainty and of disconnection, as traditional bonds, both vertical and horizontal, are losing their strength. Th e physical, or bodily, component of this loss of traditional value systems and ways to make sense of the world is one of increased mobility. Some of us can now be everywhere, but when doing so risk being nowhere at all. Others remain stuck in their localities while being increasingly aware of their being stuck—not at least due to the international visitors they now receive. Zygmunt Bauman has described this phenomenon better than I could. He writes: “Some can now move out of the locality— any locality—at will. Others watch helplessly the sole locality they inhabit moving away from under their feet” (Bauman 1998, 15). Bauman further explains that “Being local in a globalized world is a sign of social deprivation and degradation. Th e discomforts of localized existence are compounded by the fact that with public spaces removed beyond the reaches of localized life, localities are losing their meaning-generating and meaning-negotiating capacity and are increasingly dependent on sense-giving and interpreting actions which they do not control—so much for the <b>communitarianist</b> dreams/consolations of the globalized intellectuals” (3) ...|$|E
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 21 st century, youth unemployment is paid attention to by the Swedish government and media. A grand part of the unemployed youth live at their parents´ house because of economic reasons contrary to their primary goal {{to be able to make}} their own living. It can be argued that the young unemployed´ s social citizenship is inferior to working citizens´ social citizenship. The thesis will not deal with suggestions on practical solutions, but rather seek for theoretical answers to whether the responsibility for the young people referred to should be a responsibility of the State or of the family. Communitarianism is a relatively young theory which is interesting for this thesis because it sheds light on the dichotomy individual - community. There are different strands within the communitarian debate. I will deal with conservative, liberal and leftist communitarianism. The classical leftist ideal of the <b>communitarianist</b> community includes rights and duties for the common good and is based on the assumption of people as social beings not being able or wanting to escape from the influence of her community. Liberal communitarianism, represented foremost by Will Kymlicka and Joseph Raz, is a theoretical strand coming up as a response on the (leftist) communitarianism. Also, a theory of conservative communitarianism, which´ s ideas date back to Aristotle, can be traced in the writings of Roger Scruton. Conclusions reached are, simplified, as follows: Conservative communitarians are prone to let the parents take theresponsibility for their children. It is a natural consequence of their view of the society as an organic unity where family life and political affairs should be separated. Leftist communitarians and liberal communitarians are less apparent in their preferences. Stressing leftist communitarians´ emphasis of citizenship duties, the responsibility of the citizen indicates that state measures should not be the first tried solution. The family has an important role for leftist communitarianists but only as a link between the individual and the state. Liberal communitarians look foremost to the individual´ s own preferences concerning medium for a solution of the unemployed´ s situation. Family is not seen as a significant institution, unless it is accredited importance by its members...|$|E
40|$|This {{study has}} been made {{necessary}} {{by the lack of}} an adequate political economy of opera, and related philosophical constructs, to take opera successfully into the twentyfirst century. Despite a history of crises and failure within the UK subsidized opera sector, scant {{attention has been paid to}} the theory of value in opera: a situation not aided by the scarcity and inconsistency of available data pertaining to the financial performance of opera companies and the sector as a whole. The study provides a fresh theoretical approach which will allow those parties with an interest in the artistic value and financial value issues posed by opera to find a common forum. The influence of relevant factors in the environment are discussed, including the trend towards accountability, and the emergence of <b>communitarianist</b> thought in the political agenda. The concept of the transformation of value as the characteristic process of opera is introduced. It is also shown that artistic value is the outcome of transactions between buyers and sellers; that it is irrevocably a market concept. In the context of a democratic market economy there is need, therefore, to widen participation in the artistic value agenda by incorporating the general public within an inclusive artistic value franchise. The history and theory of value is examined with reference to current aesthetic thought (Adorno's version of commodity fetishism, and postmodernism), the economic writings of Marx and Smith, and current explicit and implicit models of value (including the Baumol and Bowen productivity lag model, the Keynesian powerhouse model, public service provision, and the merit good theory). A methodology to gather consistent and reliable data from the mandatory annual financial reports of individual opera companies was developed. The difficulties associated with construction of the resultant data set revealed a lack of accountability within the sector. A long-run parametric study of the UK subsidized opera sector (1976 - 95) was then conducted. Results reveal an inexorable rise in the real cost of opera, and demonstrate, for the first time, the poor long-run performance of the UK subsidized opera sector. Results also confirm the existence of inequities (distributive injustices) in current subsidy policy, the presence of a controlling partial interest within the artistic value franchise (an artocracy), and treatment of artistic value as an exogenous given. It is concluded that these results are an inevitable outcome of the current opera infrastructure, and that there has been inadequate examination and consideration of alternative operational and infrastructural models, some of which are discussed here. Overall, it is concluded that the current, static, opera infrastructure precludes substantive artistic innovation, and that the museum element in the artform resides not in its repertoire, but in its infrastructure...|$|E
40|$|A dissertação relaciona as considerações sobre seguir regras com as críticas ao tratamento extensional do infinito como uma totalidade atual no segundo Wittgenstein. No primeiro capítulo, são apresentadas as críticas de Wittgenstein ao padrão mentalista de solução para determinação do significado, elucidando- se a seguir o que considera-se o cerne do Argumento da Linguagem Privada. A partir disso, argumenta-se que a solução comunitarista, formulada em termos da confirmação de um padrão independente, não pode ser coerentemente atribuída a Wittgenstein. No segundo capítulo, a antinomia histórica entre o infinito pensado como potencial ou como atual é introduzida. São apresentados alguns elementos dos tratamentos propostos por Cantor e Dedekind e, a seguir, as críticas que Wittgenstein faz aos mesmos. No terceiro capítulo, a associação das críticas de Wittgenstein ao tratamento do infinito como uma atualidade extensional com a questão da generalidade lingüística é explorada, e o caráter normativo que Wittgenstein atribui às proposições matemáticas é ressaltado. Mostra-se que, para Wittgenstein, a diferença conceitual entre finito e infinito expressaria a diferença entre contextos empíricos e gramaticais. O infinito, enquanto expressão da generalidade, não poderia ser tratado como passível de descrição extensional sem acarretar confusões, mas só poderia ser pensado no âmbito normativo, enquanto regra. Retorna-se então à questão da determinação de uma regra no contexto da discussão sobre as provas matemáticas e analisa-se a noção de surveyability. No quarto capítulo, considera-se a noção de semelhança de família. Ressalta-se então os pontos centrais da estratégia de Wittgenstein para o problema da determinação de uma regra: o abandono da extensionalidade e da univocidade do significado. Ao invés de classes ou elementos primariamente determinando a relação entre as instâncias de uma regra, teríamos antes a própria relação constituindo tais instâncias, e esta relação interna seria estabelecida na própria prática de emprego lingüístico. Finalmente, na conclusão, elabora- se uma reconsideração do que foi desenvolvido a partir das relações entre generalidade e circularidade. The {{dissertation}} relates second Wittgenstein`s considerations on following rules {{with his}} criticism about the extensional {{treatment of the}} infinite as actual totality. In the first chapter, a presentation of Wittgenstein`s criticism of the mentalist solution pattern for {{the determination of the}} meaning is followed by an account of what is taken to be the heart of the Private Language Argument. On that basis, it is argued that the <b>communitarianist</b> solution, formulated in terms of the confirmation of an independent pattern, cannot be consistently attributed to Wittgenstein. In the second chapter, the historical antinomy between the infinite as potential and the infinite as actual is introduced. Some aspects of Cantor`s and Dedekind`s approaches, as well as Wittgenstein`s criticism of those, are also presented. In the third chapter, the connection between Wittgenstein`s criticism of the treatment of the infinite as extensional actuality and the question of linguistic generality is explored, and the normative character attributed by Wittgenstein to mathematical propositions is highlighted. It is shown that, according to Wittgenstein, the conceptual difference between finite and infinite expresses the difference between empirical and grammatical contexts. The infinite as expression of generality could not be treated as susceptible to extensional description without bringing about confusion, and it should, therefore, be thought of solely in a normative context, as a rule. The problem of the determination of a rule is thus retaken {{in the context of the}} discussion on mathematical proof, and the notion of surveyability is analysed. In the fourth chapter, the notion of family resemblances is considered. The central aspects of Wittgenstein`s approach to the problem of the determination of a rule - the abandonment of extensionality and the univocality of meaning - are emphasised. Instead of classes or elements primarily determining the relationship among the instances of a rule, the relationship itself would constitute such instances, and such internal relationship would be established by linguistic usage itself. Finally, in the conclusion, a general reconsideration of what was discussed is carried out, starting from the relationships between circularity and generality...|$|E
