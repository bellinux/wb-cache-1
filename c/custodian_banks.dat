25|$|So far, the Tedpix index {{has been}} driven by {{domestic}} investors, including wealthy Iranians, public sector pension funds and the investment arms of state-owned banks.

25|$|Institutional investors buy {{and sell}} {{on behalf of their}} {{individual}} clients, be they pension funds, endowments and the like, or pooled funds such as mutual funds, unit trusts or hedge funds.

40|$|The {{competition}} between a central securities depository (CSD) and a <b>custodian</b> <b>bank</b> is analysed in a Stackelberg model. The CSD sets its prices first, the <b>custodian</b> <b>bank</b> follows. There are many investor banks {{each of which}} has to decide whether to use the service of the CSD or of the <b>custodian</b> <b>bank.</b> This decision depends on the prices and the investor bank's preferences for the inhomogeneous services of the two service providers. Since the <b>custodian</b> <b>bank</b> uses services provided by the CSD as input, the CSD can raise its rival's costs. However, due to network externalities, the CSD's equilibrium market share is not necessarily higher than socially optimal. This result has important policy implications that are related to a discussion currently taking place in the securities settlement industry.
