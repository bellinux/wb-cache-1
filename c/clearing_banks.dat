5|$|Although the Bank of England is {{the central}} bank for the UK, three Scottish <b>clearing</b> <b>banks</b> issue Sterling {{banknotes}}: the Bank of Scotland; the Royal Bank of Scotland; and the Clydesdale Bank.

25|$|Although the Bank of England {{remains the}} central bank for the UK Government, three Scottish <b>clearing</b> <b>banks</b> still issue their own {{banknotes}}: the Bank of Scotland, the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Clydesdale Bank. These notes have no status as legal tender (neither have Bank of England banknotes in Scotland); but in practice they are accepted throughout Scotland and by some retailers {{in the rest of}} the UK. The full range of Scottish bank notes commonly accepted are £5, £10, £20, £50 and £100. (See British banknotes for further discussion).|$|E
25|$|Northern Irish {{banknotes}}: Banknotes {{issued by}} Northern Irish banks {{have the same}} legal status as Scottish banknotes {{in that they are}} promissory notes issued in pounds sterling and may be used for cash transactions anywhere in the United Kingdom. However, they are rarely seen outside of Northern Ireland. In England and Wales, although they might be accepted by any shop, they are often not accepted without explanation. Like Scottish notes, <b>clearing</b> <b>banks</b> and building societies will accept them. Northern Irish pound sterling banknotes {{should not be confused with}} the Irish pound (or Punt), the former currency of the Republic of Ireland, which was replaced by the Euro in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Scottish banknotes: These are the {{recognised}} {{currency in}} Scotland, {{although they are}} not legal tender. They are always accepted by traders in Scotland, and are usually accepted {{in other parts of}} the United Kingdom. However, some outside Scotland are unfamiliar with the notes and they are sometimes refused. Institutions such as <b>clearing</b> <b>banks,</b> building societies and the Post Office will readily accept Scottish bank notes. Branches of the Scottish note-issuing banks situated in England dispense Bank of England notes and are not permitted to dispense their own notes from those branches. Modern Scottish banknotes are denominated in pounds sterling, and have exactly the same value as Bank of England notes; they should not be confused with the former Pound Scots, a separate currency which was abolished in 1707.|$|E

Standard Life sold Standard Life Bank plc to Barclays plc in October 2009. The sale was completed on 1 January 2010. On 11 November 2009, Barclays and First Data, a global technology {{provider of information}} commerce, had entered into an agreement according to which Barclays would migrate a range of card portfolios to First Data's issuing and consumer finance platform. On 13 February 2010, Barclays announced it would pay more than £2billion in bonuses. In March 2011 {{it was reported that}} Barclays had overtaken Santander UK to claim top spot as the UK's most complained against bank, with the country's official banking regulator, the Financial Services Authority having recorded 276,315 new customer complaints against Barclays Bank {{during the second half of}} 2010.

2500|$|The {{late 1990s}} saw {{a new wave}} of {{consolidation}} in the financial services sector. In 1997, RBS formed a joint venture to set up Tesco Bank. In 1999, the Bank of Scotland launched a hostile takeover bid for English rival NatWest. The Bank of Scotland intended to fund the deal by selling off many of the NatWest’s subsidiary companies, including Ulster Bank and Coutts. However, the Royal Bank subsequently tabled a counter-offer, sparking off the largest hostile takeover battle in UK corporate history. A key differentiation from the Bank of Scotland’s bid was the Royal Bank’s plan to retain all of NatWest’s subsidiaries. Although NatWest, one of the [...] "Big 4" [...] English <b>clearing</b> <b>banks,</b> was significantly larger than either Scottish bank, it had a recent history of poor financial performance and plans to merge with insurance company Legal & General were not well received, prompting a 26% fall in share price.|$|E

40|$|The species {{richness}} of fishes and the distributions of six fish species were compared among four habitat types, snaggy <b>banks,</b> <b>clear</b> <b>banks,</b> mud banks and mid channels, in an estuary in tropical Australia. Both {{day and night}} samples were collected in fish traps, on four occasions, three months apart. On each sampling trip {{the highest number of}} species was trapped from snaggy habitats, intermediate numbers from <b>clear</b> <b>banks</b> or mud banks, and the fewest species from mid channels. Although more species occurred in night than in day samples, the pattern of difference among habitats was consistent. The probability of capture of the six most abundant species, Acanthopagrus australis, Acanthopagrus berda, Arothron manilensis, Arius argyropleuron, Epinephelus coioides and Lutjanus russelli, was compared among habitat types and between day and night samples. Overall, snag habitats tended to be associated with high probabilities of capture of a number of species, particularly A. berda and L. russelli. At night, mid channels were characterized by high numbers of A. argyropleuron. <b>Clear</b> and mud <b>banks,</b> and day samples from mid channels were associated with low numbers of most species...|$|R
