5000|$|The Gillies Report sketch (available on YouTube) also parodied Packer's own recent self-serving {{appearance}} {{to defend himself}} on his own network's current affairs show, which was in itself a highly unusual move for the notoriously media-wary millionaire. It opened with Patrick Cook, in barrister's garb, putting questions to 'Packer' (Gillies), about the allegations. He at first responds amiably, but gradually becomes enraged by the interrogation, and the hostile reaction of the audience, and finally smashes up his desk, revealing {{that he has a}} long lizard-like tail. As the cast perform a satirical quasi-operatic song about the <b>case,</b> <b>Packer</b> - now transformed into [...] "The Goanna" [...] - is pursued through the TV station by the mob, but (parodying King Kong) he escapes by scaling the transmitter tower of Packer's Sydney TV station TCN-9 where, now grown to gigantic size, he catches and crushes a news helicopter from a rival network. The desk-smashing also lampooned Packer's famously volcanic temper, and referenced a well-known rumour of the time, which claimed that Packer once smashed up his own office in a fit of rage during one of his many attempts to quit smoking.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The packing robot in China is less {{developed}} than western countries at present. For the demand of packaging {{in food and}} beverage industry, the integrated <b>case</b> <b>packer</b> based on robot is developed and used in production line. The scheme and layout of the system with seven subsystems is proposed. With {{the identification of the}} critical path, the process is analyzed to improve the efficiency of the integrated <b>case</b> <b>packer.</b> Finally, path planning and motion parameters of packing operation are optimized and its experimental research is carried out, which verifies the feasibility of system design. The equipment is applied in Hangzhou WaHaha Group Co., Ltd. with a desired result...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{performance}} analysis and optimization for Carbonated Soft Drink Glass Bottle (CSDGB) filling system of a beverage plant using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approach. The CSDGB system consists of seven main subsystems arranged in series namely Uncaser, Bottle Washer, Electronic Inspection Station, Filling Machine, Crowner, Coding Machine and <b>Case</b> <b>Packer.</b> Considering exponential distribution for probable failures and repairs, mathematical modeling is performed using Markov Approach (MA). The differential equations have been derived {{on the basis of}} probabilistic approach using transition diagram. These equations are solved using normalizing condition and recursive method to drive out the steady state availability expression of the system i. e. system’s performance criterion. The performance optimization of system has been carried out by varying the number of particles and number of generations. It has been observed that the maximum availability of 90. 27 % is achieved at flock size of 55 and 90. 84 % at 300 th generation. Thus, findings of the paper will be useful to the plant management for execution of proper maintenance decisions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{perform an}} {{optimization}} and sensitivity analysis for design of an Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) with horizontal wells and multiple fracturing stages. The sensitivity analysis includes calculations of thermal breakthrough and the {{maximum flow rate}} {{that can be achieved}} through the system. The analysis uses idealized reservoir geometry and is intended to investigate the relationship between parameters and provide insight into how to optimize an EGS, not to provide precise predictions of performance. Conventionally, EGS wells have been nearly vertical and stimulated with openhole completion in a single stage. This study investigates a design with two parallel horizontal wells. The first well is drilled and completed with casing, and then stimulated sequentially in stages with <b>cased</b> hole <b>packers</b> rated to high temperature. The second well is drilled through the stimulated region created around the first well and completed openhole. For different combinations of well spacing, lateral length, formation permeability, and number of stages, we calculate the optimal flow rate that maximizes the present value of revenue. The calculations show that stimulating with multiple stages greatly improves economic performance, delays thermal breakthrough, and allows a higher flow rate to be circulated through the system. At low well spacing and low number of stages, it is optimal to circulate fluid more slowly than the maximum possible rate in order to delay thermal breakthrough. With greater well spacing and with more stages, thermal breakthrough is relatively delayed, and it is optimal to circulate at the maximum possible flow rate. Overall, it is optimal to use the lowest well spacing where present value is maximized by circulating at the maximum possible rate. When it is optimal to circulate at the maximum possible rate, present value is sensitive to reservoir transmissivity. When it is optimal to circulate at less than the maximum possible rate, present value is unaffected by reservoir transmissivity. Increasing lateral length beyond 1000 m is only beneficial for designs with relatively low lateral spacing and a large number of stages...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMulti-stage SRV {{fracturing}} in horizontal wells is a {{new technology}} developed {{at home and abroad}} in recent years to effectively develop shale gas or low-permeability reservoirs, {{but on the other hand}} makes the mechanical environment of fracturing strings more complicated at the same time. In view of this, based on the loading features of tubing strings during the multi-stage fracturing of a horizontal well, mechanical models were established for three working <b>cases</b> of multiple <b>packer</b> setting, open differential-pressure sliding sleeve, and open ball-injection sliding sleeve under a hold-down packer. Moreover, mathematical models were respectively built for the above three cases. According to the Lame formula and Von Mises stress calculation formula for the thick-walled cylinder in the theory of elastic mechanics, a mathematical model was also established to calculate the equivalent stress for tubing string safety evaluation when the fracturing string was under the combined action of inner pressure, external squeezing force and axial stress, and another mathematical model was built for the mechanical strength and safety evaluation of multi-stage fracturing strings. In addition, a practical software was developed for the mechanical safety evaluation of horizontal well multi-stage fracturing strings according to the mathematical model developed for the mechanical calculation of the multi-packer string in horizontal wells. The research results were applied and verified in a gas well of Tahe Oilfield in the Tarim Basin with excellent effects, providing a theoretical basis and a simple and reliable technical means for optimal design and safety evaluation of safe operational parameters of multi-stage fracturing strings in horizontal wells...|$|R
