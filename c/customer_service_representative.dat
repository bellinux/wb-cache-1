40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{the study}} was to {{identify}} those personality traits and resilience factors that could influence the ability of <b>Customer</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Representatives</b> in a call centre to manage burnout effectively. A cross-sectional survey design was used and the sample consisted of 187 <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> <b>representatives</b> from a call centre. The Big Five Personality Structure was utilised to measure personality traits by means of the International Personality Item Pool. The Resilience Scale and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (General Survey) were used to measure resilience and burnout respectively. By means of multiple stepwise regression analysis, significant linear relationships were identified between two of the Big Five personality factors, Conscientiousness, and Agreeableness, and several of the dimensions of burnout. Resilience was found to have a significant influence on two burnout dimensions, namely Cynicism/Depersonalisation and Professional Efficacy, respectively. The results are informative in terms of its use for future selection and development purposes of <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> <b>representatives</b> employed in call centres. 1 Address for correspondence...|$|R
