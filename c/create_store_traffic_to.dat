Based on their multivariate time-series analysis, the authors demonstrate permanent performance effects of store brand entry, typically benefiting the retailer, the consumers, and premium-brand manufacturers, while harming second-tier brand manufacturers. For the, they consistently find two of store brand entry:. This increase in unit margins implies that the retailer strengthens its bargaining position vis-à-vis national brand manufacturers. However, store brand entry only rarely yields category expansion and does not <b>create</b> <b>store</b> <b>traffic</b> or revenue benefits. Second, do not obtain lower prices on all national brands, only on some second-tier brands. However, they benefit from enlarged product assortment and intensified promotional activity that lowers average price paid for two out of four categories.

40|$|The Intel ® Itanium ™ {{architecture}} {{provides a}} virtual register stack of unlimited size {{for use by}} software. New virtual registers are allocated on a procedure call and deallocated on return. Itanium processors implement the register stack {{by means of a}} large physical register file, a mapping from virtual to physical registers, and a Register Stack Engine (RSE) that saves and restores the contents of the physical registers to memory without explicit program intervention. The combination of these features significantly reduces the number of loads and stores required to save registers across procedure calls compared to a conventional architecture. In this paper, we show that the Itanium register stack reduces load and <b>store</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>to</b> the stack by at least a factor of three across select SpecInt 2000 and Oracle database benchmarks. Furthermore, we examine the effects of the register stack on data cache miss rates and program execution time. When compared to a conventional architecture, the Itanium architecture on average achieves 7 %- 8. 3 % and 10. 2 %- 12 % performance advantage on in-order and out-of-order processor models, respectively, {{as a result of the}} register stack. Finally we analyze the vitality of stack loads and show that in general few stack loads are vital in an in-order model. However, a larger percentage of stack loads become vital in the out-of-order model leading to a greater performance benefit from the register stack. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} dynamic {{programming}} framework for retailers of frequently purchased consumer goods {{in which the}} prices affect both the profit per visit {{in the current period}} and the number of visitors (i. e., <b>store</b> <b>traffic)</b> in future periods. We show that optimal category prices in the infinite-horizon problem also maximize the closed form sum of a geometric series, allowing us to derive meaningful analytical results. Modeling the linkage between category prices and future <b>store</b> <b>traffic</b> fundamentally changes optimal pricing policy. Optimal pricing must balance current profits against future traffic; under general conditions, optimal long-run prices are uniformly lower across all categories than those that maximize current profits. This result explains the empirical generalization that category demand in grocery stores is inelastic. Parameterizing profit per visit and <b>store</b> <b>traffic</b> reveals that, as future traffic becomes more sensitive to price, retailers should increasingly lower current prices and sacrifice current profits. We also determine how the burden of drawing future <b>traffic</b> <b>to</b> the <b>store</b> should be distributed across categories; this is the foundation for a new taxonomy of category roles. marketing, dynamic programming, pricing, optimization, retailing, <b>store</b> <b>traffic...</b>|$|R

The main objective {{of this paper is}} to understand the factors that determine across-retailer variation in category performance as measured by the Category Development Index (CDI). Based on data from 19 food categories sold in 85 major supermarket chains operating in the largest 50 retail markets in the U.

In addition, the best performing retailers also are more likely to engage in a formal category management process.

How do these different topics affect company performance? And which specific marketing communication (online, TV, radio, print) obtains most of its performance impact by stimulating eWOM topics? This paper quantifies the dynamic interactions among marketing, eWOM content, search, and online and offline <b>store</b> <b>traffic</b> for an apparel retailer. While it yields a similar online <b>store</b> <b>traffic</b> lift, advertising-related eWOM yields only half the offline <b>store</b> <b>traffic</b> lift of brand-related eWOM and of neutral eWOM about purchasing at the retailer. Paid search shows the highest elasticity in stimulating online conversations, but drives less business than offline marketing actions. While TV is the main paid driver of online <b>store</b> <b>traffic,</b> print is the main paid driver of offline <b>store</b> <b>traffic</b> for the studied retailer.

25|$|Trafficking {{diverted}} {{an estimated}} one cent of each SNAP dollar ($330 million annually) from SNAP benefits between 2006 and 2008. Trafficking has declined over time from nearly 4 {{percent in the}} 1990s. About 8.2 percent of all <b>stores</b> <b>trafficked</b> from 2006 <b>to</b> 2008 compared to the 10.5 percent of SNAP authorized <b>stores</b> involved in <b>trafficking</b> in 2011. A variety of store characteristics and settings {{were related to the}} level of <b>trafficking.</b> Although large <b>stores</b> accounted for 87.3 percent of all SNAP redemptions, they only accounted for about 5.4 percent of trafficking redemptions. Trafficking was much less likely to occur among publicly owned than privately owned stores and was much less likely among stores in areas with less poverty rather than more. The total annual value of trafficked benefits increased at about the same rate as overall program growth. The current estimate of total SNAP dollars trafficked is higher than observed in the previous 2002–2005 time period. This increase is consistent, however, with the almost 37 percent growths in average annual SNAP benefits from the 2002–2005 study periods to the most recent one. The methodology used to generate these estimates has known limitations. However, given variable data and resources, it is the most practical approach available to FNS. Further improvements <b>to</b> SNAP <b>trafficking</b> estimates would require new resources to assess the prevalence of trafficking among a random sample of stores.|$|R

In this paper, we use proprietary data pertaining to an apparel retailer {{to study the}} relationship between <b>store</b> <b>traffic,</b> labor, and sales performance. We decompose sales volume into conversion rate (defined as the ratio of number of transactions <b>to</b> <b>traffic)</b> and basket value (defined as the ratio of sales volume to number of transactions) and analyze the impact of traffic on sales and its components. We find that store sales volume exhibits diminishing returns to scale with respect <b>to</b> <b>traffic,</b> and labor moderates the impact of traffic on sales. For example, we find that for values of traffic and labor corresponding to the mean, increasing average traffic per hour by one unit increases average sales volume per hour by $ 9. 97.

40|$|Due to the {{downward}} sloping demand curve, a retailer can use price promotions <b>to</b> induce <b>store</b> <b>traffic.</b> On the other hand, price promotions can bring negative effects that increase consumers' conditional risks over quality, {{so that the}} results expected by retailers may not be achieved. This study investigates whether manufacturer advertising can mitigate the negative effects caused by retailer price promotions. A rational expectation model shows that the relation between advertising and price promotions is not unidirectional. A threshold exists that can ensure whether an increase in advertising expenditures reduces negative effects from price promotions. When advertising coverage exceeds this threshold, an increase in advertising expenditures mitigates negative effects and makes price promotions an effective way <b>to</b> build <b>store</b> <b>traffic.</b> Below the threshold, an increase in advertising expenditures might aggravate the negative effects from price promotions and decrease price sensitivity. Accordingly, marketing practitioners can design product pricing decisions depending on whether advertising information crosses this threshold. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Attack {{signature}} validation plays a {{key role}} in intrusion detection and prevention technologies. Usually, when new attacks, particularly worms, appear, security software analyzes and generates signatures for these attacks. Since inaccurate signatures may block legitimate traffic that is similar <b>to</b> the attack <b>traffic</b> (false positives), security software is reluctant to deploy new signatures without extensive testing. The testing procedure, however, can be time consuming, resulting in significant delays (hours or even days) in signature dissemination. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel architecture based on P 2 P technology for fast content signature validation. The basic idea is to collect and <b>store</b> recent network <b>traffic</b> at peers participating in the system in advance and use it to validate new signatures. Since the amount of <b>traffic</b> that needs <b>to</b> be checked against is huge, we also propose a high-performance validation algorithm over <b>stored</b> <b>traffic</b> data. Experimental results show that our proposed system can validate candidate attack signatures and determine potential false positives rates in just a few seconds.
