25|$|By the 19th century, Congregationalists were forming {{voluntary}} {{organizations for}} mutual <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>support</b> among churches called associations. In some places, state-wide general associations were organized. In 1801, the Congregationalist churches of New England {{entered into a}} formal agreement with the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America called the Plan of Union. It remained in effect until 1852. By that time, Congregationalists had developed a greater denominational consciousness, which ultimately led to the first National Council in 1865.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} Adrian Donohoe was {{strongly}} condemned by the President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins and the Taoiseach, Enda Kenny. Cabinet ministers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland also {{spoke out against}} the crime. Minister for Justice Alan Shatter said that {{those responsible for the}} murder had planned it, knew that there would be police attending the credit union for an escort, and that the officers were ambushed. He warned that the perpetrators would each face the mandatory 40 years in prison for killing a garda, regardless of who fired the shot if they did not turn themselves in. Commissioner Martin Callinan vowed to hunt down and apprehend the killers. The PSNI, under Chief Constable Matt Baggott, pledged their full <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>support</b> to bring to justice the murderers.|$|E
25|$|Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah also {{introduced}} organizational forms that gave Ismāʿīlī communities {{the means to}} structure and regulate their own affairs. These were built on the Muslim tradition of a communitarian ethic on the one hand, and responsible individual conscience with freedom to negotiate one's own moral commitment and destiny on the other. In 1905 he ordained the first Ismā'īlī Constitution for the social governance of the community in East Africa. The new administration for the Community's affairs was organised into a hierarchy of councils at the local, national, and regional levels. The constitution also set out rules in such matters as marriage, divorce and inheritance, guidelines for mutual <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>support</b> among Ismā'īlīs, and their interface with other communities. Similar constitutions were promulgated in India, and all were periodically revised to address emerging needs and circumstances in diverse settings.|$|E

2500|$|Diệm's {{government}} also encouraged {{the development of}} handicraft, industry, and commerce. In October 1957, Diệm established Center for technological development for investment, instruction, <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>support</b> private technological activities to gradually diminish the role of foreign capitalists, especially French capitalists in industry and to enhance the role of indigenous capitalists in RVN economy. In 1961, Diệm suggested the second 5-year plan (1962–1966) to continue the first 5-year plan. During the first Republic of Vietnam, some indigenous industrial zones or factories were founded, such as: paper factory Cogido in An Hảo (1961), Textile factories Vinatexco and Vimytex, glassware factory Khánh Hội, Cement factories Hà Tiên and Thủ Đức, Hydroelectric power factory Đa Nhim (1961), Đà Lạt nuclear research centre (1963), Biên Hòa industrial zone (1963)... During 1956–1960, Diệm built a relatively stable RVN with a stable economy along with the development in infrastructure and people's standards of living due to export of home comforts. Nevertheless, Diệm also admitted the dependence of RVN's economy on the US assistance: [...] "Today, {{the country is not}} self-sufficient. We can say that foreign assistance is a kind of compensation for the services our people have provided to the free world to protect SEA market, and to fight against manipulations of international communism".|$|E
2500|$|On September 26, 2002, {{during a}} {{stopover}} in New York City {{en route from}} a family vacation in Tunisia to Montreal, Arar was detained by the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). [...] The INS was acting upon information supplied by the RCMP. When it became clear {{he was going to}} be deported, Arar requested he be deported to Canada; though he had not visited Syria since his move to Canada, he retained Syrian citizenship as Syria does not permit the renunciation of citizenship. Canadian (initially) and United States officials have labelled his transfer to Syria as a deportation, but critics have called the removal an example of rendition for torture by proxy, as the Syrian government is infamous for its torture of detainees. Despite the recent public rhetoric, at the time of Arar's deportation, Syria was working closely with the United States government in their [...] "War on Terror." [...] In November 2003, Cofer Black, then counterterrorism coordinator at the US State Department and former director of counterterrorism at the CIA, was quoted as saying [...] "The Syrian government has provided some very useful assistance on al Qaeda in the past."}} In September 2002, the George W. Bush administration opposed the enactment of the [...] "Syria Accountability Act" [...] citing effectiveness of current sanctions and the ongoing diplomacy in the region. In addition, the administration noted the <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>support</b> by Syria in fighting al-Qaida as a reason for its opposition to the [...] "Syria Accountability Act." ...|$|E
2500|$|The initial {{funding and}} {{development}} of the Iron Dome system was provided and undertaken by Israel. This allowed for the deployment of the first two Iron Dome systems. Subsequently, funding for an additional eight Iron Dome systems—along with funding for a supply of interception missiles—is currently being provided by the United States, with two of these additional systems having been delivered by 2012. Funding for the production and deployment of these additional Iron Dome batteries and interceptor missiles was approved by the United States Congress, after being requested by President Obama in 2010. In May 2010, the White House announced that U.S. President Barack Obama would seek $205million from U.S. Congress in his 2011 budget, to spur the production and deployment of additional Iron Dome batteries. White House spokesman Tommy Vietor stated, [...] "The president recognizes the threat missiles and rockets fired by Hamas and Hezbollah pose to Israelis, and has therefore decided to seek funding from Congress to support the production of Israel's short range rocket defense system called Iron Dome." [...] This would be the first direct U.S. investment in the project. Such financial assistance could expedite the completion of the defensive system, which has long been delayed by budgetary shortfalls. A few days later, on 20 May 2010, the U.S. House of Representatives approved the funding in a 410–4 vote. The bill, the United States–Israel Missile Defense <b>Cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Support</b> Act (H.R. 5327), was sponsored by Representative Glenn C. Nye of Virginia. This money was expected {{to be included in the}} 2011 budget. Once the money was received in 2011, it still took a further 18 months before the additional batteries were delivered to the air force.|$|E
