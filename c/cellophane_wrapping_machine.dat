50|$|Whoppers {{were first}} sold unwrapped, two pieces for one cent. But after the {{creation}} of <b>cellophane</b> <b>wrapping</b> <b>machines,</b> smaller Whoppers were packaged and sold five for one cent, also known as Fivesomes. Leaf soon introduced the first confectionery milk carton package which would become {{a hallmark of the}} candy. Sometime between 1949 and 1952 an egg-shaped Whoppers candy was introduced for Easter. They differ from the traditional Whoppers in being egg shaped and having a speckled candy shell.|$|R

50|$|Spangles was a {{brand of}} boiled sweets {{manufactured}} by Mars Ltd in the United Kingdom from 1950 to the early 1980s. They were sold in a paper tube with individual sweets originally unwrapped but later <b>cellophane</b> <b>wrapped.</b> They were distinguished by their shape which was a rounded square with a circular depression on each face.|$|R
50|$|A {{small number}} of vinyl copies of the album contain no title on the front cover. This is because the cover was {{originally}} supposed {{to be just a}} picture of Lightfoot, but it was then thought that stating the title would increase the album's sales. The untitled copies did have a small sticker on the <b>cellophane</b> <b>wrap</b> bearing the album's title.|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} examines {{cell proliferation}} in the pancreas of the Syrian golden hamster. Three main themes are pursued. First, normal pancreatic {{growth and development}} is reviewed. Emphasis is placed on histogenesis and trophic stimuli. Secondly, modulation of pancreatic growth is examined. A new method for producing partial pancreatic duct obstruction using a technique of <b>cellophane</b> <b>wrapping</b> is described. The histologic alterations induced by wrapping {{are the same as}} those associated with the early changes of chemical pancreatic carcinogenesis [...] duct epithelial hyperplasia, metaplasia and nesidioblastosis. Morphometric, immunocytochemical, autoradiographic and G. I. hormone analysis are also utilized to characterize this model. Importantly, experimental nesidioblastosis can result in islets which are functionally capable of reversing streptozocin-induced diabetes. Thirdly, aberrant pancreatic growth was investigated in relation to carcinogenesis. Clinical cancer epidemiology is reviewed with special reference to risk factors and postulated trophic influences. Experimentally, the trophic effects of diet, cholecystectomy and duct obstruction were investigated. Finally a new model for the induction of carcinoma of the head of the pancreas, using <b>cellophane</b> <b>wrapping</b> in association with a chemical carcinogen, is presented...|$|R

40|$|PT. Sanbe Farma Unit III is an {{pharmaceutical}} company produces infusion {{as one of}} its product. In the process of packaging Flipped-off (FO) type of infusion, there is wrapping process done by <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine.</b> At this process is expected no defect product [...] However, in fact defect product is still exist. In March to May 2016 total reject products in a row are 1204 bags, 1357 bags, and 960 bags. It happened because <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> is often experienced breakdown. Based of those problems above, observation is done to find the biggest loss factor of the <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine,</b> measuring overall <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> effectiveness, and to do an improvement that will decrease downtime of <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine.</b> Problem solving is done by measuring Six Big Losses and use pareto diagram to find the biggest loss factor. Fishbone diagram is also used to find factors that affect the biggest loss factor. Next step is measuring Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) of <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine.</b> To measure OEE, the calculation of Availability, Performace Efficiency, and Quality rate are needed first. Then those values is compared with the world standard of each value. Based on this whole observation, there are two biggest loss factors, they are reduced speed and idling and minor stoppages. These loss factors influenced the value of Performance Efficiency which is lower than the world standard, based on the measurement that had been done. The calculation result shows that OEE value of <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> from March to May 2016 are still under the standard, i. e. 82, 08...|$|R

5000|$|Lucozade {{originally}} {{was available in}} only one variety, which was effervescent with a distinctive sweet citric flavour. It was sold in a glass bottle with a yellow <b>Cellophane</b> <b>wrap</b> until 1983, when Lucozade was rebranded as an energy drink to shift the brand's associations away from illness. The slogan [...] "Lucozade aids recovery" [...] was replaced by [...] "Lucozade replaces lost energy". The glass bottle {{was replaced by a}} plastic (polyethylene terephthalate, PET) one.

50|$|Most <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> designs carry {{a single}} drum of cable {{on one side}} of the machine and {{therefore}} require a counterweight on the opposite side to provide lateral stability. As a minimum, the counterweight is adjustable at each pole or tower to reflect the reduced weight of the payload at the end of each span. The more sophisticated designs of <b>wrapping</b> <b>machines</b> have automatically adjusting counterweights that maintain balance throughout the span as the cable drum becomes progressively lighter. This is normally achieved by arranging for the counterweight move inwards towards the machine axis as the machine travels forward. Such devices are essential for span lengths greater than 250 - 300m. Ideally, the centre of gravity of the rotating part of the <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> should lie on the axis of the host conductor at all times. The centre of gravity of the complete <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> will always be below the axis of the host conductor.|$|R

50|$|Light {{weight in}} order to keep the total weight of <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> and cable payload as small as possible.|$|R
50|$|The {{turning moment}} arises because the <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> passes a heavy drum of cable around the machine axis {{so as to}} wrap the fibre optic cable onto the host conductor. This motion is {{achieved}} {{by means of a}} gearbox that converts the linear travel of the <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> along the conductor into a rotating movement of the drum carrier. The force of moving the drum in one direction (say clockwise around the conductor) causes a resultant force to act on the machine in the opposite direction, making the <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> spin on its own axis (counter-clockwise in this example). Frictional effects from the machine’s grip on the conductor can be used to counter this to some degree, but in practice it is insufficient and the required stability can only be achieved by having a relatively large weight suspended rigidly below the conductor from the non-rotating part of the <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine.</b> The motor unit is heavy, has a good grip on the conductor and so is often used to provide the necessary stability. For rope-pulled machines with no motor unit, a separate ‘keel weight’ is used to achieve the same effect.|$|R

50|$|Strong, direct {{sunlight}} or incandescent light can adversely react with phenolic compounds in wine and create potential wine faults. Delicate, light-bodied white wines run {{the greatest risk}} from light exposure, and for that reason, they are often packaged in darkly tinted wine bottles that offer some protection from the light. Wines packaged in clear, light green and blue colored bottles are the most vulnerable to light, and may need extra precautions for storage. For example, the Champagne house of Louis Roederer uses <b>cellophane</b> <b>wrap</b> to protect its premium cuvee Cristal from light, the wine being packaged in a clear bottle. In the cellar, wines are stored in corrugated boxes or wooden crates to protect the wines from direct light.|$|R

They {{have been known to}} play dressed only in clear <b>cellophane</b> <b>wrap</b> or have vocalist Matt Pakulski locked inside a speaker cabinet for the entire duration of a live show. Their 1997 tour of the UK and Ireland featured a fifth member playing saxophone that drew comparisons to Captain Beefheart, and for their 1998 tour of the U.S and Japan the band built a set of oscillators that were activated by choreographed dances on four small trampolines. These homemade electronic instruments were later condensed into a more manageable helmet form that the band would wear and play songs on in the midst of their more guitar-based set.|$|R
