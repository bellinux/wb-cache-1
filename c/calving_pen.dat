40|$|Sixty of the 65 {{dairy farms}} with cubicle {{houses in the}} Norwegian county of Oppland were {{included}} in a field study of the management of calving in 1990. The farmers recorded {{the location of the}} cow when giving birth, farmer presence and whether assistance was given during calving, occurrence of suckling, and time after birth when cow and calf were separated. Such data were recorded for a total of 1125 calvings. About 10 % occurred on pasture, while 78 % of the remaining calvings took place in the cubicle-equipped section. Thirteen percent calved in a <b>calving</b> <b>pen,</b> the remaining cows being tethered at the time of calving. Thirty-two percent of the calvings took place in houses lacking a <b>calving</b> <b>pen</b> altogether. Farmers were present during 41 % of the calvings. Suckling most frequently occurred after pasture calvings, and was least frequent after calvings within the cubicle-equipped section of the cowhouse. Injuries to the calf caused by trampling or contact with fittings etc. were rare, and no more common in association with calving in the cubicle-equipped section than with calving taking place with the cow isolated {{from the rest of the}} herd. All calves were removed from their dams within 24 h after birth. </p...|$|E
40|$|Control of paratuberculosis is {{challenging}} {{due to the}} relatively poor performance of diagnostic tests, a prolonged incubation period, and protracted environmental survival. Prioritization of herd-level interventions is not possible because putative risk factors are often not supported by risk factor studies. The objective {{for this study was}} to investigate the relative importance of risk factors for an increased probability of herd paratuberculosis infection. Risk assessment data, comprehensive animal purchase history, and diagnostic test data were available for 936 Irish dairy herds. Both logistic regression and a Bayesian β regression on the outcome of a latent class analysis were conducted. Population attributable fractions and proportional reduction in variance explained were calculated for each variable in the logistic and Bayesian models, respectively. Routine use of the calving area for sick or lame cows was found to be a significant explanatory covariate in both models. Purchasing behavior for the previous 10 yr was not found to be significant. For the logistic model, length of time calves spend in the <b>calving</b> <b>pen</b> (25 %) and routine use of the <b>calving</b> <b>pen</b> for sick or lame animals (14 %) had the highest attributable fractions. For the Bayesian model, the overall R 2 was 16 %. Dry cow cleanliness (7 %) and routine use of the calving area for sick or lame cows (6 %) and had the highest proportional reduction in variance explained. These findings provide support for several management practices commonly recommended as part of paratuberculosis control programs; however, a large proportion of the observed variation in probability of infection remained unexplained, suggesting other important risks factors may exist...|$|E
40|$|As most of {{production}} pathologies in dairy farming, mastitis {{is characterized by}} a multifactorial aetiology. Its diagnosis and treatment requires a good knowledge of its determinant and predisposing factors. The comparative epidemiology of 349 walloon farms registered to individual milk analysis programs led to highlight the practices used in farms whose last 3 months' herd somatic cell count was above 400. 000 cells/ml. We identified the following risk indicators relative to 1) herd demography : age, composition, herd production average, percentage of high cell counts animals 2) the animal housing : use of straw as bedding stall for all classes of animals and lack of a <b>calving</b> <b>pen</b> 3) the milking machine : milking cups cleaning 4) the dairy practices : lack of washing cloth towels between 2 milkings, occasional foremilk check, stripping, lack of post-dip and 5) animal nutrition : mould on beet pulp silos and composition of the main concentrate.

40|$|Background: The {{molecular}} {{mechanisms by}} which stress induces the development of pathologies remains unclear, although it is recognised {{that one of the}} major factors affecting health as a consequence of stress is the involvement of the neuroendocrine system. In cattle, a number of necessary husbandry practices have been shown to activate the stress response, yet very {{little is known about the}} impact these have at the molecular level. The objectives of the study were to characterise, in male and female beef calves, the immune response to weaning stress in bovine leukocytes at the physiological and molecular levels and to assess the difference between calves weaned in the presence of the dam and those weaned and penned away from the dam. Results: Following exposure to weaning stress, total neutrophil number and neutrophil:lymphocyte (N:L) ratio increased (P < 0. 01) in calves. Additionally, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, including IL- 1 β, IL- 8, IFN-γ and TNFα, were up-regulated (P < 0. 01). Furthermore, there was increased (P < 0. 001) expression of the glucocorticoid receptor, GRα, the pro-apoptotic gene, Fas and the Gram-negative pattern recognition receptor, TLR 4. <b>Calves</b> <b>penned</b> away from the dam post-weaning had increased (P < 0. 01) neutrophil number and N:L ratio compared with <b>calves</b> <b>penned</b> next to the dam, and female calves had higher (P < 0. 05) expression levels of IL- 2, IL- 8, IFN-γ and TNFα than male calves. Conclusions: Weaning elicits an immediate and somewhat short-lived acute stress response in the calf. The effects serve to enhance, rather than suppress, the immune response by means of a heightened inflammatory response and cellular mobilization. The earlier and more profound increase in neutrophil number and N:L ratio together with reduced lymphocyte number in <b>calves</b> <b>penned</b> away compared with <b>calves</b> <b>penned</b> near their dams post-weaning suggests that the former may be more sensitive to weaning stress. The data also show a clear effect of gender in differential gene expression in response to stress with IFN-γ having increased expression in female calves compared with male calves over the course of the study.

Time of calving, location of the breaking of the amniotic sac, as well as the place of birth were recorded. In all but 1 case cows calved within a distance of 1 cow length from where the previous calving took place, suggesting that the cows did not select calving site at random.

Data from 176 calves were used to assess the effect of time spent in the calving area, individual versus non-designated calving and colostrum pasteurisation on serum total protein, zinc sulphate turbidity, globulin and γ-glutamyltransferase. In addition, the effects of colostrum quality, volume of colostrum fed, method of colostrum administration and calving season on passive transfer were quantified.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine barning conditions of dairy farms registered to Cattle Breeders Association (CBA) Ödemiş district of İzmir. The 92 farms were selected among members of the CBA by proportional sampling method. The farms were divided into three groups according to the number of cattle: group 1 from 5 to 20, group 2 from 21 to 40 and group 3 with over 41 heads, respectively. The farms were divided into three groups according to the number of cattle: 5 - 20; 21 - 40 and over 41 heads, respectively. The research results indicated that 76. 1 % of the barns were shed type, 15. 2 % were corral, 8. 7 % were completely closed-up. The flooring types of these barns were a mixed of concrete and soil (73. 9 %), concrete (19. 6 %) and soil (6. 5 %). The stocking density for group 1, 2 and 3 were 22. 2 m 2, 19. 5 m 2 and 18. 2 m 2 per cow, respectively. The barns had a range of full cattle capacity from 12. 5 m 2 to 15 m 2 per cow. But none of the farms surveyed did not use fully capacity of the barn. The present running capacity of farms were between 55 % and 80 %. It was observed that 19. 6 % of farms had a individual calf section, 82. 6 % had a night lighting at the barn, and 64. 1 % had a seperate concenrated feed store. All the farms were milked with milking machines. The percentage of farms with bucked milking machine was 47. 8 %, those with an air pipeline system was 37 % and those with parlour system was 15. 2 %. None of farms had manure pit. Consequently, as herd size grow, the presence of free barn, <b>calving</b> <b>pen,</b> feed store and milk cooling tank increase.

40|$|AbstractA {{systematic}} {{review of the}} scientific literature on relationships between management practices used on dairy farms and herd somatic cell count (SCC) was undertaken to distinguish those management practices that have been consistently shown {{to be associated with}} herd SCC from those lacking evidence of association. Relevant literature was identified using a combination of database searches (PubMed, Medline, CAB, Agricola, and Web of Science) and iterative screening of references. To be included in the review, a manuscript had to be published after 1979 in French, English, or Dutch; study design had to be other than case report or case series; herds studied had to be composed of ≥ 40 milking cows producing on average ≥ 7, 000 kg of milk in 305 d; interventions studied had to be management practices applied at the herd level and used as udder health control strategies; and SCC had to be measured using electronic cell counting methods. The 36 manuscripts selected were mainly observational cross-sectional studies; 8 manuscripts dealt exclusively with automatic milking systems and 4 with management of calves and heifers and its effect on SCC in early lactation heifers. Most practices having consistent associations with SCC were related to milking procedures: wearing gloves during milking, using automatic take-offs, using postmilking teat dipping, milking problem cows last, yearly inspection of the milking system, and use of a technique to keep cows standing following milking; all were consistently associated with lower herd SCC. Other practices associated with lower SCC were the use of a freestall system, sand bedding, cleaning the <b>calving</b> <b>pen</b> after each calving, surveillance of dry-cow udders for mastitis, use of blanket dry-cow therapy, parenteral selenium supplementation, udder hair management, and frequent use of the California Mastitis Test. Regarding SCC of heifers, most of the consistent associations reported were related to interventions made during the peripartum period. Studies on automatic milking systems have frequently reported elevation of the herd SCC following transition to the new system. These elevations seemed to be mediated both by the lack of monitoring of chronically infected cows and by an elevated incidence of intramammary infections. By assembling the results reported in many different studies, this review generates a more comprehensive understanding of the management practices influencing SCC and highlights areas of SCC control knowledge that lack evidence of effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|In Belgium, {{the main}} {{economic}} penalty accounted for bovine milk quality is the bulk milk somatic cell count geometric mean over 3 months reaching more than 400, 000 cells/ml. Yet, {{it is still}} difficult to make progress on udder health and milk quality because regional risks related to endemic farming practices are not broadly known. Hence, {{a first step in}} understanding specific udder health risks associated with herd management has to be a broad ecopathological survey. A random stratified sample of 349 dairy farms, representing 25 % of producers registered for performance recording, was selected with a total of 16, 000 cows. Thorough audits recording 400 farming practices were made in each farm by 2 different surveyors during milking. The practices were recorded across four categories: Herd structure, Housing, Milking practices and Herd Management (including Nutrition). Our chosen variable was the geometric mean of the herd composite somatic cell count from the last three months compared to the 400, 000 cells/ml European threshold. The sample had a mean somatic cell count of 287, 000 cells/ml following a normal distribution between 73, 000 and 807, 000 cells/ml. From 19 risk indicators identified through univariate logistic analysis (p< 0. 15), half were related to milking practices and 5 were underlined by significant odds-ratios (OR) found through multivariate logistic analysis (p< 0. 05). Therefore, it was found that cubicle housing had the least risk (OR= 0. 59 compared with tightened stalls, OR= 0. 42 compared with straw stalls); Presence of a <b>calving</b> <b>pen</b> (OR= 0. 40), use of post-dipping (OR= 0. 50) had a positive impact; whereas pre-dip had a negative impact in our study (OR= 3) though it was not clear if this routine was performed correctly. Stripping also had a bad impact on milk quality whether it was systematic (OR = 1. 90) or occasional (OR = 2. 43). It was also found that farms with poor milking liner hygiene had more trouble (OR = 2. 34). The results were comparable to other ecopathological studies such as northern and southern American and European studies. This study is a prerequisite in operational veterinary advice in southern Belgium dairy farms, because it provides a cross-sectional study of dairy practices and states on major epidemiological risk factors in dairy management for this region.

In both {{years of the}} study, E. coli O 157 :H 7 was isolated from the faeces of cows shortly after but not before parturition in late winter: 6 / 38 (16 %) in 1996 and 13 / 50 (26 %) in 1997. At < 1 week post-partum, 13 / 52 (25 %) calves born in 1997 were shedding the organism. Faecal shedding of E. coli O 157 :H 7 by cows and calves continued over the 7 weeks {{that they were in}} the <b>calving</b> <b>pens,</b> with the organism being isolated from the faeces of 2 - 18 % of cows and 23 - 26 % of calves during this period. Five weeks after they were moved onto a native grass pasture, all the calves and all but one cow in 1997 had ceased shedding the organism. When the calves were weaned in the fall, E. coli O 157 :H 7 was isolated from the faeces of 0 - 1. 5 % of the calves 1 week prior to weaning and from 6 - 14 % of the calves within 2 weeks after weaning.

40|$|Management during calving is {{important}} for the health and survival of dairy cows and their calves. Although the expected calving date is known, this information is imprecise and farmers still have to check a cow regularly to identify when it starts calving. A sensor system that predicts the moment of calving could help farmers efficiently check cows for calving. Observation of a cow prior to calving {{is important}} because dystocia can occur, which requires timely intervention to mitigate adverse effects on both cow and calf. In this study, 400 cows on a Dutch dairy farm were equipped with sensors. The sensor was a single device in an ear tag, which synthesised cumulative activity, rumination activity, feeding activity, and temperature on an hourly basis. Data were collected during a one-year period. During this period, the starting moment of 417 calvings was recorded using camera images of the <b>calving</b> <b>pen</b> taken every 5 min. In total, 114 calving moments could be linked with sensor data. The moment at which calving started was defined as the first camera snapshot with visible evidence that the cow was having contractions or had started labor. Two logit models were developed: a model with the expected calving date as independent variable and a model with additional independent variables based on sensor data. The areas under the curves of the Receiver Operating Characteristic were 0. 885 and 0. 929 for these models, respectively. The model with expected calving date only had a sensitivity of 9. 1 %, whereas the model with additional sensor data has a sensitivity of 36. 4 %, both with a fixed false positive rate of 1 %. Results indicate that the inclusion of sensor data improves the prediction of the start of calving; therefore the sensor data has value for the prediction of the moment of calving. The model with the expected calving date and sensor data had a sensitivity of 21. 2 % at a one-hour time window and 42. 4 % at a three-hour time window, both with a false positive rate of 1 %. This indicates that prediction of the specific hour in which calving started was not possible with a high accuracy. The inclusion of sensor data improves the accuracy of a prediction of the start of calving, compared to a prediction based only on the expected calving date. Farmers can use the alerts of the predictive model as an indication that cows should be supervised more closely in the next hours. </p...|$|E
40|$|On {{dairy farms}} the {{tradition}} are {{to take the}} calf away from its mother directly after birth and bucket feed it. This model often leads to abnormal behaviours of the calves. To make the environment for the animals better {{and to ensure that}} the consumers get a product that is produced in an ethical way, the calves could be allowed to suckle. This work includes a summary of literature that deals with natural behaviour of cattle and effects of allowing the calf to suckle. It also includes own studies made on Ekenäs ecological farm, near Flen, where they allowed the dairy calves suckle. The calves suckle their own dam for the first three weeks and thereafter unfamiliar cows up to ten weeks of age. The studies were made during the autumn 1995. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe how the cows and calves behaved in this system and its effects on growth, udder health and milk production, identify problems and suggest changes. Behavioural observations were made on six calves and their damd during the first and the 12 :th day after they were moved from their individual <b>calving</b> <b>pen</b> to the early lacting cow group (HG) in the uninsolated barn. After three weeks together with their own dam in the HG the calve was separated from its mother and moved to a group of cows that were in the end of their lactation (LG). The calves were studied the first and 7 :th day in this group. The calves were weighed regularly and their mothers were control milked during the period. In HG almost every suckling was in the opposite parallel position. They suckled on average 6, 25 times/ 19 h and each suckling bout lasted on average 6, 4 min. In HG the dam initiated more suckling bouts than did the calf but the calves terminated more suckling bouts. In LG the calves suckled 9, 8 times/ 19 h and the calves initiated all of the suckling bouts. When the suckling bout ended it was difficult to see if it was the aggression of the cow that finally got the intended effect or if the calf was satisfied The number of attempts (initiations that never led to a suckling bout) was higher in LG than in HG and more of them ended because of the cows aggressive behaviour against the calf. In HG there was only one cross-suckling (the calf suckled an alien cow) and that lasted only for 4 minutes. In LG the calves suckled on several cows. The cows produced on average 11, 1 l/ day when the calves were together with them and suckled and 19, 5 l/day after the separation. The daily weight gain of the calves was 627 g in HG and 854 g in LG. The conclusions of the study is that it was peaceful in HG but very restless in LG therfore it is suggested to have all lactating cows in one group resulting in that the calves can suckle the dam until weaning. In this way there would be less transfer of animals, more peaceful groups and less disturbed suckling bouts...|$|E

It evidenced statistical differences (P< 0, 001) among the groups. A and B Groups showed ADWG higher than that recorded in the ‘overcrowded’ Group C. Furthermore, all the calves were graded into 1 st and 2 nd commercial categories, during the last weight recording, to achieve an in vivo quality assessment. Commercial grading showed more 1 st quality-calves in A and B Groups (9 and 8 respectively) than in Group C, where only four animals were graded as 1 st category (P< 0. 05). Finally, conditioned pathology rate was higher in Group C. As a result, it could be significant for production increase to respect the minimum space-allowance, also considering 91 / 629 /EEC directive...|$|R
30|$|Approximately 10  ml {{amount of}} blood was taken aseptically from the jugular vein of each animal using plain vacutainer tubes and needles. Sera were kept at − 20  °C in Alage ATVET animal health {{laboratory}} until serological tests were conducted. A questionnaire survey with open and closed questions was used amongst the owners whose animals were tested. The questions were specifically designed to get information from the animal owners and farm owners. The following data was collected on animal attributes: breed, sex, age, and reproductive status, stage of lactation, calving intervals and number of service per conception. Based on its biological relevance, age was stratified into three categories such as: 0.5 – 3, 3 – 6, and > 6  years. The reproductive status was also categorized as heifer, pregnant, lactating and dry. Besides, information on farms such as: hygienic practices, herd size, and other managemental factors were collected. The presence of <b>calving</b> <b>pens,</b> waste (placenta, aborted material and dead animal) disposal methods was categorized into burying, open dump or feeding to dogs. Hygienic status of the farms was categorized as clean and not clean based on manure disposal, drainage and barn ventilation. Information about cause, symptoms, mode of transmission, prevention, and treatment was also collected to assess the awareness level of the farmers. Farmer’s knowledge on brucellosis was assessed using twelve closed ended questions which were then reduced to five items using principal component analysis. The {{internal consistency of the}} variables were also checked (cronbach’s α =  0.837). The respondents who scored above the mean rank were considered as having good knowledge about brucellosis and below mean rank were regarded as having poor knowledge.|$|R

40|$|AbstractImportance of the {{dry period}} with respect to {{mastitis}} control is now well established although the precise interventions that {{reduce the risk of}} acquiring intramammary infections during this time are not clearly understood. There are very few intervention studies that have measured the clinical efficacy of specific mastitis interventions within a cost-effectiveness framework so there remains a large degree of uncertainty about the impact of a specific intervention and its costeffectiveness. The aim {{of this study was to}} use a Bayesian framework to investigate the cost-effectiveness of mastitis controls during the dry period. Data were assimilated from 77 UK dairy farms that participated in a British national mastitis control programme during 2009 – 2012 in which the majority of intramammary infections were acquired during the dry period. The data consisted of clinical mastitis (CM) and somatic cell count (SCC) records, herd management practices and details of interventions that were implemented by the farmer as part of the control plan. The outcomes used to measure the effectiveness of the interventions were i) changes in the incidence rate of clinical mastitis during the first 30 days after calving and ii) the rate at which cows gained new infections during the dry period (measured by SCC changes across the dry period from 200, 000 cells/ml). A Bayesian one-step microsimulation model was constructed such that posterior predictions from the model incorporated uncertainty in all parameters. The incremental net benefit was calculated across 10, 000 Markov chain Monte Carlo iterations, to estimate the cost-benefit (and associated uncertainty) of each mastitis intervention. Interventions identified as being cost-effective in most circumstances included selecting dry-cow therapy at the cow level, dry-cow rations formulated by a qualified nutritionist, use of individual <b>calving</b> <b>pens,</b> first milking cows within 24 h of calving and spreading bedding evenly in dry-cow yards. The results of this study highlighted the efficacy of specific mastitis interventions in UK conditions which, when incorporated into a costeffectiveness framework, can be used to optimize decision making in mastitis control. This intervention study provides an example of how an intuitive and clinically useful Bayesian approach can be used to form the basis of an on-farm decision support tool...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the prevalence of antibodies against Leptospira spp and their geographic distribution and to identify the risk factors associated with this disease in cattle herds with reproductive activity in the state of Paraná. A total of 14 163 females aged ? 24 months originating from 1 926 herds that were not vaccinated against Leptospira spp were evaluated. To detect the Leptospira spp antibodies, all serum samples were submitted for a microscopic serum-agglutination test (MAT). An epidemiological questionnaire was performed at each farm visited to characterize the management practices and study the risk factors associated with the presence or absence of Leptospira spp. To perform geoprocessing, the geographical coordinates of each farm were recorded with a Global Positioning System (GPS), which were then used to create a map. The apparent prevalence of bovine leptospirosis in the herds was the parameter used to generate the final risk map. The apparent prevalences of seropositivity in the herds and animals in Paraná state were 54. 28 %(95 %CI: 52. 05 - 56. 51) and 37. 70 %(95 %CI: 34. 54 - 40. 86), respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the risk factors associated with leptospirosis due to any serovar were the rental of grazing areas [OR= 1. 91 (1. 36 - 2. 68) ], presence of horses [OR= 1. 59 (1. 28 - 1. 97) ], presence of > 20 females ? 24 months of age [OR= 2. 25 (1. 46 - 3. 49) ], presence of > 49 bovines [OR= 2. 78 (1. 82 - 4. 26) ], purchase of animals for reproduction [OR= 1. 96 (1. 59 - 2. 41) ] and presence of <b>calving</b> <b>pens</b> [OR= 1. 32 (1. 04 - 1. 68) ]. Risk factors for leptospirosis due specifically to serovar Hardjo were the presence of > 49 bovines [OR= 3. 05 (1. 94 - 4. 80) ], presence of > 20 females ? 24 months [OR= 2. 38 (1. 50 - 3. 79) ], presence of horses [OR= 1. 87 (1. 45 - 2. 43) ], purchase of animals for reproduction [OR= 2. 14 (1. 68 - 2. 72) ] and rental of grazing areas [OR= 2. 22 (1. 54 - 3. 21) ]. Geographically, seropositivity to Leptospira spp by MAT identified the regions North/Northwest and Southwest in the state as the areas with a higher risk of disease occurrence. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} how rearing techniques that improve veal calf welfare affect growth performance and carcass and meat quality, by comparing both traditional rearing in individual stalls with group rearing in collective pens and exclusive milk feeding with maize grain supplementation. Eighty male calves were raised from 60 days-of-age (live weight 76. 465. 5 kg) until slaughter (at 182 and 189 days-of-age). Both group rearing and maize grain supplementation significantly improved growth performance (final live weight: 17 kg in group-reared calves compared to individually reared calves; and 110 kg in maize-supplemented calves compared to exclusively milk-fed calves) and carcass conformation, with {{no differences in}} dressing percentage. Group rearing increased blood packed cell volume value. Neither the type of housing nor the feeding system significantly modified carcass or meat colour or the main physical and sensory traits of the meat. Carcass fatness and meat ether extract concentration {{were higher in the}} calves reared in individual stalls or supplemented with maize grain. Our results suggest that rearing veal <b>calves</b> in <b>pens</b> and providing solid feed supplements may improve growth performance without impairing carcass and meat quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate possible effects of environmental enrichment on the behaviour and extent of coat contamination of beef calves. In total, 180 Holstein beef calves were followed for a period of 20 weeks from the age of two weeks. Feeding ration and housing conditions were similar for all calves. After arriving on the farm, calves were given an adaptation period of four weeks. After this period, they were divided into three groups: pen with Jolly Ball™ (10 pens), pen with cattle brush (10 pens) and barren pen (control group) (10 pens). Each <b>pen</b> housed 6 <b>calves.</b> Jolly Balls™ were hung at an altitude of 1. 3 m, in the middle of the pen. Cattle brushes were attached to the pen wall at an altitude of 1. 2 m. Behavioural observations were carried out two days a week, according to a scan sample method. All observations were performed by the same observer and the ethogram used was based on existing literature. Next to behaviour, the extent of coat contamination of the calves was scored three times throughout the study. Data were analysed using the statistical software program SAS 9. 3. Behavioural data lacked normality and were therefore analysed using a logistic mixed model. Contamination data were analyzed using a Fisher’s Exact Test. Behavioural results indicate that calves of the control group, without environmental enrichment, lied down more than calves in the enriched pens (P < 0. 0001). They also ran (P < 0. 0001) and jumped around (P < 0. 0001) less than the other calves. Results also revealed a difference in social behaviour; animals in enriched pens displayed more social behaviour (P < 0. 0001) than <b>calves</b> in non-enriched <b>pens.</b> There were also differences between the different forms of enrichment. In pens with a cattle brush, animals self-groomed less (P = 0. 0004) than those in control or Jolly Ball™-pens. However, there was no difference in playing behaviour between calves with the cattle brush or the Jolly Ball™. Results also indicated no association between treatment groups concerning extent of coat contamination. As a conclusion, environmental enrichment in the form of Jolly Balls™ or cattle brushes did not influence the extent of coat contamination of beef calves but did have a positive influence on their behaviour. <b>Calves</b> in enriched <b>pens</b> displayed more playing and social behavior compared to <b>calves</b> in non-enriched <b>pens.</b> The two forms of enrichment tested in this study both equally induced play behaviour in calves, so both forms can be applied successfully to enrich the otherwise barren environment of beef calves. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Clinical SciencesDaniel Ulan ThomsonConsulting veterinarians (CV; n= 23) {{representing}} 11, 295, 000 head {{of cattle}} on feed in the United States and Canada participated in a beef cattle health and well-being recommendation survey. Veterinarians were directed to an online survey to answer feeder cattle husbandry, health and preventative medicine recommendation questions. The CV visited their feedyards 1. 7 times per month. All CV train employees on cattle handling and pen riding while only 13 % of CV speak Spanish. All CV recommend IBR and BVD vaccination for high-risk (HR) calves at processing. Other vaccines were not recommended as frequently by CV. Autogenous bacterins were recommended by 39. 1 % CV for HR cattle. Metaphylaxis and feed-grade antibiotics were recommended by 95 % and 52 % of CV, respectively, for HR calves. Banding was more frequently recommended than surgical castration as calf body weight increased. The CV recommended starting HR <b>calves</b> in smaller <b>pens</b> (103 hd/pen) and allowing 13 inches/hd of bunk space. The CV indicated feedlots need to employ one feedlot doctor per 7, 083 hd of HR <b>calves</b> and one <b>pen</b> rider per 2, 739 hd of HR calves. Ancillary therapy for treating respiratory disease was recommended by 47. 8 % of CV. Vitamin C was recommended (30. 4 %) twice as often as any other ancillary therapy. Cattle health risk on arrival, weather patterns and labor availability were most important factors in predicting feedlot morbidity while metaphylactic antibiotic, therapy antibiotic and brand of vaccine were least important. This survey has provided valuable insight into feeder cattle health recommendations by CV and points to needed research areas...|$|R
40|$|Over {{a period}} of two years, growth rate and health were {{measured}} for dairy calves allowed to suckle their mothers up to 6 – 8 weeks of age. Thirty-one calves were weighted weekly, and the mean daily growth rate was 1. 2 ± 0. 03 kg from birth up to 13 weeks of age. Illness in calves and young stock was not observed. In the cows, the mean incidences of ketosis, displaced abomasum, puerperal paresis, mastitis, teat injury and retained placenta were 0, 0, 8, 22, 1 and 1 %, respectively, during a 6 -year period. The mean daily gain of 56 growing bulls was 1. 4 kg when slaughtered at 15 months of age, which is higher than the mean daily gain of 0. 95 kg in the population. Probiotics, hormones and vaccines were not used, and antibiotics were only used for treating illness. The present study indicates many advantages and few problems when dairy <b>calves</b> are <b>penned</b> together with the cows and allowed natural feeding up to 6 – 8 weeks of age. This production system was easy to manage, preferred by the farmer, and may satisfy the public concern regarding the practice of immediate separation of cow and calf in commercial milk production...|$|R
