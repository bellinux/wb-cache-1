5|$|Due to {{the fact}} that it is not a genetic ability and thus is very rare, the Rinnegan has been {{regarded}} as a legend with only the Sage of Six Paths known to acquire it. However, the reincarnations of Hagoromo's sons, Indra and Asura, can potentially access Rinnegan by having the genes of both reincarnations, as in the case of Madara (Indra's reincarnation), who obtained the DNA of Hashirama (Asura's reincarnation), although he only awoke the Rinnegan near the end of his natural lifespan. This is considered a wrongful act by Hagoromo as he attempted to leave a message in the form of a stone tablet for Indra's descendants to reconsider the act. The Rinnegan is shown to be transplantable, as Madara was able to implant his Rinnegan into the young Nagato, and Obito takes up Madara's left Rinnegan to use it in conjunction with his Sharingan. After meeting with Hagoromo, Sasuke, who is the current reincarnation of Indra, awakens a Rinnegan in his left eye, which has an additional six tomoe on top of the ripple pattern, making it closer to the Rinne Sharingan in appearance. His Rinnegan allows him to perform , which can shift himself, others, and objects a set distance away from his original location. He can increase the range of this technique by instantaneously changing place with a remote space. Due to its speed, this technique has proven to be especially useful for launching surprise attacks against enemies within its range. While there is no prerequisite for using the technique, it does have a recharging period after each use. Once fully mastered it can even <b>cross</b> <b>dimensions</b> but requires a large amount of chakra and drains his dōjutsu of its power for an extended period of time.|$|E

He is stated to be a direct descendant of the powerful sorcerer Clow Reed by the witch Yūko Ichihara who opposes him. Though he already possesses the power to <b>cross</b> <b>dimensions</b> to transport Syaoran to different worlds like Sakura, he seeks to increase the power of Sakura to revive Yūko who was kept on the brink of death and her time being frozen by Clow, and thus claim himself Clow's superior.

50|$|Gambit was {{temporarily}} given the full strength and potential of his mutant abilities to battle his counterpart New Son. At his full strength and power, Gambit can control {{all aspects of}} kinetic energy down even to the molecular level, allowing him to manipulate the potency of his bio-kinetic energy to burn, cause molecular discomfort, incinerate, create timed detonations (and manipulate the potency of the energy release), fire energy blasts, defy gravity, heal wounds, charge objects within his line of sight without contact, and effectively exist as an energy being. Under such conditions, he holds sufficient power to cause another being to be unable to move—or unable to stop if in motion. He {{has been able to}} cause or simulate various energies by manipulating the kinetic energy present, such as infrared and microwaves, by increasing molecular agitation, or cold by reducing it. He was also able to use his powers to travel through space-time, <b>cross</b> <b>dimensions,</b> and remake realities outside of space-time by transforming himself into living energy which joined with the kinetic flow. Finally, Gambit was able to heal himself by stimulating his cellular activity. These enhanced powers were burnt out after fighting New Son, and Gambit has since returned to his original, somewhat lower power levels.. However, after Sage jumpstarted his powers again, he was able to heal his blinded eyes—thus implying he is again able to heal himself—and is also able again to charge living things with energy, as when he teamed up with Sebastian Shaw to destroy Mr. Sinister's machines. He was also given another boost when he was killed in an altercation with a drug lord and Faiza Hussain managed to restore him before it set it, enabling him to charge a bullet with twice as much explosive force than usual.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the flexural failure probability of steel reinforced concrete beams. The flexural failure probability of steel reinforced concrete beams is determined by the Monte Carlo technique in this paper.
