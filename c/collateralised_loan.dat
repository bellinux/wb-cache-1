40|$|The {{following}} descriptive paper {{surveys the}} various types of loan securitisation and provides a working definition of so-called <b>collateralised</b> <b>loan</b> obligations (CLOs). Free of the common rhetoric and slogans, which sometimes substitute for understanding of the complex nature of structured finance, this paper describes the theoretical foundations of this specialised form of loan securitisation. Not only the distinctive properties of CLOs but also the information economics inherent in the transfer of credit risk will be considered, such that we can come to see the critical aspects of security design in the structuring of CLO transactions...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} model to price and hedge basket credit {{derivatives}} and <b>collateralised</b> <b>loan</b> obligation. Based upon the copula-approach by Schonbucher and Schubert (2001) the model allows a specification of the joint dynamics of credit spreads and default intensities, including a specification of the infection dynamics which cause credit spreads to widen at defaults of other obligors. Because of {{a high degree of}} analytical tractability, joint default and survival probabilities and also sensitivities can be given in closed-form which facilitates the development of hedging strategies based upon the model. The model uses a generalisation of the class of Archimedean copula functions which gives rise to more realistic credit spread dynamics than the Gaussian copula or the Student-t-copula which are usually chosen in practice. An example specification using Gamma-distributed factors is provided...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{financial}} crisis the Eurosystem (the ECB and the National Central Banks (NCBs) of the 16 Euro Area member states) have greatly expanded both the scope of their actions {{and the size of}} their balance sheets. NCBs have conducted lender-of-last resort actions for their governments’ accounts. The ECB has massively expanded the range of securities that are acceptable as collateral in the repos and other <b>collateralised</b> <b>loan</b> transactions done by the NCBs. It has participated in currency swaps with other governments and provided repo facilities to non-Euro Area countries such as Hungary. On 9 May 2010, it announced that it would purchase Euro Area government bonds outright in secondary markets as part of {{the financial}} support scheme for heavily indebted Euro Area countries. In acting as a lender of last resort, or otherwise intervening in financial markets, the Eurosystem is taking on risk and redistributing income. Allowing an independent and unelected body to have such a political role is only palatable in a democracy if the institution is viewed as legitimate...|$|E
50|$|Owing to {{alternative}} ways of <b>collateralising</b> <b>loans,</b> such as using larger groups of guarantors, many good projects rejected by normal banks have materialised. The bank is also active in the public debate, offering information about alternatives to mainstream economic thought.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the Fed, the ECB normally does not buy bonds outright. The normal procedure used by the ECB for manipulating the money supply has been via the so-called refinancing facilities. In these facilities, bonds are not purchased but used in reverse transactions: repurchase agreements, or <b>collateralised</b> <b>loans.</b> These two transactions are similar, i.e. bonds are used as collaterals for loans, the difference being of legal nature. In the repos the ownership of the collateral changes to the ECB until the loan is repaid.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the {{determinants of}} the probability of default (PD) of bank loans. We focus the discussion {{on the role of}} a limited set of variables (collateral, type of lender and bank borrower relationship) while controlling for the other explanatory variables. The study uses information on the more than three million loans entered into by Spanish credit institutions over a complete business cycle (1988 to 2000) collected by the Bank of Spain's Credit Register (Central de Información de Riesgos). We find that <b>collateralised</b> <b>loans</b> have a higher PD, loans granted by savings banks are riskier and, finally, that a close bank borrower relationship increases the willingness to take more risk. credit risk, probability of default, collateral, relationship banking, credit register...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} overnight (O/N) interest rates which constitute {{the short end}} of the yield curve and the factors which have an impact on such rates. The MNB, unlike several other central banks, does not have a direct overnight interest rate target; it does, however, limit the divergence of O/N interest rates from its policy rate with the settings of its operational framework. First, the MNB’s regulations on compulsory reserves allow banks to apply averaging in the reserve maintenance period, which reduces overnight interest rate volatility. Second, the interest rate corridor – determined by MNB’s <b>collateralised</b> <b>loan</b> and deposit – limits the maximum fluctuation band of overnight interbank interest rates. The study finds that the role of reserve averaging to reduce yield fluctuations is imperfect, as a clear seasonal pattern is observed in the intra-maintenance period evolution of overnight rates. The frequency of cumulative front-loading and excess reserves is significantly higher than the frequency of reserve deficit. Therefore, the level of overnight interest rates tends to remain below the policy rate and drop towards the interest rates of overnight central bank deposits {{at the end of the}} maintenance period. Moreover, statistical analysis finds evidence that the impact of liquidity withdrawing shocks are typically greater – approximately twice as much – as of those injecting liquidity. This phenomenon could be explained by the volatility of autonomous liquidity factors, especially that of the government accounts, which is particularly high on VAT payment days. Institutional settings (credit limits, limitation of maximum deviation from reserve requirements, high interbank concentration) curtail the potential of the interbank market to efficiently distribute liquidity over the entire system, which may also explain the asymmetric liquidity management characteristics of Hungarian banks. overnight rate, central bank instruments, operational framework, averaging, reserve requirements. ...|$|E
40|$|If a {{borrower}} defaults on a loan, a bank’s recovery {{may depend}} {{on the value of}} the loan collateral. The value of collateral, like the value of other assets, fluctuates with economic conditions. If the economy experiences a downturn, a bank can experience a double misfortune: many obligors default, and the value of collateral is damaged. Conventional credit models overlook the effect of economic conditions on collateral. They allow default to vary from year to year, but they hold fixed the average value of collateral and the average level of recovery. The distinctive feature of the credit model presented here is that an economic downturn causes damage to the value of collateral. When systematic collateral damage enters the credit model, the capital allocated to a highly <b>collateralised</b> <b>loan</b> can double or triple. 1 Taking collateral damage into account complicates a credit capital model. However, the results of the model can be well approximated by a function of expected loss alone. Expected loss can therefore be used as the basis of a credit capital estimate. This estimate is simpler, and can be more accurate than using the results of a conventional credit model that ignores the role of collateral damage. Credit capital model The credit capital model uses the conditional approach suggested by Finger (1999) and Gordy (2000). The variables in the model depend on a systematic risk factor, a random variable representing the good years and bad years of the economy. The co-variation between two variables stems from their mutual dependence on the systematic factor. Two variables that relate strongly to the systematic factor relate strongly to each other and therefore have a strong correlation. Exposure of $ 1 is assumed to each obligor j. At the end of a one-year analysis horizon, the value of collateral is a random number characterised by three positive parameters: its amount, mj; its volatility, sj; and its sensitivity to X, the systematic risk factor, also known as its “loading”, qj: Collateral = µ 1 + σ...|$|E
40|$|Microfinance (small scale {{lending to}} the poor) is {{integrated}} into a dynamic macroeconomic model of income distribution. Two-period-lived agents, belonging to overlapping generation of dynastic families, choose between three alternative occupations - subsistence production, small-scale project investment and large-scale project investment. Subsistence activity is costless and riskless, whilst project investment is the opposite and may require external funding from financial institutions with imperfect powers of contract enforcement. In the absence of microfinance, only large-scale, <b>collateralised</b> <b>loans</b> are available through the traditional banking sector. Under such circumstances, initial inequalities persist as only the wealthy are able to acquire these loans, and as the small-scale enterprise is either not feasible or not profitable. With the introduction of microfinance, this venture is made both possible and attractive through the provision of non-collateralised loans and other features of microlending arrangements. Poverty and inequality are reduced as a result. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this {{research}} was to determine the risks and the rewards of providing reverse factoring as a financing technology for small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) in South Africa. There {{have been a number of}} financing technologies provided to SMEs in South Africa and reverse factoring has not been taken advantage of. The financing technologies that have been offered range from trade credit, to <b>collateralised</b> <b>loans,</b> overdraft facilities, etc. Most if not all of these technologies are based on some form of security which is usually the SME’s immovable assets. This research project contributes to the body of knowledge that deals with SME finance. A survey was done to find out the views of SME owners, procurement managers, finance managers and financiers concerning the risks and rewards of providing reverse factoring to SMEs. Ten propositions were formulated. A qualitative research methodology, using semi-structured interviews was used to rate the risks and rewards associated with providing reverse factoring. The results showed that the rewards far outweigh the risks by a ratio of 1 : 0. 6. For reverse factoring as a financing technology this is positive and is worth pursuing. The risks of lack of collateral and the risk of fraudulent invoices are the most prevalent. A boost in economic activity in the SME space and the provision of much needed liquidity were the most noted rewards of providing reverse factoring to SMEs in South Africa.

40|$|Under the {{framework}} of Basel II, banks which adopt the internal ratings-based approach {{will be required to}} compare their actual provisions with expected losses. Any shortfall (i. e., the expected loss exceeds the provision) should be deducted from capital of the bank. It is therefore important to ensure banks make adequate provisions against expected losses. In addition, both sound policy and the Banking Ordinance require banks to take a forward-looking view of provisions. These requirements raise the issue of how to determine an adequate level of provisions in response to changing market conditions, in particular requiring adequate provisions from an expected-loss perspective. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to employ a simple model for measuring provisions for <b>collateralised</b> <b>loans.</b> The collateral value and the probabilities of default (PD) of borrowers are the two correlated input variables in the model. The model incorporates forward-looking elements including volatility of the collateral value and correlation between the collateral value and the PD into the measured provisions. The model can be readily extended to measuring provisions for loans without collateral provided that the expected values and volatility of the loans' recovery rates can be estimated. Some calculations of provisions with different loan-to-value ratios and one-year PD are presented for illustrative purposes. For example, using the classified-loan ratio of 1. 49 % as at September 2005 as a proxy of the PD and the loan-to-value ratio of 180 % (which corresponds to the loss-given-default of about 45 %), the provision for loans is about 0. 66 % of the outstanding loan value. Promotion of forward-looking provisions in assessments of risk can obviate the need for large increases in provisions when the economy is in recession. This means that procyclicality of lending would be reduced to some extent. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} asset backed {{securities}} and the pricing thereof. First, an overview of debt markets is provided with a particular focus on the recent crisis in the sub prime markets. Second, literature surrounding securitization, {{asset backed securities}} and related types of debt is analysed and discussed. A revised pricing model for asset backed securities based on two existing models (Ebrahim, 2000; Ebrahim & Ahmed, 2007) is successively developed and implemented in Maple programming language. This model assumes access to symmetric information and provides optimum pricing for securities backed by a deprecating asset while <b>collateralising</b> the <b>loan</b> with the underlying asset and the income of the borrower. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed on the model, the results are analysed and conclusions drawn. Further extensions to the model are suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{health of}} a firm’s balance sheet {{potentially}} {{plays a role in}} its decisions to invest and through that channel, aggregate activity can be affected. Several authors have established a theoretical link based on the notion that the value of equity can be <b>collateralised</b> for business <b>loans</b> used to fund capital accumulation. In some of these models, it is possible to demonstrate that there is a financial accelerator that can amplify the business cycle by more than what could be explained by, for instance, an interest rate channel. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{catalyst}} of {{the current}} financial turmoil has been the losses on the subprime mortgage market. However, the low quality of these partly <b>collateralised</b> housing <b>loans</b> was known {{for a while and}} the default on subprime mortgages largely expected. Therefore, how to account for the fact that an expected shock on a small segment of the US mortgage market turned into a major financial crisis, causing the near-collapse of the Commercial Paper and of the interbank lending markets, that is to say of two of the most liquid financial markets? Banks have transferred risks to special entities, the so-called “conduits”, SIV (Special Investment Vehicles) and SPV (Special Purpose Vehicles). Such a practice gave the false impression that credit risk was transferred from banks outside the financial system. This was indeed not the case. The funding needs associated in particular with backup lines of credit for off-balance sheet vehicles generated pressures on the the interbank markets and led central banks to massively intervene. The roots {{of the current}} turmoil are therefore of a deeper and structural nature. For that reason, it is necessary to assess, from a longer term perspective, what are the main consequences of the recent structural changes on financial markets {{in order to have a}} good grasp on the current financial market dynamics and clarify what is meant nowadays by liquidity. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple model {{for measuring the}} provision for a pool of <b>collateralised</b> retail <b>loans</b> with homogenous characteristics (i. e. {{the same type of}} collateral and broadly the same loan-to-value ratio) due to default, where the collateral coverage is treated as a put option with the strike price equal to the outstanding loan amount of the pool. The collateral value and the probabilities of default (PD) of borrowers in the pool are the two correlated stochastic variables in the model. Empirical findings based on the data of the residential mortgage market in Hong Kong are consistent with the proposed dynamics of the PD of residential mortgage loans, which reverts to a mean level. The numerical results show that the loan-to-value ratio, correlation between the property price and the PD, volatility of the property price, mean-reverting process of the PD and time horizon are the important factors for measuring provisions. These factors incorporate forward-looking elements, which are however not fully considered in the Basel II framework. The model can be used for assessing whether provisions provided by banks against expected loss are adequate in a forward-looking view, as required by both sound policy and the Banking Ordinance. Promotion of forward-looking provisions with longer time horizons in assessments of risk can also avoid large increases in provisions until the economy is clearly in recession. This means that procyclicality of lending would be reduced to some extent. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to UK Mortgage Performance Modelling. The {{research}} conducted uses an option pricing methodology to model theoretically the value of Mortgages, the Option to default and the probability to default and to compare the predictive accuracy of the latter with the predictive accuracy of data driven credit-scoring techniques. Theoretical models are constructed to represent the life cycles of <b>loans</b> <b>collateralised</b> by real property operating within a stochastic economic environment of house-price and interest rate. These realistic mortgage models provide a confirmation of recent research based upon a relaxation of the assumption of financially rational, 'ruthless' prepayment, bridge a potential oversight in existing research by an extension of existing modelling in the stochastic behaviour of the house price process and present {{a proposal for a}} straightforward approach utilising characteristic measures of borrower delinquency and insolvency that enables estimation of the default probabilities implicit in residential mortgages using a simple but enhanced optimising structural model. This model straightforwardly demonstrates that one can predict the probability of eventual default, beginning at the origination of the loan, the time when a lender would be most interested in making such a determination. Secondly the problem of mortgage loan default risk is empirically assessed {{in a number of different}} ways focusing upon analysis of the competing risks of early termination, the inclusion of macro-economic variables - time varying covariates and unobserved borrower heterogeneity. Key insight is provided by means of a multi-period model exploiting the potential of the survival analysis approach when both loan survival times and the various regressors are measured at discrete points in time. The discrete-time hazard model is used as an empirical framework for analysing the deterioration process leading to loan default and as a tool for prediction of the same event. Results show that the prediction accuracy of the duration model is better than that provided by a single period logistic model. The predictive power of the discrete time survival analysis is enhanced when it is extended to allow for unobserved individual heterogeneity (frailty) ...|$|R
