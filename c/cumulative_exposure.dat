5|$|Exposure to lead {{may also}} {{decrease}} lifespan and have health {{effects in the}} long term. Death rates {{from a variety of}} causes {{have been found to be}} higher in people with elevated blood lead levels; these include cancer, stroke, and heart disease, and general death rates from all causes. Lead is considered a possible human carcinogen based on evidence from animal studies. Evidence also suggests that age-related mental decline and psychiatric symptoms are correlated with lead exposure. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>exposure</b> over a prolonged period may have a more important effect on some aspects of health than recent exposure.

5|$|Blood {{lead levels}} are an {{indicator}} mainly of recent or current lead exposure, not of total body burden. Lead in bones {{can be measured}} noninvasively by X-ray fluorescence; {{this may be the}} best measure of <b>cumulative</b> <b>exposure</b> and total body burden. However this method is not widely available and is mainly used for research rather than routine diagnosis. Another radiographic sign of elevated lead levels is the presence of radiodense lines called lead lines at the metaphysis in the long bones of growing children, especially around the knees. These lead lines, caused by increased calcification due to disrupted metabolism in the growing bones, become wider as the duration of lead exposure increases. X-rays may also reveal lead-containing foreign materials such as paint chips in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. To {{evaluate}} if <b>cumulative</b> weight <b>exposure</b> {{is associated}} with weight loss strategy choices and weight loss success. Methods. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used; a total of 4, 562 people age 50 years or older who reported {{trying to lose weight}} in the last year were studied. <b>Cumulative</b> weight <b>exposure</b> (CWE) score was defined as the sum of body mass index points above 25 [*]kg/m 2 at the age of 25, 10 years ago, 1 year ago, and now. Weight loss strategies were self-reported and weight loss success was defined as reaching a 5 % weight loss in the last year. Results. Chosen strategies for weight loss vary across tertiles of CWE. Participants in the highest CWE tertile were about 4 to 20 times more likely to lose at least 5 % of body weight in the past year compared to those in the lowest CWE tertile (P< 0. 05). [*][*]Discussion. Strategies used to lose weight and weight loss success using different weight loss strategies vary considerably across <b>cumulative</b> weight <b>exposure.</b> Thus, <b>cumulative</b> weight <b>exposure</b> might be a variable worth considering when intervening with this population...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} <b>cumulative</b> <b>exposures</b> {{to traffic}} noise and outdoor air pollution on environmental and health related {{quality of life}} in Windsor, Ontario, and provides a critical analysis of the environmental assessment process for the Detroit River International Crossing (DRIC) Study. The research utilizes a systemic risk framework to understand environmental health and stress effects of <b>cumulative</b> <b>exposures.</b> The significance of this research is based on a relative absence of literature on the systemic health risks of <b>cumulative</b> <b>exposures</b> and the need to elucidate environmental annoyance as a health outcome for risk assessment. The objectives of the research were to (1) Demonstrate the impact of high volume traffic facilities on the noise annoyance dose-response; (2) Evaluate the effect of <b>cumulative</b> <b>exposures</b> and odour annoyance on noise annoyance; (3) Conceptualize and test a model for annoyance as a health outcome of multiple exposures, and; (4) Critically appraise the capacity of environmental impact assessment to address environmental health in megaproject planning. Data from a community survey (n= 610) in 2013 were combined with spatial data exposures to traffic noise and ambient nitrogen dioxide. Bivariate analyses, multivariate regression and structural equation modeling were used for the quantitative analysis. Document and media analyses were used to construct stakeholder discourses on environmental health and risk perceptions of relevance to the DRIC Study. The results of an ordinal location-scale model used to predict noise annoyance demonstrated a dose-response effect of noise, significant interactions between noise and air pollution, and a strong confounding effect of odour annoyance. A structural equation model for environmental and health related {{quality of life in}}dicated that noise annoyance had a negative impact on functional mental and physical health, and that odour annoyance and levels of co-exposure were important covariates. The results of the quantitative analysis corresponded with community discourses on environmental health during the DRIC Study. Further analysis showed that the environmental assessment process obfuscated community health risks and stakeholder participation, lending support to the utilization of systemic risk perspectives and integrated environmental impact health assessments in megaproject planning. The DRIC study findings were in disagreement with public perceptions and previous research that demonstrates strong contributions of border traffic to air pollution and significant associations between air pollution and health in Windsor. The results of this thesis complement these findings by showing that ambient stressors in Windsor and in the environmental context of the DRIC megaproject had a systemic effect on health. This provides a unique contribution to the environmental health literature on <b>cumulative</b> effects of <b>exposure</b> to environmental noise and ambient pollution. It also provides a methodological contribution to systemic health risk assessment for measuring impacts of multiple environmental exposures on health related quality of life. For future research on environmental health the results warrant explicit consideration of multiple exposures and their combined effects as ambient stressors...|$|R

Trends in prostate cancer incidence with <b>cumulative</b> PCB <b>exposure</b> were evaluated using standardized rate ratios and Cox regression models. For selected sites, <b>cumulative</b> PCB <b>exposure</b> was compared between aggressive (fatal/distant stage) and localized/regional cancers. ResultsWe identified 3, 371 invasive first primary cancer diagnoses among 21, 317 eligible workers through 2007. Overall relative incidence was reduced.
