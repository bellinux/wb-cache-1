5|$|At {{the time}} of publication, Vachss worked as an attorney, in New York City, specializing in <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> cases; {{he also had a}} career as a novelist. The duality of Vachss' work as a lawyer prosecuting and {{defending}} real cases and as a crime fiction author writing about fictional criminals resulted in Vachss being compared to the Bruce Wayne/Batman character. Vachss' eighth novel, Footsteps of the Hawk, in the Burke series featuring a vigilante private investigator of <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> cases, was released just two months before the publication of Batman: The Ultimate Evil. He had wanted to approach the topic of sex tourism in southeast Asia, but had been unable to find a way for the Burke character to go there; the Batman character offered the chance for him to write about the topic.|$|E

He continued with his themes concerning child sexual abuse and explored the topic of child sex tourism. The publisher required Vachss to follow certain rules, like making a clear distinction between fiction and reality and prohibiting the Batman character from killing, cursing, or having sex.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} lifetime prevalence and characteristics of self-reported <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> and associations between <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse,</b> gender, sociodemographic data, and consensual sexual experiences. A questionnaire was completed by 4, 339 Swedish high school seniors. Three categories of <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> were studied: noncontact, contact without penetration, and penetrating <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse.</b> Penetrating <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> was correlated with the most severe abuse characteristics. Students reporting <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse,</b> especially penetrating <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse,</b> were more likely to not be living with both parents, to have parents with lower socioeconomic status, and to have their first consensual intercourse at a young age.

40|$|During the 1980 s {{discourse}} concerning <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> became {{central to}} the US/UK media, and in the 1990,s popular culture frequently took <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> as a subject for representation. Numerous claims of <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> were made between 1984 and 1994, not {{all of which were}} real. Everyday news throughout the 1990 s highlighted concerns concerning abduction by paedophiles and children being at risk from predatory paedophiles using the Internet. While the media continually made <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> a central concern of public debate, popular culture, particularly films, explored this issue in fiction and docudrama. Many of these films reproduced some of the central myths concerning <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> and paedophilia. Men <b>abusing</b> <b>children,</b> women <b>abusing</b> <b>children,</b> <b>children</b> <b>abusing</b> other <b>children,</b> became staple fodder in mainstream feature films. In 2005 'the most famous person in the world' was again on trial for what is popularly considered to be the most heinous of crimes. Pervasive Perversions analyses a range of media and popular culture texts concerned with <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse.</b> With sections on new media, fiction film, and celebrity culture, key questions are examined. Why did mass hysteria break out in the 1980 s over sexual abuse and continue throughout the final decades of the twentieth century? What was the significance of this phenomenon? How have the constructions and representation of <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> in the media and popular culture altered? What do these images and narratives convey concerning the understanding of <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> in the public consciousness? How does this relate to the reality? What is the relationship between celebrity culture and <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse?</b> The author examines these questions through an extensive evaluation of all forms of media and popular culture and comprehensively unearths and demystifies the key myths of <b>child</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> in contemporary media and popular culture...|$|R
