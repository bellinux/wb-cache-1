5|$|A {{peroxidase}} enzyme {{known as}} MroAPO (Marasmius rotula aromatic peroxygenase) is attracting research interest for possible applications in biocatalysis. In general, enzymes that catalyze oxygen-transfer reactions are of great utility in chemical synthesis since they work selectively and under ambient conditions. Fungal peroxidases can catalyze oxidations {{that are difficult}} for the organic chemist, including those involving aromatic substrates such as aniline, 4-aminophenol, hydroquinone, resorcinol, <b>catechol,</b> and paracetamol. The M.rotula enzyme is the first fungal peroxygenase that can be produced in high yields. It is highly stable over a wide pH range, and {{in a variety of}} organic solvents.

40|$|Abstract Background Substituted <b>catechols</b> are {{important}} precursors for large-scale synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other industrial products. Most {{of the reported}} chemical synthesis methods are expensive and insufficient at industrial level. However, biological processes for production of substituted <b>catechols</b> could be highly selective and suitable for industrial purposes. Results We have optimized a process for bio-catalytic production of 3 -substituted <b>catechols</b> viz. 3 -nitrocatechol (3 -NC) and 3 -methylcatechol (3 -MC) at pilot scale. Amongst the screened strains, two strains viz. Pseudomonas putida strain (F 1) and recombinant Escherichia coli expression clone (pDTG 602) harboring first two genes of toluene degradation pathway were found to accumulate 3 -NC and 3 -MC respectively. Various parameters such as amount of nutrients, pH, temperature, substrate concentration, aeration, inoculums size, culture volume, toxicity of substrate and product, down stream extraction, single step and two-step biotransformation were optimized at laboratory scale to obtain high yields of 3 -substituted <b>catechols.</b> Subsequently, pilot scale studies were performed in 2. 5 liter bioreactor. The rate of product accumulation at pilot scale significantly increased up to ~ 90 - 95 % with time and high yields of 3 -NC (10 mM) and 3 -MC (12 mM) were obtained. Conclusion The biocatalytic production of 3 -substituted <b>catechols</b> viz. 3 -NC and 3 -MC depend on some crucial parameters to obtain maximum yields of the product at pilot scale. The process optimized for production of 3 -substituted <b>catechols</b> by using the organisms P. putida (F 1) and recombinant E. coli expression clone (pDTG 602) may be useful for industrial application. </p...|$|R
40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAH) are ubiquitous environmental pollutants. They are procarcinogens requiring metabolic activation to elicit their deleterious effects. Aldo-keto reductases (AKR) catalyze the oxidation of proximate carcinogenic PAH trans-dihydrodiols to yield electrophilic and redox-active PAH o-quiniones. AKRs {{are also found}} {{to be capable of}} reducing PAH o-quinones to form PAH <b>catechols.</b> The interconversion of o-quinones and <b>catechols</b> results in the redox cycling of PAH o-quinones to give rise to the generation of reactive oxygen species and subsequent oxidative DNA damage. On the other hand, PAH <b>catechols</b> can be intercepted through phase II metabolism by which PAH o-quinones could be detoxified and eliminated. The aim of the present review is to summarize the role of human AKRs in the metabolic activation/detoxication of PAH and the relevance of phase II conjugation reactions to human lung carcinogenesis...|$|R

25|$|Several {{tests can}} {{determine}} exposure to benzene. Benzene {{itself can be}} measured in breath, blood or urine, but such testing is usually limited to the first 24 hours post-exposure due to the relatively rapid removal of the chemical by exhalation or biotransformation. Most people in developed countries have measureable baseline levels of benzene and other aromatic petroleum hydrocarbons in their blood. In the body, benzene is enzymatically converted to a series of oxidation products including muconic acid, phenylmercapturic acid, phenol, <b>catechol,</b> hydroquinone and 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene. Most of these metabolites have some value as biomarkers of human exposure, since they accumulate in the urine in proportion to the extent and duration of exposure, and they may still be present for some days after exposure has ceased. The current ACGIH biological exposure limits for occupational exposure are 500 μg/g creatinine for muconic acid and 25 μg/g creatinine for phenylmercapturic acid in an end-of-shift urine specimen.|$|E

It {{is well known that}} <b>catechols</b> are also redox-active and we have observed that biomimetic catechol-modified chitosan films are redox-active and possess interesting molecular electronic properties.

Specifically, we are investigating an interactive redox-probing approach to access redox-based chemical information and convert this information into an electrical modality that facilitates analysis by methods from signal processing. In this review, we describe the broad vision and then cite recent examples in which the catechol–chitosan redox-capacitor can assist in accessing and understanding chemical information. Further, this redox-capacitor can be coupled with synthetic biology to enhance the power of chemical information processing.

25|$|Biodegradation {{can be seen}} in {{some studies}} that {{biodegradation}} accounts for the absence of creosote preservatives on the initial surface of the sediment. In a study from Pensacola, Florida, PAHs were not detected on the surface on the aquatic sediment, but the highest concentrations were detected at a depth of 8-13 centimeters. A form an anaerobic biodegradation of m-cresol was seen in a study using sulfate-reducing and nitrate-reducing enriched environments. The reduction of m-cresol in this study was seen in under 144 hours, while additional chemical intermediates were being formed. The chemical intermediates were formed in the presence of bicarbonate. The products included 4-hydroxy-2-methylbenzoic acid and acetate compounds. Although the conditions were enriched with the reducing anaerobic compounds, sulfate and nitrate reducing bacteria are commonly found in the environment. For further information, see sulfate-reducing bacteria. The type of anaerobic bacteria ultimately determines the reduction of the creosote preservative compounds, while each individual compound may only go through reduction under certain conditions. BTEX is a mixture of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene, that was studied in the presence of four different anaerobic-enriched sediments. Though the compound, BTEX, is not found in creosote preservatives, the products of creosote preservatives' oxidation-reduction reactions include some of these compounds. For oxidation-reduction reactions, see the following section. In this study, it was seen that certain compounds such as benzene were only reduced under sulfate-enriched environments, while toluene was reduced under a variety of bacteria-enriched environments, not just sulfate. The biodegradation of a creosote preservative in an anaerobic enrichment depends not only on the type of bacteria enriching the environment, but also the compound that has been released from the preservative. In aerobic environments, preservative compounds are limited in the biodegradation process by the presence of free oxygen. In an aerobic environment, free oxygen comes from oxygen saturated sediments, sources of precipitation, and plume edges. The free oxygen allows for the compounds to be oxidized and decomposed into new intermediate compounds. Studies have shown that when BTEX and PAH compounds were placed in aerobic environments, the oxidation of the ring structures caused cleavage in the aromatic ring and allowed for other functional groups to attach. When an aromatic hydrocarbon was introduced to the molecular oxygen in experimental conditions, a dihydrodiol intermediate was formed, and then oxidation occurred transforming the aromatic into a <b>catechol</b> compound. <b>Catechol</b> allows for cleavage of the aromatic ring to occur, where functional groups can then add in an ortho- or meta- position.|$|E

2500|$|The pathway for the {{metabolism}} of benzene {{is complex}} and begins in the liver. [...] Several enzymes are involved. [...] These include cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), quinine oxidoreductase (NQ01), GSH, and myeloperoxidase (MPO).

[...] In the bone marrow, MPO converts these polyphenols to benzoquinones. [...] These intermediates and metabolites induce genotoxicity by multiple mechanisms including inhibition of topoisomerase II (which maintains chromosome structure), disruption of microtubules (which maintains cellular structure and organization), generation of oxygen free radicals (unstable species) {{that may lead to}} point mutations, increasing oxidative stress, inducing DNA strand breaks, and altering DNA methylation (which can affect gene expression). [...] NQ01 and GSH shift metabolism away from toxicity. [...] NQ01 metabolizes benzoquinone toward polyphenols (counteracting the effect of MPO).

40|$|Failure in the {{processing}} of PCBs and PCB metabolites by bacterial bph pathways limits prospects for bioremediation of these notorious pollutants.

Earlier {{research has demonstrated that}} the ring-cleaving dioxygenases from other pathways succeeded in {{the processing}} of 4 -substituted <b>catechols</b> where enzymes from the bph pathway failed. This study defines a structural basis for this failure comparing the structures of ring-cleaving dioxygenases that succeed and fail in the cleavage of 4 -substituted <b>catechols.</b> DoxGC 18 is a 1, 2 -dihydroxnaphthalene dioxygenases from Pseudomonas strain C 18. BphCLB 400 is the homologous 2, 3 -dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase from the bph pathway of Burkholderia strain LB 400. DoxGC 18 cleaves 3, 4 -dihydroxybiphenyl (4 -phenylcatechol), whereas BphCLB 400 does not do so. I determined the high resolution structure of DoxGC 18 and its binary complexes with four substrates: 3, 4 -dihydroxybiphenyl, 2, 3 -dihydroxybiphenyl, 4 -methylcatechol, and 1, 2 -dihydroxynaphthalene. Comparisons to previously determined substrate complexes of BphCLB 400 revealed variations in enzyme:substate interactions and dynamic features of enzyme structure that correlate with competency for cleavage of 4 -substituted <b>catechols</b> and, presumably, related PCB metabolites. In particular, a key hydrogen bond to a histidine involved in catalysis is formed in DoxGC 18 by the side chain carboxylate of an aspartate residue, whereas in BphC LB 400 the bond is formed by the backbone carbonyl of a proline residue. Utilization of the aspartate in this hydrogen bond generates more room for the binding of 4 -substituted <b>catechols</b> and flexibility in the hydrogen bond network. This leads to ability of DoxGC 18 to degrade these substrate where BphCLB 400 fails. ...|$|R
