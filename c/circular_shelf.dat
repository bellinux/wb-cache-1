Central, within the scuttle-butt itself, stands an iron pump, which, connecting with the immense water-tanks in the hold, furnishes an unfailing supply of the much-admired Pale Ale, first brewed in the brooks of the garden of Eden, and stamped with the brand of our old father Adam, who never knew what wine was. We are indebted to the old vintner Noah for that. The scuttle-butt is the only fountain in the ship; and here alone can you drink, unless at your meals. Night and day an armed sentry paces before it, bayonet in hand, to see that no water is taken away, except according to law. I wonder that they station no sentries at the port-holes, to see that no air is breathed, except according to Navy regulations.|$|E

The bachelor thesis contains basic functional calculations, design of kinematics of material in container. Then it contains calculation requiring of achievement gearing, design of breaking and driving system. The components which are these systems made up from are chosen from catalogues of companies, which are produced. Part of the thesis is {{control of this}} system...|$|E
40|$|Surface waves {{subject to}} linear {{frictional}} force originating from horizontal bottom stresses. Wave properties for this model are deduced. Theoretical refelction and transmission coefficients {{were found for}} these waves when incident to a depth discontinuity positioned normal to the wave crests. These results were compared with experimental ones and agreement was generally good, though there was some evidence of extraneous energy losses by turbulence at the discontinuity. A <b>circular</b> <b>shelf</b> model was considered with the theoretical results showing a large reduction in the "Q" of the resonance peaks {{when compared with the}} frictionless case. It was also found that, except at the lower frequencies, a large number of overlapping resonance peaks which were out of phase with one another occupied relatively narrow frequency band. Experiments using several frequencies carried out for the circular sill model and the results were in very good agreement with the theoretical ones...|$|E

Such corner cabinets cut out {{a quarter of the}} circle to permit two [...] "doors" [...] to be mounted at right angles to one another. These are especially common in kitchen cabinets.|$|R

Some temples have <b>circular</b> revolving <b>shelves</b> for sūtra storage: a central pillar revolves, like a vertical axle, and octahedral tubes are attached to it. A revolving sūtra storage case is called rinzō (extra=wheel repository). Revolving shelves are convenient because they allow priests and monks to select the needed sūtra quickly. Eventually, in some kyōzō the faithful were permitted to push the shelves around the pillar while praying—it was believed that they could receive religious edification without reading the sūtras.|$|R

"The more {{prominent}} characters are the peculiar form, narrowed at the anterior end, the reddish or chocolate surface, smooth except for radiating folds, and the coppery red stain within the cavity of the spire. This last feature is sometimes absent. The perforations are numerous, close together and almost perfectly <b>circular.</b> The columellar <b>shelf</b> orplate slopes outward, is rather narrow and convex on its face. The shell when placed upon a plane surface, rests upon its two extremities, both lips being arched. The apex is nearer to the margin than in Haliotis midae, another Cape species, with which this one agrees in lacking spiral striation." ...|$|R
40|$|We present {{sea level}} spectra {{computed}} from bottom pressure records at two {{locations around the}} Balearic Islands. Western Mediterranean. In these spectra, several sea level oscillation peaks are observed at both sides of Mallorca Island. Moreover, the relative magnitudes {{of the first two}} peaks switch during the >rissaga> events. To understand the appearance of these modes and their changes during 'rissaga', a simple analytical model is presented for atmospheric pressure induced edge waves on a <b>circular</b> <b>shelf</b> with a circular island in the middle. The analytical solutions indicate that indeed the peaks in the observed spectra can be identified as the fundamental modes of the edge waves. The analytical solutions also confirm that the magnitude of the second peak becomes higher than the first peak only when the phase speed of the atmospheric pressure waves become almost {{the same as that of}} the long ocean wave on the Mallorca shelf. The research is also partly supported by National Science Foundation Grants to Cornell University.

40|$|Observations from a {{large number}} of seabird line-transect surveys {{conducted}} in Faroese waters are used to derive some general conclusions regarding the distribution of harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) in the region using estimates of encounter rates (no. /km- 1) in different meso-scale habitats around the Faroes during the breeding season (May-September). Based on a sub-set of the data collected during calm conditions (sea states below Beaufort 3) we analysed the distribution of harbour porpoises in relation to 5 potentially important physical parameters: water depth, distance to shore, slope of the ocean floor, distance to tidal front and Beaufort sea state. These parameters were determined from data collected during the surveys, the literature {{as well as from the}} new bathymetry established for the Faroese shelf. In order to link the differently scaled physical parameters with the encounter rates and sea states recorded during the surveys we used a suite of geo-statistical and raster-based GIS techniques based on a uniform grid resolution of 1 km in UTM zone 29 N projection. After removing parameters with insignificant effects a model of main effects was produced with sea state and distance to the tidal front having a significant negative effect on the rate of encountering harbour porpoises during both sets of cruises analysed (August 1997 and other surveys). During both sets of cruises the distance to the tidal front had a larger effect on the distribution of the animals than sea state. The strong relationship between harbour porpoise distribution and the average position of the tidal front around the Faroes strongly suggests that the species concentrates near the quasi-stationary <b>circular</b> <b>shelf</b> front separating mixed from stratified waters around the Faroes. However, the importance of shelf fronts for the distribution of harbour porpoises needs to be studied in detail in order to establish the proportionof the populations associated with these structures...|$|E
40|$|Twin {{experiments}} {{were made to}} compare the reduced rank Kalman filter (RRKF), ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), and ensemble square-root Kalman filter (EnSKF) for coastal ocean problems in three idealized regimes: a flat bottom <b>circular</b> <b>shelf</b> driven by tidal forcing at the open boundary; an linear slope continental shelf with river discharge; and a rectangular estuary with tidal flushing intertidal zones and freshwater discharge. The hydrodynamics model {{used in this study}} is the unstructured grid Finite-Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM). Comparison results show that the success of the data assimilation method depends on sampling location, assimilation methods (univariate or multivariate covariance approaches), {{and the nature of the}} dynamical system. In general, for these applications, EnKF and EnSKF work better than RRKF, especially for time-dependent cases with large perturbations. In EnKF and EnSKF, multivariate covariance approaches should be used in assimilation to avoid the appearance of unrealistic numerical oscillations. Because the coastal ocean features multiscale dynamics in time and space, a case-by-case approach should be used to determine the most effective and most reliable data assimilation method for different dynamical systems.
