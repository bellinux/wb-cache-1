40|$|For {{my summer}} {{internship}} project, I organized {{a pilot study}} to analyze {{the effects of a}} cephalic fluid shift on venous return and right ventricular mechanics to increase right ventricular and venous knowledge. To accomplish this pilot study, I wrote a testing protocol, obtained Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, completed subject payment forms, lead testing sessions, and analyzed the data. This experiment used - 20 deg head down tilt (20 HDT) as the ground based simulation for the fluid shift that occurs during spaceflight and compared it to data obtained from the seated and supine positions. Using echocardiography, data was collected for the right ventricle, hepatic vein, internal jugular vein, external jugular vein, and inferior vena cava. Additionally, non-invasive venous pressure measurements, similar to those soon to be done in-orbit, were collected. It was determined that the venous return from below the heard is increased during 20 HDT, which was supported by increased hepatic vein velocities, increased right ventricular inflow, and increased right ventricular strain at 20 HDT relative to seated values. Jugular veins in the neck undergo an increase in pressure and area, but no significant increase in flow, relative to seated values when a subject is tilted 20 HDT. Contrary to the initial expectations based on this jugular flow, there was no significant increase in central venous pressure, as evidenced by no change in Doppler indices for right arterial pressure or inferior vena cava diameter. It is suspected that these differences in pressure are due to the hydrostatic pressure indifference point shifting during tilt; there is a potential for a similar phenomenon with microgravity. This data will hopefully lead to a more in-depth understanding of the response of the body to microgravity and how those relate to the previously mentioned cardiovascular risk of fluid shift that is associated with spaceflight. These results were presented in greater detail to the <b>Cardiovascular</b> <b>Laboratory</b> and the Space Life Science Summer Institute, which helped me prepare for future graduate school research presentations. This internship allowed me to apply and expand the anatomy, physiology, and mechanics information I learned during my undergraduate degree in Biomedical Engineering to the cardiovascular system with the unique zero gravity perspective. Additionally, I was able to develop skills with data analysis techniques involving speckle tracking for ventricular strain and Doppler waveforms for blood velocities. Additionally, I was able to expand upon my previous work in the <b>Cardiovascular</b> <b>Laboratory</b> by writing a literature review on a data analysis project I completed last summer. Ultimately, this internship and venous relationship comparison project provided me with a significant learning experience and additional skill sets, which are applicable to my goals of attaining a Ph.

40|$|We {{reviewed}} {{the records of}} 10, 661 patients who had undergone coronary angiography at the Clayton Foundation <b>Cardiovascular</b> <b>Laboratories</b> between 1 June 1974 and 15 March 1986, and identified major coronary artery anomalies in 83 adults. In addition, we included in our review 9 adults and 2 adolescents who had been referred for evaluation of anomalies documented elsewhere. Here we present the clinical and angiographic data for all 94 patients (76 men and 18 women). Most patients were men who presented with chest pain. The most common anomaly, found in 38 patients, was origin of left circumflex coronary artery from right coronary artery or right aortic sinus. In contrast to other studies, which have not shown increased incidence of coronary atherosclerosis in the anomalous circumflex artery, 71 % of our patients with this anomaly had significant coronary atherosclerosis in the proximal portion of the anomalous vessel. The posterior course of the anomalous circumflex coronary artery may predispose this vessel to atherosclerosis in patients with coronary disease.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) carried out within three days of a first stroke or transient ischaemic attack of cryptogenic or lacunar type may disclose more thrombi or spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) than previously reported. This finding may help early treatment decisions.  METHODS—Patients aged between 40 and 80 years, admitted for transient ischaemic attack or ischaemic stroke during a 40 month period, were prospectively considered. TOE was carried out within 72 hours of symptom onset with a 5 MHz biplanar transducer. Subjects with recurring events, very severe strokes, large artery obstructions, or obvious cardiac sources of embolism were excluded.  RESULTS—Sixty five patients were studied, 43 with a cryptogenic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (66. 2 %), and 22 with a lacunar stroke (33. 8 %). The mean (SD) interval between symptom onset and TOE was 43. 4 (17. 2) hours for cryptogenic, and 48. 5 (19. 5) hours for lacunar patients. Atrial thrombi were found in one patient with a cryptogenic stroke (2. 32 % of cryptogenic events; 95 % confidence interval 0. 06 - 12. 29), whereas SEC was found in five patients (7. 7 % overall), two with a lacunar and three with a cryptogenic stroke.  CONCLUSIONS—An early TOE {{does not seem to}} increase substantially the detection of atrial thrombi or SEC in patients with a first stroke or transient ischaemic attack of cryptogenic or lacunar nature. Therefore, this examination can be carried out when the patients' conditions are stable, and without overloading the <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>laboratory</b> daily schedule. ...|$|E
40|$|Midodrine {{prevents}} post-space flight {{orthostatic intolerance}} when testing is {{conducted in a}} controlled laboratory setting within 2 - 4 hours after Space Shuttle landing. It is unknown if midodrine is as effective during re-entry and immediately following landing. METHODS: Cardiovascular responses to 10 minutes of 80 head-up tilt in five male astronauts were compared before and immediately after Space Shuttle missions. Preflight tests were conducted in the Johnson Space Center <b>Cardiovascular</b> <b>Laboratory</b> without midodrine. Post-flight testing was performed in the Crew Transport Vehicle on the Space Shuttle runway within 60 minutes of landing; midodrine was self-administered before re-entry. Survival analysis was performed (Gehan-Breslow test) to compare presyncope rates pre- to post-flight. Cardiovascular responses (last minute standing minus supine) to tilt before and after space flight were compared using paired t-tests. RESULTS: Midodrine did not prevent post-flight orthostatic hypotension {{in two of the}} five astronauts, but the rate of presyncope across the group did not increase (p= 0. 17) from pre- to post-flight. Also, although the change in heart rate from supine to the last minute of standing was not affected by space flight, systolic blood pressure decreased more (p= 0. 05) and diastolic blood pressure tended to decrease (p= 0. 08) after space flight. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate interpretation of the current results requires that similar data be collected in control subjects (without midodrine) on the CTV. However, drug interaction concerns with commonly used anti-emetics and potentiation of prolonged QTc intervals observed in long duration astronauts make the routine use of midodrine for immediate post-flight orthostatic hypotension unlikely. ...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that it is known that {{hypertension}} may be associated to early atherosclerosis manifestations, few data are to date available on the relationship between early carotid abnormalities and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. To address this issue, 142 hypertensive patients (64 females and 78 males) younger than 55 years, at the first diagnosis of mild-to-moderate essential hypertension (WHO/ISH criteria), were selected from a database consisting of 3541 subjects referred to ultrasound <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>laboratory</b> in the last 5 years. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) was detected by high-resolution vascular ultrasound and left ventricular structure and function by the use of Doppler echocardiography. According to carotid IMT values, all patients were subgrouped into two groups consisting of 89 (62. 6 %) pts with IMT > or = 1 mm (A) and 53 (37. 4 %) pts with IMT < 1 mm (B). Our results show that isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), deceleration time of E velocity (EDT) and left ventricular relative wall thickness (LV-RWT) were significantly (P < 0. 05) higher in group A (IVRT 112 +/- 8. 9 ms; EDT 288 +/- 21. 8 ms; LV-RWT 0. 40 +/- 0. 08) than in group B (IVRT 92. 3 +/- 4. 6 ms; EDT 203. 3 +/- 27. 01 ms; LV- RWT 0. 37 +/- 0. 06). Moreover, the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was significantly (P < 0. 01) higher in group A (30 / 89; 33. 7 %) than in group B (8 / 53; 15 %). A positive correlation (P < 0. 001) between IMT, EDT and IVRT was found only in hypertensives without LVH. These results are consistent with the indication that IMT evaluation has to be recommended both in hypertensive patients with LVH and in those without LVH, but with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. This approach might improve the prognostic stratification of hypertensive subjects and it might be suitable to recognize the subset of patients at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease or events early...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{development}} of commercially available assays from {{the measurement of}} enzyme activity to mass concentrations of proteins, especially the assays of cardiac troponin I and T, {{has been the most}} important innovation in the field of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>laboratory</b> diagnostics over the decade. The availability of a simple, rapid test using whole blood to facilitate processing and to reduce the turnaround time could improve the management of patients presenting with chest pain. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the analytical and clinical performance of a new time-resolved fluorometry-based immunology technology using the cardiac marker and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein assays. In addition, the use of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein assay for the investigation of patients with acute atrial fibrillation and the influence of heparin for cardiac marker assays were studied. The levels of precision attained with pooled serum and plasma samples and control materials were acceptable. The assays were found to be linear within the ranges tested. The correlation coefficient between the Innotrac Aio! 1 st generation cTnI and Abbott AxSYM cTnI assays was 0. 960, and the slope was 0. 07. The correlations between the 2 nd generation Innotrac Aio!, Access AccuTnI and Abbott AxSYM assays were good, but there were biases between the methods. The correlation coefficients between the Innotrac Aio! and Abbott AxSYM CK-MB and myoglobin assays were 0. 995 and 0. 971, respectively, but the Innotrac Aio! CK-MB assay yielded about 9 % higher values than the Abbott assay. The correlations between Innotrac Aio! usCRP and Cobas Integra CRP latex and between Innotrac Aio! usCRP and Hitachi CRP (Latex) HS were good. Furthermore, the sample material correlation studies showed no significant differences when the Innotrac Aio! System was used. However, the mean Abbott AxSYM CK-MB values and the cTnI values for heparin plasma samples were 17 % higher and about 15 % lower than for serum samples, respectively. In the investigation of CRP levels in patients with acute atrial fibrillation CRP tended to be higher in the patients with acute FA, and there was a positive correlation between the concentrations of CRP and IL- 6. The results demonstrate the excellent analytical performance of the Innotrac Aio! 2 nd generation cTnI, myoglobin, CK-MB and usCRP assays, and all the matrices, including serum, plasma and whole blood, are suitable sample matrices to be used with these methods without further standardization...|$|E
40|$|During lunar {{excursions}} in the EVA suit, real-time {{measurement of}} metabolic rate {{is required to}} manage consumables and guide activities to ensure safe return to the base. Metabolic rate, or oxygen consumption (VO 2), is normally measured from pulmonary parameters but cannot be determined with standard techniques in the oxygen-rich environment of a spacesuit. Our group has developed novel near infrared spectroscopic (NIRS) methods to calculate muscle oxygen saturation (SmO 2), hematocrit, and pH, and we recently demonstrated {{that we can use}} our NIRS sensor to measure VO 2 on the leg during cycling. Our NSBRI project has 4 objectives: (1) increase the accuracy of the metabolic rate calculation through improved prediction of stroke volume; (2) investigate the relative contributions of calf and thigh oxygen consumption to metabolic rate calculation for walking and running; (3) demonstrate that the NIRS-based noninvasive metabolic rate methodology is sensitive enough to detect decrement in VO 2 in a space analog; and (4) improve instrumentation to allow testing within a spacesuit. Over the past year we have made progress on all four objectives, but the most significant progress was made in improving the instrumentation. The NIRS system currently in use at JSC is based on fiber optics technology. Optical fiber bundles are used to deliver light from a light source in the monitor to the patient, and light reflected back from the patient s muscle to the monitor for spectroscopic analysis. The fiber optic cables are large and fragile, {{and there is no way}} to get them in and out of the test spacesuit used for ground-based studies. With complimentary funding from the US Army, we undertook a complete redesign of the sensor and control electronics to build a novel system small enough to be used within the spacesuit and portable enough to be used by a combat medic. In the new system the filament lamp used in the fiber optic system was replaced with a novel broadband near infrared LED light source. The compact grating spectrometer was replaced with a chip-scale spectrometer. With this new design, the sensor is 4 in 2 in 0. 5 in, weighs 60 g, and no fiber optic cables are needed. The sensor, which contains the light source and the spectrometer, is adhered directly to the skin with medical grade adhesive. The sensor can be powered via the USB port of the laptop computer that controls the sensor operation. Alternatively, for studies in the spacesuit, the sensor can be powered by a small battery pack and operated by an ultra-portable hand-held computer. Both the handheld computer and battery pack will easily fit within the PLSS of the test spacesuit. System automation was significantly improved, to add features suggested by our colleagues in the <b>Cardiovascular</b> <b>Laboratory</b> and the NASA JSC Exercise Physiology and Countermeasures Project.

40|$|Introduction: While the {{physiologic}} {{effects of}} space travel are documented in healthy individuals, {{little is known}} about its impact on medically ill or injured persons. In this study, hemorrhagic shock in primates was used to model a potentially common pathophysiologic condition during exposure to gravitational forces simulating return from Earth orbit. This experiment did not model the effects of cardiovascular deconditioning that normally occur during spaceflight. Methods: Using invasive hemodynamic monitoring, serial <b>cardiovascular</b> and <b>laboratory</b> parameters in baboons (Papio papio) were studied. Subjects were centrifuged at either a low +Gx (3. 3 G maximum) or high +Gx (7. 8 G maximum) acceleration reentry profile before and after being subjected to either class II (20 % volume loss) or class IV (40 % volume loss) hemorrhagic shock. Results: Significant alterations in <b>cardiovascular</b> and <b>laboratory</b> parameters occurred during shock and exposure to high and low +Gx acceleration. Shock classification was the primary determinant of change in cardiovascular function. During the experimental protocol, 31 of 32 animals survived (97 % survival). After a 1 -wk post-protocol observation period, 28 of 32 subjects survived (88 % survival). Conclusions: This preliminary study presents data that suggest that the emergent return of a medically compromised individual without resuscitation may be potentially survivable. However, medical stabilization with volume resuscitation, supplemental oxygen, and noninvasive monitoring would likely optimize clinical outcomes in the event of significant hemorrhagic shock states necessitating emergent deorbit...|$|R

Prinzmetal's Angina Pectoris To the Editor: A very {{interesting}} paper by Yasue and associates concerning the role of the autonomic nervous system in the pathogenesis of Prinzmetal's angina pectoris appeared in the September 1974 issue of Circulation. The authors report their ability to precipitate at-tacks of angina pectoris with the choline ester methacholine and were able to block this response by prior administration of atropine. Although the authors did not demonstrate coronary artery spasm in their patients at the time of coronary arteriography, the literature now contains enough reports of non-catheter-induced spasm in the large coronary vessels in individuals with this syndrome to support Prinz-metal's original thoughts about the etiology of this un-usual and interesting form of angina pectoris. Aside from the obvious therapeutic implications of parasympathetic triggering of coronary artery spasm, {{it is quite possible that}} many episodes of coronary artery spasm which would otherwise be noted at the time of coronary arteriography are thwarted by prior administration of atropine which many <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>laboratories</b> give prior to injecting the coronary arteries in order to diminish bradycardia.
