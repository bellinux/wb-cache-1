40|$|Abstract: This study {{focuses on}} driver eye {{movements}} and vehicle control behaviour, factors {{implicated in the}} human errors that {{are considered to be}} important factors that may cause traffic accidents. Some <b>curved</b> <b>sections</b> of urban motorways have a comparatively high frequency of accident occurrence. The authors attempted to link three factors, namely eye movement, roadway alignment, and driver speed and steering control. In order to analyse the factors that lead to human error, an in-car experiment was carried out on some routes with <b>curved</b> <b>sections</b> of the Tokyo Metropolitan Expressway. This study focuses on single-car collisions occurring primarily in free-flow regions. Using the results of the experiment, the authors were able to analyse the factors that produce human error in relation to motorway alignment, eye movement, and centrifugal acceleration in the <b>curved</b> <b>sections.</b> As a result, the authors proposed a model that evaluates the risk of <b>curved</b> <b>sections</b> in relation to the driver’s eye movement and driving behaviour...|$|R

25|$|The bluefin {{trevally}} {{is a large}} fish, {{growing to}} a maximum known length of 117cm and a weight of 43.5kg, however it is rare at lengths greater than 80cm. It is similar in shape {{to a number of}} other large jacks and trevallies, having an oblong, compressed body with the dorsal profile slightly more convex than the ventral profile, particularly anteriorly. This slight convexity leads to the species having a much more pointed snout than most other members of Caranx. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first consisting of 8 spines and the second of 1 spine followed by 21 to 24 soft rays. The anal fin consists of 2 anteriorly detached spines followed by 1 spine and 17 to 20 soft rays. The pelvic fins contain 1 spine and 20 soft rays. The caudal fin is strongly forked, and the pectoral fins are falcate, being longer than the length of the head. The lateral line has a pronounced and moderately long anterior arch, with the <b>curved</b> <b>section</b> intersecting the straight section below the lobe of the second dorsal fin. The <b>curved</b> <b>section</b> of the lateral line contains 55-70 scales while the straight section contains 0 to 10 scales followed by 27 to 42 strong scutes. The chest is completely covered in scales. The upper jaw contains a series of strong outer canines with an inner band of smaller teeth, while the lower jaw contains a single row of widely spaced conical teeth. The species has 25 to 29 gill rakers in total and there are 24 vertebrae present. The eye is covered by a moderately weakly developed adipose eyelid, and the posterior extremity of the jaw is vertically under or just past the anterior margin of the eye. Despite their wide range, the only geographical variation in the species is the depth of the body in smaller specimens.|$|E
25|$|The old {{cantilever}} bridge {{was connected to}} the Yerba Buena tunnel with a double-deck truss causeway that included a <b>curved</b> <b>section.</b> As this structure occupied an area that must be clear for the new bridge approach, it was necessary to construct an entirely new, temporary approach to the old bridge. This was required to swing to the south to clear the area for new construction, and then back to the north with a more severe curve to connect to the cantilever. As there would only be a few days available during which the bridge could be shut to traffic, the curved portion was built adjacent to its final position on a trestle that extended beneath and beyond the old curved connector. During replacement, the old section was jacked out of the way (to the north), and the new section jacked into place.|$|E

25|$|In 1934, the German Army High Command (OKH) {{commissioned}} Krupp of Essen {{to design}} a gun to destroy the forts of the French Maginot Line that were nearing completion. The gun's shells had to punch through seven metres of reinforced concrete or one full metre of steel armour plate, from beyond the range of French artillery. Krupp engineer Erich Müller calculated that the task would require a weapon with a calibre of around 80cm, firing a projectile weighing 7 tonnes from a barrel 30 metres long. The weapon would have a weight of over 1000 tonnes. The size and weight meant that to be at all movable it {{would need to be}} supported on twin sets of railway tracks. In common with smaller railway guns, the only barrel movement on the mount itself would be elevation, traverse being managed by moving the weapon along a <b>curved</b> <b>section</b> of {{what turned out to be}} a dual-track railway line.

The terminal soft rays of both the anal and dorsal fins are nearly {{twice as long as}} the penultimate rays, forming distinctive finlet-like structures, although are still attached to the main fin structure by interradial membranes. The lateral line is slightly arched anteriorally, with the intersection of the curved and straight section occurring below the sixth to eighth dorsal soft ray. The <b>curved</b> <b>section</b> contains between 39 and 57 scales, while the straight section has no to 10 scales and 36 to 49 scutes.

This feature is only observable in individuals greater than 10cm, as juveniles below this length are still developing the eyelid. Both jaws have a single row of small teeth, although two or three rows of small canine teeth are present in older individuals. There are 37 to 44 gill rakers in total and 24 vertebrae. The yellowtail scad is a small species in comparison with many of the other fishes within the Carangidae, reaching a recorded maximum length of only 30cm, although is more often encountered around 20cm.|$|E

The body is elongate and subcylindrical, becoming highly compressed toward the tail and caudal fin, with a marked median keel on the caudal peduncle. The dorsal and ventral profiles of the fish are nearly evenly , with the two profiles intersecting at the pointed snout. There are two separate dorsal fins; the first consisting of 8 moderately high spines and the second of a single spine followed by 18 to 20 soft rays.
