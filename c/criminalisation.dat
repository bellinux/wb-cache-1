5|$|On 3 February 2013, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2013 was {{promulgated by}} President Pranab Mukherjee. It {{provides}} for amendment of the Indian Penal Code, Indian Evidence Act, and Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, on laws related to sexual offences. The ordinance {{provides for the}} death penalty in cases of rape. According to Minister of Law and Justice Ashwani Kumar, 90 percent of the suggestions given by the Verma Committee Report were incorporated into the Ordinance. However, critics state that many key suggestions of the commission have been ignored, including the <b>criminalisation</b> of marital rape and trying military personnel accused of sexual offences under criminal law.|$|E
5|$|The {{administrative}} {{actions and}} subsequent suspension of Nagpal received widespread attention in India. She was widely praised for making efforts {{to clean up}} the corruption in the Indian political system. References were made with the Hindu goddess Durga for taking action against the politically well-connected sand-mining mafia and real estate barons. According to Surinder S. Jodhka, professor and chair at the Centre for the Study of Social Systems in Jawaharlal Nehru University, the protest after Nagpal's suspension are due to the growing discontent within India's growing middle-class with <b>criminalisation</b> in politics. Due to the public protests, the UP government had to engage in damage control, highlighting its welfare schemes and announcing that it is considering to set up a task force to check illegal mining.|$|E
5|$|These {{industrialization}} measures proved largely unsuccessful {{given that}} coca remained illegal in most nations outside Bolivia, thus depriving the growers {{of an international}} market. Campaigning against this, in 2012 Bolivia withdrew from the UN 1961 Convention which had called for global <b>criminalisation</b> of coca, and in 2013 successfully convinced the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs to declassify coca as a narcotic. The U.S. State Department criticised Bolivia, asserting that it was regressing in its counter-narcotics efforts, and dramatically reduced aid to Bolivia to $34 million to fight the narcotics trade in 2007. Nevertheless, the number of cocaine seizures in Bolivia increased under Morales' government, as they sought to encourage coca growers to report and oppose cocaine producers and traffickers. However, high levels of police corruption surrounding the illicit trade in cocaine remained a continuing problem for Bolivia.|$|E
5|$|Early modern Scotland was a {{theoretically}} patriarchal society, {{in which}} men had total authority over women, but how this worked is practice is difficult to discern. Marriages, particularly higher in society, were often political in nature {{and the subject of}} complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating and finding marriages, as Lady Glenorchy did for her children in the 1560s and 1570s, or as matchmakers, finding suitable and compatible partners. Before the Reformation, the extensive marriage bars for kinship meant that most marriages necessitated a papal dispensation, which could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient. At the beginning of the period, women had a very limited legal status. The criminal courts refused to recognise them as witnesses or independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions was assumed to lie with their husbands, fathers and kin. In the post-Reformation period there was a <b>criminalisation</b> of women, partly evident in witchcraft prosecutions from 1563. Through the 1640s, independent commissions were set up to try women for child murder, and after pressure from the kirk a law of 1690 placed the presumption of guilt on a woman if she concealed a pregnancy and birth, and her child later died.|$|E

25|$|The Act, {{should it}} take effect, would broaden the <b>criminalisation</b> of {{same-sex}} relations in Uganda domestically. It also includes provisions about persons outside of Uganda who {{are charged with}} violating the Act, asserting {{that they may be}} extradited to Uganda for punishment there. The Act also includes penalties for individuals, companies, and non-governmental organisations that aid or abet same-sex sexual acts, including conducting a gay marriage.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Singapore {{society is}} highly {{regulated}} through the <b>criminalisation</b> of many activities which are considered as fairly harmless in other countries. These include failing to flush toilets after use, littering, jaywalking, {{the possession of}} pornography, the sale of chewing gum, and sexual activity such as oral and anal sex between men. Nonetheless, Singapore {{is one of the}} countries with the least crime in the world, with a low incidence of violent crimes.|$|E

25|$|Norris {{took the}} Attorney General to the High Court over the <b>criminalisation</b> of {{homosexual}} acts. His claim {{was based on}} the fact that the law infringed on his right to privacy and that since the introduction of the Constitution of Ireland the law passed under British rule became repugnant to the constitution. The High Court ruled against Norris. He appealed his case to the Supreme Court of Ireland. In 1983 (in Norris v. Attorney General), the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law by a three to two verdict.|$|E

In 1998 and 2008, he supported relaxation of the then strict laws against pornography, arguing that pornography can have some social benefits, and he has criticised {{what he calls the}} body-shame phobia against nudism, suggesting that nudity may be natural and healthy for society.|$|E
25|$|Church going {{played an}} {{important}} part in the lives of many women. Women were largely excluded from the administration of the Kirk, but when heads of households voted on the appointment of a new minister some parishes allowed women in that position to participate. In the post-Reformation period there was a <b>criminalisation</b> of women. Women were disciplined in kirk sessions and civil courts for stereotypical offences including scolding and prostitution, which were seen as deviant, rather than criminal. These changing attitudes may partly explain the witch hunts that occurred after the Reformation and in which women were the largest group of victims.|$|E
25|$|Article 7 {{prohibits the}} {{retroactive}} <b>criminalisation</b> of acts and omissions. No {{person may be}} punished for an act {{that was not a}} criminal offence {{at the time of its}} commission. The article states that a criminal offence is one under either national or international law, which would permit a party to prosecute someone for a crime which was not illegal under domestic law at the time, so long as it was prohibited by international law. The Article also prohibits a heavier penalty being imposed than was applicable at the time when the criminal act was committed.|$|E
25|$|The BNP has {{a highly}} {{centralised}} structure that gives its chairman near-total control. It established {{a range of}} sub-groups—such as a youth wing, record label, and trade union—and built links with extreme-right parties across Europe. Regarded as the most successful far-right party in British history, the BNP attracted most support from within White British working-class communities in northern and eastern England, particularly among middle-aged and elderly men. More widely, it was highly unpopular and faced much opposition from anti-fascists, religious organisations, and mainstream politicians and media. BNP members were banned {{from a number of}} professions, and polling suggested that a majority of Britons favoured the party's <b>criminalisation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Rashtriya Janata Dal leader, Lalu Prasad's, {{support of}} social justice ensured that {{politics}} was dominated by Mandal politics and caste rather than development during this period. Also, the <b>criminalisation</b> of politics during this time created a business unfriendly climate {{and contributed to the}} economic collapse. The biggest crisis business faced was with organised kidnapping, which the local BJP leaders claimed was linked to the ruling RJD. The resulting crisis led to a flight of capital, middle class professionals, and business leaders to other parts of India. The flight of business and capital increased unemployment and this led to the mass migration of Bihari farmers and unemployed youth to more developed states of India.|$|E
25|$|According to the 2007 {{study by}} Memorial and Demos human rights organisations, Russian policemen lose their {{qualifications}} and professional skills during their duty tours in Chechnya. This conflict {{was linked to}} the rising brutality and general <b>criminalisation</b> of the Russian police forces. According to human rights activists and journalists, tens of thousands of police and security forces that have been to Chechnya learned patterns of brutality and impunity and brought them to their home regions, often returning with disciplinary and psychological problems. Reliable numbers on police brutality are hard to come by, but in a statement released in 2006, the internal affairs department of Russia's Interior Ministry said that the number of recorded crimes committed by police officers rose 46.8% in 2005. In one nationwide poll in 2005, 71% of respondents said they didn't trust their police at all; in another, 41% Russians said they lived in fear of police violence. According to Amnesty International, torture of detainees in Russia is now endemic. Since 2007, police officers from outside Caucasus are now not only being sent to Chechnya, but to all the region's republics.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations {{has urged}} India to decriminalise {{homosexuality}} by {{saying it would}} help the fight against HIV/AIDS by allowing intervention programmes, much like the successful ones in China and Brazil. Jeffrey O'Malley, director of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on HIV/AIDS, has stated countries which protect {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) have double the rate of coverage of HIV prevention services as much as 60%. According to him, inappropriate <b>criminalisation</b> hinders universal access to essential HIV, health and social services. Later talking to The Hindu in November 2008, he added concerns that the then in power United Progressive Alliance government was in a difficult position in regards to amending Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code because of the then upcoming elections, as such changes could be misrepresented. He further emphasised the need to change the laws, sensitise the police and judiciary. According to him, after removal of discriminatory laws, marginalised groups would have better access to treatment and prevention facilities like condoms. He warned of the urgency and stated that India had succeeded in checking the spread of AIDS through commercial sex workers but transmission through gay sex, and injectable-drug users was still an area of concern in the country.|$|E
500|$|For conspiracy, the {{standard}} justification is the [...] "group-danger" [...] rationale, {{which states that}} since {{the objective of the}} criminal law is to protect harm to the community, and the community is at more risk from a group of people with harmful intentions than an individual with those same intentions, conspiracies themselves must be made a crime. The <b>criminalisation</b> of incitement is justified with the argument that incitement constitutes an attempt at conspiracy; the inciter's objective is to persuade others to engage in criminal acts, with his knowledge and cooperation, and as such is [...] "more dangerous than a direct attempt, because it may give rise to that cooperation among criminals which is a special hazard".|$|E
500|$|There are {{two general}} types of homicide, murder and manslaughter. Murder {{requires}} an intention {{to kill or}} an intention to commit grievous bodily harm. If this intention is present {{but there are certain}} types of mitigating factors [...] loss of control, diminished responsibility, or pursuance of a suicide pact [...] then this is voluntary manslaughter. There are two types of involuntary manslaughter. Firstly, it may be [...] "constructive" [...] or [...] "unlawful act" [...] manslaugher, where a lesser but inherently criminal and dangerous act has caused the death. Alternatively, manslaughter may be caused by gross negligence, where the defendant has broken a duty of care over the victim, where that breach has led to the death, and is sufficiently gross as to warrant <b>criminalisation.</b>|$|E
500|$|Now {{based in}} Battersea, Tyndall left Jordan and the NSM and formed his own rival, the Greater Britain Movement (GBM). According to Tyndall, [...] "the Greater Britain Movement will uphold, and preach, pure National Socialism". According to the {{political}} scientist Stan Taylor, the GBM reflected Tyndall's desire for [...] "a specifically British variant of National Socialism". It called for the <b>criminalisation</b> of sexual relations and marriages between white Britons and non-whites and called for the sterilisation of those it deemed unfit to reproduce. The group established its base in a run-down building in Notting Hill, with swastikas being sprayed onto the exterior and an image of Hitler decorating the interior. Tyndall tried to convince the WUNS to accept his GBM as its British representative, however Rockwell—concerned not to encourage schismatic dissenters in his own American Nazi Party—sided with Jordan and the NSM. Tyndall then established contact with Rockwell's main rival in the American Neo-Nazi scene, the National States' Rights Party.|$|E
500|$|In the post-Reformation period {{there was}} a <b>criminalisation</b> of women. Women were disciplined in kirk {{sessions}} and civil courts for stereotypical offenses including scolding and prostitution, which were seen as deviant, rather than criminal. Through the 1640s there were independent commissions set up to try women for child murder and, after pressure from the kirk, a law of 1690 placed the presumption of guilt on a woman who concealed a pregnancy and birth and whose child later died. In {{the aftermath of the}} initial Reformation settlement, Parliament passed the Witchcraft Act 1563, similar to that passed in England one year earlier, which made the practice of witchcraft itself and consulting with witches capital crimes. Between the passing of the act and its repeal in 1736, an estimated 6,000 persons were tried for witchcraft in Scotland. Most of the accused, some 75 per cent, were women, with over 1,500 executed, and the witch hunt in Scotland has been seen as a means of controlling women. Various reasons for the Scottish witch-hunt, and its more intense nature than that in England, have been advanced by historians. Many of the major periods of prosecution coincided with periods of intense economic distress and some accusations may have followed the withdrawal of charity from marginal figures, particularly the single women that made up many of the accused. Changing attitudes to women, particularly in the reformed kirk, which may have perceived women as more of a moral threat, have also been noted. The proliferation of partial explanations for the witch hunt has led some historians to proffer the concept of [...] "associated circumstances", rather than one single significant cause.|$|E
500|$|On 30 March 2010, Alan Johnson, {{the then}} Home Secretary, {{announced}} mephedrone {{would be made}} illegal [...] "within weeks" [...] after the ACMD sent him {{a report on the}} use of cathinones. The legislation would make all cathinones illegal, which Johnson said would [...] "stop unscrupulous manufacturers and others peddling different but similarly harmful drugs". The ACMD had run into problems with the UK Government in 2009 regarding drugs policy, after the government did not follow the advice of the ACMD to reclassify ecstasy and cannabis, culminating in the dismissal of the ACMD chairman, David Nutt, after he reiterated the ACMD's findings in an academic lecture. Several members resigned after he was sacked, and prior to the announcement that mephedrone was to be banned, the trend continued when Dr Polly Taylor resigned, saying she [...] "did not have trust" [...] in the way the government would use the advice given by the ACMD. Eric Carlin, a member of the ACMD and former chairman of the English Drug Education Forum, also resigned after the announcement. He said the decision by the Home Secretary was [...] "unduly based on media and political pressure" [...] and there was [...] "little or no discussion about how our recommendation to classify this drug would be likely to impact on young people's behaviour." [...] Some former members of the ACMD and various charity groups expressed concern over the banning of the drug, arguing it would inevitably criminalise users, particularly young people. Others expressed concern that the drug would be left in the hands of black market dealers, who will only compound the problem. Carlin's resignation was specifically linked to the <b>criminalisation</b> of mephedrone, he stated: [...] "We need to review our entire approach to drugs, dumping the idea that legally-sanctioned punishments for drug users should constitute a main part of the armoury in helping to solve our country’s drug problems. We need to stop harming people who need help and support".|$|E

2500|$|Discussion of {{proposed}} law reform {{became an issue}} in the 2011 elections, with some support from opposition parties likely to become the new Government. A group of non-government and union bodies emerged pressuring both the current government and opposition parties to abolish prostitution, by criminalising the buying of sex, along Swedish lines. [...] At the same time, those supporting the status quo or advocating a more liberal approach challenged this argument. In the ensuing Dáil election on 25 February, a new Government was formed by Fine Gael (70 seats) and Labour (34 seats). The women's branch of the Labour Party support <b>criminalisation</b> of purchase.|$|E

2500|$|From their inception, ASBOs were controversial. They were criticised {{as being}} [...] "without strong and principled justification", a {{distraction}} from {{the failure of the}} government's law and order policies, a [...] "recipe for institutionalised vigilantism", and an [...] "emblem of punitive populism". Andrew Rutherford commented that the [...] "ASBO provides a particularly striking example of the <b>criminalisation</b> of social policy". A MORI opinion poll published on 9 June 2005 found that 82% of the British public were in favour of ASBOs; however, only 39% believed they were effective in their current form.

2500|$|In New Zealand, a group {{calling itself}} [...] "Women Against Pornography" [...] was active during the eighties and early nineties (1983–1995), {{though it had}} no formal {{connection}} to the American group. They are best known for their 1984 attempt to force the resignation of New Zealand Chief Censor Arthur Everard after he allowed the horror film I Spit on Your Grave to be shown in that country. In this national context, the Society for Promotion of Community Standards had tried to prevent the <b>criminalisation</b> of spousal rape in 1982, so there were tensions between the Christian Right and feminist anti-pornography activists, {{as well as a}} strengthened movement for LGBT rights in New Zealand that also benefited from prevalent social liberalism, pointing out that gay pornography did not operate according to the same psychological and sociological parameters as its heterosexual equivalent. When it dissolved in 1995, Women Against Pornography had not adopted a strategy that converged with the New Zealand Christian Right, unlike many of its national counterparts abroad. Much of this was due to the weakness of the New Zealand Society for Promotion of Community Standards after co-belligerency against the Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986.|$|E
2500|$|Article 8 {{provides}} {{a right to}} respect for one's [...] "private and family life, his home and his correspondence", subject to certain restrictions that are [...] "in accordance with law" [...] and [...] "necessary in a democratic society". This article clearly {{provides a}} right to be free of unlawful searches, but the Court has given the protection for [...] "private and family life" [...] that this article provides a broad interpretation, taking for instance that prohibition of private consensual homosexual acts violates this article. There have been cases discussing consensual familial sexual relationships, and how the <b>criminalisation</b> of this may violate this article. However, the ECHR still deems such familial sexual acts to be criminal. This may be compared to the jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court, which has also adopted a somewhat broad interpretation of the right to privacy. Furthermore, Article8 sometimes comprises positive obligations: whereas classical human rights are formulated as prohibiting a State from interfering with rights, and thus not to do something (e.g. not to separate a family under family life protection), the effective enjoyment of such rights may also include an obligation for the State to become active, and to do something (e.g. to enforce access for a divorced parent to his/her child).|$|E
