40|$|Private equity {{partnerships}} {{are commonly}} regarded {{as examples of}} long-term commitment contracts. Limited partners commit the entire capital of the fund up-front and may face expensive default penalties for not honoring a <b>capital</b> <b>call.</b> Commitment, however, may be perceived to be stronger than it actually is, as explicit early termination provisions are also common. We develop a model {{to show how the}} degree of commitment can be used to screen general partners according to their managerial ability.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic model of optimal bank capital {{in which the}} bank optimizes over costs associated with failure, holding capital, and flows of external capital. The solution to the infinite-horizon optimization problem is related to period-by-period value-at-risk (var) in which the optimal probability of failure is endogenously determined. Over a cycle, var is positively correlated with optimal flows of external capital, but negatively correlated with optimal net changes in capital and the optimal level of total capital. Thus, a regulatory minimum requirement based on var, if binding, {{is likely to be}} procyclical. The model suggests several ways of reducing this problem. For example, a var-based requirement makes more sense if it is applied to external capital flows than if it is applied to the total level of <b>capital.</b> <b>Call</b> report data suggest that U. S. commercial bank behavior since 1984 is consistent with the model...|$|E

40|$|Merton and Perold (1993) {{offered a}} {{framework}} for determining risk capital in a financial firm based {{on the cost of}} the implicit guarantee the firm provides to the individual financial products sold. Merton and Perold assume the price of such guarantees is observable from the market at large. For an insurer, this may not be a realistic assumption. This paper proposes an insurance-specific framework for determining the cost of those parental guarantees, and utilizing that cost in pricing and portfolio mix evaluation. An insurer’s capital is treated as a shared asset, with the insurance contracts in the portfolio having simultaneous rights to access potentially all that shared capital. By granting underwriting capacity, an insurer’s management team is implicitly issuing a set of <b>capital</b> <b>call</b> options— similar in structure to letters of credit (LOC), except the calls are not for loans but for funding. The paper will (i) discuss the valuation of parental guarantees, beginning with Merton and Perold; (ii) treat insurer capital as a shared asset and explore the dual nature of insurer capital usage; (iii) offer a method for determining insurer capital usage cost; and (iv) demonstrate how this method could be used for product pricing and portfolio mix evaluation using economic value added concepts...|$|E
