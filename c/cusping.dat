40|$|The {{evolution}} of mammalian teeth {{is characterized by}} the frequent and convergent {{evolution of}} new <b>cusps.</b> The evolution of new <b>cusps</b> can be linked to tooth development via population-level variation. This allows testing whether development increases the capacity to evolve, or evolvability, by facilitating and even directing morphological change. In a population sample of living seals, variation in <b>cusp</b> number of individual teeth is from three to five <b>cusps,</b> the variably present <b>cusps</b> being the shortest ones that also develop last. By factoring in recent evidence on development, I show that the variation in <b>cusp</b> number can be explained by a patterning cascade mode of <b>cusp</b> development that cumulatively increases and directs height variation in short <b>cusps.</b> The biased variation in seal tooth <b>cusps</b> supports the recognition of teeth as highly evolvable because only small developmental changes are needed to produce large changes in size and number of small <b>cusps.</b> This evolvability of tooth <b>cusps</b> may have facilitated the fast and independent acquisition of new <b>cusps</b> in mammalian evolution. In phylogenetic studies, small <b>cusps</b> may be unreliable as phylogenetic signals.

We tested several hypotheses about overall crown size, individual <b>cusp</b> areas, and expression of Carabelli <b>cusps</b> in human permanent first molars by obtaining data from standardized occlusal photographs of 308 Australians of European descent (171 males and 137 females). Specifically, we aimed to calculate {{the areas of the}} four main molar <b>cusps,</b> and also Carabelli <b>cusp,</b> and to compare the relative variability of <b>cusp</b> areas in relation to timing of development. We also aimed to compare <b>cusp</b> areas between males and females and to describe how Carabelli <b>cusp</b> interacted with other molar <b>cusps.</b> Measurements included maximum crown diameters (mesiodistal and buccolingual crown diameters), the areas of the four main <b>cusps,</b> and the area of Carabelli <b>cusp.</b> The pattern of relative variability in absolute areas of molar <b>cusps</b> corresponded with their order of formation, the first-forming paracone displaying the least variation, and the last-forming Carabelli <b>cusp</b> showing the greatest. Overall crown size and areas of individual <b>cusps</b> all showed sexual dimorphism, with values in males exceeding those in females. Sexual dimorphism was smallest for paracone area and greatest for Carabelli <b>cusp</b> area. Overall crown size and <b>cusp</b> areas were larger in individuals displaying a Carabelli <b>cusp,</b> especially the hypocone area. Although the combined area of the protocone and a Carabelli <b>cusp</b> was greater in cuspal forms than noncuspal forms, protocone area alone was significantly smaller in the former. Our findings lead us to propose that, in individuals with the genotype for Carabelli trait expression, larger molar crowns are more likely to display Carabelli <b>cusps,</b> whereas molars with smaller crowns are more likely to display reduced forms of expression of the trait. We suggest that the pattern of folding of the internal enamel epithelium in developing molar crowns, particularly in the protocone region, can be modified by a developing Carabelli <b>cusp.</b> Shintaro Kondo and Grant C.
