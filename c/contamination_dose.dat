40|$|The {{technical}} feasibility {{of using the}} TREAT reactor facility for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) research was assessed. Using one-dimensional neutronics calculations, it was shown that the TREAT core neutron spectrum can be filtered to reduce the undesired radiation (<b>contamination)</b> <b>dose</b> per desired neutron more effectively than can the core spectra from two prominent candidate reactors. Using two-dimensional calculations, it was demonstrated that a non-optimized filter replacing the TREAT thermal column can yield a fluence of desired-energy neutrons {{more than twice as}} large as the fluence believed to be required and, at the same time, have a <b>contamination</b> <b>dose</b> per desired neutron almost as low as that from any other candidate facility.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} depth doses of 9 - 18 MeV electron beams measured with custom-built ionization chambers, film, and TLD in homogeneous solid water and bone-like phantoms {{as well as in}} a solid-water/bone heterogeneous phantom. Our measurement results show that dosimetry based on film and TLD corresponds well with ionization chamber dosimetry in both homogeneous and heterogeneous phantoms if appropriate methods for converting film or TLD responses to doses in phantom are used. We observed no clinically significant dose enhancement in relatively thin bone heterogeneities, however, we found dose enhancement in solid homogeneous bone phantoms. Work by previous investigators might have overestimated the dose in bone heterogeneities. We also found that the coefficient equivalent thickness (CET) method is suitable for estimating of dose in heterogeneous phantoms incorporating large uniform heterogeneities. The thesis also {{presents an}} investigation of magnitudes, energies, and dose profiles of photon contaminations for 9 - 18 MeV electron beams with various field sizes used clinically. Our measurements show that the magnitude of photon contamination increases both with electron beam energy and with field size.

Aim To test whether aseptic preparation of parenteral doses or additives to sterile doses undertaken in dedicated pharmaceutical rather than clinical environments {{reduces the risk of}} microbial <b>dose</b> <b>contamination.</b> Methods Data identified from a systematic review were examined using random effects meta-analyses, and t-tests were used to compare <b>dose</b> <b>contamination</b> frequencies. Findings In all, 16, 552 doses from 34 studies (33 records) were identified. For all the data combined there was a significantly higher frequency of <b>contamination</b> of <b>doses</b> prepared in clinical than in pharmaceutical environments { 3. 7 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 2. 2, 6. 2; N = 10, 272 doses] vs 0. 5 % (95 % CI: 0. 1, 1. 6; N = 6280 doses); P = 0. 007 }. <b>Contamination</b> of <b>doses</b> was significantly higher when prepared as individual lots than as part of a batch in pharmaceutical environments [2. 1 % (95 % CI: 0. 7, 5. 8; N = 168 doses) vs 0. 2 % (95 % CI: 0. 1, 0. 9; N = 6112 doses); P = 0. 002]. There was a significantly higher frequency of <b>dose</b> <b>contamination</b> if additions were made to sterile parenteral doses in clinical environments [risk ratio: 2. 121 (95 % CI: 1. 093, 4. 114); P = 0. 026]. The overall quality of the studies was judged to be low. Conclusion Reported rates of parenteral <b>dose</b> <b>contamination</b> were orders of magnitude higher than accepted reference standards, which may increase infection risk.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a parametric model, implemented {{on a personal}} computer, for calculating <b>contamination</b> and <b>doses</b> following a hypothetical nuclear accident. The model {{is embedded in the}} high level environment of Mathematica and uses the Gaussian solution for the plume structure at short and medium distances and a wedge-like behaviour for long distances calculation. Along with the usual effects, like the influence of a local wet ground deposition or the corrections due to build-up, the model deals also with other aspects, such as the long distance behaviour of the plume, by taking into account random wind direction variations. A rather sophisticated approach is used, in particular, when evaluating food <b>contamination</b> and <b>doses,</b> allowing also for consideration of a possible ban of food consumption. Several tens of functions are on hand of the user who can take full advantage of the very flexible tools introduced in the recent version 7 of Mathematica.

40|$|Abstract The Joint Research Centre of Ispra, {{one of the}} {{research}} Sites belonging to the European Commission, Directorate General JRC, {{was created in the}} late ' 50 s, in order to steer European research on nuclear industry. It currently hosts numerous nuclear facilities, some of which are maintained in operation, while others were shutdown in past years or are currently being decommissioned. Since 2003, a Radiopharmaceutical facility has been set up at the JRC Cyclotron Laboratory, in collaboration with General Electric Healthcare, for the production and commercialization of [18 F]FDG. This Radiopharmaceutical Laboratory has been the first FDG production facility to be officially authorized by the Italian Health Ministry and has been operating since 2003 without any interruption. During these years, some upgrades in the capacity and maximum activity produced by the Lab have been performed. Two different beam lines and one irradiation vault have been devoted to FDG production in order to increase the production capability. The paper, thus, is a review of Radiation Protection activities performed in the Lab during its years of operation and in particular the distribution of the dose related to the activity and the daily personal dose trend, subdivided between FDG production and Quality Control (QC), will be shown and discussed. Further, a recent internal <b>contamination</b> <b>dose</b> assessment campaign will be presented and the results discussed. JRC. C. 1 -Nuclear Decommissionin...|$|E
40|$|The {{near surface}} build up {{characteristics}} of photon and electron beams used for radiotherapy treatment of cancer patients have been studied. For {{the measurement of}} skin dose various detectors were developed. The Attix parallel plate ionisation chamber {{was used as the}} benchmark chamber for in phantom dose build up measurements. Extrapolation of thermoluminescent dosimeters readings were employed to produce invivo results, within the first 0. 1 cm of tissue. A metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) system provided on line integral dosimetry. Radiochromic film was employed as an off-axis skin dose measurement. Neodymium Iron Boron rare earth lanthanide magnets were tested for their ability remove electron contamination from photon beams produced by a linear accelerator. Results show a reduced surface and build up dose. For a 20 cm x 20 cm field size at 100 cm source surface distance (SSD) using a 0. 6 cm perspex block tray, percentage surface dose is 18 % and 32 % with and without the magnetic field applied respectively at 6 MV. A helium/air replacement system has been developed which enhances the skin sparing properties of megavoltage photon beams by replacing 25 cm of air above the phantom with helium. By combining the magnetic and helium devices the percentage surface dose is 9 % of maximum. This is due to the elimination of low energy electron contamination normally generated in the air column. Monte Carlo simulations were performed in the build up region. Using experimental and Monte Carlo generated data as input, a model has been developed to predict central axis build up dose for 6 MV photons. This is performed by separating dose components produced by i) photons scattered by the phantom and ii) electron <b>contamination.</b> <b>Dose</b> deposition changes depend on field size, source surface distance (SSD), angle of incidence, beam modifying devices (block trays, blocks and wedges) and patient geometry.

40|$|Introduction: In {{clinical}} electron beams, most of bremsstrahlung {{radiation is}} produced by various linac head structures. This bremsstrahlung radiation dose {{is influenced by the}} geometry and construction of every component of the linac treatment head structures. Thus, it can be expected that the amount of the contaminated photon dose due to bremsstrahlung radiation varies among different linacs, even for the same electron beam energy. The aims of this study were to simulate the NEPTUN 10 PC linac electron beams and to calculate the photon <b>contamination</b> <b>dose</b> due to bremsstrahlung radiation in these beams using a Monte Carlo method. Materials and methods: A NEPTUN 10 PC linac was simulated in its electron mode using the BEAMnrc code. This linac can provide three electron beam energies of 6, 8 and 10 MeV. Detailed information required for the simulation, including the geometry and materials of various components of the linac treatment head, was provided by the vender. For all simulations, the cut-off energies for electron and photon transport were set at ECUT= 0. 521 MeV and PCUT= 0. 010 MeV, respectively. The KS statistical test was used for validation of the simulated models. Then, relevant bremsstrahlung radiation doses for the three electron beam energies of the linac were calculated for the reference field using the Monte Carlo method.    Results: The KS test showed a good agreement between the calculated values (resulting from the simulations) and the measured ones. The results showed that the amount of contaminated photon dose due to bremsstrahlung radiation from various components of the simulated linac at the surface of the phantom was between 0. 2 %- 0. 5 % of the maximum dose for the three electron beam energies. Conclusion:  Considering the good agreement between the measured and simulated data, it can be concluded that the simulation method as well as the calculated bremsstrahlung doses have been made at a good level of accuracy and precision. The results {{of this study indicate that}} photon contamination in the NEPTUN 10 PC electron beams is not significant. Therefore, it seems that this linac can be used for total skin electron irradiation...|$|E

40|$|Antibiotic {{decontamination}} of {{the digestive}} tract can suppress or eliminate all microorganisms in this tract that {{are sensitive to the}} antibiotics used for decontamination. Experimental work in animals has indicated that colonization resistance (CR) decreases to extremely low values during decontamination {{as a result of the}} suppression of the anaerobic fraction of the intestinal flora. This renders the decontaminated individual extremely sensitive to colonization by microorganisms that are resistant to the antibiotics used for decontamination. Colonization of the gastrointestinal tract will follow even very low <b>contamination</b> <b>doses</b> and the contaminating microorganisms can then reach abnormally high concentrations. This results in invasion of the host, which can be fatal when the individual has a lowered resistance to infection. Experiments in sublethally irradiated mice indicate that implantation of an anaerobic intestinal flora prior to actual reconventionalization decreases the risk of infection. If recolonization of the intestines by anaerobes that contribute to CR is left to circumstantial contamination, a recently decontaminated individual with a weak defense capacity may become contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms before the CR has become reestablished. These more pathogenic microbes may then establish colonies and cause an infection. Experiences with recolonization of patients and animals with a mixture of anaerobic bacteria are described.

40|$|Because of {{increasing}} resistance of Eimeria spp. against anticoccidials, objections of consumers and legislative restrictions against medicated feed in de EU {{it is necessary}} to develop new strategies against coccidiosis. The severity of the disease is often (partially) dependent on the initial <b>contamination</b> <b>dose,</b> which has a great influence on infection dynamics within a flock. Obtaining insight into (influencing) the dynamics of Eimeria in a population is essential for optimizing and evaluating control strategies. 	For this purpose two transmission experiments where carried out, in a group of 20 broilers. One SPF broiler was orally inoculated on day 2 with 5 sporulated oocysts of E. acervulina, placed in a gelatinous capsule. On day 3, the inoculated animal was placed in a 1000 cm 2 litter pen with 19 non-inoculated contact birds. From day 6 to day 30 (Experiment 1) or day 31 (Experiment 2), each bird was placed in a cat transport cage during one hour per day, to produce a single dropping. Number of oocysts per gram of faeces (OPG) of the single droppings was determined, using the McMaster technique. Sedimentation flotation technique was carried out when samples where negative or when a negative result was expected. 	The inoculated bird tested positive in both techniques on day 7, in both experiments. In Experiment 1 the inoculated bird tested positive during 2 days, in Experiment 2 during 1 day. Oocyst excretion in contact birds in Experiment 1 started on day 12 (n= 1), day 13 (n= 14), day 14 (n= 3) or on day 16 (n= 1). In Experiment 2, oocyst excretion in contact birds started at day 12 (n= 4), day 13 (n= 6), day 14 (n= 4), day 15 (n= 2), day 17 (n= 2) or on day 18 (n= 1). 	Contact birds that shedded oocysts before day 16 (C 1 -animals) where infected by uptake of oocysts shedded by the inoculated bird. Animals who shedded oocysts from day 16 (C 2 -animals) where most likely infected by uptake of oocysts shedded by formerly infected contact birds. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) of oocyst output of these C 2 -animals is higher than the AUC of the C 1 -animals. The peaks in oocysts output of C 2 -animals is also higher than the peaks of C 1 -animals. 	These results show that not all the animals of a flock get infected at the same time, but some animals get infected by the contact birds of the first generation. Also, C 2 -birds shedded more oocysts than the C 1 -birds. This build up of infectious oocysts can result in high infectious doses for the following generations of susceptible contact birds and might cause severe clinical signs. These results have increased the understanding of the infection dynamics of an Eimeria infection in a flock. This can make a contribution towards the development of better control strategies...|$|E

The resistance of these enzymes to cop-per pollution was also estimated. Soil samples were contaminated with copper chloride. The experiment was carried out in five replications, in two series. The first series was performed on uncropped soil and the second one – on cropped soil. The experimental plants were oat, spring rape and yellow lupine. The activity of soil enzymes was determined in the analyzed samples on the 25 th and the 50 th day of the experiment. The results of the experiment showed that copper <b>contamination</b> in <b>doses</b> of 150 mg to 450 mg⋅kg- 1 soil significantly inhibits soil’s biochemical activity. The sensitivity of the tested enzymes to copper was determined in the following order: alkaline phosphatase> arylsulfatase> acid phosphatase> β-glucosidase.

For urease and phosphatase activities, the ED values for Cd and Ni increased after application of sewage sludge to soil, indicating a decrease in Cd and Ni toxicity. The other two enzymes (β-glucosidase and protease-BAA) were less sensitive to Cd or Ni contamination, and it was more difficult to determine whether addition of sewage sludge had affected the inhibition of these enzymes by the heavy metals.

40|$|Radioactive wastes require {{strict rules}} for {{manipulation}} with them {{due to the}} hazards for the human health and environment, not excluding the hazards during their internal transport. The article deals with the transport of packing unit inside {{of the company and}} it proposes the possible alternatives so that meet the limit conditions and reduce the manipulation time with the radioactive material in the packing unit. The packing unite isolates fixated liquid waste from the environment while it also serves as protection. There are also important external radiation characteristics of package unit, which consist of measurable values of the scratch <b>contamination</b> surface and <b>dose</b> power on the surface of package unit. Thus, the paper is aimed to point out the necessity of the logistics during manipulation with the package unit in the process of internal transport so that the dose power of exposed employees would achieve the lowest possible level and meet the strict limits in a full extent...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of soil <b>contamination</b> with copper <b>doses</b> of 0, 150, 300, and 450 mg·kg - 1 of soil and the application of zeolite, raw and modified halloysite on the biomass of spring rapeseed and the content of nitrogen compounds and macronutrients in the above-ground parts of the tested plants. The content of macronutrients in plants was determined spectrophotometrically. The applied soil amendments and copper doses led to significant variations in the concentrations of the analyzed nutrients in spring rapeseed. Zeolite and halloysite were most effective in increasing the average above-ground biomass of the tested plants. Zeolite had a beneficial effect on the content of total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus in the above-ground parts of spring rapeseed. Raw halloysite increased the content of sodium and calcium, whereas modified halloysite contributed to an increase in the nitrogen, potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium content of the tested plants...|$|R
40|$|Concepts {{for deep}} {{geological}} disposal of highly radioactive waste from nuclear reactors consider the host rock to {{be a major}} barrier to transport of radionuclides that may possibly be released from the repository to the biosphere. This has required development of hydraulic (”geohydrological”) models for predicting possible groundwater <b>contamination</b> and <b>dose</b> rates. They are based on very limited information on the constitution and properties of the large rock mass, making the sophisticated models hypothetic and uncertain in calculation of groundwater flow and transport of dissolved species. Considerable effort has been put in hydraulic modeling of groundwater movement during and after the next glaciation cycle, largely disregarding from possible long-term impact of tectonic movements and seismic events on the transport paths. The rheological performance of the “near-field” rock has been assessed without considering that the rock stresses will cause spalling and fracturing of the rock immediately surrounding the waste containers, which produce heat and generate thermally induced stresses. Modelers of the hydro/mechanical performance of the near-field rock mass tend to neglect the existence of excavation disturbance of the rock around tunnels and drifts, which means that the evolution of groundwater flow in the “near-field” and “far-field” in a time perspective that includes at least one glaciation event has not yet been adequately predicted. In conclusion, one must rely on the engineered barriers, waste containers and embedding clay, for safe disposal of highly radioactive waste and take the rock to serve merely as a mechanical protection of the “chemical apparatus”.

40|$|Objective: A new {{protocol}} {{is described}} {{for assessing the}} efficacy of the dispenser of some packaging systems (PSs) of preservative-free cosmetic products in protecting both their contained formula and their delivered doses. Methods: Practically, aiming at mimicking contacts with a non-sterile skin or fingers, the dispensing system is put into contact with a pre-contaminated fabric by a standardized colonization of P. aeruginosa. Results: When applied to three different types of packaging, results show clear differences in both criteria between these conditioning articles, that is variable efficacies in protecting the contained product and the delivered doses, knowing that the first aspect is of paramount importance. Conclusion: The proposed protocol is proved being able to discriminate between different PSs and provides information on strong and weak features of certain types dispensing technologies prone to efficiently decrease either the <b>dose</b> <b>contamination</b> or to prevent contamination in reaching the contained product. Therefore, the proposed protocol can contribute to an objective selection of a PS for protecting a cosmetic care product with a low content of preservative or preservative free...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} in Sweden aimed at studying the possible genetic effects of the Chernobyl fallout on wild small mammals. The bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus Schreb.) were obtained from three differently contaminated areas in Sweden and, for control, in an area with negligible contamination by fallout. Radionuclide determinations to assess the content of 137 Cs and mutagenicity tests (bone marrow micronucleus test and sperm abnormality assay) were performed. The results obtained showed a positive correlation between the increase of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MPCE/ 1000 PCE) and both 137 Cs content in muscle and in soil <b>contamination.</b> The estimated <b>doses</b> absorbed by the animals were far lower than those required for the same effect in laboratory experiments. An explanation of this discrepancy between dose and measured biological effect is not available, yet similar results have been repeatedly reported after the Chernobyl accident and should be a matter for further discussion. An increased frequency of micronucleated cells might occur at minimal dose gradients, and the micronucleus test appears to be a valid tool to show such effects...|$|R
5000|$|TeGenero has {{apologized to}} the {{families}} involved, insists that these effects were completely unexpected, and said that all protocols have been followed. An investigation by the UK drug regulator reported that the reaction was not due to <b>contamination</b> of the <b>dose,</b> or an incorrect dose being administered, but suggested that the problem was due to [...] "on target" [...] effects of the drug. Criticism has been raised that six participants were given the drug {{in such a short}} time, which is against the recommendations of standard literature. Despite this, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has confirmed that they had approved the trial, including the protocol of giving the dose to all men within a short time. It appears the MHRA approved a protocol involving the doses being administered between 8.00h-10.00h (i.e., 2 hours). One of the placebo-receiving participants has explained the doses were given with 2-minute intervals. Even though the participants were dosed with short intervals, this is not a deviation from the approved protocol.|$|R
40|$|The spent {{nuclear fuel}} (SNF) and {{radioactive}} waste (RAW) storage facility at Andreeva Bay shore technical base (STB) {{is one of the}} largest and most hazardous nuclear legacy sites in northwest Russia. Originally commissioned in the 1960 s the facility now stores large amounts of SNF and RAW associated with the Russian Northern Fleet of nuclear powered submarines. The objective of the present study was to map ambient gamma dose rates throughout the facility, in particular at a number of specific sites where SNF and RAW are stored. The data presented here are taken from a Norwegian-Russian collaboration enabling the first publication in the scientific literature of the complete survey of on-site dose rates. Results indicate that elevated gamma dose rates are found primarily at discrete sites within the facility; maximum dose rates of up to 1000 mu Sv/h close to the ground (0. 1 m) and up to 3000 mu Sv/h at 1 m above ground were recorded, higher doses at the I m height being indicative primarily of the presence of contaminated equipment as opposed to ground <b>contamination.</b> Highest <b>dose</b> rates were measured at sites located in the immediate vicinity of buildings used for storing SNF and sites associated with storage of solid and liquid radioactive wastes. Elevated dose rates were also observed near the former channel of a small brook that became heavily contaminated as a result of radioactive leaks from the SNF storage at Building 5 starting in 1982. Isolated patches of elevated dose rates were also observed throughout the STB. A second paper detailing the radioactive soil contamination at the site is published in this issue of Journal of Environmental Radioactivity. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
