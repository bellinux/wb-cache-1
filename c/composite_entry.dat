30|$|To quantitatively {{understand}} {{the removal of}} fillers from composites, polyethylene composites containing graphite, calcium carbonate, starch, and cellulose, were used for an extraction experiment, and {{the separation of the}} components was confirmed by the amount of recovered resins from extraction solutions and remaining fillers on the extraction thimbles. Recovery rates for resins from six <b>composites</b> (<b>Entry</b> 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 10) ranged from 73.6 % to 75.2 %, and the recovery rates for the remaining fillers ranged from 23.9 % to 25.5 % (Recovery rates used in this paper were calculated based on the total sample weight of the composites. The theoretical maximum recovery rates of resin and filler in this paper are 75 % and 25 %, respectively). These results were almost equivalent to the component percentage of the composites, and could satisfy our protocol when handling loss of fine precipitates and uneven quality of the composites are taken into account. In the case of the composites containing solvent-soluble additives (DBDPE, Entry 4 and Entry 10), the recovery rate of resins (Entry 4, 73.7 % and Entry 8, 75.2 %, respectively) were the same as the composites containing graphite or calcium carbonate, although the recovery rates of the additives were apparently null. This indicates that the additives that dissolved at elevated temperatures still remained in the extraction solution at room temperature and were not incorporated into the resin precipitates. From the composites containing starch or cellulose, additives, which may intentionally be added in order to raise the apparent biobased carbon content of plastic products, polyethylene resins were successfully isolated at the theoretical recovery rates (Entry 9, 74.9 % and Entry 10, 74.6 %).|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to develop a}} grammar model of Japanese within the {{framework}} of Dynamic Syntax (Cann et al. 2005, Kempson et al. 2001), with special reference to constructions that involve the nominaliser no : clefts and certain kinds of relatives. The more general theoretical position which it aims to defend is that an account of these constructions in terms of ‘language dynamics’ is preferable to other ‘static’ approaches currently available. What is here meant by ‘language dynamics,’ in a nutshell, is the time-linear processing of a string and attendant growth of an interpretation. First, I shall motivate, and articulate, an integrated account of the two types of no - nominalisation. These two classes are uniformly modelled as an outcome of incremental semantic-tree growth. The analysis is corroborated by naturally-occurring data extracted from the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ). Moreover, novel data with regard to coordination are accounted for without losing uniformity. Second, the <b>composite</b> <b>entry</b> of no and the topic marker wa handles the two types of clefts uniformly. This account fits well with the CSJ findings. New data concerning case-marking of foci are explained in terms of whether an unfixed relation in a semantic tree is resolvable in incremental processing. The account also solves the island-puzzle without abandoning uniformity. As a further confirmation, the analysis is extendable to stripping/sluicing, making some novel predictions on case-marking patterns. Third, the entry of no characterises free relatives and change relatives in a unitary manner. Furthermore, the <b>composite</b> <b>entry</b> of no and a case particle predicts a vast range of properties of head-internal relatives, including new data (e. g., negation in the relative clause, locality restriction on the Relevancy Condition). In sum, the thesis presents a realistic, integrated, and empirically preferable model of Japanese. Some consequences stand out. The various new data reported are beneficial theory-neutrally. Formal aspects of Dynamic Syntax are advanced. The insights brought by a language dynamics account challenge the standard, static conception of grammar.

The other half of the students were former para-teachers, who were not selected on the basis of entry scores, but the number of years of teaching experience. The remaining para-teachers in the state, who did not fit into the BTC training programme, were to be trained on a distance learning Open University programme. Same caste and female quotas applied to the former para-teachers.|$|E

40|$|Background In 2006 the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, (RCSI), {{introduced}} {{the first four}} year Graduate Entry Programme (GEP) in medicine in Ireland in line with national policy to broaden access to medical education. One concern considered at the time, was whether the GEP students could be trained to the same standard as their undergraduate Direct Entry Programme (DEP, five/ six year duration) counterparts in the shorter time frame. Since students from both cohorts undertake the same examinations {{in the final two}} years, it is possible to directly compare GEP vs DEP outcomes. The primary aim of the current study was to analyse the comparative performance of GEP and DEP students undergoing these examinations between 2008 and 2013. MethodsScores from five assessments performed during the final two years were transformed to z scores for each student and 4 scores for the penultimate year were summed to create a unit weighted composite score. The resultant scores for each of the two years were used to assess the comparative performance of GEP vs DEP cohorts and to perform sub-cohort analyses of GEP outcomes. ResultsIn all cohorts/years examined, evidence demonstrated significantly better assessment outcomes for the GEP group for the final two years¿ examinations as compared with the DEP group. In all but one cohort examined, this advantage was retained when nationality factors were excluded. Further analyses showed no difference in outcomes between GEP students having science vs. non-science backgrounds and or between those from EU vs non-EU backgrounds. Finally, data suggested weak correlations between total <b>composite</b> scores and <b>entry</b> scores in American (r¿=¿ 0. 15) and Australian (r¿=¿ 0. 08) medical school admissions tests. ConclusionsWe have shown {{for the first time in}} Ireland, that graduate-entry students perform at least as well, or even better, than a corresponding undergraduate-entry group. Moreover, having a scientific background on entry to the GEP confers no advantage in final assessments. These data provide evidence of the viability of the graduate entry route into medical education in Ireland...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of MAED project is the {{creation}} of an interactive virtual database which can be consulted, and the staging of a correlated physical museum of materials. This museum is mainly focused on the architecture and the design that have the main purpose of creating a permanent and continuously in progress university structure for research and teaching. The research originates from the understanding of the fundamental role of materials in planning, executive and recovery processes of architecture and design. It studies the connections existing between the multiple features and spheres of interest of materials, in order to optimise their knowledge, which {{is at the same time}} particular and global. This knowledge will be transmitted through the explorative devices of MAED project. The research results are in particular directed to researchers and students, and they are addressed to an integrated approach towards materials, specifically to the interest towards the complementarity between the physical and perceptual dimensions of architectural products and design objects. The research final choice has been to operate a first classification of the exploratory action, starting from the materials according to UNI norms. It is not possible to refer to a classification that allows to simply and exhaustively indicate all kinds of existing materials. So, we have referred to the most used classification, which proposes to subdivide the materials that have a technological interest, on the base of the characteristic chemical bond, in three main classes: metal, ceramic and polymeric materials. Another class has been added to these three classes: the class of composite materials, which are made through the combination of two or more materials belonging to the three main classes. The material summary table refers to the periodic table of the elements, also from the iconographic point of view. The need of univocally defining the structure of the relationships between the main components of MAED computer database and physical museum, has worked on some key entries/words/links which are dynamically and physically interrelated through specific connections. These connections represent the basic concept of the whole research project. Considering technological criteria and manufacturing and production processes, we have identified the main voices that have to be correlated to the materials inserted in the MAED logical-conceptual structure (manufacturing processes and impacts during the production phase, characterizing requirements and processes concerning spin-off, environmental evaluations, etc…). The definition of a base criterion that could inspire MAED conceptual philosophy on a single material, was able to improve some starting schematic distinctions, deducing precise entries for the database mock-up. Moreover, it was able to change other distinctions, like the question of composite materials, which was dealt since the preliminary phases of the taxonomic investigation. At the same time, some questions have lost their relevance. One of these, is the very debated question about starting from the glass or one of its elements, the sand, starting from the brick or the clay; at last, it was declared the shared belief of choosing the prime reference key: the base material. Browsing the computer database, starting from material or going back to it, we will be able to consult a dedicated file, named base material, which illustrates its mechanical and physical chemical properties, manufacturing processes, field of application in architecture and design. Gaining knowledge through the outcomes of the various phases of experimentation and conception, we have constituted and defined a database ‘architecture’, which was also transferred in the organisation of MAED Physical Museum. This architecture, starting from the base material entries and, as an option from these, the <b>composite</b> materials <b>entries,</b> has linked them to the entries concerning: technical elements, technological units, architectural organisms and architectural units. Symmetrically, starting from the common root of the technical elements and the technological units, we have interrelated the following entries: design components, design categories and design units. The possibilities of interrogation and subsequent surfing start from an initial common level which individuates three different explorative accesses: materials, architecture, design, which are qualified through their differentiation in relation to the modalities of the interrogative path along two directions. One of these directions, accessing from the material key, requires and finds the sequence of the basic and technical manufacturing which, together with the environmental evaluations, lead to the technical elements. Later, this direction identifies the technological manufacturing which is connected to the technological units and, from here, to the architectural organisms, concretely exemplified by the architectural units. Therefore, we can imagine a first vertical path from the bottom to the top; the extremities of this path are materials and architectural units. Similarly, concerning to design, starting from technological units we have the options relative to design components, design categories and design units. The other possibility which is shared by the access keys architecture and design, has a double analogy: it establishes a similar level of interrogation, which differentiates itself through the choice of the key word, instituting a descending path. In this case, we can say that the interrogation follows an opposite direction, from the top to the bottom, that is from architectural units, or design units, through the steps reread in the opposite direction, until it arrives, or returns, to the materials. So, the extremities of the explorative path prove to be inverted in their proceeding from the materialized exemplification, architectural units or design units, through the progressive discretization of the components, until the identification of the constituent base materials.
