60|$|This idea worried her a little, but {{she walked}} {{on to the}} corner, where she noticed a street <b>car</b> <b>stop</b> to let some people on. The wax lady, still {{determined}} to do as others did, also boarded the car and sat down quietly in a corner.|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} {{it seemed that}} the great car would turn over into the sump, but the next instant it was past. It struck the bottom of the hollow a mighty wallop, and bounced and upended to the steep pitch of the climb. Miss Drexel, seized by {{inspiration}} or desperation, with a quick movement stripped off her short, corduroy tramping-skirt, and, looking very lithe and boyish in slender-cut pongee bloomers, ran along the sand and dropped the skirt for a foothold for the slowly revolving wheels. Almost, but not quite, did the <b>car</b> <b>stop,</b> then, gathering way, with the others running alongside and shoving, it emerged on the hard road.|$|E
60|$|But {{a journey}} to Boston is not entirely an {{experience}} of bitterness. On the contrary, {{there are many things}} besides the mutual amiability of these beautiful martyrs which relieve its tedium and horrors. A whole car-full of people, brought into the closest contact with one another, yet in the absence of introductions never exchanging a word, each being so sufficient to himself as to need no social stimulus whatever, is certainly an impressive and stately spectacle. It is a beautiful day, say; but far be it from me to intimate as much to my neighbor, who plainly would rather die than thus commit himself with me, and who, in fact, would well-nigh strike me speechless with surprise if he did so. If there is any necessity for communication, as with the conductor, we essay first to express ourselves by gesture, and then utter our desires with a certain hollow and remote effect, which is not otherwise to be described. I have sometimes tried to speak above my breath, when, being about to leave the car, I have made a virtue of offering my place to the prettiest young woman standing, but I have found it impossible; the genius loci, whatever it was, suppressed me, and I have gasped out my sham politeness as in a courteous nightmare. The silencing influence is quite successfully resisted by none but the tipsy people who occasionally ride out with us, and call up a smile, sad as a gleam of winter sunshine, to our faces by their artless prattle. I remember one eventful afternoon that we were all but moved to laughter by the gayeties of such a one, who, even after he had ceased to talk, continued to amuse us by falling asleep, and reposing himself against the shoulder of the lady next him. Perhaps it is in acknowledgment of the agreeable variety they contribute to horse-car life, that the conductor treats his inebriate passengers with such unfailing tenderness and forbearance. I have never seen them molested, though I have noticed them in the indulgence of many eccentricities, and happened once even to see one of them sit down in a lady's lap. But that was on the night of Saint Patrick's day. Generally all avoidable indecorums are rare in the horse-cars, though during the late forenoon and early afternoon, in the period of lighter travel, I have found curious figures there:--among others, two old women, in the old-clothes business, one of whom was dressed, not very fortunately, in a gown with short sleeves, and inferentially a low neck; a mender of umbrellas, with many unwholesome whity-brown wrecks of umbrellas about him; a peddler of soap, who offered cakes of it to his fellow-passengers at a discount, apparently for friendship's sake; and a certain gentleman with a pock-marked face, and a beard dyed an unscrupulous purple, who sang himself a hymn all the way to Boston, and who gave me no sufficient reason for thinking him a sea- captain. Not far {{from the end of the}} Long Bridge, there is apt to be a number of colored ladies waiting to get into the car, or to get out of it,--usually one solemn mother in Ethiopia, and two or three mirthful daughters, who find it hard to suppress a sense of adventure, and to keep in the laughter that struggles out through their glittering teeth and eyes, and who place each other at a disadvantage by divers accidental and intentional bumps and blows. If they are to get out, the old lady is not certain of the place where, and, after making the <b>car</b> <b>stop,</b> and parleying with the conductor, returns to her seat, and is mutely held up to public scorn by one taciturn wink of the conductor's eye.|$|E

50|$|Located roughly at Fisher Avenue and Arthur Kill Road on {{the main}} line, it is at grade level with side {{platforms}} approximately 80 ft long that can hold only one car. Former operations before the station closed only had the last <b>car</b> <b>stop</b> at the platform. Access to the northbound platform is via the short dead-end Tracy Avenue off of Arthur Kill Road between Fisher and Wood Avenues, while the southbound platform is reached from an entrance on Ellis Street. An overpass links both platforms. The overpass is still accessible, but the stairways leading down to the platform are walled off. One can see the original, pre-1990s SIRT station components on this line—steel corrugated walls, overpasses and original 4 ft-high station pipe railings with faded signs.|$|E

It soon transpired that the car involved in the accident, which did not stop, was owned by Hildebrand Harmsworth, brother of Sir Alfred Harmsworth, owner of the Daily Mail, and driven by Hildebrand's chauffeur. The passengers were Hildebrand Harmsworth's political supporters. The chauffeur was eventually sentenced to a jail term of six months hard labour and his passengers censured for failing to insist that the <b>car</b> <b>stop</b> after the accident.

5000|$|Identification {{is usually}} {{supposed}} to be largely unconscious: a reader may be aware that she likes a given character, but not that she actually sees that character as an alter ego, a version of her, or a projection of her aspirations for herself. It {{would be a mistake}} to think all heroes foster identification, or that all villains inhibit identification—many, perhaps even most, characters elicit some degree of identification on the part of the reader or spectator. In film, Alfred Hitchcock exploited the traits of casual identification with specific moments, even when the character was villainous. In Psycho (1960), Hitchcock explained that as the character Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) was disposing of the car containing Marion Crane's body in a swamp, for a brief moment he had the <b>car</b> <b>stop</b> sinking. [...] "When Perkins is looking at the car sinking in the pond... the public are thinking, 'I hope it goes all the way down!' It's a natural instinct." ...|$|E
