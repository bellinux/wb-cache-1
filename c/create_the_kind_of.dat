25|$|Though some {{television}} series were already being filmed in Hollywood, most used the single-camera format familiar from movies, {{with a laugh}} track added to comedies to simulate audience response. Arnaz and I Love Lucy creator Jess Oppenheimer decided, however, that Lucy needed to work {{in front of an}} audience to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> comic energy she had displayed on radio. The idea of a film studio that could accommodate an audience was a new one for the time, as fire safety regulations made it difficult to allow an audience in a studio. Arnaz and Oppenheimer were lucky enough to find the financially struggling General Service Studios located on Las Palmas Avenue in Hollywood. Studio owner Jimmy Nasser was eager to accommodate the Desilu company and allowed them, with financial backing of CBS, to renovate two of his studios so that they could accommodate an audience and be in compliance with local fire laws.|$|E

Originally, however, the script called for both the protagonists and the antagonists to be African Americans, and the main protagonist to be a [...] "Louis Farrakhan-like" [...] character. Gordon later rewrote the script because he realized [...] "black anti-Semitism is a very subtle and difficult subject and not what I needed in my dramatic structure."

From {{the beginning of}} the game, players are put in a world where they are left to roam, steal, quest and explore, without necessarily {{following the}} main quest. Lead designer Ken Rolston, asked prior to Morrowinds release what he thought were the [...] "core, untouchable design elements" [...] of the Elder Scrolls series which [...] "set them apart from other games," [...] responded immediately: [...] "Free-form experience." [...] In Rolston's view, the game's central plot is a chance to introduce the player to a cross-current of conflicting factions, background themes, and to the characters of the game, rather than the primary focus of the player's experience.
