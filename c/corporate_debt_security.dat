40|$|A {{striking}} {{development in}} the euro area financial markets since 1999 was {{the rapid growth of}} the <b>corporate</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> market. This paper offers a first empirical examination of this market since the introduction of the euro using macroeconomic data. It is shown that <b>corporate</b> <b>debt</b> issuance is positively correlated with mergers and acquisitions and with industrial production, taken as a proxy of investment expenditures or working capital. Substitution with other sources of finance is shown to be related to cost differentials. The timing and size of these explanatory factors of <b>corporate</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> issuance differ across maturity. The empirical findings also show that corporate bond spreads lag short-term interest rates and lead real economic activity. All this suggests that the euro area corporate bond market, though still young, is informative for monetary policy and may develop into a significant link in the euro area monetary policy transmission process.

40|$|The {{present study}} seeks {{to analyze the}} demand for liquid assets under the {{assumption}} that holdings of money, U. S. Treasuries, and <b>corporate</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> directly contribute to investors utility. Specifically, the representative agent' s utility function includes a separate argument denoted as "liquidity services" which depends on the level of liquid asset holdings. First, this paper presents results from nonparametric tests of investors behavior - namely tests for utility maximization, and tests for weak separability. I find that monthly per capita data on consumption, money balances, and holdings of U. S. Treasuries, and <b>corporate</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> are consistent with utility maximization and weak separability. The second part of the empirical analysis employs Generalized Method of Moments to estimate coefficients of Euler equations which are derived from a variety of specifications of the representative agent s modified utility function. Further, to find the most suitable functional form, parameter estimates are compared across different specifications and different data sets. However, only the most restrictive utility specification yields parameter estimates which are relatively robust to the choice of data, while in some cases the estimates differ from those known from the literature...|$|R

The model provides a number of interesting new insights about pricing and hedging <b>corporate</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities.</b> For example, {{we find that the}} correlation between default risk and the interest rate has a significant effect on the properties of the credit spread. Using Moody's corporate bond yield data, we find that credit spreads are negatively related to interest rates and that durations of risky bonds depend on the correlation with interest rates.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} jump-diffusion model, in closed form, to price <b>corporate</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities,</b> senior and junior, {{with the same}} {{maturity}} and violation of the absolute priority rule. We take the structural approach that the firm's asset value follows a jump-diffusion process in a stochastic interest rate economy. Default occurs only if the firm value at the maturity of the <b>corporate</b> <b>debts</b> {{is less than the}} sum of the prespecified face values. Unlike previous models in the structural approach, our model is consistent with the current term structures of credit spreads for both senior and junior debts. In particular, it captures realistic short maturity credit spreads observed in the market. The key idea is to allow the jump intensity to be a time-dependent function. As an application, valuation of credit spread options is presented. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{identify}} and evaluate the changes, which have taken place in the period of 2000 – 2011 on the short-term <b>corporate</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> market, and therefore in this segment of the money market, which mainly contributes to more effective companies’ fundraising and efficient financial capital allocation, supporting the economic growth. The study indicates that short-term commercial securities market, despite implemented institutional initiatives, remains still weakly integrated part of the money market in euro area. The global financial crisis has caused significant differentiation of credit risk on this market, which was reflected in the declining of capitalization of this segment of the money market.

30|$|While {{there is}} a large amount of {{literature}} concentrating on the estimation of the cost of equity (for a recent overview, see, for example, Da et al. (2012)), a little attention has been focused on the cost of debt. It is common practice to simply use the yield to maturity of the company’s <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> as an approximation. 1 However, using the yield to maturity neglects the risk of default, and is, therefore, only a reasonable approximation when default risk is small. Instead, cost of capital, defined as opportunity costs, is the required expected return to capital suppliers, as described, for example, in the textbook of Brealey et al. (2016). While the cost of equity is the expected return to stockholders, the cost of debt is the expected return to bondholders. When the debt is risky, meaning, when {{there is a}} non-zero probability of default, the expected return is not identical to the yield to maturity of <b>corporate</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities,</b> because the risk of possible loss {{in the event of a}} default lowers the expected return.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{information}} contained in the yields of <b>corporate</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> using a structural credit risk model. As previous studies have found, credit risk is not the only factor that affects corporate yield spreads. The aim is to decompose credit spreads, using a structural model of credit risk, into credit and non-credit risk components. The contribution relative to the existing literature is the use of contemporaneous forward-looking information on equity risk premia and equity value uncertainty in a structural model. In particular, implied equity risk premia from a three-stage dividend discount model that incorporates analysts' long-term earnings forecasts are used, together with implied measures of equity value uncertainty from option prices. The paper examines the evolution of the different components of spreads across time as well as the effect of particular events. It also analyses the relationship between the derived components and other financial variables, such as swap spreads and the equity risk premium. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this project is to give an {{overview}} of the liquidity and activity in the secondary market for Norwegian <b>debt</b> <b>securities.</b> The second objective is to determine whether the activity and data availability is sufficient to be able construct indicators {{that can be used to}} monitor the state of Norwegian bond market on a regular basis. To this end we examine a detailed data set provided to us by Oslo Børs Informasjon (OBI) containing the complete record of daily trading activity in all exchange listed fixed income securities in Norway over the period 1999 - 2011. Due to the low trading activity in corporate securities and the fact that a large part of trading in <b>corporate</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> is conducted off market (OTC), makes it challenging to produce reliable liquidity indicators. In particular, order-based liquidity measures (such as the bid ask spread), that typically are superior measures of liquidity supply, are in most cases not possible to construct due to the lack of two sided quote observations. On the other hand, due to the reporting rules of all OTC trades to the Oslo Stock Exchange, trade-based measures of liquidity (such as the Amihud ILR) are more informative. ∗The views expressed are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as reflecting those of Norges Bank. ...|$|R
40|$|While much {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} the optimal ratio of a firm’s debt to equity, the “optimal ” or best balance between bond financing and (longer-term) bank financing has scarcely been addressed. This essay examines the principal differences between an economy with a well-developed corporate bond market free from government interference and an economy in which bank financing plays a central role (as in East Asia). When a full-fledged corporate bond market is present, market forces have a much greater opportunity to assert themselves, thereby reducing systemic risk and the probability of a crisis. This is because such an environment is associated with greater accounting transparency, a large community of financial analysts, respected rating agencies, a wide range of <b>corporate</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> and derivatives demanding sophisticated credit analysis, and efficient procedures for corporate reorganization and liquidation. In addition, the richness of available securities will tend to enhance economic welfare, and the market forces at work on the wide array of bond prices are likely to have a strong spillover effect on the health of the banking system as well.

40|$|It {{has often}} been argued during the recent credit crisis that {{commercial}} banks 2 ̆ 019 involvement in investment banking activities might {{have had an impact}} on the intensity of their underwriting standards.

40|$|We examine {{defaulted}} {{bonds of}} predominantly US-based issuers {{who at the}} time of the initial default event had several publicly traded bonds outstanding. We find that in the vast majority of cases bonds of the same issuer and seniority are valued equally or within one dollar by the market, irrespective of their time to maturity. This strongly suggests that the amount recovered in default is best modelled as a fraction of face value at the time of default (RFV) as other assumptions, in general, cannot generate such a payoff pattern in bonds. We argue that this assumption is generated by the institutional framework which affects corporate bond pricing and thus is the only assumption with an underpinning theory. This may have important implications for empirical studies of credit risk which use models that do not incorporate RFV. While it has been remarked in the literature that RFV is often used in practice, up to now there has been little detailed discussion on why this should be the case nor any empirical support for such a hypothesis. In fact, some recent papers show support for alternative recovery assumptions. The results within strengthen the argument that the market may incorporate RFV when valuing <b>corporate</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities.</b> London Business School...|$|R
40|$|<b>Corporate</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> play a {{large part}} in {{financial}} markets and hence accurate modeling of the prices of these securities is integral. Ericsson and Reneby (2005) state that the corporate bond market in the US doubled between 1995 and 2005 and is now larger than the market for US treasuries. Although the theoretical corporate bond pricing literature is vast, very little empirical research to test {{the effectiveness of these}} models has been published. Corporate bond pricing models are split into two families of models. The first, are the structural models which endogenise default by modeling it as an event that may eventuate due to the insolvency of the underlying firm. The second family of models is the newer class of reduced-form models that exogenise default by modeling it as some random process (default intensity). The reduced-form models have been formulated largely due to the empirical failures of the structural family to accurately model prices and spreads. However as Ericsson and Reneby (2005) point out, an inadequate estimation approach may explain the poor performance of the structural models. Structural models are, therefore, the focus of this paper. We, however, do estimate a reduced-form model {{in order to make a}} comparison between the two types of model.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the regulatory framework}} as of December 2003) Abstract: This paper looks at the development and regulation of the fixed income securities market in the United States. The US fixed income market {{is one of the}} oldest and most developed debt markets in the world. It is also one of the most heterogeneous, with the four key market segments – government securities, the securities of government sponsored enterprises, municipal <b>securities,</b> and <b>corporate</b> <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> – all being relatively large and deep. This paper {{describes the}} evolution of fixed income market regulation in the United States, discussing both primary and secondary market regulation. The paper also looks at market integrity issues and the enforcement authority of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which is unusually broad and has played an important role in the effectiveness of its regulation. The paper concludes that the fact that the US fixed income market flourished for many years in the absence of regulation must be seen in a broader legal and regulatory context. While the debt market itself may have been unregulated, it operated within a larger framework of equity market regulation and enforcement, complemented by a long history of bank supervision, that had a significant impact on its development. It is this context that permitted US authorities to adopt regulation in stages, in response to differing demands and priorities. The dynamic nature of the regulation of the US fixed income market – its development in response to market crises [...] underscores the need for regulation to remain responsive to market developments, and to be adapted to domestic constraints...|$|R

40|$|Existing {{models of}} the term {{structure}} of interest rate swap yields assume a unique regime for the data generating process and ascribe variations in swap-Treasury yield spread to default risk or to liquidity premium. However, the interest rate swap market {{has been marked by}} economic events and institutional changes that might have significant effects on the data generating process, and thus on the relationship between the swap spread and its determining factors. We investigate the stability {{of the relationship between the}} swap spread and its determining factors with the structural change econometric techniques of Bai and Perron (1998). The structural change tests produce endogenous break dates and associated confidence intervals. We trace the break dates to events related to liquidity, default, and institutional changes in the swap market. We find that default risk is an important source of variation of the swap spread at the beginning of the sample period, but is relatively less important at the end. Liquidity is, by contrast, more important towards the end of the sample period. Since these results call into question the assumption of one regime, we propose and estimate a joint Treasury and swap term structure model that accommodates regime switching. Evidence from the maximum likelihood estimation provides considerable support for the regime switching model. Consequently, the implied swap spreads may differ greatly across regimes. This finding suggests that the failure to account for regime shifts may result in significant mispricing of <b>corporate</b> <b>debt,</b> mortgage-backed <b>securities,</b> as well as derivatives that increasingly use the swap spread as a benchmark for pricing and hedging...|$|R
