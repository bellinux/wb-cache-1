5000|$|It {{is created}} by adding rennet to buttermilk, {{resulting}} in curd production. This is then formed and cut, before being pressed lightly into a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>mould.</b> These rounds are then submerged in a bath of brine for 24 hours to cause {{the production of a}} rind. Rice flour is used to dust the outside of the cheese, resulting in a white colour for the rind. The cheese ripens quickly, in as little as two weeks. The acid production of the cheese is initially slow, but builds up. This and the low temperature used during production mean that the acid naturally dries out the curd, causing the crumbly texture. The cheese is nicknamed [...] "The Crumblies".|$|E

40|$|The {{mathematical}} {{model of the}} cure of unsaturated polyester resin in <b>cylindrical</b> <b>mould</b> heated with warm air was suggested and derived. The model assumes convective heat transfer through air {{on the wall of}} the mould and conductive heat transfer through the resin. The temperature within the sample changes during the cure process, which is the result of the reaction being exothermal and the process of heat transfer. The addition of the filler changes the thermal properties of the mixture and reduces the amount of heat generated during the reaction in the sample of the same volume, which leads to lower temperature maximums in the center of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>mould.</b> The model was tested with multiple experiments in which the temperature of the resin inside the mould during the cure process was measured. The heat transfer coefficients between the air and wall of the mould with different speeds of air flow were estimated using independent experiments where the glycerol was used instead of resin. Estimated values were compared with known correlations and good agreement was obtained. Using the suggested model, the cure process in the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>mould</b> can be simulated accurately and influents of the heat transfer and reaction rate on the temperature maximums can be studied...|$|E

According to recent studies, Matrix Metaloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors can increase clinical longevity of bonding and decrease leakage. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the amount and pattern of doxycycline release from an experimental dentin adhesive containing this MMP inhibitor. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, specimens containing 0. 25 and 0. 5 loading percent of doxycycline in an experimental monomer were prepared in <b>cylindrical</b> <b>moulds</b> of 12 mm diameter and 2 mm thickness. The adhesive monomer was composed of 12 wt% Bis-GMA, 10 wt% TMPTMA, 28 wt% HEMA and 50 wt% ethanol. Camphorquinone and amine were used as initiators. Results: Addition of 0. 25 and 0. 5 w% doxycycline showed linear release in both groups. Increasing the loading percent of doxycycline caused more release. The release continued during the test period. Conclusion: Doxycycline release was observed from the experimental adhesive.

The EMS material continued to contain large globular particles after isothermal holding. The shear behaviour of the semisolid materials was measured by a direct shear test. The shear resistance was high if the material had a dendritic microstructure, and was reduced after a globular microstructure developed during isothermal holding. The shear strength for the three alloy conditions studied varied with isothermal holding time and this was related to microstructural differences between the alloys...|$|R

The model demonstrates that the shrinkage due to vacancy condensation is an important parameter to regard when predicting crack formation. The centreline segregation was studied, where the contributions from thermal and solidification shrinkage were analysed theoretically and compared with experimental findings. In order to compare macrosegregation in continuous casting and ingot casting, ingots cast with the same steel grade was analysed.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed a homogeneous surface distribution of PCL. PCL was well dispersed throughout the CHT phase as analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The fibers were folded into <b>cylindrical</b> <b>moulds</b> and underwent a thermal treatment to obtain the scaffolds. μCT analysis revealed an adequate porosity, pore size and interconnectivity for tissue engineering applications. The PCL component led to a higher fiber surface roughness, decreased the scaffolds swelling ratio and increased their compressive mechanical properties.

In these mines there are the usual main shafts and galleries, the ozokerite being reached by levels driven along the strike of the deposit. The wax, as it reaches the surface, varies in purity, and, in new workings especially, only hand-picking is needed to separate the pure material. In other cases much earthy matter is mixed with the material, and then the rock or shale having been eliminated by hand-picking, the [...] "wax-stone" [...] is boiled with water in large coppers, when the pure wax rises to the surface. This is again melted without water, and the impurities are skimmed off, the material being then run into slightly conical <b>cylindrical</b> <b>moulds,</b> and thus made into blocks for the market. The crude ozokerite is refined by treatment first with sulfuric acid, and subsequently with charcoal, when the ceresine or cerasin of commerce is obtained.

Fine uniform equiaxed grains are acquired in the whole ingot from the PMF treatment, {{in contrast with the}} coarse columnar grains observed in conventional casting, and the average grain size is refined to 260 µm with a 5 Hz PMF treatment. The mould size also affects the grain refinement and the most suitable inner diameter of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>mould</b> is set at 50 mm. Pulsed magnetic field increases melt convection during solidification, and the violent agitation causes warmer liquid to fracture the tip of columnar dendrites or to break off dendrite branches and promote the formation of an equiaxed structure, with the broken pieces transported into the bulk liquid acting as nuclei...|$|E

The present study aimed to evaluate how acidic pH affects MTA microhardness at different depths. Methods: ProRoot MTA (Dentsply Tulsa Dental, USA) was mixed with sterile water and compacted into <b>cylindrical</b> <b>moulds</b> having an internal diameter of 3 mm and height of 6 mm. Specimens {{were randomly assigned}} to group 1 (G 1, n= 12) or 2 (G 2, n= 12), immediately immersed into buffer solutions at pH values of 7. 4 (G 1) or 4. 4 (G 2) and stored for 24 h. Thereafter, each specimen was cross-sectioned at a depth of 3 mm. HV analysis was performed on the top, on the intermediate (3 mm) and on the bottom surfaces; three indentations per surface were made. The mean HV values were calculated for each group and subjected to repeated measures analysis of variance, paired and independent samples t-tests (p< 0. 05). Results: Top surfaces in G 2 were found to be crumbling, thus HV reading was unfeasible. HV mean values ±SD were: G 1 top 68. 60 ± 16. 48, G 1 intermediate 66. 51 ± 7. 66, G 1 bottom 62. 46 ± 5. 68; G 2 intermediate 56. 41 ± 4. 13, G 2 bottom 61. 33 ± 12, 55. No significant differences were found within each group amongst measured surfaces. Similar HV values were found on bottom surfaces in G 1 and G 2, whilst significantly lower values were recorded in G 2 when comparing intermediate surfaces. Conclusions: A pH value of 4. 4 affected the HV of MTA on the exposed top surface and at a depth of 3 mm. A similar behavior in clinical conditions can be expected when MTA is used as root-end filling material; further clinical studies are needed...|$|R

In the third group, MTA was mixed with and exposed to whole, fresh human blood. These three groups were then duplicated using grey MTA, creating a total of 60 samples. A predetermined amount of MTA and appropriate liquid were triturated in a plastic mixing capsule then subjected to ultrasonic energy after placement in the moulds. After 4 days of incubation, specimens were subjected to compressive strength testing. The surface microstructure of one extra specimen in each group was examined using scanning electron microscopy. Data were subjected to a two-way anova.
