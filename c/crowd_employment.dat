40|$|<b>Crowd</b> <b>employment</b> is a {{new form}} of short term and {{flexible}} employment which has emerged during the past decade. For understanding this new form of employment, it is crucial to understand the underlying motivations of the workforce involved in it. This paper presents the Multidimensional Crowdworker Motivation Scale (MCMS), a scale for measuring the motivation of crowdworkers on micro-task platforms. The scale is theoretically grounded in Self-Determination Theory and tailored specifically to the context of crowdsourced micro-labor. The MCMS was validated on data collected in ten countries and three income groups. Furthermore, measurement invariance tests showed that motivations measured with the MCMS are comparable across countries and income groups. This work constitutes a first step towards understanding the motivations of the international crowd workforce. Comment: 31 pages; corrected typo...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of behavioral and material factors in explaining educational differences in all-cause mortality, {{taking into account the}} overlap between both types of factors. Prospective data were used on 15, 451 participants in a Dutch longitudinal study. Relative hazards of all-cause mortality by educational level were calculated before and after adjustment for behavioral factors (alcohol intake, smoking, body mass index, physical activity, dietary habits) and material factors (financial problems, neighborhood conditions, housing conditions, <b>crowding,</b> <b>employment</b> status, a proxy of income). Mortality was higher in lower educational groups. Four behavioral factors (alcohol, smoking, body mass index, physical activity) and 3 material factors (financial problems, employment status, income proxy) explained part of the educational differences in mortality. With the overlap between both types of factors accounted for, material factors were more important than behavioral factors in explaining mortality differences by educational level. The association between educational level and mortality can be largely explained by material factors.

40|$|In the {{situation}} of rapid population aging, postponing retirement is a timely and effective measure in relieving pressure of old age support. However, many people think that postponing retirement will <b>crowd</b> out youth <b>employment.</b> Using data in China, this paper shows that this judgment cannot be supported by empirical evidence. Using data from 1990 census, 2000 census and 2005 1 % population sample survey, this paper examines the impact of employment of older persons on employment of younger persons. Our OLS estimation results suggest that employment of younger persons is positively instead of negatively correlated with employment of older persons. We further dealt with the potential endogeneity of the OLS estimation by employing two-way fix-effects and TSLS estimation strategies. The results still suggest that increase of employment of older persons will promote rather than depress employment of younger persons. We also found a positive effect of employment of older persons on young workers’ wage. This study suggests that postponing retirement wouldn’t <b>crowd</b> out <b>employment</b> of younger persons. ...|$|R

While public employment affects total output and aggregate disposable income in an a priori ambiguous way, numerical simulations suggest that the relationship may be nonlinear; positive, when public sector is "small" and negative when it is "large".

30|$|The {{expansion}} of the low wage sector in Germany has been criticized because it may distort competition {{at the expense of}} collectively-bargained wages and impose a financial burden on the social security system.

To prevent dumping wages and the crowding out of regular employment the social democratic party supported by the trade unions, the greens and the leftist party proposed a statutory minimum wage of 7.5 € per hour in the last federal election. The main critique against the introduction of a legal minimum wage in Germany concerns the potential employment losses related to it. We discuss new evaluation results for the sectoral minimum wage in the German main construction trade which was already implemented in 1997 as well as simulation results for a federal minimum wage.|$|R

This thesis looks theoretically at how labour-market programmes can be used within a matching-model context. Various model set ups are used and the overall result of this thesis is that programmes can crowd in or <b>crowd</b> out regular <b>employment,</b> depending on the structure of the labour market.

40|$|I build {{a dynamic}} {{stochastic}} {{general equilibrium model}} with search and matching frictions and two sectors in order to study the labour market effects of public sector employment and wages. Public sector wages {{plays an important role}} in achieving the efficient allocation. High wages induce too many unemployed to queue for public sector jobs, while if they are low, the government faces recruitment problems. The optimal steady-state wage premium depends mainly on the labour market friction parameters. In response to technology shocks, it is optimal to have procyclical public sector wages. Deviations from the optimal policy can increase the volatility of unemployment significantly. Public sector wage and employment shocks have mixed effects on unemployment. A wage shock raises the unemployment rate, while a reduction in the separations lowers it. Hiring more people can increase or decrease the unemployment rate. All shocks raise the wage and <b>crowd</b> out <b>employment</b> in the private sector. In the empirical part, I employ Bayesian methods to estimate the parameters of the model for the United States. I find that the direct search mechanism between the two sectors is an important element to explain business cycle fluctuations of the labour market variables. public sector employment, public sector wages, unemployment, fiscal shocks...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we attempt}} to renew the {{interest}} in marginal employment subsidies. Such subsidies are paid only for a firm's additional employment exceeding some reference level and create larger employment stimuli at lower fiscal costs than general wage subsidies for all workers. If the hiring of a new employee also entails subsidizing an incumbent worker (double marginal subsidization), the replacement of regular paid workers by outsourcing employment to newly established firms - a standard critique of marginal employment subsidies - can be avoided. This additional subsidy reduces the incentive to <b>crowd</b> out regular <b>employment</b> and results in even larger employment effects. Applying the subsidy scheme to the low-skill labor market in Germany, we show that employment can be substantially increased without imposing additional fiscal burden.

Theory suggests that public employment may not only <b>crowd</b> out private <b>employment,</b> but also increase overall unemployment if, by offering attractive working conditions, it draws additional individuals into the labour force. Empirical evidence from a sample of OECD countries in the 1960 – 2000 period suggests that, on average, creation of 100 public jobs may have eliminated about 150 private sector jobs, slightly decreased labour market participation, and increased by about 33 the number of unemployed workers. Theoretical considerations and empirical evidence, however, suggest that the crowding out effect of public jobs on private jobs is only significant in countries where public production is highly substitutable to private activities and the public sector offers more attractive wages and/or other benefits than the private labour market. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{displacement}} {{effect in the}} labor market captures the fact that employment generated by ALMP might displace or <b>crowd</b> our regular <b>employment,</b> which lowers the effectiveness of the instrument 24. For example, firms hire subsidized workers instead of hiring unsubsidized workers, or unsubsidized employed workers are fired and replaced by subsidized workers. In addition, the {{displacement effect}} also covers the fact that once the subsidy expires, the formerly subsidized worker is fired. Brown et al. (2011) illustrate that this effect can be reduced through effective targeting or tolerated if this enables long-term unemployed workers to reenter employment, regain work-routine and skills on the job, improving their longer-run employability. Often only additional jobs are subsidized, which reduces take-up rates, in order to significantly reduce displacement effects 25. Furthermore, Martin and Grubb (2001) argue that in the medium run, capital will adjust and, thereby, the displacement effect is only relevant in the short run.|$|R

40|$|In â€œNative Internal Migration and the Labor Market Impact of Immigration,â€ George Borjas (2006) {{identifies}} {{a strong}} {{negative correlation between}} immigration and native-born employment in the US using local area data. This relationship is particularly strong at the metropolitan area level, weaker but still significant at the state level, and weakest at the Census region level. In this note, we show that Borjas’s negative correlation arises due {{to the construction of}} the dependent and explanatory variables rather than from any true negative association between the employment growth of immigrants and natives. Borjas regresses log native employment, ln(Nt), on the share of foreign-born employment, pt = Mt/(Mt + Nt), across skill-state-year cells. The specification therefore includes native employment in the numerator of the dependent variable and in the denominator of the explanatory variable. This builds a negative correlation into the model that is particularly strong if the variance of Nt relative to Mt is large. To illustrate, we first show that state and city level regressions of the standardized native employment change, (Nt+ 10 âˆ’Nt) /(Mt+Nt), on standardized immigration, (Mt+ 10 âˆ’Mt) /(Mt+Nt), always find a positive and mostly significant correlation between the two. Second, we randomly simulate changes in the native and foreign-born workforce with a data generating process that has zero or positive correlation between the shocks Î”Mt and Î”Nt (i. e., so that immigration is associated with either no change or an increase in native employment). Borjas specifications employing this simulated data estimate large and significantly negative coefficients as long as the variance of Î”Nt is larger than the variance of Î”Mt, which is true in observed state-level and city-level data.

30|$|As {{concerns}} {{the possibility of}} changes in public wages impacting on the private sector, various channels may operate. First, large swings in public wages alter the supply of labour available to the labour market, inducing {{a change in the}} equilibrium wage if the labour market is perfectly competitive {{and in the absence of}} impediments to mobility. This is likely to be always true in the long-run with the two wages expected to be co-integrated with a slope coefficient of one. Second, rising public wages may <b>crowd</b> out private <b>employment,</b> increasing average productivity and thus wages in the private sector (Algan et al. 2002). Third, changes in public wages affect the outside option of unionized private sector workers, putting pressures on the bargaining process (Afonso and Gomes 2014), even when public and private employment remain separate. Fourth, changes in public wages that are compensated by an adjustment in labour taxation would mechanically alter private labour costs (Holmlund 1993; Forni and Giordano 2003). Indirectly, they may even alter wage demands if the wage bargaining system is such that wage setters have no incentive to internalise the consequences of their actions—i.e. where there is no centralization in wage bargaining (Alesina and Perotti 1997).|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} an {{appropriate}} government policy tool {{to promote the}} employment {{should be done with}} regard to the source of unemployment. This diploma the- sis investigates structural and cyclical components of unemployment. The two components are induced by different causes. Search and matching frictions in the labor market are the source of the structural component. The cyclical component is induced by a low labor productivity which induces a negative gross marginal profit of firms. Consequently, they are obliged to cancel a portion of existing job- worker matches. The main finding is that during a period of economic slowdown the overall unemployment and its cyclical component rise while the structural component declines. The dynamics of the two components is reversed during a robust economic growth.

40|$|Retirement system reforms such as postponing {{retirement}} age in law {{are needed in}} China because of its rapid population aging. The overquick aging will result in both shortage of labor force supply and incubus {{of the social security}} system. The Chinese government acknowledged the negative influences of population aging, but finally decided to maintain the {{retirement age}} in law unchanged. The reason, as claimed by the policy makers and many socio-economic scholars, is postponing retirement age in law in China will <b>crowd</b> out youth <b>employment.</b> Unfortunately, no empirical evidences are provided, although the claim is critical to the potential retirement system reform. In this paper, we firstly address the validity of this claim. Using micro data from China’s 1990 and 2000 census and the 2005 1 % population sample survey, we provide the first piece of evidence on the relationship between elderly employment and youth employment in China. Our OLS estimation results suggest that employment rates of younger persons are positively rather than negatively associated with employment rate of older persons. We further tried to identify a causal relationship by using two-way fixed effects and TSLS estimation strategies and found results consistent with our OLS estimation. Finally, we examine whether employment of older persons hurts the youth at the intensive margin by estimating the impact of elderly employment on younger workers’ monthly wage and still found a positive rather than negative effect. In short, the claim that postponing the retirement age will hurt the youth cannot be supported by empirical evidence. Although our empirical results are tentative, we view this paper as an important try to provide the first piece of evidence on the potential impact of retirement reform on youth employment and as suggesting further empirical studies on the claim that postponing retirement age will hurt the youth. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} model of the labor market that integrates two important sources of unemployment. The first source is a matching friction, which is a friction in matching unemployed workers to recruiting firms. The second source is job rationing, which is a possible shortage of jobs in the economy. To examine how these two sources interact over the business cycle, I decompose unemployment into a component caused by job rationing [...] -rationing unemployment [...] -and another component caused by matching frictions [...] -frictional unemployment. Formally, I define rationing unemployment as the level of unemployment that would prevail if matching frictions disappeared, and frictional unemployment as additional unemployment due to the matching frictions. The main theoretical result of this dissertation is that during recessions rationing unemployment increases, driving the rise in total unemployment, whereas frictional unemployment decreases. Intuitively, in bad times, there are too few jobs, the labor market is slack, recruiting is easy, and matching frictions contribute little to unemployment. I specify a model in which job rationing stems from a small amount of wage rigidity and diminishing marginal returns to labor. In the model calibrated with U. S. data, I find that when unemployment is below 5 %, it is only frictional; but when unemployment reaches 9 %, frictional unemployment amounts to less than 2 % of the labor force, and rationing unemployment to more than 7 %. I then show that in recessions, job rationing generates inefficiently high unemployment, which leaves room for labor market policies to improve social welfare. I evaluate three labor market policies—direct employment, placement services, and a wage subsidy—over the business cycle. First, I compute state-dependent fiscal multipliers (the increase in social welfare obtained by spending one dollar on a policy) to determine the effectiveness of these unemployment-reducing policies. I prove theoretically that placement services are more effective in good times than in bad times. The converse is true of direct employment. Intuitively, in bad times, frictional unemployment is low; placement services aim to further reduce this component and are therefore ineffective. The effectiveness of direct employment is a function of how much it <b>crowds</b> private <b>employment</b> out; in bad times, competition for workers is weak and crowding out is limited; thus, this policy is effective. In the calibrated model, wage subsidies are also more effective in bad times than in good times. To conclude, I characterize the optimal mix of policies implemented by a benevolent socialplanner. The optimal unemployment-reducing policy evolve over the business cycle: its puts more weight on policy instruments reducing matching frictions (placement services) in good times than in bad times; conversely, it puts more weight on policy instruments creating jobs directly (direct employment and a wage subsidy) in bad times than in good times. Intuitively, the optimal unemployment-reducing policy should adapt to the state of the labor market because of the cyclical fluctuations in the sources of unemployment...|$|R
60|$|To {{demonstrate}} this, we {{must turn}} to an elementary principle which was discussed {{in a former}} chapter.(290) General low wages do not cause low prices, nor high wages high prices, within the country itself. General prices are not raised by a rise of wages, {{any more than they}} would be raised by an increase of the quantity of labor required in all production. Expenses which affect all commodities equally have no influence on prices. If the maker of broadcloth or cutlery, and nobody else, had to pay higher wages, the price of his commodity would rise, just as it would if he had to employ more labor; because otherwise he would gain less profit than other producers, and nobody would engage in the employment. But if everybody has to pay higher wages, or everybody to employ more labor, the loss must be submitted to; as it affects everybody alike, no one can hope {{to get rid of it}} by a change of employment; each, therefore, resigns himself to a diminution of profits, and prices remain as they were. In like manner, general low wages, or a general increase in the productiveness of labor, does not make prices low, but profits high. If wages fall (meaning here by wages the cost of labor), why, on that account, should the producer lower his price? He will be forced, it may be said, by the competition of other capitalists who will <b>crowd</b> into his <b>employment.</b> But other capitalists are also paying lower wages, and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already. The rate, then, at which labor is paid, as well as the quantity of it which is employed, affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced, except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity, and not common to commodities generally.|$|R
