25|$|The first {{voyage of}} Centaurus {{departed}} from Astoria, Oregon in late December 1919, bound for Callao, Peru. During the voyage, {{one of the}} crewmen suffered a mental breakdown over concerns about his invalid passport. Instead of providing medical assistance, the sailor was placed in irons, removed from the <b>crew</b> <b>list</b> and relisted as a stowaway, then abandoned on the dockside when Centaurus departed Callao on 17 January 1920. The crewman ended up in an insane asylum, where he died later that year.|$|E
25|$|On March 28, Almeida {{appeared}} in court defended by Brigadier General William Henry Winder and Walter Dorsey, a court judge in Baltimore County. The defense argument was simple: the Congreso {{was not an}} American ship but of the United Provinces. Its owner (Aguirre) was {{a citizen of the}} United Provinces, as was Almeida, which was actually false, and that Baltimore was not a corsair base but rather only a safe harbor. While Judge James Houston in private not believe in the veracity of the arguments, and even joked about the changing the <b>crew</b> <b>list</b> to Anglo-Saxon names, dismissed the cause for insufficient evidence and ordered that his ship be returned to him.|$|E
25|$|His journal {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{detailed}} eyewitness accounts of the first weeks of European settlement of Australia. The journal entries for 18–26 January record first impressions on arrival including interactions with Aboriginal communities and descriptions of the vegetation, intense heat and native wildlife. The convicts and their children who disembarked the Lady Penrhyn at Port Jackson are listed. His first journal entry dated 22 March 1787 records the full <b>crew</b> <b>list</b> and the women convicts, their name, age, trade, crime and term of transportation. The list of children born on the voyage contains inaccuracies regarding the sex of the child and dates of birth and death. The Lady Penryhn, under charter to the East India Company to continue her voyage to China for a cargo of tea, departed Port Jackson in early May. His journal continues, recording the return voyage via Lord Howe Island, Tahiti, China, St Helena and finally England. The original journal is now in the collection of the National Library of Australia with manuscript copies in the British Library and State Library of New South Wales.|$|E

500|$|In 1924, the Daily Express {{published}} {{a story from}} a retired naval war hero, Captain R. Lucy, whose informant, allegedly, was Mary Celestes former bosun—no such person is recorded in the registered <b>crew</b> <b>list.</b> In this tale, Briggs and his crew are cast {{in the role of}} predators; they sight a derelict steamer, which they board and find deserted, with £3,500-worth of gold and silver in its safe. They decide to split the money, abandon Mary Celeste, and seek new lives in Spain, which they reach by using the steamer's lifeboats. Hastings finds it astonishing that such an unlikely story was, for a time, widely believed; readers, he says [...] "...were fooled by the magic of print." ...|$|E
2500|$|Probably {{inspired}} by his reading of Richard Henry Dana, Jr.'s new book Two Years Before the Mast, and by Jeremiah N. Reynolds's account in the May 1839 issue of The Knickerbocker magazine of the hunt for a great white sperm whale named Mocha Dick, Melville and Gansevoort traveled to New Bedford, where Melville {{signed up for a}} whaling voyage aboard a new ship, the Acushnet. Built in 1840, the ship measured some 104 feet in length, almost 28 feet in breadth, and almost 14 feet in depth. She measured slightly less than 360 tons, had two decks and three masts, but no galleries. Melville signed a contract on Christmas Day with the ship's agent as a [...] "green hand" [...] for 1/175th of whatever profits the voyage would yield. On Sunday the 27th the brothers heard the Reverend Enoch Mudge preach at the Seamen's Bethel on Johnny-Cake Hill, where white marble cenotaphs on the walls memorialized local sailors who had died at sea, often in battle with whales. When he signed the <b>crew</b> <b>list</b> the next day he was advanced $84.|$|E

50|$|The back-up <b>crew</b> <b>lists</b> became {{available}} to Western space analysts in 1988, and {{they noted that}} the back-up crew contained a woman, but did not contain another LII test pilot.

40|$|The Global Labour Market for Seafarers (GLMS) {{study has}} been {{conducted}} by the Seafarers International Research Centre (SIRC) for several years, and data collated from <b>crew</b> <b>lists</b> is available for the periods: 1993 - 2000; 2002; and 2003. Data from the study have previously been used to consider {{the profile of the}} seafaring workforce for the global cargo fleet in terms of characteristics such as age, nationality, ship type, and rank. The GLMS produces labour market estimates based upon <b>crew</b> <b>lists</b> collected from a sample of world ports. Its innovative methodology offers a valuable alternative to labour market estimates based on surveys of employers which suffer from low and potentially biased response rates as well as from a necessary reliance upon the subjective views of managers. Bias within the GLMS is more transparent, where it exists, and it relates almost entirely to port (sample) selection which can be assessed using comparisons with world fleet composition data...|$|R
