5|$|On {{arrival at}} Ohio State, Lavelli roomed with Les Horvath and Don McCafferty and {{played on the}} {{freshman}} team under coach Trevor Rees. Brown switched Lavelli to end (the position is now called wide receiver). His playing time with the football team was limited, however, due to injury. He became a first-string end as a sophomore in 1942, but was ailing from a <b>charley</b> <b>horse</b> in his thigh and sat out {{the first game of}} the season against a Fort Knox military team. He had recovered by the third game of the season and started in a game against Southern California. Lavelli was hit in the knee while grabbing for a pass near the end of the game, however, and broke a bone. He was sidelined for the rest of the season. The Buckeyes won the college football national championship that year.|$|E

During that game vs. Brandon, there was an online report that said that Milan Kostolny scored the winning goal, but in fact after video research, the goal was scored by Matthew Ball, off of Wade Redden's foot Detroit then started the final game vs Kamloops shorthanded, playing without Shayne McCosh (broken wrist) and Bryan Berard, trying to play with a bad <b>charley</b> <b>horse.</b> The Blazers blew the game open in the second period and went on to win 8-2.|$|E

5000|$|The Dali Llama's seventh CD, Full on Dunes {{presented}} heavier, thicker, {{and faster}} songs. It blended the band's desert punk and heavy rock roots. Jeff Howe, drummer, joined the band. Some of the Huskey's high school friends performed as guests on the CD. They included Mario Lalli (Fatso Jetson, Yawning Man and Desert Sessions), Sean Wheeler (Throw Rag, Sun Trash and <b>Charley</b> <b>Horse),</b> Joe Dillon (from Hot Beat Pussy Fiend) and Scott Reeder.

60|$|Mr Grant {{said this}} {{with an air}} of vexation, that annoyed his friend a little. He would not have much minded <b>Charley's</b> taking a <b>horse</b> without leave, no matter how wild it might be; but he did not at all relish the idea of making an apology for his son's misconduct, and for the moment did not exactly know what to say. As usual in such a dilemma, the old man took refuge in a towering passion, gave his steed a sharp cut with the whip, and galloped forward to meet the delinquent.|$|R
50|$|For much of {{his young}} {{childhood}} his father was an officer fighting for the Confederacy in the Civil War, and moved his family to Georgia and New Orleans. After the war, the senior Colcord sold {{his interest in the}} family farm to his brother and used the proceeds to purchase a sugar plantation north of New Orleans. When son Charley, then about ten, contracted malaria from a nearby swamp, his father sent him to the ranch owned by his friend Charles Sanders near Banquete, Texas so that he could recover. When W. R. Colcord opened a ranch near Corpus Christi, Texas to raise <b>horses,</b> <b>Charley</b> ran away to work as a cowboy. In 1875, he was sent on a cattle drive to Baxter Springs followed by a buffalo hunt on the western prairies. There he learned of the need for horses in central Kansas, which he reported back to his father.|$|R
5000|$|McCormick {{was raised}} in the {{southern}} Oregon town of Myrtle Creek. While working at ABC-TV in Los Angeles, McCormick pitched a children's program to a CBS affiliate in Fresno, California, and went on the air there in Spring, 1959 with Charley (inspired by Dennis Weaver's character Chester on Gunsmoke) and his sidekick Humphrey. <b>Charley</b> was a <b>horse</b> who wore a sea captain's hat, and Humphrey Hambone was a bulldog. In time, he'd added additional characters, [...] "Sneezer," [...] "Shagnasty Bear," [...] and [...] "Pussyfoot", the grand piano playing cat wearing sunglasses. The characters followed McCormick when he signed with San Francisco's KGO-TV in 1961, and finally to KTVU where they starred in [...] "The Charley and Humphrey Show" [...] from 1972-1976 and they became a staple in afternoon PSAs. Humphrey eventually wore a trademark Oakland Raiders sweater sent to McCormick by Sonny Barger of the Oakland Hells Angels.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Charley</b> <b>horse</b> (or charlie horse) is {{a popular}} colloquial term in Canada and the United States for painful {{involuntary}} spasms or cramps in the leg muscles, typically lasting anywhere from {{a few seconds to}} about a day. It is less likely to refer to a bruise on an arm or leg and a bruising of the quadriceps muscle of the anterior or lateral thigh, or contusion of the femur, that commonly results in a haematoma and sometimes several weeks of pain and disability. In this latter sense, such an injury is known as dead leg. [...] In Australia it is also known as a corked thigh or corky. It often occurs in contact sports, such as football when an athlete suffers a knee (blunt trauma) to the lateral quadriceps causing a haematoma or temporary paresis and antalgic gait as a result of pain.|$|E
5000|$|Ivan Ooze was {{a tyrant}} 6,000 years ago, {{until he was}} imprisoned in an egg-shaped Hyperlock Chamber by Zordon and {{a small group of}} young warriors, who presumably were the {{precursors}} to the modern Power Rangers. When his hyperlock chamber is unearthed by an Angel Grove construction crew, Ivan was released by Lord Zedd after 6,000 years of imprisonment. Apparently, he was most angered by the boredom of his lengthy imprisonment, being forced to miss several disasters throughout Earth's history such as the Black Death, the Spanish Inquisition, and the 1981 reunion of The Brady Bunch. He also claims that he [...] "had a <b>Charley</b> <b>horse</b> since the Renaissance." [...] Ivan proceeds to demolish the Command Center and fatally injure Zordon and Alpha 5, leaving the Rangers powerless to morph, fight or even call their Zords.|$|E
60|$|The {{doctor and}} the country air {{effected}} a prodigious cure upon Miss Lambert. Hetty always attended as duenna, and sometimes of his holiday, Master <b>Charley</b> rode my <b>horse</b> when I got into the carriage. What a deal of love-making Miss Hetty heard!--with what exemplary patience she listened to it! I do not say she went to hear the Methodist sermons any more, but 'tis certain that {{when we had a}} closed carriage she would very kindly and considerately look out of the window. Then, what heaps of letters there were!--what running to and fro! Gumbo's bandy legs were for ever on the trot from my quarters to Dean Street; and, on my account or her own, Mrs. Molly, the girl's maid, was for ever bringing back answers to Bloomsbury. By the time when the autumn leaves began to turn pale, Miss Theo's roses were in full bloom again, and my good Doctor Heberden's cure was pronounced to be complete. What else happened during this blessed period? Mr. Warrington completed his great tragedy of Pocahontas, which was not only accepted by Mr. Garrick this time (his friend Dr. Johnson having spoken not unfavourably of the work), but my friend and cousin, Hagan, was engaged by the manager to perform the part of the hero, Captain Smith. Hagan's engagement was not made before it was wanted. I had helped him and his family with means disproportioned, perhaps, to my power, especially considering my feud with Madam Esmond, whose answer to my angry missive of April came to me towards autumn, and who wrote back from Virginia with war for war, controlment for controlment. These menaces, however, frightened me little: my poor mother's thunder could not reach me; and my conscience, or casuistry, supplied me with other interpretations for her texts of Scripture, so that her oracles had not the least weight with me in frightening me from my purpose. How my new loves speeded I neither informed her, nor any other members of my maternal or paternal family, who, on both sides, had been bitter against my marriage. Of what use wrangling with them? It was better to carpere diem and its sweet loves and pleasures, and to leave the railers to grumble, or the seniors to advise, at their ease.|$|R
5000|$|Quest {{has been}} {{credited}} in several accounts with coining the phrase [...] "Charley horse" [...] {{to describe a}} sudden leg cramp or sprain. In The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, baseball historian Bill James relies on an origin story set forth in multiple accounts published in 1906, and attributed to former outfielder Hugh Nichol. According to that version, Quest and several {{other members of the}} White Stockings spent an off day at a horse race {{on the south side of}} Chicago. The players had received a tip that a horse named [...] "Charley" [...] was a [...] "sure thing" [...] in one of the races. All of the players, except Quest, placed bets on Charley. The horse took an early lead in the race but pulled up lame around the final turn. Quest, who had been teased for not betting on the horse, reportedly yelled to the other players, [...] "Look at your <b>Charley</b> <b>horse</b> now." [...] The next day, while running to second base, Chicago outfielder George Gore pulled up with a strain, much as the horse had done. The incident is reported to have prompted Quest to proclaim, [...] "There's your old Charley horse." [...] From that time, the players began using the term to refer to a sudden leg cramp or strain.|$|E
40|$|Background:About one {{in every}} three adults are {{affected}} by lower limb muscle cramps. For some people, these cramps reduce quality of life, quality of sleep and participation in activities of daily living. Many interventions are available for lower limb cramps, but some are controversial, no treatment guidelines exist, and often people experience no benefit from the interventions prescribed. Objectives: To assess the effects of non-drug, non-invasive treatments for lower limb cramp. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (13 September 2011) using the terms: cramp, spasm, contracture, <b>charley</b> <b>horse</b> and lower limb, lower extremity, foot, calf, leg, thigh, gastrocnemius, hamstring, quadriceps. We also searched CENTRAL (2011, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2011) and EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2011) and the reference lists of included studies. There were no language or publication restrictions. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials of non-drug, non-invasive interventions trialled over at least four weeks {{for the prevention of}} lower limb muscle cramps in any group of people. We excluded, for example, surgery, acupuncture and dry-needling, as invasive interventions. We selected only trials that included {{at least one of the}} following outcomes: cramp frequency, cramp severity, health-related quality of life, quality of sleep, participation in activities of daily living and adverse outcomes. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and cross checked data extraction and analysis. A third author was to arbitrate in the event of disagreement. We asked the authors of five trials for information to assist with screening studies for eligibility and received four responses. Main results: One trial was eligible for inclusion. All participants were age 60 years or over and had received a repeat prescription from their general practitioner of quinine for nighttime cramps in the preceding three months. This review includes data from only those participants who were advised to continue taking quinine. Forty-nine participants were advised to complete lean-to-wall calf muscle stretching held for 10 s three times per day. Forty-eight participants were allocated to a placebo stretching group. After 12 weeks, there was no statistically significant difference in recalled cramp frequency between groups. No “significant” adverse effect was reported. Limitations in the study’s design impede interpretation of the results and clinical applicability. Authors’ conclusions: There is limited evidence on which to base clinical decisions regarding the use of non-drug therapies for the treatment of lower limb muscle cramp. Serious methodological limitations in the existing evidence hinder clinical application. There is an urgent need to carefully evaluate many of the commonly recommended and emerging non-drug therapies in well designed randomised controlled trials...|$|E
