50|$|There {{are three}} major disease of collards: Alternaria, downy mildew, and black rot. Alternaria {{symptoms}} are small brown lesions {{on the surface}} of the collard leaf. Downy mildew produces small yellow fungal spots on the leaf that cause the plant to wither and die. Finally, black rot gets its name because its primary symptom is the fungus will infect the veins of the plant and turn them black. These black veins eventually collapse and the plant dies.

50|$|Fire blight {{was first}} {{described}} in New York {{in the late}} 18th century, and moved west with settlers, becoming established throughout North American apple production areas by the early 20th century. While fire blight {{has always been a}} concern in eastern apple production, severe outbreaks in the west in recent years have caused growers there to adopt more consistent and vigorous monitoring and management programs as well. The disease can affect every part of the tree, from the fruit to the trunk. Infected trees may die within months or can linger for years with severely reduced yields. In addition to the scorched appearance of the plant parts that gives the disease its name, plant tissues infected with the bacteria will exude milky or reddish-brown ooze. Initially <b>copper</b> <b>sprays</b> were used for fire blight control in the 1930s but this method had limited success. In the 1950s streptomycin and oxytetracycline showed high success in controlling fire blight in comparison to copper. Since then streptomycin sprayed two to three times during blooming phase has become the treatment of choice.|$|E
40|$|Bacterial canker is {{a serious}} disease of sweet cherry that limits orchard life and tree productivity.  New York tree fruit growers ranked the need for {{research}} on bacterial canker in the top ten. Currently, <b>copper</b> <b>sprays</b> are used to manage the disease, however, the effectiveness of <b>copper</b> <b>sprays</b> in protecting pruning cuts is unknown. Leaving a 15 -cm-long pruning stub to manage the lethal canker phase of the disease has shown promise. The occurrence of copper-resistant bacteria and negative impacts of copper on soils underscore the need for research. We studied the effectiveness of spring <b>copper</b> <b>sprays</b> and the pruning stub in preventing canker infection. Neither copper nor pruning stubs prevented infection of inoculated and uninoculated pruning cuts. Six training systems were assessed and ranked in order of increasing bacterial canker incidence as follows: Perpendicular V, Zahn Vertical Axis, Marchant, Vogel Slender Spindle, Modified Central Leader, and Spanish Bush.

40|$|Four field {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} 2004 to analyse the efficacy of reduced rates of copper fungicides against Phytophthora infestans (3 x organic and 1 x conventional growing). Copper (Cu-hydroxide, Cu-oxychloride or Cu-octanoate) was sprayed in a weekly routine or according to the decision support system SIMPHYT with total dosages ranging from 0. 57 kg/ha to 4. 0 kg/ha. The results revealed in almost all treatments a significant reduction of late blight, except for the lowest rates (e. g. 4 x 0. 14 kg/ha Cu as Cu-octanoate or 6 x 0. 15 kg/ha Cu as Cu-hydroxide). There was a clear dose-response relation between increasing rates of copper and control of late blight in each experiment. Marketable yields varied from 132 dt/ha to 238 dt/ha in organic field trials depending on trial site and copper treatment. Generally, an effect of copper treatment and late blight on yield could be shown. Even a slight reduction of P. infestans increased yield by 10 % to 20 %.

40|$|International audienceSurface {{preparation}} of substrates is a major stage in thermal spraying as it greatly influences coating adhesion. Standard grit-blasting creates roughness but also often leaves grit inclusions at the substrate surface, which are detrimental for coating quality. In contrast, the use of smooth substrates involves improvements in metallurgical adhesion. This work deals {{with the use of}} substrate pre-heating and of the PROTAL® process (lsquoPROjection Thermique Assistée par Laserrsquo) to promote metallurgical adhesion. PROTAL is based on substrate laser treatment prior to spraying to achieve an oxide-free interface and, under specific conditions, which modifies the substrate morphology. A metallurgically reactive system (i. e., <b>copper</b> <b>sprayed</b> onto Al 2017) was selected to be suitable for controlling metallurgical features at the coating-substrate interface (mainly pores, intermetallic phases and pre-existing cracks). These were shown to depend on substrate roughness and on the substrate temperature during the first spraying pass. LAser shock adhesion test, namely LASAT, was developed to enable morphological and metallurgical features of as-sprayed interfaces to be studied separately. The existence of a critical roughness for anchoring (CRA) and of an adhesion transition temperature (ATT) could be assumed. As for metallurgical properties, interface intermetallics and pre-existing cracks were shown to be detrimental for adhesion. Moreover, LASATesting succeeded in showing that adhesion of PROTAL coatings is better than that of APS-only coatings...|$|R

Unfortunately it is increasingly devastated by canker disease. Several measures are often recommended for citrus canker management worldwide; the major ones being orchard inspection, quarantines, protective <b>copper</b> <b>sprays</b> and the on-site burning of infected trees. The adoption rate for these options in Northern Uganda has not been possible and as a result, the disease has reached epiphytotic level.

Examples of produced shielding screens from perforated steel tape for protection from electromagnetic fields in different frequency range are offered and tested. The efficiency of a shielding material was determined by measuring the magnetic field before and after applying the shielding material. Distribution of the magnetic field behind the shielding screen was determined by software vector mapping.

The patch and ground plane of the proposed sensor are fabricated by conductive <b>copper</b> <b>spray</b> coating on the masks made by 3 D printer. The fabricated patch and the ground plane are bonded to a commercial silicon substrate and then attached to 5 mm-high chamber made by 3 D printer so that it contains only 1 mL seawater.

The designed sensor has a resonance frequency separation of 37. 9 kHz and reflection coefficients under − 20 dB at the resonant frequencies. The fabricated sensor showed better performance with average frequency separation of 48 kHz and maximum reflection coefficient of − 35 dB.
