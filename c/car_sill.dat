5000|$|The [...] "Blue Train" [...] is a Limited Edition {{version of}} the Bentley Mulsanne Speed created to {{celebrate}} the 1930 Bentley Speed Six coupe that famously outran the so-called “Blue Train” Calais-Mediterranée Express from Cannes to Calais, {{going so far as}} to return to London four minutes before the train reached the English Channel. A total of four Bentley Mulsanne Speed [...] "Blue Train" [...] models will be built, in celebration of the four-minute victory. Two of the cars were rendered in Beluga (solid black) and the other two cars were open to custom paint schemes. Other features specific to this model include 21-inch black wheels with polished centers, a chrome grille surround with a black square-mesh insert evocative of the original Blue Train, a Bentley Driver’s Club badge fixed to the grille, a retractable Flying 'B' engraved with the words “Blue Train 85 Years”, Burnt Oak and Camel leather, door stitch patterns that mimic the original <b>car,</b> <b>sill</b> plates and headrests showcasing the original car’s silhouette, and a rendering of the original car in the burr walnut passenger-side wood veneer. The first production unit featured a unique picnic set, trimmed with the same two-tone leathers as the interior of the car, containing Robbe & Berking silver cutlery, Haviland Limoges porcelain, Linley crystal champagne flutes, and an Angora picnic rug. The Mulliner team handcrafted the leather cutlery holders as well as the leather rug holder which featured [...] "Blue Train" [...] embroidery. The picnic set was offered as an option for the other three cars.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to define the crash characteristics of near-side impact crashes in which children seated in the rear rows are injured. The crash characteristics included the direction of force, heading angle, horizontal impact location, vertical impact location, extent of deformation and intrusion at the child occupant's seating position. Cases from in-depth crash investigation databases of the NASS-CDS (National Automotive Sampling System-Crashworthiness Data System), CIREN (Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network) and Chalmers University of Technology were reviewed. The principal direction of force was most frequently between 60 ° and 75 °. The heading angle of the bullet vehicle was most commonly between 61 ° and 90 °. The bullet vehicle hit the passenger compartment of the target vehicle, particularly the rear door. Often, one or both of the adjacent pillars to the rear door were involved, most commonly the B pillar. In 11 of 16 crashes, the <b>car</b> <b>sill</b> was not engaged. Most commonly, the deformation extent was into Zone 3 or more – about 40 cm – and the intrusion at the child's seating position was in the range 20 – 30 cm. This review of the crashes revealed differences between the current side impact test procedures and the actual side impact crashes in which children were injured...|$|E

5000|$|The logs {{were painted}} {{white and the}} ends painted green. This was the first {{drive-in}} in Canada. The car-hops wore green uniforms with Naugahyde captain's caps, and a white stripe down the pant leg. Nat's specially designed tray fit between the <b>car's</b> window <b>sills.</b> He became famous for his hamburgers, which used Nat's [...] "secret sauce", which was rumoured to be Thousand Island dressing mixed with mayonnaise, but he never revealed the recipe.|$|R
50|$|During {{construction}} of the first <b>car</b> fiber-glass <b>sills,</b> doors, and windscreen surround were decided upon to reduce the workload. Tron Cars on Auckland's North Shore were given the task of mould making due to their quality work on a Lamborghini Countach replica and an RX7 based car called the Mountach. Two more vehicles were sold during this period and delivered in 1989 as rolling chassis. Also four chassis were made for the Company Directors to test and improve the assembly manual.|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of August 14, 1990, Mello was {{observed}} with Gordon O'Brien, William Anthony, a recently paroled freelance hitman from West Warwick, as they sat in a parked car in on the East Side of Providence,Rhode Island. Although initially holding back on the assumption the three men may have been detectives, patrolman Frank Moody approached the car to investigate when Mello was seen taking a blackjack and throwing it onto the <b>car's</b> rear window <b>sill.</b>|$|R
