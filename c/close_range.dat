5|$|Barlow {{immediately}} {{turned to}} investigate the strange sail, steering southwards directly at the lumbering vessel. Saulnier was seemingly unwilling to attempt any manoeuvere {{in the face of}} the enemy, as Africaine continued to hold the original course without deviation. By 19:30 it was inevitable that Phoebe would intercept Africaine and Saulnier shortened sail, slowing his frigate to meet the threat. Barlow was still unsure of the identity of the stranger and fired a shot over Africaine as a warning to its captain to identify his ship. Saulnier responded by turning to port and firing a broadside directly at Phoebe. It was poorly aimed however and mostly scattered into the sea without effect. At this, Barlow pulled Phoebe into a parallel position to Africaine and unleashed a much more devastating broadside from <b>close</b> <b>range.</b> The two frigates then began an exchange of fire at <b>close</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the withdraw, however, A Company {{ran into}} a sizable North Korean force and had {{scattered}} in the ensuing fight. Most of the company, including its commander were killed at <b>close</b> <b>range.</b> In this desperate action, Private First Class Luther H. Story, a weapons squad leader, fought so tenaciously that {{he was awarded the}} Medal of Honor. Badly wounded, Story refused to be a burden to those who might escape, and when last seen was still engaging North Korean at <b>close</b> <b>range.</b> Of those in the company, approximately ten men escaped to friendly lines. The next morning, under heavy fog, the group made its way by compass toward Yongsan. From a hill at 12:00, after the fog had lifted, the men looked down on the Battle of Yongsan which was then in progress. That afternoon 20 survivors of the company merged into the lines of the 72nd Tank Battalion near Yongsan. Stragglers from this position continued to stream {{in the next few days}} as well.|$|E

5|$|Monitor, to the {{surprise}} of Virginias crew, had emerged from behind Minnesota and went straight for the approaching Virginia and positioned herself between her and the grounded Minnesota, preventing the Confederate ironclad from further engaging the vulnerable wooden ship at <b>close</b> <b>range.</b> At 8:45am Worden gave the order to fire where Greene fired the first shots of the battle between the two ironclads which harmlessly deflected off the Confederate ironclad. During the battle Monitor fired solid shot, about once every eight minutes, while Virginia fired shell exclusively. The ironclads generally fought at <b>close</b> <b>range</b> for about four hours, ending at 12:15pm, ranging from a few yards to more than a hundred. Both ships were constantly in motion, maintaining a circular pattern. Because of Virginias weak engines, massive size and weight and with a draft of , she was slow and difficult to maneuver, taking her half an hour to complete a 180-degree turn.|$|E

5|$|By 21:15, Pinsum {{realised}} {{that his}} heavily laden ship could not outrun Amethyst and reduced his speed, turning sharply {{in front of}} the British ship in an attempt to rake her. Seymour was prepared for the manoeuvre and countered it by turning sharply away from Thétis so that the French broadside fell harmlessly into the sea and both frigates performed a complete circle before returning to their previous course. Seymour then swung back towards the French ship, bringing Amethyst alongside and pouring a heavy fire into Thétis, which replied in kind. For 25 minutes, the frigates continued firing on one another from <b>close</b> <b>range</b> as they sailed westwards. At 21:40, Pinsum again attempted to rake Amethyst, trying to cross the British ship's stern as she pulled ahead. Seymour countered by slowing his ship and the French rigging became tangled in the British, the firing continuing as the crews worked to free their ships from one another. Separating a few minutes later, the frigates continued their close-range duel. Amethyst again pulled ahead at 22:05, Seymour successfully crossing the bow of the French ship from port and raking her before swinging back along the starboard side to resume the <b>close</b> <b>range</b> exchange of broadsides.|$|E
