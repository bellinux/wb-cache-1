25|$|The <b>closing</b> <b>price</b> is {{reported}} as the median of five price snapshots taken from 3:59 to 4:00pm every 15 seconds. In May 2008, the exchange also implemented a closing auction session {{to run from}} 4:00pm to 4:10pm, with a similar pricing mechanism as the opening auction; however, this resulted in significant fluctuations in the closing prices of stocks and suspicions of market manipulation. Initially, the exchange proposed limiting price fluctuations in the auction sessions to 2%; in the end, they removed the closing session entirely in March 2009.|$|E
25|$|ETFs are {{dependent}} on {{the efficacy of the}} arbitrage mechanism in order for their share price to track net asset value. While the average deviation between the daily <b>closing</b> <b>price</b> and the daily NAV of ETFs that track domestic indices is generally less than 2%, the deviations may be more significant for ETFs that track certain foreign indices. The Wall Street Journal reported in November 2008, during a period of market turbulence, that some lightly traded ETFs frequently had deviations of 5% or more, exceeding 10% in a handful of cases, although even for these niche ETFs, the average deviation was only a little more than 1%. The trades with the greatest deviations tended to be made immediately after the market opened.|$|E
25|$|Nasser's {{response}} was the nationalization of the Suez Canal. On 26 July, {{in a speech}} in Alexandria, Nasser gave a riposte to Dulles. During his speech he deliberately pronounced the name of Ferdinand de Lesseps, the builder of the canal, a code-word for Egyptian forces to seize control of the canal and implement its nationalization. He announced that the Nationalization Law had been published, that all assets of the Suez Canal Company had been frozen, and that stockholders would be paid the price of their shares according to the day's <b>closing</b> <b>price</b> on the Paris Stock Exchange. That same day, Egypt closed the canal to Israeli shipping. Egypt also closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping, and blockaded the Gulf of Aqaba, in contravention of the Constantinople Convention of 1888. Many argued that this was also a violation of the 1949 Armistice Agreements.|$|E

25|$|In January 2014, it was {{announced}} that Jim Beam would be purchased by Suntory Holdings Ltd., a Japanese group of brewers & distillers known for producing Japan's first whiskey. Suntory agreed to acquire Jim Beam, Maker's Mark, Teacher's Highland Cream and Laphroaig distillery Scotch whiskies for approximately $13.62 billion and also take on Beam's debt. This deal is the biggest Suntory has ever agreed to and will elevate them to the third largest maker of distilled drinks in the world. The combined company is expected to have annual sales of spirits products of more than $4.3 billion. Suntory will pay $83.50 per share, a 25 percent premium to Beam's Friday <b>closing</b> <b>price</b> of $66.97. The companies put the deal's value at about $16 billion, including debt. According to press releases regarding the deal, the Illinois-based Jim Beam will continue to be managed by its current leadership. Beam and Suntory unanimously approved the transaction; however, the deal needs to be approved by Beam Inc. stockholders. Pending approval by its shareholders, the deal was expected to close by June 30, 2014. Jim Beam and Suntory have a previous partnership where they would freely distribute each other's brands in different markets.|$|E

2500|$|Following the Black Monday {{market crash}} in 1987, NYSE imposed trading curbs to reduce market {{volatility}} and massive panic sell-offs.

Level 1 and Level 2 declines result in a 15-minute trading halt unless they occur after 3:25pm, when no trading halts apply.

2500|$|Even {{before the}} crash of Flight 17, many analysts and the media {{suggested}} that Malaysia Airlines would need to rebrand and repair its image and/or require government assistance to return to profitability. On 8 August, trading in the company's stock was temporarily suspended when Khazanah Nasional—the majority shareholder (69.37%) and a Malaysian state-run investment arm—requested that MAS' Board of Directors undertake a selective capital reduction exercise (e.g. buyback or cancel stock of other shareholders); Khazanah announced it will spend 1.38billion ringgit (US$431million; 27 sen per share) to compensate minority shareholders (a 12.5% premium of 7 August <b>closing</b> <b>price).</b> At the time, Khazanah Nasional did not announce much about its plans for the airline except that the airline had [...] "substantial funding requirements" [...] and that a [...] "comprehensive review and restructuring" [...] was needed.|$|E

5000|$|Late {{trading was}} not a new phenomenon.
