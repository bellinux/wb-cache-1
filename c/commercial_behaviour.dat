A novel methodology was developed to collect information from local firms using a combination phone and web-survey. Establishment-level data about business characteristics and commercial vehicle activities in the study area was collected from 171 establishments for analysis. Ordered logit models were used to determine the factors affecting the number of inbound and outbound commercial vehicle trips. The modeling results show that establishment characteristics are more effective in representing outbound movements than inbound. The model results are useful in explaining some of the factors giving rise to commercial trip generation, as well as revealing areas where further research is required, for a more complete understanding of <b>commercial</b> <b>behaviours...</b>|$|R

This paper aims to investigate the overall epidemic trend and associated high-risk behaviours among Chinese MSM and to explore the governmental and community responses to the epidemic. Recent Findings. HIV prevalence among Chinese MSM increased rapidly in all Chinese regions in the past decade and disproportionally affected the Southwest China. In addition to the high-risk homosexual <b>behaviours,</b> overlapping bisexual, <b>commercial,</b> and drug use behaviours are commonly observed among Chinese MSM. The Chinese government has significantly expanded the surveillance efforts among MSM over the past decade. Community responses against HIV have been substantially strengthened with the support of international aid. However, lack of enabling legal and financial environment undermines the role of community-based organisations (CBOs) in HIV surveillance and prevention. Conclusion. HIV continues to spread rapidly among MSM in China. The hidden nature of MSM and the overlapping homosexual, bisexual, and <b>commercial</b> <b>behaviours</b> remain a challenge for HIV prevention among MSM. Strong collaboration between the government and CBOs and innovative intervention approaches are essential for effective HIV surveillance and prevention among MSM in China...|$|R

Throughout the discussion, the study of unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>behaviours</b> in off-plan sales proceeds with the thinking on the design of a better regulatory regime, which involves yet goes beyond the analysis of individual rules of the Consent Scheme and the Residential Properties (First-hand Sales) Ordinance. The thesis first examines information and description of a variety of aspects pertaining to the property, the agreement and the sale: floor area; internal and external dimensions; fittings, finishes and appliances; location and environmental features; floor number; date of completion; lease term; salient points of the Deed of Mutual Covenants and Land Grant Conditions; sales arrangement; and transaction record. This is followed by a discussion on the design of the sales brochure, show flats, advertisements, project website, and preliminary agreement for sale and purchase. Then the thesis explores the bigger picture of the construction of a regulatory regime that strikes a balance between economic freedom and consumer protection, where different approaches to regulate property misdescripton including the doctrine of misrepresentation at common law and the Property Misdescriptions Act 1991 are compared. published_or_final_versionLawDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|My thesis explores how {{new social}} {{relationships}} can be reinforced by architectural spaces in residential projects in today’s complex, cross-cultural, political, and economic urban conditions. In Toronto, some newer types of construction often lack the same potential {{for people to}} connect and feel accepted within a community. Especially in newly constructed condo projects and suburban houses, Toronto is losing much of its social heritage. Corresponding with the City of Toronto’s appeal for better community housing, this proposal presents {{a new type of}} lifestyle, hybrid and vital living in a social-dynamic community. My hypothesis is that the degree of social cohesiveness in a residential project is impacted by its spatial forms. In this regard, the research is conducted on both spatial and social aspects so that a conclusion can be drawn from a cross-projects analysis. Hutong life in Beijing, presented as an ideal urban living precedent has a similar social bond. Based on the spatial form in Hutong, space regulation becomes the original strategy in the proposal. John Holland proposed a methodology of constrained generating procedures. Two models comprise this modeling system: the static model stands for physical forms, such as maps and architecture; the dynamic model discovers the “rules of the game” that allow systems to change their forms. By importing the concept cohort as the basic living cluster, the spatial hierarchy has been set up as the static model, which becomes the bottom-up architectural form for generating a community. The dynamic model that represents the emergence of bottom-up social interaction is approached by setting up the rules, which include social programs, such as social activities for different scenarios, autonomous clans, or <b>commercial</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Spontaneously, the new social network within this community forms. This generating process abstracts residences from cities as an independent self-organizing system that implies in a residential community...|$|R

The basic ideas are grounded on the extension of the Fibich–Gibori distribution (Fibich and Gibori, 2010) obtained for a minimally connected one dimensional, 1 D, network topology and a subsequent inclusion, in a convex combination, with the Bemmaor–Lee distribution (Bemmaor and Lee, 2002), which takes into account unobserved heterogeneity aspects of agents in a market under a complete connectivity.

40|$|New Zealand {{attracted}} much {{international attention}} in the late 1980 s and 1990 s for its radical economic and social reforms. This reforming tendency {{shows no signs of}} abating. In late 1999 the national (conservative) government was replaced by a Labour led coalition, which is rapidly and significantly changing the way publicly financed health services are organised. Before the general election, Labour had criticised the national government's quasimarket system for its narrow focus on the production of services rather than the improvement of health, for having fragmented a public service, for fostering inappropriate <b>commercial</b> <b>behaviour,</b> for increasing transaction costs, and for lacking local democratic input. These problems were attributed to the "corporate model" of public hospital provision and a single, national purchasing agency. Both will now be replaced with a system promoted as allowing greater community "voice" in health sector decision making and "putting the public back into the public health system. " This paper reviews New Zealand's experience with the quasimarket model and appraises the rationale for another round of structural change. We identify challenges policymakers face in achieving their goals, consider the general lessons provided by New Zealand's frequent U-turns in policy, and offer a set of criteria against which the new system might be assessed...|$|E
40|$|This paper sorts out {{the most}} {{important}} factors influencing crop market participation of smallholder farmers in the highlands of Eastern Ethiopia. The study used primary data collected from 385 smallholder farmers during the year 2015. Heckman two-stage and Tobit models were employed for the analyses. Heckman model of first-stage results indicated that households’ decision to participate in crop output markets were influenced by factors such as sex of household head, farming experience, livestock holding, cultivated land size, off/non-farm income, fertilizer used, on-farm income, market distance, and crop diversification. Moreover, the second-stage results revealed that farm households’ intensity of crop output market participation was influenced by different factors such as dependency ratio, cultivated land size, education status, chemical fertilizer, and distance to market. The Tobit model result also indicated that the extent of farm household’s participation in annual crop fertilizer market as buyer is influenced by the amount of cultivated land, land allocated to khat crop, off/ non-farm income (log), amount of manure used and distance to the main road. From policy perspective, we recommend that strategies aimed at improving <b>commercial</b> <b>behaviour</b> of smallholder farmers in the study area should be directed in addressing the determining factors of both crop input and output market participation...|$|E

A graphical representation helps the user to find out a strategy to optimize classification by adding, moving or delete a neuron in order to change the number of classes. The tool is able to automatically suggest a strategy to optimize the number of classes optimization, but also support both tree classifications and semi-lattice organizations of the classes to give to the users the possibility of passing from one class to the ones with which it has some aspects in common. Examples of using tree and semi-lattice classifications are given to illustrate advantages and problems.
