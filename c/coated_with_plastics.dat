40|$|Purpose: Literature {{consists}} a lot {{of information}} concerning the issues of the fatigue endurance of metals <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> <b>plastics.</b> However few studies explicitly explain, what mechanisms decide on the increased fatigue endurance of metals <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> <b>plastics.</b> Therefore an expression is a purpose of the work on what a way increasing this fatigue endurance permanence is taking a place. Design/methodology/approach: In hereby article they discussed issues concerning the fatigue endurance of metals coated with plastic. Authors are putting the thesis on the basis of an analysis of literature and own examinations, that metals coated with material are characterized by an increased fatigue endurance. Findings: On the basis of results conclusions concerning raising the fatigue endurance permanence of some coated metals were deduced from an experiment with material. Research limitations/implications: Examinations were concentrated only on determining the influence of the electrode potential and power of adhesion on metal samples (steel 20 and 45) covered with different coatings. To the purpose of demonstrating the increased fatigue endurance permanence of analyzed samples they limited themselves to experiments taking into consideration the strength to turning and bending. Practical implications: Get results of research are broadening their knowledge of the scope of changes of the fatigue strength of metals coated with plastic. Originality/value: Authors are making a demand that the considerable increase of the fatigue endurance permanence of tested samples is caused with influence of electric double layer by adhesive force of the coating to metal...|$|E

40|$|Miniature Thermochron iButton dataloggers have {{transformed}} {{the ways in}} which researchers collect thermal data. However, one important limitation is that these dataloggers are not waterproof, which can lead to device failure and loss of data under field conditions. Several methods have been used to increase their water resistance, but no study to date has investigated whether any of these techniques affects the accuracy of temperature readings. Waterproofing potentially could affect the accuracy of iButtons by biasing temperatures or altering rates of warming and cooling. We compared temperature profiles of unmodified Thermochron iButtons (model DS 1921 G) to iButtons that we <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> a clear <b>plastic</b> dip (designed to coat tool handles) to determine whether this waterproof coating affects the accuracy of temperatures they record. We also compared temperatures recorded by uncoated and coated iButtons that were embedded within physical models that mimic frog body temperatures. Finally, we used our field data to test whether <b>coating</b> iButtons <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> prevents failure of dataloggers during fieldwork. Although we found statistically significant differences between the temperatures recorded by uncoated and coated iButtons, and also between uncoated and coated iButtons embedded in frog models, these effects were relatively small (0 – 1. 3 °C). We also found that <b>coating</b> iButtons <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> reduced the likelihood of device failure under field conditions (from 8. 3 % to 0 %). We conclude that <b>coating</b> Thermochron iButtons <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> is an affordable and reliable method of waterproofing dataloggers that prevents device failure and data loss with minimal influence on temperature readings...|$|R
40|$|Microsticks are machine-tooled or molded pegs {{of plastic}} or {{stainless}} steel which were developed as solid-phase carriers for the {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA). They consist of a stem, which can be <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> {{to be used as}} the reactive surface, and a shaft designed for easy handling and labeling and for positioning the sticks in microtiter wells and transfer plates. Microsticks permit a wide selection of coating materials and afford the user greater control over quality and standardization of the solid-phase surface. Polycarbonate and nitrocellulose coatings were tested in ELISAs for antibodies to measles virus, toxoplasma, and human gamma globulin.

5000|$|Fly fishing - {{the use of}} {{artificial}} flies as lures. These are cast with specially constructed fly rods and fly lines. The fly line (today, almost always <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> <b>plastic)</b> is heavy enough cast in order to send the fly to the target. Artificial flies vary dramatically in size, weight and colour. Fly fishing is a distinct and ancient angling method, most renowned as a method for catching trout and salmon, but employed today {{for a wide variety}} of species including pike, bass, panfish, and carp, as well as marine species, such as redfish, snook, tarpon, bonefish and striped bass. There is a growing population of anglers whose aim is to catch as many different species as possible with the fly.|$|R
50|$|The food {{industry}} finds ultrasonic welding preferable to traditional joining techniques, {{because it is}} fast, sanitary and can produce hermetic seals. Milk and juice containers are examples of products often sealed using ultrasonic welding. The paper parts to be sealed are <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> <b>plastic,</b> generally polypropylene or polyethylene, and then welded together to create an airtight seal. The main obstacle to overcome in this process is {{the setting of the}} parameters. For example, if over-welding occurs, then the concentration of plastic in the weld zone may be too low and cause the seal to break. If it is under-welded, the seal is incomplete. Variations in the thicknesses of materials can cause variations in weld quality. Some other food items sealed using ultrasonic welding include candy bar wrappers, frozen food packages and beverage containers.|$|R

25|$|In fly fishing, {{fish are}} caught by using {{artificial}} flies that are cast with a fly rod and a fly line. The fly line (today, almost always <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> <b>plastic)</b> is heavy {{enough to send}} the fly to the target. The main difference between fly fishing and spin or bait fishing is that in fly fishing {{the weight of the}} line carries the hook through the air, whereas in spin and bait fishing the weight of the lure or sinker {{at the end of the}} monofilament or braided line gives casting distance. Artificial flies are of several types; some imitating an insect (either flying or swimming), others a bait fish or crustacean, others attractors are known to attract fish although they look like nothing in nature. Flies can be made either to float or sink, and range in size from a few millimeters to 30cm long; most are between 1 and 5cm.|$|R

50|$|Acids {{can be used}} {{to learn}} more about fossil eggs. Diluted acetic acid or EDTA {{can be used to}} expose the {{microstructure}} of shell that has been damaged by weathering. Acids are also used to extract embryo skeletons from the egg encasing them. Even fossilized soft tissue like muscle and cartilage as well as fat globules from the original egg yolk can be uncovered using this method. Amateur paleontologist Terry Manning has been credited with groundbreaking work developing this technique. First, the paleontologist must submerge the egg in a very dilute phosphoric acid bath. Since the acid solution can penetrate the egg, every few days the specimen must be soaked in distilled water to prevent the acid from damaging the embryo before it is even exposed. If embryonic fossil bone is revealed after drying from the water bath, the exposed fossils must be delicately cleaned with fine instruments like needles and paint brushes. The exposed bone is then <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> preservatives like Acryloid B67, Paraloid B72, or Vinac B15 to protect it from the acid when submerged for another round. The complete process can take months before the whole embryo is revealed. Even then only about 20% of the eggs subjected to the process reveal any embryo fossils at all.|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objectives}} {{of this project}} were {{to find out if}} fiber-based materials could be creped by creasing process and to design creping patterns that affect the material elongation. Special attention was paid to the difference in the ratio of strain-at-break values between machine and cross direction of paper and paperboard. Scientific principles were used to design the creping pattern. Various techniques were used to analyze the physical and mechanical properties of the creped substrates. In order to analyze the creped samples, microscopic analysis was performed to find the cracks in the substrates. Likewise, tensile strength, bending stiffness, tear strength and grease barrier experiments were performed. Thickness and density were reported in the initial phase of the thesis project. Copy paper performed well, because it was thin and rather dense. However, thick and bulky paperboards were trickier since the force the creasing table produced was limited and probably more force would have been needed for more rigid materials such as three-layer paperboard. The ratio between machine and cross directional elongation (strain ratio) as well as percentual changes in strain at break were reported in the result. It was found that creping made the strain properties of plastics-coated materials more heterogeneous, which suggests that the paperboard should be creped before <b>coating</b> <b>with</b> <b>plastics...</b>|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the research was to reduce the organic and nutrient load under the net pen fish farms. An exper- iment was conducted to {{study the effects of}} artificial barriers fixed under a set of sea cages {{in order to reduce the}} envi- ronmental impact. The artificial barriers were made of four submerged galvanized steel pipes <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> and placed on the sea floor (10 m depth) in the Trieste gulf. The experimental design was as follows: control (C), cages with barriers (B), cages without barriers (WB). Measurements were taken on the surface as well as at 4 and 8 m of depth. The trial lasted from the end of June 2000 to December 2001. Water quality parameters were not significantly influenced by the fish cages. Surface samples were characterised by lower levels of salinity and higher levels of oxygen and nitrate compared to those taken at 4 and 8 m. The artificial barriers favoured the establishment of a rich epiphytic fauna that took advantage of the presence of organic matter derived from fish cages. The two species Nucula nucleusand Neanthes caudataand the total bacterial counts were identified as potential indicators of pollution under the fish cage farms...|$|R
40|$|A {{pioneering}} {{approach to}} the design of a ligand selective for the 8 opioid receptors was imple-mented by Mosberg et al. (1983) who demon-strated that the cyclic conformationally restricted enkephalin analog (2 -D-penicillamine, 5 -D-penicil-lamine) enkephalin (DPDPE) displayed extremely high specificity toward the 8 opioid receptors. Recently Akiyama et al. (1985) provided the first in vitro characterization f tritium labeled DPDPE binding to 8 opioid receptors in the rat brain and neuroblastoma-glioma hybrid (NG 108 - 15) cells. In the present study we examined the light microscopic autoradiographic distribution of opioid receptors in the rat central nervous ystem employing the highly selective 8 agonist [3 H]DPDPE (S.

40|$|International audiencePrevious {{experimental}} and numerical results {{have shown that}} in multi-MeV Bremsstrahlung x-ray sources created by picosecond laser pulses, the delivered on-axis dose increases if the laser interacts with under-critical plasmas. The effect of the laser-plasma interaction {{as a function of}} the plasma density gradient is thus first studied here, by focusing the short pulse of the Alisé laser on a solid tantalum target <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> <b>plastic.</b> Interaction conditions are modified by irradiating the target front side with a secondary nanosecond heating beam, prior to the main pulse. The length of the expanding plasma is modified by adjusting the delay between the interaction and heating beams. Various diagnostics give access to a whole set of consistent experimental results on the x-ray source properties which are compared successfully to self-consistent numerical simulations obtained with coupled PIC and Monte Carlo codes. All source parameters increase as the plasma length increases, in reason of the increasing number of high-energy electrons near the axis. In a second part of this talk, we use our simulation tools to predict the x-ray and neutron (produced by photonuclear interactions in the target) flash characteristics that can be expected on future PW lasers. Favourable scaling laws for the production of an intense, directional and short duration x-ray source versus intensity are observed. However, these findings also stress that radioprotection will become an important issue for future petawatt lasers operating at the kJ level...|$|R
