2500|$|All this {{knowledge}} {{was transferred to}} the Greeks probably shortly after the conquest by Alexander the Great (331 BC). According to the late classical philosopher Simplicius (early 6th century AD), Alexander ordered the translation of the historical astronomical records under supervision of his chronicler Callisthenes of Olynthus, who sent it to his uncle Aristotle. Although Simplicius is a very late source, his account may be reliable. He spent some time in exile at the Sassanid (Persian) court, and may have accessed sources otherwise lost in the West. It is striking that he mentions the title tèresis (Greek: guard), which is an odd name for a historical work, but is an adequate translation of the Babylonian title massartu meaning guarding, but also observing. [...] Anyway, Aristotle's pupil Callippus of Cyzicus introduced his 76-year cycle, which improved on the 19-year Metonic cycle, about that time.

[...] So Callippus may have obtained his data from Babylonian sources and his calendar may have been anticipated by Kidinnu. Also it is known that the Babylonian priest known as Berossus wrote around 281 BC a book in Greek on the (rather mythological) history of Babylonia, the Babyloniaca, for the new ruler Antiochus I; it is said that later he founded a school of astrology on the Greek island of Kos.

40|$|The rat {{fibroblast}} NRK {{cells are}} transformed reversibly {{by a combination}} of growth factors. When stimulated with serum, NRK cells rely on cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk 4) for their S phase entry. However, when stimulated with serum containing oncogenic growth factors, they come to rely on either Cdk 4 or Cdk 6, and their S phase entry cannot be blocked unless both Cdk 4 and Cdk 6 are immunodepleted. Such change of dependence does not occur in the NRK cell mutants defective in an oncogenic signal pathway and, therefore, deficient in anchorage-independent cell <b>cycle</b> <b>start</b> ability, correlating Cdk 6 dependence with this remarkable, cancer-associated phenotype. However, both Cdk 4 and Cdk 6 are activated upon serum stimulation, and neither the amounts of Cdk 6, Cdk 4, cyclin D 1, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors nor the activities or subcellular localization of Cdk 6 and Cdk 4 are significantly influenced by oncogenic stimulation. Thus, oncogenic stimulation invokes Cdk 6 to participate in a critical step of the cell <b>cycle</b> <b>start</b> in a rat fibroblast, but by a mechanism seemingly unrelated to the regulation of the kinase. Given that many hematopoietic cells employ predominantly Cdk 6 for the cell <b>cycle</b> <b>start</b> and perform anchorage-independent growth by nature, our results raise the possibility that the oncogenic stimulation-induced anchorage-independent cell <b>cycle</b> <b>start</b> of NRK is elicited by a mechanism similar to the one used for hematopoietic cell proliferation...|$|E
40|$|The Cln 3 cyclin homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{functions}} to promote cell <b>cycle</b> <b>START</b> {{for only a}} short time following its synthesis. Cln 3 protein is highly unstable and is stabilized by C-terminal truncation. Cln 3 binds to Cdc 28, a protein kinase catalytic subunit essential for cell <b>cycle</b> <b>START,</b> and Cln 3 instability requires Cdc 28 activity. The long functional lifetime and the hyperactivity of C-terminally truncated Cln 3 (Cln 3 - 2) relative to those of full-length Cln 3 are affected by mutations in CDC 28 : the functional lifetime of Cln 3 - 2 is drastically reduced by the cdc 28 - 13 mutation at the permissive temperature, and the cdc 28 - 4 mutation at the permissive temperature completely blocks the function of Cln 3 - 2 while only partially reducing the function of full-length Cln 3. Thus, sequences in the C-terminal third of Cln 3 might help stabilize functional Cdc 28 -Cln 3 association, as well as decreasing the lifetime of the Cln 3 protein. These and other results strongly support the idea that Cln proteins function to activate Cdc 28 at START...|$|E
