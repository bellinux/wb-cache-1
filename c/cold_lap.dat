40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the classification and effect of <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> weld defect onthe fatigue strength of a welded structure. <b>Cold</b> <b>lap</b> is a type of weld defect whichoccurs when molten metal does not completely fuse with the cold plate surface. Thisproduces a crack like defect, often very small, which is parallel to the plate. The coldlap weld defect has been classified into three types namely spatter, overlap andspatter-overlap <b>cold</b> <b>lap.</b> Study showed that all three types of <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> defects have thecorresponded lack of fusion in the interface, which could be considered as initialmacro cracks in different shapes where a possible fatigue crack growth could start. Fatigue life assessment of the above mentioned three types of <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> defects wascarried out using finite element and crack growth analysis in 2 D and 3 D. In the 2 Danalysis the <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> defects were modeled as line crack (assuming a/c= 0). Based onthe experiments the <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> defects were visualized as having two probable crackshapes; penny shaped and part through, which required 3 D crack growth analysis. Results showed that in 2 D analysis the three types of <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> defects have sameinfluence on fatigue life of the weld. In 3 D analysis, the shape of the <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> defectsdid not show any difference in fatigue life. Overall penny shaped and part throughcracks in 3 D analysis predicted 1. 75 times longer fatigue life as compared to line crackin 2 D analysis...|$|E
40|$|Straight {{break or}} {{transverse}} fissure {{is one of}} the most common failure modes associated with aluminothermic welds in Australian heavy haul railways. Straight break as a fatigue failure mainly nucleates from stress concentration sites at the weld collar edge and propagates in a near vertical direction under mode I crack opening. The reduction of fatigue performance influenced by the collar features and harsh operational conditions has been investigated using multi-axial fatigue analysis and validated on the basis of in-service failures. Practical observations suggest that a major contributor to the occurrence of many straight breaks is a specific defect known as finning or <b>cold</b> <b>lap.</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>lap</b> is a condition where excess weld material leaks out of the welding mould forming an unfused appendix on the rail surface. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks associated with the <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> defect through numerical analysis and fracture mechanics. A thermostructural finite element model of a track portion incorporating an aluminothermic weld with a <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> defect is developed and the <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> is treated as a planar crack. Sensitivity analysis is performed on <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> geometric parameters and some operational conditions. The results show that the probability of crack initiation from a <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> defect largely depends on the lap thickness, lap tip location and the wheel-rail contact conditions. In particular, contact patch eccentricity and lateral tractive forces as a result of curving and hunting behaviour can increase the risk of crack nucleation...|$|E
40|$|Tandem gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW) is a high {{productivity}} welding process which is applied in many industries. However, a type of imperfection, known as <b>cold</b> <b>lap,</b> was revealed that mostly accompanies the tandem GMAW process. <b>Cold</b> <b>lap</b> is a small lack of fusion in size at the weld toe which can have a negative influence on the fatigue life of the weld [1, 2]. It generally runs parallel {{to the surface of the}} parent plate. Due to its small size, it has not been successful to detect <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> by any non‐destructive test (NDT) method. With a lot of work, it has been noticed that it is hard to produce a weld without cold laps. Even for some post‐treatment methods, e. g. TIG‐dressing, <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> cannot be eliminated completely [2]. Therefore, a better understanding of the formation mechanism is required to be able to avoid their formation. The main objectives of this thesis are to classify cold laps, to characterise <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> interfaces, and to investigate the main influencing factors on <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> formation. For this purpose, several series tandem GMAW experiments were performed. Domex 355 MC was used as the base metal and OK Autrod 12. 51 Φ 1. 2 was used as the consumable material. Different shielding gases (pure argon and pure carbon dioxide) and surface conditions (blasted surface and milled surface) of the base metal were applied. A sealed chamber was used in the experiment to ensure a non‐oxidising or oxidising welding environment. Cross sections of the cold laps were prepared by a conventional metallographic method, e. g. cutting, mounting, polishing, and etching (if necessary). The metallographic samples were evaluated with the help of both a light optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an attached energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Also, the interface between spatter and base metal was investigated using the same method as an assistant study of cold laps. The results showed three types of cold laps, i. e. spatter <b>cold</b> <b>lap,</b> overlap <b>cold</b> <b>lap,</b> and spatteroverlap <b>cold</b> <b>lap.</b> The <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> is mostly composed of voids and oxides. For the materials (welding consumables and parent materials) used in the experiments, the oxides were shown to be manganese‐silicon oxides (Mn‐Si oxides). It was also found that Mn‐Si oxides have a significant influence on the occurrence of overlap <b>cold</b> <b>lap.</b> The blasted surface condition can have a minor effect on enhancing cold laps. By studying the spatter/base metal interface, it is believed that temperature/energy are the other important factors for the formation of cold laps...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to classify and characterize the small lack of fusion defects, called <b>cold</b> <b>lap,</b> located at the weld toe. Since the defects are very small (0. 01 – 1. 5 mm) and diffi cult to detect by NDT methods, {{a better understanding of the}} formation mechanism is required to be able to avoid their formation. The investigation consisted of two parts. Firstly, a study was made on the type and frequency of cold laps. Three types were identified, namely “spatter cold lap”, and “overlap cold lap” and “spatter-overlap cold lap”. No relation between type or frequency of cold laps and the welding parameters could be established. Secondly, the interface between spatter and the base material was investigated using optical and scanning electron microscopy, to better understand the <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> formation mechanism.

40|$|Cold laps {{are defined}} as micro-lack of fusion defects at the weld toe more or less {{parallel}} {{to the surface of}} the parent plate. These defects are known to negatively influence the fatigue properties of weldments. Previous studies suggest that <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> formation can not be avoided completely in Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW). Therefore, a better understanding of formation mechanisms is imperative to be able to minimize the number and size of these defects. The main objective of this work has been to provide a more comprehensive understanding of cold laps, including categorising, characterisation and defining the most significant factors for formation. GMAW was used to produce welds that were investigated by metallographic methods using light optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry. A novel classification of cold laps was introduced and three types of cold laps were identified: spatter cold laps, overlap cold laps and spatter-overlap cold laps. It was shown that cold laps are partially or fully filled by oxides. The most common oxides are manganese silicon oxides which were concluded to be formed primarily by oxidation of droplets. The presence of oxides was found to significantly increase the tendency to form spatter cold laps as well as overlap cold laps. Particularly for overlap cold laps, it was found that the depth (in transverse direction of weld) is reduced when welding in a non-oxidising environment. Welding on blasted surfaces increased the <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> formation by entrapment of gas. The droplet and base metal temperatures were also found to be significant factors in <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> formation. For overlap cold laps the occurrence frequency decreased with increased preheating temperature of the base metal. Mechanisms of overflowing resulting in overlap cold laps were discussed based on an extensive literature review. Several phenomena are believed to contribute to overflow including Rayleigh instability, the balance of forces, transfer of lateral momentum by droplets and an outward Marangoni fluid flow of the weld pool. The present studies suggest that <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> formation can be suppressed by ensuring that the welding process (arc) is as stable as possible and by welding on a preheated work piece in a non-oxidising environment...|$|E
40|$|Friction stir {{lap welding}} of 7 B 04 {{aluminum}} alloy {{was conducted in}} the present paper, {{and the effect of}} welding speed on the defect features and mechanical performance of lap joints was investigated. The results indicate that the hook defect at the advancing side (AS) can reduce the effective thickness of the top sheet, and the sheet thinning level is gradually lowered by increasing the welding speed. The <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> defect at the retreating side (RS) can result in effective thickness reduction in both top and bottom sheets, and the total height of the <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> defect varies slightly with the welding speed. The tensile properties of the lap joints are largely related to the sheet thinning levels caused by the defects. The fracture strength of AS-loaded lap joints is progressively increased with increasing welding speed, while that of RS-loaded lap joints evolves slightly with welding speed. It is found that the affecting characteristic of loading configuration on the joint performance is also dependent on the welding speed. At lower welding speeds, the AS-loaded lap joints show lower fracture strength than the RS-loaded lap joints. When the welding speed is high, the AS-loaded lap joints present superior tensile properties to RS-loaded lap joints...|$|E

40|$|Cold laps {{are small}} {{incomplete}} fusion defects that are {{located at the}} weld toe. These defects have recently {{been shown to have}} severe influence on the fatigue life of components which undergo vibrations (or cycling loadings) such as automotive components. The small size of the cold laps, i. e. average size 0. 05 - 0. 3 mm, makes them difficult to detect with conventional NDT tools. Hence, better understanding of their formation is necessary to be able to avoid their formation. The objective {{of this study was to}} classify and characterize <b>cold</b> <b>lap</b> defects.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this research project was to investigate phenomena involved in the filling of die cavities with molten alloy in the cold chamber die-casting process.

Locating gates to avoid undesirable flow patterns that may entrap air in the casting is critical to casting quality - as locating vents to allow air to escape from the cavity (last places to fill).

It {{was found that}} the effective absorptivity of the Cu increased as the oxygen content of the Ar assist gas was increased. This facilitated laser welding of Cu at much lower laser powers and increased weld penetration. The use of oxygenated assist gas promoted nucleation and growth of submicroscopic oxide particles within the weld metal. These particles dispersion-strengthened the weld metal, thereby increasing both weld metal hardness and strength.

In this master thesis, thetoe radius has been studied more carefully along with the selection of reliable measurementsystems which are able to measure the toe radius along the weld.

FE-simulations anddestructive fatigue testing has also been carried out to determine which radial geometry beingcritical to the fatigue life. The {{results show that the}} currently used methods and gauges do not provide the requiredaccuracy when measuring the toe radius. The gauges are handled differently by differentoperators – even when using the vision system – which makes the methods subjective andtherefore unreliable. There are measuring systems that can gather surface data along the weldwith high accuracy, but there is no reliable method to assess the data. Therefore, the authors havedeveloped an algorithm – named STELIN – that assess the gathered surface data andautomatically identifies and calculates the toe radius and the toe angle along the weld. Using thatinformation an opportunity to improve the process control when welding is possible. The performed FE-calculations show that the surface roughness in the weld toe probably has aninfluence at the fatigue life of the joint. A more precise separate study should be made todetermine the impact of the surface roughness on the fatigue life. Those results should serve as abase when reviewing the theory used when predicting the fatigue life. Currently, stress averagingapproach is used in the notches of the root and the weld toe.

Regarding measuring the surface roughness in the weld toe, theevaluated vision system has enough accuracy to deliver reliable data. More work remains with the STELIN-algorithm.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{is concerned with}} fatigue life of welded structures. Several topics related to fatigue of welded structures are treated such as; weld defects and their influence on fatigue performance of welded structures, fatigue life prediction using LEFM (Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics), fatigue testing, welding simulation, residual stress prediction and measurement and their influence on fatigue life. The work that is reported in this {{doctoral thesis}} is part results of the Nordic R&D project QFAB (Quality and Cost of Fabricated Advanced Welded Structures) and the Swedish R&D project LOST (Light Optimized Welded Structures). One of the main objectives is to compare different welding processes for the fatigue performance, weld quality and gain understanding of the weld defects, their appearance in different welding processes and their effect on fatigue life. Another main objective is to study welding residual stresses and their effect on fatigue. The design rules are in some cases conservative and especially on the weld root sides the knowledge about the residual stress field may improve the life prediction. The aim is to develop simplified procedures for analysis of residual stresses, their relaxation and influence on fatigue life. Fatigue testing of Hybrid Nd: YAG laser/MAG and MAG welded (tandem arc solid wire, flux cored wire, tandem flux cored wire) non-load carrying cruciform joints was carried out. Four batches were produced, tested {{and the results were}} compared. The local weld geometry of the cruciform welded joints was measured and analyzed. Residual stress measurement was carried out close to the toe region using X-ray diffraction. Weld defects, in most cases <b>cold</b> <b>laps,</b> in the cracked specimens were measured. Further fatigue testing, weld defect assessment and residual stress and local weld geometry measurements were carried out on joints welded with flux cored and metal cored arc wires. Two-and three dimensional LEFM crack growth analysis were carried out in order to predict the influence of weld defects, local weld geometry and residual stresses. Residual stresses in multi-pass welded tube-to-plates were studied for two different tubular joint configurations; a three-pass single-U weld groove for maximum weld penetration and a two-pass fillet (no groove) welded tube-to-plates for minimum weld penetration. Torsion fatigue tests were performed in order to study crack propagation from the weld root. Mode III propagation from the lower and upper weld toe on the same tubular joints was also studied. Some tubes were stress relieved (PWHT) and some were fatigue tested with internal static pressure. A three dimensional finite element welding simulation of the multi-pass welded tubular joint was carried out. The calculated temperatures in the transient thermal analysis were compared with measured temperatures. The FE predicted residual stresses in the as-welded conditions were verified with hole drilling strain gage measurements. The residual stresses were used as internal stresses in the finite element model for the torsion fatigue simulation in order to study the cycle by cycle relaxation of the residual stresses in constant amplitude torsion loading. A two dimensional finite element welding simulation procedure was developed in order to predict welding residual stress. The predicted residual stresses were used together with a developed 2 D LEFM subroutine to predict the fatigue life, crack path and the effect of residual stresses on weld root defects. The developed simulation subroutines were validated with results found in the literature. Residual stresses measurement, two-and three dimensional welding simulations were carried out in fillet welded joints in order to study the three dimensional effects of the welding process, boundary conditions and modelling technique on the formation of residual stresses.

The song suited that kind of imagery so well, I thought it was a no-brainer to put the down and outs and all the characters in. It was a quick shoot, maybe two nights." ...|$|R
50|$|While {{racing in}} Sweden {{had a long}} history it was not until 1931 that a race was first titled Grand Prix. The first Swedish Winter Grand Prix was held on a mammoth 46 {{kilometre}} circuit near Lake Rämen about 2 hours northwest of Stockholm in the snow and freezing <b>cold</b> with a <b>lap</b> time of approximately 35 minutes. In 1933 the first Swedish Summer Grand Prix was held on a 30 kilometre cricuit at Norra Vram not far north from Malmö, a race which can be better compared to modern Grands Prix. The opening lap saw a multi-car pile-up which saw several drivers injured, two seriously, and a riding mechanic was killed. One of the crashed cars started a fire which saw a nearby house burned to the ground. The race continued while emergency services attended the scene and the race was eventually won by Antonio Brivio (Alfa Romeo). Major racing came to a halt after that. There were three sports cars races held between 1955 and 1957, with the latter two being part of the World Sportscar Championship, meanwhile 1967, the name Swedish Grand Prix was, as a one-off name, given to that year's Kanonloppet in Karlskoga. It was run to Formula Two rules and Jochen Rindt won.|$|R
