5|$|Costello {{picks up}} the trenchcoat and shoots more {{subordinates}} who get in his way. Fung is finally the last surviving member, so he attempts to walk nonchalantly by Costello, relying on the Frenchman's inability to recognize him without the coat, but as he is walking by, Costello sees a sticker on Fung's tie. Both men shoot at each other. Fung is hit and Costello demands that he put the <b>coat</b> <b>on,</b> which Fung refuses, so Costello shoots him in the leg. Fung puts the <b>coat</b> <b>on,</b> Costello checks the bullet holes in the coat and sees that they align with the bullets stuck in the bullet-proof vest he was wearing. Costello then stands up and fires a round into Fung's head killing him. Costello is last seen eating and laughing with the woman and children.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish Terrier {{typically}} has a hard, wiry outer {{coat with}} a soft, dense undercoat.

5|$|The first {{region on}} either side of the bilayer is the {{hydrophilic}} headgroup. This portion of the membrane is completely hydrated and is typically around 0.8-0.9nm thick. In phospholipid bilayers the phosphate group is located within this hydrated region, approximately 0.5nm outside the hydrophobic core. In some cases, the hydrated region can extend much further, for instance in lipids with a large protein or long sugar chain grafted to the head. One common example of such a modification in nature is the lipopolysaccharide <b>coat</b> <b>on</b> a bacterial outer membrane, which helps retain a water layer around the bacterium to prevent dehydration.|$|E

Stanley and Phyllis respond with their usual disinterest in helping others, so Jim offers to treat them to lunch. Stanley and Phyllis order extra side dishes and help themselves to an excess of wine, annoying Jim with drunken behavior and silencing him whenever he brings up the subject of their covering for him. When they arrive back at the office, a drunk Stanley and Phyllis are seemingly passed out in the backseat of Jim's car. When Jim puts his <b>coat</b> <b>on</b> them to keep them warm, Phyllis and Stanley say they will cover for him as they care for Jim and his family, laughing as they reveal they were only pranking him. Jim gives both of them a hug.|$|E

40|$|Al-AlCr was <b>coated</b> <b>on</b> Mg-Ca and Mg-Zn-Ce-La alloys using {{physical}} vapor deposition method. The {{surface morphology}} of the specimens was characterized by x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM {{results indicated that the}} average surface roughness of Al-AlCr <b>coating</b> <b>on</b> the Mg-Ca alloy is much lower than that of Al-AlCr <b>coating</b> <b>on</b> the Mg-Zn-Ce-La alloy. However, Al-AlCr <b>coating</b> <b>on</b> the Mg-Ca alloy presented a more compact structure with fewer pores, pinholes, and cracks than Al-AlCr <b>coating</b> <b>on</b> the Mg-Zn-Ce-La alloy. Electrochemical studies revealed that the novel coating (Al-AlCr) can remarkably reduce the corrosion rate of the Mg-Ca alloy in 3. 5 wt. % NaCl solution. It was seen that the anodic current density of the Al-AlCr-coated Mg-Ca alloy was very small when compared to the Al-AlCr-coated Mg-Zn-Ce-La and uncoated alloys. Impedance modulus (Z) of the Al-AlCr-coated samples was higher than that of the bare Mg alloys.

25|$|The {{adults are}} black with a silvery-gray <b>coat</b> <b>on</b> the thorax and abdomen. They are 6 to 7mm long, with clear wings and {{yellowish}} calypters. The knob of the haltere is yellow while the stalk is brownish yellow. The dorsal abdomen has a dark median stripe {{that produces a}} series of triangular markings with the segmentally arranged transverse bands. The thorax of the adult has three longitudinal stripes. They are darker than F. canicularis. The tibia on the mesothoraic leg has a distinct process, and the coxae have two setae at the apex. The fourth vein on the wing of this species is straight, as compared to it being curved in the house fly. There is a great variance between the sexes of this species, and more {{is known about the}} male. For instance; their mid femur does not have blunt spines, the ventral tubercle of the mid tibia is indistinct, and the abdomen has no spots or stripes and is short and broad.|$|E
25|$|Otter, {{commanded}} by Captain Dorr, was fitted out at Boston, and despatched to Sydney, where she anchored on 25 January 1796. Captain Dorr {{and a few}} of his crew landed at the very spot where Mr. Muir was located (the vicinity of Jeffrey Street in the modern suburb of Kirribilli), under the pretence that they were proceeding to China and were in want of fresh water. The captain had an audience with Mr Muir, and not a moment was lost. On the morning of 11 February 1796, Muir was safely taken on board Otter, which instantly set sail. Other accounts state that Muir rowed out of the harbour and met Otter outside the Heads. Muir's own account of his escape, as given in subsequent letters preserved in Spanish archives, is that Captain Dorr, coming into Port Jackson in January 1796 agreed to give him a passage to Boston provided he could effect his escape without danger to Dorr. On the evening of February 18, the day before Dorr was to sail, Muir put to sea in a small boat, with two servants, taking nothing with him but the shirt and <b>coat</b> <b>on</b> his back, and that about the middle of the next day they boarded Otter at a considerable distance from land. One account states that as many as 20 convicts escaped from the penal colony in Port Jackson aboard Otter. Three of the convicts were left on Nomuka Island in Ha'apai Tonga on 15 March 1796.|$|E

500|$|He led the Vale {{to victory}} over Championship sides Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday {{in the opening}} rounds of the League Cup. However {{following}} {{a period of three}} defeats in seven days, Adams decided to place his whole squad on the transfer list, saying of his team's performance: [...] "We looked like a woman who had a big fur <b>coat</b> <b>on</b> but underneath she’s got no knickers on." [...] It was a controversial move, one that divided opinion among analysts and fans, also bringing the fourth tier club to national attention. He later admitted he merely played [...] "a psychological game with them... I don't think they fell for it – I don't think anybody fell for it". Three wins – including a cup win over League One Stockport County and a league win at local rivals Crewe Alexandra – and three draws within four weeks saw Adams nominated for the League Two Manager of the Month award for October 2009. In the January 2010 transfer window he signed winger Lewis Haldane permanently, and took winger Sean Rigg and striker Craig Davies on loan. Adams' men stormed into the play-off places {{for the first time in}} the season with just two games left to play, following a 2–1 win over champions-elect Notts County. Yet with just one point from their final two games, the Vale finished the season in 10th place.|$|E

Brown usually performed it wearing a black outfit, flanked with two male dancers wearing white clothes. On the February 4, 1989, show at Madison Square Garden in New York City, Brown wore a red boxing robe with the words [...] "King of the Stage" [...] printed on the back. During the performance, Joseph Simmons of Run-DMC, LL Cool J and Heavy D joined him onstage and freestyle rapped. Eric B., KRS-One, L. A. Reid, Babyface and Teddy Riley also joined him onstage, with the latter performing a keyboard solo. Peter Watrous of The New York Times commented that, [...] "The communal scene on stage mirrored the feeling in the audience; everybody seemed aware {{that this was a}} generation that had rewritten the rules of pop entertainment, and was justifiably proud of its achievement". Brown also performed the song at the 1997 Home Again Tour with New Edition, during the second portion of the show in which he performed hits from his solo career. On November 10, 2005, he performed the song {{for the first time in}} eight years at a concert at House of Blues in Atlantic City. He wore a white suit and matching hat, and sang it as the last song of the evening. On January 17, 2006, he performed it at a New Edition show in Atlantic City's Trump Taj Mahal. During the performance, he tore open his orange dress shirt, singing bare-chested with a tie and a fur <b>coat</b> <b>on.</b> Brown performed the song during his 2007 July shows in Australia.|$|E
