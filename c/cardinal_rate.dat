40|$|In {{the last}} 30 - 40 years multicriteria-based {{approaches}} have been strongly applied to financial decision-making problems. The contributions that use multicriteria methodologies {{in order to}} evaluate the creditworthiness of debtors and loan applicants belong to this research field and mainly refer to applications of UTADIS and ELECTRE methods. In this paper authors themselves propose a deterministic approach for creditworthiness evaluation based on the multicriteria method known as MURAME, which has been applied {{for the first time}} to creditworthiness assessment problems by the authors themselves. The MURAME-based approach proposed by the authors is articulated in two phases: a rating assignment phase, and a rating quantification phase. The first one is mainly devoted to determine the debtors’ rating classes, whereas the second phase allows to obtain estimates of the probabilities of default and of transition, and permits to calculate quantities providing further information about the (<b>cardinal)</b> <b>rating</b> and the (ordinal) ranking of the debtors’ credit quality. The proposed approach is applied to an important north eastern Italian bank, the Banca Popolare di Vicenza, in order to evaluate the creditworthiness in a real case...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} estimating a class of smooth functions defined everywhere on a real line utilizing nonparametric kernel regression estimators. Such functions have an interpretation as signals and are common in communication theory. Furthermore, they have finite energy, bounded frequency content and often are jammed by noise. We examine the expected L 2 -error of two types of estimators, one is a classical kernel regression estimator utilizing kernel functions of order p, p [greater-or-equal, slanted] 2 {{and the other one}} is motivated by the Whittaker-Shannon sampling expansion. The latter estimator employs a non-integrable kernel function sin(t) /nt, t [epsilon]. The comparison shows that the second technique outperforms the first one as long as the frequency band is finite.

40|$|Apart from {{morphology}} {{and genetic}} characteristics, species status of Pythium zingiberis and P. myriotylum {{may also be}} confirmed based on their pathogenicity and host range. An Australian putative P. zingiberis isolate and imported type isolates of P. myriotylum and P. zingiberis were subject to both in vitro and in vivo pathogenicity tests. In vitro tests were carried out on excised carrot, ginger, potato, radish, and sweet potato tuber/root sections, and on seeds and seedlings of cucumber, cauliflower, millet, rye, sweet corn, tomato, and wheat. In all assays conducted, the Australian isolate {{was found to be}} the most pathogenic, followed by type specimen of P. zingiberis (UOP 275), and then the type specimen P. myriotylum (CBS 254. 70). An in vivo experiment on ginger plants at 35 °C (with 10 h day light) in quarantine conditions showed that the ginger plants inoculated with the Australian isolate and also the type specimen of P. zingiberis died at 21 days after inoculation, whereas those inoculated with P. myriotylum CBS 254. 70 were still green and healthy. Along with <b>cardinal</b> growth <b>rate,</b> the Australian isolate was confirmed to be closely related to P. zingiberis. This is also the first direct comparison in pathogenicity of P. zingiberis and P. myriotylum...|$|R
40|$|During a {{study on}} the phylogenetic {{relationships}} between species in the Phytophthora cryptogea complex and related species, Phytophthora erythroseptica and Phytophthora sansomeana, 19 hybrid isolates with multiple polymorphisms in the nuclear sequences were observed. Molecular characterization of hybrids was achieved by sequencing three nuclear (internal transcribed spacers, β-tubulin (TUB), heat shock protein 90) and two mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (coxI), NADH dehydrogenase subunit I (NADH)) gene regions and cloning of the single-copy nuclear gene, TUB. Based on the molecular studies the hybrid isolates belonged to six distinct groups between P. cryptogea, P. erythroseptica, Phytophthora pseudocryptogea, P. sansomeana, and Phytophthora sp. kelmania. In all cases, only a single coxI and NADH allele was detected and nuclear genes were biparentally inherited, suggesting that the hybrids arose from sexual recombination events. Colony morphology, growth <b>rate,</b> <b>cardinal</b> temperatures, breeding system, and morphology of sporangia, oogonia, oospores, and antheridia were also determined. Some morphological differences between the hybrids and the parental species were noted; however, they were not sufficient to reliably distinguish the taxa and DNA markers from nuclear and mitochondrial genes will to be necessary for their identification. The parental species are all important pathogens of agricultural fields that have been transported globally. With the apparent ease of hybridization within this group there is ample opportunity for virulent hybrids to form, perhaps with extended host ranges...|$|R
40|$|Decreasing water {{availability}} for rice based systems {{resulted in the}} introduction of water saving produc-tion systems such as aerobic rice and alternate wetting–drying technology. To further improve resourceuse efficiency in these systems, water management should be attuned to critical growth stages, requiringaccurate prediction of crop phenology. Photoperiod-sensitivity of aerobic rice genotypes complicates theestimation of the parameters characterising phenological development and hence impairs predictions. Toovercome this complication, we followed a two-step approach: (1) the photoperiod response was deter-mined in growth chambers, through a reciprocal transfer experiment with variable day length, conductedat a fixed temperature, and consecutively, (2) the temperature response was studied by combining theobtained photoperiod parameters with data from field experiments. All four aerobic rice genotypes testedexhibited strong photoperiod-sensitivity. Durations of basic vegetative phase (BVP) i. e. when plants arestill insensitive to photoperiod, photoperiod-sensitive phase (PSP), and post-PSP (PPP) varied amonggenotypes. The temperature response of the genotypes was explored by combining phenological observa-tions in the reciprocal transfer experiment with observations in two field experiments. The temperaturerange in the field experiments was too narrow to obtain convergence to {{a unique set of}} temperatureresponse parameters, regardless whether a bilinear or a beta model was used. Sensitivity analysis how-ever provided clear arguments in support of the recent doubts on the validity of a commonly used set ofcardinal temperatures for rice phenology. Using standard <b>cardinal</b> temperatures, the <b>rate</b> of developmentat temperatures below 31 ¿C was overestimated. This finding stresses the need for experiments on ricephenology under a wider range of temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} pH and water {{activity}} (aw) on {{the formation of}} biofilm by Salmonella enterica ser. Newport, previously identified as a strong biofilm producer, was assessed. Biofilm formation was evaluated in tryptone soy broth at 37 C and at different combinations of pH (3. 3 e 7. 8) and aw (0. 894 e 0. 997). In total, 540 biofilm formation tests in 108 pH and aw combinations were carried out in polystyrene microtiter plates using crystal violet staining and optical density (OD; 580 nm) measurements. Since the individual effects of pH and aw on biofilm formation had a similar pattern to that observed for microbial growth <b>rate,</b> <b>cardinal</b> parameter models (CPMs) were used to describe these effects. CPMs described successfully {{the effects of these}} two environmental parameters, with the estimated cardinal values of pHmin, pHopt, pHmax, awmin and awopt being 3. 58, 6. 02, 9. 71, 0. 894 and 0. 994, respectively. The CPMs assumption of the multiplicative inhibitory effect of environmental factors was validated in the case of biofilm formation using additional independent data (i. e. 430 OD data at 86 different combinations of pH and aw). The validation results showed a good agreement (r 2 ¼ 0. 938) between observed and predicted OD with no systematic error. In the second part of this study, a probabilistic model predicting the pathogen's biofilm formation boundaries was developed, and the degree of agreement between predicted probabilities and observations was as high as 99. 8 %. Hence, the effect of environmental parameters on biofilm formation can be quantitatively expressed using mathematical models, with the latter models, in turn, providing useful information for biofilm control in food industry environments...|$|R
40|$|A {{wide range}} of species can be sown as cover crops during fallow periods to provide vari- ous {{ecosystem}} services. Plant establishment is a key stage, especially when sowing occurs in summer with high soil temperatures and low water availability. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the response of germination to temperature and water potential for diverse cover crop species. Based on these characteristics, we developed contrasting functional groups that group species with the same germination ability, which may be useful to adapt species choice to climatic sowing conditions. Germination of 36 different species from six botanical families was measured in the laboratory at eight temperatures ranging from 4. 5 – 43 °C and at four water potentials. Final germination percentages, germination <b>rate,</b> <b>cardinal</b> temperatures, base temperature and base water potential were calculated for each species. Optimal temperatures varied from 21. 3 – 37. 2 °C, maximum temperatures at which the spe- cies could germinate varied from 27. 7 – 43. 0 °C and base water potentials varied from - 0. 1 to - 2. 6 MPa. Most cover crops were adapted to summer sowing with a relatively high mean optimal temperature for germination, but some Fabaceae species were more sensitive to high temperatures. Species mainly from Poaceae and Brassicaceae were the most resistant to water deficit and germinated under a low base water potential. Species were classified, independent of family, according to their ability to germinate under a range of temperatures and according to their base water potential in order to group species by func- tional germination groups. These groups may help in choosing the most adapted cover crop species to sow based on climatic conditions in order to favor plant establishment and the services provided by cover crops during fallow periods. Our data can also be useful as ger- mination parameters in crop models to simulate the emergence of cover crops under differ- ent pedoclimatic conditions and crop management practices...|$|R
