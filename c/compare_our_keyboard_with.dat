40|$|Effective {{text entry}} on {{handheld}} devices remains {{a significant problem}} {{in the field of}} mobile computing. On a personal digital assistant (PDA), text entry methods traditionally support input through the motion of a stylus held in the user's dominant hand. In this paper, we present the design of a two-handed software keyboard for a PDA which specifically takes advantage of the thumb in the non-dominant hand. We <b>compare</b> <b>our</b> chorded <b>keyboard</b> design to other stylus-based text entry methods in an evaluation that studies user input in both stationary and mobile settings. Our study shows that users type fastest using the miniqwerty keyboard, and most accurately using <b>our</b> two-handed <b>keyboard.</b> We also discovered a difference in input performance <b>with</b> the mini-qwerty <b>keyboard</b> between stationary and mobile settings. As a user walks, text input speed decreases while error rates and mental workload increases; however, these metrics remain relatively stable in our two-handed technique despite user mobility...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{whether and how}} domain-specific corpora increase precision of word disambiguation for typing on an ambiguous keyboard. Basically, the disambiguation for <b>our</b> ambiguous <b>keyboard</b> <b>with</b> three letter keys is based on language-specific word frequencies of the lexicon CELEX (in this study English and German is dealt with). The more specific frequency information is extracted from texts in the special domains of school homework in three subjects and articles in two different scientific areas. All in all, we could not always reach a better performance by deploying domain [...] specific predictions. As a general solution we propose an interpolated language model combining both the general and the specific language model. For all our domains good results [...] compared to an ideal prediction {{on the basis of}} all available models [...] could be achieved by this method...|$|R

Addressing this untapped potential, we follow an ap-proach that is based on gestural interaction with smart furniture interfaces, subtly blended into the work envi-ronment. Adding to existing work on peripheral interac-tion, we provide a case study of a novel input technique that turns a flexible chair into a ubiquitous input device within an office environment. We propose using impre-cise semaphoric chair gestures to support always-available, hands-free, and eyes-free interaction...|$|R
40|$|During {{everyday}} {{office work}} {{we are used}} to controlling <b>our</b> computers <b>with</b> <b>keyboard</b> and mouse, while the majority of our body remains unchallenged and the physical workspace around us stays largely unattended. Addressing this untap-ped potential, we explore the concept of turning a flexible office chair into a ubiquitous input device. To facilitate daily desktop work, we propose the utilization of semaphor-ic chair gestures that can be assigned to specific application functionalities. The exploration of two usage scenarios in the context of focused and peripheral interaction demon-strates high potential of chair gestures as additional input modality for opportunistic, hands-free interaction...|$|R

This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} evaluation of an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) System for the European Portuguese. The system works {{on top of the}} Windows operating system and it can interact with any application that requires keyboard input. The system is targeted to motor impaired users and offers two rate enhancement techniques: word prediction and abbreviation expansion. People with difficulties using a computer <b>keyboard</b> can use <b>our</b> system’s on-screen <b>keyboard</b> <b>with</b> different access methods. Aiming at reinforcing the user’s interaction, our system also includes an interface agent and a speech synthesizer. Each component of the system can be configured to the specific requirements of each user. Tests were carried out qualitatively, evaluating the performance with real users, and quantitatively, by using a simulator included in our system. These tests showed that our system can save up to 50 % of user typing effort...|$|R
40|$|We {{detect and}} correct typing errors made on mini–QWERTY {{keyboards}} by analyzing {{features of the}} typing itself. Examining a database of mini–QWERTY typing data reveals that many errors made by typists are “off–by–one ” errors. One likely cause of these errors is the relative size difference between the user’s thumb and the small, densely packed keys of the mini–QWERTY <b>keyboard.</b> <b>Our</b> goal <b>with</b> this work is to improve expert typing speeds and accuracy by automatically correcting the user’s typing errors before they are displayed on the screen. Using pattern recognition methods, we {{reduced the number of}} off–by–one errors by 39. 78 % and the total errors by 26. 41 %. This paper discusses the problem, the features used to detect errors, the techniques used to train the system, and future steps to generalize the algorithm for other keyboards and situations...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} text entry on {{smartphones}} and other touch-screen devices is key for many tasks and also {{a key factor in}} the usability of these devices. Physical and cognitive issues associated with age can aggravate the task of text entry for older adults. Technological exclusion due to low usability can present a significant problem both for social and ongoing business-related tasks with older adults. This paper investigates a new touch-screen keyboard design for older adults that combines the familiar QWERTY <b>keyboard</b> layout <b>with</b> physical gesture. User studies with older adults showed <b>our</b> <b>keyboard</b> reduced miss-taps, but was slower to use, and raised issues for further research.

We {{explain how the}} additional functionality can be obtained {{at a lower cost}} than existing keyboard controllers and demonstrate a prototype to illustrate this analysis. <b>Our</b> new <b>keyboard</b> uses optical interruption sensing for each key and hybrid space and time multiplexing to achieve the requisite scan rates. Scanned data is assembled into packets using a single FPGA and formatted for a variety of readily available communication methods including embedded in SPDIF and ADAT audio streams and as Ethernet UDP packets. 1...|$|R
