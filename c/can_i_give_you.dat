6000|$|... "One {{is bound}} to be very careful. How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> to a man I know nothing about,--an adventurer? What would they say in Herefordshire?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> {{the key of}} {{the back}} door?" [...] she said, equally quietly; [...] "you know father always carries it in his coat pocket." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Colonel Gerard," [...] said he, [...] "I cannot {{promise you}} your life, {{for it is}} not our custom, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> an easy death or <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a terrible one. Which shall it be?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} will like this room," [...] he said a little anxiously. [...] "It is the best that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> to-night.

6000|$|Con. Gone, gone, {{now lost}} to me forever! Remember thee! Ah, how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> ever banish thy dear image from this heart that now hath grown so desolate? I will be true.

Yes, Irene, I will strive to love thee, and may the gods give me strength; but Ione, Ione, how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>thee</b> up!

6000|$|... "Throw {{your coat}} down anywhere, Miss Baldwin," [...] Wingate invited, as he ushered that young lady into his rooms soon after eleven o'clock on the {{following}} evening. [...] "Now what <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you?</b> There are some sandwiches here--ham and pâté-de-foie-gras, I think. Whisky and soda or some hock?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{tell you}} so. You {{may not come}} again,--not in this way. Do you {{remember}} what I told you before, in the garden; that I loved him better than all the world besides?

6000|$|... "Welcome, welcome, my dear John; this is {{very kind}} of you to come to visit your recluse sister. I have been trying to nail my eyes and my {{understanding}} to a stupid book here, because they say too much thought is not quite good for me. But, either the man's dulness, or my want of the power of attending, makes my eyes pass over the page, just as one seems to read in a dream, without being able to comprehend one word of the matter. You shall talk to me, and that will do better. What <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> to show that you are welcome? I am afraid tea is all I have to offer, and that you set too little store by." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said I, [...] "frankly then, {{and upon}} my honour too, I believe it is. It {{has been set}} up only four years, it is true; but Mr. Brough had a great name when it was established, and a vast connection. Every clerk in the office has, to be sure, in a manner, paid for his place, either by taking shares himself, or by his {{relations}} taking them. I got mine because my mother, who is very poor, devoted a small sum of money that came to us to the purchase of an annuity for herself and a provision for me. The matter was debated by the family and our attorneys, Messrs. Hodge and Smithers, who are very well known in our part of the country; and it was agreed on all hands that my mother could not do better with her money for all of us than invest it in this way. Brough alone is worth half a million of money, and his name is a host in itself. Nay, more: I wrote the other day to an aunt of mine, who has a considerable sum of money in loose cash, and who had consulted me as to the disposal of it, to invest it in our office. <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> any better proof of my opinion of its solvency?" ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{opening line}} of the song was also parodied in the movie Young Frankenstein.

5000|$|There is {{no fault}} I find in you. One {{of them is}} indecisive, so I gave him a sword to {{encourage}} him to be more decisive.

5000|$|As the {{students}} gather after class, Miss Jenny announces {{that she has}} not prepared any entertainment for their session, but hopes that someone else will follow Miss Dolly's example and provide some material for them to think about. Miss Sukey says {{that she has a}} letter from her cousin and would like to share it with the group as she found it both 'strange and remarkable.' Upon the completion of Miss Sukey's reading, Miss Patty Lockit exclaims, [...] "What Thanks <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>you,</b> my dear Friend, for having put me into a Way of examining my heart, and reflecting on my own Action; by which you have saved me, perhaps, from a Life as miserable as that of the poor Woman in Miss Sukey's Letter!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, <b>I</b> <b>can!</b> <b>I</b> might <b>give</b> <b>you</b> {{in charge}} for some crime or other; and {{in lack of}} evidence, the {{expenditure}} of a few dollars would, I have no doubt, be sufficient to induce the judge, magistrate, or whatever they call him, to <b>give</b> <b>you</b> six months' imprisonment." ...|$|R
