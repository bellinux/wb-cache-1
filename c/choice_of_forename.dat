40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{forenames}} in Cameroon English speech. It examines {{the structure of}} people’s names, the sources and uses <b>of</b> <b>forenames,</b> the formation <b>of</b> pet-names, the orthographic representations <b>of</b> <b>forenames</b> and their phonological realisations. The graphic data come from the birth certificates of thousands of undergraduate students aged seventeen and above, and the phonic data are tape-recordings of GCE examinations results read over the Cameroon broadcasting corporation networks (CRTV). The analysis of the graphic data shows that some forenames were recorded inaccurately by semi-literate civil status officers, who usually spelt names as they were pronounced by parents or by themselves. The analysis of the phonic data does not only replicate the various findings described in recent studies of Cameroon English phonology such as glide formation and vowel epenthesis. It also reveals {{the widespread use of}} tonal features in the realisations of pet-names in Cameroon English speech...|$|R

40|$|Generally {{surnames}} (family name) or forenames are {{evolved over}} generations {{which can be}} used to understand population origins, migration, identity, social norms and cultural customs. These forenames or surnames may have hidden structure associated with them called communities. Each community might have strong correlation among several forenames and surnames. In addition, the correlation might be across communities <b>of</b> <b>forenames</b> or surnames. Popular statistical generative model such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has been developed to find topics in a corpus of documents. However, the LDA model can be proposed to identify hidden communities in names data set. This paper proposes several variants of latent Dirichlet allocation models to capture correlation between surnames and forenames within the communities and across the communities over a set of names collected at different locations. Initially, we propose surname correlated LDA model and forename correlated LDA model. These models identify communities in surnames or forenames and extract corresponding correlated forenames or surnames in each community respectively. Later, we propose surname community correlated LDA model and forename community correlated LDA model. These models estimate correlation among each surname community to the communities <b>of</b> <b>forenames</b> and vice versa respectively. We experiment for India and United Kingdom names data sets and conclusions are drawn...|$|R
