6000|$|... 1. These {{are most}} {{important}} distinctions, upon which depends a right understanding of this doctrine. God sees the soul either in Christ or in sin. He may see apparently good works arising from the foulest motives. Uriah doubtless thought himself highly honoured as a <b>confidential</b> <b>messenger</b> of great king David; God saw the murder and adultery in David's heart. He was justified {{in the sight of}} man for the very act that condemned him in the sight of God; and for which he was sorely punished in this world, although saved by the blood of atonement.--Ed.|$|E
6000|$|The {{next morning}} Nyssia sent, {{by some of}} her <b>confidential</b> <b>messengers,</b> for Gyges to come to her. He came, with some forebodings, perhaps, but without any direct reason for believing that {{what he had done}} had been discovered. Nyssia, however, {{informed}} him that she knew all, and that either he or her husband must die. Gyges earnestly remonstrated against this decision, and supplicated forgiveness. He explained the circumstances under which the act had been performed, which seemed, at least so far as he was concerned, to palliate the deed. The queen was, however, fixed and decided. It was wholly inconsistent with her ideas of womanly delicacy that there should be two living men who had both been admitted to her bed-chamber. [...] "The king," [...] she said, [...] "by what he has done, has forfeited his claims to me and resigned me to you. If you will kill him, seize his kingdom, and make me your wife, all shall be well; otherwise you must prepare to die." ...|$|R
60|$|Tippoo {{was known}} to have sent <b>confidential</b> <b>messengers</b> to all the great princes of India--even to the ruler of Afghanistan--inviting them to join the confederacy of the Mahrattis, the Nizam, and himself, to drive the English out of India altogether. Still greater cause for uneasiness was the {{alliance}} that Tippoo had endeavoured to make with the French, who, as he had learned, had gained great successes in Europe; and, believing from their account that their country was much stronger than England, he had sent envoys to the Mauritius, to propose an offensive and defensive alliance against England. The envoys had been politely received, {{and some of them}} had proceeded to France, where Tippoo's proposal had been accepted. They committed France, indeed, to nothing, as she was already at war with England; but the French were extremely glad to embrace the proposal of Tippoo, as they overrated his power, and believed that he would prove a formidable opponent to the English, and would necessitate the employment of additional troops and ships there, and so weaken England's power at home. To confirm the alliance, some sixty or seventy Frenchmen, mostly adventurers, were sent from the Mauritius as civil and military officers.|$|R
25|$|Serving {{with the}} National Pigeon Service (NPS) during the Second World War, Commando {{had been given}} the {{identification}} code N.U.R.P.38.EGU.242. During his career, Commando made more than ninety trips into and out of German occupied France, carrying <b>confidential</b> messages. <b>Messenger</b> pigeons were carried into the war zones by British paratroopers, and released as needed with messages attached to fly home. He was noted for three particular missions carried out in 1942—one in June, another in August, and the third in September—in which he carried crucial intelligence to Britain from agents in France. This vital information included the location of German troops, industrial sites and injured British soldiers.|$|R
60|$|Captain Rawdon got an {{extension}} of leave on his aunt's illness, and remained dutifully at home. He was always in her antechamber. (She lay sick in the state bedroom, into which you entered by the little blue saloon.) His father was always meeting him there; or if he came down the corridor ever so quietly, his father's door was sure to open, and the hyena face of the old gentleman to glare out. What was it set one to watch the other so? A generous rivalry, no doubt, as to which should be most attentive to the dear sufferer in the state bedroom. Rebecca used {{to come out and}} comfort both of them; or {{one or the other of}} them rather. Both of these worthy gentlemen were most anxious to have news of the invalid from her little <b>confidential</b> <b>messenger.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{the world}} knows, lad, that George, Earl of March and Dunbar, was mightily {{offended}} at Rothesay breaking off the match with his daughter, and marrying {{the child of}} his rival Douglas; but now I am {{going to tell you}} what the world does not know, and which is a secret that would cost many a life, were it to be blabbed abroad, and which I should not tell you, had I not a perfect confidence in your discretion. The anger of March--as he is mostly called on this side of the border, while in Scotland they more often call him Earl of Dunbar--goes beyond mere displeasure with the Douglas, and sullen resentment against Rothesay. He has sent a <b>confidential</b> <b>messenger</b> to me, intimating that he is ready to acknowledge our king as his sovereign, and place himself and his forces at his disposal.|$|E
6000|$|The {{disaster}} of October 1st--for {{which they were}} trying to sing TE-DEUMS at Vienna--fell heavier on the poor Saxons, in their cage at Pirna: [...] "Alas, where is our deliverance now?" [...] Friedrich's people, in their lines here, gave them such a [...] "joy-firing" [...] for Lobositz as Retzow has seldom heard; huge volleyings, salvoings, running-fires, starting out, artistically timed and stationed, thunderous, high; and borne by the echoes, gloomily reverberative, into every dell and labyrinth of the Pirna Country;--intended to strike a deeper damp into them, thinks he. [Retzow, i. 67.] But Imperial Majesty was mindful, too; and straightway sent Browne positive order, [...] "Deliver me these poor Saxons at any price!" [...] And in the course of not quite a week from Lobositz, there arrives a <b>confidential</b> <b>Messenger</b> from Browne: [...] "Courage still, ye caged Saxons; I will try it another way! Only you must hold out till the 11th; on the 11th stand to your tools, and it shall be done." ...|$|E

Go, generous young man," [...] Cora continued, lowering her eyes under {{the gaze of the}} Mohican, and, perhaps, with an intuitive consciousness of her power; [...] "go to my father, as I have said, and be the most <b>confidential</b> of my <b>messengers.</b> Tell him to trust you with the means to buy the freedom of his daughters. Go! 'tis my wish, 'tis my prayer, that you will go!" ...|$|R
6000|$|As Mr. Beckendorff quitted the room, his <b>confidential</b> servant, the <b>messenger</b> of Turriparva, entered, {{and with}} the most respectful bow {{informed}} Vivian that the horses were ready. In about three hours' time Vivian Grey, followed by the Government messenger, stopped at his hotel. The landlord and waiters bowed with increased obsequiousness on seeing him so attended, {{and in a few}} minutes Reisenburg was ringing with the news that his appointment to the Under-Secretaryship of State was now [...] "a settled thing." ...|$|R
60|$|At length, however, in {{the year}} 1586, about {{eighteen}} years from the commencement of Mary's captivity, a plot was formed in which she became so seriously involved as to subject herself {{to the charge of}} aiding and abetting in the high treason of which the leaders of the plot were proved to be guilty. This plot is known in history by the name of Babington's conspiracy. Babington was a young gentleman of fortune, who lived in the heart of England. He was inspired with a strong degree of interest in Mary's fate, and wished to rescue her from her captivity. He joined himself with a large party of influential individuals of the Catholic faith. The conspirators opened negotiations with the courts of France and Spain for aid. They planned an insurrection, the assassination of Elizabeth, the rescue of Mary, and a general revolution. They maintained a correspondence with Mary. This correspondence was managed very secretly, the letters being placed by a <b>confidential</b> <b>messenger</b> in a certain hole in the castle wall where Queen Mary was confined.|$|E
60|$|Thus, {{far from}} being transported by any sudden and violent feeling of resentment to an inconsiderate act of revenge, Astyages began, calmly and coolly, and with a {{deliberate}} malignity more worthy of a demon than of a man, to consider how he could best accomplish the purpose he had in view. When, at length, his plan was formed, he sent for Harpagus to come to him. Harpagus came. The king began the conversation by asking Harpagus what method he had employed for destroying the child of Mandane, which he, the king, had delivered to him some years before. Harpagus replied by stating the exact truth. He said that, {{as soon as he}} had received the infant, he began immediately to consider by what means he could effect its destruction without involving himself in the guilt of murder; that, finally, he had determined upon employing the herdsman Mitridates to expose it in the forest till it should perish of hunger and cold; and, in order {{to be sure that the}} king's behest was fully obeyed, he charged the herdsman, he said, to keep strict watch near the child till it was dead, and then to bring home the body. He had then sent a <b>confidential</b> <b>messenger</b> from his own household to see the body and provide for its interment. He solemnly assured the king, in conclusion, that this was the real truth, and that the child was actually destroyed in the manner he had described.|$|E
6000|$|As soon as {{by reading}} it I was assured of {{the arrival of}} the [...] saints, I {{despatched}} a <b>confidential</b> <b>messenger</b> to Maestricht [...] to gather together priests, other clerics, and also laymen, [...] to go out to meet the coming saints as speedily as possible. [...] And he and his companions, having lost no time, after a few [...] days met those who had charge of the saints at Solothurn. [...] Joined with them, and with a vast crowd of people who [...] gathered from all parts, singing hymns, and amidst great and [...] universal rejoicings, they travelled quickly to the city of [...] Argentoratum, which is now called Strasburg. Thence [...] embarking on the Rhine, they came to the place called [...] Portus,[37] and landing on the east bank of the river, at [...] the fifth station thence they arrived at Michilinstadt,[38] [...] accompanied by an immense multitude, praising God. This [...] place is in that forest of Germany which in modern times is [...] called the Odenwald, and about six leagues from the Maine. [...] And here, having found a basilica recently built by me, but [...] not yet consecrated, they carried the sacred remains into it [...] and deposited them therein, as if it were to be their final [...] resting-place. As soon as all this was reported to me I [...] travelled thither as quickly as I could. (Cap. ii. 14.) ...|$|E
60|$|Besides all this, Pierre {{considered}} the history, and, so to speak, the family {{legend of the}} smaller painting. In his fifteenth year, it was made a present to him by an old maiden aunt, who resided in the city, and who cherished the memory of Pierre's father, with all that wonderful amaranthine devotion which an advanced maiden sister ever feels {{for the idea of}} a beloved younger brother, now dead and irrevocably gone. As the only child of that brother, Pierre was an object of the warmest and most extravagant attachment on the part of this lonely aunt, who seemed to see, transformed into youth once again, the likeness, and very soul of her brother, in the fair, inheriting brow of Pierre. Though the portrait we speak of was inordinately prized by her, yet at length the strict canon of her romantic and imaginative love asserted the portrait to be Pierre's--for Pierre was not only his father's only child, but his namesake--so soon as Pierre should be old enough to value aright so holy and inestimable a treasure. She had accordingly sent it to him, trebly boxed, and finally covered with a water-proof cloth; and it was delivered at Saddle Meadows, by an express, <b>confidential</b> <b>messenger,</b> an old gentleman of leisure, once her forlorn, because rejected gallant, but now her contented, and chatty neighbor. Henceforth, before a gold-framed and gold-lidded ivory miniature,--a fraternal gift--aunt Dorothea now offered up her morning and her evening rites, to the memory of the noblest and handsomest of brothers. Yet an annual visit to the far closet of Pierre--no slight undertaking now for one so stricken in years, and every way infirm--attested the earnestness of that strong sense of duty, that painful renunciation of self, which had induced her voluntarily to part with the precious memorial.|$|E
6000|$|That Cicero doubted much {{whether he}} would or would not at this time throw in his lot with Cæsar and Pompey is certain. To be of real use--not to be impractical, as was Cato--to save his country and rise {{honestly}} in power and glory--not to be too straitlaced, not over-scrupulous--giving and taking a little, {{so that he might}} work to good purpose with others in harness--that was his idea of duty as a Roman. To serve in accord with Pompey was the first dream of his political life, and now Pompey was in accord with Cæsar. It was natural that he should doubt--natural that he should express his doubts. Who should receive them but Atticus, that [...] "alter ego?" [...] Cicero doubted whether he should cling to Pompey--as he did in every phase of his political life, till Pompey had perished {{at the mouth of the}} Nile. But at last he saw his way clear to honesty, as I think he always did. He tells his friend that Cæsar had sent his <b>confidential</b> <b>messenger,</b> Balbus, to sound him. The present question is whether he shall resist a certain agrarian law of which he does not approve, but which is supported by both Pompey and Cæsar, or retire from the contest and enjoy himself at his country villas, or boldly stay at Rome and oppose the law. Cæsar assures him that if he will come over to them, Cæsar will be always true to him and Pompey, and will do his best to bring Crassus into the same frame of mind. Then he reckons up all the good things which would accrue to him: [...] "Closest friendship with Pompey--with Cæsar also, should he wish it; the making up of all quarrels with his enemies; popularity with the people; ease for his old age, which was coming on him. But that conclusion moves me to which I came in my third book."[238] Then he repeats the lines given in the note below, which he had written, probably this very year, in a poem composed in honor of his own Consulship. The lines are not in themselves grand, but the spirit of them is magnificent: [...] "Stick to the good cause which in your early youth you chose for yourself, and be true to the party you have made your own." [...] "Should I doubt when the muse herself has so written," [...] he says, alluding to the name of Calliope, given to this third book of his. Then he adds a line of Homer, very excellent for the occasion:[239] [...] "No augury for the future can be better for you than that which bids you serve your country." [...] "But," [...] he says, [...] "we will talk of all that when you come to me for the holidays. Your bath shall be ready for you: your sister and mother shall be of the party." [...] And so the doubts are settled.|$|E

The Japanese officers were a highly educated, very intelligent set of men, the most striking feature of whom was their never changing courtesy in all their arduous work. Every common soldier in that army was a gentleman, and their officers were paragons of fine manners under the most trying circumstances. When they were asked whether they believed it possible to take Port Arthur they smiled confidently, but never uttered a boasting word, never. All they said was : "The Emperor has commanded us to take Port Arthur, and we must obey. "Original format: 1 photomechanical print on stereo card : halftone, stereograph, color; 9 x 18 c...|$|E
