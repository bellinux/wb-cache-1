5|$|Designed {{for future}} {{expansion}} to accommodate additional aircraft, {{there has been}} talk of a terminal expansion, though official plans {{have yet to be}} announced. However, with the gate space being used to 100 percent capacity at peak times, there is very little <b>capacity</b> <b>available</b> for new flights unless they arrive and depart at off-peak times (10 AM-12 PM),(7 PM-10 PM).|$|E
5|$|The {{second source}} of over-provisioning {{comes from the}} manufacturer, {{typically}} at 0%, 7% or 28%, based on {{the difference between the}} decimal gigabyte of the physical capacity and the decimal gigabyte of the available space to the user. As an example, a manufacturer might publish a specification for their SSD at 100, 120 or 128GB based on 128GB of possible capacity. This difference is 28%, 7% and 0% respectively and is the basis for the manufacturer claiming they have 28% of over-provisioning on their drive. This does not count the additional 7.37% of <b>capacity</b> <b>available</b> from the difference between the decimal and binary gigabyte.|$|E
5|$|Bayan, {{named after}} the bard Boyan, had to be ordered in May 1898 from the French {{shipyard}} Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée in La Seyne-sur-Mer {{because there was no}} <b>capacity</b> <b>available</b> in Russian shipyards. The ship was laid down in February 1899 and launched on 12 June 1900. Bayan was completed in February 1903 and, under the command of Captain 1st Rank Robert Wiren, made port visits in Greece, Italy and North Africa before sailing for Kronstadt. Arriving in April 1903, she was only there for several months before departing for Port Arthur on 7 August. Together with the French-built battleship , Bayan arrived on 2 December and they were both assigned to the First Pacific Squadron.|$|E

50|$|In mid-2000, Quantum {{released}} the LCT 15. It lowered the spindle speed to 4400 RPM, but still had 512 KB of cache and an ATA-5 interface. <b>Capacities</b> <b>available</b> were 7.5, 15, 20.4 and 30 GB {{with up to}} two platters.|$|R
5|$|Director {{and story}} writer Hironobu Sakaguchi, {{designer}} Hiromichi Tanaka, character designer Yoshitaka Amano, scenario writer Kenji Terada, and music composer Nobuo Uematsu {{returned from the}} two previous Final Fantasy games {{to contribute to the}} development of Final Fantasy III. As with the previous two installments of the series, Final Fantasy III was programmed for the Famicom by Nasir Gebelli. It was the last original Final Fantasy title on which Gebelli worked. Midway through the development of the game, Gebelli was forced to return to Sacramento, California from Japan due to an expired work visa. The rest of the development staff followed him to Sacramento with necessary materials and equipment and finished production of the game there. The completed game was one of the largest ever released for the Famicom, published on a 512KiB cartridge, the second-highest <b>capacity</b> <b>available</b> for the console. Like many console role-playing games of the era, Final Fantasy III is noted for its difficulty.|$|E
5|$|There {{were several}} {{reported}} attendance figures for Bound for Glory IV, {{with the initial}} attendance figure being 5,000 people before being retracted and updated {{to a total of}} 5,500 people by The Wrestling Observer Newsletter. This was lower than the maximum seating <b>capacity</b> <b>available</b> at the Sears Centre of between 11,000 and 11,800 people for festival style events. However, the Bound for Glory IV setup caused the event to only hold a maximum capacity of 8,000 people. Of the 5,500 that attended the show, only 4,500 of them were paid tickets. Despite this, it was seen as one of the largest paid crowds in the company's history {{and one of the most}} responsive crowds the company has had as well. The Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported that 35,000 people bought the event.|$|E
5|$|Small scale {{can be done}} on a local X-ray tube source, {{typically}} {{coupled with}} an image plate detector. These {{have the advantage of}} being (relatively) inexpensive and easy to maintain, and allow for quick screening and collection of samples. However, the wavelength light produced is limited by anode material, typically copper. Further, intensity is limited by the power applied and cooling <b>capacity</b> <b>available</b> to avoid melting the anode. In such systems, electrons are boiled off of a cathode and accelerated through a strong electric potential of ~50 kV; having reached a high speed, the electrons collide with a metal plate, emitting bremsstrahlung and some strong spectral lines corresponding to the excitation of inner-shell electrons of the metal. The most common metal used is copper, which can be kept cool easily, due to its high thermal conductivity, and which produces strong Kα and Kβ lines. The Kβ line is sometimes suppressed with a thin (~10 µm) nickel foil. The simplest and cheapest variety of sealed X-ray tube has a stationary anode (the Crookes tube) and run with ~2 kW of electron beam power. The more expensive variety has a rotating-anode type source that run with ~14 kW of e-beam power.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Electric {{vehicles}} (EVs) {{are becoming}} widely used for its {{low energy consumption}} and low pollution. An accurate estimation of <b>available</b> <b>capacity</b> for Li-ion batteries has an important utility significance to optimize its performance in the applications of EVs. The Peukert equation is applied to estimate the <b>available</b> <b>capacity</b> of batteries. However, {{the fact that the}} <b>available</b> <b>capacity</b> of Li-ion batteries is dependent on battery temperatures can result in errors while using the Peukert equation. To address this problem, this paper proposes an extended Peukert equation to include temperature effect. This method considers battery temperature as an input variable into the Peukert equation. Experiments based on Li-ion batteries are carried out under various current and temperatures. The comparison of the estimated and the actual <b>available</b> <b>capacity</b> indicates that the proposed algorithm can provide a reliable and accurate estimation of the <b>available</b> <b>capacity</b> for Li-ion batteries...|$|R

25|$|According to a 2007 {{study of}} {{wind in the}} United States, ten or more widely {{separated}} wind farms connected through the grid could be relied upon for from 33 to 47% of their average output (15–20% of nominal capacity) as reliable, baseload power, as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height. When calculating the generating <b>capacity</b> <b>available</b> to meet summer peak demand, ERCOT (manages Texas grid) counts wind generation at 8.7% of nameplate capacity.|$|E
25|$|On 27 November 2007 Cessna {{announced}} that the Cessna 162 would {{be made in the}} People's Republic of China by Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, which is a subsidiary of Aviation Industry Corporation of China, a Chinese government-owned consortium of aircraft manufacturers. By manufacturing the aircraft in China, Cessna reported that it saved US$71,000 in production costs per aircraft produced. A second reason cited for moving production to Shenyang Aircraft Corporation was that Cessna at that time had no plant <b>capacity</b> <b>available</b> in the USA.|$|E
25|$|The eighty gigabits {{per second}} of {{bandwidth}} each Ka band satellites offers is an improvement on the four to six {{gigabits per second}} <b>capacity</b> <b>available</b> from earlier interim satellites. The satellites bounce signals from a satellite dish on the premises to an earth station, known as a 'gateway'; the gateway is then connected to a POI via a fibre backhaul. The satellite design was 'not easy', because the required coverage is about 'five per cent of the world's land mass' containing 'at least 200,000 premises' spread across 'over 7,000 kilometres' of area between Cocos Islands and Norfolk Island.|$|E
50|$|The large {{difference}} between installed and <b>available</b> <b>capacity</b> stems from serious maintenance deficiencies which have led, for example, {{to just one}} quarter of hydroelectric <b>capacity</b> to be <b>available.</b> The repairs carried out in Varreux and Carrefour should allow for 15 MW of additional capacity.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contrasts}} expectations {{derived from}} the theoretical literature on emergence of new modes of governance with empirical evidence, using data from empirical research on the adoption of and adaptation to EU environmental legislation during the EU accession process. The theoretical literature suggests that the huge costs implied by the compliance with EU directives and the weak state <b>capacities</b> <b>available</b> in the accession countries would encourage {{the emergence of new}} modes of governance. Empirical evidence from Hungary, Poland and Romania, however, shows {{that this is not the}} case. Institutional legacies, the simultaneity of transition and accession, and the time pressure to transfer the demanding EU regulations partially explain this observation. Most importantly, this paper finds that cooperation is most likely in those cases where at least a certain level of <b>capacities</b> is <b>available</b> to authorities, enabling them to remain in charge of the policy process...|$|R
25|$|Where a vehicle, {{such as the}} M50 Ontos, used {{multiple}} barrels, spotting rifles {{were usually}} provided for each barrel so that each could be accurately boresighted to its own barrel. The Ontos used six barrels with four spotting rifles; two without, to avoid making an already tall vehicle even higher. This provision may have been over-generous, although it did also increase the magazine <b>capacity</b> <b>available</b> for repeated ranging shots. Many photographs of the Ontos in service in Vietnam show it with {{only two of the}} spotting rifles installed in their mounts. The Ontos also often only carried four or even two main gun tubes.|$|E
25|$|The {{excess power}} {{generation}} <b>capacity</b> <b>available</b> in India is nearly 500 billion units/year presently and another 75,000 MW conventional power generating capacity is in pipeline excluding the targeted 175,000 MW renewable power by 2022. The hydrogen fuel generated by 500 billion units of electricity can replace all diesel and petrol consumed by heavy and medium duty vehicles in India completely obviating {{the need of}} crude oil imports for internal consumption. Converting petrol/diesel driven road vehicles in to fuel cell electric vehicles on priority would save the huge import cost of crude oil and transform the stranded electricity infrastructure in to productive assets with major boost to the overall economic growth.|$|E
25|$|The {{progenitor}} for the ASh-73 was the M-70. It {{was tested}} in late 1938 {{and was a}} failure because of cracks in the master connecting rod and the geared centrifugal supercharger's impeller. The exhaust valves also burnt through. The M-71 of 1939 was the successor to the M-70 and it too was not a success. It used some components from the M-62 engine, but its development was slowed by the German attack on the Soviet Union in 1941. It passed its State acceptance tests {{in the autumn of}} 1942, but was not placed into production as there was not any production <b>capacity</b> <b>available,</b> although it was tested on a number of different prototypes during the war. The M-72 of early 1945 was a boosted version of the M-71 and was superseded by the ASh-73 before production could get underway.|$|E
