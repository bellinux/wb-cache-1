5|$|After {{an attempt}} on Paul Robinson's (Stefan Dennis) life, Mark is {{introduced}} {{as the lead}} detective in the case. When he received <b>conflicting</b> <b>information</b> from the suspects he interviews, Mark struggled to identify the culprit. McGregor told a writer from SX News that he enjoyed {{being involved in the}} storyline, as he had never had that much responsibility before. To prepare for the role, McGregor chose to research his character's job. Mark was described as being handsome, charming and a perfectionist. He was dedicated to his job as a police detective and often put his work ahead of everything else. As a consequence, Mark struggled to balance his work and personal lives. McGregor stated that he shared some similarities with Mark and he enjoyed getting into character.|$|E
5|$|When {{emergency}} services arrived, they were initially {{unable to provide}} assistance as the high temperatures of the molten steel prevented them from entering the area {{and they had to}} wait for the steel to cool. When they were eventually able to access the area, they discovered thirty-two workers had been killed by the spill. Six others in the room survived and were rushed to the hospital with severe burns. According to doctors, five workers were initially listed as being in a stable condition, with the others listed as critical. They were said to be of risk of contracting infections through their burns. However, an earlier statement on the website of the State Administration of Work Safety published <b>conflicting</b> <b>information,</b> saying that the thirty-two deceased represented everyone in the room at the time, and that only two people were injured - the operators of the ladle. The official Xinhua press agency also released a report stating that the ladle fell on workers below, but this was unclear as in to whether the workers were in fact crushed or whether this, too, conflicted with the other reports.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese force {{made contact}} with the outer {{positions}} of Maroubra Force, focusing upon the observation posts that had been laid down {{either side of the}} Eora Creek gorge. Along the Isurava ridgeline, these attacks were held off by the 39th. However, around Missima along the alternate route, which had been held by the 53rd, the Australian position was destroyed and the village taken, opening the route to the Australian rear. In response, the 53rd's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Ward, dispatched a company from Alola forward to Abuari, to shore up the position there. Potts also requested reinforcements {{in the form of the}} 2/27th Infantry Battalion, which was being held in reserve around Port Moresby. The request was denied, though, due to concerns about the position around Milne Bay. Although some measure of defence was mounted by the 53rd, which dispatched another company after the first failed to report in, the situation grew worse for the Australians. <b>Conflicting</b> <b>information</b> was sent back from the 53rd's forward positions, confusing Potts' headquarters and rendering co-ordinated action impossible. To make matters worse for them, the Japanese ambushed and killed several of the 53rd's senior officers, including Ward. As the 53rd's position disintegrated the Japanese also faltered, failing to exploit the opportunity to roll up the Australian position all the way to Alola. Horie's 2/144th was stalled into inaction by fatigue, and hesitation, caused by the defence previously mounted by the 53rd. The Japanese battalion commander was convinced that the route was more heavily defended than it actually was. While the Japanese failed to exploit the situation, the 2/16th was tasked with restoring the position around Abuari, reinforcing the 53rd as the Japanese began threatening the Eora Creek crossing.|$|E

50|$|A common way {{to achieve}} {{distributed}} serializability in a (distributed) system is by a distributed lock manager (DLM). DLMs, which communicate lock (non-materialized <b>conflict)</b> <b>information</b> in a distributed environment, typically suffer from computer and communication latency, which reduces {{the performance of the}} system. CO allows to achieve distributed serializability under very general conditions, without a distributed lock manager, exhibiting the benefits already explored above for multidatabase environments; in particular: reliability, high performance, scalability, possibility of using optimistic concurrency control when desired, no <b>conflict</b> <b>information</b> related communications over the network (which have incurred overhead and delays), and automatic distributed deadlock resolution.|$|R

50|$|Distributed {{serializability}} {{is achieved}} by implementing distributed versions of the known centralized techniques. Typically all such distributed versions require utilizing <b>conflict</b> <b>information</b> (either of materialized or non-materialized conflicts, or equivalently, transaction precedence or blocking information; conflict serializability is usually utilized) that is not generated locally, but rather in different processes, and remote locations. Thus information distribution is needed (e.g., precedence relations, lock information, timestamps, or tickets). When the distributed system is of a relatively small scale, and message delays across the system are small, the centralized concurrency control methods can be used unchanged, while certain processes or nodes in the system manage the related algorithms. However, in a large-scale system (e.g., Grid and Cloud), due to the distribution of such information, substantial performance penalty is typically incurred, even when distributed versions of the methods (Vs. centralized) are used, primarily due to computer and communication latency. Also, when such information is distributed, related techniques typically do not scale well. A well-known example with scalability problems is a distributed lock manager, which distributes lock (non-materialized <b>conflict)</b> <b>information</b> across the distributed system to implement locking techniques.|$|R

25|$|Different sources give <b>conflicting</b> <b>information</b> {{as to the}} {{physical}} appearance of cherubim. An early, traditional Jewish notion supposes that cherubim had youthful, human features (although some early midrashic literature conceives of the cherubim as non-corporeal). In the Book of Ezekiel and (at least some) Christian icons, the cherub is depicted as having a number of wing pairs, and four faces: that of a lion (representative of all wild animals), an ox (domestic animals), a human (humanity), and an eagle (birds). Their legs were straight, the soles of their feet like the hooves of a bull, gleaming like polished brass. In Western Christian tradition, cherubim have become associated with the putto and the Greco-Roman deity Cupid/Eros, resulting in the misconception that cherubim are small and plump winged boys.|$|E

After examining the causes and reasons for this optimism, we move to the analysis of the recent literature that considers the existence of limited confrontations that allow bargaining to resume.

40|$|Contemporary {{processors}} {{with wide}} parallelism and deep pipelines result in complex and intrinsically nonstructured interactions between di#erent architectural {{features of the}} processor, the compiler and the application, making it extremely di#cult to predict performance variations when changing di#erent processor features. Compiler-Architecture Co-Exploration is required to evaluate the e#ects of architectural changes (such as connectivity sharing) {{on the performance of}} the entire system. These architectural modifications require the specification of detailed resource <b>conflict</b> <b>information</b> (generally represented as Reservation Tables) to the compiler [...] a task traditionally done manually on a per-operation basis. However, for deep pipelines, with complex resource sharing, and large non-structured instruction sets, manual, per-operation specification is a very tedious and error prone task. Moreover, reflecting the changes to the architecture during exploration in the <b>conflict</b> <b>information</b> requires changes to many Reservation Tables. In this paper we present a technique for automatic generation of Reservation Tables, that is used to drive architectural exploration {{of a large number of}} designs. Since the designer is relieved from the burden of manual specification and updating, he can drive fast exploration iterations, and cover a large space of architectures. We briefly outline our automatic Reservation Tables generation approach, and present a set of exploration experiments on a large set of EPIC architectures, for varying connectivity sharing, number of functional units, multicycling units, with varied latency configurations. For each point in the architecture space we evaluate a set of benchmarks from scientific, multimedia and general purpose application domains. Our ex [...] ...|$|R
