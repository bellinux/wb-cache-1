5|$|FH {{is usually}} treated with statins. Statins act by {{inhibiting}} the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA-reductase) in the liver. In response, the liver produces more LDL receptors, which remove circulating LDL from the blood.

50|$|A {{link between}} {{cholesterol}} and cardiovascular disease, {{known as the}} lipid hypothesis, had already been suggested. Cholesterol is the main constituent of atheroma, the fatty lumps in the wall of arteries that occur in atherosclerosis and, when ruptured, cause {{the vast majority of}} heart attacks. Treatment consisted mainly of dietary measures, such as a low-fat diet, and poorly tolerated medicines, such as <b>clofibrate,</b> cholestyramine, and nicotinic acid.

5000|$|Serum albumins are {{important}} in regulating blood volume by maintaining the oncotic pressure (also known as colloid osmotic pressure) of the blood compartment. They also serve as carriers for molecules of low water solubility this way isolating their hydrophobic nature, including lipid-soluble hormones, bile salts, unconjugated bilirubin, free fatty acids (apoprotein), calcium, ions (transferrin), and some drugs like warfarin, phenobutazone, <b>clofibrate</b> & phenytoin.

50|$|Many other {{hormones and}} dietary factors also {{regulate}} VLDLR expression. Thyroid hormone positively regulates VLDLR expression in skeletal muscles of rats, {{but not in}} adipose or heart tissues. In rabbits, VLDLR expression in heart muscle is up-regulated by estrogen and down-regulated by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. In trophoblast-derived cell lines, up-regulated VLDLR expression occurs when cells are incubated with hypolipidemic agents such as insulin and <b>clofibrate.</b> In contrast, 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-bromo-cAMP) down-regulates VLDLR expression. Finally, VLDLR {{is affected by the}} presence of apoE and LDLR. The presence of apoE is required for VLDLR expression regulation, while the absence of LDLR alters the sterol-regulatory-element-1-like sequences of VLDLR to make them functional in only heart and skeletal muscle.|$|E

40|$|Background/Aims: High-fat (HF) diets cause glucose intolerance. Fibrates improve glucose tolerance. We {{have tried}} to obtain {{information}} on possible hepatic mechanisms contributing to this effect. Methods: Rats were fed a HF diet, isocaloric with the control diet, for 3 weeks without or with <b>clofibrate.</b> Several parameters related to liver glucose and glycogen metabolism were measured. Results: <b>Clofibrate</b> prevented the induction of glucose intolerance by 3 weeks HF feeding. Improved glucose tolerance by <b>clofibrate</b> was not due to increases in glucose phosphorylation or glycolysis in the liver, since both the HIT diet and <b>clofibrate</b> suppressed glucokinase and pyruvate kinase activities with no effect on glucose 6 -phosphatase. <b>Clofibrate</b> decreased glycogen storage in both control and HF rats. <b>Clofibrate,</b> with and without HF feeding, inhibited weight gain during the experimental period. Body temperature was significantly elevated by <b>clofibrate,</b> indicative of an increased basal metabolic rate. The capacity of liver mitochondria to oxidize long-chain fatty acids increased by <b>clofibrate</b> treatment. Mitochondria did not show uncoupling. Conclusions: <b>Clofibrate</b> does not improve glucose tolerance by improving hepatic glucose or glycogen metabolism. Peripheral glucose oxidation may be facilitated by increased energy dissipation.

40|$|Normal {{subjects}} and patients with antidiuretic hormone (ADH) deficiency were studied {{to determine the}} mechanism of the antidiuretic action of <b>clofibrate.</b> Before <b>clofibrate</b> treatment, the patients' ability to concentrate urine with a standardized dehydration procedure correlated {{with the amount of}} ADH which was excreted. During <b>clofibrate</b> administration all six patients with ADH deficiency developed an antidiuresis which was like that of ADH, since there was no change in sodium, potassium, total solute, or creatinine excretion. There was a correlation between the patients' ability to concentrate urine during dehydration and the subsequent response to <b>clofibrate,</b> and the excretion of ADH during dehydration correlated with the excretion of ADH on <b>clofibrate</b> therapy. Clofibrate-induced antidiuresis in these patients was partially overcome by ethanol and by water loading. <b>Clofibrate</b> interfered with the ability of patients and subjects to excrete a water load and prevented the water load from inhibiting ADH excretion in the normal subjects. These studies suggested that <b>clofibrate</b> was acting through endogenous ADH and this thesis was supported by the failure of <b>clofibrate</b> to produce an antidiuresis when injected into rats with total ADH deficiency (Brattleboro strain) although an antidiuresis was produced in water-loaded normal rats. When the drug was injected into Brattleboro rats with exogenous ADH, <b>clofibrate</b> either did not alter or it inhibited the action of the ADH. The data demonstrate that <b>clofibrate</b> has a significant ADH-like action. This action appears to be mediated through the release of endogenous ADH...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>clofibrate</b> on the hemodynamic and renal manifestations of {{increased}} saline intake were analyzed. Four groups of male Wistar rats were treated for five weeks: control, <b>clofibrate</b> (240 [*]mg/kg/day), salt (2 % via drinking water), and salt + <b>clofibrate.</b> Body weight, {{systolic blood pressure}} (SBP), and heart rate (HR) were recorded weekly. Finally, SBP, HR, and morphologic, metabolic, plasma, and renal variables were measured. Salt increased SBP, HR, urinary isoprostanes, NOx, ET, vasopressin and proteinuria and reduced plasma free T 4 (FT 4) and tissue FT 4 and FT 3 versus control rats. <b>Clofibrate</b> prevented the increase in SBP produced by salt administration, reduced the sodium balance, and further reduced plasma and tissue thyroid hormone levels. However, <b>clofibrate</b> did not modify the relative cardiac mass, NOx, urinary ET, and vasopressin of saline-loaded rats. In conclusion, chronic <b>clofibrate</b> administration prevented the blood pressure elevation of salt-loaded rats by decreasing sodium balance and reducing thyroid hormone levels...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Clofibrate</b> is a {{pharmacological}} agent, {{which affects}} the lipid metabolism. This compound could {{be involved in}} bilirubin accumulation and excretion process. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of oral <b>clofibrate</b> intake on total serum bilirubin (TSB) of neonates hospitalized at Khatam Hospital. Methods: This clinical trial was conducted on 73 neonates with hyperbilirubinemia. Samples were divided into <b>clofibrate</b> (n= 41) and control (n= 32) groups. In the <b>Clofibrate</b> group, samples were given a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg <b>clofibrate,</b> whereas the control group received distilled water in an equal amount and color as placebo. Birth weight, type of delivery, gender, age and primary TSB level were recorded prior to the intervention and TSB was measured 24, 48 and 72 hours after the intervention. Results: In this study,no significant difference was observed between the groups on {{the first and third}} day of intervention in terms of mean TSB in neonates. However, a significant reduction was found on the second day in mean TSB of neonates, who received <b>clofibrate</b> (P= 0. 04). Conclusion: According to the results of this study, application of <b>clofibrate</b> was associated with faster alleviation of mean TSB and shorter duration of hospital stay without major side effects. Therefore, it is recommended that <b>clofibrate</b> be only used for clinical management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: <b>Clofibrate,</b> an {{established}} PPARÎ± ligand, {{has recently been}} shown to have anticancer activity yet its mechanisms of action remain to be characterized. This study examined the effect of <b>clofibrate</b> on heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) gene expression in A 2780 (human ovarian cancer) and DU 145 (human prostate cancer) cells. Methods and Results: We demonstrate that <b>clofibrate</b> induces HO- 1 expression in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The induction of HO- 1 by <b>clofibrate</b> was detected at both mRNA and protein levels and the HO- 1 gene promoter activity was also dramatically induced by <b>clofibrate,</b> indicating that <b>clofibrate</b> up-regulates HO- 1 gene transcription. Surprisingly, the induction of HO- 1 by <b>clofibrate</b> was mediated by the Nrf 2 signaling pathway, not by the PPARÎ± pathway. This was primarily demonstrated by siRNA knockdown of Nrf 2 expression that significantly attenuated clofibrate-induced HO- 1 gene transcription, and siRNA knockdown of PPARÎ± that had no effect on clofibrate-induced HO- 1 promoter activity. Furthermore, deletion of the antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the HO- 1 gene promoter diminished clofibrate-induced HO- 1 transcription and deletion of the PPAR response elements (PPREs) had no such effect. Likewise, application of PPARÎ± antagonists had no effect on clofibrate-induced HO- 1 expression. Conclusion: <b>Clofibrate</b> induces HO- 1 gene expression in cancer cells through a PPARÎ±-independent mechanism and the Nrf 2 signaling pathway is indispensible for this induction...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of gemfibrozil as a hypolipidaemic agent was {{compared with that}} of <b>clofibrate</b> in a cohort of 80 subjects, half being treated with gemfibrozil and half with <b>clofibrate.</b> The majority of the subjects were either of the type IIa or IIb. Both drugs proved to be effective, though there were 13 non-responders in the <b>clofibrate</b> group, compared with 8 in the gemfibrozil group. The mean reduction in serum cholesterol induced by <b>clofibrate</b> was 23 % and by gemfibrozil 19 %. The corresponding falls in serum triglycerides were 36 % and 43 %. There were no serious side effects in either group. Analysed in this way, the relative efficiencies of gemfibrozil and <b>clofibrate</b> seem to be indistinguishable.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} the oxidation of branched-chain amino acids is increased in rats treated with <b>clofibrate</b> [Paul and Adibi (1980) J. Clin. Invest. 65, 1285 - 1293]. Two subsequent studies have reported contradictory results regarding the effect of <b>clofibrate</b> treatment on gene expression of branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) in rat liver. Furthermore, {{there has been no}} previous study of the effect of <b>clofibrate</b> treatment on gene expression of BCKDH kinase, which regulates the activity of BCKDH by phosphorylation. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate the above issues. <b>Clofibrate</b> treatment for 2 weeks resulted in (a) a 3 -fold increase in the flux through BCKDH in mitochondria isolated from rat liver, and (b) a modest but significant increase in the activity of BCKDH. However, <b>clofibrate</b> treatment had no significant effect on the mass of E 1 alpha, E 1 beta, and E 2 subunits of BCKDH or the abundance of mRNAs encoding these subunits. On the other hand, <b>clofibrate</b> treatment significantly reduced the activity, the protein mass and the mRNA levels of BCKDH kinase in the liver. In contrast to the results obtained in liver, <b>clofibrate</b> treatment had no significant effect on any of these parameters of BCKDH kinase in the skeletal muscle. In conclusion, our results show that <b>clofibrate</b> treatment increases the activity of BCKDH in the liver and the mechanism of this effect is the inhibition of gene expression of the BCKDH kinase...|$|E
