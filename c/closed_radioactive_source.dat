40|$|Applications of {{radiation}} in medicine {{is based on}} the radiation ability of destroing the tumor cells and creating the images of internal organs. This two features {{play an important role in}} the diagnosis and treatment of diseases by radiation. In medicine X-ray and radionuclides being sources of gamma rays as Tc 99 m, I 137, or Tl 201 are used for the diagnosis of diseases, as beta particles uses for the treatment of diseases. In nuclear medicine radioactive isotopes are built into pharmaceuticals and create radiopharmaceuticals. Radiopharmaceutical administered to patient gathers in examined organ and gives information on functional and anatomical status of the organ. Radiation workers prepare radiopharmaceuticals, transport it, implement, take diagnostic images and survey the therapy. Their radiological protection is very important. Efficient radiation protection can be achieved by factors of time (reduce the time spent <b>close</b> to <b>radioactive</b> <b>source</b> to minimum), distance (keep maximal distance to <b>radioactive</b> <b>source),</b> and shielding (sufficient amount of protective material placed between the source and body) concepts are the basis...|$|R
40|$|In {{this letter}} a new {{coherent}} gamma emission mechanism, called Super-Čerenkov radiation, is introduced. The SČR {{is expected to}} take place when the charged particle is moving in a medium with a phase velocity vxph satisfying the super-coherent condition: cos θSC = vxphvγph ≤ 1. The results on an experimental test of SČR in RICH detector are presented. PACS: 25. 40. -h, 25. 70. -z, 25. 75. -q, 13. 85. -t The electromagnetic Čerenkov radiation was first observed in the early 1900 ’s by the experiments developed by Marie and Pierre Curie when studying radioactivity emission. In essence the observed phenomenon consists from the very faint emission of a bluish-white light from transparent substances in the neihbourhood of strong <b>radioactive</b> <b>source.</b> The first deliberate attempt to understand the phenomenon was made by Mallet [1] in 1926. He observed that the light emitted by a variety of transparent bodies placed <b>close</b> to a <b>radioactive</b> <b>source</b> always had the same bluish-white quality, and that the spectrum was continuous, not possessing the line or band structure characteristic of fluorescence. Mallet could not offer an explanation for the nature of this phenomenon, but was the first to find that spectrum was continuous and extended to 3700 ˚A. He was the first to appreciate the generality of thi...|$|R

40|$|<b>Radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> {{are being}} {{incorporated}} into the world’s scrap metal supply. In order to prevent this unwanted radioactive material from entering metal processing sites, some facilities have voluntarily installed radiation monitoring devices {{at the entrance to}} their facilities (Figure 1). However, this monitoring does not guarantee that all <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> will be detected in scrap metal loads. Shielding of the sources by the metal scrap, location of the source within the scrap load and the location and sensitivity of the monitoring system will determine if the source is detected. To date, there have been 83 meltings of <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> in metal processing facilities (1), with site cleanups averaging $ 12 – 15 million (1). One facility, the site of a melted a radiation source, has incurred cleanup costs in excess of $ 26 million (1). The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in a cooperative partnership with the scrap metal industry, developed a CD ROM based training program to provide a protocol for response to facility radiation alarms (2). This training enables site workers to identify and properly manage <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> after they have been detected in the scrap metal supply. In order to prevent these sources from becoming uncontrolled, it is necessary to identify and manage these <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> before they get placed in the scrap metal supply. A CD ROM based training program entitled “Identifying <b>Radioactive</b> <b>Sources</b> at the Demolition Site ” is designed to address this problem and help the demolition industry secure radioactive gauges and devices at their point of installation...|$|R

This will be achieved through the permanent disposal of all disused sealed <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> (DSRS) in the three target Member States. 2. Project background and rationale Sealed <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> are widely used throughout the world for beneficial purposes, in industry, medicine and research. Regulatory and physical control of the majority of sealed <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> is ensured during manufacturing, distribution and regular use. However, the IAEA has recognised that when sources become disused, and especially where regulatory infrastructure is ineffective and/or financial resources are limited, there is the possibility that control over these sources will be lost. In other circumstances, repatriation of DSRS to countries manufacturing and supplying sealed <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> may not be possible, in which case interim or long-term storage of the DSRS is required. But in Member States without an adequate radioactive waste management infrastructure, the management of DSRS in storage may also be extremely weak. In order to overcome these difficulties and assist its Member States the IAEA supports various initiatives aimed at improving management an...|$|R
