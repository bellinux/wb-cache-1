Hot climates have a much higher ground or surface water temperature than in cold climates and therefore {{will not be able to}} achieve such efficiencies. Moreover, the ARI rating scheme for ground source heat pumps allows them to largely ignore required pump power in their ratings, making the achievable SEER values often practically lower than the highest efficiency air-source equipment—particularly for air cooling. There are a variety of technologies that will allow SEER and EER ratings to increase further in the near future. Some of these technologies include rotary <b>compressors,</b> <b>inverters,</b> DC brushless motors, variable-speed drives and integrated systems.|$|R

First, the reasons why the compressor vibrates are discussed, unbalanced forces of comprssor moving parts are the source of the vibration. The flexible parts in the vibration transmission route are also very critical, they are inner discharge tube, suspension springs, rubber grommets, and so on. When the natural frequencies of the system are similar to the source excitation frequencies, resonance will happen, vibrations will be very large. Second, one <b>inverter</b> <b>compressor</b> vibrations were tested, and the results show that the vibrations varied a lot in different speeds and directions. Then the reasons why the <b>inverter</b> <b>compressor</b> vibrations are very large in some speeds are analyzed in the third part. The natural frequencies of shell and grommets system and inner discharge tube were got by experiment or simulation. The results show that those natural frequencies are too close to the soure excitation frequencies in some speeds, that is the reason why the compressor vibrates so large. By the grommets and inner discharge tube redesigns, the natural frequecies are moved far away from excitation frequencies, the compressor vibrations are reduced. The methods suggested in this research are helpful in reducing <b>inverter</b> <b>compressor</b> vibrations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The heat {{generated}} at the motor and inverter inside the electric <b>compressor</b> of <b>inverter</b> built-in type is mainly cooled by refrigerant and generally, {{there is not}} a thermal problem. However, the close relation of heat transfer from the motor and inverter parts to the compression part affects on compressor efficiency. Also, according to the surrounding environment and system operation condition, the increased temperature of the motor and inverter can affect the power density of the motor system, and especially, the inverter may be prevented to operate by the temperature limits. In this study, we performed thermo-flow analysis of electric compressor motor system, and investigated the heat dissipation enhancement of the motor and inverter. The motor part in the operation region of the electric compressor was generally maintained at low temperature and the inverter part at high compressor speed was lower temperature than the temperature limit of 85 ℃. However, the case of the inverter at low speed harsh condition was in excess of 10 ℃. Therefore, in order to solve the thermal problem, the heat reduction technology of the motor and inverter is essential as well as the improvement of flow path i...|$|R

This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} operating a 4 K pulse tube cryocooler using an inverterdriven compressor. The cryocooler is a Cryomech model PT 410. By adjusting the power frequency of the <b>inverter</b> <b>compressor</b> from 46 to 70 Hz, the cryocooler can offer 22 W to 43 W at 45 K on the first stage and 0. 5 W to 1. 1 W at 4. 2 K on the 2 nd stage; for this range, the compressor input power changes from 5. 0 kW to 8. 6 kW. Dynamic operation of the 4 K pulse tube cryocooler has been successfully demonstrated using a liquid helium cryostat.

40|$|The {{integrated}} photovoltaic/thermal collector (PV/T) with solar assisted {{heat pump}} (SAHP) often operates under an undesigned condition.

We also consider why the system is unstable and propose the theory of SAHP system stability. Also, a preliminary performance analysis is made on SAHP system that is respectively influenced by an <b>inverter</b> <b>compressor</b> and EEV.

50|$|An {{inverter}} {{can be used}} {{to control}} the speed of the compressor motor to drive variable refrigerant flow in a refrigeration or air conditioning system to regulate system performance. Such installations are known as <b>inverter</b> <b>compressors.</b> Traditional methods of refrigeration regulation use single-speed compressors switched on and off periodically; inverter-equipped systems have a variable-frequency drive that control the speed of the motor and thus the compressor and cooling output. The variable-frequency AC from the inverter drives a brushless or induction motor, the speed of which is proportional to the frequency of the AC it is fed, so the compressor can be run at variable speeds—eliminating compressor stop-start cycles increases efficiency. A microcontroller typically monitors the temperature in the space to be cooled, and adjusts the speed of the compressor to maintain the desired temperature. The additional electronics and system hardware add cost to the equipment, but can result in substantial savings in operating costs.|$|R
40|$|The {{requirements}} for environmentally friendly refrigerants promote application of CO 2 and water as working fluids. However {{there are two}} problems related to that, namely high temperature limit for CO 2 in condenser due to the low critical temperature, and low temperature limit for water being the result of high triple point temperature. This can be avoided by application of the hybrid adsorption-compression system, where water is the working fluid in the adsorption high temperature cycle used to cool down the CO 2 compression cycle condenser. The adsorption process is powered with a low temperature renewable heat source as solar collectors or other waste heat source. The refrigeration system integrating adsorption and compression system has been designed and constructed in the Laboratory of Thermodynamics and Thermal Machine Measurements of Cracow University of Technology. The heat source for adsorption system consists of 16 tube tulbular collectors. The CO 2 compression low temperature cycle is based on two parallel <b>compressors</b> with frequency <b>inverter.</b> Energy efficiency and TEWI of this hybrid system is quite promising {{in comparison with the}} compression only systems...|$|R
40|$|Disponible au lien suivant : [URL] audienceA {{heat pump}} enables one to {{transfer}} heat from a heat source to {{a heat sink}} using mechanical work. In water heating systems, the heat sink is water and the heat source can be ambient or exhaust air, {{the ground in a}} closed water loop, groundwater in an open loop or any other medium in which heat can be recovered. In normal operating conditions, the produced thermal energy is at least two times higher than the mechanical work consumed. That is why heat pumping technology can be interesting compared to conventional boilers or electric heaters. This chapter deals with vapour-compression air-source heat pumps applied to water systems for space heating and domestic hot water production. First, the classic subcritical heat pump cycle is detailed in terms of processes by means of Mollier diagrams. Basic notions will be given concerning the efficiency of the cycle (coefficient of performance, exergetic efficiency) depending on different parameters such as temperature, high and low pressure, subcooling and superheating. This cycle is then compared to the transcritical cycle used with CO 2 for hot water production. The list of advantages (such as temperature glide at high pressure) and drawbacks (such as lower efficiency for low temperature water heating) of this cycle will tend to limit the use of the CO 2 transcritical cycle to DHW production. Secondly, some of the major improvements brought to the vapour compression cycle will be reported through works made by the research community on multi-stage and <b>inverter</b> <b>compressors,</b> expansion devices, such as ejectors and work recovery devices and the design or the specific use of heat exchangers. Multi-stage compressors enable one to achieve higher pressure ratios and to reduce the heat losses during the compression. Ejectors recover some kinetic energy of expansion and increase the suction pressure at the compressor. Work recovery devices produce some mechanical work that can be reused at compression to reduce the energy consumption. Other improvements are made using internal heat exchangers, desuperheaters for domestic hot water production, microchannels instead of regular tubes for refrigerant and a special fin design to enhance the convection heat transfer coefficient. Heat pumps can also satisfy simultaneous needs in heating and cooling to carry out energy savings. Finally, dealing with air-source heat pumps compels to examine two points: the frosting problems and the defrosting strategies. Frosting reduces the global performance by diminishing the air flow cross section area and by adding a thermal resistance between air and refrigerant. It appears when the ambient air temperature is low and grows faster when the air humidity is high. These conditions occur during winter, when the needs in space heating are high. So an efficient defrosting strategy becomes necessary to ensure the user a satisfactory winter seasonal performance. Conventional defrosting strategies such as hot-gas bypass, reversed-cycle, electric heating and other strategies more in a research phase using air recirculation or a two-phase thermosiphon are discussed in the final part of this chapter...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{with the}} unceasing human {{population}} growth and fast economic development, the global energy demand is also increasing unceasingly. Meanwhile, the increasing carbon dioxide emission has become a significant environmental problem. Building energy has now accounted for about 1 / 5 of the primary energy consumption all over the world. The number in China was 23. 39 % in 2009 {{and it is still}} growing fast. In particular, building sector has great potential of energy saving. With the development of renewable energy like solar energy and wind power, the energy structure in China can be more reasonable. What s more, part of the heating demand can be covered by heat pump whose efficiency is much higher than electric heating and gas heating. 	The conversion efficiency of a photovoltaic (PV) cell is greatly influenced by its temperature. According to experimental results, every 1 °C rise in cell temperature reduces the conversion efficiency by about 0. 4 % for multi-crystalline cells. Therefore, many researches have been done to decrease the PV panel temperature to increase the performance. Different types of PV/T collectors were developed to realize the comprehensive utilization of solar photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) energy. The main difference of these collectors is working media which can be air, water, refrigerant and heat pipe. 	When the air or the water was used as working media of PV/T collectors, it was usually heated to a high temperature for direct heating usage. This was actually on the opposite direction of conversion efficiency improvement. In this thesis, a PV panel was combined with a heat pump system. The refrigerant used in this work is propane (R 290) and it is an environmental friendly working fluid whose ODP and GWP is 0 and 3. The evaporator of the heat pump was fixed under the PV panel. This combination, which is called PV evaporator in the following, can improve the conversion efficiency by cooling the PV cells and absorb solar thermal energy to produce hot water with the help of heat pump at the same time. What s more, the temperature of refrigerant is constant and relatively low during evaporation, this is good for the performance of PV cells. Based on the concepts above, a test rig of PV/T heat pump system was designed and built. Experimental researches were taken under summer weather conditions of Trondheim. According to the experimental results, the conversion efficiency of the PV panel can reach 15. 5 % in the best case, it was increased by 6. 9 % compared with the nominal value. The efficiency was influenced by solar radiation, ambient temperature and angle of incidence. A higher ambient temperature leads to a lower efficiency. The influence of the solar irradiance is complicated, ordinarily, a higher solar radiation may cause a decline in efficiency. The PV evaporator can absorb heat both from solar radiation and environment, the heat-collecting efficiency ranged from 0. 45 to 0. 77 in the tests. The COP of the heat pump is greatly influenced by the condenser supply water temperature. COP decreases with the increasing condenser supply water temperature. Solar radiation and ambient temperature {{have a positive impact on}} COP. The average COP of the heat pump can reach 4. 3 when the water was heated from 14. 8 °C to 50. 6 °C. The fractional errors of the measured conversion efficiency, COP are 5 % and 5. 2 %. Simulation of the test rig was made by EES to study the performance of PV/T heat pump system at different places and climates. The effectiveness of the simulation was validated by comparing the simulated results and experimental results. Daily performance analysis on April 30 in Shanghai was done, and it indicated that a higher air temperature leads to a better comprehensive performance. Annual operation simulated results in Shanghai, Oslo, New Delhi were analyzed. Monthly average value of air temperature, solar radiation and wind speed was adopted as the rated condition for annual performance evaluation. The annual average COP in Shanghai, Oslo, New Delhi are 3. 5, 2. 8 and 4. 4, respectively. And the annual average conversion efficiency in Shanghai, Oslo, New Delhi are 16. 4 %, 17. 3 %, 15. 5 %. An air evaporator in parallel and an <b>inverter</b> <b>compressor</b> can be used to improve the performance in cold environment without sufficient sunlight...|$|R
