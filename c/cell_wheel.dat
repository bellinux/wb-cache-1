These include cell wheels {{of different sizes}} and lamellae spacing cast with different numbers, as well as deeper than normal lamellae, (suited to metering larger than normal seeds / fertilizer and other particles / sizes of samples) and distributor impellors of clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation. Such specialized units have been fabricated at additional cost rather than being cast routinely, for want of improved pattern making and casting ideas and procedures as developed recently under the Flexiseeder Project 7 by S&N International Ltd in association with SLU 8, BACD 9, The Casting Shop, Collins Patterns and Geoff Gray Ltd.

40|$|When {{studying}} terramechanics for wheeled vehicles it {{is important}} to understand the tyre-terrain interaction. However the tyre road interface is hidden from view by the terrain and tyre itself. This makes determining the interaction externally very difficult. Some progress has been made by embedding sensors in the terrain or the tyre carcass however these techniques only capture a very small number of points. The problem of measuring dynamic tyre deformation at the tyre road interface from inside the tyre has been tackled in previous papers, however in this paper we seek to extend these measurements to identify the impact that rolling tyres have on the terrain. This is accomplished by measuring the undeformed soil profile in front of a tyre, the carcass deformation inside the tyre and the deformed soil profile behind the tyre. Test data was captured with the so-called Tyre–Terrain Camera System (T 2 CAM) on the Terramechanics rig at Virginia Tech using prepared sandy loam as the deformed soil material. T 2 CAM consists of three calibrated stereo camera rigs, a six-component load <b>cell,</b> <b>wheel</b> angle sensor and wheel speed sensor. Computer vision techniques are used with the images to generate full three dimensional profiles of the two soil areas and the inside surface of the tyre as captured by the cameras. The testing aims to compare undeformed soil profile with the deformed soil profile with the added information about the contact patch area and wheel forces to quantify both the plastic and elastic soil deformation...|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} use of bio-materials for energy purposes is generating large amounts of ash. In most cases, e. g. during incineration of straw and grain, bottom ash contains small amounts of heavy metals, but significant amounts of the plant nutrients phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). Bottom ash also contains some micronutrients (e. g. copper and zinc) that are good for plants in small doses, together with generally small amounts of undesirable heavy metals, including cadmium. Biogas plants are becoming increasingly common in Sweden. They produce considerable amounts of digestate, a liquid fertiliser with a high content of nitrogen (N) comparable with that of pig slurry but lower contents of P and K. High quality biogas digestate may now be applied to arable land. This study investigated techniques and systems for blending and spreading liquid digestate with ash admixture. The physical and alkaline properties and solubility in water of some ash types were therefore studied at laboratory scale, as were the buffering properties of some digestates. The influence of ash admixture on digestate pH and ammonia emissions was also studied. At pilot scale, the properties of different ash/digestate mixtures were studied and a <b>cell</b> <b>wheel</b> for liquid manure was tested for adding the ash. Three types of ash (from oats, straw and wood pellets) and two types of digestate were studied. The ash produced so much dust that dust reduction measures and breathing masks proved necessary during handling. It also contained so much abrasive material {{that the risk of}} wear to pumps, pipes {{and other parts of the}} spreading equipment was rated high. It is therefore best if the ash can be added as late as possible to equipment for spreading on arable land, and also it can be prevented from passing through pumps and other moving parts. Only a minor proportion of the oat ash and straw ash was soluble in water. All three types of ash were alkaline and therefore increased the pH when mixed with water. However, the digestate had a high buffering capacity, so the overall effect on pH when moderate amounts of ash were included was slight. When oat ash was mixed into digestate, equilibrium concentrations of ammonia did not increase. There is thus no risk of increased ammonia emissions as long as the mixture does not contain more than 5 % ash. In fact, ammonia concentrations were lower when ash was added, possibly because of ammonia binding to some metal ions. In practice, the SNFS 1994 : 2 limit values for P and heavy metals mean that the test ash-digestate mixtures with 1 % by weight of ash can be applied to the same field at most twice in a three-year period. Mixtures with 3 % by weight of ash can be spread at most every third year and mixtures with 5 % by weight of ash at most every fifth year. Batch admixture of ash into liquid digestate is unsuitable, because the majority of the ash settles and forms sediment in the bottom of the tank, despite efficient stirring. For continuous dosage of finely pulverised ash into digestate, a <b>cell</b> <b>wheel</b> made for dosage of liquid manure can be used. However, for dosage into a flow under pressure a sluice is necessary to prevent digestate being pressed up into the ash container. Admixture of ash into solid digestate is another possible alternative, e. g. during movement of the solid fraction from a digestate separator to a store...|$|E

40|$|We {{experience}} a major paradigm change in mobile networks. The infrastructure of cellular networks becomes mobile {{as it is}} densified by using mobile and nomadic small cells to increase coverage and capacity. Furthermore, the innovative approaches such as green operation through sleep scheduling, user-controlled small cells, and end-to-end slicing will make the network highly dynamic. Mobile cells, while bringing many benefits, introduce many unconventional challenges that we present in this paper. We have to introduce novel techniques for adapting network functions, communication protocols and their parameters to network density. Especially when <b>cells</b> on <b>wheels</b> or wings are considered, static and man-made configurations will waste valuable resources such as spectrum or energy if density is not considered as an optimization parameter.

We evaluate nomadic cells in dynamic networks in a comprehensive way and illustrate the potential objectives we can achieve by adapting mobile networks to base station density.

40|$|Adult {{neurogenesis}} {{within the}} dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus {{can be increased}} by voluntary exercise but is suppressed under stress, such as with corticosterone (CORT). However, the effects of exercise and CORT on the cell proliferation of the other traditional neurogenic site, the subventricular zone (SVZ), have been reported with controversial results. In addition, the cotreatment effects of voluntary exercise and CORT have not been investigated. This study aims to determine whether CORT can suppress cell proliferation in the SVZ and whether this can be reversed by voluntary exercise. In the present study, the effect of chronic (4 weeks) CORT treatment and wheel running simultaneously on the SVZ cell proliferation of adult Sprague–Dawley rats was examined. The results showed that cell proliferation indicated by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was increased by voluntary wheel running, whereas it was decreased by CORT treatment within the SVZ of the rats without running. For the rats with both CORT treatment and wheel running, {{it was found that}} the number of BrdU-labeled cells was approximately at the same level as the vehicle control group. Furthermore, these proliferating cells expressed doublecortin (DCX), a migrating neuroblast marker. Wheel running increased the percentage of BrdU-labeled cells expressing DCX in the SVZ, whereas CORT treatment decreased this percentage. Thus, chronic injection of CORT can decrease the number of proliferating <b>cells,</b> while <b>wheel</b> running can reverse the decrease in cell proliferation within the SVZ to normal levels. In addition, CORT can suppress the cell differentiation within the SVZ, and this was alleviated by wheel running as indicated by the double labeling of BrdU and DCX.

40|$|Swedish {{agricultural}} soils {{are reported to}} receive an annual application of plant nutrients as fertilizer amounting to a value almost as large the total new-investment made during one year. Poor precision in nutrient supply results in yield decreases and environmental loading. The purpose of this work is to summarize the knowledge available today on factors that influence fertilizer distribution achieved by pneumatic fertilizer spreaders. The work is mainly concentrated on technical design parameters that influences the spreading uniformity parallel to and {{at right angles to}} the direction of travel. The average coefficient of variation for the evenness of spreading of today’s fertilizer spreaders is 25 % in the field. In practise, there is no significant difference between centrifugal spreaders and pneumatic spreaders. During the work of which this report accounts for, 87 Swedish and international references have been studied in order to find factors influencing the result of fertilizer spreading. Factors influencing the spreading result can be divided into: the fertilizer, the machine, the field the weather and the operator. The flow properties of the fertilizer and its tendency to deposit on working mechanism are affected by its physical properties. The particle size distribution influences length of throw, flow properties and tendency of separation. The durability of the fertilizer will affect the particle size distribution. Particle shape and surface texture affect the flow properties. Density influences throw properties. Hygroscopicity influences water uptake and thereby flow properties and tendency to deposit within the machine. Thixotropic fertilizers lead to hard deposits being placed on working mechanisms and transport ducts against which the fertilizer glides. The machine can be divided into fertilizer hopper, feeder mechanism, fan, piping, spreader boom and spreader mechanism. When filling a hopper separation generally occurs. Severe separation influences the resulting distribution. When emptying the hopper the slope of the floor will influence the amount of fertilizer remaining in the hopper. 60 — 65 ° slope of the bottom of the hopper will ensure complete emptying. Metering mechanisms can be divided into active and passive mechanisms. The function of passive mechanisms depend on the flow properties of the fertilizer. The studded roller is a semi-active metering mechanism. Cyclic variations in out-flow may occur in metering devices that measure out the fertilizer in portions, e. g. <b>cell</b> <b>wheels,</b> star wheels and augers. Shaking and slope of hopper influences the mass flow from passive metering mechanisms. The fan is used to transport the fertilizer within the machine. The flow of air can be used to reduce drift caused by wind if both the flow of fertilizer and the flow of air are directed downwards at the spreading mechanism. At high fertilizer application rates the fan-pipe system in modern fertilizer spreaders tend to overload, with pulsating flows as a result. These pulsating flows are reflected in a severe deterioration of the spreading uniformity. The piping functions as a way of transport of the fertilizer. Piping with a high coefficient of friction leads to a rapidly attained even radial distribution of granules in the pipe. Curves induces pressure losses and deteriorated radial distribution in the pipe. Bends immediately before the spreading mechanism should be avoided. Movements of the spreader boom influences the final result of fertilizer spreading. Boom movements occur {{largely as a result of}} the torque of the fertilizer vehicle along its respective longitudinal and vertical axles. The response of a boom suspension to the rolling motion of the vehicle to which it is attached should be such that the boom is insulated from the high frequency random rolling movements but is able to follow the low frequency undulations of the ground. An example of such a boom suspension is found in the literature. In the literature, spreader mechanisms are found in many different shapes. Significant for the majority of them is that their evenness of distribution is sensitive to the radial distribution of granules in the pipe immediately before entering the spreader mechanism. The evenness of distribution is also sensitive to the working height above the ground. The field will through its geometry (shape, slope and bumpiness) affect the working result in form of unevennesses in the spreading pattern, gaps and overlapping. Soil type variations and varying cultivation capacity demand variable application rates. The weather factors that mainly influence the spreading accuracy are wind speed, air temperature and relative humidity. The wind speed influences the length and direction of throw. Air temperature and moisture are together with the temperature of the fertilizer decisive for the water uptake of the fertilizer. Large water uptake will change the flow properties of the fertilizer in a negative direction. The operator is the overall regulator in the "granule spreading system". The operator adjusts and maintain the machine. It is the operator who choses driving technique and the way the work is done. A technically very good fertilizer spreader cannot compensate fully for a bad operator. The operator should have assistance in steering the tractor and information of and possibility to adjust the application rate. What requirements can be placed on the future fertilizer spreader? The requirements placed on the fertilizer spreader of the future involve large control ability, i. e. high spreading accuracy and possibility to continuously vary the application rate. Furthermore, some kind of control over the mass flow of fertilizer will be needed. This review of the literature is concluded with a presentation of a new type of fertilizer spreader. The concept gives precedence to low manufacturing cost, active metering mechanism, variable mass flow and even distribution of fertilizer to the spreader mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{networks}} have become ubiquitous {{in the current}} technological framework. Such {{networks have}} widespread applications in commercial, public safety and military domains. Systems utilizing these networks are deployed in scenarios influencing critical aspects of human lives, e. g. connecting first responders to command center in disasters, wildlife monitoring, vehicular communication, and health care systems. %Dynamicity of a communication network can be either due to network dynamics or input dynamics. Network dynamics means the topology of the network changes over time. In these networks, nodes and edges may come and go. Input dynamics refers to changes in load of the network. In this dissertation, we explore two significant aspects of dynamic networks. In {{the first part of}} the dissertation, we study coverage problem in dynamic networks such as public safety networks. Networking infrastructure can partially (or sometimes fully) breakdown during a catastrophe. At the same time, unusual peaks in traffic load could lead to much higher blocking probability or service interruptions for critical communication. Lack of adequate communication among emergency responders or public safety personnel could put many lives at risks. One possible solution to deal with such scenarios is through the use of mobile/portable infrastructures, commonly referred to as <b>Cells</b> on <b>Wheels</b> (COW) or <b>Cells</b> on Light Trucks (COLT). These mobile cells can effectively complement the existing undamaged infrastructure or enable a temporary emergency network by themselves. Given the limited capacity of each cell, variable and spatially non-uniform traffic across the disaster area can make a big impact on the network performance. Not only judicious deployment of the cells can help to meet the coverage and capacity demands across the area, but also intelligent relocation strategies can optimally match the network resources to potentially changing traffic demands. Assuming that each cell can autonomously change its location, in this dissertation, we investigate such opportunities and constraints. We propose strategies for autonomous relocation of the mobile resource to adapt network coverage and increase the supported user traffic. We demonstrate the performance improvement for several scenarios via simulations using our algorithms. In practical scenarios, typically there are some areas in the field where mobile base stations cannot move into. Structural obstacles, areas with outstanding water or other hazardous materials, or surfaces with debris are examples of prohibited areas that mobile cells are expected to avoid. Such prohibited areas introduce additional constraints on designing intelligent relocation strategies. We propose a decentralized relocation algorithm that enables mobile cells to adapt their positions in response to potentially changing traffic patterns in a field with such prohibited areas. In the second part of dissertation, we study routing problem in dynamic networks. Routing is critical when there is no direct link connecting source to its destination. Performance of this algorithm is critical in many different applications. Two important metrics in routing are delay and throughput. We propose a throughput-optimal routing and scheduling algorithm that improves delay performance by accounting for the network topology. First, we propose algorithm for the fixed topology scenario. We improve delay performance by solving an optimization problem which aims to send packets mostly to greedy neighbors, subject to throughput-optimality constraints. Next, we consider the network with dynamic topology, where routers or links may be added or removed during time. We propose variations of the proposed algorithm for networks with dynamic topology. We identify key design parameters and illustrate the performance of our schemes through simulations...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{accepted}} {{that in the}} hippocampus new neurons are generated throughout life. In most studies to date, adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been investigated by assessing two key events: the proliferation of the progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus and {{the survival of the}} progeny and expression of neuronal markers about 4 weeks later. Much less is known about the period of neuronal development in between. New born granule cells express several proteins during their development in the adult hippocampus. In our studies we try to investigate whether different developmental stages can be identified by the expression of different calcium binding proteins. We here show that the early postmitotic stage of granule cell development during adult hippocampal neurogenesis is characterized by the transient expression of calretinin (CR, a calcium binding protein). CR expression was detected as early as 1 day after labeling dividing cells with bromodesoxyuridine (BrdU), but not before. Staining for Ki- 67 confirmed that no CR-expressing cells were in cell cycle. Early after BrdU, CR colocalized with immature neuronal marker doublecortin; and later with persisting neuronal marker NeuN. BrdU/CR-labeled cells were negative for GABA and GABA-A 1 receptor, but early on expressed granule cell marker Prox- 1. After 6 weeks, no new neurons expressed CR, but all contained calbindin, the calcium binding protein of mature granule cells. Stimuli inducing adult neurogenesis have strong effects on <b>cell</b> proliferation (voluntary <b>wheel</b> running and kainat induced seizures) and/or a survival promoting effect on the progenitor cells (enriched environment). In the first two models (physical activity and seizures) the induction of cell proliferation was paralleled by an increase of CR-positive cells, whereas the enriched environment shows only a low but not significant {{increase in the number of}} CR-positive cells in the granule cell layer, indicating that the survival promoting effect of the enriched environment affects the new born cells during the late CR-stage. In summary this study yields the following new findings: 	In the adult hippocampus CR is transiently expressed by new born granule cells 	CR-Expression defines the postmitotic step of neuronal development during adult neurogenesis 	During development new born granule cells change their calcium binding protein from CR to Calbindin 	Stimuli of adult neurogenesis have different effects on the number of CR-positive cells due to the differing precursor cell stages that are influenced by the stimuli (Brandt et al., 2003; Mol.

40|$|SDL has {{developed}} an advanced test facility to characterize and verify the performance of small satellites up to 10 kg, thus reducing pre-flight risk. NOVA (Nanosat Operation, Verification, and Assessment), has been in operation since Aug. 2010, and {{has been used to}} test and calibrate a number of CubeSats and payloads, including DICE, PEARL, Falling Sphere, and STAROP. This testing has included determining the attitude determination accuracy of spinning sun sensor magnetometer systems. The test stations are: mass properties, sun sensor calibration and testing, reaction wheel testing and characterization, magnetometer testing and calibration, torquer coil testing and characterization, solar array power generation, and end-to-end system-level testing. Horizon sensor testing is currently being developed. Such a facility is warranted by the anticipated national development rate of dozens of CubeSats per year and an international projection of hundreds of CubeSats per year. Due to the small size of CubeSats and their sensitivity to disturbances, novel testing approaches are needed. For example, a spherical air bearing that was previously used on a larger spacecraft was not an option due to the alignment inaccuracies. A single-axis air bearing with an integrated optical encoder is used to provide truth data for closed loop attitude control testing. The facility considers three classes of nanosats, depending on their accuracy requirements: Class 1 spinning satellites with sun sensors and magnetometers with pointing knowledge of 1 ° and control of 5 °, Class 2 non-spinning spacecraft with sun sensors and magnetometers with pointing knowledge of 0. 2 ° and control of 0. 2 °, and Class 3 non-spinning spacecraft using star trackers with pointing knowledge of 0. 01 ° and control of 0. 02 °. Class 1 can currently be tested with sufficient accuracy using a combination of a spinning attitude determination test and a hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) sensor/dynamics/actuator “flatsat” emulator. Class 2 can also be tested, but with some loss of fidelity, with the HWIL system. Magnetic cleanliness for this class of pointing is a challenge. For Class 3, the test facility will use a highly accurate Stewart platform for motion simulation, and a star simulator source. These upgrades are planned for the future when warranted by the maturity of nanosat-sized star trackers. SDL has a Stewart platform available in its Albuquerque, NM, laboratory. Since a key component of the system-level testing is the HWIL simulation, the component test stations must provide high-fidelity models. The sun sensor test cell uses a simulated sun source and a 2 -axis gimbal with 0. 01 ° repeatability. The horizon sensor test uses an earth simulator plate in front of a liquid nitrogen cooled background representing space. The magnetic test cell for torquer coils and magnetometers uses a 3 -axis Helmholtz cage with a field which can be rotated in real time using closed-loop control to within 10 nanotesla. Dual NIST-traceable differential magnetometers provide highly accurate results. A zero-gauss chamber is also available for magnetometer calibration and determination of nanosat magnetic dipole moment. The reaction <b>wheel</b> test <b>cell</b> measures <b>wheel</b> speed very accurately using 400 MHz sampling and derives the torque analytically. The solar panel test cell provides a continuous AM 0 light source to verify the power output of the solar arrays. A NIST-traceable pyranometer is used to measure the light intensity in the target area. The mass properties test cell features load cells and kinematic mounts to obtain the measurements needed to verify and refine the calculations from the CAD models and to statically and dynamically balance the spacecraft. Mass can be measured within 2 grams (3 σ) and center of gravity to within 1 mm (3 σ). The resulting laboratory provides a single location for evaluating a large set of systems and properties for completed nanosats...|$|R
40|$|Air-to-air energy {{recovery}} wheels are now {{widely used in}} industry and buildings; however, the effectiveness of water vapor exchange in these regenerative wheels appears to be much lower than may be economically feasible. The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate the feasibility of using agglomerated desiccant particle coatings to improve the performance of regenerative wheels used in HVAC air-to-air heat and moisture exchange and {{energy recovery}} applications. Desiccant particles coated on wheels lose most of their water vapor sorption capacity due to the method of coating. Desiccant agglomerates can be made by mixing starch, fine silica gel particulate, and water within an agglomerating device. The desiccant particle agglomerating process improves the desiccant mass transfer properties by increasing the overall surface area of desiccant particles; and also by creating a much rougher surface that can increase the likelihood of turbulent flow, and therefore, increasing the overall mass transfer rates. The industrial desiccant coating process involves submerging the desiccant into a coating agent and then applying this mix to the substrate or the matrix of the energy wheel. This process was improved in this research by ensuring the particles are applied after the coating agent is applied to ensure that the agglomerates or desiccant particles are not submerged by the coating material. Because testing energy wheels under steady state operating conditions has proved to be difficult, time consuming and costly in the past, a small parallel flow test cell is used to measure the transient response of coated substrate aluminum sheets after a step change in the inlet air humidity or temperature. Using a previously developed theoretical model, the time constants for these inlet step change responses are then used to predict the sensible and latent effectiveness of a regenerative energy wheel coated with the same agglomerated particles, which is rotated at a known operating speed and wheel face velocity. When the new desiccant coatings are used, it is shown that the latent heat effectiveness for a typical wheel could be up to 85 %. It is found that the steady state air flow pressure drop readings for the test cell shows that agglomerated particles coated on the surfaces within the test cell implies some transitional turbulent flow behavior compared to similar substrate surfaces coated in a conventional manner with desiccant particles (e. g. up to 60 % higher pressure drop at a channel Reynolds number of 300) in the same test cell. This implied enhanced turbulence flow friction factor in the test cell suggests a somewhat similar enhancement for increased mass and heat transfer coefficients for the test <b>cell</b> or coated <b>wheel</b> matrices. The transient results for humidity step changes for air flow through the test cell reveals that the adsorption and desorption response time constants are much larger for the agglomerated coated substrate surfaces than the conventional industrial coated surfaces. These data imply much higher moisture or latent heat effectiveness values for wheels coated with agglomerated particles. When the new desiccant coatings are used, it is shown that the latent heat effectiveness for a typical wheel could be better than 80 % or 20 % higher than currently available typical energy wheels. With improvements to the desiccant particle agglomerating process, desiccant coating process and particle coating and testing methods, this thesis shows that significant improvements may be practical for the design, testing and operation of regenerative heat and moisture exchange wheels...|$|R
