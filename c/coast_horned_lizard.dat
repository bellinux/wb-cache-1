50|$|The park's {{ecosystems}} {{have encountered}} multiple non-native species not originally {{part of the}} habitat but rather have been introduced and adapted to it over time. One example of non-native species harming native species is the Argentine ant. These ants have displaced the native ants, and this impacted the <b>coast</b> <b>horned</b> <b>lizard</b> population, which only ate the native ants. In those areas where Argentine ants had established colonies, the <b>coast</b> <b>horned</b> <b>lizard</b> is no longer found.|$|E

40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} for simultaneous Bayesian inference of species delimitation and species phylogeny using the multispecies coalescent model. Themethod {{eliminates the need for}} a user-specified guide tree in species delimitation and incorporates phylogenetic uncertainty in a Bayesian framework. The nearest-neighbor interchange algorithm was adapted to propose changes to the species tree, with the gene trees for multiple loci altered in the proposal to avoid conflicts with the newly proposed species tree. We also modify our previous scheme for specifying priors for species delimitation models to construct joint priors for models of species delimitation and species phylogeny. As in our earlier method, the modified algorithm integrates over gene trees, taking account of the uncertainty of gene tree topology and branch lengths given the sequence data. We conducted a simulation study to examine the statistical properties of the method using six populations (two sequences each) and a true number of three species, with values of divergence times and ancestral population sizes that are realistic for recently diverged species. The results suggest that themethod tends to be conservative with high posterior probabilities being a confident indicator of species status. Simulation results also indicate that the power of the method to delimit species increases with an increase of the divergence times in the species tree, and with an increased number of gene loci. Reanalyses of two data sets of cavefish and <b>coast</b> <b>horned</b> <b>lizards</b> suggest considerable phylogenetic uncertainty even though the data are informative about species delimitation. We discuss the impact of the prior on models of species delimitation and species phylogeny and of the prior on population size parameters () on Bayesian species delimitation...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 96 - 108) The <b>Coast</b> <b>Horned</b> <b>Lizard</b> (Phrynosoma coronatum blainvillii) is {{a native}} species of special concern in California. One of the major threats to Coast Horned Lizards, particularly in southern California, is habitat loss and fragmentation. Studies {{have suggested that the}} <b>Coast</b> <b>Horned</b> <b>Lizard</b> selects habitats in chaparral and coastal sage scrub vegetation with friable sandy soils and low to moderate slope percent rise. The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (SMMNRA), located in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, is within the known range of <b>Coast</b> <b>Horned</b> <b>Lizard</b> inhabitation. Due to ecologically disruptive human activity in and around the SMMNRA, potential <b>Coast</b> <b>Horned</b> <b>Lizard</b> highly suitable habitat may be at risk of fragmentation, decrease in suitability and/or complete loss of habitat. This study identifies areas of high <b>Coast</b> <b>Horned</b> <b>Lizard</b> suitability so that these areas may be further studied in regards to actual species presence and human impact. Habitat suitability models and landscape pattern were analyzed to investigate {{the extent to which the}} SMMNRA is suitable for <b>Coast</b> <b>Horned</b> <b>Lizard</b> inhabitation. First, three habitat suitability models were used to classify the habitat suitability of areas in the SMMNRA depending on designated habitat needs such as slope, soil type, and vegetation cover. Then landscape metrics were used to measure habitat fragmentation, particularly for highly suitable areas. 	In the SMMNRA, 70 % of the total land area was found to meet the majority of the habitat suitability criteria (high suitability, HSA) or some of these requirements (high-medium suitability, HMSA) for the <b>Coast</b> <b>Horned</b> <b>Lizard.</b> HMSAs covered from 59 % to 66 % of the SMMNRA, depending on the model???s weighting. Similarities in percent areas were observed between the results for model 1 and model 3. Model 2 showed significantly higher HSA percent (11 %) than other models (3 %) due to increased vegetation weighting. The landscape patterns and metrics of the SMMNRA showed that most of the area is at least HMSA for Coast Horned Lizards. Fragmentation occurred in areas of human impact but did not prevent the connection of suitable habitats within the interior mountain range. Other factors of suitability should be explored in respect to the SMMNRA to gain a more accurate assessment of <b>Coast</b> <b>Horned</b> <b>Lizard</b> habitat. In addition, field surveys would be needed to confirm actual <b>Coast</b> <b>Horned</b> <b>Lizard</b> presence...|$|E

30|$|Rochester et al. (2010 b) {{reported}} that both chaparral and coastal sage scrub herpetofaunal community diversity and composition changed after the large 2003 southern California wildfires. There were increases in some taxa and decreases in others but, overall, these communities remained simplified {{two years after}} fire. They found that the coastal whiptail (Aspidoscelis tigris Baird & Girard), <b>coast</b> <b>horned</b> <b>lizard</b> (Phrynosoma coronatum Blainville), common side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana Blainville), and orange-throated whiptail (Aspidoscelis hyperythra Cope) populations increased after fire. In contrast, the California toad (Anaxyrus boreas halophilus Camp) decreased, {{as was the case}} for the southern alligator lizard (Elgaria multicarinata Blainville), garden slender salamander (Batrachoseps major Camp), and several snake species (yellow-bellied racer, Coluber constrictor Linnaeus; California kingsnake, Lampropeltis californiae Blainville; gophersnake, Pituophis catenifer Blainville; and striped racer, Masticophis lateralis Hallowell). It was apparently unclear how much of these community differences were due to patterns of survivorship versus ability to adapt to postfire conditions of cover, soil moisture, and food resources. However, the authors suspect that the more open conditions after fire were largely responsible for the decreased herpetofaunal diversity and that, with repeated fires, these sites might be type converted to grass-shrub mosaics with a depauperate fauna. This is consistent with Lillywhiteâ€™s (1977) observation of a simplification of the animal community when the shrubland was mechanically and chemically type converted to be more like grassland.|$|E
40|$|Lineage {{separation}} and divergence form a temporally extended process whereby populations may diverge genetically, morphologically, or ecologically, and these contingent properties of species provide the operational criteria necessary for species delimitation. We inferred the historical process of lineage {{formation in the}} <b>coast</b> <b>horned</b> <b>lizard</b> (Phrynosoma coronatum) species complex by evaluating a diversity of operational species criteria, including divergence in mtDNA (98 specimens; 2, 781 bp) and nuclear loci (RAGâˆ’ 1, 1, 054 bp; BDNF 529 bp), ecological niches (11 bioclimatic variables; 285 unique localities), and cranial horn shapes (493 specimens; 16 landmarks). A phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA recovers 5 phylogeographic groups arranged latitudinally along the Baja California Peninsula and in California. The 2 southern phylogeographic groups exhibit concordance between genetic, morphological, and ecological divergence; however, differentiation is weak or absent at more recent levels defined by phylogeographic breaks in California. Interpreting these operational species criteria together {{suggests that there are}} 3 ecologically divergent and morphologically diagnosable species within the P. coronatum complex. Our 3 -species taxonomic hypothesis invokes a deep coalescence event when fitting the mtDNA genealogy into the species tree, which is not unexpected for populations that have diverged recently. Although the hypothesis that the 3 phylogeographic groups distributed across California each represent distinctive species is not supported by all of the operational species criteria evaluated in this study, the conservation status of the imperiled populations represented by these genealogical units remains critical...|$|E
