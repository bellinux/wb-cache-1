30|$|Intermediate casings in the build {{sections}} {{are subject}} to severe wear in extended-reach drilling. This paper presents a new method for predicting the depth of a wear groove on the intermediate casing. According to energy principle and dynamic accumulation of <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> by tool joints, a model is established to calculate the wear area on the inner wall of the casing. The relationship functions between the wear groove depth and area are obtained based on the geometry relationship between the drillstring and the wear section and {{the assumption that the}} <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> groove is crescent-shaped. The change of <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> groove depth versus drilling footage under different-sized drillstrings is also discussed. A mechanical model is proposed for predicting <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> location, which is based on the well trajectory and drillstring movement. The <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> groove depth of a planned well is predicted with inversion of the <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> factor from the drilled well and necessarily revised to improve the prediction accuracy for differences between the drilled well and the planned well. The method for predicting <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> in extended-reach drilling is verified through actual case study. The effect of drillstring size on <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> should be taken into account in <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> prediction.|$|E

The nodal movement of the contact surface was employed to simulate the evolution of the wear depth, exploiting the Umeshmotion user subroutine. In addition, the time-dependent geometry of the contact surfaces between the tool joint and casing was being updated continuously. Consequently, the contact area and contact pressure were changed continuously during the <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> process, which gives a more realistic simulation. Based on the shapes of worn casing, the numerical simulation research was carried out to determine the remaining collapse strength. Then the change curve of the maximum <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> depth with time was obtained. Besides, the relationship between the maximum wear depth and remaining collapse strength was established to predict the maximum wear depth and the remaining strength of the casing after a period of accumulative wear, providing a theoretical basis for the safety assessment of worn casing...|$|E

In order to calculate <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> depth and prevent the <b>casing</b> <b>wear,</b> the wear efficiency and friction coefficient is measured in the different wear time, the contact force and the rotating speed.

The wear efficiency of P 110 casing is change from 2 to 8 × 10 - 13 1 /Pa. The rotating speed has less influence on the wear efficient.

Some advanced well constructions have the casing exposed to reservoir fluidsand these casings are often in chrome material for corrosion resistance.

Two main sources have been consulted {{to understand the nature}} of the tasks:Leading specialists in the oil industry and research/scientific work performedon <b>casing</b> <b>wear.</b> Investigating the background for existing <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> models,scientists and specialists have made themselves available to support thework in this report. The tasks were approached by three categories: Laboratorytests, logged <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> in a well and modeling the wear. Laboratory tests: In the planning phase of Field Y, extensive <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> testswere performed to develop an understanding of potential wear problems tobe expected under the specific field conditions. In this thesis, the data setfrom these laboratory tests were analyzed for two casing grades - SM 125 Sand SM 13 CrS 110 - and used as input in a <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> model to understandthe correlation between theory and actual wear. Logged casing wear: Multiple caliper logs were run in well X at Field Y tomonitor the wear evolution and to calibrate the wear simulations for wellX. These logs have been analyzed in this report to identify the actual wearextent. Modeling wear: Real operational parameters were fed into DrillNET CasingWearto simulate the wear extent in well X, enabling correlation betweenfield and laboratory results. For the chrome casing, the correlation between laboratory and field is poor. Looking into the background of the wear model it was identified that it is notvalid for chrome materials. Analysis of the tests performed in the laboratorysupported this as the chrome steel showed a linear wear trend - indicating alow or no contact pressure threshold. Today, the industry use the <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> model also for chrome casing, bendingone of the key input parameter in the expression for wear; the wear factor. In this practice, the wear factor often varies greatly because it is sensitiveto the many parameters involved in wear prediction and to differences fromtheory to real conditions. For the carbon steel casing, the correlation between laboratory and field resultsis good. The wear model was developed to correct for the non-linearwear pattern for carbon steel. In the work of analyzing logged wear it was found that the industry often usesthe reported wall loss without considering the insecurity of the measurements. The following issues were found to be the main tasks to improve:? Add insecurity of logged results in final well integrity evaluations. ? Establish a standard procedure for wear modeling. ?

Stress of internal wall <b>worn</b> <b>casing</b> string must be analyzed to ensure strength of casing string. In the paper, <b>wear</b> form of <b>casing</b> string is assumed as a crescent-shape, and a half finite element model (FEM) of <b>worn</b> <b>casing</b> string, cement-loop and earth combined system is established using the symmetry. Geometry relationships of wear ratio (or wear depth) and the centre of drill pipe are established. Effects of variables such as <b>wear</b> ratio of <b>casing</b> string, magnification factor of wellbore, elastic modulus of cement-loop and working conditions on casing string stress are discussed respectively. Some conclusions are drawn: maximum stress in casing string increases with increased <b>wear</b> ratio of <b>casing</b> string, and ultimately exceeds the yield limit. Increase of magnification factor of wellbore will improve bearing capacity of casing string, but maximum stress in casing string decreases slower and slower with further increase in magnification factor of casing string, at the same time, stress decreases more in casing string than in cement-loop. Minimum stress in cement-loop increases and maximum stress in cement-loop fluctuates with increased elastic modulus of cement-loop, while both minimum and maximum stress in casing string first increases then decreases, the turning point is related to elastic modulus of casing string and earth, as well as the geometry relationships among them.

The linear wear rate decreased slightly but the average friction coefficient increased slightly with an increase in impact frequency under an impact load of 2, 500 N. Both the linear wear rate of the casing and the average friction coefficient increased substantially with an increase in impact frequency under an impact load of 4, 000 N.

40|$|Maintaining casing integrity, {{in terms}} of {{downhole}} zonal isolations and well stability, is extremely important in oil/gas wells. <b>Casing</b> <b>wear</b> occurs not only in directional drilling, but also in vertical drilling with a slight deviation angle. In most hydrocarbon wells, deteriorated casing was reported from the onset of <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> {{by the presence of}} friction force during the rotation of drillpipe. The friction force against the casing wall causes the reduction of casing strength. Furthermore, the rotation of drillpipe combined with corrosive drilling fluids could dramatically degrade the casing strength. We used a finite element analysis to focus on the stress evolution in worn casings. Comparison study between worn casing and perfect casing was conducted. Our study showed that the thermal load significantly increases the stress concentration of the worn casing in the wellbore. Finite element solutions indicated that the radial stress of the worn casing is not affected as much as the hoop stress. Along with the increased burst pressure or the elevated temperature, the unworn portion of the casing also suffers from severe compression stress.

Together with new technologies involving higher casing conicity for improved compression rates, direct contact is now considered as part of aircraft engines normal life. In order to avoid possibly catastrophic scenarios due to high contact efforts between the rotating and static components, implementation of abradable coatings has been widely recognized as a robust solution offering several advantages: reducing potential damage to the incurring blade as well as adjusting operating clearances, in-situ, to accept physical contact events. Nevertheless, the process of wear undergone by abradable coatings is not well understood and its consequences are still under investigation. In the present work, its macroscopic behavior is numerically approximated through a piecewise linear plastic constitutive law which allows for real time access to the current abradable layer profile. First results prove convergence in time and space of the proposed approach and show that the frequency content of the blade response is clearly affected by the presence of abradable coatings.

40|$|Down-hole damages such as {{borehole}} collapse, {{circulation loss}} and rock tensile/compressive cracking in the open-hole system are well understood at drilling and well completion stages. However, less {{effort has been}} made to understand the instability of cemented sections in High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) wells. The existing analysis shows that, in the perforation zones, casing/cement is subject to instability, particularly in the presence of cavities. This dissertation focuses on the instability mechanism of casing/cement in the non-perforated zones. We investigate the transient thermal behavior in the casing-cement-formation system resulting from the movement of wellbore fluid using finite element method. The critical value of down-hole stresses is identified in both wellbore heating and cooling effects. Differently with the heating effect, the strong cooling effect in a cased hole can produce significant tension inside casing/cement. The confining formation has an obvious influence on the stability of casing/cement. The proposed results reveal that the casing/cement system in the non-homogeneous formation behaves differently from that in homogeneous formation. With this in mind, a three-dimensional layered finite element model is developed to illustrate the casing/cement mechanical behavior in the non-homogeneous formation. The radial stress of cement sheath is found to be highly variable and affected by the contrast in Young?s moduli in the different formation layers. The maximum stress is predicted to concentrate in the casing-cement system confined by the sandstone. <b>Casing</b> <b>wear</b> in the cased-hole system causes significant casing strength reduction, possibly resulting in the casing-cement tangential collapse. In this study, an approach for calculating the stress concentration in the worn casing with considering temperature change is developed, based on boundary superposition. The numerical results indicate that the casing-cement system after <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> will suffer from severe tangential instability due to the elevated compressive hoop stress. Gas migration during the cementing process results from the fluid cement?s inability to balance formation pore pressure. Past experience emphasized the application of chemical additives to reduce or control gas migration during the cementing process. This report presents the thermal and mechanical behaviors in a cased hole caused by created gas channels after gas migration. In conclusion, the size and the number of gas channels are two important factors in determining mechanical instability in a casing-cement system...|$|E
30|$|Tubular string {{buckling}} is {{an important}} issue in well engineering. Buckling makes the initially straight tubular string buckle into curved shapes, which {{is an important}} reason for the well deviation problem. Buckling can also increase both bending stress on the tubular string and the contact force between the tubular string and the wellbore, which may further lead to serious down-hole problems such as tubular string failure, <b>casing</b> <b>wear,</b> hard slack off, or even “lock up.” Down-hole tubular string buckling is usually taken as analogous to the Euler buckling problem for a rod with axial compressive forces on both ends. The rod remains straight until the axial force exceeds a certain value, namely the critical load. When the axial force is larger than the critical value, the initial configuration becomes unstable and the rod buckles into a laterally deformed configuration. However, unlike the free post-buckling deflection of the Euler rod, various external factors, such as the constraint of wellbore, tubular string weight, torque, friction force, etc., make tubular string buckling behavior more complex.|$|E

The deposition of an abradable coating on casings {{is one of the}} technologies used to reduce this blade-casing clearance and ensure blade integrity in the event of blade-casing contact. Aircraft in-service condi-tions may lead to interactions between the blade tip and the coated <b>casing,</b> during which <b>wear</b> of the abradable coating, blade dynamics and interacting force are critical yet little-understood issues. In order to study blade/abradable-coating interactions of a few tens of milliseconds, experiments were conducted on a dedicated test rig. The experi-mental data were analyzed with the aim of determining the friction-induced vibrational modes of the blade. This involved a time-frequency analysis of the experimental blade strain using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, combined with a modal analysis of the blade. The latter was carried out with two kinds of kinematic boundary conditions at the blade tip: free and modified, by imposing contact with the abradable coating. The interaction data show that the blade vibration modes identified during interactions cor-respond to the free boundary condition, due to the transitional nature of the phenomena and the very short duration of contacts. The properties of the Continous Wavelet Trans-form were then used to identify the occurence of blade-coating contact. Two kinds of blade/abradable-coating interactions were identified: bouncing of the blade over short time periods associated with loss of abradable material, and isolated contacts capable of amplifying the blade vibrations without causing significant wear of the abradable coat-ing.

Despite {{the significance of the}} problem in the drilling industry, there is little data on <b>casing</b> <b>wear</b> efficiencies in the public domain. A large body of data collected during a joint industry project was deemed proprietary to participants who sponsored the private project (DEA- 42). In this paper, we outline an approach to determine the wear efficiency of unlubricated surfaces by using the roughness parameters and material properties of the wearing surface. Our method combines the classic Greenwood & Williamson (1966) approach with the Archard-Rabinowicz (1953) interpretation of wear efficiency. The Greenwood & Williamson study models surface morphology as an ensemble of randomly distributed asperities. Archard (1953) interprets wear efficiency as the probability of a wear particle being created during an encounter of asperities between sliding surfaces. By using these notions we derive a formula for wear efficiency of an unlubricated surface {{as a function of the}} standard deviation of its summit height distribution, the summit radius, the hardness and contact modulus. Our predicted wear efficiencies are in the range of 1. 5 - 5 × 10 - 3. These values agree well with published results for similar metals sliding on each other without lubrication.

From this distribution, failure rate, failure function and survival function was found. The presented approach show how it is possible to quantify the reliability of a given design.
