5|$|The Prague Spring {{reforms were}} a strong attempt by Dubček to grant {{additional}} {{rights to the}} citizens of Czechoslovakia in an act of partial decentralization of the economy and democratization. The freedoms granted included a loosening of restrictions on the media, speech and travel. After national discussion of dividing the <b>country</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> federation of three republics, Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia and Slovakia, Dubček oversaw the decision to split into two, the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. This was the only formal change that survived the end of Prague Spring, though the relative success of the nonviolent resistance undoubtedly prefigured and facilitated the peaceful transition to liberal democracy with the collapse of Soviet hegemony in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} {{passed to the}} US Air Force Third Air Force on 1 December 1955, to enable the {{consolidation}} of facilities at several sites in the <b>country</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> single location. On 1 October 1962, the American 7500th Air Base Group was relocated to RAF West Ruislip from RAF South Ruislip. After the US Air Force decided to close RAF South Ruislip and move their headquarters to RAF Mildenhall in 1972, 77 civilian members of staff at West Ruislip were made redundant.|$|E
5|$|In February 1793, the French Republic {{declared}} war on the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, drawing both into the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars. Less than two years later, {{in the winter of}} 17941795, the Dutch Republic was overrun by the French Army, French cavalry charging the Dutch Navy across the ice that blocked its winter anchorages, capturing it intact. The French reorganised the <b>country</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> client state named the Batavian Republic, and ordered the Dutch Navy to operate in the North Sea against British maritime trade routes. The British government did not immediately declare war on the Batavian Republic, but did take steps to seize Dutch shipping in British ports and established a new fleet to combat Batavian operations in the North Sea. The North Sea Fleet, as it was known, was composed mainly of older and smaller vessels not considered suitable for service in the Channel Fleet, and command of this force was given to the 66year old Admiral Adam Duncan.|$|E

5|$|In September 2014, Modi {{introduced}} the Make in India initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India, {{with the goal}} of turning the <b>country</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> global manufacturing hub. Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative, while critics argued it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market. In order to enable the construction of private industrial corridors, the Modi administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it. Under the previous bill, the government had required the consent of 80% of the owners of a piece of property before acquiring it for a private project: this requirement was waived. The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in parliament, but was eventually allowed to lapse. Modi's government put in place the Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence. It subsumed around 17 different taxes and became effective from 1 July 2017.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1794–1795 the armies of the French Republic overran the Dutch Republic, {{reforming}} the <b>country</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> client state named the Batavian Republic. The Dutch Republic {{was part of the}} Coalition against Republican France formed in the War of the First Coalition {{at the start of the}} French Revolutionary Wars, and their closest ally in Northern Europe was Great Britain. In Britain the Admiralty was alarmed by developments in the Netherlands, particularly the seizure of the Dutch Navy by French cavalry units while the fleet was frozen into its winter harbour, and gave orders that the Royal Navy was to detain Dutch merchant and naval ships. As a result, the Batavian Republic and Great Britain began an undeclared war in the spring of 1795.|$|E
5|$|Saudis and Jordanians {{provided}} an active {{support to the}} royalists through {{the first years of}} war. The September 1962 coup d'état in Yemen was perceived a threat to the monarchies in both Saudi Arabia and Jordan, prompting shipments of weapons to the royalists, beginning October 1. The support to the monarchists was quickly countered by the Egyptian aid to the Republicans, rapidly spiraling the <b>country</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> full-scale war, as the Republicans called for general mobilization and the Egyptians dispatching troops. On November 4, with the war expanding across North Yemen, the Mecca Radio reported of Egyptian air force attacks on Saudi villages. The same day, a military alliance of Saudi Arabia and Jordan became widely known. Following the Egyptian raids on Saudi Arabia and the official Joint Defense Pact formed between Egypt and the Republicans, the Saudis decided to launch attacks on the Republicans in North Yemen.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Saraiva, Ouro Preto was {{a staunch}} monarchist who was {{determined}} to save the regime at any cost. His program of reforms was highly ambitious and aimed at resolving festering issues about which politicians had long been complaining. An item notably missing from his agenda was any move to address the military indiscipline and the urgent necessity of restoration of government authority over the corps. This {{would prove to be}} a fatal mistake. Among the reforms proposed were the expanding of voting rights by abolishing the income requisite, the end of lifelong senate tenures and, most important of all, increased decentralization which would turn the <b>country</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> full federation by allowing the election of town mayors and provincial presidents (governors).|$|E
5|$|Alonso {{was born}} {{in the small town of}} Tolosa, Gipuzkoa, Basque <b>Country,</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> family known for its footballing prowess. His father, Periko Alonso, won La Liga twice in {{successive}} seasons with Real Sociedad and a third time after he joined Barcelona. He also featured in the national team, winning 21 caps over the course of his career. Xabi Alonso lived in the city of Barcelona for the first six years of his life and moved to San Sebastián (Donostia) thereafter. It was here that his passion for football began as he whiled away his childhood playing at Playa de la Concha (Shell Beach). On the Basque sands, Alonso befriended a fellow resident of Calle Matia, Mikel Arteta, and the two would battle each other in exhibitions of technical ability. He was immersed in football and his father would often bring him and his older brother, Mikel, to CE Sabadell's training ground to practice together. Alonso was influenced by his father's playing, taking more pleasure in passing the ball well than shooting at goal. At an early age, he decided to play as a defensive midfielder, a role which helped him learn how to distribute the ball well. This talent would later prove to be an integral part of his club and international career.|$|E

50|$|The liberal {{rulers of}} the late 19th century saw {{immigration}} as the possibility of bringing people from supposedly more civilized, enlightened <b>countries</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> sparsely populated land, thus diminishing the influence of aboriginal elements and turning Argentina <b>into</b> <b>a</b> modern society with a dynamic economy. However, immigrants did not bring only their knowledge and skills.|$|R
50|$|The {{economy grew}} between the 1950s and 1970s {{at one of}} the fastest rates in the world, {{changing}} Romania from <b>a</b> predominantly agricultural <b>country</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> industrialized <b>country.</b> Almost 30% of the population moved during this period from rural to urban areas to work in the newly-built factories.|$|R

25|$|The {{collapse}} of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe in 1989 and {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union in 1991 caused a crisis in the Cuban economy. The Soviets were Cuba's chief trading partner, and had effectively sheltered Cuba's sugar industry with large subsidies for 30 years. The lack of economic diversification during this period, and the sudden loss of key markets sent the <b>country</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> deep economic depression known in Cuba as the Special Period. The crisis precipitated the communist regime to find new avenues of income.|$|E
25|$|Negative reports {{continued}} {{to reach the}} American delegation {{through a variety of}} Vietnamese civilian figures. A group of university professors complained to McNamara that Diệm had transformed the <b>country</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> police state with widespread use of torture.

The mission was also informed by the French embassy and the Canadian and Indian members of the International Control Commission that was charged with enforcing the Geneva Accords that Nhu was pursuing a peace agreement with North Vietnam and that an agreement would be reached in the next three or four months.|$|E
50|$|The intransigence of the Chinese hardliners {{resulted}} in a bloody clash between French and Chinese troops near Bac Le on 23 June 1884, which plunged both <b>countries</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fresh crisis.

He defeated the Byzantines and conquered their Armenian territories, crushed an Armenian rebellion in 704-705 and made the <b>country</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> Umayyad province.|$|R
25|$|The {{end of the}} {{occupation}} in November 1918, squared {{with a time of}} uncertainty on the international and national levels. The victorious Allies disapproved of the choices made by the local élites, and some Belgian politicians even demanded the (re)integration of the <b>country</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> greater Belgium. Within Luxembourg, a strong minority asked {{for the creation of a}} republic. In the end, the grand duchy remained a monarchy but was led by a new head of state, Charlotte. In 1921, it entered into an economic and monetary union with Belgium, the Union Économique Belgo-Luxembourgeoise (UEBL). During most of the 20th century, however, Germany remained its most important economic partner.|$|E
25|$|Tragedy {{struck the}} family in the summer of 1883, when a {{debilitating}} fever swept through the family. Johnny's half-sister Annie, 13, was the first to succumb; and his mother died shortly thereafter. By the time September 1883 had passed, three more McGraw children had died. The devastated family moved from their house in the <b>country</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> hotel in town. Johnny's father, understandably bitter, heaped even more responsibility on the young boy's shoulders, and had very little patience for his son's passion for baseball. He became abusive toward the boy; and later on in 1885 (still only 12 years old), Johnny ran away. From that day onward, young John was raised by a kindly neighbor, Mary Goddard, under whose care he did quite well.|$|E
25|$|In March 1997 riots {{spread across}} Albania after the {{collapse}} of the financial system which drove the <b>country</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> serious economical and social crisis. This crisis culminated in a massive civil disorder known as the Lottery Uprising. Thousands of people had lost their entire savings after all pyramids of the usurers had collapsed. The people then rioted in the streets. After army and police weapons depots were looted by insurgents, some 1500 people had been killed. Albania quickly became dangerous for foreign nationals residing there. On March 11 all foreigners were instructed to leave Albania; Italian and U.S. forces conducted initial evacuation operations. By midday of March 13 it was no longer possible to leave the country by conventional means as the rioters had substantively disrupted national peace and order. With nowhere to go 98 persons fled to the German embassy, which had not yet evacuated.|$|E
