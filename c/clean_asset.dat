Used in conjunction with Wi-Fi enabled smart thermostats, control switches and other grid-connected devices, the applications provide improved reliability, predictability, and availability when forecasting and executing demand response control events. These applications transform demand response from a resource typically used for emergency peak load reduction to a quick-responding, <b>clean</b> energy operational <b>asset.</b>|$|R
40|$|NASA Goddard Space Flight Center has {{developed}} two unique coating formulations {{that will keep}} surfaces clean and sanitary and contain contaminants. The Lotus Dust Mitigation Coating, modeled after the self-cleaning, water-repellant lotus leaf, disallows buildup of dust, dirt, water, and more on surfaces. This coating, has been successfully tested on painted, aluminum, glass, silica, and some composite surfaces, could aid in keeping medical <b>assets</b> <b>clean.</b> The Molecular Adsorber Coating is a zeolite-based, sprayable molecular adsorber coating, designed to prevent outgassing in materials in vacuums. The coating works well to adsorb volatiles and contaminates in manufacturing and processing, such as in pharmaceutical production. The addition of a biocide would also aid in controlling bacteria levels...|$|R
40|$|Consistent, {{accurate}} and timely data {{are essential to}} the functioning of a modern organization. Managing the integrity of an organization’s data assets in a systematic manner is a challenging task in the face of continuous update, transformation and processing to support business operations. Classic approaches to constraint-based integrity focus on logical consistency within a database and reject any transaction that violates consistency, but leave unresolved how to fix or manage violations. More ad hoc approaches focus on the accuracy of the data and attempt to <b>clean</b> data <b>assets</b> after the fact, using queries to flag records with potential violations and using manual efforts to repair. Neither approach satisfactorily addresses the problem from an organizational point of view. In this thesis, we provide a conceptual model of constraint-based integrity management (CBIM) that flexibly combines both approaches in a systematic manner to provide improved integrity management. We perform a gap analysis that examines the criteria that are desirable for efficient management of data integrity. Our approach involves creating a Data Integrity Zone and an On Deck Zone in the database for separating the clean data from data that violates integrity constraints. We provide tool support for specifying constraints in a tabular form and generating triggers that flag violations of dependencies. We validate this by performing case studies on two systems used to manage healthcare data: PAL-IS and iMED-Learn. Our case studies show that using views to implement the zones does not cause any significant increase in the running time of a process...|$|R
50|$|After {{graduating from}} Middlebury College, Somers {{worked as a}} {{roughneck}} on the oil rigs of Midland, Texas, where he came to know future President of the United States George W. Bush. The young Bush helped Somers to get his first real career break as a landman. He soon moved to California, where he supported in 1981 {{the development of the}} first privately owned, commercial-sized run-of-river hydroelectric project in the western United States—the Bailey Creek Ranch Project, followed by the Montgomery Creek Hydroelectric Project—both of which are considered 'model' environmental projects even today. Somers maintains a 33% stake in Montgomery Creek Associates, a private limited partnership that has independently owned and operated <b>clean,</b> renewable energy <b>assets</b> in the western United States since 1985. After serving as Chairman of the Small Power Producers' Association of California, Somers was recruited by the U.S. Agency for International Development to live in India as Resident Adviser from 1992 onwards to supervise the India Private Power Initiative, supporting India's Union Ministry of Power to attract private investment into India's power sector. During this period, Somers traveled extensively to most Indian states, becoming an expert on India's emerging energy sector. With the support of U.S. Ambassador Frank G. Wisner, this specialized knowledge of India enabled Somers to brief U.S. Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary and Commerce Secretary Ron Brown (U.S. politician) when these U.S. Cabinet officials made their historic, maiden visits to India.|$|R
40|$|Renewable energy {{provided}} almost 10 {{per cent}} of Australia’s {{electricity in the}} last 12 months {{and more than half}} a million household solar power systems are now installed on Australian rooftops – around 35 times the amount just three years ago at the end of 2008. Over one million Australians now live in a solar household. Solar power has come of age and is now a real part of Australia’s energy sector. Clean Energy Council Director Kane Thornton said Australia had set a target of sourcing 20 per cent of its electricity from renewable energy such as solar, wind, bioenergy, wave and geothermal power by 2020. “The good news is we are now well on the way to achieving the 20 % renewable energy target,” he said. “The last year has been a drought breaker in more ways than one. As well as giving Australia’s farmers a boost, extra rainfall in key hydro power catchments made a huge difference, providing just over two-thirds of our renewable energy over the last year. “We are already starting to see a boost from the energy produced by wind farms, with wind energy supplying enough clean electricity to power the equivalent of around 900, 000 homes. Wind power is the lowest-cost form of renewable energy that can be rolled out on a large scale and we expect it to play a major part in meeting Australia’s 20 per cent renewable energy target by 2020. “Overall, renewable energy produced enough power for more than four million homes and came at a very low cost to consumers. ” While household renewable energy technologies such as solar power had an extremely successful year, industrial scale clean energy such as wind farms increased more modestly. This was mostly due to uncertainty around the introduction of a price on carbon. Mr Thornton said it had been a challenging couple of years for large scale clean energy developers, but the industry was optimistic about the year ahead. “Now that we have a carbon price in place, we expect to see many clean energy companies investing in major projects in 2012 and beyond. This was the reform we needed to help unlock some major deals during the first half of next year. “Clean energy is now a major industry employing thousands of people and this represents real opportunity for rural and regional areas in particular,” he said. Key findings from the report include: Renewable energy produced 9. 6 % of Australia’s electricity in the 12 months from 1 October 2010 to 30 September 2011. As of August 2011, 1031 MW of solar power was installed in Australia – representing more than 500, 000 household systems. More than 230, 000 of these were installed between January and August this year. Investment figures from Bloomberg New Energy Finance show that the Australian clean energy market was worth $ 5. 2 billion in the 2010 - 11 financial year. More than 8000 people are directly employed in the installation, construction and maintenance of <b>clean</b> energy <b>assets,</b> but this doesn’t include thousands more who are employed in administration, project management, sales etc...|$|R
40|$|A major {{financial}} sector reform {{program has been}} implemented in Ghana since the early 1980 s, involving financial liberalization and institutional reforms. Financial reforms became necessary, because the pre-reform policies together with acute and prolonged economic crisis had severely damaged the financial system. In the early 1990 s, the government launched financial market liberalization policies under the financial sector adjustment program to restructure the distressed banks and <b>clean</b> up nonperforming <b>assets</b> in order to restore banks to profitability and viability. The study investigated the market structure of Ghana 2 ̆ 7 s banking industry and determined whether the market structure has been changed after the financial restructuring. This study specifically measures the degree of competition of the banking system in Ghana by using the H-statistic. Various studies {{on the degree of}} competition were reviewed. This study employs a widely used nonstructural methodology put forward by Panzar and Rosse (1987) [...] the H-statistic [...] and draws upon comprehensive average annual data from the various issues of the Bank of Ghana annual reports from 1988 to 2008. Maximum likelihood techniques were used to estimate the model. Based on the reported H-statistic for pre and postliberalization (2. 35657 and 3. 27530 respectively), it can be concluded that Ghana 2 ̆ 7 s banks are operating under perfect competition. However, the test for a change in competition status at the time of liberalization was not significant, indicating no evidence of a change in competition as a result of liberalization. The result of the market equilibrium reveals that the market equilibrium equals zero, revealing the existence of long-run equilibrium making the Panzar and Rosse model meaningful to interpret. The findings are consistent with the results obtained by Yuan (2006) who found Chinese banking market to be near perfect competition. This study has extended and strengthened some earlier results on bank competition in Ghana. However, {{the results of this study}} are different from the study undertaken by Buchs and Mathisen (2005), who found Ghanaian banking markets to operate under monopolistic conditions without considering the effect of liberalization. Three innovations of the current study are the use of comprehensive data source, the consideration of longer period of time covering two decades (1988 - 2008) and the incorporation of liberalization factors. Overall, the Panzar and Rosse model is regarded as a valuable tool for assessing the banking market conditions in Ghana. Since a bank 2 ̆ 7 s revenue is more likely to be observable than output prices and quantities or actual costs...|$|R
