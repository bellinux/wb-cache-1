2500|$|In 2008, the Perm Krai ombudswoman Tatyana Margolina {{reported}} that 14 women with disabilities {{were subjected to}} compulsory medical sterilization in the Ozyorskiy psychoneurological nursing home whose director was Grigory Bannikov. The sterilizations were performed {{not on the basis}} of a mandatory court decision appropriate for them, but only on the basis of the application by the guardian Bannikov. On 2 December 2010, the court did not find <b>corpus</b> <b>delicti</b> in the compulsory medical sterilizations performed by his consent. The order by the health minister of the Russian Federation that was issued in 1993 and neatly determined the procedure of forced abortion and sterilization of women with disabilities was repealed by the head of Ministry of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation Tatyana Golikova in 2009. Therefore, now women can be subjected to compulsory sterilization without court decision, according to Tatyana Margolina, which may place some types of people within their nation at risk. In Russia, one of the supporters of preventive eugenics is the president of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia Yuri Savenko, who justifies forced sterilization of women, which is practiced in Moscow psychoneurological nursing homes, and states that “one needs a more strictly adjusted and open control for the practice of preventive eugenics, which, in itself, is, in its turn, justifiable.” ...|$|E

Under {{the direction of the}} Allied Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean the mine-sweeping operation took place within Albanian territorial waters, but without authorisation by the Albanian government, and had the additional purpose of using the mines as <b>corpora</b> <b>delicti</b> to prove that the British were acting in self defence by attempting to clear hazards to navigation.|$|R
40|$|Resumé The goal of {{this thesis}} is to analyse <b>corpora</b> <b>delicti</b> of the crimes of murder and {{manslaughter}} according to sections 140 and 141 of the Criminal Code, evaluate their present application by Czech courts, and to point out possible solutions to some problematic or unclarified questions. In the beginning, the thesis concerns itself with historical development of intentional homicides in the Czech country with emphasis on great codifications of 18 th and 19 th century. Subsequently, the interest shifts onto the question of human life {{as an object of}} intentional homicides. The core of the thesis is a thorough analysis of the crimes of murder and manslaughter, their mutual relation, and systematic incorporation in the Criminal Code. After that, there follows a short comparative assessment of the same topic in French law according to Code pénal. Then, attention is paid to developmental stages of mentioned crimes. The chosen topic is methodologically addressed in a way that every subtopic is first examined from the doctrinal theoretical point of view, and then treated in the light of judicial practice. Thus, it is presented how Czech practise of the courts interprets the written law with emphasis on terms and features that have not been used in Czech law so far. The result of this thesis is mainly the discovery [...] ...|$|R
2500|$|The four {{operators}} {{of the site}} were convicted by Stockholm district court on 17 April 2009 and sentenced to one year in jail each {{and a total of}} 30millionSwedish kronor (approximately US$3.5million, €2.7million) in fines and damages. The court found that the defendants were all guilty of accessory to crime against copyright law, strengthened by the commercial and organized nature of the activity. The court, however, never presented its <b>corpus</b> <b>delicti</b> (that is, it never attempted to prove that a crime was committed, but it succeeded in proving that someone was an accessory to that crime). Prosecutor Håkan Roswall cited in his closing arguments a Supreme Court of Sweden opinion that a person holding the jacket of someone committing battery can be held responsible for the battery. In its verdict, the court stated that [...] "responsibility for assistance can strike someone who has only insignificantly assisted in the principal crime", referring to a Supreme Court precedent where an accountant was sentenced for accessory to crime even though his actions were not criminal per se. The court rejected the charge of preparation to crime against copyright law. The lawyers of all four defendants appealed the verdict, with Lundström's lawyers filing their appeal immediately on the day the verdict was given. The entertainment industry lawyers appealed as well, on reintroducing the dismissed charge and on the method of calculating damages, which in their opinion does not fully cover the lost income.|$|E

She now suspects Jasper of Edwin's murder, but keeps her thoughts to herself. She tells Grewgious, who is watching Neville,--"I have a fancy for keeping him under my eye,"-- that Jasper has made love to her, and Grewgious replies in a parody of [...] "God save the King"! ...|$|E

Really, of course, Neville is quite safe. There is no <b>corpus</b> <b>delicti,</b> no carcase of the missing Edwin Drood.|$|E

I have looked at the extract from your speech, which [...] is to be alleged as the <b>corpus</b> <b>delicti,</b> with a jealous eye. It [...] seems well to be prepared for the worst.

6000|$|The {{charge of}} Fairbrother was much cramped by his having {{failed in the}} proof which he {{expected}} to lead. But he fought his losing cause with courage and constancy. He ventured to arraign {{the severity of the}} statute under which the young woman was tried. [...] "In all other cases," [...] he said, [...] "the first thing required of the criminal prosecutor was to prove unequivocally that the crime libelled had actually been committed, which lawyers called proving the <b>corpus</b> <b>delicti.</b> But this statute, made doubtless with the best intentions, and under the impulse of a just horror for the unnatural crime of infanticide, ran the risk of itself occasioning the worst of murders, the death of an innocent person, to atone for a supposed crime which may never have been committed by anyone. He was so far from acknowledging the alleged probability of the child's violent death, that he could not even allow that there was evidence of its having ever lived." ...|$|E

6000|$|But Alaric {{was not at}} {{the moment}} {{inclined}} to meditate much on the long years of judges. He was thinking, or perhaps trying to think, whether it would not be better for him to save this crowd that was now gathered together all further trouble, and plead guilty at once. He knew he was guilty, he could not understand that it was possible that any juryman should have a doubt about it; he had taken the money that did not belong to him; that would be made quite clear; he had taken it, and had not repaid it; there was the absolute <b>corpus</b> <b>delicti</b> in court, {{in the shape of a}} deficiency of some thousands of pounds. What possible doubt would there be in the breast of anyone as to his guilt? Why should he vex his own soul by making himself for a livelong day the gazing-stock for the multitude?

60|$|For the moment, indeed, it {{were all}} well, could Archbishop Beaumont but be prevailed upon--to wink with one eye! Alas, Beaumont would himself so fain do it: for, {{singular}} to tell, the Church too, and whole posthumous hope of Jesuitism, now hangs by the apron of this same unmentionable woman. But then 'the force of public opinion'? Rigorous Christophe de Beaumont, {{who has spent}} his life in persecuting hysterical Jansenists and incredulous Non-confessors; or even their dead bodies, if no better might be,--how shall he now open Heaven's gate, and give Absolution with the <b>corpus</b> <b>delicti</b> still under his nose? Our Grand-Almoner Roche-Aymon, for his part, will not higgle with a royal sinner about turning of the key: {{but there are other}} Churchmen; there is a King's Confessor, foolish Abbe Moudon; and Fanaticism and Decency are not yet extinct.

6000|$|Everyone in Scotland, except {{resolute}} Whigs, {{believed the}} vessel attacked {{to have been}} Captain Drummond's 'Speedy Return.' But there was nothing definite to prove the fact; there was no <b>corpus</b> <b>delicti.</b> In fact the case was parallel {{to that of the}} Campden mystery, in which three people were hanged for killing old Mr. Harrison, who later turned up in perfect health. In Green's, as in the Campden case, some of the accused confessed their guilt, and yet evidence later obtained tends to prove that Captain Drummond and his ship and crew were all quite safe at the date of the alleged piracy by Captain Green. None the less, it does appear that Captain Green had been pirating somebody, and perhaps he was 'none the waur o' a hanging,' though, as he had an English commission to act against pirates, it was argued that, if he had been fighting at all, it was against pirates that he had been making war. Now Haines's remark that Captain Drummond, as he heard, had turned pirate, looks very like a 'hedge' to be used in case the 'Worcester' was proved to have attacked the 'Speedy Return.' ...|$|E

60|$|On {{the charge}} of murder they were not tried in September. Sir Christopher Turner would not proceed 'because the body of Harrison was not found.' There was no <b>corpus</b> <b>delicti,</b> no {{evidence}} that Harrison was really dead. Meanwhile John Perry, as if to demonstrate his lunacy, declared that his mother and brother had tried to poison him in prison! At the Spring Assizes in 1661, Sir B. Hyde, less legal than Sir Christopher Turner, did try the Perrys on {{the charge of}} murder. How he could do this does not appear, for {{the account of the}} trial is not in the Record House, and I am unable at present to trace it. In the Arminian Magazine, John Wesley publishes a story {{of a man who was}} hanged for murdering another man, whom he afterwards met in one of the Spanish colonies of South America. I shall not here interrupt the tale of the Perrys by explaining how a hanged man met a murdered man, but the anecdote proves that to inflict capital punishment for murder without proof that murder has been committed is not only an illegal but an injudicious proceeding. Probably it was assumed that Harrison, if alive, would have given signs of life in the course of nine or ten months.|$|E
60|$|The {{writer was}} to have meanwhile, before our {{migration}} of 1855, a considerable lecturing activity. A confused, yet perfectly recoverable recollection, on my own part, of these years, connects itself with our knowledge that our father engaged in that practice and that he went forth for the purpose, with my mother always in earnest and confident even though slightly fluttered attendance, at about the hour of our upward procession to bed; which fact lent to the proceeding--that is to his--a strange air of unnatural riot, quite as of torch-lighted and wind-blown dissipation. We went to plays and to ballets, and they had comparatively speaking no mystery; but at no lecture had we ever been present, and these put on for my fancy at least a richer light and shade, very much as if we ourselves {{had been on the}} performing side of the curtain, or the wonder of admiring (in our mother's person) and of being admired (in our father's) had been rolled for us into a single glory. This glory moreover was not menaced, but only made more of a thrill by the prime admirer's anxiety, always displayed at the last, as to whether they were not starting without the feature of features, the <b>corpus</b> <b>delicti</b> or manuscript itself; which it was legendary with us that the admired had been known to drive back for in an abashed flurry at the moment we were launched in dreams of him as in full, though mysterious, operation. I can see him now, from the parlour window, {{at the door of the}} carriage and under the gusty street-lamp, produce it from a coat-tail pocket and shake it, for her ideal comfort, in the face of his companion.
