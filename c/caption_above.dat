5000|$|There is a {{panel with}} {{what appears to}} be a clergyman {{touching}} or possibly striking a woman's face. No one knows the significance of this scene or the <b>caption</b> <b>above</b> it: ubi unus clericus et Ælfgyva ("where in which a certain cleric and Ælfgyva"), where Ælfgyva is the Latinised spelling of Ælfgifu, a popular Anglo-Saxon woman's name (literally [...] "elf-gift"). The use of the grapheme Æ shows familiarity with English spelling. There are two naked male figures in the border below this figure; the one directly below the figure is squatting and displaying genitalia, a scene that was frequently censored in former reproductions. However, similar naked figures appear elsewhere in the lower border where there seems to be no connection at all with the main action. Harold had a younger sister named Ælfgifu (her name is spelt Alveva in Domesday) who was possibly promised to William by Harold or even betrothed to him, but she died c. 1066, prior to the invasion.|$|E

40|$|Placing {{figures and}} tables in LATEX {{documents}} always raises questions, {{especially when the}} figures and tables shouldn’t float, or when captions are needed. Often, users try to achieve this {{through the use of}} the [h] parameter. But since the parameter is optional, and since LATEX isn’t required to honor it, using [h] doesn’t always put the table or figure quite where “here ” is given. The float package provides one alternative. This package, which provides definitions for other floating objects such as program code or algorithms, offers [H] as an additional parameter. This does indeed place the floats “here ” or {{at the beginning of the}} next page, but captions are limited to beneath the float. However, it is typographically correct for tables always to have their <b>captions</b> <b>above</b> the float. The nonfloat package follows the recommendations in [1, 2] and defines various commands for non-floating objects. Furthermore, adjustments via the placement parameters,, and follow the specifications in [1]. Additionally, length declarations for placing floats on separate “float pages ” have been adjusted so that vertical centering no longer occurs. Tables and figures are not in general centered, although a one-line entry is produced centered.

In so doing, the vertical spacing for table captions (supertitle) is determined in the same way as for figure captions (subtitle). From [1] the narrow environment was adopted. Using this environment, you can set not only narrow text, but through the use of negative lengths, it is possible to have very wide figures, tables, etc., stick out in the margins...|$|R
50|$|Of all {{the images}} of visiting messengers, nobles and dancersheld within the upper register, a few individuals, and one {{recently}} discovereddetail in particular, stand out. Conspicuously placed upon a raised platform onthe upper register of the south wall, just above two holes where wooden beamshad once ran through to help support the structure, stands a lone figure (HF 16)presenting a child (HF 15) to the lords. At first, many thought that this childwas the young heir; however, as noted previously, the central dancing figurebelow (HF 63) was {{the heir to the}} throne at Bonampak. Yet, even without havingdecoded the glyphs next to the three festive brothers, one notices a couple ofpeculiarities. Firstly, the young figure is actually wearing face paint andgarments that are suggestive of a girl, perhaps a wife for the future ruler. Secondly, no one is looking at the child, not even theindividual holding her. In fact, he is glancing over his left shoulder into theupper register of the west wall at the figure (HF 19) sitting upon an elevatedthrone. This seated figure is likely Yajaw Chaan Muwan, ruler of Bonampak. Itis important to mention here that the <b>caption</b> <b>above</b> this individual, like somany captions in Structure 1, was left blank. Therefore, the identification ofHF 19 as Yajaw Chaan Muwan is deduced rather than known unequivocally based ona name glyph. Beneath the throne, one can view five bundles, albeit with somedifficulty. It was not until ProfessorMary Miller’s aforementioned Bonampak Documentation Project that scholarsfinally knew what these bundles contained. After analyzing infrared images of thisscene, glyphs for “5 pi kakaw” wererevealed. “Kakaw” was the classicMaya term for the cacao bean, and Harvard University professor David Stuart hassuggested that the “pi” glyphrepresents units of 8,000 beans. Therefore, if this is so, it appears thatthere has been a tribute payment to Yajaw Chaan Muwan of 40,000 cacao beans,which is a considerable sum of wealth. Finally, in the vaultacross the whole scene in Room 1, the faces of the Sun God are shown as itmoves across the sky. On the east wall, a large crocodilian, representing thevault of the sky, carries the myriad avatars of the Sun God upon its back.|$|E
