2500|$|It {{has been}} argued that the current {{challenges}} facing risk assessments can be addressed with TKTD modeling. [...] TKTD models were derived in response to a couple of factors. [...] One is the lack of time being considered as a factor in toxicity and risk assessment. [...] Some of the earliest developed TKTD models, such as the Critical Body Residue (CBR) model and <b>Critical</b> <b>Target</b> Occupation (CTO) model, have considered time as a factor but a criticism has been that they are for very specific circumstances such as reversibly acting toxicants or irreversibly acting toxicants. [...] Further extrapolation of the CTO and CBR models are DEBtox, which can model sublethal endpoints, and hazard versions of the CTO, which takes into account stochastic death as opposed to individual tolerance. [...] Another significant step to developing TKTD models was the incorporation of a state variable for damage. [...] By using damage as a toxicodynamic state-variable, modeling intermediate recovery rates can be accomplished for toxicants that act reversibly with their targets, without the assumptions of instant recovery (CBR model) or irreversible interactions (CTO model). TKTD models that incorporate damage are the Damage Assessment Model (DAM) and the Threshold Damage Model (TDM). For what may seem like straightforward endpoints, a variety of different TKTD approaches exist. [...] A review of the assumptions and hypotheses of each was previously published {{in the creation of a}} general unified threshold model of survival (GUTS).|$|E
40|$|Summary Time-critical {{decision}} making in crisis situations stresses the limits of human capabilities. The Joint community recognizes that both decision support and process changes {{are essential to the}} successful prosecution of Time <b>Critical</b> <b>Targets</b> (TCT). The Air Force’s approach to process change, as identified in the AF Concept of Operations for TCTs, is encapsulated in Dynamic Battle Management (DBM). A key tenet of DBM is providing the decision support and infrastructure services required for TCT prosecution. Several decision aids for time <b>critical</b> <b>targeting,</b> including Time <b>Critical</b> <b>Targeting</b> Aid (TCTA) and weapon to target pairing tools have been developed and evaluated in recent exercises, including DBM simulations and Roving Sands. They and other tools under development, such as Joint Target Execution (JTE) and Attack Operations Decision Aid (AODA), are proposed for inclusion in future experiments such as EFX 99. We maintain that effective decision support for TCT will require more than the development of decision aid applications. The prosecution of TCTs exists within the larger context of combat operations, and the development of effective decision support requires a system engineering perspective. This paper provides overviews of selected decision aids for TCT, of results from recent AF exercises, and of proposals for future evaluations. It identifies “holes ” that must be filled before decision aids can provide a truly effective decision support capability. Background Time <b>Critical</b> <b>Targets</b> (TCTs) are targets of short duration that cannot be prosecuted during the normal targeting process. The specific time and location of a TCT are unknown, and due to its short duration a TCT must be prosecuted when observed. The Air Force’s approach for prosecuting TCTs is documented in the “Combat Air Force...|$|R

Efferent arterioles appear to play a lesser role; experimental evidence supports both vasoconstriction and vasodilation, with perhaps the former in the lower range and the latter in the higher range of NaCl concentrations (2). When feedback regulation of afferent arteriolar tone is prevented by interrupting the feedback loop, and when the sensing mechanism is fully activated by saturating NaCl concentrations, TGF reduces GFR on average by approximately 45% and PGC by approximately 20%. Afferent arteriolar resistance increases by 50% or less, consistent with a radius reduction of approximately 10%, if Poiseuille's law holds.

Rather, the threshold for defended adiposity is increased in environments providing ubiquitous access to palatable, high-fat foods, making it difficult to achieve and maintain weight loss.

However, it was filled with traffic moving westwards from the supply dumps, and this gave the impression of a strong force being present; when three German tanks probed towards the bridge and encountered the minefield, they pulled back in the belief the town was heavily defended.|$|E
50|$|This chapter critiques the {{standing}} aesthetics {{of music as}} Hanslick sees it, which {{he refers to as}} the “aesthetics of feeling.” He also asserts the autonomy of music, writing, “The beautiful is and remains beautiful though it arouse no emotion whatever, and though there be no one to look at it. In other words, although the beautiful exists for the gratification of an observer, it is independent of him.” He cites the following authors to demonstrate “how deeply these doctrines of emotion have taken root:” Mattheson, Neidthardt, J.N.
