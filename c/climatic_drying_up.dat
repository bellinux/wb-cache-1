Some of the results are at variance with previous interpretations of Mesolithic human impacts and {{the timing of the}} transition to farming in Atlantic Scotland. High charcoal values and the occurrence of cereal-type pollen grains, which have commonly been used to infer human activity during the Mesolithic, appear in the Oban area at least to be related to climate change. However, the greater frequency of woodland-decline episodes in inland and upland areas prior to 5000 BP is more easily explained in terms of human impact. Archaeological and palynological evidence indicates that the Mesolithic–Neolithic transition in the Oban area occurred at c. 5000 BP and, on evidence from elsewhere in northern Britain, coincided with a marked shift to <b>drier</b> <b>climatic</b> conditions. <b>Up</b> until c. 1000 BP agricultural communities appear to have had comparatively little impact on the environment. Thereafter, there was rapid and permanent deforestation possibly linked {{to the development of a}} distinctive land-use strategy and settlement pattern that survived until the nineteenth century ad...|$|R

50|$|The Caspian Sea, {{like the}} Black Sea, Namak Lake, and Lake Urmia, is {{a remnant of}} the ancient Paratethys Sea. It became {{landlocked}} about 5.5 million years ago due to tectonic uplift and a fall in sea level. During warm and <b>dry</b> <b>climatic</b> periods, the landlocked sea almost <b>dried</b> <b>up,</b> depositing evaporitic sediments like halite that were covered by wind-blown deposits and were sealed off as an evaporite sink when cool, wet climates refilled the basin. (Comparable evaporite beds underlie the Mediterranean.) Due to the current inflow of fresh water, the Caspian Sea is a freshwater lake in its northern portions, and is most saline on the Iranian shore, where the catchment basin contributes little flow. Currently, the mean salinity of the Caspian is one third that of Earth's oceans. The Garabogazköl embayment, which <b>dried</b> <b>up</b> when water flow from {{the main body of}} the Caspian was blocked in the 1980s but has since been restored, routinely exceeds oceanic salinity by a factor of 10.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} spatial and {{temporal}} variability of the climatic parameters and their consequence on the <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> of streams Bô and Débo and on the refill of the ground-water sheet in Soubré area. Methodology used is articulated around {{the study of the}} hydrological assessment according to Thornthwaite in the two catchments, the study of the seasonal and interannual variability of the climatic variables and the study of <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> by the determination of the coefficients of <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> and the mobilized volumes as well as their evolution. The hydrological assessment reveals that evapotranspiration is very active in the area of Soubré and has particularly contributed to reduce water resources of the area. Indeed, on the totality of rainfall, only 5. 24 % joined the underground network to refill the groundwater. The evolution of the curves of <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> reveals that, in Débo and Bô catchments, <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> lasts in general between 30 and 160 days. The coefficients of <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> in the both watersheds knew a rise of 1983 to 1991. Since 1991 there has been a relative decline in these coefficients. Thus, the coefficients of <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> continued to increase in recent years inversely with volumes participating in the reduction of water resources in the area and affecting in a pejorative way the groundwater refill...|$|R
