40|$|We {{constrain}} <b>cold</b> dark <b>energy</b> of negligible sound speed using {{galaxy cluster}} abundance observations. In contrast to standard quasi-homogeneous dark energy, negligible sound speed implies clustering {{of the dark}} energy fluid at all scales, allowing us to measure the effects of dark energy perturbations at cluster scales. We compare those models {{and set the stage}} for using non-linear information from semi-analytical modelling in cluster growth data analyses. For this, we recalibrate the halo mass function with non-linear characteristic quantities, the spherical collapse threshold and virial overdensity, that account for model and redshift dependent behaviours, as well as an additional mass contribution for <b>cold</b> dark <b>energy.</b> We present the first constraints from this cold dark matter plus <b>cold</b> dark <b>energy</b> mass function using our cluster abundance likelihood, which self-consistently accounts for selection effects, covariances and systematic uncertainties. We combine cluster growth data with CMB, SNe Ia and BAO data, and find a shift between cold versus quasi-homogeneous dark energy of up to 1 σ. We make a Fisher matrix forecast of constraints attainable with cluster growth data from the on-going Dark Energy Survey (DES). For DES, we predict ∼ 50 % tighter constraints on (Ω_m,w) for <b>cold</b> dark <b>energy</b> versus wCDM models, with the same free parameters. Overall, we show that cluster abundance analyses are sensitive to <b>cold</b> dark <b>energy,</b> an alternative, viable model that should be routinely investigated alongside the standard dark energy scenario.
