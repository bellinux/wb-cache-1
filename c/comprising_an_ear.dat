40|$|Hearing aid for {{improving}} the hearing ability of the hard of hearing, <b>comprising</b> <b>an</b> array of microphones, the electrical output signals of which are fed {{to at least one}} transmission path belonging to <b>an</b> <b>ear.</b> Means are provided for deriving two array output signals from the output signals of the microphones, the array having two main sensitivity directions running at an angle with respect to one another and each of which is associated to an array output signal. Each array output signal is fed to its own transmission path belonging to one <b>ear</b> of <b>a</b> person who is hard of hearing. Applied Science...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} {{relates to}} a bilateral hearing assistance system comprising {{first and second}} hearing assistance devices, {{each of the first}} and second hearing assistance devices being adapted for being located at or in <b>an</b> <b>ear</b> of the user or to be partially or fully implanted in the head at <b>an</b> <b>ear</b> of the user, <b>comprising</b> <b>a</b> processing unit, which in a NORMAL mode of operation is adapted to process an input audio signal based on configurable processing parameters and to provide a processed electric stimulation signal, and <b>comprising</b> <b>an</b> output unit operationally connected to said processing unit in said NORMAL mode of operation and adapted to present an electric stimulation signal input to said user in a form allowing it to be perceived by the user as an auditory signal, the bilateral hearing assistance system further comprising one or more stimulation units for - in a TEST mode of operation of the hearing assistance system - delivering first and second electric TEST stimulation signals to said output units of said first and second hearing assistance devices, respectively. The application further relates to a method of fitting a bilateral hearing assistance system to a particular user. The object of the present application is to provide a measure allowing an improved fitting of bilaterally implanted Cochlear Implant users. The problem is solved in that the bilateral hearing assistance system further <b>comprises</b> <b>an</b> evaluation unit configured to analyze the recorded physiological response of the user and to provide an objective measure of the user's perception of said TEST stimulation signals. This has the advantage of providing an improved speech intelligibility and preservation of spatial cues. The invention may e. g. be used for the fitting of hearing assistance devices comprising cochlear implants...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{adjusting}} a signal processing parameter {{for a first}} hearing aid and a second hearing aid forming parts of a binaural hearing aid system to be worn by a user is provided. The binaural hearing aid system <b>comprises</b> <b>a</b> user specific model representing a desired asymmetry between <b>a</b> first <b>ear</b> and <b>a</b> second <b>ear</b> of the user. The method includes detecting a request for processing a parameter change at the first hearing aid, adjusting the signal processing parameter in the first hearing aid, and adjusting a processing parameter for the second hearing aid based on the request for processing parameter change and the user specific model...|$|R
