5|$|Einarr was the {{youngest}} son of Rognvald Eysteinsson, Earl of Møre, Norway, by a <b>concubine.</b> According to the sagas and the Historia Norvegiae Rognvald's family conquered the Orkney and Shetland islands in the late ninth century. Rognvald's brother, Sigurd Eysteinsson, was made Earl of Orkney and after his death on campaign he was succeeded by his son, Guthorm, who died shortly afterward. Rognvald then sent {{one of his own}} sons, Hallad, to govern the islands.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about Kanhopatra. According to most {{traditional}} accounts, Kanhopatra was a courtesan and dancing-girl. These accounts typically concentrate on her death when she chose to surrender to the Hindu god Vithoba—the patron god of the Varkaris—rather than becoming a <b>concubine</b> of the Badshah (king) of Bidar. She died in the central shrine of Vithoba in Pandharpur. She {{is the only person}} whose samadhi (mausoleum) is within the precincts of the temple.|$|E

50|$|The {{number of}} <b>concubines</b> was {{sometime}} regulated, which differs {{according to the}} men's rank. In ancient China, men of higher social status often supported several <b>concubines,</b> and Chinese emperors almost always have dozens of, even hundreds of royal <b>concubines.</b>|$|R

5|$|Muhammad's life is {{traditionally}} defined into two periods: pre-hijra (emigration) in Mecca (from 570 to 622), and post-hijra in Medina (from 622 until 632). Muhammad {{is said to}} have had thirteen wives in total (although two have ambiguous accounts, Rayhana bint Zayd and Maria al-Qibtiyya, as wife or <b>concubine.)</b> Eleven of the thirteen marriages occurred after the migration to Medina.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese may {{not have}} seen {{intermarriage}} {{between them and the}} royal dynasties of the Korean Empire damaging to their prestige either. According to the Shoku Nihongi, an imperially commissioned record of Japanese history completed in 797, Emperor Kanmu who ruled from 781 to 806 {{was the son of a}} Korean <b>concubine,</b> Takano no Niigasa, who was descended from King Muryeong of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.|$|E
5|$|The empress, {{the legal}} {{wife of the}} emperor, also had {{an area of the}} palace {{separate}} from that of the emperor's private apartments, where the empress was expected to spend every fifth night with the emperor. Both the empress and the heir apparent received an income from the taxes of forty counties. She also had a Supervisor of the Household (ranked 2,000-dan), and many other subordinates, either male eunuchs or female maids, who took care of domestic needs. The concubines of the harem were subordinates of the empress and were ranked below her in fourteen grades by the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han (r. 49–33). However, the founder of Eastern Han abolished the fourteen salary-ranks in favor of three ranks with no definite salary; instead, the concubines were irregularly granted gifts. The chief <b>concubine</b> of Western Han, the Brilliant Companion, shared the same salary-rank as the Chancellor, while the <b>concubine</b> ranked just below her, the Favorite Beauty, shared the same salary-rank as any one of the Nine Ministers.|$|E

50|$|<b>Concubines</b> {{were common}} in pre-Islamic Arabia and when Islam arrived, {{it had a}} society with <b>concubines.</b> Islam {{introduced}} legal restrictions to the concubinage and encouraged manumission. In verse 23:6 in the Quran it is allowed to have sexual intercourse with <b>concubines</b> after marrying them, as Islam forbids sexual intercourse outside of marriage.Children of former <b>concubines</b> were generally declared as legitimate as they were born in wedlock, {{and the mother of}} a free child was considered free upon the death of the male partner.|$|R
5|$|A dandy, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești himself led {{a life of}} luxury, {{marked by}} excess, and had by then become a drug addict. He was a proud {{homosexual}} (or bisexual), which did not prevent him from keeping as his <b>concubine</b> a younger woman, {{commonly referred to as}} Domnica ("Little Lady") or Mica ("Little One"). Born Alexandra Colanoski, she was born in 1894 to Romanian Poles from Bessarabia, and, according to memoirist Constantin Beldie, had previously been a prostitute at a nightclub.|$|E
5|$|According to Thietmar, Bolesław asked Yaroslav {{to return}} his daughter, whom Yaroslav had taken prisoner. As Yaroslav refused, Bolesław took members of Yaroslav's family to Poland as prisoners when he {{returned}} to his country in September. His captives included Vladimir's widow and Yaroslav's sister, Predslava, whose hand Bolesław had sought earlier. Having been rebuffed, Bolesław now took her as a <b>concubine.</b> The Polish duke also took some commoners as well as much of the treasury of Kiev. Among the notable commoners was the venerated Saint Moses the Hungarian.|$|E
5|$|Alessandro Farnese, as Paul III, was {{the last}} of the popes {{appointed}} by the ruling Medici family of Florence. He was socially ambitious, a careerist and not particularly pious. He kept a <b>concubine,</b> fathered four children out of wedlock and viewed the throne as an opportunity to fill his coffers while he placed his relatives in high positions. A talented and cunning political operator, Paul was precisely the sort of man the Florentines needed to assist them in their defence against French and Spanish threats.|$|E
50|$|In premodern China, it {{was illegal}} and {{socially}} disreputable {{for a man to}} have more than one wife at a time, but he could have <b>concubines.</b> At first a man could have as many <b>concubines</b> as he could afford, however, from the Eastern Han (AD 25-220) onward, the maximal number of <b>concubines</b> a man could have was limited by law. The higher ranking and the more noble an identity a man possessed, the more <b>concubines</b> he was permitted to have.|$|R

Their happy life is {{disturbed}} after the delman driver Samioen {{falls in love with}} Dasima, despite already being married to Hajati. He attempts to use magic (goena-goena) to win her heart, and asks an egg merchant, Mak Boejoeng, to frighten Dasima by telling the young woman that she has committed the sin of zina (extramarital sex).|$|E
5|$|During {{this same}} time, however, Sadashiva—who felt insulted by Kanhopatra's refusal—sought {{the help of}} the Badshah (king) of Bidar. Hearing tales of Kanhopatra's beauty, the Badshah ordered her to be his <b>concubine.</b> When she refused, the king sent his men to get her by force. Kanhopatra took refuge in the Vithoba temple. The {{soldiers}} of the king besieged the temple and threatened to destroy it if Kanhopatra was not handed over to them. Kanhopatra requested a last meeting with Vithoba before being taken.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the more}} {{well-known}} stories about Sun Tzu, taken from Sima Qian, illustrates Sun Tzu's temperament as follows: Before hiring Sun Tzu, the King of Wu tested Sun Tzu's skills by commanding him to train a harem of 180 <b>concubines</b> into soldiers. Sun Tzu divided them into two companies, appointing the two <b>concubines</b> most favored by the king as the company commanders. When Sun Tzu first ordered the <b>concubines</b> to face right, they giggled. In response, Sun Tzu said that the general, in this case himself, was responsible for ensuring that soldiers understood the commands given to them. Then, he reiterated the command, and again the <b>concubines</b> giggled. Sun Tzu then ordered {{the execution of the}} king's two favored <b>concubines,</b> to the king's protests. He explained that if the general's soldiers understood their commands but did not obey, it was the fault of the officers. Sun Tzu also said that, once a general was appointed, it was his duty to carry out his mission, even if the king protested. After both <b>concubines</b> were killed, new officers were chosen to replace them. Afterwards, both companies, now well aware of the costs of further frivolity, performed their maneuvers flawlessly.|$|R
50|$|Emperor Wen is also {{famous for}} having the fewest number of <b>concubines</b> for an adult Chinese emperor. (Emperor Fei of Western Wei and the Ming dynasty Hongzhi Emperor {{were the only two}} perpetually monogamous Chinese emperors.) Emperor Wen was known for having only two <b>concubines</b> (although he might have had {{additional}} <b>concubines</b> not documented by traditional historians), with whom he might not have had sexual relations until after the death in 602 of his wife Empress Dugu, whom he loved and respected deeply.|$|R
5|$|Eardwulf {{was evidently}} married {{before he became}} king, as Alcuin reproached him for abandoning his wife for a <b>concubine</b> soon after his coronation. This {{strained}} relations with the new Archbishop Eanbald II—Eanbald I {{had died in the}} year of Eardwulf's coronation. Alcuin, while condemning secular oppression of the church, affected surprise that while the Archbishop Eanbald was travelling he was accompanied by a large retinue, including soldiers, and that he received and protected the king's enemies. Eanbald was presumably in conflict with Eardwulf over property, but it is likely that he also supported rivals for Eardwulf's throne.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, García Márquez {{published}} the memoir Vivir para contarla, {{the first of}} a projected three-volume autobiography. Edith Grossman's English translation, Living to Tell the Tale, was published in November 2003. October 2004 brought the publication of a novel, Memories of My Melancholy Whores (Memoria de mis putas tristes), a love story that follows the romance of a 90-year-old man and a pubescent <b>concubine.</b> Memories of My Melancholy Whores caused controversy in Iran, where it was banned after an initial 5,000 copies were printed and sold.|$|E
5|$|In {{her early}} to mid-thirties, {{she became a}} lady-in-waiting (nyōbō) at court, most likely because of her {{reputation}} as an author. Chieko Mulhern writes in Japanese Women Writers, a Biocritical Sourcebook that scholars have wondered why Murasaki made such a move at a comparatively late period in her life. Her diary evidences that she exchanged poetry with Michinaga after her husband's death, leading to speculation that the two may have been lovers. Bowring sees no evidence that she was brought to court as Michinaga's <b>concubine,</b> although he did bring her to court without following official channels. Mulhern thinks Michinaga wanted to have Murasaki at court to educate his daughter Shōshi.|$|E
50|$|Emperors' <b>concubines</b> and harems are {{emphasized}} in 21st-century romantic novels written for female readers {{and set in}} ancient times. As a plot element, the children of <b>concubines</b> are depicted with a status much inferior to that in actual history. The zhai dou (residential intrigue) and gong dou (harem intrigue) genres show <b>concubines</b> and wives, {{as well as their}} children, scheming secretly to access power. Empresses in the Palace, a gong dou type novel and TV drama, has had great success in 21st-century China.|$|R
50|$|The {{relationship}} between Yang Yong and Empress Dugu also became strained, as Empress Dugu disfavored {{men who had}} many <b>concubines</b> (so much so that Emperor Wen did not have many <b>concubines</b> {{while she was still}} alive, and might not have had sexual relations even with the few <b>concubines</b> that he had during her lifetime), but Yang Yong, who did not favor his wife Crown Princess Yuan, had many <b>concubines,</b> particularly favoring the beautiful Consort Yun. Crown Princess Yuan, who did not have any sons with Yang Yong, died suddenly in 591, apparently from a heart ailment, but both Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu suspected foul play, and Empress Dugu particularly rebuked him. After Crown Princess Yuan's death, Consort Yun became effective mistress over the Crown Prince's palace, and she and the other <b>concubines</b> bore Yang Yong 10 sons in total, which made Empress Dugu exceedingly displeased, as she was even more displeased at men having children with their <b>concubines.</b> Yang Guang, who had ambitions of replacing Yang Yong, was meanwhile gaining the favors of both Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu by pretending to be frugal and loving only his wife Princess Xiao, which caused Emperor Wen and Empress Dugu to be further displeased with Yang Yong, by comparison.|$|R

The furious Akhilles refuses to continue fighting. Menelaus and Paris duel each other, but Paris flees the fight due to the intervention of Helen and Aphrodite.|$|E
5|$|The episode also {{marks the}} upgrade of several {{returning}} characters {{to the main}} cast. John Bradley-West returns as Jon Snow's friend Sam Tarly, James Cosmo as the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch Jeor Mormont, Jerome Flynn as Tyrion's cunning servant Bronn, with Sibel Kekilli as Tyrion's <b>concubine</b> Shae, and lastly Conleth Hill as the gossiping eunuch Varys. Peter Dinklage {{takes the place of}} Sean Bean as the first credit during the intro sequence.

40|$|The monogamous {{system was}} {{specified}} in both Civil Code and Penal Code which were enacted in the 20 th century in China. However, the word “concubine” {{was not used}} in them, and concubinage was never banned either. This fact has raised the arguments over <b>concubines.</b> Some jurists and the noted-cases acknowledged concubinage. Moreover, they thought little of the penalization for a husband who had {{a sexual relationship with}} <b>concubines.</b> However, after the arguments about legal issues over <b>concubines,</b> some members of women’s organizations gave a statement that concubinage should be banned. In conclusion, even after the monogamous system was specified in the Codes, the relationship between a husband and his <b>concubines</b> was not regarded as marriage, which resulted in the co-existence of monogamy with concubinage in modern China...|$|R
25|$|Polygyny where {{wives are}} of equal status {{had always been}} illegal in China, and had been {{considered}} a crime in some dynasties. In family laws from Tang to Qing Dynasties, {{the status of a}} wife, <b>concubines</b> and maid-mistresses couldn't be altered. However, concubinage was supported by law {{until the end of the}} Qing/Ching dynasty of the imperial China (1911). In the past, Emperors could and often did have hundreds to thousands of <b>concubines.</b> Rich officials and merchants of the elite also took <b>concubines</b> in addition to legal wives. The first wife was the head or mother wife; other wives were under her headship if the husband was away. <b>Concubines</b> had a lower status than full wives, generally not being seen in public with their husband and not having rights to decisions in the house. Children from <b>concubines</b> were considered inferior to those of the wife and did not receive equal wealth/legacy from their father. However they were considered legitimate, therefore had many more rights to inheritance of status and wealth than illegitimate children conceived outside a marriage.|$|R
