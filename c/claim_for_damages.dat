Daniel Nosek's father, however, testified that the family has not been contacted by anyone from the band nor by the defense team. Nosek's father confirmed that his son had been healthy up until the day of the incident. The Nosek family's representative brought a <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> in the amount of CZK 10,000,000 (approx. US$530,000).|$|E

It established — without a separate trial for a private law claim — that Wiens {{has an obligation to}} compensate Okaz and El-Sherbini's beneficiaries for having harmed Okaz and killed El-Sherbini.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Jones {{brought a}} <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> for {{professional}} negligence against Kaney, {{on the basis}} that the personal injury claim had had to be settled for considerably less than would have been the case had Kaney not signed a document that apparently did not reflect her views. Kaney applied to strike out the claim before filing a defence, {{on the basis that}} the claim could not possibly succeed given the binding authority of the Court of Appeal decision of Stanton v Callaghan in 1998 that expert witnesses could not be sued for negligence when preparing a joint statement with the opposing side's expert witness.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, {{authorities}} arrested 16 {{persons and}} prosecuted another 27 persons for alleged NSL violations.

At {{the end of the}} year he was awaiting trial without physical detention. In another case four members of a nongovernmental organization (NGO) were detained and charged in September with illegal contact with Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) agents and distribution of North Korean press material for the purpose of exalting DPRK leader Kim Jong-il. The NGO claimed the government used falsehoods against the four and filed a defamation <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages.</b> At year's end the four were in detention awaiting trial, and the defamation claim had not been settled.|$|E
25|$|When Arkansas {{became a}} {{territory}} in 1819 {{there were several}} thousand Indians living in the area. Early Arkansas settlers perceived these Indians as dangerous savages. Most of the tribes, the Quapaw, Caddo, and Cherokee, were in actuality quiet and peaceful. Problems also ensued along the Territorial boundary with the Indian nation, with whites and Indians each wandering across the ill defined border. The first recorded clash between the Territorial Militia and Native Americans apparently occurred in 1820. Captain George Gray, Indian Agent for the Cherokee Nation at Sulphur Fork, wrote to Secretary of War John C. Calhoun regarding a claim by the Cherokee Nation {{that they had been}} driven from a village along the Red River by two companies of the Arkansas Militia. No records exist indicating whether this action was directed by the territorial governor or was done under the control of local authorities. Calhoun responded to the claim and stated that he lacked sufficient evidence to approve the Cherokee <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> resulting from the loss of their villages but pointed out that he could not protect Cherokees if they established villages in areas assigned to whites by treaty.|$|E

25|$|The River Ant was navigable to Dilham {{prior to}} 1810, when {{consideration}} {{was given to}} extending navigation northwards along {{the course of the}} river. Plans were drawn up by William Youard and John Millington in 1811 {{and it was one of}} Millington's two plan that formed the basis of a bill presented to Parliament in early 1812. It was opposed by the inhabitants of Worstead and Dilham, who feared that their businesses would collapse if boats could reach North Walsham, but the navigation was nevertheless authorised by an Act of Parliament dated 5 May 1812, which created the Company of Proprietors of the North Walsham and Dilham Canal Navigation. They had powers to raise £30,000 by the issuing of shares, and a further £10,000 if required, either from shares or by mortgage. Work on the construction of the canal did not start until 1825, with some of the delays caused by a <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> made by Issac Harris Lewis, who owned his own staithe at Dilham and felt that the new canal would damage his trade. His case was heard in April 1825 and he was awarded £1,500 in compensation. Work began in the same month, employing 100 men from Bedfordshire.|$|E

500|$|Gregory G. Garre, Assistant Solicitor General {{argued the}} case for the United States. As the petitioner, Garre argued that the 1960 act did not authorize {{monetary}} damages for a breach of trust duties. Their position was that while a trust was formed, the tribe could not make a <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> without explicit congressional authorization. Further, he argued, the exclusive control does not create liability; only the explicit language of statutes and regulations could allow monetary damages. The position of the United States was that [...] "in trust" [...] meant was that the land was not subject to alienation or to state taxation.|$|E
