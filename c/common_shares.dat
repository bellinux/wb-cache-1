25|$|ABS-CBN Corporation, {{commonly}} known as ABS-CBN, is a Filipino media and entertainment group based in Quezon City. It is the Philippines' largest entertainment and media conglomerate in terms of revenue, operating income, assets, equity, market capitalization, and number of employees. ABS-CBN was formed by the merger of Alto Broadcasting System and Chronicle Broadcasting Network. It was founded in 1946 by Jewish American electronics engineer James Lindenberg and Judge Antonio Quirino (the brother of the sixth Philippine President Elpidio Quirino) as Bolinao Electronics Corporation (BEC). In 1952, BEC was renamed Alto Broadcasting System (ABS). Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN), on the other hand, was founded in 1952 by newspaper mogul Don Eugenio Lopez, Sr. and his brother Fernando Lopez (the Philippine Vice President for three terms from 1949 to 1953 and 1965 to 1973). The two companies were merged and incorporated as ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation on February 1, 1967, and renamed as ABS-CBN Corporation in 2010 to reflect the company's diversification. The <b>common</b> <b>shares</b> of ABS-CBN was first traded on the Philippine Stock Exchange in July 1992 under the ticker symbol ABS.|$|E

25|$|When {{a company}} lists its {{securities}} {{on a public}} exchange, the money paid by the investing public for then newly issued shares goes directly to the company (primary offering) {{as well as to}} any early private investors who opt to sell all or a portion of their holdings (secondary offerings) as part of the larger IPO. An IPO, therefore, allows a company to tap into a wide pool of potential investors to provide itself with capital for future growth, repayment of debt, or working capital. A company selling <b>common</b> <b>shares</b> is never required to repay the capital to its public investors. Those investors must endure the unpredictable nature of the open market to price and trade their shares. After the IPO, when shares trade freely in the open market, money passes between public investors. For early private investors who choose to sell shares as part of the IPO process, the IPO represents an opportunity to monetize their investment. After the IPO, once shares trade in the open market, investors holding large blocks of shares can either sell those shares piecemeal in the open market, or sell a large block of shares directly to the public, at a fixed price, through a secondary market offering. This type of offering is not dilutive, since no new shares are being created.|$|E
25|$|On February 27, 2009, Citigroup {{announced}} that the U.S. government would take a 36% equity {{stake in the company}} by converting US$25 billion in emergency aid into common stock with a United States Treasury credit line of $45 billion to prevent the bankruptcy of the company. The government guaranteed losses on more than $300 billion of troubled assets and injected $20 billion immediately into the company. The salary of the CEO was set at $1 per year and the highest salary of employees was restricted to $500,000. Any compensation amount above $500,000 had to be paid with restricted stock that could not be sold by the employee until the emergency government aid was repaid in full. The U.S. government also gained control of half the seats in the Board of Directors, and the senior management was subjected to removal by the US government if there were poor performance. By December 2009, the U.S. government stake was reduced from a 36% stake to a 27% stake, after Citigroup sold $21 billion of <b>common</b> <b>shares</b> and equity in the largest single share sale in U.S. history, surpassing Bank of America's $19 billion share sale 1 month prior. By December 2010, Citigroup repaid the emergency aid in full and the U.S. government had made a $12 billion profit on its investment in the company. Government restrictions on pay and oversight of the senior management were removed after the U.S. government sold its remaining 27% stake in December 2010.|$|E
500|$|The {{company was}} {{constantly}} emphasizing its stock price. Management was compensated extensively using stock options, {{similar to other}} U.S. companies.

The stock ticker was located in lobbies, elevators, and on company computers. At budget meetings, Skilling would develop target earnings by asking [...] "What earnings do you need to keep our stock price up?" [...] and that number would be used, even if it was not feasible. On December 31, 2000, Enron had 96 million shares outstanding as stock option plans (approximately 13% of <b>common</b> <b>shares</b> outstanding). Enron's proxy statement stated that, within three years, these awards were expected to be exercised.
