5|$|Fried chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried <b>chicken</b> <b>from</b> other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.|$|E

40|$|Lysine is {{typically}} the second-limiting amino acid in poultry diets. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the effects of dietary lysine concentration on carcass and meat quality traits, and serum parameters in two lines – SD 02 and SD 03 – which originated from a Chinese local breed, the Erlang Mountainous chicken. Live body weight, carcass traits, meat quality traits (myofibre diameter and density), and serum metabolic markers were measured in high and low dietary lysine groups (HL and LL, respectively) at the end of the starter (1 - 28 days), grower (29 - 49 days) and finisher (50 - 70 days) periods. The results showed that mortality, live weight (LW), myofibre diameter of leg muscle (LFDM) and serum cholesterol (CHO) were greater in HL than LL (P< 0. 05). The <b>chickens</b> <b>from</b> HL had reduced subcutaneous fat thickness and heart weight than LL (P< 0. 05). The <b>chickens</b> <b>from</b> line SD 02 had greater leg muscle weight, myofibre diameter in breast, and LFDM than line SD 03 (P< 0. 05). The <b>chickens</b> <b>from</b> line SD 02 had more serum urea nitrogen and less total proteins than line SD 03 (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, high lysine diets improved slaughter performance and muscle fibre diameter, and SD 02 chickens had greater carcass yield and superior meat quality compared with <b>chickens</b> <b>from</b> line SD 03...|$|R

40|$|Summary This study {{sought to}} assess {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) diversity and phylogeographic structure of <b>chickens</b> <b>from</b> five agro-ecological zones of Zimbabwe. Furthermore, <b>chickens</b> <b>from</b> Zimbabwe were compared with populations from other geographical regions (Malawi, Sudan and Germany) and other management systems (broiler and layer purebred lines). Finally, haplotypes of these animals were aligned to <b>chicken</b> sequences, taken <b>from</b> Gen-Bank, that reflected populations of presumed centres of domestication. A 455 -bp fragment of the mtDNA D-loop region was sequenced in 283 chickens of 14 populations. Thirty-two variable sites that defined 34 haplotypes were observed. In Zimbabwean chickens, diversity within ecotypes accounted for 96. 8 % of the variation, indicating little differentiation between ecotypes. The 34 haplotypes clustered into three clades that corresponded to (i) Zimbabwean and Malawian chickens, (ii) broiler and layer purebred lines and Northwest European chickens, and (iii) a mixture of <b>chickens</b> <b>from</b> Zimbabwe, Sudan, Northwest Europe and the purebred lines. Diversity among clades explained more than 80 % of the total variation. Results indicated the existence of two distinct maternal lineages evenly distrib-uted among the five Zimbabwean chicken ecotypes. For one of these lineages, <b>chickens</b> <b>from</b> Zimbabwe and Malawi shared major haplotypes with chicken populations that have a Southeast Asian background. The second maternal lineage, probably from the Indian subcontinent, was common to the five Zimbabwean chicken ecotypes, Sudanese and Northwest European chickens as well as purebred broiler and layer chicken lines. A third maternal lineage excluded Zimbabwean and other African chickens and clustered with haplotypes presumably originating from South China...|$|R
