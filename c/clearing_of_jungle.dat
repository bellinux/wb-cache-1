5000|$|Cochran, by now a Lieutenant Colonel, and John R. Alison (former deputy {{commander}} of the 75th Fighter Squadron) were picked by General Hap Arnold as co-commanders of the 1st USAAF Air Commando Group. [...] (While there an informal agreement existed between Cochran and Alison over who was effectively Commander Cochran and Deputy Commander Alison, this arrangement was unofficial. To this day, USAF records indicate Col Cochran and Col Alison as 'co-commanders'.) The 1st Air Commando, among other missions, was assigned the task of supporting Allied Long Range Penetration Groups, of the British Army's Chindits, invading Japanese-held Burma. Some of these forces were designated to fly in by towed gliders; all required resupply by regular airdrops during their missions, as well as air support. Under Cochran's command, the 1st Air Commando's C-47 pilots perfected the tactic of snatching loaded gliders from small areas <b>of</b> ground <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> <b>jungle</b> vegetation into the air using stretchable nylon ropes, all while flying at 15 to 30 feet using breaks in the jungle canopy. [...] Upon witnessing one of these demonstrations, the Allied theater commander, Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten exclaimed, [...] "Jesus Christ All Bloody Mighty!" ...|$|R
50|$|The Isla de Coiba {{has been}} {{the site of the}} Coiba Penal Colony, Panama's most severe prison, since 1919. Although most of its prisoners are sentenced by courts to {{specified}} terms, sometimes persons were sent to Coiba while awaiting the results of pretrial investigation or awaiting sentencing, a violation of judicial regulations, if, as indicated in the criminal code, Coiba was the most severe regime in the prison system. The prisoners are housed in a main camp and in several small camps scattered about the island, but {{there is no indication that}} pretrial detainees were segregated from prisoners serving sentences. In the main camp, there are some facilities for rehabilitation training and a small school; however, many of the inmates have little or no access to those facilities because they live some distance from the main camp. Work is required of all prisoners including those awaiting trial or awaiting sentencing. Labor is unremunerated for the majority of prisoners, most of whom are engaged in farming and animal husbandry in areas that they or former prisoners had <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> <b>jungle</b> growth. Some mechanics and other skilled craftsmen receive small wages for their labor.|$|R
50|$|The German group Gesellschaft für bedrohte Völker criticized {{her first}} book, {{claiming}} that it romanticized {{the life of}} the Fayu and pointing out that it failed to mention the human rights violations of the Indonesian government against Papua peoples, and their endangerment by <b>clearing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>jungle</b> and industrial projects. In her second book and in public appearances, Sabine Kuegler was able to emphasize these political issues, her parents having left West Papua in 2006, enabling her to go public with her political activities. She has aimed to be a spokesperson for the threatened Fayu.|$|R
50|$|Starting with a work crew {{of twelve}} full-blood Cherokees, the initial effort {{involved}} selective <b>clearing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>jungle</b> <b>of</b> vines, bushes and trees which covered the entire site, and filling the sink holes {{that had a}} century before been a small basement under the old Cherokee seminary building, as well as excavating and salvaging foundation rock from the old seminary for later use. The force soon grew to four crews with up to 52 Cherokees employed. Village construction actually started in May 1966 and continued for over a year. Hand labor, native materials, and ancient methods were used {{in order to create}} the most authentic atmosphere possible.|$|R
50|$|After {{the end of}} the war in May 2009 the {{residents}} of the village, along with most of Mullaitivu District, were held by the Sri Lankan military internment camps in Vavuniya District. Much of eastern Mullaitivu District including Ananthapuram were declared as High Security Zone and were out of bounds to the public. This meant that when the census took place in March 2012 there were only three residents in Ananthapuram GN Division. Resettlement in the GN Division began in September 2012 and by February 2013 the population was 735. However, many of Ananthapuram's residents weren't resettled in their own homes but in newly <b>cleared</b> areas <b>of</b> <b>jungles.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Korean and Vietnam Wars {{brought about}} new {{technology}} for engineers to adapt to. Guerilla warfare on opposing sides {{in addition to}} unfamiliar territories and diverse, treacherous topography of foreign land required more mapping and logistic skills than before.

50|$|Francis Light, {{the founder}} of Penang, {{was said to have}} arrived in Jerejak Island in early 1786 before heading on to Penang. In 1797, Colonel Arthur Wellesley had {{proposed}} Jerejak as the possible site for Fort Cornwallis. His idea of establishing a military post in Jerejak was to offer protection to a new township called Jamestown, which was to be set up in present-day Bayan Lepas. Earlier in 1794, there had been an outbreak of malaria caused most likely by the <b>clearing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>jungle</b> to establish George Town, claiming many lives, including Francis Light himself. Thus, Wellesley was not in favour of the site for Fort Cornwallis to be on Penang island.|$|R
60|$|This {{seems the}} only {{expedient}} at {{hand for the}} temporary maintenance of European peace, with its alliances based on mutual distrust, preparedness for war as its ideal, {{and the fear of}} wounds, luckily stronger, so far, than the pinch of hunger, its only guarantee. The true peace of the world will be a place of refuge much less like a beleaguered fortress and more, let us hope, in the nature of an Inviolable Temple. It will be built on less perishable foundations than those of material interests. But it must be confessed that the architectural aspect of the universal city remains as yet inconceivable--that the very ground for its erection has not been <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> the <b>jungle.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The first archeologists {{reached the}} site in the early 20th century and {{included}} Teobert Maler, Edward Seler, Francisco del Paso y Troncoso and Herbert and Ellen Spinden. [...] With the discovery {{of oil in the}} area came roads that were built and improved from the 1920s to the 1940s. This allowed for more intensive investigation of the area. In 1935-38 the first formal mapping, clearing and exploration was done by Agustin Garcia Vega. [...] The first building to be completely <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> <b>jungle</b> growth was the Pyramid of the Niches. He eventually cleared , uncovering more buildings and proposed that it be called “The Archeological City of El Tajín.” Starting from 1938, excavation and reconstruction work was sponsored by INAH and headed by Jose Garcia Payon, uncovering platforms, ballcourts and part of Tajín Chico with its palaces. [...] He continued to explore the site for 39 years until his death in 1977 despite the challenges of working in the jungle and the lack of funds. By this time, he had uncovered most of the major buildings and established that Tajín {{was one of the most}} important cities of ancient Mexico. By the 1970s, the site was one of the few in Veracruz state that attracted significant numbers of tourists. From 1984 to 1994, Jürgen K. Brüggemann built on the work of García Payón, uncovering 35 more buildings. It is believed that only half of El Tajin archeological site has been uncovered.|$|R

50|$|One {{proposed}} {{site for}} the training base was at Pulau Ubin. However, the suggestion was dropped {{for a number of}} reasons.

50|$|In May 1850, {{the first}} {{preparations}} were begun on Manzanillo Island, {{and the start}} of the roadway was partially <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> trees and <b>jungle</b> on the mainland. Very quickly, the difficulty of the scheme became apparent. The initial 8 mi of the proposed route passed through a <b>jungle</b> <b>of</b> gelatinous swamps infested with alligators, the heat was stifling, mosquitoes and sand flies were everywhere, and deluges of up to 3 yd of rain for almost half the year required some workers to work in swamp water up to four feet deep. When they tried to build a railroad near Aspinwall, the swamps were apparently endlessly deep, often requiring over 200 feet (60 m) of gravel backfill to secure a roadbed. Fortunately they had found a quarry near Porto Bello, Panama, so they could load sandstone onto barges and tow it to Aspinwall to get the backfill needed to build the roadbed.|$|R

When Captain Nim interrogates him, he discovers a silver Zippo lighter in the ARVN soldier's possession. The lighter belonged to a Green Beret medical specialist, a friend of Kirby's, recently murdered by the VC. After Beckworth sees Nim torture the Viet Cong suspect to get a confession from him, he confronts Kirby about it. The Colonel justifies the interrogation by telling Beckworth about the cigarette lighter, and says the VC are ruthless killers who deserve no legal protections of any sort in this new kind of war.|$|R
50|$|To {{restrict}} guerrilla activity, the Vietnamese {{erected a}} physical barrier on the Thai-Cambodian border. Code-named Project K-5, the effort consisted <b>of</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>jungle</b> growth; <b>of</b> erecting obstacles, such as ditches, barbed wire, and minefields; and {{of building a}} road parallel to the border. Construction of the project, which began in 1985, was performed by corvée labour. All districts in Cambodia were tasked to provide able-bodied males for tours of duty on the project that ranged from three to six months. Living conditions were primitive in the construction camps, and the diet was inadequate; the area was malarial, and unexploded ordnance from past conflicts was a constant threat. The barrier was completed in 1987 at an unrecorded cost in Cambodian lives. Preliminary indications shortly thereafter revealed that it was having little effect on guerrilla movements {{to and from the}} Cambodian interior.|$|R

When his artistic career {{came to an end}} with the Nazi takeover in 1933, he became a house painter and learned the craft of producing imitation marble, both skills that secured him a visa to Bolivia in 1939. He was able to establish himself as a painter, engraver and art conservator and translator. He gave lectures and poetry readings of his own work, for some time had his own radio program and helped university professors translate difficult German writings by Heidegger and other philosophers. Halbers continued to pursue his art career after settling in New York in 1954 and became a specialist in restoring pre-Columbian art. For his retirement he moved to Argentina in 1969.

Over the next three months they would fire over 37,000 rounds in support of the 26th Brigade's three infantry battalions; this included rounds from a captured Japanese 75mm mountain gun.
