50|$|In 1867 Hick first {{published}} a paper, reprinted from The Engineer, 1 June 1866, Experiments on the Friction of the Leather Collars in Hydraulic Presses, that expanded {{on the work}} of Dr William Rankine, describing an important series of experiments carried out using a joint invention of Hick and Robert Lüthy (1840-1883), a Swiss engineer employed by Hick, and inventor of a hydraulic <b>cotton</b> <b>packing</b> press. Hick's father was the inventor of the self tightening collar, used universally in hydraulic pressess.|$|E
40|$|Can topical {{tranexamic}} acid {{be used for}} spontaneous epistaxis in otherwise healthy patients? Evidence-Based Answer: Possibly. Cotton nasal packing soaked with {{tranexamic acid}} solution {{appears to be more}} effective than epinephrine and lidocaine-soaked <b>cotton</b> <b>packing</b> for epistaxis treatment, whereas tranexamic acid gel is no better than placebo. Patient satisfaction is higher and emergency department length of stay is 2 hours less with tranexamic nasal packing (SOR: B, single RCTs) ...|$|E
40|$|Oxygen {{transfer}} {{through a}} cotton plug follows Fick's law of diffusion. The apparent diffusion constant decreases as {{the density of}} <b>cotton</b> <b>packing</b> is increased. Formulas are derived which relate oxygen transfer to cotton-plug dimensions. Calculations indicate that the dimensions of a cotton plug can affect both the maximal oxygen uptake rate and the gas composition inside a shaken flask. In some situations, as with large flasks, the cotton closure can become the limiting factor to aeration...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe new cavity created {{after an}} open cavity tympanomastoidectomy (OCTM) {{is filled with}} an {{antibiotic}} impregnated <b>cotton</b> <b>pack</b> (<b>cotton</b> tape, umbilical tape, gauze). The removal of this pack usually causes some bleeding and discomfort for the patient. We propose {{the use of a}} latex biomembrane to cover the cavity, which will act as an interface between the raw bone surface and the packing. Study design: clinical prospective. Aim: To study the performance of the latex biomembrane as an interface between the raw bone surface and the pack, and to analyze its role in cavity epithelization. Material and Methods: 64 ears of patients submitted to OCTM were studied. The biomembrane was used in the packing of 54 ears and in the 10 remaining ears the regular <b>cotton</b> tape <b>packing</b> was used. Results: In the majority of the cases where the biomembrane was used the packing was removed much easier with no bleeding or pain for the patient and also showed an earlier cavity epithelization. Conclusion: The use of the latex biomembrane has proven to be an effective method to cover the mastoid cavity facilitating epithelization and removal of mastoid cavity packing...|$|R
60|$|By the 1st of July our {{approaches}} {{had reached}} the enemy's ditch {{at a number of}} places. At ten points we could move under cover to within from five to one hundred yards of the enemy. Orders were given to make all preparations for assault on the 6th of July. The debouches were ordered widened to afford easy egress, while the approaches were also to be widened to admit the troops to pass through four abreast. Plank, and bags filled with <b>cotton</b> <b>packed</b> in tightly, were ordered prepared, to enable the troops to cross the ditches.|$|R
25|$|Human {{interaction}} with objects {{poses a threat}} of accidental contamination. Moisture and oils from human skin can cause staining of organic materials and corrosion of metals. This risk can be mitigated through implemented handling protocols such as washing hands and wearing protective gloves to minimize direct contact. Objects may also be enclosed in protective casing to further reduce direct handling when possible. Proper storage techniques, {{such as the use}} of neutral tissue or untreated <b>cotton</b> <b>packed</b> in polyethylene sheeting or acid-free corrugated cardboard, may be used to individually wrap pieces to prevent accidental contamination of objects between handling and display. Storage and display cases should be carefully evaluated for off-gassing risks, and following storage procedures such as those outlined above will all reduce the risk of contaminant damage to objects.|$|R
50|$|The {{first use}} of cannons as siege machine at the siege of Sijilmasa in 1274, {{according}} to 14th-century historian Ibn Khaldun.The Sahelian military consisted of cavalry and infantry. Cavalry consisted of shielded, mounted soldiers. Body armor was chain mail or heavy quilted cotton. Helmets were made of leather, elephant, or hippo hide. Imported horses were shielded. Horse armor consisted of quilted <b>cotton</b> <b>packed</b> with kapok fiber and copper face plate. The stirrups {{could be used as}} weapon to disembowel enemy infantry or mounted soldiers at close range. Weapons included the sword, lance, battle-axe, and broad-bladed spear. The infantry were armed with bow and iron tipped arrows. Iron tips were usually laced with poison, from the West African plant Strophantus hispidus. Quivers of 40-50 arrows would be carried into battle. Later, muskets were introduced.|$|R

60|$|Of {{merchandise}} {{we passed}} very little, the Ganges being still {{the high road}} between north-west India and Bengal. Occasionally a string of camels was seen, but, owing to the damp climate, these are rare, and unknown east of the meridian of Calcutta. A little <b>cotton,</b> clumsily <b>packed</b> in ragged bags, dirty, and deteriorating every day, even at this dry season, proves in how bad a state it must arrive at the market during the rains, when the low wagons are dragged through the streams.|$|R
60|$|How, then, {{with the}} friendless emigrants, stowed away like bales of <b>cotton,</b> and <b>packed</b> like slaves in a slave-ship; {{confined}} {{in a place}} that, during storm time, must be closed against both light and air; who can do no cooking, nor warm {{so much as a}} cup of water; for the drenching seas would instantly flood their fire in their exposed galley on deck? How, then, with these men, and women, and children, to whom a first voyage, under the most advantageous circumstances, must come just as hard as to the Honorable De Lancey Fitz Clarence, lady, daughter, and seventeen servants.|$|R
60|$|Before this I {{had been}} collecting, from St. Louis and Chicago, yawls and barges {{to be used}} as ferries when we got below. By the 16th of April Porter was ready to start on his perilous trip. The advance, {{flagship}} Benton, Porter commanding, started at ten o'clock at night, followed at intervals of a few minutes by the Lafayette with a captured steamer, the Price, lashed to her side, the Louisville, Mound City, Pittsburgh and Carondelet--all of these being naval vessels. Next came the transports --Forest Queen, Silver Wave and Henry Clay, each towing barges loaded with coal {{to be used as}} fuel by the naval and transport steamers when below the batteries. The gunboat Tuscumbia brought up the rear. Soon after the start a battery between Vicksburg and Warrenton opened fire across the intervening peninsula, followed by the upper batteries, and then by batteries all along the line. The gunboats ran up close under the bluffs, delivering their fire in return at short distances, probably without much effect. They were under fire {{for more than two hours}} and every vessel was struck many times, but with little damage to the gunboats. The transports did not fare so well. The Henry Clay was disabled and deserted by her crew. Soon after a shell burst in the <b>cotton</b> <b>packed</b> about the boilers, set the vessel on fire and burned her to the water's edge. The burning mass, however, floated down to Carthage before grounding, as did also one of the barges in tow.|$|R
50|$|Excavations {{directed}} by Ernst Herzfeld at Persepolis between 1933 and 1934 for the Oriental Institute, discovered {{tens of thousands}} of unbaked clay tablets, badly broken fragments and bullae in March 1933. Before attempting to build a pathway for easy removal of debris from the ruins of palaces on the Persepolis terrace, Herzfeld decided to excavate the location first to ensure that building a passage would not harm anything. He found two rooms filled up with clay tablets that were arranged in order, as in a library. The uncleaned tablets and fragments were covered up with wax and after drying, they were wrapped up in <b>cotton</b> and <b>packed</b> in 2,353 sequentially numbered boxes for shipping.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{estimated}} that the Early Classic Tikal's population of roughly 45,000 consumed approximately 131.4 tons of salt annually. Not only is it required in diet, {{but it can also}} be used as a preservative. Salt was also frequently used for ritual and medicinal purposes. It is also believed that salt was commonly used during childbirth and death. A midwife would offer salt to both parents at birth and a saline solution was sprinkled throughout the house following the death of a family member. Veterans of battle often wore armor, consisting of short <b>cotton</b> jackets <b>packed</b> with rock salt—the equivalent of the modern [...] "flack jacket" [...] and tight bindings of leather or cloth on forearms and legs. Cotton armor is so much more effective than any other protection.|$|R
50|$|Sultanhisar is an {{agricultural}} {{district in the}} Büyük Menderes valley. The main products of the area are typical of the Aegean region: olives, figs, citrus fruits, grapes, strawberries etc. and the local industry is the processing of these products: olive oil pressing, spinning <b>cotton,</b> preparing and <b>packing</b> fruit, especially figs. Sultanhisar itself {{is a small town}} of 6,000 people on the İzmir-Afyon railway line. The local cuisine features typical Aegean dishes such as the bread-pancakes called gözleme. The town has a horticultural school of Adnan Menderes University.|$|R

So, the basement was designed for the Waste Place, Conditioning Cellar, Warehouse & <b>Packing,</b> <b>Cotton</b> Room, Mixing Room, and Dust Cellar; it was 8 ft in height. The ground floor (known as the 1st Storey) was 16 ft , the attached Card Shed and Blowing Room was 12 ft in height. The 1st Spinning Room on the 2nd Storey was 14 ft high. 2nd and 3rd spinning Room on the 3rd and 4th storey were 13 ft high, while the 4th Spinning Room on the 5th storey was 14 ft high. The tower contained the staircase, hoist and toilets.|$|R
40|$|The {{effective}} {{weight of a}} cup in a cup spinning frame {{is the difference between}} the actual weight of the cup and the resistance of fibers withdrawn from the cup. The relationship between this resistance of withdrawn fibers and their number has been studied in various weights of a sheet of fibers made of <b>cotton</b> and wool <b>packed</b> in the cup. As the result of this experiment the straight line relationship has been approximately established beween them. 　The count of yarn spun from the cup spinning frame, therefore, can be regulated by the variation of the {{effective weight}} of the cup that depends on the position of the weight on the lever...|$|R
50|$|Treatment for horses with thrush {{includes}} twice-daily picking of the feet, taking {{special care}} {{to clean out}} the two collateral grooves and the central sulcus. The feet may then be scrubbed clean using a detergent and/or disinfectant and warm water, before the frog is coated with a commercial thrush-treatment product, or with iodine solution, which may be soaked into <b>cotton</b> balls and <b>packed</b> into the clefts. Several home remedies are used, such as a hoof packing of a combination of sugar and betadine, powdered aspirin, borax, or diluted bleach. It is best, however, to speak with the horse's veterinarian, to be sure these home remedies are effective and, more importantly, safe for use on horses.|$|R
40|$|Fluctuating {{asymmetry}} in bilaterally placed sensory {{structures of}} insects {{may be considered}} maladaptive; natural selection should favour a symmetrical system. Among bushcrickets or katydids, threshold hearing sensitivity is, in part, dependent {{on the size of}} the auditory spiracle in the prothorax. We tested the degree of natural asymmetry in the hearing system of the ensiferan orthopteran Requena verticalis by measuring the size of the auditory spiracle of females. Naturally occurring asymmetry approached 8 %, which translates to a hearing bias at a threshold of only 0. 8 dB. Auditory asymmetry of females was experimentally exaggerated by <b>packing</b> <b>cotton</b> wool into either the right or left auditory spiracle. We made neurophysiological recordings from the ascending auditory T-fibre in the neck connective and found that the left–right bias created by this operation approximated 5 dB; this is greater than that found in nature.

40|$|It is very {{important}} to qualify and quantify volatile arsenic species produced by sediment in order to further understand transformation and transportation of arsenic. Effective separation and sensitive detection of various volatile arsenic species are definitely the key steps for that. In this paper, a short <b>packed</b> <b>cotton</b> column was found effective to separate volatile arsenicals (AsH(3), CH(3) AsH(2), (CH(3)) (2) AsH and (CH(3)) (3) As) rapidly. Based on this, a new online system for collection and speciation of volatile arsenic species was developed. After successful separation on a cotton column, volatile arsenic species were sensitively detected by atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS). A special PTFE chamber was designed and applied for both incubation and collection of volatile arsenicals generated from sediment online. Minor amounts of volatile arsenicals produced from sediment in headspace were sensitively measured. Real sample analysis and a spiking experiment indicated that the established system was sensitive and practical for the analysis of volatile arsenicals produced in the environment. It will be a very useful tool for further understanding the transformation of arsenic in the environment with low instrumental costs and running fees...|$|R
5000|$|New Orleans screwmen were {{responsible}} for tightly compressing and <b>packing</b> <b>cotton</b> bales into the holds of ships. This critical task put them {{at the top of}} the labor force on the docks and allowed them to insist on the highest wages; their work was highly skilled, required immense strength, and was indispensable to the smooth operation of the waterfront. However, in contrast to other waterfront laborers, white screwmen had resisted cooperation with their black counterparts. In the 1880s, the white screwmen refused the 50-50 arrangements and voted for a quota system that allowed only 20 black screwmen crews per day. [...] Another account put the limit at 100 black screwmen at any one time. [...] The locals had separate contracts with different terms, and there was no way to support workers in labor disputes. In addition, rumors began to spread that shipping agents were trying to find ways to remove the 75-bale per day limit instituted by white screwmen by using black screwmen who would work for lower wages with no limit on bales stowed. [...] A black shipping company also emerged. [...] Such types of racial divisions led to riots in the mid-1890s as black screwmen attacked their white counterparts, whites responded with equal violence, and numerous deaths resulted.|$|R
