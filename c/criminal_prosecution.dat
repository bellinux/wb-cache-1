5|$|The Department of Justice is {{responsible}} for handling legal matters for the government. Its responsibilities include providing legal advice, <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution,</b> civil representation, legal and policy drafting and reform and international legal co-operation between different jurisdictions. Apart from prosecuting criminal cases, lawyers of the Department of Justice act {{on behalf of the}} government in all civil and administrative lawsuits against the government. As protector of public interest, the department may apply for judicial reviews and may intervene in any cases involving the greater public interest. The Basic Law protects the Department of Justice from any interference by the government when exercising its control over <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution.</b>|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} much debate and {{discussion}} about the potential public health impact {{of the emergence of}} <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> for the sexual transmission of HIV in the United Kingdom. This paper offers a unique opportunity to examine data that connects views on <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> with evidence of HIV prevention need among an opportunistic sample of men in the UK who are homosexually active. Quantitative and qualitative data on <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> were collected {{as a part of the}} Gay Men's Sex Survey 2006, and this paper represents an initial analysis of those responses. The data demonstrate how dominant views on <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> come into direct conflict with health promotion aims, thereby exacerbating pre-existing HIV prevention need in a population at increased risk of participating in HIV transmission. This conflict is most clearly apparent in the close relationship between men's support of <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions,</b> and their expectation that a partner with diagnosed HIV will disclose his status before engaging in sex. Changing such unrealistic and universalised expectations has long been an aim of HIV prevention planning that targets Gay and Bisexual men, yet it would appear that the popularity of <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> helps to resist attitudinal change, thereby exacerbating HIV prevention need...|$|R

5|$|From the 1990s, {{the issue}} of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy and other church members has become the subject of civil litigation, <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution,</b> media {{coverage}} and public debate in countries around the world. The Catholic Church has been criticised for its handling of abuse complaints when it became known that some bishops had shielded accused priests, transferring them to other pastoral assignments where some continued to commit sexual offences.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of the test {{considers}} whether the law prescribes different treatment for one group of individuals as against other groups. For example, in the 1998 High Court decision Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor, Judge of Appeal M. Karthigesu found that the Prevention of Corruption Act differentiated between classes of people as it renders some, but not all, persons open to <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution</b> in Singapore for offences committed outside Singapore.|$|E
5|$|A seizure {{does not}} occur just because the {{government}} questions an individual in a public place.

The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds, with few exceptions. His refusal to listen or answer does not by itself furnish such grounds.|$|E

5|$|Schmerber v. California, , was a {{landmark}} United States Supreme Court {{case in which}} the Court clarified the application of the Fourth Amendment's protection against warrantless searches and the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination for searches that intrude into the human body. Until Schmerber, the Supreme Court had not yet clarified whether state police officers must procure a search warrant before taking blood samples from criminal suspects.

TAV Engineering Ltd and Motherwell Control Systems were found guilty of failing to protect their employees. Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd {{was found guilty of}} failing to prevent major accidents and limit their effects and then pleaded guilty to causing pollution to enter controlled waters underlying the vicinity around the site, contrary to the Water Resources Act.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{policies}} and practices which resulted in individuals being punished for peacefully exercising their human rights by sending them to RTL have not fundamentally changed: quite the contrary. There is ample evidence that such policies and practices are continuing in full force. The latest anti-Falun Gong campaign, launched earlier this year and intended to operate for three years, shows that the CCP’s determination to rid China of this spiritual group has not abated. Falun Gong practitioners continue to be punished through <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecution</b> and being sent to “brainwashing centres” {{and other forms of}} arbitrary detention. Petitioners likewise continue to be subjected to harassment, forcibly committed to mental institutions and sent to “black jails” and other forms of arbitrary detention. Human rights defenders, democracy advocates, whistle-blowers and other political activists are also being increasingly targeted through criminal detention, “black jails”, short-term administrative detention, and enforced disappearances, rather than RTL.|$|E

50|$|More recently, Lyal S. Sunga {{has argued}} that unless truth {{commissions}} are set up and conducted according to international human rights law, international criminal law and international humanitarian law, they risk conflicting or undermining <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions,</b> whether these prosecutions {{are supposed to be}} carried out at the national or international levels. He contends that this risk is particularly pronounced where truth commissions employ amnesties, and especially blanket amnesties to pardon perpetrators of serious crimes. On the other hand, <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> should be better tailored to focus on victims and to place events in proper perspective. Sunga therefore proposes ten principles for making truth and national reconciliation commissions fully complementary to <b>criminal</b> <b>prosecutions</b> in a way that conforms fully to international law.|$|R
