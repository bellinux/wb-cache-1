2500|$|The ratchet <b>control</b> <b>button</b> {{on the end}} of a fly-off {{handbrake}} {{is designed}} to work in the opposite way to what is normally accepted. If the lever is lifted or pulled back to the [...] "on" [...] position, on letting go it immediately releases unless the end button is pressed and held in place before letting go of the lever. Once set, the brake is released by lifting the handbrake lever (not pushing the button) in the setting direction (up or back). This mechanism was traditionally fitted to sports cars to facilitate a racing get-away, such as at traffic lights. It can also be used to help the back wheels to slide, without the worry of the ratchet leaving the brake on.|$|E
