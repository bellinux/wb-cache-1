5000|$|Zoom lenses are {{not used}} in view camera photography, {{as there is no}} need for rapid and {{continuous}} change of focal length with static subjects, and the price, size, weight, and complexity would be excessive. Some lenses are [...] "convertible": the front or rear element only, or both elements, may be used, giving three different focal lengths, though the quality of the single elements is not as good at larger apertures as the combination. These are popular with field photographers who can save weight by carrying one <b>convertible</b> <b>lens</b> rather than two or three lenses of different focal lengths. Older convertible lenses may not be corrected for chromatic aberration, making them unsatisfactory with color film.|$|E

50|$|The {{desire for}} an {{all-in-one}} lens {{is hardly a}} new phenomenon. <b>Convertible</b> <b>lenses,</b> still used by large format film photographers (insofar as large format photography is used), consisting of two cells {{that could be used}} individually or screwed together, giving three-lenses-in-one, date back to at least the Zeiss Convertible Protar (Germany) of 1894.|$|R
5000|$|The {{complexity}} of a lens — {{the number of}} elements and their degree of asphericity — depends upon the angle of view, the maximum aperture, and intended price point, among other variables. An extreme wideangle lens of large aperture must be of very complex construction to correct for optical aberrations, which are worse {{at the edge of}} the field and when the edge of a large lens is used for image-forming. A long-focus lens of small aperture can be of very simple construction to attain comparable image quality: a doublet (two elements) will often suffice. Some older cameras were fitted with <b>convertible</b> <b>lenses</b> (German: [...] ) of normal focal length. The front element could be unscrewed, leaving a lens of twice the focal length, and half the angle of view and half the aperture. The simpler half-lens was of adequate quality for the narrow angle of view and small relative aperture. Obviously the bellows had to extend to twice the normal length.|$|R
5000|$|The Kodak Type 025 Retina Reflex is an SLR {{camera with}} so called <b>convertible</b> <b>lenses</b> (German: Wechselobjektiv), {{interchangeable}} lens components made by Kodak AG Stuttgart, Germany. It was made between Spring 1957 and October 1958. Like many SLR cameras of German heritage {{it works with}} a leaf shutter instead of a focal plane shutter. It was named Type 025 Retina Reflex since it inherited several features from the viewfinder camera Type 021 Retina IIIc: The film advance and exposure counting system, the film channel, the selenium meter, and the focusing mechanics of the lenses. Even the Synchro-Compur shutter {{is very similar to}} that of the viewfinder camera. The Retina reflex is basically a fixed-lens camera rear except for one aspect - the front three elements are contained in a cell that bayonets into the front of the lens assembly. The standard front cell can be replaced with one of three Schneider components - an 80mm and two different 35mm components. The rear part of the lens (which is a permanent part of the camera body) contains the focusing apparatus, the entire Synchro-Compur shutter, the aperture, and the three rear elements, which are common to all 4 lenses. This interchangeable front component concept was introduced in 1954 with the Kodak Retina IIIc. Care must be exercised when using front components other than the standard (50mm) one, as it is possible to set the body mounted aperture wider than the maximum aperture of the lens (i.e. f/2 instead of f/4 or f/5.6).|$|R
