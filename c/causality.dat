5|$|Philosophy {{of physics}} {{is the study}} of the fundamental, {{philosophical}} questions underlying modern physics, the study of matter and energy and how they interact. The main questions concern the nature of space and time, atoms and atomism. Also included are the predictions of cosmology, the interpretation of quantum mechanics, the foundations of statistical mechanics, <b>causality,</b> determinism, and the nature of physical laws. Classically, several of these questions were studied as part of metaphysics (for example, those about <b>causality,</b> determinism, and space and time).|$|E

Anseel and Duyck concluded that people tend to choose to work for companies that match their initial.But Simonsohn suspected that, likeWalt Disney working for Disney, many people work for companies named after themselves or a family member. When he controlled for reverse <b>causality</b> in a large US data set, he could not see any evidence for people choosing to work for companies matching their initial.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{uncertain reasoning}} based on causal knowledge given by two layered networks, where nodes in one layer express possible causes {{and those in}} the other are possible effects. Uncertainties of the <b>causalities</b> are given by conditional causal possibilities, which were proposed to express the exact degrees of possibility of <b>causalities.</b> They also have an advantage over the conventional conditional possibilities in the number of possibilistic values that should be given as a priori knowledge. The number of conditional causal possibilities given as knowledge is far smaller than that of conventional conditional possibilities. However, their weakness is that they cannot deal with <b>causalities</b> with compound effects by plural causes, such as synergistic and canceling effects on uncertainty of <b>causalities.</b> The paper discusses this weakness and proposes a solution...|$|R
5|$|The novelists of the {{dictator}} novel genre combined narrative strategies of both modern and postmodern writing. Postmodern techniques, constructed {{largely in the}} late 1960s and 1970s, included use of interior monologues, radically stream-of-consciousness narrative, fragmentation, varying narrative points of view, neologisms, innovative narrative strategies, and frequent lack of <b>causality.</b> Alejo Carpentier, a Boom writer and contributor to {{the dictator}} novel genre pioneered {{what came to be}} known as magical realism, although the use of this technique is not necessarily a prerequisite of the dictator novel, as there are many that do not utilize magical realism.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the areas}} of focus on object {{permanence}} has been how physical disabilities (blindness, cerebral palsy and deafness) and intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, etc.) affect the development of object permanence. In a study that was performed in 1975-76, {{the results showed that}} the only area where children with intellectual disabilities performed more weakly than children without disabilities was along the lines of social interaction. Other tasks, such as imitation and <b>causality</b> tasks, were performed more weakly by the children without disabilities. However, object permanence was still acquired similarly because it was not related to social interaction.|$|E
5|$|Other {{scholars}} {{have identified the}} text's tone as satirical and mildly obscene, locating it among a movement of pamphlets influenced by a counter-trend promoting greater sympathy for prostitution. Linda Dowling interprets the pamphlet less a broadside against sodomites, and more as evidence of a strand in rhetoric that valorized Britain's martial past and saw {{lack of respect for}} it as a precondition for vice. Ian Bell considers the <b>causality</b> of this relationship between moral collapse and vice, characterizing the book as part of strand that saw vice as a product, not a cause, of a fundamental collapse in morality in Augustan London.|$|E

As {{a part of this}} target, vast subjective video quality survey has been conducted to define these <b>causalities.</b> These <b>causalities</b> were particularly important in designing of our video quality prediction model based on Bayesian network.

Keywords. Concurrency, formal semantics, equivalence notions, trace theory. 1 Introduction An important branch of research in concurrency theory was initiated by Mazurkiewicz [10]: Trace theory gives semantics for concurrent systems by presupposing a notion of dependency of actions describing which actions in a system may occur concurrently and which may not. This gives a "noninterleaving semantics" where <b>causalities</b> between action occurrences are represented. However, {{this is a special}} approach since it requires that it is indee [...] ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMost of the {{environmental}} assessments do {{not take into account}} properly the variety of {{the environmental}} impacts, or are using tools, which do not represent the impacts. A correct representation of the whole range of impacts is necessary to ensure that sustainability takes into account environmental issues to a satisfactory degree. What are the impacts on environment? What are their characteristics or typical features? We answer to these questions by using the concept of chain of <b>causalities,</b> between a source and a final impact. The parameters of the chain of <b>causalities</b> are: the type of source (infrastructure building, vehicle production, energy production and distribution, traffic, vehicle and infrastructure destruction), the process itself through the main scientific disciplines involved, the time and distance scales between the source and the final impact, the type of final target (nature: resources and ecosystems; humans: human health in a restricted meaning and human well-being; man-made heritage; earth covering all the targets). This analysis allows us to define 44 chains of <b>causalities,</b> corresponding to various public concerns. They are independent and cover all the impacts...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe article {{examines}} <b>causalities</b> between sovereign, most important quasi-sovereign CDS prices (Gazprom, VTB, Sberbank) for Russia {{and the global}} volatility factor embedded in the VIX index dynamics. The analysis refers to the post-bailout period in this major emerging economy (May 2009 –July 2013). The <b>causalities</b> are assessed in the time (the Hong test) and frequency (the Breitung–Candelon test) domains. The VIX index dynamics has a strong impact on all Russian CDS, but also receives a non-negligible feedback from them. The sovereign and quasi-sovereign CDS prices exhibit a strong causal connectedness in both domains, {{with the impact of}} the quasi-sovereigns (in particular, that of banks) getting more pronounced in the longer run, i. e. over longer time horizons and at lower frequencies. High foreign exposure of the quasi-sovereigns, explicit/implicit public guarantees and the holdings of the Russian sovereign debt on their balances underlie the <b>causalities.</b> Given the systemic role that the government-controlled entities play in the Russian economy, this may lead to the “too big to save” effect with negative implications for financial and fiscal stability...|$|R
