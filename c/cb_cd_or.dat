Furthermore two inclusion complexes of <b>CB</b> with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (<b>C</b> 1 and C 2) {{were prepared to}} improve the solubility of the drug. Methods: C 1 and C 2 were obtained by freeze-drying and characterized in the solid state and in solution. Microparticles loaded with <b>CB</b> <b>or</b> <b>C</b> 1 <b>or</b> <b>C</b> 2 were prepared by spray drying and fully characterized. Results: The yield and encapsulation efficiencies of microparticles depended by both the viscosity {{and the presence of}} the inclusion complex in the feed medium nebulised. Generally, the microparticles exhibited a spherical shape with mean diameter of approximately 2 μm which was compatible with local intravesical administration using a catheter. The CB release studies from the microparticles allowed us to identify both immediate release systems (microparticles including the complexes) and prolonged release systems (microparticles including CB alone). The latter exhibited good adhesion to the bladder mucosa, as highlighted by a mucoadhesion study. Histological studies revealed a desquamation of the superficial cells when the bladder mucosa was treated with microparticles loaded with CB, while the morphology of the urothelium did not change when it was treated with microparticles loaded with the inclusion complex. Conclusion: A new CB intravesical formulation than can easily be administered with a catheter and is able to release the drug at the target site for several hours was realized. This new delivery system could be a good alternative to classic oral CB administration...|$|R

Results The predicted amino acid sequence of the cathepsin B of C. sinensis shared 63 %, 52 %, 50 % identity with that of Schistosoma japonicum, Homo sapiens and Fasciola hepatica, respectively. Sequence encoding proenzyme of <b>Cs</b> <b>CB</b> was overexpressed in Escherichia coli.

To determine the efficacy of S(, 1) recurrent selection for resistance to the two generations of ECB normally found in Iowa, the base population and four succeeding cycles of selection of BS 9 were evaluated for ECB resistance and correlated effects on agronomic traits;Significant increases were found from BS 9 C 0 to BS 9 (<b>CB)</b> <b>C</b> 4 for resistance to first generation (leaf-feeding), second generation (sheath-collar feeding), and stalk tunneling (cavity counts). Averaged over means of S(, 1) lines, populations per se, and population testcrosses, ECB damage ratings based on a 1 to 9 scale decreased from 3. 9 to 3. 0 for first generation and from 6. 0 to 4. 3 for second generation in BS 9 C 0 and BS 9 (<b>CB)</b> <b>C</b> 4, respectively. Similarly, the average of populations per se and population testcrosses for cavity counts (one cavity is ca. 2. 5 cm) decreased from 8. 2 to 4. 0 in the two populations, respectively;The increase in resistance in populations of BS 9 reduced yield losses under artificial infestations of ECB, but the reduction was not sufficient to compensate for the loss in yielding ability that occurred as a correlated effect from selection for ECB resistance. Reduction in the grain yield from BS 9 C 0 to BS 9 (<b>CB)</b> <b>C</b> 4 under no artificial infestation was estimated to be 8. 4 % caused by changes in gene frequency due to selection and 18. 8 % caused by inbreeding depression due to drift. Most of the yield reduction, therefore, was caused by a random fixation of heterozygous loci, which may have been increased because of linkages to alleles of other traits under direct and indirect selection. Ear diameter, ear height, and plant height decreased in BS 9 possibly as a result of indirect selection for shorter internode length to improve stalk hardness and, thereby, stalk-tunneling resistance;S(, 1) recurrent selection, therefore, was effective in increasing resistance throughout the life of the corn plant, but unfavorable responses in other agronomic traits, particularly in grain yield, suggest that the selection criteria for ECB resistance should include yield...|$|R

Macrophages mediate mouse resistance to various pathogens through {{the expression of}} the Nramp 1 gene. The role of this gene in the control of Brucella infection was investigated. When BALB/c mice (Nramp 1 (s)) and <b>C.</b> <b>CB</b> congenic mice (Nramp 1 (r)) were infected with Brucella melitensis, the number of Brucella organisms per spleen was significantly larger in the <b>C.</b> <b>CB</b> mice than in the BALB/c mice during the first week postinfection (p. i.). This Nramp 1 -linked susceptibility to Brucella was temporary, since similar numbers of Brucella were recovered from the two strains of mice 2 weeks p. i. The effect of Nramp 1 expression occurred within splenocytes intracellularly infected by BRUCELLA: However, {{there was no difference between}} in vitro replication rates of Brucella in macrophages isolated from the two strains of mice infected in vivo or in Nramp 1 RAW 264 transfectants. In mice, infection with Brucella induced an inflammatory response, resulting in splenomegaly and recruitment of phagocytes in the spleen, which was amplified in <b>C.</b> <b>CB</b> mice. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), performed 5 days p. i., showed that inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin- 12 p 40 (IL- 12 p 40), gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), and IL- 10 mRNAs were similarly induced in spleens of the two strains.
