50|$|Cutting speed (also called {{surface speed}} or simply speed) is the speed {{difference}} (relative velocity) between {{the cutting tool}} and {{the surface of the}} workpiece it is operating on. It is expressed in units of distance along the workpiece surface per unit of time, typically surface feet per minute (sfm) or meters per minute (m/min). Feed rate (also often styled as a solid compound, feedrate, or called simply feed) is the relative velocity at which the cutter is advanced along the workpiece; its vector is perpendicular to the vector of cutting speed. Feed rate units depend on the motion of the tool and workpiece; when the workpiece rotates (e.g., in turning and boring), the units are almost always distance per spindle revolution (inches per revolution or ipr or millimeters per revolution mm/rev). When the workpiece does not rotate (e.g., in milling), the units are typically distance per time (inches per minute or ipm or millimeters per minute mm/min), although distance per revolution or per <b>cutter</b> <b>tooth</b> are also sometimes used.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Plunge shaving is {{the most}} {{advanced}} gear finishing technique which only needs radial infeed. Its advantages include increased productivity, accuracy, long tool life, and a simple machine structure. For the plunge shaving method, the gear tooth modification only depends on the surface geometry of the plunge shaving cutter. The analytical description of the gear with tooth modifications is firstly constructed by B-spline surface fitting. Then, the grinding wheel profile is parameterized and optimized for minimizing the surface deviations of theoretical and ground (from re-sharpening machine) tooth surfaces of the plunge shaving cutter, in which the topographic error has been reduced. The cutting trace of plunge shaving cutter has also been analyzed so that the shaving efficiency can be improved. Index Terms—Gear plunge shaving, Cone grinding wheel, Topographic error, Shaving cutter serration. et al. [9] proposed a method for shaving gears with double crowning by CNC shaving machine. For shaving methods other than plunge shaving, the gear tooth modification is accomplished by tooth modifications of the shaving cutter and the coordinated motions between cutter and gear. For the plunge shaving method, however, it only depends on the surface geometry of the plunge shaving cutter.

40|$|Burrs {{severely}} {{inhibit the}} performance and aesthetics in machined parts besides posing a safety risk to the user and manufacturer. Abrasive assisted brushing presents a fast and effective method for deburring these parts but is difficult to control. The dependence of deburring rate on the workpiece material, abrasive grit size, type and rotational speed of the brush is studied. It is found that deburring rate is proportional to initial burr height indicating fracture of the burr at the root. Deburring rate increases with spindle speed and is higher for diamond than SiC. The formation of burrs in micromilling of a thin nickel-titanium alloy (nitinol or NiTi) foil used in implantable biomedical device applications is analyzed {{as a function of}} micromilling process parameters such as spindle speed, feed, tool wear, backing material and adhesive used to attach the foil to the backing material. All factors except spindle speed are found to affect burr size. If initial penetration is sufficient to cause the foil to fail in tension, the foil tears with the crack starting closer to the upmilling side and thereby resulting in larger downmilling burrs. If penetration is insufficient, the foil plastically deforms until it tears typically {{in the middle of the}} <b>cutter</b> <b>tooth</b> path. A kinematic model that captures this behavior is used to predict burr widths and is verified through experiments. The thesis also presents an investigation of the abrasive impregnated brush deburring process for thin NiTi foils. Models based on Hertzian indentation and fracture mechanics are proposed to predict the rates of indentation and deburring during brushing and are validated using experiments. The predictions of the models are within the experimental variation. Burrs can be removed with this process within 12 minutes for a 6 mm long groove with no more than a micron change in foil thickness. Knowledge of burr formation and deburring is applied to a novel micromilled thin shape memory based NiTi foil device used for the surgical correction of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness in the western world in those over age 50. Burrs on the surface of the structure are used successfully to mechanically constrain and translocate an autograft to replace the diseased RPE-Bruch's membrane under the macula. The shape memory device is analyzed using experiments and simulations.

40|$|ABSTRACT: During the {{excavation}} of tunnels in saturated soft soils, a pressurized bentonite slurry {{is often used}} to support the tunnel face.
