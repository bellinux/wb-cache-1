The undivided Bardhaman district topped the state with maximum irrigated land. The district utilises both surface water and groundwater for irrigation.

25|$|Alwar has an {{important}} place in Agriculture production in Rajasthan. Total geographical area of the district is 7,83,281 hectares which is about 2.5 per cent of the State. In 2010–2011 the net cultivated area is 5,07,171 hecters from which about 83 per cent area viz. – 4,51,546 is irrigated and remaining 17 per cent area viz. – 82,903 is unirrigated. Double cropped area is 252 hectares of which 32,230 hecter (12%) area is irrigated and remaining 2,19,819 hecter (88%) area is unirrigated. Thus, the total cropped area of the district is 8,12,873 hecters. In Kharif season Bajra, Maize, Jowar, Kharif pulses, Arhar, Sesamum, Cotton, Guar etc. are sown in about 3,29,088 hectare (42%) and in Rabi season Wheat, Barley, Gram, Mustard, Taramira, Rabi pulses etc. are sown in about 4,52,527 hectare (58%). The main source of irrigation are wells and Tube Wells. By 26064 Tube Wells about 192861 hectare area is being irrigated and by 57196 Wells about 265169 hectares area is irrigated. By other sources like canals, tanks about 404 hectares area is irrigated. About 35470 electric motors and 66502 Diesel pump sets are being used for Irrigation purposes. The normal rainfall for the district is 657.3mm. The average rainfall in last ten years in the district is 724mm. The rainfall distribution in the district is uneven and scattered which resulted some times flood problems and some time draught position which affect the Agriculture production as well as <b>cropping</b> <b>pattern</b> in Kharif & Rabi season. Thus, the Agriculture in the district by and large depends on rainfall distribution. The average rainfall in 2016 up to September is 217mm.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the socioeconomic factors which influence the profitability and adoption of new <b>cropping</b> <b>patterns,</b> and to recommend suitable measures to enhance the crop diversification program in Mahaweli System B, Sri Lanka. The adoption of new <b>cropping</b> <b>patterns</b> is determined by a number of interrelated and mutually reinforcing factors. Hence, a multidisciplinary approach is used in this study to apprehend the different attributes of the new <b>cropping</b> <b>patterns</b> and farmers' decision making environment. The analytical methods include Marginal Cost-Benefit Analysis, Multivariate Analysis of Variance, Factor Analysis and Logit Probability Model. The results from the different techniques are generally in close agreement and complement each other. Results of the Marginal Cost- Benefit Analysis indicates that an increase in current crop yields and output prices may be necessary to increase the profitability of new <b>cropping</b> <b>patterns</b> to a recommendable level. Analysis of the farmers' beliefs suggests that adopters of the new <b>cropping</b> <b>patterns</b> have more positive beliefs towards the profitability and adoption of new <b>cropping</b> <b>patterns</b> when compared to nonadopters. Factor Analysis shows that there is a wide variation between the adopters and non-adopters, and also across the different locations with respect to farm-level variables. The analysis demonstrated that the information provided by 17 selected farm-level variables may be explained by four factors; namely, management factor, social factor, farm resource factor and farm stability factor. The variables highly loaded with the stability factor (number of years of residence, amount of loan obtained for farming, irrigation condition and percentage of rice produced allocated for consumption) are closely associated with the adoption rate. A logit probability model indicates that availability of farm loans significantly increases the probability of the adoption of new <b>cropping</b> <b>patterns.</b> The study results show that the crop yield, output prices, availability of farm loans and farmer beliefs, are the dominant factors which influence the adoption of new <b>cropping</b> <b>patterns...</b>|$|R

The research problem and objective of the study handles the nature of <b>cropped</b> <b>pattern</b> and its restrictions to achieve the maximum profit, and minimization of water requirements for the <b>cropped</b> <b>pattern,</b> that are used in irrigation through the optimum use of the available inputs, i. e., land, water irrigation, agricultural labor, and costs of production. 	The study applied the linear and goal programming methods for solving the optimality problems, with respect to profit maximization, and minimization of water that are used in irrigation of <b>cropped</b> <b>pattern</b> to 40 <b>crops,</b> where each model includes 19 winter, 16 summer, and 5 nile crops, the total acreage of the copped pattern was 12. 326 million feddans, and represents about 83. 6 % from the total copped pattern in Egypt the reached about 14. 905 million feddans in 2005. 	To achieve the objectives of optimum <b>cropped</b> <b>pattern,</b> linear programming models were specified and estimated, to determine the appropriate <b>cropped</b> <b>pattern</b> in each scenario. 	The study estimated four scenarios, that were employed to achieve the objective function, and the solutions of the mathematical linear programming models revealed many results and important indicators. The main results indicate the expected <b>cropped</b> <b>pattern</b> net return was higher than the one in the actual <b>cropped</b> <b>pattern,</b> and the water that are used in irrigation were minimized. 	Finally some recommendations may be used to achieve the economic utility with respect to the Egyptian economy and the state, i. e., decreasing rice, sugar cane, and cotton crops, increasing cereal crops from wheat and maize, and increasing pulses and oil crops. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{shift from}} double-season rice (DSR) to single-season rice (SSR) in the Yangtze River Valley in China {{has led to}} a {{decrease}} in the area of rice sown since the early 1980 s and a decline in output since 1997. In this paper, changes in rice <b>cropping</b> <b>patterns</b> are described and a neoclassical household model is used to analyse differences in rice <b>cropping</b> <b>patterns.</b> The authors use the Probit model to analyse the impact on rice <b>cropping</b> <b>patterns</b> in the physical characteristics of plots, household economic characteristics and regional factors. They find that, in addition to the physical characteristics of plots, non-farm wage rates, land/labour ratios and ownership of labour-saving machinery all have significant impacts on rice cropping. Higher non-farm wages and higher land/labour ratios are associated with SSR; conversely, ownership of labour-saving machinery is associated with DSR. The policy implications are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Soil {{biological}} {{health is}} one of the best indicators for soil fertility thus plays a significant role in sustainability of cropping systems. This study was designed to investigate the impact of different seasonal variations and cropping systems on soil microbial biomass and enzymatic activities in sloppy arid soils. Soil samples were collected from the sloppy soils (high, medium and low height terraces) of Khairimurat areas under wheat (Triticum aestivum) –millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) –mung bean (Vigna radiate) cropping systems. The results revealed that the soil microbial biomass Carbon (Cmic), Nitrogen (Nmic), Phosphorous (Pmic), soil enzymes such as Dehydrogenase (DH) and Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) activity entirely depends on the soil water availability under both cropping systems at all height terraces. The wheat-mung bean cropping systems stored relatively more Nmic, Pmic, AP (activity) and less Cmic, DH (activity) as compared to wheat-millet cropping systems. Regarding the slope gradient under both <b>cropping</b> <b>patterns,</b> high height terraces had retained more Cmic contents, medium height terraces had shown more DH activity and low height terraces had maintained more Pmic contents. In addition to this, Nmic contents and AP activity remained almost similar in all types of terraces under both <b>cropping</b> <b>patterns.</b> Pertaining to seasonal variations under both <b>cropping</b> <b>patterns,</b> the summer season had shown more Cmic, Nmic, Pmic, DH and AP activity as compared to spring, winter and autumn season in all types of terraces.
