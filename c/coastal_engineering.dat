In some jurisdictions, the terms sea defense and coastal protection mean defense against flooding and erosion, respectively.

25|$|The Boussinesq {{approximation}} {{for water}} waves {{takes into account}} the vertical structure of the horizontal and vertical flow velocity. This results in non-linear partial differential equations, called Boussinesq-type equations, which incorporate frequency dispersion (as opposite to the shallow water equations, which are not frequency-dispersive). In <b>coastal</b> <b>engineering,</b> Boussinesq-type equations are frequently used in computer models for the simulation of water waves in shallow seas and harbours.|$|E

His current research encompasses numerical tsunami simulation, warning systems, disaster prevention and evacuation systems. In addition to studying modern and ancient tsunamis through field surveys and analysis of historical documents, the engineering simulation project is used to develop highly accurate quantitative tsunami warnings and assess characteristics of waterfront structures.|$|R
25|$|Sediment {{transport}} {{is applied}} to solve many environmental, geotechnical, and geological problems. Measuring or quantifying sediment transport or erosion is therefore important for <b>coastal</b> <b>engineering.</b> Several sediment erosion devices have been designed in order to quantitfy sediment erosion (e.g., Particle Erosion Simulator (PES)). One such device, {{also referred to as}} the BEAST (Benthic Environmental Assessment Sediment Tool) has been calibrated in order to quantify rates of sediment erosion.|$|E
25|$|Airy wave {{theory is}} often used in ocean {{engineering}} and <b>coastal</b> <b>engineering.</b> Especially for random waves, sometimes called wave turbulence, {{the evolution of the}} wave statistics – including the wave spectrum – is predicted well over not too long distances (in terms of wavelengths) and in not too shallow water. Diffraction is one of the wave effects which can be described with Airy wave theory. Further, by using the WKBJ approximation, wave shoaling and refraction can be predicted.|$|E

2500|$|Soil {{mechanics}} is {{a branch}} of soil physics and applied mechanics that describes the behavior of soils. It differs from fluid mechanics and solid mechanics {{in the sense that}} soils consist of a heterogeneous mixture of fluids (usually air and water) and particles (usually clay, silt, sand, and gravel) but soil may also contain organic solids and other matter. Along with rock mechanics, soil mechanics provides the theoretical basis for analysis in geotechnical engineering, a subdiscipline of civil engineering, and engineering geology, a subdiscipline of geology. Soil mechanics is used to analyze the deformations of and flow of fluids within natural and man-made structures that are supported on or made of soil, or structures that are buried in soils. Example applications are building and bridge foundations, retaining walls, dams, and buried pipeline systems. Principles of soil mechanics are also used in related disciplines such as engineering geology, geophysical engineering, <b>coastal</b> <b>engineering,</b> agricultural engineering, hydrology and soil physics.|$|E
