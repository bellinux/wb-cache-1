25|$|Auxin stimulates cell {{elongation}} by stimulating wall-loosening factors, such as elastins, {{to loosen}} cell walls. The effect is stronger if gibberellins are also present. Auxin also stimulates cell division if cytokinins are present. When auxin and <b>cytokinin</b> {{are applied to}} callus, rooting can be generated if the auxin concentration is higher than <b>cytokinin</b> concentration. Xylem tissues can be generated when the auxin concentration {{is equal to the}} cytokinins.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, the {{addition}} of fungal exudates alone partially mimicked {{the effect of the}} mantle in terms of root proliferation, root hair development and dichotomous branching. Some of these exudates act synergistically upon hyphal morphology, as with rutin (a flavonol) and zeatin (a <b>cytokinin).</b> However, some other metabolites act antagonistically, demonstrated by root development stemming from the release of hypaphorine and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). IAA must be tightly regulated in ectomycorrhizal symbioses due to its ability to inhibit root development above certain concentrations.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of cytokinins: adenine-type <b>cytokinins</b> {{represented}} by kinetin, zeatin, and 6-benzylaminopurine, and phenylurea-type <b>cytokinins</b> like diphenylurea and thidiazuron (TDZ). [...] Most adenine-type <b>cytokinins</b> are synthesized in roots. [...] Cambium and other actively dividing tissues also synthesize <b>cytokinins.</b> No phenylurea <b>cytokinins</b> have been found in plants. <b>Cytokinins</b> participate in local and long-distance signalling, with the same transport mechanism as purines and nucleosides. Typically, <b>cytokinins</b> are transported in the xylem.|$|R

50|$|<b>Cytokinins</b> have {{recently}} been found {{to play a role}} in plant pathogenesis. For example, <b>cytokinins</b> have been described to induce resistance against Pseudomonas syringae in Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum. Also in context of biological control of plant diseases <b>cytokinins</b> seem to have potential functions. Production of <b>cytokinins</b> by Pseudomonas fluorescens G20-18 has been identified as a key determinant to efficiently control the infection of A. thaliana with P. syringae.|$|R
25|$|One {{feature of}} a plant is its phyllotaxy. The {{arrangement}} of leaves on the plant body is such that the plant can maximally harvest light under the given constraints, and hence, one might expect the trait to be genetically robust. However, {{it may not be}} so. In maize, a mutation in only one gene called abphyl (abnormal phyllotaxy) was enough to change the phyllotaxy of the leaves. It implies that sometimes, mutational tweaking of a single locus on the genome is enough to generate diversity. The abphyl gene was later on shown to encode a <b>cytokinin</b> response regulator protein.|$|E
25|$|The first root {{that comes}} from a plant is called the radicle. A root's four major {{functions}} are 1) absorption of water and inorganic nutrients, 2) anchoring of the plant body to the ground, and supporting it, 3) storage of food and nutrients, 4) vegetative reproduction and competition with other plants. In response to the concentration of nutrients, roots also synthesise <b>cytokinin,</b> which acts as a signal as to how fast the shoots can grow. Roots often function in storage of food and nutrients. The roots of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with certain fungi to form mycorrhizae, and a large range of other organisms including bacteria also closely associate with roots.|$|E
25|$|The (dynamic and {{environment}} responsive) pattern of auxin distribution within {{the plant is}} a key factor for plant growth, its reaction to its environment, and specifically for development of plant organs (such as leaves or flowers). It is achieved through very complex and well coordinated active transport of auxin molecules from cell to cell throughout the plant body — by the so-called polar auxin transport. Thus, a plant can (as a whole) react to external conditions and adjust to them, without requiring a nervous system. Auxins typically act in concert with, or in opposition to, other plant hormones. For example, the ratio of auxin to <b>cytokinin</b> in certain plant tissues determines initiation of root versus shoot buds.|$|E
40|$|In {{synchronously}} cultured tobacco cells {Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi), the incorpo-ration of U- 14 C-adenosine into butanol-soluble <b>cytokinins</b> in vivo was studied. The radioactivity {{was incorporated}} into zeatin, ribosylzeatin, isopentenyladenosine and glucosylzeatin after 20 min. The radioactive <b>cytokinins</b> were identified by thin-layer chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography. From the short time course of the incorporation of 14 C-adenosine into butanol-soluble <b>cytokinins,</b> {{the presence of the}} following biosynthetic pathway in vivo was suggested: adenosine is convered into isopentenyladenosine and then into zeatin via ribosylzeatin. The biosynthetic pathway of free <b>cytokinins</b> in vivo is compared with that in vitro. Key words: Biosynthesis — Cell culture — <b>Cytokinins</b> — Nicotiana tabacum. <b>Cytokinins</b> occur naturally as bases adjacent to the first letter of the anticodon triplet in specific t-RNA species and also as free bases, ribonucleosides and ribo-nucleotides.

40|$|Abstract – We {{studied the}} effects of various <b>cytokinins</b> and urea {{derivatives}} on germination of aged seeds of in Lotus corniculatus L. The following substances were applied: N 6 -isoprenoid <b>cytokinins</b> (isopentenyl adenine and zeatin), adenine sulfate, N 6 -aromatic <b>cytokinins</b> (kinetin, benzyladenine) and their N 9 -ribosides, N-benzyl- 9 -(2 tetrahydropyranyl) adenine, and urea derivatives (diphenylurea, thidiazuron, and chloro-pyridyl phenylurea). With the exception of adenine sulfate, all <b>cytokinins</b> increased the percentage of seed germination up to twofold, depending on their kind and concentration. It is concluded that <b>cytokinins</b> may be among the missing factors in aged seeds of L. corniculatus contributing {{to the implementation of}} their full germination potential.

25|$|<b>Cytokinins</b> or CKs are a {{group of}} {{chemicals}} that influence cell division and shoot formation. They were called kinins {{in the past when}} the first <b>cytokinins</b> were isolated from yeast cells. They also help delay senescence of tissues, are responsible for mediating auxin transport throughout the plant, and affect internodal length and leaf growth. <b>Cytokinins</b> and auxins often work together, and the ratios of these two groups of plant hormones affect most major growth periods during a plant's lifetime. <b>Cytokinins</b> counter the apical dominance induced by auxins; they in conjunction with ethylene promote abscission of leaves, flower parts, and fruits.|$|R
500|$|Cytokinins are a {{class of}} plant hormones named for their control of cell {{division}} or cytokinesis. The natural <b>cytokinin</b> zeatin was discovered in corn, Zea mays, and is a derivative of the purine adenine. Zeatin is produced in roots and transported to shoots in the xylem where it promotes cell division, bud development, and the greening of chloroplasts. The gibberelins, such as Gibberelic acid are diterpenes synthesised from acetyl CoA via the mevalonate pathway. They {{are involved in the}} promotion of germination and dormancy-breaking in seeds, in regulation of plant height by controlling stem elongation and the control of flowering. Abscisic acid (ABA) occurs in all land plants except liverworts, and is synthesised from carotenoids in the chloroplasts and other plastids. It inhibits cell division, promotes seed maturation, and dormancy, and promotes stomatal closure. It was so named because it was originally thought to control abscission. Ethylene is a gaseous hormone that is produced in all higher plant tissues from methionine. It is now known to be the hormone that stimulates or regulates fruit ripening and abscission, and it, or the synthetic growth regulator ethephon which is rapidly metabolised to produce ethylene, are used on industrial scale to promote ripening of cotton, pineapples and other climacteric crops.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the genetic}} level, {{developmental}} {{studies have shown}} that repression of the KNOX genes is required for initiation of the leaf primordium. This is brought about by ARP genes, which encode transcription factors. Genes of this type have been found in many plants studied till now, and the mechanism i.e. repression of KNOX genes in leaf primordia, seems to be quite conserved. Expression of KNOX genes in leaves produces complex leaves. It is speculated that the ARP function arose quite early in vascular plant evolution, because members of the primitive group lycophytes also have a functionally similar gene [...] Other players that have a conserved role in defining leaf primordia are the phytohormone auxin, gibberelin and <b>cytokinin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{ratio of}} auxin to <b>cytokinin</b> plays an {{important}} role in the effect of <b>cytokinin</b> on plant growth. <b>Cytokinin</b> alone has no effect on parenchyma cells. When cultured with auxin but no <b>cytokinin,</b> they grow large but do not divide. When <b>cytokinin</b> is added, the cells expand and differentiate. When <b>cytokinin</b> and auxin are present in equal levels, the parenchyma cells form an undifferentiated callus. More <b>cytokinin</b> induces growth of shoot buds, while more auxin induces root formation.|$|E
40|$|Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (M. tuberculosis) resides mainly inside macrophages, {{which produce}} nitric oxide (NO) to combat microbial infections. Earlier studies revealed that proteasome-associated genes {{are required for}} M. tuberculosis to resist NO via a previously uncharacterized mechanism.

In a proteasome degradation-defective mutant, Rv 1205, a homologue of the plant enzyme LONELY GUY (LOG) that {{is involved in the}} synthesis of phytohormones called <b>cytokinins,</b> accumulates and as a consequence results in the overproduction of <b>cytokinins.</b> <b>Cytokinins</b> break down into aldehydes that kill mycobacteria in the presence of NO.

50|$|All {{the effects}} of R. fascians {{infection}} {{can be attributed to}} hormone hyperdosage. In particular, most of the effects are connected to auxin and <b>cytokinin,</b> such as: formation of green islands on leaves, wrinkling of laminae, bud proliferation, delay of senescence, and inhibition of lateral roots. In fact, R. fascians can produce itself <b>cytokinin,</b> or cytokinin-like compounds: using orf4 and orf5 in the fas operon, it can stimulate infected plants to produce <b>cytokinin,</b> and it can produce indole-3-acetic acid itself, using a pathway starting from tryptophan and passing through production of 3-indol-piruvic acid and 3-indol-acetaldeid. R.fascians can also degrade <b>cytokinin</b> to influence the cytokinin/auxin ratio.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Cytokinins</b> were {{extracted}} from the explants of Cichorium intybus L. roots grown under flowering inductive (long-day and red light), or non inductive conditions (short-day). Flowering was expressed as percent after 8 weeks of their development. Overall, <b>cytokinins</b> levels exhibited biphasic trends with initial increasing concentrations followed by a decrease over time. The highest content of <b>cytokinins</b> was observed in explants exposed to either red light or long-day periods. Measured maximum levels of up to 525 ng. g dry- 1 weight were obtained under red light exposure conditions. <b>Cytokinins</b> concentrations measured in materials cultured under long-day conditions were slightly lower by quite similar to those obtained under red-light growth conditions. In contrast, much lower peak values (not exceeding 155 ng. g dry weight) were obtained- 1 under short-day experimental conditions. The in vitro development of C. intybus under both long-day periods and exposure to red light resulted in percent flowering of 55. 75 % and 64. 28 %, respectively.
