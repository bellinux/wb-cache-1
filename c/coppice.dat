40|$|The pruning {{of olive}} (Olea europaea L.) trees is an {{expensive}} practice in olive growing. In this paper {{we report on the}} 20 year performance of an olive orchard managed by <b>coppicing.</b> This alternative method was developed to minimize pruning costs and simplify orchard management. Trees were planted at 6 x 6 m distance in spring 1969 and trained to a vasebush by regular annual pruning until spring 1980, when the orchard was divided into 10 plots of about 20 trees each and all trees in one plot were cut off at ground level. In the following years <b>coppicing</b> was extended to one additional plot per year until 1989. In 1990 the plot first <b>coppiced</b> in 1980 was <b>coppiced</b> again to begin a second cycle of <b>coppicing.</b> During the 10 years of each cycle, pruning was limited to the elimination of a few suckers in the centre of the canopy on the third year after <b>coppicing.</b> Thus, the <b>coppiced</b> system required a maximum of 14 min/plant of pruning over 10 years corresponding to 6. 5 h ha(- 1) year(- 1) of unskilled labour. The onset of fruit production occurred the third or the fourth year after <b>coppicing.</b> Fruit yield of the <b>coppiced</b> orchard was 85 % of that of an adjacent orchard trained to vasebush (control). Alternate bearing was less in the <b>coppiced</b> orchard than in the control orchard. No effect of <b>coppicing</b> was found on fruit or oil quality, or occurrence of pests and diseases. The <b>coppicing</b> method is not only suitable to rejuvenate old olive trees but also to manage orchards sustainably at a minimum cost for pruning. The main disadvantage is the unsuitability for mechanical harvesting by trunk shakers because the plant canopy is formed by multiple stems...|$|R

5|$|A {{range of}} {{important}} small mammals {{are found in}} the area, including the hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) and bats. The hazel dormouse is restricted largely to <b>coppice</b> woodland and scrub, while the bats, including the nationally rare lesser (Rhinolophus hipposideros) and greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), have a number of colonies in buildings, caves, and mines in the area. A rare and endangered species, the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in AnnexII of the 1992 European Community Habitats Directive. Amphibians such as the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) have a wide distribution across the Mendips and are often found in flooded disused quarries.|$|E
5|$|Mining was {{to remain}} the {{principal}} industry of Brownhills until the last pit closed in the 1950s. During the 18th and 19th centuries the area known as <b>Coppice</b> Side was {{the hub of the}} mining industry, and the census of 1841 showed that over 80% {{of the population of the}} area which makes up modern Brownhills lived and worked there, with up to ten pits active in the area at any one time. As in other mining areas, several men lost their lives in the Brownhills pits. Seven miners, including a boy aged 11, died in an accident in 1861, and in October 1930 an explosion at the Grove Colliery killed fourteen miners, ten of them from Brownhills.|$|E
5|$|Silviculture is the {{practice}} of controlling the establishment, growth, composition, health, and quality of forests, which are areas that have a high density of trees. Cultivated trees are planted and tended by humans, usually because they provide food (fruits or nuts), ornamental beauty, or some type of wood product that benefits people. An area of land planted with fruit or nut trees is an orchard. A small wooded area, usually with no undergrowth, is called a grove and a small wood or thicket of trees and bushes is called a <b>coppice</b> or copse. A large area of land covered with trees and undergrowth is called woodland or forest. An area of woodland composed primarily of trees established by planting or artificial seeding {{is known as a}} plantation.|$|E
50|$|In Compound <b>coppicing</b> or <b>coppicing</b> with standards, some of {{the highest}} quality trees are {{retained}} for multiple rotations in order to obtain larger trees for different purposes.|$|R
40|$|An {{alternative}} method to managing olive (Olea europaea L.) orchards for oil production is described. Using the <b>coppiced</b> system, the orchard {{is divided into}} 10 plots and all trees in one plot are <b>coppiced</b> year 1, all trees in a second plot are <b>coppiced</b> year 2, etc. In this way, the olive orchard consists of 10 different-aged plots after 10 years. Then a new cycle is started by <b>coppicing</b> trees in plot 1 in year 11, those in plot 2 in year 12, and so on. Since hardly any pruning is done after <b>coppicing,</b> the main advantages of this innovative management method are to reduce labor costs {{and the need for}} skillful labor, without negative effects on fruit yield, oil yield, or alternate bearing. Pesticide application, weed control, and fertilization were performed according to standard commercial practice. As a result, this system is more convenient than other training systems used for olive trees, it is suitable for renewing old trees, and can be adopted under many cultural conditions. The <b>coppiced</b> management system is compatible with soils of low fertility and is sustainable for long-term olive oil production...|$|R
40|$|Comparisons {{of forest}} stands of {{different}} age classes along a chronosequence {{have been used}} to investigate the effects of management on forest carbon cycling. We have estimated the soil respiration in two stands of different ages along a chronosequence of Quercus cerris L. The forest age sequence is the result of <b>coppicing,</b> a typical Italian forest management practice. Although <b>coppicing</b> is a well-known silvicultural practice, very {{little is known about the}} response of the belowground forest component and, consequently, about the implications of <b>coppicing</b> for carbon sequestration in forests. We have measured soil respiration, temperature and moisture during two 24 hour-campaigns in June and July by comparing a recently <b>coppiced</b> stand with a 20 year old stand. We found slightly lower soil respiration rates in the <b>coppiced</b> stand, probably due to the lower contribution of the C assimilate transport down to the roots as well as a scarcer water availability since the soil water content was always lower in the soil upper layers of the <b>coppiced</b> stand. There were small differences in the isotopic composition of soil derived CO 2 between the two stands and a high variability within the time series. Our data indicate that soil C loss is not significantly reduced immediately after <b>coppicing</b> and given the obvious decrease in C assimilation in this phase of forest growth, a significant loss from the system is expected during the early stages of forest re-growth...|$|R
5|$|The south part of {{the woods}} {{is an area of}} former pasture {{woodland}} with old pollards, mainly oak and some small-leaved lime. To the north, the area comprises ancient woodland of old <b>coppice</b> with standards and contains a rich variety of trees. Rare trees include Bristol whitebeam (Sorbus bristoliensis) and wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis). There are multiple species of Sorbus within the woods with at least nine native and four imported species, {{making it one of the}} most important sites in Britain for this tree. Birds which live in the woods include the raven (Corvus) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). Many butterflies and moths can be seen in summer including the white-letter hairstreak (Satyrium w-album).|$|E
5|$|Between Kintbury Lock and Newbury, passing to {{the north}} of Hamstead Marshall, the canal is very close to the River Kennet, which flows into the canal via several channels. The canal passes through an area known as the Kennet Valley Alderwoods, the largest {{remaining}} fragments of damp, ash-alder woodland in the River Kennet floodplain. The SSSI includes two woods– the Wilderness and part of Ryott's Plantation– which are important because they support a very great diversity of plants associated with this woodland type, dominated by alder (Alnus glutinosa); though ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is abundant in places and there is occasional oak (Quercus robur) and wych elm (Ulmus glabra). In addition to the wide range of higher plants the woods support a diverse bryophyte flora including the uncommon epiphytes Radula complanata, Zygodon viridissimus and Orthotrichum affine. Nearby is Irish Hill Copse. This site of coppiced ancient woodland includes an extensive area of calcareous ash/wych elm <b>coppice</b> on the hill sides, merging into wet ash/maple and acid oak/ash/hazel woodland with aspen, on the higher parts of the site. The lower slopes are dominated by dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), with abundant herb paris (Paris quadrifolia), toothwort (Lathraea squamaria), Solomon's seal (Polygonatum multiflorum), twayblade and early purple orchids (Listera ovata) and Orchis mascula and, locally, wild daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus).|$|E
25|$|Another, more {{complicated}} system is called compound <b>coppice.</b> Here {{some of the}} standards would be left, some harvested.

50|$|<b>Coppicing</b> {{is used to}} {{encourage}} growth and indefinite succession young stems. This provides ideal conditions for many woodland flowers as well as birds and invertebrates.

The exceeded carrying capacity of deer means security fencing surrounding the <b>coppiced</b> trees must be installed {{to ensure that the}} new growth is not eaten. <b>Coppiced</b> stumps may be covered in brushwood to deter deer from eating new growth. The medieval practice of pollarding could be introduced.|$|R

40|$|Opening of {{the forest}} canopy may result in higher fitness of {{understory}} plants due to increased light intensity on the forest soil and increased nutrient availability. Especially, tuberous orchids may profit from increased light as photosynthetic assimilation products and nutrients are accumulated in their belowground storage organs. We investigated the effects of <b>coppicing</b> on demographic structure and fruit and seed set in 15 populations of the tuberous, perennial orchid Orchis mascula, seven of which were located in undisturbed, shaded woodland and eight in recently <b>coppiced</b> woodland. <b>Coppicing</b> resulted in a massive increase in flowering and in increased fruit set. On average, 42. 9 % of all individuals consisted of flowering plants in <b>coppiced</b> woodland, whereas in undisturbed woodland only 20. 8 % of all individuals flowered. The percentage fruit set varied between 20 %and 55 % in <b>coppiced</b> woodland and was strongly related to population size (measured {{as the number of}} flowering individuals). Mean fruit weight and fruit size were also significantly higher in populations located in <b>coppiced</b> woodland than in undisturbed woodland, whereas the proportion of viable seeds was not related to woodland type. Given that O. mascula is dependent on seed set to fill space with new individuals, these results suggest that the long-term survival of this species strongly depends on frequent opening of the canopy. status: publishe...|$|R
