The relationship between crop damage estimations made by field observations and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data was studied. By transforming the <b>cadastral</b> (<b>field)</b> map into a GRID format containing cells of one metre square (ArcView, Spatial Analyst), it was possible to determine the number of cells overlaying pixels or part of pixels only within the field area and the corresponding mean NDVI value. Various techniques, including Supervised Classification and Regression Models, were applied in order to study the correlation between NDVI values and those estimated by Hellenic Organization of Agricultural Insurance (HOAI) experts.

40|$|In 1998, the FIG-Commission 7 {{published}} vision statements for {{a future}} cadastral system, named "Cadastre 2014 ". The six statements were dealing with the integration of public-rights and restrictions, the integration of services, the digital format and data modelling, public-private-partnerships, and the economic sustainability of cadastres. The developments in the <b>cadastral</b> <b>field</b> over the last 10 years were remarkable. From a tech-nical point of view, the digital age has fully arrived; with new and highly improved data ac-quisition methods such as GPS, orthophoto imagery or laser scanning and the maturing of data provision possibilities through the Internet, nearly all data are now in digital form. From a conceptual point of view, terms such as land administration, spatial data infrastructures (SDI), E-Government or national geodata infrastructure (NGDI) thrived and had a great im-pact on the geoinformation community and the cadastre. This triggered many institutional changes, reshuffling of services, integration and incorporation of agencies and departments.

40|$|The {{sustainability}} of irrigated croplands in Central Asia {{is threatened by}} degradation of their productive function. To quantify {{the extent of the}} cropland degradation, this paper combines object-based change detection and spectral mixture analysis for vegetation cover decline mapping in irrigated agroecosystems in Uzbekistan based on multitemporal Landsat TM images from 1998 to 2009. The results of the change detection reveal that the <b>cadastral</b> <b>field</b> parcels, characterized by vegetation cover decrease, occupied 18 % (52, 938 ha) of the cropland area. Spatial distribution of fields with decreased vegetation cover was mainly associated with abandoned cropland and land with inherently low-fertility soils located on the outreaches of the irrigation system and bordering natural sandy deserts. The comparison with the land degradation map based on trend analyses of 250 m MODIS NDVI time series 2000 e 2010 yielded an overall agreement of 93 %. The proposed approach is a useful supplement to the commonly applied trend analysis for detecting land degradation in cases when plot-specific data are needed but satellite time series of high spatial resolution are not available. The derived parcel-specific, spatial information supports better informed decisions on cropland rehabilitation measures...|$|R

He assumed his appointment on 1 July 1910 at which time there were seven members of the Section. All men were professional surveyors and draftsman. CMF officers of the AIC in the Military District Headquarters supervised {{the work of the}} Section. In 1912 the Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia State Governments each agreed to loan a Lands Department Survey Officer to the Survey Section RAE for two years to supervise the work of the Section in each State. Each Survey Officer was a militia officer in the AIC. The Section was divided into two sub-sections and employed in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia producing scale 1 inch to 1 mile military maps ('1 mile' map) mainly of areas around cities and key infrastructure. By mid-1913 the Section had completed topographic <b>field</b> <b>sheets</b> by plane-tabling for eight maps around Newcastle, Melbourne and Canberra. The initial method of using parish plans to position the topographic detail was soon found to be inadequate and a geodetic subsection was established in 1914 to provide surveys by geodetic triangulation as spatial frameworks for the <b>field</b> <b>sheets</b> produced by the topographers. The triangulation work started at Werribee south-west of Melbourne and proceeded west along the coast to Warrnambool. This work included the 1860 Geodetic Survey of Victoria where appropriate - much of which was produced by Royal Engineer officers.
