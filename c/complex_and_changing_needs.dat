40|$|Context: Global Software Engineering (GSE) {{continues}} to experience substantial growth and is fundamentally different to collocated development. As a result, software managers have a pressing need for support {{in how to}} successfully manage teams in a global environment. Unfortunately, de facto process frameworks such as the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) do not explicitly cater for the <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> <b>changing</b> <b>needs</b> of global software management. Objective: To develop a Global Teaming (GT) process area to address specific problems relating to temporal, cultural, geographic and linguistic distance which will meet the <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> <b>changing</b> <b>needs</b> of global software management. Method: We carried out three in-depth case studies of GSE within industry from 1999 to 2007. To supplement these studies we conducted three literature reviews. This allowed us to identify factors which are important to GSE. Based on a gap analysis between these GSE factors and the CMMI, we developed the GT process area. Finally, the literature and our empirical data were used to identify threats to software projects if these processes are not implemented. Results: Our new GT process area brings together practices drawn from the GSE literature and our previous empirical work, including many socio-technical factors important to global software development. The GT process area {{presented in this paper}} encompasses recommended practices that can be used independently or with existing models. We found that if managers are not proactive in implementing new GT practices they are putting their projects under threat of failure. We therefore include a list of threats that if ignored could have an adverse effect on an organization’s competitive advantage, employee satisfaction, timescales, and software quality. Conclusion: The GT process area and associated threats presented in this paper provides both a guide and motivation for software managers to better understand how to manage technical talent across the globe...|$|E

More recently the Australian Government has promoted adaptive management as part of the programs for achieving regional natural resource management (NRM). It is surprising that, despite its simple logic and wide acceptance as the way forward, the effective application of adaptive management principles and practices in NRM regions proves challenging and elusive. One reason may be the disconnect between the capacity of current political and funding mechanisms and the <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> <b>changing</b> <b>needs</b> of natural and human systems in the wide variety of Australian catchments.

This paper reports how this duality is being successfully accomplished within the Growing Our Own Indigenous teacher education project run by Charles Darwin University in five remote Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory, Australia. Nakata’s (2007 b) culturally responsive principles are used {{as a framework for}} tailoring evaluation within the teacher education program. These are: the need to focus on the graduates’ capacity to work in <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> <b>changing</b> terrains,the <b>need</b> for curriculum design and evaluation to build on the current capacities and experiences of Indigenous students, and the need to provide stronger support for Indigenous students to ensure they engage more rigorously since the challenges they face need more attention in curriculum and evaluation design. Strategies are described whereby lecturers ensure that learning, assessment and evaluation strategies for Indigenous perservice teachers reflect their ways of knowing, being and doing, their remote learning context, their world experience, their primary language and their family and community values. These strategies generalise across settings yet might become compromised within the increasing emphasis on nationally consistent standards, and challenge the tendency of teaching primarily to tests rather than to culturally diverse needs found in every classroom...|$|R

40|$|Background: Patients with {{amyotrophic}} lateral sclerosis (ALS) face numerous {{decisions for}} symptom management and quality of life. Models of decision making in chronic disease and cancer care are insufficient for the <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> <b>changing</b> <b>needs</b> of patients with ALS. Objective: The aim {{was to examine the}} question: how can decision making that is both effective and patient-centred be enacted in ALS multidisciplinary care? Setting and participants: Fifty-four respondents (32 health professionals, 14 patients and eight carers) from two specialized ALS multidisciplinary clinics participated in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were transcribed, coded and analysed thematically. Results: Comparison of stakeholder perspectives revealed six key themes of ALS decision making. These were the decision-making process; patient-centred focus; timing and planning; information sources; engagement with specialized ALS services; and access to non-specialized services. A model, embedded in the specialized ALS multidisciplinary clinic, was derived to guide patient decision making. The model is cyclic, with four stages: 'Participant Engagement'; 'Option Information'; 'Option Deliberation'; and 'Decision Implementation'. Discussion: Effective and patient-centred decision making is enhanced by the structure of the specialized ALS clinic, which promotes patients' symptom management and quality of life goals. However, patient and carer engagement in ALS decision making is tested by the dynamic nature of ALS, and patient and family distress. Our model optimizes patient-centred decision making, by incorporating patients' cyclic decision-making patterns and facilitating carer inclusion in decision processes. Conclusions: The model captures the complexities of patient-centred decision making in ALS. The framework can assist patients and carers, health professionals, researchers and policymakers in this challenging disease environment. 14 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Selecting an {{appropriate}} procurement method to deliver supply chain efficiencies {{can reduce the}} costs of public sector projects {{by an average of}} 5 %. Despite the considerable practical experience of Australian governments in the public sector, little agreement exists about how to effectively select an approach to deliver social infrastructure (e. g.,schools, hospitals, museums, and prisons). Determining the optimal procurement approach for social infrastructure is a challenging task considering the array of procurement methods available and the criteria that must be assessed. Methods for procurement selection that have been developed are prescriptive and unable to deal with the <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> <b>changing</b> <b>needs</b> of public sector clients. As a result, a robust procurement selection process is developed and examined using a participatory action research. Focus groups, comprised of key stakeholders involved with delivering an educational project, examined the approach's applicability and use in determining a suitable procurement method. Participants overwhelmingly supported the outcome, albeit a small minority who had limited wider exposure to alternative methods initially perceived their bastion (i. e.,a default traditional lump sum [TLS]) to be a credible option. Indeed, those participants with limited knowledge procured almost 95 % of social infrastructure projects using a TLS and did not adopt a formal procurement method selection approach. Application of the approach presented in this paper, by the public sector agency responsible for delivering its social infrastructure projects, provides a clear indication of demonstrable impact. The procurement approach that is produced enables decision makers to constantly reevaluate outcomes in the form of recommendations that are grounded in practice, reflection, and detailed evaluation. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|E

40|$|Continuous {{evolution}} {{is a key}} trait of software-intensive systems. Many research projects investigate mechanisms to adapt software systems effectively in order to ease evolution. By observing its internal state and surrounding context continuously using feedback loops, an adaptive system is able to analyze its effectiveness by evaluating quality criteria and then self-tune to improve its operations. The goals of these feedback loops range from keeping single variables in a prescribed range to satisfying non-functional requirements by regulating decentralized, interdependent subsystems. To be able to observe and possibly orchestrate continuous evolution of software systems in a <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> <b>changing</b> environment, we <b>need</b> to push monitoring of evolving systems to unprecedented levels. It has been established that security has to be built into a system {{from the ground up}} and cannot be added as an afterthought—the same is probably true for intensive monitoring.

40|$|In {{a context}} of tight housing affordability, {{increasing}} numbers of Victorians are turning to public housing to meet their housing needs. In Victorian social housing, public housing continues to provide {{the largest number of}} long-term tenancies for people in housing need. And it is apparent that the long-term financial viability of public housing needs to be addressed through reforms to the Commonwealth funding model and by finding alternative ways to attract non-government investment in social housing. This report makes 81 recommendations.   These include: Advocating for Commonwealth funding of the difference between market rent and concessional (rebated) rents on the basis that it is a community service obligation – to bring public housing into line with other corporatised government services that provide concessions to consumers, such as electricity and water supply.

40|$|The {{importance}} of family experiences on children’s development and wellbeing {{has been widely}} documented. Yet, recent reports generated by inquiries into {{child abuse and neglect}} in the Irish context raise disturbing questions with regard to how the severe maltreatment of children can occur within the family context. It is imperative that the messages generated from these inquiries can effectively inform policy and practice in terms of protecting children from harm and providing support to families at-risk. The present paper draws together key issues for parenting and family support for families ‘at risk’ based on the Roscommon and Monageer inquiries with a view to gaining insight into key issues which need to be addressed in terms of protecting children from harm and providing support for parents experiencing adversity. A number of implications arising from these reports are outlined and discussed. Specifically, the need to amplify the focus on support for parenting in the context of poverty and substance abuse is highlighted with a particular emphasis on developing sensitive screening and assessment for parents who may be difficult to engage with due to chronic mental health issues. The {{importance of}} accessing the voice of children within the provision of family support is also underlined in these findings. A key recommendation from these reports is that the needs, wishes and feelings of each child must be considered as well as the totality of the family situation. Moreover, the need for staff in child welfare and protection services to have access to ongoing training and professional development to meet the <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> <b>changing</b> <b>needs</b> of the children and families they are working with is also highlighted. Specifically, ongoing training for frontline staff in understanding the effects of drug and alcohol dependency, and, in particular, the effects on parenting and parent-child relationships is underscored in findings from these reports...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAccording to {{the growing}} {{evolution}} in complex systems and their integrations, Internet of things, communication, massive information flows and big data, {{a new type of}} systems has been raised to software engineers known as Ultra Large Scale (ULS) Systems. Hence, it requires dramatic change in all aspects of “Software Engineering” practices and their artifacts due to its unique characteristics. Attendance of all software development members is impossible to meet in regular way and face-to-face, especially stakeholders from different national and organizational cultures. In addition, huge amount of data stored, number of integrations among software components and number of hardware elements. Those obstacles constrict design, development, testing, evolution, assessment and implementation phases of current software development methods. In this respect, ULS system that's considered as a system of systems, has gained considerable reflections on system development activities, as the scale is incomparable to the traditional systems since there are thousands of different stakeholders are involved in developing software, were each of them has different interests, <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> <b>changing</b> <b>needs</b> beside there are already new services are being integrated simultaneously to the current running ULS systems. The scale of ULS systems makes a lot of challenges for Requirements Engineers (RE). As a result, the requirements engineering experts are working on some automatic tools to support requirement engineering activities to overcome many challenges. This paper points to the limitations of the current RE practices for the challenges forced by ULS nature, and focus on the contributions of several approaches to overcome these difficulties in order to tackle unsolved areas of these solutions. As a result, the current approaches for ULS miss some RE essential practices related to find vital dependent requirements, and are not capable to measure the changes impact on ULS systems or other integrated legacy systems, in addition the requirements validation are somehow depended on the user ratings without solid approval from the stakeholders...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Recruitment and {{retention}} of patients and healthcare providers in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is important {{in order to determine}} the effectiveness of interventions. However, failure to achieve recruitment targets is common and reasons why a particular recruitment strategy works for one study and not another remain unclear. We sought to describe a strategy used in a multicentre RCT in primary care, to report researchers' and participants' experiences of its implementation and to inform future strategies to maximise recruitment {{and retention}}. Methods In total 48 general practices and 903 patients were recruited from three different areas of Ireland to a RCT of an intervention designed to optimise secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. The recruitment process involved telephoning practices, posting information, visiting practices, identifying potential participants, posting invitations and obtaining consent. Retention involved patients attending reviews and responding to questionnaires and practices facilitating data collection. Results We achieved high retention rates for practices (100 %) and for patients (85 %) over an 18 -month intervention period. Pilot work, knowledge of the setting, awareness of change in staff and organisation amongst participant sites, rapid responses to queries and acknowledgement of practitioners' contributions were identified as being important. Minor variations in protocol and research support helped to meet varied, <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> <b>changing</b> individual <b>needs</b> of practitioners and patients and encouraged retention in the trial. A collaborative relationship between researcher and practice staff which required time to develop was perceived as vital for both recruitment and retention. Conclusion Recruiting and retaining the numbers of practices and patients estimated as required to provide findings with adequate power contributes to increased confidence in the validity and generalisability of RCT results. A continuous dynamic process of monitoring progress within trials and tailoring strategies to particular circumstances, whilst not compromising trial protocols, should allow maximal recruitment and retention.

40|$|People {{surviving}} severe acquired {{brain injury}} (ABI) may potentially {{benefit from the}} Council of Australian Governments 2 ̆ 7 (COAG) 5 -year initiative for young people with disability in residential aged-care facilities. Yet critical examination of this policy initiative for ABI population is warranted for 2 reasons. First, reliance on the disability sector to resolve the complexities of long-term care for people with ABI detracts attention from systemic failures at the health/disability sector interface, and notably, debate concerning the role of, and right to rehabilitation. Second, the COAG initiative is being pursued within an extraordinarily <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> variable contemporary care environment, involving multiple services and sectors, and historically, high unmet need. This raises questions as to the adequacy and sustainability of care provided under the responsibility of state-based disability services. In this article, {{it is argued that}} long-term care for young people with severe ABI is better served by incorporating a health and rehabilitation perspective alongside a disability support approach. Although the effectiveness of rehabilitation may be contested in some instances of very severe ABI, nevertheless the role of rehabilitation in seeking {{to reduce the number of}} young people at risk of entering residential aged care needs to be addressed in policy solutions. It is also suggested that provision of long time care in the contemporary care environment involves a number of challenges due to the <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> <b>changing</b> patterns of <b>need,</b> diverse funding arrangements and mix of government and nongovernment services, and the increasing demand for care...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} question {{examined in this}} thesis is: 'What are the characteristics and complexities of the informal care provided within a family to a member diagnosed with schizophrenia, in New Zealand? This {{research question}} {{is divided into two}} parts. The first part examines the characteristics and complexities of the unpaid caring work provided to a family member diagnosed with schizophrenia and the second part explores how this care provision is influenced by the social, political, cultural, legal and economic context of New Zealand. This research is important because first, very {{little is known about the}} process and interpretation of care provided to a family member diagnosed with schizophrenia and second, New Zealand places great emphasis upon deinstitutionalisation and community care. Ten women and four of their husbands were invited to participate in this research. These women were the primary informal care-givers of a family member who had experienced the cyclical acute and chronic episodes of schizophrenia. The women's husbands filled a secondary supporting role in relation to the women. The women met to identify themes related to their informal care provision. These themes were translated into an interview guide which acted as a prompt for the researcher while the women and men were articulating their stories of care-giving. Foremost amongst the findings of this research was that the dominant understandings of care should be extended in order to reflect the informal care provided to a family member diagnosed with schizophrenia. The men supported the women's care provision which reflected their family member's unpredictable, changeable and cyclical symptoms of schizophrenia. It was characterised by the primacy of supervision and monitoring and was provided on a continual (flat-line) basis. It was also established that the women were finding it increasingly difficult to meet their informal caring responsibilities, these responsibilities being increased and extended by the Government's actions to reduce both state expenditure and state caring responsibilities. The difficulty the women were experiencing in meeting the <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> <b>changing</b> care <b>needs</b> of their family member indicated that a continuum of care needs to be provided. It is argued that a continuum of care will need to include early intervention services, a range of community-based and institutionally-based mental health services, and a review of the definition of 'mentally disordered' contained within the Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act 1992. In order to coordinate and provide such a continuum of care, state, community and family caring responsibilities need to be combined, these three caring agents working collaboratively...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of collaborative interdisciplinary working {{is a key}} element of contemporary health policy. Future healthcare workers will need to work. individually, collaboratively and in teams if they are to meet the <b>complex</b> <b>and</b> <b>changing</b> <b>needs</b> of the patients they serve. The literature related to health professional team working identifies many barriers and sources of potential conflict, but there is also evidence that effective interdisciplinary teamwork can be achieved and is associated with improved health outcomes. The specialised and co-ordinated multidisciplinary team care provided in stroke units was considered to contribute directly to the improved patient outcomes seen in these units. However, the ways in which stroke unit team members co-ordinate their work was not clearly understood. This study utilised a grounded theory approach to develop an explanation {{of the ways in which}} health professionals in two stroke rehabilitation units in the North of England achieved teamwork. Data were generated through over 200 hours of participant observation and thirty four semistructured interviews with a range of team members. The findings of the study identified a basic social process which was common to team working in both stroke units; this process was termed 'opportunistic dialogue'. This represented an interactional process through which the division of labour in respect of specific rehabilitation activities was worked out and agreed by team members on a day-to-day basis. Co-location of most team members in both units led to repeated engagement in sharing and validating patient information and in exploring different perspectives. Opportunistic dialoguing contributed to mutual learning in the stroke unit teams and explained the shift in thinking and team culture which occurred as team members moved from concern with discrete disciplinary actions to dialogue and negotiations focused on collaboration to meet the needs of stroke patients. Negotiations played a major role in opportunistic dialogue and coming to agreement on the teams' rehabilitation work. The study findings emphasised the interrelatedness and interdependence of these concepts as core interactional processes contributing to the achievement of teamwork in stroke units. The study confirmed the utility of the negotiated order perspective in understanding and explaining workplace interactions, but identified that whilst negotiations were a key feature of opportunistic dialogue, other processes also contributed to achieving and maintaining teamwork. Focussing on dialogue demonstrated that patterned talk-in-interaction processes maximised the contribution of opportunistic dialogue to coordinating the skills and knowledge of the different disciplines participating in stroke rehabilitation. The achievement of teamwork in these units occurred through access to and participation in opportunistic dialogue. ...|$|E

Al {{llegar a}} la etapa de Certificación en la cual el Cliente por primera vez tenía contacto con el producto, determinó que no cubría sus expectativas y que muchas de sus necesidades habían cambiado, {{por lo tanto}} el sistema no podía pasar a Producción y se requería implementar varios controles de cambio.

El proyecto era prioritario para la continuidad del negocio por lo tanto el producto tenía que pasar a producción a la brevedad posible, pero el proyecto era inmanejable si se seguía usando el modelo CASCADA. Al identificar los problemas que traía el modelo CASCADA para el proyecto, se analizó y se identificó los procesos del modelo del Cliente. Se informó al Cliente de las ventajas de utilizar SCRUM por ser muy útil para productos cuyas necesidades son cambiantes y se obtuvo el compromiso del Cliente para que los Usuarios participen en el desarrollo del proyecto.
