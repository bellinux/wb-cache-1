60|$|This slow {{succession}} of intelligence was of some advantage to Richard Waverley {{in the case}} before us; for, had {{the sum total of}} his enormities reached the ears of Sir Everard at once, {{there can be no doubt}} that the new commissioner would have had little reason to pique himself on the success of his politics. The Baronet, although the mildest of human beings, was not without sensitive points in his character; his brother's conduct had wounded these deeply; the Waverley estate was fettered by no entail (for it had never entered into the head of any of its former possessors that one of their progeny could be guilty of the atrocities laid by Dyer's 'Letter' to the door of Richard), and if it had, the marriage of the proprietor might have been fatal to a <b>collateral</b> <b>heir.</b> These various ideas floated through the brain of Sir Everard without, however, producing any determined conclusion.|$|E
50|$|The 1838 {{constitution}} was replaced in 1842 by reviving the 1826 Constitutional Charter of Portugal. Among other things, the 1826 charter stipulated that, {{should there be}} no eligible descendants of Maria II of Portugal, the crown would pass to a <b>collateral</b> <b>heir.</b>|$|E
50|$|Over the years, {{membership}} {{rules have}} continued as first established. They provide for approving {{the application of}} a <b>collateral</b> <b>heir</b> if the direct male line dies out. Membership has been expanded in some state societies to include descendants of those who died during the war, but it remains limited.|$|E
50|$|Level IV <b>Collateral</b> <b>heirs</b> {{from the}} third to the sixth level of inheritance.|$|R
5000|$|Thus {{property}} settled upon {{someone and}} the heirs of their body—whether male, female, or generally—will pass to children, grandchildren and so on, {{but not to}} nephews of the grantee, his or her sisters, uncles and their descendants. Nor will a limitation in a grant to someone's [...] "heirs" [...] carry the property to <b>collateral</b> <b>heirs</b> in England, since the law presumes that [...] "heirs of the body" [...] are meant though a grant to the grantee and his heirs male will.|$|R
50|$|Five states (Iowa, Kentucky, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee) impose only {{inheritance}} taxes. The Tennessee tax {{is scheduled}} to be eliminated for deaths after December 31, 2015. The exemptions under state inheritance taxes vary greatly, ranging from $500 (Kentucky and New Jersey) for bequests to unrelated individuals to unlimited exemptions (Iowa and Kentucky) for bequests to lineal heirs, such as children or parents of the decedent. No states tax bequests to surviving spouses. Top tax rates range from 4.5 percent (Pennsylvania on lineal heirs) to 18 percent (Nebraska on <b>collateral</b> <b>heirs).</b> Tennessee’s inheritance tax is calculated more like an estate tax (i.e., the tax does not vary based on the beneficiary).|$|R
50|$|Kilravock Castle {{has been}} {{continuously}} tenanted by the Roses, {{a family of}} Norman origin, who arrived in Britain with William the Conqueror. They settled at Kilravock in 1293, since which date son has succeeded father without the interposition of a <b>collateral</b> <b>heir,</b> an instance of direct descent unique in Scottish history.|$|E
50|$|Succession by {{this special}} {{remainder}} {{was first to}} occur {{on the death of}} the fourth Earl in 1702, when the line of the first Earl became extinct. The Earldom was therefore able to pass through collateral succession to Sir Robert Dalzell, 3rd Baronet, the senior heir of the first Lord and a <b>collateral</b> <b>heir</b> of the first Earl being the great-grandson of the first Earl's brother. But for this special remainder, he would have inherited only the Lordship, and the Earldom would have then become extinct.|$|E
50|$|The {{most famous}} error {{made by the}} House of Lords in {{awarding}} a title {{was not in the}} case of a barony, but for the Scottish earldom of Mar which was awarded to a distant <b>collateral</b> <b>heir</b> male of a previous earl, and not to the heir general, as customary under Scottish peerage law. This 1875 Committee finding declared that a separate Scottish earldom with remainder to heirs male had been created in 1565, and in 1885 an Act of Parliament revived the ancient title for the heir general. As a result, there are two peers holding the Mar title today; the Countess of Mar (holder of the oldest surviving Scottish peerage) and the Earl of Mar and Kellie.|$|E
5000|$|While Duarte Nuno was {{accepted}} by most monarchists, there were some constitutionalists who continued to contest his claim. Duarte Nuno was undisputed as the legal heir of his grandfather, Miguel I, but there were doubts about whether he was the legal heir of the last reigning king of Portugal, Manuel II. Articles 87 and 88 of the Constitutional Charter of 1826, in force when the monarchy was overthrown, stated that the throne passed first to the descendants of Queen Maria II (from whom Duarte Nuno was not descended), and only when they were extinct to <b>collateral</b> <b>heirs.</b> [...] Maria II had living descendants in 1932, {{but none of these}} had Portuguese nationality. Article 89 of the 1826 Charter stipulated that [...] "no foreigner may succeed to the crown of the kingdom of Portugal".|$|R
500|$|After the {{rejection}} of the Second Reform Bill by the Upper House in October 1831, agitation for reform grew across the country; demonstrations grew violent in so-called [...] "Reform Riots". In the face of popular excitement, the Grey ministry refused to accept defeat in the House of Lords, and re-introduced the Bill, which still faced difficulties in the House of Lords. Frustrated by the Lords' recalcitrance, Grey suggested that the King create a sufficient number of new peers to ensure the passage of the Reform Bill. The King objected—though he had the power to create an unlimited number of peers, he had already created 22 new peers in his Coronation Honours. William reluctantly agreed {{to the creation of the}} number of peers sufficient [...] "to secure the success of the bill". However, the King, citing the difficulties with a permanent expansion of the peerage, told Grey that the creations must be restricted as much as possible to the eldest sons and <b>collateral</b> <b>heirs</b> of existing peers, so that the created peerages would eventually be absorbed as subsidiary titles. This time, the Lords did not reject the bill outright, but began preparing to change its basic character through amendments. Grey and his fellow ministers decided to resign if the King did not agree to an immediate and large creation to force the bill through in its entirety. The King refused, and accepted their resignations. The King attempted to restore the Duke of Wellington to office, but Wellington had insufficient support to form a ministry and the King's popularity sank to an all-time low. Mud was slung at his carriage and he was publicly hissed. The King agreed to reappoint Grey's ministry, and to create new peers if the House of Lords continued to pose difficulties. Concerned by the threat of the creations, most of the bill's opponents abstained and the Reform Act 1832 was passed. The mob blamed William's actions on the influence of his wife and brother, and his popularity recovered.|$|R
50|$|The Duchy of Parma and Piacenza {{continued}} to be ruled by the Farnese until the 17th century. But the city of Castro {{was removed from the}} Farnese family holdings when the Farnese fell out with the Barberini family of Pope Urban VIII sparking the Wars of Castro. In 1649, the conflict ended when Pope Innocent X had the city razed. The small dukedom eventually fell under the Spanish control and influence; the family lost Parma and Piacenza in 1731 when the last duke, Antonio Farnese, died without direct heirs and his <b>collateral</b> <b>heir,</b> his niece Elizabeth Farnese, Queen of Spain, passed a successful claim on to her sons, Don Carlos (later King Carlos III of Spain) and Filippo House of Bourbon-Parma.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the nineteenth century Babu Madho Singh, eleventh in descent from Jionarain was the rular of the estate which consisted of 101 villages. Babu Madho Singh who is remembered as the successful leader and who managed his property well died in 1823. He was succeeded by his widow, Thakurain Dariao Kunwar, a most remarkable woman, who through toil and turmoil not only bravely held her own, but added to her estates than her husband had done in his lifetime. The direct line of succession had ended with the death of Thakurain's husband, Babu Madho singh. The Next male <b>collateral</b> <b>heir</b> was Babu Rustam Sah, whom Thakurain disliked. Babu Rustam Sah was in the service of Maharaja Man Singh, the nazim of the day and with his help succeeded in capturing Thakurain and made her write a deed in his favour. That formidable woman, whose pride was hurt, grieved for a few months and died. Rustam Sah was given the possession of the property by the nazim. Rustam Sah came to know later that the nazim had ulterior motives in helping him. A fight would have followed and Rustam would have killed nazim, but for a pandit who advised him that the time was not propitious. Later, Rustam Sah sought asylum across the British border and was made the taluqdar of Dera, which consisted of 336 villages. Rustam Sah rendered excellent service during the Mutiny. He died in 1877 and was succeeded by his nephew, Raja Rudra Pratap Singh.|$|E
