40|$|Abstract Clinical {{presentation}} of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) can be diverse. Morphology {{and quantity of}} skin lesions depends on interactions between host immunity and fungus virulence.

We report herein a clinical {{presentation of}} sarcoid-like PCM, initially diagnosed as tuberculoid leprosy.

25|$|In the {{mammalian}} host, ROS is induced as an antimicrobial defense.

25|$|In {{people with}} predisposing lung diseases—such as {{persistent}} asthma or cystic fibrosis (or rarer {{diseases such as}} <b>chronic</b> <b>granulomatous</b> <b>disease</b> or Hyper-IgE syndrome)—several factors lead to {{an increased risk of}} ABPA. These include immune factors (such as atopy or immunogenic HLA-restricted phenotypes), as well as genetic factors (such as CFTR gene mutations in both asthmatics and cystic fibrosis patients). By allowing Aspergillus spores to persist in pulmonary tissues, it permits successful germination which leads to hyphae growing in mucus plugs.|$|E

40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) {{produced}} by neutrophils are crucial for defense against infectious diseases, and the adequate measurement of ROS levels {{is an important}} way to evaluate the possibility of infections. The fluorescent probe dihydrorhodamine 123 has been applied exclusively to the measurement of ROS thus far. We developed a novel method for detecting ROS, which utilizes the chemiluminescent probes Luminol and Diogenes. The new method quantitatively detects ROS produced by as few as 10 to 104 neutrophils. Furthermore, this method can detect ROS levels in one microliter of whole blood or ROS produced by Epstein-Barr immortalized B lymphocytes.

2500|$|Many {{recipients}} of HSCTs are multiple myeloma or leukemia patients {{who would not}} benefit from prolonged treatment with, or are already resistant to, chemotherapy. Candidates for HSCTs include pediatric cases where the patient has an inborn defect such as severe combined immunodeficiency or congenital neutropenia with defective stem cells, and also children or adults with aplastic anemia {{who have lost their}} stem cells after birth. Other conditions treated with stem cell transplants include sickle-cell disease, myelodysplastic syndrome, neuroblastoma, lymphoma, Ewing's sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, <b>chronic</b> <b>granulomatous</b> <b>disease</b> and Hodgkin's disease. More recently non-myeloablative, [...] "mini transplant(microtransplantation)," [...] procedures have been developed that require smaller doses of preparative chemo and radiation. This has allowed HSCT to be conducted in the elderly and other patients who would otherwise be considered too weak to withstand a conventional treatment regimen.|$|E
2500|$|Neutrophils {{and other}} phagocytes use {{peroxide}} to kill bacteria. The enzyme NADPH oxidase generates superoxide within the phagosome, which is converted via hydrogen peroxide to other oxidising substances like hypochlorous acid which kill phagocytosed pathogens. In individuals with <b>chronic</b> <b>granulomatous</b> <b>disease</b> (CGD) {{there is a}} defect in producing peroxide via mutations in phagocyte oxidases such as myeloperoxidase. Normal cellular metabolism will still produce {{a small amount of}} peroxide and this peroxide can be used to produce hypochlorous acid to eradicate the bacterial infection. However, if individuals with CGD are infected with catalase-positive bacteria, the bacterial catalase can destroy the excess peroxide before {{it can be used to}} produce other oxidising substances. In these individuals the pathogen survives and becomes a chronic infection. This chronic infection is typically surrounded by macrophages in an attempt to isolate the infection. This wall of macrophages surrounding a pathogen is called a granuloma. Many bacteria are catalase positive, but some are better catalase-producers than others. The mnemonic [...] "cats Need PLACESS to Belch their Hairballs" [...] can be used to memorise the catalase-positive bacteria: nocardia, pseudomonas, listeria, aspergillus, candida, E. coli, staphylococcus, serratia, B. cepacia and H. pylori.|$|E
