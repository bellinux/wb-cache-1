The anodes are manufactured by mixing aggregates with <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> to form a paste with a doughy consistency.

Most of the previous works on catalyzing mesophase formation have focused on either minimizing {{the impact of the}} retained catalyst or on recovering the catalyst from the product. In our previous paper [9], we have used cobalt and nickel salts in petroleum residues (paraffinic clarified oil and aromatic heavy extract) to enhance the mesophase contents, pitch yields and other physico-chemical properties. Among these petroleum residue paraffinic clarified oil having very low bureau of mines correlation index (BMCI), i.e., 51 is produced a pitch contained mesophase contents below countable limit and pitch yield being quite low (11.88 wt %). Although, the presence of transition metal salts (Co and Ni) in paraffinic clarified oil enlarged the size of mesophase spheres, i.e., increased the mesophase contents, pitch yield and other physico–chemical properties. Here, the recovery of catalysts has done by refluxing higher-density part of pitch which was settled down bottom of the reactor with ethanol. As we know that mesophase pitches are used as a precursor material for premium-quality petroleum coke. This premium-quality petroleum coke is used for making graphite electrode for steel industries. Most of the premium-quality petroleum coke in India is imported from foreign countries for making graphite electrode and other carbon products. Keeping this in view, we are trying to explore different types of transition metal catalysts which enhance the mesophase formation in paraffinic clarified oil.

5000|$|Although {{there is}} not a direct {{relationship}} between the classification systems in Figures 1 and 2, one kind of pyrobitumen is a subset of the post-oil solid bitumen formed by thermal degradation of kerogen and oil. Of the 27 samples investigated by Curiale, the three impsonite samples had the low solubility (<3%) and low H/C ratio (<0.9) characteristic of highly mature organic matter. These samples also had lowest asphaltene, highest aromatic, and highest volatile content in the soluble fraction. Carbon deposits associated with uranium nodules also had low solubilities and H/C ratios less than 1.0 and correspond to pyrobitumens with inorganic origins. For comparison, <b>coal</b> <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> has an atomic H/C ratio of about 0.8.In the petroleum geochemistry community, pyrobitumen is the remains of thermally altered oil that was previously generated during kerogen maturation—much of that oil migrated to and accumulated in an oil reservoir. Petrographic studies of residues of hydrous pyrolysis, which {{is considered to be a}} good laboratory simulation of natural petroleum formation, show the formation of a continuous bituminous network during the early stages of kerogen transformation, some of which is converted to pyrobitumen at high thermal exposure. This definition is consistent with that given for pyrobitumen in the Society of Petroleum Engineers Glossary: “a hard, native asphalt within the rock pores. Does not ordinarily move or enter into reaction.” [...] Hunt uses this definition of thermally mature residue to calculate material balances for the fate of oil at very high maturities, both that retained in the source rock and that from reservoirs. Pyrobitumen in thermally mature oil reservoirs has been characterized by Hwang. [...] More recently, the pyrobitumen retained in the source rock is considered to play an important role in the storage and production of shale gas. [...] In oil shale retorting, pyrobitumen residue has an atomic H/C ratio of about 0.5 and is often called coke, which has its analog in the production of petroleum and coal cokes by destructive distillation.|$|E
