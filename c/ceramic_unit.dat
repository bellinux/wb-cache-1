40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy, Office of Industrial Programs, has {{sponsored}} {{the development of}} a Fluidized Bed Waste Heat Recovery System (FBWHRS) and a higher temperature variant, the Ceramic Tubular Distributor Plate (CTDP) Fluidized Bed Heat Exchanger (FBHX) system. Both systems recover energy from high-temperature flue gases and produce steam. In a one-year evaluation test on an aluminum remelt furnace, the FBWHRS generated about 26 million lb of saturated steam at 150 psig. Before entering the FBWHRS, the flue gases were diluted to 1100 ?F to protect the fluidized bed distributor plate. In a second project, this FBWHRS concept was further developed by replacing the metallic distributor plate with a Ceramic Tubular Distributor Plate (CTDP), a closely spaced row of alumina rods. The <b>ceramic</b> <b>unit</b> permitted energy from flue gases to be recovered without diluting gases. Elimination of the air diluent system reduced the FBHX fluidized bed volume by 70 % and increased heat recovery by 30 %. Both systems offer several advantages.

Also, only the distributor plate is exposed to the hot fouling and corrosive flue gases since the fluidized bed quickly cools these gases to a uniform 500 ?F...|$|E

Different Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 formula ratios for glossy and matt glazes were tested with raw materials from Cameroon and Tanzania. In the Cameroonian glazes, a local pegmatite (quartz, microcline, albite) with low coloured oxides replaced an albitic feldspar in the Tanzanian glazes. The other materials were kaolin, limestone, silica and barium carbonate or zinc oxide. The glazes were tested at Seger Cone 7 (1240 ℃) on stoneware slabs (made up of the same feldspathic glaze material: 18 %, silica sand or quartz 27 %, ball clay 40 % and kaolin 15 %) from both Tanzania and Cameroon materials. From results obtained, zinc oxide acted as a more vigorous flux than barium carbonate at cone 7, which is obvious in the glazes with pegmatite (with high quartz content). At a Seger formula of Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 1 : 10, transparent glazes were obtained.

Ceramic {{heat exchangers}} are relatively new, but are gaining acceptance as more field experience becomes available. The advantage of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>units</b> over metal units is the higher temperature capabilities of the ceramic which eliminate the need for costly over-temperature controls and dilution air systems. The problems encountered with ceramic heat exchangers to date have been variable leakage and lack of durability. These problems are associated with the high thermal stresses in the compact designs and with the seals required to connect the ceramic to the metal ductwork. Coors Porcelain Company has been engaged in the development of ceramic heat exchangers for heat engine and industrial applications for several years. Durability problems were encountered from thermal stresses in these applications with recuperators made from conventional ceramics. This resulted in development' of a new ceramic mixed oxide material specifically for heat exchangers. Changes in geometry of the ceramic matrices were also made to further reduce the stresses in order to increase product durability. A housing was designed and a ceramic gasket was selected to minimize the chances of significant leakage from the seal area of the recuperator.

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{understand}} the archaeology of the Zimbabwe Culture capital of Khami through synchronic and diachronic analyses of its material culture. The research employed a number of methodological approaches that included a review of historic documents, surveying and mapping, excavations, museum collection analysis, and artefact studies, in order to collect datasets from various sections of the site, including the walled and the nonwalled areas. The main indication {{is that there is}} a great deal of similarity in material culture distribution across the whole site. An analysis of objects by stratigraphic sequence exposes continuity and change in local and imported objects. Dry stone-wall architectural data suggests that the site was constructed over a long period, with construction motivated by a number of expansionary factors. The study confirms that Khami began as a fully developed cultural unit, with no developmental trajectory recorded at Mapungubwe or Great Zimbabwe, where earlier <b>ceramic</b> <b>units</b> influenced later ones. Consequently, this study cautiously suggests that Khami represents a continuity with the Woolandale chiefdoms that settled in the south-western parts of the country and in the adjacent areas of Botswana.

40|$|When casting ceramic {{items in}} potteries, liquid ‘slip’ is passed from a {{settling}} tank, through overhead pipelines, before being pumped manually into the moulds. It {{is not uncommon}} for bubbles to be introduced into the slip as it passes through the complex piping network, and indeed the presence of bubbles is a major source of financial loss to the ceramics industry worldwide. This is because the bubbles almost always remain undetected until after the ceramic items have been fired in a kiln, during which process bubbles expand and create unwanted holes in the pottery. Since there it is usually an interval of several hours between the injection of the slip into the moulds, and the inspection of the items after firing, such bubble generation goes undetected on the production line during the manufacture of hundreds or even thousands of <b>ceramic</b> <b>units.</b> Not only does this mean hours of wasted staff time, power consumption and production line time: the raw material which makes up these faulty items cannot even be recycled, as fired ceramic cannot be converted back into slip. Currently, the state-of-the-art method for detecting bubbles in the opaque ceramic slip is slow and invasive, can only be used off-line, and requires expertise which is rarely available. This paper describes the invention, engineering and in-factory testing across Europe of an ultrasonic system for real-time monitoring for the presence of bubbles in casting slip. It interprets changes in the scattering statistics accompanying the presence of the bubbles, the latter being detected through perturbations in the received signal when a narrow-band ultrasonic probing wave is transmitted through the slip. The device can be bolted onto the outside of the pipeline, or used in-line. It is automated, and requires no special expertise. The acoustic problems which had to be solved were severe, and included making the system capable of monitoring the slip regardless of the material of pipe (plastic, steel, etc.) and nature of the slip (which can be very variable). It must also be capable of detecting bubbles amongst the myriad solid particles and other species present in the flowing slip. The completed prototype was tested around several factories in Europe, and proved not only to be more versatile, but also more sensitive, than the state-of-the-art metho...|$|R

The RO permeate {{in this study}} almost achieved the German effluent limits for wastewater treatment plants size 5.

Similar behavior was observed by adding different amounts of hesperidin to these pectin solutions, but with much lower permeate flows. The formation of gel layers on the membrane surface is mainly responsible for the lower permeate fluxes. In addition, the permeate flux decrease faster at higher Delta P, since higher Delta P brought bigger flux at lower pectin concentration. Compared with the more than 90 % retention rate of macromolecular pectin, pigment and other component have less than 20 % retention rate.

The aim of the work was to carry out extended time testing of the developed gasification and hot gas cleaning process and to determine the fate of different gas contaminants and trace components of wood. In the test runs, wood fuels were gasified in the CFB reactor at a 0. 2 – 0. 25 MPa pressure using a mixture of steam and oxygen as the gasification agent. A mixture of sand and dolomite was used as the bed material in order to maintain stable fluidization and to catalyse in-situ tar decomposition before hot filtration. Raw gas was filtered at ca. 550 °C and the filtered gas was then led into a two-stage catalytic tar reformer. The gasifier performance and the concentrations of different gas contaminants were determined at four different operating variable set points during a total of 215 h of operation.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} performance characteristics of masonry units is their high thermal insulation. There are many different ways to improve this parameter, however the most popular methods in case of <b>ceramic</b> masonry <b>units</b> are: addition of pore-creating raw materials and application of proper hole pattern. This study was an attempt to improve thermal insulation of ceramics by applying thermal insulation additives. Perlite dust created as a subgrain from expansion of perlite rock was used. Perlite subgrain is not very popular among consumers, that’s why it’s subjected to granulation to obtain coarse grain. The authors presented concept of direct application of perlite dust for the production of building ceramics with improved thermal insulation. Fineness of this additive is asset for molding of ceramic materials from plastic masses. Based on the results it was found that about 70 % perlite by volume can be added to obtain material with a coefficient of heat conductivity of 0, 37 W/mK. Higher content of this additive in ceramic mass causes deterioration of its rheological properties. Mass loses its plasticity, it tears up and formed green bodies are susceptible to deformation. During sintering perlite takes an active part in compaction process. Higher sintering dynamics is caused by: high content of alkali oxides in perlite and glass nature of perlite. Alkali oxides generate creation of liquid phase which intensifies mass compaction processes. Active role of perlite in sintering process causes good connection of its grains with clay groundwork which is important factor for mechanical parameters of ceramic materials. It was also noted that addition of perlite above 40 % by volume of mass effectively neutralized negative effect of efflorescence in ceramic materials...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 A new {{structural}} {{health monitoring}} (SHM) system, {{which consists of}} a piezoelectric drive and a ferroelectric-based sensor unit, is proposed. Unlike the current SHM system, the proposed SHM system has only a sensor unit and a drive unit, a low-power source to operate the system, and requires no heavy weight memory unit to record data. For the ferroelectric-film-based sensor unit, a polarization fatigue measurement system is developed and a numerous sets of polarization fatigue tests on ferroelectric films with millions of repetitions are conducted. The polarization fatigue data of the ferroelectric thin films provide the reduction of their polarization under {{a certain number of}} cyclic electric fields. For the drive unit, a bulk piezoelectric ceramic is mounted on a structural component sending out voltage, which is induced by the deformation on the structural component. By electrically connecting the drive unit to the sensor unit and an interface circuit in between, we utilize the polarization fatigue data of ferroelectric-film-based sensor unit to record only a critical number of cycles of a dynamic load history of larger magnitudes. The proposed SHM system is verified by a numerous sets of random-amplitude dynamic tests, which demonstrate that the proposed SHM system performs reliable accuracy for counting cycles, whose amplitude is larger than a specific value. To protect the fragile piezoelectric <b>ceramic</b> based drive <b>unit,</b> we analyze the reduction of stress if the piezoelectric patch is mounted on a structural component with an adhesive layer in between.
