40|$|ABSTRACT: Two cases (a 40 -year-old {{man and a}} 6 -year-old child) are presented, {{in which}} deaths {{occurred}} with symptoms of fulminant liver failure. Mechanical <b>cholaemia</b> was excluded; however, steatosis (in both cases) and an inflammatory state (in the man) of the liver were ascertained. Although no hepatotoxical factor other than paracetamol was ascertained, {{it could not be}} unequivocally established as the cause of the fulminant liver failure as the interview was incomplete, and the re-sults of toxicological examinations showed that the levels of the medicine were situ-ated within the range of therapeutic concentrations, and also results of histological examinations did not show necrosis of the middle lobulated, which is characteristic for acute intoxication with large doses of paracetamol. In both cases, however, there were circumstances that considerably increased the risk of hepatotoxicity of para-cetamol. In the child, gastrointestinal disturbances and a diet connected to them could have increased the hepatotoxic activity of the medicine. The occurrence of alco-holic-paracetamol syndrome in the man, on the other hand, could have been caused by protracted abuse of alcohol and a 2 -day abstention before death...|$|E
40|$|A VARIABLE {{degree of}} blood {{destruction}} {{over and above}} that occurring physi-ologically is a constant phenomenon in attacks of malaria. Although blood destruction is always increased in a malarial attack, clinical signs of hemolysis (jaundice, anemia, etc.) are not always present. The clinical syndrome of hemolytic anemia in malaria is known in its severest form as blackwater fever, which {{is characterized by the}} acute development of a marked anemia, hemoglobinuria, intense jaundice, and marked reticulocytosis. In less severe hemolysis, there is only slight jaundice and moderate anemia, accom-panied by a slight {{rise in the number of}} reticulocytes and by an increased excretion of urobilinogen in the urine. However, in these cases the hemolytic nature of the jaundice is not generally accepted. Stitt ” remarks: “It is not improbable, although this point is often disputed, that the yellow tinge of the skin and the sclerae often observed in malaria is due to the tinting of the tissues by the liberated hemoglobin and not as popularly believed to biliousness or <b>cholaemia</b> from bile absorption. ” Hemolysis in its slightest form may at times be manifested, according to Stit...|$|E
