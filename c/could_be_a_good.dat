5|$|Governor David Paterson's {{selection}} process {{began with a}} number of prominent names and high-ranking New York Democrats, including Andrew Cuomo, Fran Drescher and Caroline Kennedy, vying for the spot. Gillibrand quietly campaigned for the position, meeting secretly with Paterson on at least one occasion. She said that she made an effort to underscore her successful House elections in a largely conservative district, adding that she <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> complement to Chuck Schumer. Gillibrand was presumed a likely choice {{in the days before the}} official announcement. On January 23, 2009, Paterson held a press conference to announce Gillibrand as his choice.|$|E
5|$|Many Western Catholics have voiced {{significant}} {{disagreement with}} the Church's teaching on contraception. Catholics for Choice, a political lobbyist group which is not associated with the Catholic Church, stated in 1998 that 96% of U.S. Catholic women had used contraceptives {{at some point in}} their lives and that 72% of Catholics believed that one <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> Catholic without obeying the Church's teaching on birth control. Use of natural family planning methods among United States Catholics purportedly is low, although the number cannot be known with certainty. As Catholic health providers are among the largest providers of services to patients with HIV/AIDS worldwide, there is significant controversy within and outside the church regarding the use of condoms as a means of limiting new infections, as condom use ordinarily constitutes prohibited contraceptive use.|$|E

Despite this, the reviewers {{stated that it}} <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> educational tool. The game's iOS remake received a better reception, with a Metacritic score of 66/100. Multiplayer claimed the game was fun at first, but soon went downhill. They gave the game a 65/100.|$|E
25|$|Ancient slag is {{difficult}} to date. It has no organic material with which to perform radiocarbon dating. There are no cultural artifacts like pottery shards in the slag with which to date it. Direct physical dating of slag through thermoluminescence dating <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> method to solve this problem. Thermoluminescence dating is possible if the slag contains crystal elements such as quartz or feldspar. However, the complex composition of slag can make this technique difficult unless the crystal elements can be isolated.|$|E

According to a nationwide poll of 2,242 U.S. adults surveyed online in September 2005 by Harris Interactive (they stated that the magnitude of errors cannot be estimated due to sampling errors, non-response,etc.), 90% of U.S. Catholics supported the use of birth control/contraceptives. A survey conducted in 2015 by the Pew Research Center among 5,122 U.S. adults (including 1,016 self-identified Catholics) stated 76% of U.S. Catholics thought that the church should allow Catholics to use birth control.|$|E

In 1926 he attempted to emulate Italian fascism. He remains the prototype of Polish right-wing nationalism and has been called [...] "the father of Polish nationalism."

500|$|Illustrator John Eaves {{created a}} drawing {{of a number of}} {{real-world}} and Star Trek vessels leaving Earth, which was subsequently turned into a poster by Dan Madsen at the Star Trek Communicator magazine. Eaves gave copies of this poster to Braga and Berman, with Berman suggesting the possibility that this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> concept for an opening sequence. The aim of the sequence was to follow the evolution of exploration, flight and space flight. As suggested by Eaves' poster, it included real-world vessels such as HMS Enterprise, Spirit of St. Louis, the Bell X-1, the Space Shuttle Enterprise amongst others in addition to the Mars rover Sojourner and the International Space Station. Star Trek vessels featured included two new designs by Eaves as well as the first warp vessel, the Phoenix, and the Enterprise (NX-01). The Phoenix spacecraft was presented in the 1996 feature film [...] as Earth's first warp vessel, whose inaugural warp flight triggered first contact with the Vulcans.|$|E
500|$|Changes {{have been}} {{proposed}} {{over the years to}} reduce possible inconsistencies between scorers and possible mistakes made by the official scorer, especially {{as the end of the}} writer-scorer era began to seem likely in the late 1970s. The BBWAA and professional baseball umpires have suggested the creation of a [...] "fifth umpire". Four-man umpire crews rotate officiating responsibilities after each game, and travel to several stadiums per year. This new fifth umpire would travel with the umpiring crew to score games and take his turn on the bases, but MLB has been reluctant to incur the increased cost. More recently, there have been suggestions to move the official scorer out of the press box and closer to the field behind the plate to get the best view of the game. MLB has conceded that this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea, but it is not currently feasible because of the design of most stadiums in the league.|$|E

Within her Order, she emphasised that her followers discover their own personal relationship with the angelic beings, including Lumiel. Montalban considered astrology to be a central part of her religious worldview, and always maintained that one <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> magician only if they had mastered astrology. Her correspondence course focused around the seven planetary bodies that were known in the ancient world and the angelic beings that she associated with them: Michael (Sun), Gabriel (Moon), Samael (Mars), Raphael (Mercury), Sachiel (Jupiter), Anael (Venus) and Cassiel (Saturn). Each of these beings was in turn associated with certain days, hours, minerals, plants, and animals, each of which could be used in the creation of talismans that invoked the angelic power. Montalban disliked the theatrical use of props and rites in ceremonial magic, such as that performed by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, preferring a more simplistic use of ritual.|$|E

Barlow called the scenes [...] "really heartfelt stuff", and explained that Ste saw no problem with Rae having the baby, as he already had a son and considered himself a good father, whereas it was [...] "a bigger deal" [...] for Rae, who was childless. Discussing Rae and Ste's relationship, Barlow said that Rae truly loved Ste, {{and that they had}} a special connection formed through the hardships they had faced together. Despite this, Rae rebuffed Ste's attempt to rekindle their relationship. Barlow said that her character could not return to Ste because she knew that he was gay, that Rae was [...] "determined to keep the baby" [...] and wanted to prove that she <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> single mother.

500|$|The MCC team to Australia {{was led by}} Arthur Gilligan. In {{the opening}} matches, Chapman was cheered by the crowds who remembered his {{achievements}} on the last tour, but failed to make any significant scores. His first big innings came against Victoria; he made 72 runs out of 111 scored while he was batting and played a large part in a win for the MCC. Against Queensland in the following match, he scored 80 in 70 minutes and then hit 93 against a representative Australian XI. He was selected {{for the first four}} Tests of the five-match series. Batting aggressively, he made several substantial scores but only once passed fifty— in the third Test, he scored 58, his first Test half century. During the same Test, Gilligan strained a muscle while bowling and had to leave the field; Chapman took over as captain. England lost the first three matches, giving Australia an insurmountable lead in the series, but won the fourth. Chapman was left out of the side for the final Test. In the series, he scored 185 runs at an average of 30.83, and critics were divided as to his ability and effectiveness. The former Australian captain Monty Noble believed Chapman <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> batsman if he curbed his aggression but The Cricketer considered his technique to be faulty. Wisden did not judge Chapman a complete failure and noted that he [...] "made useful scores at times". In all first-class games, Chapman scored 625 runs at 34.72. Although Chapman had a mixed time on the cricket field, the tour was a success for him socially.|$|E
