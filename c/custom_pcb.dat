This system detects the passage of a pill or capsule embedded with a small permanent magnet as a tracer through the esophagus upon ingestion. As a result, a signal representing a “dose ingestion event ” is generated and wirelessly transmitted to a data delivery device (PDA), which is carried on the patient’s body. A software application running on the PDA time/date stamps the event and stores it for later retrieval by a physician. This technology provides a safe, con-venient, low-cost, and accurate detection mechanism that helps patients adhere with their prescribed medication regimens.

These improvements have paralleled developments in analog sampling technology that makes fast waveform digitizing of photodetector signals an attractive alternative to <b>custom</b> <b>PCB</b> and IC designs. Waveform digitization offers a flexible means for evaluating and implementing more complex signal processing algorithms. We used a commercial 1 GHz 2 Gs/s waveform digitizing system to acquire coincident pulses from LYSO and LaBr 3 (5 %Ce) scintillator crystals coupled to a fast PMT. By measuring the time pickoff based on a linear fit to the rising edge of the pulse, we show an improvement in coincident timing resolution from ~ 200 ps to ~ 80 ps FWHM for LaBr 3 (5 %Ce) coupled to Photonis XP 20 D 0 PMTs, and from ~ 160 ps to ~ 80 ps Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) for LaBr 3 (5 %Ce) coupled to Hamamatsu H 4998 PMTs. Our results show a consistent improvement in timing resolution as well as reduced sensitivity to signal risetime as compared to leading edge (LE) pickoff techniques.

A novel material for neural interfaces, glassy carbon (GC) provides tunable stiffness and impedance, reducing mechanical strain on brain tissue and offering optimized charge injection capabilities. GC is often used in electrochemical reactions due to its high stability and resistance to corrosion.

30|$|For the {{implementation}} of an RTM for the TrustCAM prototype we therefore chose a different approach that is shown in Figure 5 (c). The SYS_BOOT pins of the OMAP allow to force the ROM code to request the second bootloader stage from UART 3 as a first boot device. This pin configuration can easily be hardwired in a <b>custom</b> <b>PCB</b> design. In our design we use a trusted building block which {{is connected to the}} OMAP's UART 3 and answers the download request. This could be a one-time programmable memory together with minimal, additional logic. For our prototype, we realized this component with a microcontroller that downloads the second stage (X-Loader) bootloader. Once X-Loader has been downloaded, the application on the microcontroller terminates and no further interaction between the OMAP CPU and the microcontroller is possible until the next reboot of the system. Allowing no further communication between the two systems is important since it ensures that a potential attacker who gains access to the system that runs on the OMAP CPU, cannot access or modify the X-Loader located on the microcontroller. Compared to modifying the ROM code, our prototype approach provides no resistance against hardware attacks. With full physical access to a camera, it is easy to change the boot procedure and prevent the correct establishment of the chain of trust. As stated in Section 2, hardware attacks are not in the focus of our current work. We nevertheless believe that the proposed mechanism to establish the RTM can still be valuable for legacy devices especially when combined with the Trusted Lifebeat described in Section 5.2. Hardware attacks often cannot be performed on a running system or require a reboot to become effective. The lifebeat allows operators to detect such unexpected events and initiate further actions like retrieval and inspection of the camera.|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{prototype}} of an electronic bi-directional interface between the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) and a neuro-controlled hand prosthesis is presented. The system is composed of two Integrated Circuits (ICs) : a standard CMOS device for neural recording and a High Voltage (HV) CMOS device for neural stimulation. The integrated circuits have been realized in two different 0. 35 μm CMOS processes available fromAustriaMicroSystem(AMS). The recoding IC incorporates 8 channels each including the analog front-end and the A/D conversion based on a sigma delta architecture. It has a total area of 16. 8 mm 2 and exhibits an overall power consumption of 27. 2 mW. The neural stimulation IC is able to provide biphasic current pulses to stimulate 8 electrodes independently. A voltage booster generates a 17 V voltage supply in order to guarantee the programmed stimulation current even in case of high impedances at the electrode-tissue interface {{in the order of}} tens of k­. The stimulation patterns, generated by a 5 -bit current DAC, are programmable in terms of amplitude, frequency and pulse width. Due to the huge capacitors of the implemented voltage boosters, the stimulation IC has a wider area of 18. 6 mm 2. In addition, a maximum power consumption of 29 mW was measured. Successful in-vivo experiments with rats having a TIME electrode implanted in the sciatic nerve were carried out, showing the capability of recording neural signals in the tens of microvolts, with a global noise of 7 μVrms, and to selectively elicit the tibial and plantarmuscles using different active sites of the electrode. In order to get a completely implantable interface, a biocompatible and biostable package was designed. It hosts the developed ICs with the minimal electronics required for their proper operation. The package consists of an alumina tube closed at both extremities by two ceramic caps hermetically sealed on it. Moreover, the two caps serve as substrate for the hermetic feedthroughs to enable the device powering and data exchange with the external digital controller implemented on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) board. The package has an outer diameter of 7 mm and a total length of 26 mm. In addition, a humidity and temperature sensor was also included inside the package to allow future hermeticity and life-time estimation tests. Moreover, a wireless, wearable and non-invasive EEG recording system is proposed in order to improve the control over the artificial limb,by integrating the neural signals recorded from the PNS with those directly acquired from the brain. To first investigate the system requirements, a Component-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) device was designed. It includes a low-power 8 - channel acquisition module and a Bluetooth (BT) transceiver to transmit the acquired data to a remote platform. It was designed with the aimof creating a cheap and user-friendly system that can be easily interfaced with the nowadays widely spread smartphones or tablets by means of a mobile-based application. The presented system, validated through in-vivo experiments, allows EEG signals recording at different sample rates and with a maximum bandwidth of 524 Hz. It was realized on a 19 cm 2 <b>custom</b> <b>PCB</b> with a maximum power consumption of 270 mW...|$|E
40|$|The recent advancements in neuroprosthetics {{have pushed}} forward the {{development}} of new implantable electronic interfaces between the Peripheral Neural System (PNS) and a robotic limb [1]. One of the main advantages of the neuroprostheses is the possibility to restore the sensory feedback to the patient. This is possible thanks tocustom designed devices able to transduce the external information, picked up by sensors collocated on the robotic limb, into electrical currents to be injected through the nerve [2]. In this paper, a neural stimulator able to deliver bi-phasic current pulses to eight different channels is presented. An Integrated Circuit (IC), implemented in a HV 0. 35 µm technology from AMS has been realized and successfully tested. The impedance at the electrode-tissue interface is highly variable and degrades with time, therefore a high voltage supply is needed to guarantee the selected stimulation current even in case of high impedance contact [3]. For this reason, a voltage booster has been introduced in the design to provide a highvoltage supply to the stimulator output stage. Fig. 1 represents the block diagram of our system: the stimulation currents are generated by 6 -bit current DACs implemented in a low voltage domain tosave power and area. The current is then mirrored into a high voltage output stage, powered by the voltage generated by the booster. Finally, the current is injected into the patient nerve by means of intrafascicular electrodes [4]. The current must be generated avoiding charge accumulation at the tissue interface, in fact, this can cause severe damages to the cells. Bi-phasic waveforms prevent this risk balancing the current injected in the first phase with a second opposite phase. A third phase, in which the electrode terminals are shorted together, has been added to eliminate any residual charge. The circuit used to realize this pattern and the pulse diagram are shown, respectively, in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. The current can be programmed via-PC by the user in terms of amplitude, pulse width and period as indicated in Table 1. The experimental setup used to test the stimulator (Fig. 4) is made up of a <b>custom</b> <b>PCB,</b> that hosts the IC, and a Xilinx FPGA Spartan- 6 LX 45, used to configure the IC and to manage the communication with the PC. The chip occupies an area of 17. 68 mm 2 (the layout is represented in Fig. 5) and consumes 29 mW in high power mode. First, the capability of the voltage booster to generate programmable voltages has been tested. Fig. 6 shows as a supply voltage up to 15. 8 V can be generated by the booster. The current programmability is shown in Fig. 7, where, using a 10 kΩ resistance to emulate the electrode impedance, a biphasic pulse with different amplitudes has been obtained. With this impedance, currents up to 326 µAcan be reached. Fig. 8, shows a pulse train acquired choosing a pulse width of 150 µs and a frequency of 400 Hz. All the results confirm the system capability to properly deliver the programmed stimulation currents...|$|E

Originally developed for SAUC-E 2006, the vehicle has been significantly upgraded for the 2007 competition; the propulsion system has been replaced, resulting in a more efficient and highly reliable system, the pressure vessel has been redesigned to reduce weight and the vehicles software has been redeveloped to improve {{the autonomy of the}} vehicle. The design of the vessel focused on a faired hydrodynamic shape encasing an extruded aluminium frame supporting the vessels propulsion system and two central pressure vessels. The autonomous control system is undertaken through various <b>custom</b> built <b>PCBs,</b> off-the-shelf components and a central mini ITX computer running a specially developed autonomy program based in the MATLAB environment. Sensing is undertaken through the use of waterproof cameras, a compass, a pressure sensor, and a three axis gyroscope and accelerometer. Propulsion is achieved using a pair of side mounted horizontal rim driven thrusters to provide surge and yaw control in the horizontal plane and two vertical rim driven tunnel thrusters at the bow and stern of the vessel to provide control in heave and pitch...|$|R
40|$|Wearable {{robotics}} {{for assistance}} and rehabilitation {{are not yet}} considered commercially mainstream products, {{and as a result}} have not yet seen advanced controls systems and interfaces. Consequently, the available technology is mostly adapted from systems used in parallel technologies, rather than custom applications intended for human use. This study concerns itself with the design and development of a custom control system for a 2 -degree of freedom powered upper extremity orthosis capable of driving elbow flexion/extension 135 º and humeral rotation 95 º. The orthosis has been evaluated for use as both a long-term assistive technology device for persons with disabilities, and as a short-term rehabilitative tool for persons recovering injury. The target demographics for such a device vary in age, cognitive ability and physical function, thus requiring several input parameters requiring consideration. This study includes a full evaluation of the potential users of the device, as well as parameter considerations that are required during the design phase. The final control system is capable of driving each DOF independently or simultaneously, for a more realistic and natural coupled-motion, with proportional control by pulse-width modulation. The dual-axis joystick interface wirelessly transmits to the 1. 21 pound control pack which houses a <b>custom</b> microcontroller-driven <b>PCB</b> and 1800 milliamp-hour lithium-ion rechargeable battery capable of delivering 4 hours of running time. Upon integration with the 2 DOF orthosis device, a user may complete full range of motion with up to 5 pounds in their hand in less than 7 seconds, providing full functionality to complete acts of daily living, thus improving quality of life...|$|R
