40|$|Abstract—A three {{dimensional}} {{hydrodynamic model}} based on triple coordinate systems is developed to predict translation and orientation of falling rigid cylinder {{through the water}} column: earth-fixed coordinate (E-coordinate), cylinder’s main-axis following coordinate (M-coordinate), and hydrodynamic force following coordinate (F-coordinate). Use of the triple coordinate systems and the transforms among them leads to the simplification of the dynamical system. The body and buoyancy forces and their moments are easily calculated using the E-coordinate system. The hydrodynamic forces (such as the drag and lift forces) and their moments are easily computed using the F-coordinate. The cylinder’s moments of gyration are simply represented using the M-coordinate. A recursive model is developed {{on the base of}} the triple coordinate transform to predict the cylinder’s translation and orientation. To evaluate the recursive model, a cylinder-drop experiment was conducted at the Naval Postgraduate School swimming pool in June 2001. Comparison between the modeled and observed results shows a great potential of using the triple coordinate transform.

40|$|The {{strengthening}} technique using {{advanced composite}} materials has been implemented worldwide into the retrofit of existing concrete structures for static and seismic loading. But, {{there is still}} a gap in knowledge regarding the effect of impact and explosion loading on concrete structures strengthened with composite materials. This situation is especially difficult since many serious problems exist in material modeling, load definition, and selecting effective approaches for addressing the behavior of complicated geometrical domains in a structure. A series of twenty-seven concrete beams were prepared and tested to investigate the behavior of concrete beams strengthened with composite materials. Twenty-five beams were tested with impact load induced by a steel <b>cylinder</b> <b>drop</b> weight; two beams were statically loaded as control specimens. Two of the twenty-seven beams were unretrofitted, one for impact test group and the other for static test. Two types composite materials were used in strengthening, Kevlar and carbon fabrics. Each type of fabric had two different weights. Five beams were reinforced with steel bars and the other beams without steel bars. Investigation during testing included monitoring reaction force at support of simply supported beam, history of strain vs. time in composite laminates, variation of beam stiffness and deflection, crack and failure modes and stress concentration at the cut-off end of composite laminates. The test results revealed that bonding composite laminates to concrete beam can significantly improve the performance of concrete structures to resist impact load, increase the cracking, flexural strength, and residual stiffness of beam and reduce number of cracks, crack width and maximum deflection. The residual stiffness of strengthened beam after first impact was two to three times of that of un-retrofitted beam; the maximum deflection decreased 30 to 40 %. The gain depends on the type and weight of composite laminates. Comparing to the static test results, the ultimate deflection and crack width were smaller than those of beam under static load. But, the maximum reaction force was three to four times larger than that under static load. The residual stiffness of strengthened beam after first impact can be calculated using a regression equation. The impact force can be obtained with a semi-empirical equation, which is derived from Spring-Mass models and modified by test results. From flexural wave theory, an equation has been developed for predicting the deflection of beam caused by impact loading. Based on the test and analytical results, a retrofit technique and design guidelines have been proposed. To control failure modes of strengthened beam, the minimum and balanced ratio of composite plate reinforcement have been derived...|$|E

50|$|Most {{technical}} and overhead-environment divers will maintain {{the rule of}} thirds as the least conservative option when diving sidemount. Because air-sharing will remain a possibility while a second diver is present, it is considered good practice that both cylinders retain independent reserves of sufficient gas for both divers to reach the surface safely from any point in the planned dive. {{one third of the}} capacity of the cylinder is considered a simple rule of thumb reserve sufficient for most circumstances, but there are times when it is not enough and times when it will be more than enough. The principle of the rule of thirds is that one third of the gas supply is available for the penetration, one third for the return and one third is a reserve which allows for gas sharing on the return. Therefore the dive is turned when either <b>cylinder</b> <b>drops</b> to two thirds of total capacity.|$|R

5000|$|Once {{the flow}} has stopped, the booster is started, {{and as the}} piston withdraws along the cylinder, {{increasing}} the volume between the cylinder head and the piston crown, the pressure in the <b>cylinder</b> will <b>drop,</b> and gas will flow in from the inlet port. On the return cycle, the piston moves toward the cylinder head, decreasing {{the volume of the}} space and compressing the gas until the pressure is sufficient to overcome the pressure in the outlet line and the opening pressure of the outlet valve. At that point, the gas will flow out of the cylinder via the outlet valve and port.|$|R
50|$|An oxygen {{concentrator}} has an air compressor, two cylinders filled with zeolite pellets, a pressure equalizing reservoir, and some valves and tubes. In the first half-cycle the first cylinder receives {{air from the}} compressor, which lasts about 3 seconds. During that time the pressure in the first cylinder rises from atmospheric to about 1.5 times normal atmospheric pressure (typically 20 psi/138 kPa gauge, or 2.36 atmospheres absolute) and the zeolite becomes saturated with nitrogen. As the first cylinder reaches near pure oxygen (there are small amounts of argon, CO2, water vapour, radon and other minor atmospheric components) in the first half-cycle, a valve opens and the oxygen enriched gas flows to the pressure equalizing reservoir, which connects to the patient's oxygen hose. At {{the end of the}} first half of the cycle, there is another valve position change so that the air from the compressor is directed to the 2nd cylinder. Pressure in the first <b>cylinder</b> <b>drops</b> as the enriched oxygen moves into the reservoir, allowing the nitrogen to be desorbed back into gas. Part way through the second half of the cycle there is another valve position change to vent the gas in the first cylinder back into the ambient atmosphere, keeping the concentration of oxygen in the pressure equalizing reservoir from falling below about 90%. The pressure in the hose delivering oxygen from the equalizing reservoir is kept steady by a pressure reducing valve.|$|R
25|$|If {{the water}} {{in direct contact with}} the {{pressure}} transfer mechanism (diaphragm or piston and the spring balancing the internal pressure) of the regulator freezes, the mechanism will be locked in the position at which the freezing takes place, as the ice will prevent the movement required to close. Since the cooling takes place during flow through the regulator, it is common for the freezing to occur when the first stage valve is open, and this will freeze the valve open, allowing a continuous flow through the first stage. This will cause the inter-stage pressure to rise until the second stage opens to relieve the excess pressure, the pressure relief valve on the first stage opens, or a low pressure hose or fitting bursts. All of these effects will allow the flow through the first stage to continue, so the cooling will continue, and this will keep the ice causing the problem frozen. To break the cycle it is necessary to stop the gas flow or expose the ice to a heat source capable of melting it. While underwater, it is unlikely to find a heat source to thaw the ice and stopping the flow is only option. Clearly the flow will stop when the pressure in the <b>cylinder</b> <b>drops</b> to ambient, but this is undesirable as it means total loss of the breathing gas. The other option is to close the cylinder valve, shutting off the pressure at the source. Once this is done, the ice will normally melt as heat from the surrounding water is absorbed by the slightly colder ice, and once the ice has melted, the regulator will function again.|$|R
5000|$|A small drop in {{brake fluid}} {{level in the}} master {{cylinder}} reservoir can be [...] "topped up" [...] but if the level consistently drops, the cause should be investigated and repaired. Brake fluid level in the master <b>cylinder</b> will <b>drop</b> as the linings (pads or shoes) wear and the calipers or wheel cylinders extend further to compensate. Overspill from pushing back pistons should be avoided, because glycol based fluid will quickly lift or strip paints and other coatings on contact (it can be removed by quickly washing with water, not wiping). Brake fluid level may also be low because of a leak, which {{could result in a}} loss of hydraulic pressure and consequently a significant loss of braking ability. Modern cars have redundant hydraulic circuits (two separate circuits) to ensure against total hydraulic failure.|$|R

40|$|PLIF {{has been}} used to observe the {{in-cylinder}} transport of unburned fuel that, while trapped in the ring-land and ring-groove crevices, survives combustion in the propagating flame. Away from the top-ring gap, we detect a wall-jet comprised of unburned charge exiting the top ring-land crevice opening. At the location of the top-ring gap, we observed unburned fuel lying in the cool boundary layer along the cylinder wall during the later stages of the expansion stroke. This layer is scraped into the roll-up vortex during the exhaust stroke. These data lead us to conclude that away from the end gap, unburned, high pressure charge, trapped between the two compression rings escapes as a wall jet after ring-reversal near the bottom center. Conversely, at the ring gap, when the <b>cylinder</b> pressure <b>drops</b> below the pressure between the compression rings, the trapped charge escapes through the gap and forms a thin layer on the cylinder wall...|$|R
40|$|The {{lubrication}} form of {{the equations}} governing the flow of a thin liquid film on a horizontal right circular cylinder is derived. The equations are discretized and solved numerically using an alternating-direction implicit algorithm. Simulations demonstrate that {{the transition from a}} uniform coating to a final configuration of distinct drops follows a similar evolution {{for a wide range of}} cylinder radii. Initially gravity-driven drainage from the top and sides of the cylinder dampens the formation of any axial disturbances; only when this drainage slows do longitudinal waves begin to develop along the bottom of the cylinder. These waves grow rapidly and a series of alternating primary and satellite drops form during the transition from a linear to a nonlinear wave growth regime. This is followed by a slow drainage between adjacent drops as the drop pattern approaches an equilibrium state where surface tension forces exactly balance gravitational forces in each discrete <b>drop.</b> For large <b>cylinder</b> radii, these <b>drops</b> are localized on the bottom of the cylinder, while, for sufficiently small <b>cylinder</b> radii, these <b>drops</b> may wrap around the entire circumference of the cylinder.

25|$|Unfortunately, {{the model}} was not free from shortcomings. Since 1973, the growing problem of air {{pollution}} (specially in Mexico City) forced the Mexican government to schedule the beginning of emission certification to all engines produced in the country, which would take effect in 1974. This would affect all high compression engines of all marques. For this reason, the 258 cu in six <b>cylinder</b> had <b>dropped</b> from 8.5:1 to 8.3:1 compression ratio in the change between 1973 and 1974.

This meant a final 7.6:1 compression ratio for the 258 cu in six engine for {{the second half of the}} year production of the 1974 Rambler American Rally. For this reason, the aforementioned model along with the 1975 American Rally became the lowest performing examples of VAM's original compact sporty model, ending even below the stock 155hp 232 cu in six cylinder of the 1969 Rambler American Rally and the stock 232 1970-1972 Rambler American two-door sedans. The improvements in the form of the four-speed transmission and electronic ignition were insufficient to overcome the problem.|$|R
