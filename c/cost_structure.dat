25|$|The {{image on}} the left depicts in {{extensive}} form a Stackelberg game. The payoffs are shown on the right. This example is fairly simple. There is a basic <b>cost</b> <b>structure</b> involving only marginal cost (there is no fixed cost). The demand function is linear and price elasticity of demand is 1. However, it illustrates the leader's advantage.|$|E
25|$|For book publishers, {{production}} and distribution are the main focuses of the economic activity. Here the <b>cost</b> <b>structure</b> of manufacturing is of high importance. The amount of first copy costs in relation to total revenue is around 41%. Marketing costs are about 12% and administrative costs average 14%, with a profit margin of approximately 5%.|$|E

Twenty years later he attended a meeting hosted by John Chapman to campaign against the Booksellers Association, still a cartel.|$|E

40|$|Economists have {{difficulties}} to conceptualise and model {{the relationship between}} macroeconomic policy and industry change. This paper explores the relationships between industry <b>cost</b> <b>structures</b> and macroeconomic regimes in central and east European countries (CEECs). It finds that the <b>cost</b> <b>structures</b> are more homogenous within industries than within countries. Changes in <b>cost</b> <b>structures</b> are dominantly intra-industry, i. e. unrelated to changes in industry structures though in some countries structural and specialisation effects are also significant. The paper links the intensity of changes in industry <b>cost</b> <b>structures</b> with a composite measure of macroeconomic stability. In the case of five CEECs, it finds {{that there is a}} country-specific relationship between changes in costs and macroeconomic stability. Based on these findings the paper provides arguments for integration of macroeconomic and industrial (technology) policies...|$|R
25|$|Many hedges do {{not involve}} exotic {{financial}} instruments or derivatives such as the married put. A natural hedge is an investment that reduces the undesired risk by matching cash flows (i.e. revenues and expenses). For example, an exporter to the United States faces a risk {{of changes in the}} value of the U.S. dollar and chooses to open a production facility in that market to match its expected sales revenue to its <b>cost</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tariff {{setting is}} the {{responsibility}} of Water Services Boards and Water Service Providers according to operation and maintenance costs. Tariffs have to be approved by WASREB, which can also mandate a WSB to formulate a tariff adjustment. There are three types of tariff adjustments, as described in the Tariff Guidelines: Regular Tariff Adjustments based on the WSPs' business plan; Extraordinary Tariff Adjustments when the <b>cost</b> <b>structure</b> undergoes significant changes; Automatic Tariff Adjustments every 12 months which might be part of a service provision agreement with a WSP.|$|E
25|$|Pandora's <b>cost</b> <b>structure</b> {{is highly}} variable, with content {{acquisition}} costs representing roughly 50% of total costs. There are three main {{costs associated with}} content acquisition. First, SoundExchange collects content fees on behalf of labels or artists on the recording themselves. These {{are by far the}} largest content acquisition costs. Second, Pandora pays licensing fees to agencies such as BMI, ASCAP, or SESAC in order to compensate composers, songwriters and publishers. Lastly, Pandora also pays Rovi for song and artist information; this has recently been structured as a flat monthly fee.|$|E

25|$|Estonia has had {{a market}} economy {{since the end of}} the 1990s and one of the highest per capita income levels in Eastern Europe. Proximity to the Scandinavian and Finnish markets, its {{location}} between the East and West, competitive <b>cost</b> <b>structure</b> and a highly skilled labour force have been the major Estonian comparative advantages in the beginning of the 2000s (decade). As the largest city, Tallinn has emerged as a financial centre and the Tallinn Stock Exchange joined recently with the OMX system. The current government has pursued tight fiscal policies, resulting in balanced budgets and low public debt.|$|E
25|$|The “New Continental” began {{emerging}} {{while in}} bankruptcy. With its <b>cost</b> <b>structure</b> {{in line with}} any post deregulation upstart carrier, the airline began competing effectively with legacy carriers. By May 1984, Continental was operating 83 of its 105 aircraft, which had been mostly grounded upon filing for bankruptcy. Though operating near capacity, it was doing so with nearly half the 12,000 employees, on half the wages, than prior to bankruptcy. By the summer of 1984, the Lorenzo team had filled many of the positions downsized during the strike, and employment had reached 9,000 with a route system served 67 destinations. Planes were averaging a 67% load factor, amongst {{the highest in the}} industry. New Continental’s low-cost carrier strategy was beginning to bear fruit.|$|E

He oversaw the establishment of the corporate planning system and the production of the ABS's first Corporate Plan in 1987. He championed the adoption of PC and Internet technologies to reduce the <b>cost</b> <b>structure</b> in the ABS and improved the readability of statistical output. In 1986, he became Deputy Australian Statistician.|$|E

25|$|In March 1999 Ansett and Air New Zealand became full Star Alliance members. 1999 {{also saw}} {{the start of a}} long and {{confusing}} battle over ownership of Ansett. Ansett remained profitable but was having increasing difficulty in finding a way to rationalise its <b>cost</b> <b>structure,</b> and badly needed a capital injection to replace its elderly fleet. Of the two half owners, News Limited was more interested in selling out and investing the proceeds in other industries, while Air New Zealand did not have the funds to spare: with 102 aircraft, nearly 15,000 staff and a turnover of US$2.3 billion (compared with Air New Zealand's 72 aircraft, 9,200 staff and US$1.8 billion turnover) Ansett's need for capital was greater than Air New Zealand's ability to provide it—particularly given the age of Air New Zealand's own fleet.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, the {{repeated}} operational breaks and high {{costs related to}} the Bergen Line past Finse was a constant problem for NSB and in 1983 the director, Robert Nordén launched {{the idea of a}} tunnel through the mountain. He was backed by the engineering staff in NSB, who felt that a tunnel would be a simple way of solving many of the challenges relating to the railway operations. Estimates calculated the cost of the investment at , including the upgrade of part of the line east of Finse Station. In addition to the argument for better regularity on the Bergen Line, NSB pointed out that the <b>cost</b> <b>structure</b> of railway operations had changed, making it relatively more expensive to operate snow sheds, that required rebuilding about every twenty years, than to build a tunnel, that would be excavated using heavy and automated machinery. NSB launched the idea to start construction after Oslo Central Station was scheduled for completion in 1989.|$|E
500|$|In February 2011, {{protests in}} Libya began against long-time {{dictator}} Muammar Gaddafi {{as part of}} the Arab Spring. They soon turned violent. In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the Arab League, and a resolution passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate. In response to the unanimous passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, Gaddafi—who had previously vowed to [...] "show no mercy" [...] to the rebels of Benghazi—announced an immediate cessation of military activities, yet reports came in that his forces continued shelling Misrata. The next day, on Obama's orders, the U.S. military took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government's air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone, including the use of Tomahawk missiles, B-2 Spirits, and fighter jets. Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all of its 28 members, NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed Operation Unified Protector. Some Representatives questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its <b>cost,</b> <b>structure</b> and aftermath.|$|E

This study therefore seeks to investigate the problem of inefficiency in the Nigerian Insurance market from the perspective of their <b>cost</b> <b>structures.</b> The study takes advantage of secondary data of financial reports of thirty randomly selected insurance firms which span over a period of ten years and applied transcendental logarithm model to evaluate their performance from the <b>cost</b> <b>structures</b> strategy. The results indicate that only large scale firms enjoy cost saving advantages. Twenty percent firms sampled belong to this category.
