After assembly was completed, the entire stack was moved from the VAB to the launch pad using the Crawler Transporter (CT).

The <b>crawlerways</b> used for transporting launch vehicles from the VAB to the twin pads of KSC are also being extensively renovated for the SLS program.|$|R
5000|$|The crawler is {{controlled}} from two control cabs located {{at either end}} of the vehicle, and travels along the 3.5 mi <b>crawlerway</b> at a maximum speed of 1 mph loaded, or 2 mph unloaded. The average trip time from the VAB along the <b>Crawlerway</b> to Launch Complex 39 is about five hours. [...] Each <b>crawlerway</b> is 7 ft deep and covered with Alabama and Tennessee river rock for its low friction properties to reduce the possibility of sparks. In 2000, NASA unearthed and restored an Apollo-era segment of the <b>crawlerway</b> to provide access to a high-bay building in order to provide protection from a hurricane.|$|E

50|$|The <b>crawlerway</b> is {{composed}} of two 40 ft wide lanes, separated by a 50 ft median. The top layer is of Tennessee river gravel 4in thick on the straight sections and 8in thick on curves. Tennessee river rock was chosen due to its anti spark properties. Beneath that is 4 ft of graded, crushed stone, resting on two layers of fill. As of 2013 a project to repair and upgrade the <b>crawlerway</b> is in process, {{the first time since}} it was constructed that the foundation will be repaired. Additional rock has been added to the surface on June 2014.|$|E
50|$|There are 24 {{historic}} properties {{outside of}} these historic districts, including the Space Shuttle Atlantis, Vehicle Assembly Building, <b>Crawlerway,</b> and Operations and Checkout Building. KSC has one National Historic Landmark, 78 National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) listed or eligible sites, and 100 Archaeological Sites.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Crawlerway</b> was {{designed}} to support {{the weight of a}} Saturn V rocket and payload, plus its Launch Umbilical Tower and Mobile Launcher Platform, atop a Crawler-transporter during the Apollo Program. It was used from 1981 - 2011 to transport the lighter Space Shuttles to their launch pads.|$|E
50|$|Historically, the Banana River was a {{continuous}} waterway that completely separated Merritt Island from Cape Canaveral (which was {{considered part of}} the mainland until the construction of the Haulover Canal). In 1964, the <b>Crawlerway</b> was built at Kennedy Space Center, connecting Merritt Island to Cape Canaveral and dividing the Banana River into northern and southern lagoons.|$|E

50|$|Launch Complex 39 is {{composed}} of three launch padsâ€”39A, 39B and 39C, a Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB), a <b>Crawlerway</b> used by crawler-transporters to carry Mobile Launcher Platforms between the VAB and the pads, Orbiter Processing Facility buildings, a Launch Control Center which contains the firing rooms, a news facility famous for the iconic countdown clock seen in television coverage and photos, and various logistical and operational support buildings.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Crawlerway</b> is a 130 ft wide [...] double pathway at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It runs {{between the}} Vehicle Assembly Building {{and the two}} launch pads at Launch Complex 39. It has a length of 3.5 mi to Pad 39A and 4.2 mi to Pad 39B. A seven-foot (2 m) bed of stones lies beneath a layer of asphalt and a surface made of Tennessee river rocks.|$|E
50|$|Merritt Island is a peninsula. The {{construction}} of the <b>Crawlerway</b> in the north (for NASA space vehicles {{to move to the}} launch pad over Banana Creek) connected Merritt Island to a mainland peninsula. Merritt Island is still considered a natural island. To the west and south it is separated by the Indian River Lagoon and the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. The east side of Merritt Island splits and is divided by Sykes Creek and Newfound Harbor. They, in turn, are separated by the Banana River Lagoon from Cocoa Beach, Florida.|$|E
50|$|The crawler-transporters, {{formally}} {{known as}} the Missile Crawler Transporter Facilities, are a pair of tracked vehicles used to transport spacecraft from NASA's Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) along the <b>Crawlerway</b> to Launch Complex 39. They were originally used to transport the Saturn IB and Saturn V rockets during the Apollo, Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz programs. They were then used to transport Space Shuttles from 1981 to 2011. The crawler-transporters carry vehicles on the Mobile Launcher Platform, and after each launch return to the pad to take the platform back to the VAB.|$|E
50|$|At the time, {{the highest}} {{numbered}} launch pad on CCAFS was Launch Complex 37; when the lunar launch complex was designed, it was designated as Launch Complex 39. It {{was designed to}} handle launches of the Saturn V rocket, {{at the time the}} largest, most powerful rocket then designed, required to take Apollo to the Moon. Initial plans included four pads (five were considered) evenly spaced 8700 ft apart to avoid damage {{in the event of an}} explosion on the pad. Three were scheduled for construction (A-C, to the southeast) and two (D and E, west and north) would have been built at a later date. The numbering of the pads at the time was from north to south, with the northernmost being 39A, and the southernmost being 39C. Pad 39A was never built, and 39C became 39A in 1963. With today's numbering, 39C would have been north of 39B, and 39D would have been due west of 39C. Pad 39E would have been due north of the mid-distance between 39C and 39D, with 39E forming the top of a triangle, and equidistant from 39C and 39D. The <b>Crawlerway</b> was built with the additional pads in mind. This is the reason the <b>Crawlerway</b> turns as it heads to Pad B; continuing straight from that turn would have led to the additional pads.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, SpaceX built a large Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF) {{just outside}} the {{perimeter}} of the existing launch pad in order to house both the Falcon 9, and the Falcon Heavy, rockets, and their associated hardware and payloads, during preparation for flight. Both types of launch vehicles will be transported from the HIF to the launch pad aboard a Transporter Erector (TE) which will ride on rails up the former <b>Crawlerway</b> path. Also in 2015, the launch mount for the Falcon Heavy was constructed on Pad 39A over the existing infrastructure. The work on both the HIF building, and the pad, were substantially complete by late 2015. A rollout test of the new Transporter/Erector (TE) was conducted in November 2015.|$|E
50|$|The Falcon rockets will {{be transported}} from the HIF to {{the launch pad}} aboard a Transporter Erector (TE) which will ride on rails up the former <b>crawlerway</b> path. In February 2016, it was {{reported}} that the pad was completed and activated indicating it is ready for launches of Falcon 9 Full Thrust. The first SpaceX launch from LC-39A occurred in February 2017, followed by a successful first-stage landing at Landing Zone 1. Further work will be needed to support Falcon Heavy and crewed launches which is expected to take at least 60 days and is currently planned to occur after Cape Canaveral LC-40 is back in operation, which has a target date of August 2017. SpaceX's first crewed space missions are expected to launch in late 2018 from the Kennedy LC-39A launch pad.|$|E
