After laminating that he lost the episode, he sets off to find it using a treasure map. Throughout several difficulties, he eventually finds a slightly dirty VHS tape which holds the episode. He then returns home in glee, and watches the episode. However, the tape only shows a clip of SpongeBob doing a series of walk cycles to techno music before abruptly showing the SMPTE <b>color</b> <b>bars.</b> Patchy gets angry, thinking SpongeBob betrayed him, and gets rid of his SpongeBob merchandise, including his SpongeBob underwear, which results in him running away. The real episode then begins to start playing, and Patchy returns, fixes all of his stuff, then enjoys the episode.|$|E
50|$|The HMIS <b>Color</b> <b>Bar</b> {{is similar}} to the fire diamond, created by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). Before 2002 the fire diamond and the <b>color</b> <b>bar</b> both had {{sections}} colored blue, red, white, and yellow. After April 2002, with the release of HMIS III, yellow in the <b>color</b> <b>bar</b> (which stood for reactivity) was replaced by orange, standing for physical hazard. The fire diamond is designed for emergencies when information about the effects of short, or acute, exposure is needed. The <b>color</b> <b>bar</b> is not for emergencies and is used to convey broader health warning information.|$|R

2500|$|... {{also known}} by its French {{language}} title [...] "Beaucoup de Bruit pour Rien", is a song by Japanese rock band Tokyo Jihen, led by musician Ringo Sheena. It was a promotional song for the band's final original release, the extended play <b>Color</b> <b>Bars,</b> released on January 18, 2012.|$|E
2500|$|In early 2012, Sheena's band Tokyo Jihen disbanded, and {{released}} {{a string of}} releases, including the extended play <b>Color</b> <b>Bars,</b> the live compilation album Tokyo Collection, the B-side collection Shin'ya Waku, and performed their farewell tour, Bon Voyage. On May 16, 2012, Sheena released her first post-Tokyo Jihen solo work, the digital single [...] "Jiyū e Michizure." [...] This song acted as the theme song for the TBS drama Ataru, starring Masahiro Nakai.|$|E
2500|$|The song {{features}} {{lyrics and}} music by Sheena. The other <b>Color</b> <b>Bars</b> songs were songs that had existed before the release that were suggested {{but did not}} appear on other releases. [...] "Kon'ya wa Karasawagi" [...] was the final song, which Sheena struggled over on {{the best way to}} express. She wrote the lyrics in the image of Tokyo, and wrote the melody in the most natural way she composes songs, without deviating.|$|E

40|$|Comparison {{of crystal}} {{oscillators}} to the rubidium stabilized color burst is made easy and inexpensive {{by use of}} the <b>color</b> <b>bar</b> phase meter. Required equipment consists of an unmodified color TV receiver, a <b>color</b> <b>bar</b> synthesizer and a stop watch (a wrist watch or clock with sweep second hand may be used with reduced precision). Measurement precision of 1 x 10 to the minus 10 th power can be realized in measurement times of less than two minutes. If the <b>color</b> <b>bar</b> synthesizer were commercially available, user cost should be less than $ 200. 00, exclusive of the TV receiver. Parts cost for the <b>color</b> <b>bar</b> synthesizer which translates the crystal oscillator frequency to 3. 579 MHz and modulates the received RF signal before it is fed to the receiver antenna terminals is about $ 25. 00. A more sophisticated automated version, with precision of 1 x 10 to the minus 11 th power would cost about twice as much...|$|R

2500|$|On April 26, 1986, MacDougall {{worked at}} his shop as normal, and closed at 4:00p.m. EST. After eating dinner, he {{reported}} to Central Florida Teleport with one other engineer on duty. The second engineer left at 6:00p.m., leaving MacDougall {{to operate the}} building on his own. MacDougall oversaw the uplink of the movie Pee-wee's Big Adventure {{as part of the}} evening's programming for the pay-per-view network People's Choice, which used Central Florida Teleport's facilities. After the film ended, he went through his regular routine. Before logging off, MacDougall set up SMPTE <b>color</b> <b>bars</b> and punched buttons on a Microgen MG-100 character generator that placed letters on the television screen. He spent a couple of minutes composing his message. MacDougall began his message with a polite greeting as he did not wish to be insulting. He selected the name [...] "Captain Midnight" [...] from a film he had recently seen: On the Air Live with Captain Midnight (not associated with the popular Captain Midnight radio show of the 1940s).|$|E
2500|$|HBO became {{involved}} in several lawsuits during the 1980s, involving legal statutes imposed by state and city laws that {{would have resulted in}} some programs on HBO and other pay television networks being censored by cable systems, if not forcing the pay services to edit inappropriate content from the programming they aired. In January 1986, HBO became the first satellite-delivered television network to encrypt its signal from unauthorized viewing by way of the Videocipher II system; this initially resulted in a mass lodge of complaints from television receive-only (TVRO) satellite users that previously received HBO's programming without a subscription. The objections by TVRO users over having to now pay for HBO as cable subscribers had long done (requiring dish subscribers to purchase an expensive descrambler to unencrypt the signal) came to a head four months later, as HBO became a victim of broadcast signal intrusion when satellite television dealer John R. MacDougall, a Florida man calling himself [...] "Captain Midnight", redirected a receiver dish towards the network's transponder on Galaxy 1 and intercepted its signal during a movie presentation of The Falcon and the Snowman; MacDougall overrode the telecast of the film with a text-based message placed over SMPTE <b>color</b> <b>bars</b> in protest of the channel's decision to scramble its signal for home satellite subscribers. The Federal Communications Commission subsequently prosecuted MacDougall for committing the intrusion.|$|E

50|$|When {{converting}} {{between the}} various HD and SD formats, it would be correct {{to compensate for the}} differences in the primaries (e.g. between the Rec. 709, EBU Tech 3213, and SMPTE C primaries). In practice, this conversion is rarely performed and such a conversion would create a liability for post production facilities as they would need to ensure that the <b>color</b> <b>bars</b> on all the new masters are redone. Correcting for differences in the primaries would cause the resulting <b>color</b> <b>bars</b> on the converted tape to be inaccurate.
