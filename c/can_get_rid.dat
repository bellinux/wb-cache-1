25|$|Ronnie has a brief {{relationship}} with Dot Branning's (June Brown) grandson, Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett) after {{telling him about}} Danielle's death. Ronnie and Roxy buy 27 Albert Square, after deciding that Phil's house is too crowded, but after revealing that she is pregnant to Phil, Ronnie decides to leave. Ronnie returns several months later, as requested by Peggy {{to try to stop}} Phil and Sharon's wedding, revealing that she is five months pregnant with Charlie's baby. She moves back in with Roxy. Dot, disappointed about the idea of her great-grandchild being born out of wedlock, persuades Charlie to propose to Ronnie. She admits that she has killed a man and, in return, he admits that he is not a police officer and has been lying to Dot about Nick Cotton's (John Altman) death. Nick returns to Walford and reveals himself to Dot. Ronnie tells Charlie that she wants him gone. She threatens Nick, saying that he doesn't know what she's capable of. She asks Phil to give her the money stolen from her and Roxy so she <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of Nick, but he refuses. Ronnie steals all the money in his safe. On their wedding day, Phil finds out about the money, and agrees to kill Nick. He overhears this and angrily cuts the brakes on Ronnie's car. She goes into labour during the wedding reception, and Roxy and Charlie rush her to hospital, but crash the car in the square due to the cut brakes. Ronnie is rushed to hospital in a critical condition, where her son Matthew is delivered by an emergency Caesarean section. She is revived at the last minute, but is placed in a coma for several weeks, before she is finally woken up.|$|E

Parker and Stone {{deliberately}} included several scenes that looked like they might lead to Kenny's death, but they decided because it was Christmas {{that they would not}} kill him. The episode was also the first time Mr. Garrison was portrayed as an anti-semite and racist, particularly when he asks Mayor McDaniels if she <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of all the Mexicans in South Park. Parker said this decision was made because, [...] "Garrison at that point had already shown himself to be the most messed up person in the entire town, and there's obviously so much wrong with him mentally. A person that disturbed being a racist is funny to us." ...|$|E

On his return, he was {{appointed}} the General Officer Commanding (GOC), 26th Infantry Division. While he commanded the division, General K. S. Thimayya was the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS), and Krishna Menon, the defence minister. During Menon's visit to Manekshaw's division, he asked him what he thought of his chief. Manekshaw replied that it was not appropriate for him to think of his chief in that way, and told Menon not to ask anybody again. This annoyed Menon and he told Manekshaw that if he wanted to, he could sack Thimayya, to which Manekshaw replied, [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of him. But then I will get another." [...] This heated conversation with Menon later proved to be a thorn in his career.|$|E
500|$|Lang's {{relationship}} with his curates was generally formal. They were aware of his ambition and felt that he sometimes {{spent too much time}} on his outside interests such as his All Souls Fellowship, but were nevertheless impressed by his efficiency and his powers of oratory. The Church historian Adrian Hastings singles out Portsea under Lang as an example of [...] "extremely disciplined pastoral professionalism". Lang may have realised that he was destined for high office; he is reported to have practised the signature [...] "Cosmo Cantuar" [...] during a relaxed discussion with his curates ("Cantuar" [...] is part of the Archbishop of Canterbury's formal signature). In January 1898 he was invited by Queen Victoria to preach at Osborne House, her Isle of Wight home. Afterwards he talked with the Queen who, Lang records, suggested that he should marry. Lang replied that he could not afford to as his curates cost too much. He added: [...] "If a curate proves unsatisfactory I <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of him. A wife is a fixture." [...] He was summoned on several more occasions and in the following January was appointed an Honorary Chaplain to the Queen. These visits to Osborne were the start of a close association with the Royal Family which lasted for the rest of Lang's life. As one of the Queen's chaplains, he assisted in the funeral arrangements after her death in January 1901.|$|E

500|$|The {{return of}} a wife after 18years results in Michael Henchard's {{downfall}} in Thomas Hardy's novel Mayor of Casterbridge (1886). [...] A bad-tempered, impulsive and cruel husband, feeling burdened by his wife, Henchard sells her to a stranger for five guineas. [...] He becomes a successful businessman and rises {{to the position of}} mayor, but the return of his wife many years later prompts his fall back into penury. [...] The custom was also referred to in the 19th-century French play, Le Marché de Londres. Commenting on the drama and contemporary French attitudes on the custom, in 1846 the writer Angus B. Reach complained: [...] "They reckon up a long and visionary list of our failings [...] would as readily give up their belief in the geographical and physical existence of London, as in the astounding fact that in England a husband sells his wife exactly as he sells his horse or his dog." [...] Such complaints were still commonplace nearly 20years later; in The Book of Days (1864), author Robert Chambers wrote about a case of wife selling in 1832, and noted that [...] "the occasional instances of wife-sale, while remarked by ourselves with little beyond a passing smile, have made a deep impression on our continental neighbours, [...] constantly cite it as an evidence of our low civilisation." [...] Embarrassed by the practice, a legal handbook of 1853 enabled English judges to dismiss wife selling as a myth: [...] "It is a vulgar error that a husband <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of his wife by selling her in the open market with a halter round her neck. Such an act on his part would be severely punished by the local magistrate." [...] Originally published in 1869, Burn's Justice of the Peace and Parish Officer states that [...] "publicly selling or buying a wife is clearly an indictable offence... And many prosecutions against husbands for selling, and others for buying, have recently been sustained, and imprisonment for six months inflicted".|$|E

[...] "We <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of the stereotyped movements and the old hackneyed associations of sound or sense.

Zikode clarified that [...] "Abahlali are not joining DA or any political party. We will remain independent from all kinds of mainstream political parties.

2500|$|A {{common thread}} in the {{argument}} against VSU {{is the notion}} of a campus culture, or the university experience. University has traditionally been a time of broadening horizons, socialising, and political activism. Opponents argue that VSU makes it more difficult for students to have high quality sports grounds, lively music and social venues, and the resources necessary to mount protests and political campaigns, leading to moribund campuses. This was a view expressed by Senator Barnaby Joyce who said the original VSU legislation could lead to [...] "unnecessary collateral damage against sporting facilities and other vital parts of university infrastructure, and we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of compulsory student unionism without affecting you know, the sporting clubs and you know the childcare facilities" [...] Proponents counter that the free-market system rewards venues and establishments which students enjoy and value, and that it lets students choose their own level of contribution to a political cause.|$|E

Vanessa then claims that Jerry only took her to Vermont because he lost so much money. Back in New York, George is celebrating the rising price of his stock, which has increased by $8,000.
