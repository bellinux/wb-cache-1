This paper deals with stress analysis in <b>coaxial</b> bonded <b>joints.</b> The objective was to analyze the effect of various geometries of the different parts of the assembly in order to optimize the maximal transmitted load of such joints. In the case of tensile loads, the stress distributions were analyzed using axisymmetric theory of elasticity. A pressure-dependent elastic limit of the adhesive was used, in order to accurately represent the difference between tensile-shear and compression-shear loads in the mechanical response of the adhesive. In adhesively bonded joints, stress concentrations can contribute to the initiation and propagation of cracks in the adhesive. Therefore, designing adhesively bonded assemblies which strongly limit stress concentrations can significantly increase the load transmitted by the assembly. Moreover, cylindrical joints are associated with high substrate strength in the radial direction, meaning that peel and cleavage forces have different effects compared to single lap joints. A comparison between the mechanical behavior of these two joints is proposed, starting from 2 D simulations in the case of tensile and compressive loads. Furthermore, the influence of the angle of conical geometries of the bonded area, which can easily be used for such assemblies, is analyzed with respect to the stress distributions. It is shown that several geometries allow a large reduction of stress concentrations and thus lead to stronger assemblies. Moreover the influences of several geometries which strongly limit stress concentrations are presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{main point}} of this {{research}} was работы являлось to create a stand to explore the application of short pulse radio signals in radar. The stand consists of antenna and waveguide elements. Each element out to guarantee operation in X-band with 10 percent working bank and 5 percent instantaneous bandwidth and the power output gotta be 1. 5 kW. The form of the antenna beam patten need to be similar to cosecant pattern Side-lobe level need to be less than - 25 dB. Background level got to be at least - 30 dB. Wave friction, which is radiated from the antenna aperture, got to simultaneous formed in a space. As the most easily realizing variant of such antenna cutting parabolic mirror antenna with offset irradiator was chosen. The irradiator phase centre is shifted from {{the focal point of the}} paraboloid to form a cosecant pattern. Method of physical optics is used for the analysis of antennas. Calculating pattern of horn irradiator and mirror antenna which were met the requirements was received. The construction choice was limited by the preproduction possibilities, mass and dimensions. Mirror antenna consists of skeleton framing with mirroring elements which are fixing on it. Mirroring plane is multiplex and consists off rectangular planes made by hydroforming method. Antenna was tested and adjusted at the antenna darkroom after fabricating. The results were meted requirements. Besides the mirror antenna and the horn antenna waveguide elements, waveguide bends and rotating joints were calculated, manufactured and researched. All calculations included the manufacturers tolerances, technological corner R etc. As the construction base of rotating <b>joint</b> <b>coaxial</b> waveguide was chosen. The decision on the one hand: let keep the axial symmetry of excited wave at rotating part of the waveguide, on the other hand there’s no necessary to apply resonant rings, which are plug into dielectric beads for the transition from rotating ring part to rectangular waveguide. Devices’ parts are interconnected by choke-flange coupling. Chosen construction provides required power level. Researching of all devices shows there’s satisfying to the requirements. Model could be modifying. Horn irradiator could be replaced and plane mirror subdish could be placed at irradiator frame. </p...|$|R
