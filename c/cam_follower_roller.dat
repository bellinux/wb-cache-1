40|$|In {{the first}} part of this {{dissertation}} research, failure modes of similar laser and dissimilar ultrasonic welds in lap-shear specimens under quasi-static loading conditions were investigated. High strength low alloy (HSLA) steel sheets were used to make laser welded lap-shear specimens. Magnesium and HSLA steel sheets were used to make ultrasonic welded lap-shear specimens. Quasi-static tests were conducted on dog-bone shaped lap-shear specimens for both welds. In order to understand the failure mode of the welds, finite element analyses were conducted to identify the effects of the material properties and the weld geometry. The results of the finite element analyses for the laser weld based on multi-zone non-homogeneous material models show that the higher effective stress-plastic strain curves of the weld and heat affected zones and the geometry of the weld protrusion result in the necking/shear failure mode in the load carrying sheet. The results of the finite element analyses for the dissimilar ultrasonic weld based on multi-zone indentation models show that the weld indentation triggers different plastic flow patterns in the load carrying sheet. In the second part of this dissertation research, closed-form analytical solutions to calculate the load distributions by the rolling elements on the raceway for zero-interference and interference conditions in roller bearings were investigated. A special case involving <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> <b>roller</b> bearings was also investigated. The contact solutions by Hertz and Persson provided the analytical background for the proposed solutions. These solutions along with an assumption that the multiple contacts of rolling elements are similar to the contact of a lumped body corresponding to the rolling elements were used to derive the proposed solutions. The proposed closed-form solutions require minimal input parameters and therefore are expected to be widely used in the bearing industry. Finite element analyses were conducted to validate the proposed solutions for selected geometries and loads. Based on the proposed solutions, a complete yet simple procedure to estimate the fatigue lives of roller bearings were introduced for use in the bearing design and selection processes...|$|E

2500|$|Sliding {{friction}} between {{the surface of the}} cam and the <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> which rides upon it can be considerable. In order to reduce wear at this point, the <b>cam</b> and <b>follower</b> are both surface hardened, and modern lubricant motor oils contain additives specifically to reduce sliding friction. The lobes of the camshaft are usually slightly tapered and the faces of the valve lifters slightly domed, causing the lifters to rotate to distribute wear on the parts. The surfaces of the <b>cam</b> and <b>follower</b> are designed to [...] "wear in" [...] together, and therefore each follower should stay with its original cam lobe and never be moved to a different lobe. You can put new lifters on an old cam but never old lifters on a new cam. In some engines the <b>followers</b> have <b>rollers</b> which eliminate the sliding friction and wear but add mass to the valvetrain.|$|R
40|$|To {{solve the}} indetermination of forces {{existing}} in a form-closed cam mechanism formed by conjugate cams, where the {{contact between the}} <b>cams</b> and the <b>follower</b> <b>rollers</b> is constantly ensured by only the geometry of the elements, dynamic models that consider the elasticity of the elements must be proposed. Because the stiffness {{of the main elements}} is associated with the elasticity of the solids, tight variations in manufacturing and assembly errors modify the effective interference fit, which significantly affects the expected fatigue life of the mechanism, leading to a premature failure of the elements due to surface fatigue. Based on a real industrial application of a conjugate cam mechanism and using lumped-parameter models, the objectives of this paper are: first, to show {{that it is difficult to}} achieve a pure form-closed conjugate cam mechanism, with the expected fatigue life of the mechanism, by using only standard tolerance specifications; second, to compare the expected fatigue life and motor torque with other cam mechanism design strategies such as force-closed and the combination of force-closed and form-closed strategies, known as force-closed conjugate cam strategy. This paper based on simulation results demonstrates that this latest strategy can, thanks to a better control of the preload, easily achieve results very similar to the theoretical ones of a form-closed conjugate cam mechanism. A prototype of the mechanism of the force-closed conjugate cam strategy is also built. Postprint (author's final draft...|$|R
50|$|A <b>cam</b> and <b>follower</b> {{is formed}} by the direct contact of two {{specially}} shaped links. The driving link is called the cam (also see cam shaft) and the link that is driven through the direct contact of their surfaces is called the follower. The shape of the contacting surfaces of the <b>cam</b> and <b>follower</b> determines {{the movement of the}} mechanism. In general a <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> mechanism's energy is transferred from <b>cam</b> to <b>follower.</b> The <b>cam</b> shaft is rotated and, according to the <b>cam</b> profile, the <b>follower</b> moves up and down. Now slightly different types of eccentric <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> are also available in which energy is transferred from the <b>follower</b> to the <b>cam.</b> The main benefit of this type of <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> mechanism is that the follower moves a little bit and helps to rotate the cam 6 times more circumference length with 70% force.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Instead of 2 D {{expanding}} diagram method, {{this paper}} presents a new regenerating method for cutter location paths of using smaller tools to produce cylindrical cams. According to the expected motions, cams are put to use in various applications in mechanism. For a cylindrical <b>cam,</b> the <b>roller</b> <b>follower</b> operates in a groove cut {{on the periphery of}} an end mill with the diameter same as the roller. By using the conventional method, full-sized cutting tools, will restrict the flexibility of choosing cutting tools for wide roller guide. The manufacture of cylindrical cams is complicate and precise work that depends on the generating method and types of machine tools employed. Since the guiding curve cannot be offset exactly along the cylindrical surface, this leads to some approximating problems. Though the tool-paths generation by using the same size tools as rollers is applied in practice, the study of NC program by unequal tools is not available to meet high precision requirement. This proposed 3 D offset-based generating method can regenerate tool-paths for standard cutting tools instead of larger ones and implemented on computerized CAM system. Examples with wider grooves are demonstrated to prove its effectiveness...|$|R

A 3 -degree of freedom mathematical model is used to analyze and represent the <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> system. The output tracking error in <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> systems is generally caused by errors in cam profile manufacturing, variation in the speed of the driving motor and the dynamics of the <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> system.

50|$|While <b>roller</b> <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> {{are similar}} to roller {{bearings}}, {{there are quite a}} few differences. Standard ball and roller bearings are designed to be pressed into a rigid housing, which provides circumferential support. This keeps the outer race from deforming, so the race cross-section is relatively thin. In the case of <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> the outer race is loaded at a single point, so the outer race needs a thicker cross-section to reduce deformation. However, in order to facilitate this the roller diameter must be decreased, which also decreases the dynamic bearing capacity.|$|R
