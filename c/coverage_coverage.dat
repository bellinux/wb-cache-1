40|$|Testing is an {{important}} activity for checking the correctness of system implementations. It is performed by applying test experiments to an implementation under test, by making observations during {{the execution of the}} tests, and by subsequently assigning a verdict about the correct functioning of the implementation. The correctness criterion that is to be tested should be given in the System specifications. The specification prescribes what the system has to do and what not, and, consequently, constitutes the basis for any testing activity. This paper describes an approach to formalization of criteria of computer systems software testing. A brief review of control-flow criteria is introduced. As a formal language for describing the criteria, the Z notation is selected.

50|$|Software {{written in}} {{accordance}} with IEC 61508 {{may need to be}} unit tested, depending up on the SIL level it needs to achieve. The main requirement in Unit Testing is to ensure that the software is fully tested at the function level and that all possible branches and paths are taken through the software. In some higher SIL level applications, the software code coverage requirement is much tougher and an MCDC code coverage criterion is used rather than simple branch coverage. To obtain the MCDC (modified condition decision <b>coverage)</b> <b>coverage</b> information, one will need a Unit Testing tool, sometimes referred to as a Software Module Testing tool.|$|E
5000|$|Several challenges, however, {{exist in}} the {{monitoring}} of international labour standards.

[...] Additionally, despite the large amount of data, there are still gaps in their <b>coverage.</b> <b>Coverage</b> is greatest in the urban environments and the formal sector. Conversely, gaps {{exist in the}} coverage of rural environments and informal sectors which can positively skew the labour statistics that countries report.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} the coverage problem {{from the perspective}} of target localization for wireless camera sensor networks. We first propose a novel localization-oriented sensing model based on the perspective projection of camera sensors. Based on the sensing model, we propose a new notion of coverage, Localization-oriented coverage (L-coverage for short), by using Bayesian estimation theory. Furthermore, we analyze the relationship between the density of camera sensors and the L-coverage probability under random deployment where camera sensors are deployed according to a 2 -dimensional Poisson process. According to the relationship between the density of camera sensors and the L-coverage probability, we derive the density requirements for an expected L-coverage probability. We validate and evaluate our proposed models and schemes by simulations.

We analyzed cross-sectional data collected from a randomly selected sample of 12, 191 women who had delivered a child in the last one year from the date of data collection in Haryana state. Five indicators were calculated to evaluate coverage and financial risk protection for institutional delivery [...] proportion of public sector deliveries, out-of-pocket expenditure, percentage of women who incurred no expenses, prevalence of catastrophic expenditure for institutional delivery and incidence of impoverishment due to out-of-pocket expenditure for delivery. These indicators were calculated for {{the public and private sectors}} for 5 wealth quintiles and 21 districts of the state. The coverage of institutional delivery in Haryana state was 82 %, of which 65 % took place in public sector facilities. Approximately 63 % of the women reported no expenditure on delivery in the public sector. The mean out-of-pocket expenditures for delivery in the public and private sectors in Haryana were INR 771 (USD 14. 2) and INR 12, 479 (USD 229), respectively, which were catastrophic for 1. 6 % and 22 % of households, respectively. Our findings suggest that there is considerably high coverage of institutional delivery care in Haryana state, with significant financial risk protection in the public sector. However, coverage and financial risk protection for institutional delivery vary substantially across districts and among different socio-economic groups and must be strengthened. The success of the public sector in providing high coverage and financial risk protection in maternal health provides encouragement for the role that the public sector can play in universalizing health care...|$|E

The array contains 674, 517 SNPs, and provides excellent genome-wide as well as gene-based and candidate-SNP <b>coverage.</b> <b>Coverage</b> was calculated using an approach based on imputation and cross validation. Preliminary results for the first 80, 301 saliva-derived DNA samples from the RPGEH demonstrate very high quality genotypes, with sample success rates above 94 % and over 98 % of successful samples having SNP call rates exceeding 98 %. At steady state, we have produced 462 million genotypes per week for each Axiom system.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the consequences of}} news coverage following a chemical disaster on the subsequent drop in stock returns of the firm responsible for the accident. To do this, we build an original dataset of chemical explosions that occurred worldwide from 1990 - 2005. Because investors and journalists react to the same information, {{to account for the}} simultaneity bias we use original instrumental variables, namely a measure of the firm’s newsworthiness, and a measure of daily news pressure at the time of disasters. Everything else equals (pollution, fatalities and firm’s characteristics), there is clear evidence that ex-tensive news coverage mitigates the market value losses on the short-term, while after a few months, marginally more intense news coverage is costly to firms. This gradual and delayed reaction {{may be due to the}} fact that investors are slow to recognize the extent of the loss associated with public concern raised by intense news <b>coverage</b> <b>coverage</b> and pollution...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The power {{consumption}} of nodes determines {{the lifetime of}} the wireless sensor network. Thus, the design of low-power node is very important. The sensors sense physical phenomena in different ways, designing and testing a different coverage protocol for each sensing model is indeed a costly task. To address these challenging tasks a new Probabilistic Coverage Protocol (denoted by PCP) that could employ different sensing models is proposed. PCP works with the common disk sensing model with minimal changes. Simulation exhibits that PCP is robust and it can function correctly in presence of node failures and demonstrates the comparison of PCP with other protocols and show that PCP out performs them in several aspects, including number of activated sensors, total energy consumed, and network lifetime. The analysis and design of our coverage protocol can be extended to the probabilistic K-coverage. K-coverage is needed in several sensor network applications to enhance reliability and accuracy of the network.

40|$|Wireless ad-hoc sensor {{networks}} have recently {{emerged as a}} premier research topic. They have great long term economic potential, ability to transform our lives, and pose many new system building challenges. Sensor networks also pose {{a number of new}} conceptual and optimization problems. Some, such as location, deployment, and tracking, are fundamental issues, in that many applications rely on them for needed information. In this paper, we address one of the fundamental problems, namely <b>coverage.</b> <b>Coverage</b> in general, answers the questions about quality of service (surveillance) that can be provided by a particular sensor network. We first define the coverage problem from several points of view including deterministic, statistical, worst and best case, and present examples in each domain. By combining computational geometry and graph theoretic techniques, specifically the Voronoi diagram and graph search algorithms, we establish the main highlight of the paper - optimal polynomial time worst and average case algorithm for coverage calculation. We also present comprehensive experimental results and discuss future research directions related to coverage in sensor networks. I...|$|E
