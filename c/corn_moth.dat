5000|$|This small moth has a {{wingspan}} of 10-18 mm. The forewings are irregularly mottled black, {{white and}} grey, resembling congeners {{such as the}} European <b>corn</b> <b>moth</b> (N. granella). The head has a tuft of pale yellow hairs. The caterpillars feed mainly on bracket fungi. Their food spectrum has been subject to considerable dispute in the past due to confusion with the European <b>corn</b> <b>moth.</b> Some claimed that N. cloacella caterpillars eat {{a wide range of}} food [...] - [...] dried fruit and mushrooms, seeds and other vegetable material, e.g. cereal grains, Capsicum annuum fruit, poppyseed (Papaver somniferum), bitter almonds (Prunus amygdalus amara) or bilberries (Vaccinium), but even cork (hence its common name) and beeswax. Other authors stated that they were only found on the oak mazegill fungus (Daedalea quercina), and ascribed the wide range of foodstuffs to N. granella. But as it seems, neither extreme was correct; the caterpillars do eat preferentially fungi [...] - [...] not only the oak mazegill but also others (e.g. birch polypore, Piptoporus betulinus) [...] - , feeding on plant debris and similar materials when their favorite food is not available.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of sensitization to insect aeroallergens in allergic rhinitis patients in Yazd as a desert city in Iran. A cross-sectional study was undertaken on 95 allergic rhinitis patients who were referred to allergy clinic of Yazd city. Skin prick tests (SPT) by standard extracts of three insect aeroallergens including Mosquito, <b>Corn</b> <b>moth,</b> Cockroach and two species of mites as common aeroallergens in allergic rhinitis (Dermatophagoid Farina, Dermatophagoid Peteronysinus) were done. SPT results showed that the most common insect aeroallergens were: mosquito (32. 6 %) followed by <b>corn</b> <b>moth</b> (26. 3 %) and cockroach (13. 7 %). The prevalence of SPT positive response to Dermatophagoid Peteronysinus, Dermatophagoid Farina were 8. 4 % and 7. 4 %, respectively. These results demonstrated that sensitization to insect aeroallergens was significantly more common compared to mites in patients with allergic rhinitis in Yazd city, a city surrounded by deserts. High prevalence of skin reactivity to mosquito and <b>corn</b> <b>moth</b> as insect aeroallergens in Yazd city with hot and dry climate in contrast to humid regions such as north of Iran, where mites are more frequent, indicates differences in the prevalence of aeroallergen reactivity in various areas with different climates.

The first objectives of these studies were to determine if more larvae were produced in popcorn than in field corn and to determine how popcorn influenced female oviposition and larval distribution within neighboring field corn. Two varieties of popcorn (M 140, 105 d and M 3374 Y, 118 d), one mixture of popcorn (50 % 105 d and 50 % 118 d), and field corn (DK 580, 108 d) were evaluated. Significantly higher densities of O. nubilalis larvae were found in popcorn than field <b>corn.</b> <b>Moth</b> oviposition and larval distribution were evaluated using 105 d popcorn embedded in several cornfields across Iowa. Significantly more egg masses and larvae {{were found in the}} popcorn compared with field corn. One or two rows of field corn adjacent to popcorn tended to have higher numbers of egg masses and larvae compared with background field corn. Number of eggs per egg mass was significantly higher in popcorn than field corn. These data suggests more O. nubilalis are produced in popcorn than field corn. Popcorn has no effect on O. nubilalis egg mass and larval distribution after 1. 5 m. The second objective was to determine if popcorn can influence corn rootworm distribution. Two varieties of popcorn (105 -d and 118 -d), one mixture of popcorn (50 %: 105 -d and 118 -d), and field corn (108 -d) were evaluated. Significantly higher numbers of western and northern corn rootworm adults were captured from popcorn plots in 2000 and 2002. Adult corn rootworm captures were not significantly different from popcorn and field-corn plots during 2001. The third and fourth objectives were to determine if total corn rootworm beetle emergence and the rate of beetle emergence were similar from 20 plots of popcorn and field corn with various treatment combinations. Emergence rates and total beetle emergence from popcorn plots tended to be lower than from field-corn plots. These data suggests popcorn influences adult corn rootworm distribution, however, compared to field corn, popcorn produces fewer beetles...|$|E

50|$|This insect is a generalist {{predator}} {{with a broad}} host range, reportedly attacking 90 insect species, {{which includes}} several important economic pests. Reported prey include the larvae of Mexican bean beetle, European <b>corn</b> borer, diamondback <b>moth,</b> <b>corn</b> earworm, beet armyworm, fall armyworm, cabbage looper, imported cabbageworm, Colorado potato beetle, velvetbean caterpillar, and flea beetles. When prey are scarce, the spined soldier bug may feed on plant juices, but this feeding is not reported to cause plant damage. Podisus maculiventris is associated with several crops including alfalfa, apples, asparagus, beans, celery, cotton, crucifers, cucurbits, eggplant, potatoes, onions, soybeans, sweet corn and tomatoes. The effectiveness of this species in preying on economic pests resulted in its use in classical biological control programs in other countries, including Eastern Europe and Russia. However, {{this has not been}} successful in colder climates, perhaps due to an inability of overwinter. Podisus maculiventris eggs are also sold commercially for use in control programs and this has proven successful in controlling pests in European and North American heated greenhouses. Use in large area field crops is often not economically viable due to the production costs of raising the bug. In addition, naturally occurring populations often are not numerous enough to overpower large populations of pests in the spring. Pheromones have been used to draw naturally occurring and newly emerging populations of this stink bug to target crops in the spring.|$|R

40|$|Speciation {{involves}} {{the origin of}} trait differences that limit or prevent gene exchange and ultimately results in daughter populations that form monophyletic or exclusive genetic groups. However, for recently diverged populations or species, between which reproductive isolation is often incomplete, gene genealogies will be discordant and most regions of the genome will display nonexclusive genealogical patterns. In these situations, genome regions for which one or both species are exclusive groups may mark the footprint of recent selective sweeps. Alternatively, such regions may include or be closely linked to “speciation genes, ” genes involved in reproductive isolation. Therefore, comparisons of gene genealogies allow inferences about the genetic architectures of both reproductive isolation and adaptation. Contrasting genealogical relationships in sexually isolated Z and E pheromone strains of the European <b>corn</b> borer <b>moth</b> (ECB) demonstrate the relevance of this approach.

An isolated pheromone gland bioassay showed that synthetic PBAN was active at 0. 02 pmol, with maximal activity occurring at 0. 5 pmol and 60 min of incubation. Second-messenger studies demonstrated that extracellular Ca 2 + is necessary for PBAN activity on isolated pheromone glands.

Adults in the central and eastern Corn Belt aggregate in grassy areas around and within the cornfield where they spend the daylight hours resting and where mating activity occurs at night. Mated females leave the aggregation sites at night to oviposit in cornfields, thus using the grass as a staging area.

40|$|Pheromone {{orientation}} in moths is an exemplar of olfactory acuity. To avoid heterospecific mating, males respond to femaleproduced blends with high specificity and temporal resolution. A finely tuned sensory to projection neuron network secures specificity, and this network {{is thought to}} assess pheromone quality continually during orientation. We tested whether male moths do indeed evaluate each pheromone encounter and surprisingly found that male European <b>corn</b> borer <b>moths</b> instead generalize across successive encounters. Although initially highly ratio specific, once “locked on” to the pheromone plume the acceptable ratio can vary widely, and even unattractive blends can become attractive. We further found that this “mental shortcut” may be {{a consequence of the}} fact that sensory neurons exposed to frequent encounters do not reliably encode blend ratios. Neurons tuned to either of the two pheromone components adapt differentially in plumes containing the preferred blend ratio (97 : 3) and cause the olfactory sensory signal to “evolve,” even in narrowly tuned pheromonal circuits. However, apparently the brain interprets these shifting signals as invariant “gestalts. ” Generalization in pheromone perception may mitigate stabilizing selection and allow introgression between sympatric strains, such as in the European corn borer, that otherwise appear isolated by pheromonal differences. Generalization may also be important in responses to general odorants, as circuits underlying these display vast sensitivity differences, complex interactions, and temporal intricacies...|$|R

Two races, one univoltine and one bivoltine, produce and respond to a 3 : 97 E/Z blend of ∆ 11 - 14 :OAc's. The races {{are referred to as}} BE, UZ, and BZ to denote these differences.

Gene flow among the races was investigated using differences in triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) allozyme frequencies of moths from sites sampled across the state. The fixed nature of the Tpi- 1 allele in the BE race and increases in the Tpi- 1 allele frequencies in UZ populations in sympatry with the BE race support the hypothesis that gene flow following hybridization is unidirectional from BE populations into the Z populations.

Pheromone trapping was initiated in NY and PA in 2010 and in VT in 2011 in collaboration with scientists from Penn State University and University of Vermont. The trap network has revealed western bean cutworms are becoming more widely distributed and populations are increasing, posing a potential risk to dry beans and the over 3. 5 million acres of corn grown in NY, PA, and VT. Thus far, only non-economic larval infestations {{have been found in}} the Northeast. However, this season there are reports of some WBC damage to untreated fresh market sweet corn in northern NY and trace amounts of suspected WBC damage to dry beans in western NY...|$|R
40|$|Oviposition {{preference}} by European corn borers, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), for {{or against}} transgenic corn would influence amounts of refuge required for resistance management. The objective {{of this research was}} to determine if various Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) corn transgenic events influence 0. nubilalis oviposition. All commercially available events (currently 5) were evaluated, plus 1 experimental event. Results from 3 independent studies are reported, including 3 field-cage experiments with vegetative corn, 2 field-cage experiments with reproductive corn, and 2 field experiments with natural 0. nubilalis on reproductive corn. In each case, Bt corn hybrids are compared with their near isogenic hybrids by counting numbers of egg masses on each plant type. More extensive comparisons were made in 3 of the experiments by determining the number, size, and location of egg masses on the <b>corn</b> hybrids. <b>Moths</b> laid more egg masses on Bt corn than on non-Bt corn in 1 cage experiment. These results, however, were not found in any of the other experiments. There is evidence that suggests cage effects influence moth oviposition more than Bt protein. Four of the 5 cage experiments and 2 field experiments indicate that the tested Bt events do not influence 0. nubilalis oviposition. Larval injury to isogenic corn during the vegetative stage did not influence adult oviposition during the corn reproductive stage when compared with Bt corn and noninjured isogenic corn. Based on these experiments, suggestions are made for future studies that use natural 0. nubilalis rather than 0. nubilalis in cages...|$|R
40|$|Female moths {{often become}} {{depleted}} of sex pheromone after mating as the various components of virgin behavior are switched off. In examining a potential male contribution to these {{events in the}} <b>corn</b> earworm <b>moth</b> Helicoverpa zea, we have characterized a basic polypeptide from the tissues producing (accessory glands) and storing (duplex) the seminal fluids. The peptide evokes the depletion of sex pheromone when injected into virgin females. This pheromonostatic peptide (PSP) is 57 amino acids long and contains a single disulfide bridge. It is blocked at the N terminus with pyroglutamate and at the C terminus by amidation. As little as 23 ng of peptide evokes the near-complete depletion of pheromone in decapitated (neck-ligated) females that had been injected with pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide. Activity is approximately 15 -fold less in intact virgins, showing that the head limits the expression of activity in these injected females. Females mated to surgically impaired males, capable of producing a spermatophore but not transferring spermatozoa or seminal fluids, are depleted of pheromone by injected peptide. Females whose abdominal nerve cords have been severed are not depleted of pheromone after mating. Thus, neural signals either descending or ascending via the nerve cord are required for the depletion of pheromone after mating. PSP, from the seminal fluids, may participate in this process by direct or indirect action on the glandular tissue; if so, it represents an unusual mechanism in insects for the regulation by seminal fluids of postmating reproductive behavior...|$|R
