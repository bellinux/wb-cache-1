5|$|A major {{turning point}} for the {{movement}} <b>came</b> <b>during</b> World War I, when many U.S. servicemen were diagnosed with venereal diseases. The government's response included an anti-venereal disease campaign that framed sexual intercourse and contraception as issues {{of public health and}} legitimate topics of scientific research. This was the first time a U.S. government institution had engaged in a sustained, public discussion of sexual matters; as a consequence, contraception transformed from an issue of morals to an issue of public health.|$|E

Construction of Davison <b>came</b> <b>during</b> a period of rapid dorm-building spanning 1893–1902 during which the older seminary-style model of housing—a single large hall in which all a college's residents lived, in Vassar's case Main Building—was quickly waning in popularity in favor of smaller individual houses. The project began with the opening of Strong House in 1893 and continued with Raymond House in 1897, Lathrop House in 1901, and finally Davison in 1902.|$|E

5|$|Muhammad Ilyas, {{the founder}} of Tablighi Jamaat, {{wanted to create a}} {{movement}} that would enjoin good and forbid evil as the Qur'an decreed, as his teacher Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi dreamed of doing. The inspiration for this <b>came</b> <b>during</b> his second pilgrimage to Mecca in 1926. What he lacked in scholarly learning, presence, charisma or speaking ability, he made up for in zeal. He initially tried to establish a network of mosque-based religious schools to educate the Mewati Muslims about Islamic beliefs and practices. Shortly afterwards, he was disappointed with the reality that these institutions were producing religious functionaries, but not preachers.|$|E
