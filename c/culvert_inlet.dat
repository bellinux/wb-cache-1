40|$|Specification of {{appropriate}} culvert design criteria for fish passage {{has been a}} source of considerable, long-standing controversy within the State of Alaska. In an effort to resolve this issue, the Alaska Departments of Fish and Game and Transportation and Public Facilities chose the Poplar Grove Creek culvert crossing of the Richardson Highway located near Glennallen, Alaska, as a study site for a Joint interagency fish passage study. During May 1986, the migration of Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) through the Poplar Grove Creek culvert was studied. The highway culvert Is 33. 5 m (110 ft) long and 1. 5 m (5 ft) In diameter. Under some flow conditions,the culvert 2 ̆ 7 s water velocities (particularly at the <b>culvert</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet) have exceeded that reported as the sustained swimming speed of Arctic grayling. The purpose of the study was to document the conditions that permitted or prevented Arctic grayling passage through the culvert and to recommend guidelines for fish passage through this and other culverts. Successful fish passage through the culvert ranged from 12...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of a culvert within a river channel alters the local hydraulic characteristics which often increases upstream water elevation {{as a result of}} the volume of water being constricted as it enters the culvert. This effect can be exacerbated if there is a build up of debris either at the inlet or trapped within the culvert. As a consequence culverts, especially those which are prone to becoming blocked, may considerably increase the potential for out of channel flows and therefore the risk of serious flooding. While trash screens may be fitted at a <b>culvert</b> <b>inlet</b> to prevent debris from entering, unless they are well designed and maintained they may increase the potential for flooding if they become blocked by trapping debris that would have passed unrestricted through the culvert. Guidelines for screen design focus mainly on ensuring sufficient screen area is provided to handle the expected debris load, while recommendations for individual screen elements, such as bar spacing, are generally based on anecdotal evidence and site specific environmental or safety concerns. However, many different trash screen configurations can influence blockage potential. To gain a better understanding of how blockage, and therefore any potential associated flood risk, of culvert trash screens is influenced by screen geometry and position, a Froude-scaled physical model was developed to facilitate assessment of the efficiency of different trash screen configurations. To minimize scaling issues related to complex geometry, and to ensure the focus of the research remained on the influence of screen design rather than on factors specific to the debris, wooden dowel was used to represent different debris lengths. Detailed analysis based on 147, 000 debris passes is used to show that, as would be expected, potential for screen blockage by debris increases as the ratio of debris length to bar spacing increases. However, in addition, a key finding has been that the screen position relative to the zone of flow acceleration created as the flow is constricted on approach to the <b>culvert</b> <b>inlet</b> is a significant driving factor in the blocking potential of the screen. Detailed statistical analysis was used to define blockage potential in terms of all contributing factors. The derived model was used to develop end user focussed tools, a nomograph and an interactive spreadsheet, to aid estimation of blockage at a screen for a given geometry and position...|$|E
40|$|Fish {{passage through}} {{culverts}} {{is an important}} consideration in fish bearing streams. Just as adequate culvert capacity is required for safety, adequate provision for fish passage is required to maintain healthy fish populations. The main problem with improperly designed and installed culverts is that they form velocity barriers to fish migrants at the outlet, inlet or through the culvert barrel. If water depths are too low or water velocities at any of these three culvert locations exceed fish swimming ability, fish may be prevented from reaching their spawning grounds. Since hydraulic efficiency and optimum fish passage requirements are mutually exclusive objectives, compromises must be effected that permit adequate fish protection with maximum economy. Such compromises involve the matching of water velocities with fish swimming performance at design discharges that allow limited delay in fish migrations. Migrating fish must negotiate the culvert outlet, the culvert barrel, and the <b>culvert</b> <b>inlet</b> before successfully passing upstream. Hydraulic conditions, such as water velocities and depths, at {{each one of these}} three locations must be suitable for passage at the highest and lowest stream flows expected during fish migration. Fish need to swim continuously for the entire culvert length when no resting opportunities are available. Culvert length and velocities, as well as maximum distance that fish are able to swim, determine whether fish can pass through a culvert once they enter it...|$|E
40|$|Under the Fisheries Act, highway {{construction}} projects {{that result in}} harmful disruption or destruction of fish habitat require replacement habitat. At Yukon Highways & Public Works we have developed successful compensation projects together with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, {{and in many cases}} with the help of consultants. This paper describes three Yukon examples. The first project describes the re-establishment of fish passage through two large culverts that were elevated. This was done back by backwatering the <b>culvert</b> <b>inlets,</b> constructing a riffle, and by installing baffles in one of the culverts. For the second project we will be creating over-wintering habitat for grayling in a small fresh water stream by excavating small side channels. The last project describes how we will be connecting two old gravel pit lakes with a large glacially fed river system. This will provide year-round fish habitat and a refuge for fish in summer to escape from turbid river water. ...|$|R
40|$|Potentially important, miscellaneous, {{qualitative}} {{observations of}} four field studies of spawning migrations of arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) through highway culverts are discussed. Problems associated with <b>culvert</b> outlets, <b>inlets,</b> and barrels are described together with observed methods that fish use to negotiate culverts. The importance of location where fish actually swim in culverts is discussed. Limited observations of effects of culvert skew on culvert fish barrel flow patterns indicate such skew can make fish passage less difficult. The necessity of recognizing red muscle and white muscle {{power and energy}} capabilities of fish attempting to pass through culverts is indicated. Observations of fish attempting to to enter a small fish ladder and a difficult culvert indicate that water-produced noise may attract fish to relatively small passage devices.

Crossings on Route 73 were combined into four intersections controlled by traffic signals. New sidewalks and curbs were also included, as were bike lanes. New basins, box <b>culverts,</b> pipes and <b>inlets</b> were added to improve holding capacity in storms and mitigate flooding at the intersection.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} a <b>culvert</b> <b>inlet</b> has a {{significant}} bearing upon {{the relationship of the}} head to the discharge of a culvert. Its relative importance hinges upon the type of flow occurring in the culvert, which in turn is governed by the location of the control section. For part-full flow the control may be either at the inlet or the outlet depending on whether the slope is hydraulically steep or mild. In the case of short culverts, control may be at the inlet even for horizontal or mild slopes. For full flow, barrel friction provides the control. The head-discharge curves of culverts having square-edge inlets have been compared with those for culverts having rounded inlets to illustrate the conditions for which a head-advantage may be obtained by using a rounded inlet. These comparisons have been made for three categories of culvert flow: long culverts on steep slopes, long culverts on mild slopes, and short culverts. Dimensionless head-discharge curves have been plotted for culvert flow in each category. For culverts on steep slopes, experimental data have been compared with the computed values and, since the agreement was reasonably good, serve as a basis for the analysis of flow in culverts operating under conditions other than those for which the tests were made. The greatest head-advantage for a particular discharge of the rounded inlet over that of a square-edge inlet was found for those cases in which the control section was located at the inlet. These were long culverts on steep slopes or short culverts where the length was negligible. for long culverts on mild slopes, the head-advantage was far less pronounced...|$|E
40|$|EA Engineering, Science, and Technology (EA) and Connecticut Fund for the Environment (CFE), in {{consultation}} with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, have designed and are permitting modifications of a <b>culvert</b> <b>inlet</b> transition on the Pequonnock River to incorporate a pool and weir fish way. During low-flow periods, water depths down the existing concrete transition, which is near the intersection of Chopsey Hill Road and Glenwood Avenue in Bridgeport, Connecticut, are too shallow to allow upstream fish passage for target species (American shad, blueback herring, and alewife). The pool and weir sections were designed to improve fish passage during the upstream migration season (1 April 31 July) over a 5 - 178 cfs with a maximum velocity of 5 ft/sec and minimum water depth of 8 in. EA designed a multi-tiered weir able to provide different depths at different flow regimes and designed the pools using the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s (USFWS) Energy Dissipation Factor(EDF) formula. The weirs were designed to provide an 8 -in. minimum depth through a low-flow notch at the minimum design flow (5 cfs) and the majority of the normal design flow (45 cfs) over the remaining weir. Depths in the low-flow notch were 14 in. at normal design flow (45 cfs) and 22 in. at maximum design flow (178 cfs). Velocities in the pools and weirs were less than 5 ft/s for all design flows. Water depths in the concrete transition adjacent to the pool and weir channel ranged from 1 in. at normal design flow up to 6 in. at maximum design flow. For the range of design flow, the EDF for the pools was less than 4. 0 ft-lbs/sec per ft 3 of pool volume, less than the USWFS standard of 4. 0 ftlbs/ sec per ft 3 maximum...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Culverts are {{important}} hydraulic structures whose main {{purpose is to}} safely convey water through infrastructures crossing streams (e. g. roads). Several design guidelines exist for clear water conditions, {{but none of them}} takes into account the sediments. Therefore, in the framework of the Natural hazards Infrastructure for floods and landslide (NIFS) project, five student-theses have been prepared in order to bridge this knowledge gap, and contribute to development of new guidelines for culvert design. The theses were based on model tests (1 : 10) which were designed to specifically study the effect of sediment transport. The culvert s hydraulic capacity was investigated with different boundary conditions, under both clear water condition and sediment load. The present study is the first joint analysis of all the data from these studies, which identifies the favourable <b>culvert</b> <b>inlet</b> design, under sediment transport. The experiments were carried out with three different inlet types (cut, projecting, wingwalls) under inlet control focusing on the effects of the expansion section geometry, the installation of reserve barrel, sediment countermeasures, feeding method, sediment size and sediment amount. The main findings of the thesis were the followings: under jet dominated flow, the wingwall-inlet provided the highest capacity while in case of milder slope (1 : 9) and installed energy dissipation, the projecting inlet. The energy dissipator blocks have been installed for generation of a hydraulic jump. Both width and length of the expansion section influenced the culvert s hydraulic capacity. The culvert showed generally the highest performance for the shortest expansion section length (315 mm; model scale), and for the widest expansion section width (876 mm; model scale). Sediment experiments showed that sediment load generally decreased the culvert s hydraulic capacity as the deposited sediment obstructed the flow through the barrel. From the two sediment feeding methods (gradually, all at once) the all at once feeding resulted in higher headwater levels as more sediment deposited in the basin. Although sediment size and amount had only a slight effect on the culvert performance, the water level was generally higher when more sediment (7 kg) was fed to the model. The installation of a reserve barrel, located at a higher level compared to the main culvert, increased the safety of the structure as it was less prone to be blocked by sediments. Experiments with sediment countermeasures showed that both trash racks and debris deflectors are efficient in sediment retention. However, installation of these structures decreased the culvert s hydraulic capacity. Based on these results, an analysis was carried out focusing on hydraulic capacity, embankment safety and costs to find the optimal configuration. The identified configuration is presented and corresponding sketches have been developed...|$|E

5000|$|In traffic engineering, highway {{guardrail}} {{may prevent}} an errant vehicle from hitting roadside obstacles {{which may be}} either man-made (sign structures, <b>culvert</b> <b>inlets,</b> utility poles) or natural (trees, rock croppings), running {{off the road and}} going down a steep embankment, or veering off the roadway into oncoming traffic (commonly referred to as a median barrier). Roadside obstacles are typically referred to as fixed objects. A secondary objective is keeping the vehicle upright while deflected along the guardrail. The most common type of guardrail in use today is the Blocked-Out W-beam (Strong Post). [...] Strong-post W-beam guardrail consists of wood posts and wood blockouts or steel posts with wood or plastic blockouts. The wood or plastic blockouts reduce or minimize a vehicle snagging on the posts upon impact. In addition, a blockout may be used to increase the offset of guardrail with an obstacle such as a curb.The posts' primary purpose is to maintain the height of the guardrail during the initial stages of post deflection. [...] Maintaining guardrail height also reduces the potential for a vehicle to vault over the guardrail upon initial impact. The posts also {{play a role in the}} amount of resistance and deflection a guardrail may experience during impact. Resistance in a strong post system results from a combination of tensile and flexural stiffness of the rail and the bending and shearing resistance of the posts. [...] One of the main concerns with strong-post W-beam guardrail has been the ability of the system to contain and redirect modern vehicles that have a higher center of gravity along with the increased weight of those vehicles. The problem with this is that a guardrail of the optimum height for a car might not keep a truck from toppling over it, while a motorbike might slip under a higher rail. To address these concerns, significant research and development of a system that could contain and redirect vehicles of varying weights and heights was developed and crash tested (both controlled and simulated). As a result, the Midwest Guardrail System (MGS) was developed and successfully crash tested per NCHRP Report 350 TL-3 criteria. [...] MGS has a higher mounting height, uses larger posts and blockouts as compared to the strong-post W-beam guardrail. One other significant difference is that MGS rail splices occur at mid-span compared to at the posts like the strong-post w-beam guardrail.|$|R
40|$|Numerous Hydraulic {{tests have}} been {{conducted}} over the last Century to solve particular problems or develop general relationships. CFD offers {{a unique opportunity to}} combine and adapt this information into new revised configurations. Physical model results of individual culvert sections or configurations can be used to validate the CFD results of similar configurations.

The Bureau of Public Roads through the University of Iowa conducted numerous tests on <b>culverts,</b> and <b>inlet</b> and outlet geometries. Some of these results were summarized and published in a book called “The Flow of Water Through Culverts” in 1926. The data they presented regarding outlet diffusers effect on increasing culvert capacity provides an excellent test case. Utilizing this data to compare Performance Curves, Hydraulic and Energy Grade Lines, is an effective way to validate the CFD model. Other new insights can be gained from the CFD images and available CFD model data.

By comparing physical hydraulic test data with the CFD model data the advantages of each method can be utilized to produce a model that is both adaptable and available for particular design problems...|$|R
40|$|Corrugated {{steel pipe}} (CSP) {{culverts}} {{are widely used}} as an economical alternative for conveying streams and small rivers through road embankments. While passage of the design flow is generally the primary goal for culvert design, consideration must also be given to maintaining connectivity within the aquatic environment for fish and other aquatic organisms. In Canada, the design criteria for fish passage through culverts are generally specified {{in terms of a}} maximum mean flow velocity corresponding to the weakest swimming fish expected to be found at a specific location. Studies have shown, however, that the velocity distribution within a CSP culvert may provide sufficient areas of lower velocity flow near the culvert boundary to allow for fish passage, even when the mean flow velocity may exceed a fish’s swimming ability. Improved knowledge of the hydraulic conditions within CSP culverts, combined with research into fish swimming capabilities and preferences, may make it possible to better tailor culvert designs for fish passage {{while at the same time}} decreasing construction costs. To meet the requirements of regulators, various measures may be taken to reduce culvert flow velocities. Embedding, or setting the invert of a culvert below the normal stream bed elevation, is a simple and inexpensive method of increasing the flow area in a culvert flowing partially full, thereby decreasing flow velocity. Fish traversing through an embedded culvert benefit not only in terms of lower mean flow velocities, but also even lower flow velocities in the near boundary region. In the province of Saskatchewan culvert embedment is regularly used as a means to improve fish passage conditions. In this study, a laboratory scale model was used to study the velocity distribution within a non-embedded and embedded CSP culvert. An acoustic Doppler velocimeter was used to measure point velocities throughout the flow cross section at several longitudinal locations along the culvert. The hydraulic conditions were varied by changing the discharge, culvert slope and depth of embedment. The point velocity data were analyzed to determine patterns of velocity and turbulence intensity at each cross section, as well as along the length of the culvert. The results from the embedded culvert tests were compared with the results from the equivalent non-embedded tests, so that initial conclusions could be made regarding the use of embedment to improve conditions for fish passage. Analysis of the cross section velocity distributions showed that, even the non-embedded culvert had a significant portion of the flow area with flow velocity less than the mean velocity. The results from the embedded tests confirmed that embedding the culvert reduced the flow velocity throughout each cross section, although the effect was most significant for the cross sections located greater than one culvert diameter downstream from the inlet. This variation in effectiveness of embedment at reducing flow velocities is attributed to the length of the M 1 backwater profile relative to the culvert length, and thus the differential increase in flow depth that occurred at each measurement location along the culvert. For both the non-embedded and embedded culvert the peak point magnitudes of turbulence intensity were found to be located near the <b>culvert</b> <b>inlet</b> where the flow was contracting. In terms of the cross section average turbulence intensity, in the non-embedded culvert turbulence increased with distance downstream from the inlet and was highest at the cross sections located near the culvert outlet. Embedding the culvert was found to either have no impact, or to slightly increase, the cross section average turbulence intensity near the inlet. Again, a result that is attributed to the tapering out of the M 1 backwater profile at locations near the inlet under the flow conditions tested. However, beyond eight culvert diameters downstream from the inlet, embedment did result in lower cross section average turbulence intensity when compared to the non-embedded culvert. The measured velocity profiles for the non-embedded tests were found to compare well to the theoretical log-law velocity distribution using a ks value of between 0. 012 m and 0. 022 m, or approximately one to two times the corrugation amplitude, when the datum for analysis was considered to be located at the crest of the pipe corrugation. The cross section velocity distributions for the non-embedded tests compared very well to the model proposed by Ead et al. (2000). Based on this assessment, it appears that the Ead et al. model is potentially suitable for use in predicting the amount of the cross sectional area in a non-embedded culvert with flow velocity less than the design target for culvert fish passage design purposes. Overall, the results of the study confirm that, embedding a CSP culvert may be an effective way to improve fish passage conditions in terms of both flow velocity and turbulence intensity...|$|E

In most cases the discharge reduction resulting from detention storage is minor and can be neglected in design. However, in some cases the storage effect is substantial, and accounting for it may result in a more economical design. This report presents new methods for quickly estimating the effects of detention storage on the performance of existing culverts and the sizing of new culverts. These methods, which do not require hydrograph routing, are applicable to pipe and box <b>culverts</b> operating under <b>inlet</b> control with no overtopping of the roadway.

The verification of the effectiveness of theoretical equations and its coefficients is vital for adequate prediction of the effect on areas surrounding a culvert structure. There are numerous theoretical culvert equations that reflect culvert hydraulics. This research report will focus on the verification of three theoretical culvert equations used in the industry, as well as a study of application of two hydraulic programs. The culvert system can function under two hydraulic controls. This study is focused on the <b>culvert</b> system under <b>inlet</b> control and covers analysis of rectangular and square portal frame culverts. The study will involve building a physical model and obtaining/gathering data for theoretical, physical, and software model comparison of culvert hydraulics. The results of the study produce a number of discharge rating curves/performance curves for the culvert system; to aid in verification process. The study will give the ability to comment on the level of performance of the theoretical equations and of the software application in comparison to the physical relationship of head water level and flow rate of culvert structures.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the abundance of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) on inter-tidal sandbanks, mother-pup interactions {{as well as the}} impact of anthropogenic disturbance during breeding season. The abundance was a composite picture of harbour seals of different age and sex, and increased gradually towards peaks in June. Although the sandbank water inlet was the longest time emerged, mother-pup pairs and other seals hauled out more abundant on the other sandbanks, probably due to space availability, differences in sandbank structure and distance to human activity. Mothers and their offspring were found to be mostly inactive during haul out. Mothers initiated significantly more frequently interactions i. e. hauling out, entering water and suckling. Seals hauled out at sandbanks close to the dyke were most frequently disturbed by pedestrians. Important regarding the impact on the seals seemed to be the group size of pedestrians and the distance to the seals (on dyke or seaside of it), i. e. pedestrians seaside disturbed more seals. This applies also to the disturbance by marine activity, e. g. distance of seals to the engine boat. Jet fighters were shown to affect the highest mean number of seals per event. After anthropogenic disturbances separations of mother and offspring were not recorded, e. g. due to seals being in the water; however, the steep edges as result of the <b>culvert</b> at water <b>inlet</b> lead to a few separations. The most frequent behavioural response towards anthropogenic disturbance was commotion with a probably lower level of energy costs during the energy consuming lactation period...|$|R

Forty homes north of Winnipeg were evacuated, while dozens of homes were flooded due to ice jams. On Thursday, March 26, some 95 elderly and special needs people were evacuated from the Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation. [...] An engineering firm detonated charges downstream of Bismarck, North Dakota to clear an ice jam which was causing flooding in the city causing an evacuation of 1,700 persons. There were three million sandbags, rolls of poly film Hesco bastion flood walls, and water pumps sent out by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to North Dakota. [...] Both North Dakota and Manitoba used backhoes from the river bank and from bridges, but these machines had a 20 ft reach for a 0.25 mi river. A Chinook helicopter was deployed with a 1400 kg concrete weight to try to break up an ice jam, but only small pieces of ice broke away. [...] The North Dakota National Guard used 160 lb of C-4 plastic explosives on the 3 ft ice placed into 80 holes. The ice was then coated with road salt to hasten melting. The Army Corps of Engineers also resorted to using sand, salt, chemicals and drilling to alleviate the ice jams. [...] The Manitoba government chose not to use dynamite, as explosives work well on large ice sheets but not as well on broken and fused ice. To set the dynamite, holes need to be drilled in the ice, which would require someone to hang suspended from a helicopter. The end result of dynamite forms a hole centrally in the ice without loosening up the ice jam blockage to allow water to flow past. Manitoba purchased five new certified emergency response trailers (CERTs), which are 15 m tubes with 60 compartments which can be filled with water and used to build dikes. These tubes take 10 minutes to fill up and provide the same protection as 500 sandbags. Volunteers created over 600,000 sandbags to shore up defences against the Red River and unpredictable flows caused by ice jams. Dikes were placed along the shoreline within the city to protect neighbourhoods against ice jam flooding. Over 1,600 volunteers came out since April 1 to assist with creating sandbag dikes which were built 20.5 ft high. Frozen <b>culverts</b> and sewer <b>inlets</b> were cleared to allow runoff from meltwaters and floodwaters. Amphibex excavator icebreakers were at work breaking up ice flows on the Red River. [...] Ice breakers and backhoes were to be strategically placed along the Red River Floodway, which might have needed to be opened before the ice was fully melted. Officials examined past ice jams and provided contingency plans if the Floodway jammed upstream of bridges or on tight corners. On Easter Sunday, April 12, Winnipeg was clear of ice blocks and ice jams. [...] Sightseers traveling by car, boat, kayak and anyone ignoring road closures were being ticketed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police as they were hampering ice clearing operations. [...] Residents of the rural municipalities of St. Andrews and St. Clements were given evacuation alerts on Good Friday. Some chose to remain behind, and rescue efforts commenced for them over the Easter week-end. [...] Homes were smashed in and knocked off their basements and footings by 7 ft sheets of ice.|$|R
