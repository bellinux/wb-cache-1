40|$|Drawing on {{fieldwork}} in the punk {{scenes of the}} UK, USA and Australia, this article critically examines Christianity and holistic spirituality within punk’s <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> subculture, a movement rejecting alcohol, drugs, and casual sex. Focusing on conceptualizations of salvation within <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> Christianity and <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> holistic spirituality, this article engages Heelas and Woodhead’s notion of the “subjectivization’”of contemporary religious identities to compare and contrast these forms of new religious practice. <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> Christianity and <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> holistic spirituality are shown to demonstrate the double movement of the ‘desacralization’ of religion in late modernity. <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> Christianity illustrates the emergence of religion in traditionally secular cultural spaces, while <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> holistic spirituality illustrates a movement away from the transcendent and supernatural, towards the location of salvation within wholly material concerns and therapeutic practices...|$|R

This chapter examines the Australian <b>straight</b> <b>edge</b> hard-core subculture by combining Bourdieuian theories of distinction with the notion of reflexivity. As a Newcastle hard-core enthusiast observed, straightedgers 'stand out'. It is argued that the intense reflexivity demanded by the <b>straight</b> <b>edge</b> 'oath' is both binding and bonding, forging the strong resilience of the subculture. Other hardcore fans are to some extent unsettled by the inferred moral superiority of <b>straight</b> <b>edge,</b> which adds a certain piquancy to their own processes of reflexivity as they move towards adulthood...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Straight</b> <b>edge</b> (sometimes {{abbreviated}} sXe or {{signified by}} XXX or X) is a subculture of hardcore punk whose adherents refrain from using alcohol, tobacco and other recreational drugs, {{in reaction to}} the excesses of punk subculture.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the phenomenon of}} <b>straight</b> <b>edge</b> {{in the context of}} Australian youth culture, with examples from Newcastle, New South Wales. Two claims of USA-based research on <b>straight</b> <b>edge</b> youth subculture are critically examined – representations of ‘hypermasculinity’, and the ‘new neo-conservatism’. Preliminary research conducted to point the way to a larger project indicates: Firstly, that much of <b>straight</b> <b>edge</b> gendered subculture strongly resembles hardcore punk subculture, and there is constant mixing between the two, despite the application of the three basic rules of <b>straight</b> <b>edge</b> – no sex, no drugs/alcohol, no smoking. Fighting, for example, is common to both, challenging claims about the new conservatism. Secondly, rather than representing the achievement of ‘hypermasculinity’, for some male youth in Newcastle struggling with the successful accomplishment of ‘ordinary’ hegemonic masculinity in the night-time economy, <b>straight</b> <b>edge</b> provisionally appears to function as a temporary, clean-living, largely female-free, subcultural space of refuge...|$|R

The following week, Mysterio interrupted an initiation ceremony, in which Punk was shaving the heads of three men to induct them into the <b>Straight</b> <b>Edge</b> Society, and mocked Punk, claiming everyone would be laughing at Punk when he was shaved bald at Over the Limit.
