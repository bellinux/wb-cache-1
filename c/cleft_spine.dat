40|$|Name of the diploma thesis: Condition of {{patients}} with the diagnosis of spina bifida cystica with myelomeningocele and subsequent rehabilitation intervention Goal of the work: Spina bifida (<b>cleft</b> <b>spine)</b> is a congenital defect resulting from failure of fusion of embryologie halves of vertebral arches. Spina bifida belongs {{to the group of}} congenital abnormalities ofthe central nervous system, which manifest themselves through neural tissue anomalies and bony changes of the spine. Since {{there is not a single}} Czech publication dedicated to the diagnosis of spina bifida, the first goal of this diploma thesis was to thoroughly describe the diagnosis of spina bifida, with special emphasis on cystical spina bifida, and to introduce opinions of the Czech and mainly intemational experts on this issue. In the second part ofthis diploma thesis, based on a case study ofthree patients with the diagnosis of congenital spina bifida cystica with myelomeningocele, the goal was to compare the historically, as well as currently applied rehabilitation treatment of these patients and to confirm that the rehabilitation procedures differed, depending on the height ofthe lesion and the availability ofqualified rehabilitation care. Solution method: To process the gathered information about spina bifida from specialized [...] ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Neurotransmitter vesicles {{are known}} to {{concentrate}} hydrogen ions (or protons), the simplest ion, and to release them during neurotransmission. Furthermore, receptors highly sensitive to protons, acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), were previously localized {{on the opposite side}} of the synaptic <b>cleft</b> on dendritic <b>spines.</b> Now, recent experiments provide some of the strongest support to date that protons function as a neurotransmitter in mice, crossing synapses onto medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), activating ASICs, and ultimately suppressing drug abuse-related behaviors...|$|R
40|$|One {{grotesque}} catfish specimen {{was collected}} in Zhangjiang River (upper reach of a secondary tributary of Hongshuihe River) in Libo County, Guizhou Province, China. This specimen bears surprising character of four dorsal fins, {{which have not}} appeared in any other silurid fishes. But other morphological characters, such as two pairs of barbels, lower jaw projecting beyond upper jaw, the first dorsal fin with one un-branched ray and 4 branched rays, mouth <b>cleft</b> shallow, anterior <b>spine</b> margin of pectoral spine prominently serrated, vomerine tooth band continuous across midline, show much similarities with that of Silurus asotus. This result supports that this variant originated from S. asotus for some special causations. The present study provided description and comparison with S. asotus...|$|R
40|$|A breastfed male infant aged {{six weeks}} {{presented}} with constipation and weight loss. He {{was the third}} born to a 33 year old mother in a non-consanguineous marriage. Both siblings were normal. Abnormalities observed were: short length (crown-toheel 46 cm), disproportionate body proportions, short barrel shaped chest (Figure 1), a relatively large head, kyphoscoliosis, enlarged knees and elbows with limited range of active and passive movements, bilateral inguinal herniae, flat facies, prominent eyes and a wide posterior cleft palate. Cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal and neurological examinations were normal. X rays showed vertebral <b>clefts</b> in thoracic <b>spine</b> (Figures 2 & 3), flared metaphyses and large epiphyses in femur and tibia (Figure 4). Expressed breast milk fed using a long teat corrected weight loss and constipation. Cleft palate repair was planned for nine months of age. Herniotomy was performed. On follow up at four months he had satisfactory weight gain and normal development...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: We {{present a}} variant of a split cord {{malformation}} with coexisting segmental spinal dysgenesis. CT myelography showed the left hemicord with a small remnant of subarachnoid space running through an intravertebral <b>cleft</b> in a <b>spine</b> anomaly. The left hemicord had no apparent intradual connection to the upper cord on any radiologic examination, though functional electrical stimulation studies revealed an intact efferent pathway that connected the left hemicord to the main spinal cord. A split cordmalformation (SCM), also called a diastemato-myelia, is a rare spinal anomaly and refers to a sagittal division of the spinal cord into 2 symmetrical or asymmetrical hemicords. A variant of this malformation associated with a split of the spinal column, spinal bony spurs, myeloceles, my-elomeningoceles, lipomas, and dermal sinuses has been previ-ously reported in the literature. 1, 2 We report an unusual case of SCM with segmental vertebral anomalies. Case Report A 5 -year-old girl was born as a low-birth-weight baby of 1190 g at 36 gestational weeks. Pregnancy and family history were unremarkable...|$|R
40|$|The biocultural and {{epidemiological}} {{approaches have}} been used as investigative methods by which to assess the prevalence of birth defects of the axial skeleton among five English Medieval population samples (Raunds Fumells, Northamptonshire; the hospital/almshouse of St James and St Mary Magdalene, Chichester, West Sussex; St Helen-on-the-Walls, York; Wharram Percy, East Yorkshire, and the Augustinian Friary cemetery, Hull, Humberside). The author hypothesises that Medieval urban populations produced offspring with higher frequencies of skeletal defects because they were subject to the adverse health-mediating effects of higher population density. These include poor quality, frequently overcrowded living conditions, poor sanitation, increased rates of disease threat and transmission, poorer quality food and drink due to pollution and adulteration, and greater levels of industrial-related air and water pollution. The author proposes that this response was a consequence of the impaired interaction between a population-wide compromised nutritional status and a co-existing weakened immune response. It is proposed that rural populations will express significantly lower frequencies of the same skeletal defects, as they are not subject to the same adverse environmental effects of population density and urban living conditions. The results support this hypothesis among the four populations derived from burial grounds associated with residential areas, whilst the Hull population expresses a rural pattern of defect prevalence, raising questions of possibly limited, exclusive access to burial at that site, available to non-urban dwellers. The author suggests that similar reproductive effects may be found today in populations undergoing demographic transition, for example, those experiencing the process of urbanisation in the developing world, or those migrating to the developed West. The author also shows how the results, when viewed alongside the medical literature, may indicate the presence of soft-tissue anomalies which are invisible to those working with dry bone.
