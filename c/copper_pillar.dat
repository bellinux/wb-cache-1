40|$|Abstract. With the {{excellent}} thermal conductivity and the compatibility to micro electromechanical systems technology, silicon {{is widely used}} in micro heat pipes (MHPs). Copper shows higher heat transfer capability and capillary traction than silicon. <b>Copper</b> <b>pillars</b> modified microgrooves were fabricated on the silicon wafer using electroforming technique in this paper. Water contact angle measurements and thermal behavior tests were employed to the fabricated microgrooves and MHPs. Under the input power of 4 W, how the working fluid flowed in the microgrooves and steam chamber was easily observed by digital camera. The experiments demonstrated the working fluid flowed via <b>copper</b> <b>pillars</b> instead of the silicon microgrooves due to the adhesive force between working fluid and <b>copper</b> <b>pillars</b> were larger than that between working fluid and silicon microgrooves. This work showed <b>copper</b> <b>pillars</b> had a better capillary traction than the silicon microgrooves, and could make the MHP work as a vapor chamber...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of nano-crystalline <b>copper</b> <b>pillars</b> were investigated by both experimental methods and Molecular Dynamic Simulations in this study. Electron beam lithography and electroplating {{were used to}} fabricate the nano-crystalline <b>copper</b> <b>pillars</b> with various cross-sectional geometries, namely solid core, hollow, c-shaped, and x-shaped. These as-fabricated <b>copper</b> <b>pillars</b> possess three different average grain sizes, which were achieved by changing the compositions of the plating solution. Uniaxial micro-compression tests were applied to deform these nano-crystalline columnar structures. Classical Hall-Petch relationship was observed between the large-grain specimens and medium-grain specimens. An inversed Hall-Petch relationship emerged as the grain size continued {{to go down to}} the small grain size region. The mechanical behavior exhibited no signs of sensitivity to the cross-sectional geometries. To understand the deformation mechanisms, Molecular Dynamic Simulations were performed on nano- crystalline <b>copper</b> <b>pillars</b> with different dimensions. The as-constructed models displayed different mechanical behaviors under compressive and tensile deformation. This so-called compression-tension asymmetry was believed to be associated with free surface alongside the nano-crystalline pillars, where the free surface energy made opposite contributions under compression and tension. An inversed Hall-Petch trend was also observed between the nano-crystalline copper columnar structure with the grain size of 13 and 6 nm...|$|R
40|$|A novel wafer level {{packaging}} process for phosphor converted LED {{is presented in}} this paper. The core {{of this process is}} the fabrication of a silicon substrate with cavities for phosphor printing and through-silicon <b>copper</b> <b>pillars</b> for 3 D interconnection. A double-side polished 4 -inch wafer is used as the substrate. In the present process, DRIE is applied to {{the back side of the}} silicon wafer firstly for forming blind vias. The next step is to perform DRIE from the front side to create cavities for LED chip mounting and phosphor printing. Copper is then electroplated to fill the blind vias to form <b>copper</b> <b>pillars.</b> After the <b>copper</b> plating, KOH etching is applied to the front side to further etch the cavities in order to expose the embedded <b>copper</b> <b>pillars.</b> Afterwards, solder is plated on the exposed tips of <b>copper</b> <b>pillars</b> at the bottom of the cavities. Finally, the copper overburden on the back side of the wafer is patterned as the redistribution layer for the next level of interconnection. Subsequent to the fabrication of silicon substrate, blue LEDs are flip-chip mounted on the pre-plated solder bumps in the cavities. Reflow soldering is then conducted to fix the LED chips. Following an epoxy dispensing process, yellow phosphor powder is printed into the cavity for color tuning. The pre-dispensed epoxy is then UV-cured to serve as the phosphor powder binder and the LED chip encapsulant. The present configuration offers a structure with low profile and compact footprint for LED wafer level packaging. The fabrication process is described in detail in this paper. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R
5000|$|The thermal <b>copper</b> <b>pillar</b> bump, {{also known}} as the [...] "thermal bump", is a {{thermoelectric}} device made from thin-film thermoelectric material embedded in flip chip interconnects (in particular <b>copper</b> <b>pillar</b> solder bumps) for use in electronics and optoelectronic packaging, including: flip chip packaging of CPU and GPU integrated circuits (chips), laser diodes, and semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA). Unlike conventional solder bumps that provide an electrical path and a mechanical connection to the package, thermal bumps act as solid-state heat pumps and add thermal management functionality locally on the surface of a chip or to another electrical component. The diameter of a thermal bump is 238 μm and 60 μm high.|$|E

5000|$|Recent {{trends in}} {{high-density}} interconnects {{have led to}} the use of <b>copper</b> <b>pillar</b> solder bumps (CPB) for CPU and GPU packaging. [...] CPBs are an attractive replacement for traditional solder bumps because they provide a fixed stand-off independent of pitch. This is extremely important as most of the high-end products are underfilled and a smaller standoff may create difficulties in getting the underfill adhesive to flow under the die.|$|E

40|$|Flip chip {{is one of}} the {{packaging}} techniques for high-performance components. There is a greater demand on integrating more functions in a smaller chip nowadays. This leads to the increase of I/O density. Organic substrate is the bottleneck of the high-density packaging. A silicon interposer with through-silicon vias (TSVs) is commonly used to provide a platform with a high wiring density to redistribute I/Os. After I/O redistribution, larger solder joints with a larger pitch can be used to connect the interposer to the organic substrate. In this paper, a TSV-based silicon interposer with a cavity and <b>copper</b> <b>pillars</b> for 3 -D packaging is presented. The cavity hosts the flip-chip device. There are copper-filled TSVs in the cavity to provide the electrical interconnections to the backside of the interposer. Flip-chip solder bumps are electroplated on the <b>copper</b> <b>pillars.</b> Subsequent to the flip-chip assembly process, the device is seated in the cavity entirely. The backside of the flip chip is lower than that of the surface of the interposer. This provides a better environment for further die stacking {{on the surface of the}} interposer. The microfabrication process of the proposed silicon interposer with TSVs in cavities is discussed in detail...|$|R
50|$|The thermal bump was {{developed}} by Nextreme Thermal Solutions as a method for integrating active thermal management functionality at the chip level {{in the same manner}} that transistors, resistors and capacitors are integrated in conventional circuit designs today. Nextreme chose the <b>copper</b> <b>pillar</b> bump as an integration strategy due to its widespread acceptance by Intel, Amkor and other industry leaders as the method for connecting microprocessors and other advanced electronics devices to various surfaces during a process referred to as “flip-chip” packaging. The thermal bump can be integrated {{as a part of the}} standard flip-chip process (Figure 1) or integrated as discrete devices.|$|E
50|$|Figure 3 {{shows an}} SEM {{cross-section}} of a TE leg. Here it is {{demonstrated that the}} thermal bump is structurally identical to a CPB with an extra layer, the TE layer, incorporated into the stack-up. The addition of the TE layer transforms a standard <b>copper</b> <b>pillar</b> bump into a thermal bump. This element, when properly configured electrically and thermally, provides active thermoelectric heat transfer {{from one side of}} the bump to the other side. The direction of heat transfer is dictated by the doping type of the thermoelectric material (either a P-type or N-type semiconductor) and the direction of electric current passing through the material. This type of thermoelectric heat transfer is known as the Peltier effect. Conversely, if heat is allowed to pass {{from one side of the}} thermoelectric material to the other, a current will be generated in the material in a phenomenon known as the Seebeck effect. The Seebeck effect is essentially the reverse of the Peltier effect. In this mode, electrical power is generated from the flow of heat in the TE element. The structure shown in Figure 3 is capable of operating in both the Peltier and Seebeck modes, though not simultaneously.|$|E

However the self-heating effect and the derivative Kirk effect limit the PA performance to achieve higher efficiency. The <b>copper</b> <b>pillar</b> bump provides several advantages compared to conventional wire-bonding technique such as packaging size shrinkage, removing noise-radiating wires, and more importantly the better heat dissipation. The <b>copper</b> <b>pillar</b> bump can be formed directly on the HBT emitter fingers area through the appropriate thermal shunt inter-connecting metal, which can suppress self-heating and thermal coupling effect.

40|$|Electrochemical {{behaviors}} of the base electrolyte containing different additives were investigated by galvanostatic potential transient measurements (GM), cyclic voltammetry tests (CV) and potentiostatic measurements. Copper deposits on sputtering copper seed from physical vapor deposition (PVD) were examined by a scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction spectra. Cross sections of <b>copper</b> <b>pillars</b> and fine line patterns were observed by metallographic microscope. GM result revealed ethylene oxide-propylene oxide co-polymer (EO/PO) performed a further inhibition on copper deposition {{in the presence of}} 60 ppm chloride ions as the increment of EO/PO concentration. GM, CV and potentiostatic results indicated that copper deposition was accelerated by synergetic effects of additives in the base electrolyte containing 60 ppm chloride ions, 20 mg/L EO/PO and 0. 7 mg/L bis-(sodium sulfopropyl) -disul?de. Sputtering PVD copper seed with even deposit surface was recommended to form the uniformity of copper deposition through increasing the growing density of copper particles. Oscillatory was employed to form uniform distribution of copper deposits in thickness. Copper grain growth was preferentially [111] textured.

40|$|Complex, high-integrated and {{high-performance}} microelectronic {{systems that}} include an interposer-solution {{become more and}} more dominant in the field of advanced 2. 5 / 3 D system integration. In such systems, for example required in network and image processing applications, the different ICs (e. g. processors and memories) are placed on a silicon interposer, which allow shorter interconnect lines between the elements, improving the signal transmission. The example system used throughout this paper combines an ASIC for signal processing with a high-performance memory. These two chips are placed as bare dies side-by-side on a silicon interposer using <b>copper</b> <b>pillars.</b> The interposer itself is located on a PCB. The good thermal conductivity of the copper structures within the interposer (i. e., top and bottom metal layers and the through-silicon-vias), in combination with the <b>copper</b> <b>pillars</b> underneath the dies, enable a high-performance and effective thermal behavior of the system; the heat produced by the processor and memory dies is dissipated through these elements to the PCB substrate that supports the system. However, in complex microelectronic systems that include arrays of different metal layers, TSVs, <b>copper</b> <b>pillars,</b> solder balls etc., their modeling and simulation can be an expensive procedure. This is especially a problem in early design phases where many different technologies options (e. g., packaging variants) have to be evaluated. Moreover, a real design exploration can be time consuming in many cases. In order to simplify the modeling procedure and speed up simulation, we present an alternative approach to derive simulation models from system descriptions, reduce the simulation time, and ensure the reliability of the obtained results. The array of <b>copper</b> <b>pillars</b> of the system is substituted with simplified blocks with the same volume and material properties. In terms of simulation, the meshing of cuboids and rectangular blocks is easier than meshing cylinders or spheres. The simulation time of the simplified model can be significantly reduced. First simplifications already result in 10 - 15 % shorter simulation time (down to 2 mins reduction). The obtained numerical results are similar to the ones extracted prior to the aforementioned simplifications; the value deviation ranged between 1. 5 - 3 % for simulation cases up to 10 W applied power. However, the possible degree of simplification is strongly dependent on the application specific boundary conditions. As an example, for high-power applications; by further increasing the applied power, larger deviations can be observed (up to 7. 8 % for 25 W power, according to our simulation). Additionally, we propose an efficient solution in order to simulate the hot-spots inside the dies; they are performing complex and high-speed functions that result in heat concentration at specific points of the IC. Finally, another important parameter examined is the influence of the thermal interface material (TIM) in the behavior of the system with respect to the heat dissipated through the system if a heat-sink is included in the model...|$|R

40|$|Compared with {{traditional}} flip chip solder bump, <b>copper</b> <b>pillar</b> (copper post) with greater conductivity could improve reliability, electrical and thermal characteristics. Intel last year announced to fully utilize this innovative double-layer <b>copper</b> <b>pillar</b> {{to replace the}} conventional single-layer bump in dual-core processor. Electroforming featuring higher deposition rate and finer pitch is widely recognized as the best method to form any solder bump. Poor coplanarity inducing two common packaging failures, short circuit and broken circuit, substantially decreases reliability and yield due to non-uniform electronic current distribution. This paper thus develops a novel micro-polishing process aimed at grinding the rugged electroformed <b>copper</b> <b>pillar</b> into uniform one. Predominately in mechanical polishing force gives the polisher higher material removal rate (MRR) to effectively narrow the overall coplanarity from 33 ± 2. 5 µm (Coplanarity= 7. 5 %) to 28 ± 1 µm (Coplanarity= 3 %) with only 90 µm pithch size within 2 minutes at the polishing rate of 4 - 7 µm/min. Its polishing rate is 40 - 70 times faster than that of CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing). Most importantly, the coplanarity at each single die after reflow could be precisely controlled to 26 ± 0. 5 µm (Coplanarity= 1 %).

40|$|Scientific {{research}} in nanotechnology has enabled advances in a {{diverse range of}} applications, such as: electronics, chemical sensing, and cancer treatment. In order to transition these nanotechnology-driven innovations out of the laboratory and into real-world applications, the resilience and mechanical reliability of nanoscale structures must be well understood {{in order to preserve}} functionality under real-world operating environments. Understanding the mechanical properties of nanoscale materials is especially important because several authors have shown that single crystalline metal pillars produced through focused-ion-beam milling have unique properties when the pillar diameter, D, approaches nanotechnology-relevant dimensions. The strength, σ, of these pillars is size-dependent and is well described through a power-law relation showing that smaller is stronger: σ∝D^(-n), where n is the exponent and is found to be 0. 5 ≤n≤ 1. 0 in face-centered-cubic metals. In this work, the fundamental deformation mechanisms governing the size-dependent mechanical properties are investigated through uniaxial compression and tension tests of electroplated single crystalline <b>copper</b> <b>pillars</b> with diameters between 75 nm and 1000 nm. At larger pillar diameters, D > 125 nm, these <b>copper</b> <b>pillars</b> are shown to obey a similar size-dependent regime, demonstrating that the “smaller is stronger” phenomenon {{is a function of the}} pillar microstructure, as opposed to the fabrication route. Furthermore, the dominant dislocation mechanism in this size-dependent regime is shown to be the result of single-arm, or spiral, sources. At smaller pillar diameters, D≤ 125 nm, a strain-rate-dependent mechanism transition is observed through both the size-strength relation and also quantitative, experimental measures of the activation volume. This new deformation regime is characterized by a size-independent strength and is governed by surface dislocation nucleation, a thermally activated mechanism sensitive to both temperature and strain-rate. Classical, analytical models of surface source-nucleation are shown to be insufficient to describe either the quantitative strength or the nucleation site preference. As a result, a combination of atomistic chain-of-states simulations and semi-analytical continuum models are developed in order to achieve a realistic, intuitive understanding of surface nucleation processes...|$|R

The main scientific innovation and relevance introduced by this work have been applied to industrial solar cell production and on silicon wafer metal bumps formation for the IC interconnection (i. e. <b>copper</b> <b>pillars).</b> Such new technique allows to touch in specific defined positions the silicon wafer in order to perform any kind of wet processing (e. g. etching, cleaning and/or plating) without the need of any protective resist. To investigate on pendant dynamic liquid drops and dynamic liquid meniscus use of computational fluid dynamic technique (i. e. numerical techniques to accurately predict fluid flows) was followed and is presented. An experimental setup has been built to validate the calculations. Numerical results showed a good agreement with experimental ones. Prototypes heads, using stereo-lithography systems, were developed and localized selective plating without the need of lithography step was performed on silicon. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R
