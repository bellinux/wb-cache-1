The line of trees that cuts across the base <b>court</b> <b>today</b> is a relatively modern mid-19th century addition, and originally this court would have been more open, save for the collegiate chapel that once {{stood in front of the}} stables. Destroyed in 1524, only the chapel's foundations remain. Each of the courts was designed to be used for different purposes: the base court was considered a relatively public area, with the left and right courts used for more private occasions.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Wolsey, Archbishop of York, Chief Minister and {{favourite}} of Henry VIII, {{took over}} the site of Hampton Court Palace in 1514. It had previously been a property of the Order of St John of Jerusalem. Over the following seven years, Wolsey spent lavishly (200,000 Crowns) to build the finest palace in England at Hampton <b>Court.</b> <b>Today,</b> little of Wolsey's building work remains unchanged. The first courtyard, the Base Court, (B on plan), was his creation, as was the second, inner gatehouse (C) {{which leads to the}} Clock Court (D) (Wolsey's seal remains visible over the entrance arch of the clock tower) which contained his private rooms (O on plan). The Base Court contained forty-four lodgings reserved for guests, while the second <b>court</b> (<b>today,</b> Clock Court) contained the very best rooms the state apartments reserved for the King and his family. Henry VIII stayed in the state apartments as Wolsey's guest immediately after their completion in 1525.|$|E

[...] Ante, at 8 (emphasis added). Of course Gerstein did not say, nor do I contend, that an [...] "immediate" [...] determination is required.

2500|$|One of the {{principal}} terms that accompanies the employment relationship is that the employer will provide a [...] "safe system of work". As the industrial revolution developed, accidents from a hazardous working environment were a front line target for labour legislation, {{as a series of}} Factories Acts, from 1802, required minimum standards in workplace cleanliness, ventilation, fencing machinery, not to mention restrictions on child labour and limits to the working day. These Acts typically targeted particular kinds of workplaces, such as mines, or textile mills, before the more generalised approach took hold now seen in the Factories Act 1961. That applies to any workplace where an article is made or changed, or animals are kept and slaughtered. The Employer's Liability (Defective Equipment) Act 1969 made employers automatically liable for equipment with defects supplied by third parties. Because isolated employees lack the technical skill, time, training to litigate, such regulation's primary line of enforcement was through inspectors or agencies before matters went to <b>court.</b> <b>Today</b> the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, enforced by the Health and Safety Executive, is the main law. The HSE can delegate enforcement to local authorities, whose inspectors have the power to investigate and require changes to workplace systems. In addition, HSWA 1974 section 2 foresees that employees will set up their own workplace committees, elected by the employees and with the power to codetermine health and safety matters with management. Spelling out the general duties found in HSWA 1974, are a set of health and safety regulations, which must also stay in line with the European-wide harmonised requirements of the Health and Safety Directive.|$|E
2500|$|In Hudson v. McMillian, a {{prisoner}} had been beaten, garnering a cracked lip, broken dental plate, loosened teeth, cuts, and bruises. Although {{these were not}} [...] "serious injuries", the court believed, it held that [...] "the use of excessive physical force against {{a prisoner}} may constitute {{cruel and unusual punishment}} even though the inmate does not suffer serious injury." [...] Dissenting, Thomas wrote that, in his view, [...] "a use of force that causes only insignificant harm to a prisoner may be immoral, it may be tortious, it may be criminal, and it may even be remediable under other provisions of the Federal Constitution, but it is not 'cruel and unusual punishment'. In concluding to the contrary, the <b>Court</b> <b>today</b> goes far beyond our precedents." [...] Thomas's vote—in one of his first cases after joining the court—was an early example of his willingness to be the sole dissenter (Scalia later joined the opinion). Thomas's opinion was criticized by the seven-member majority of the court, which wrote that, by comparing physical assault to other prison conditions such as poor prison food, Thomas's opinion ignored [...] "the concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency that animate the Eighth Amendment". According to historian David Garrow, Thomas's dissent in Hudson was a [...] "classic call for federal judicial restraint, reminiscent of views that were held by Felix Frankfurter and John M. Harlan II a generation earlier, but editorial criticism rained down on him". Thomas would later respond to the accusation [...] "that I supported the beating of prisoners in that case.
