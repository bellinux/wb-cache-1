40|$|Abstract Background Bovine {{brucellosis}} {{caused by}} Brucella abortus is endemic in most large <b>commercial</b> and smallholder <b>cattle</b> farms of Zimbabwe, while brucellosis in other domestic animals is rare. The diagnosis of brucellosis is mainly accomplished using serological tests. However, some Brucella spp. have been isolated from clinical {{cases in the}} field and kept in culture collection but their biochemical profiles were not documented. We report biochemical profiling and AMOS-PCR characterization of some of these field isolates of Brucella originating from both <b>commercial</b> and smallholder <b>cattle</b> farming sectors of Zimbabwe. Findings Fourteen isolates of Brucella from culture collection were typed using biochemical profiles, agglutination by monospecific antisera, susceptibility to Brucella -specific bacteriophages and by AMOS-PCR that amplifies species- specific IS 711. The results of the biochemical profiles for B. abortus biovar 1 (11 isolates) and biovar 2 (2 isolates) were consistent with those of reference strains. A single isolate from a goat originating from a smallholder mixed animal farm was identified as B. melitensis biovar 1. The AMOS-PCR produced DNA products of sizes 498 bp and 731 bp for B. abortus (biovar 1 and 2) and B. melitensis biovar 1, respectively. Conclusion We concluded that the biochemical profiles and AMOS-PCR characterization were consistent with their respective species and biovars. B. abortus biovar 1 {{is likely to be the}} predominant cause of brucellosis in both <b>commercial</b> and smallholder <b>cattle</b> farms in Zimbabwe. </p...|$|R
40|$|Dairy cattle farms have a {{well-known}} environmental impact that affects all ecological compartments: air, soil, water and biosphere [1]. Dairy cattle farming {{are a significant}} source of anthropogenic gases from enteric fermentation, manure storage and land application, mainly ammonia (NH 3), nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4). The emission of such gases represents not only an environmental problem but also leads to energy and nitrogen (N) losses in ruminant production systems [2 - 5]. Several efforts are required on the development of new technologies and strategies that mitigate gaseous emissions, N losses and improve the efficiency of the energy and N cycles [6, 7]. In the Northwest of Portugal, dairy cattle production has a major impact on the economy, with strong repercussions at national scale. Therefore, our Ph. D. thesis project aims to: a) Study natural supplements as additives in the dairy cattle diet towards a decrease in GHG emissions from feeding operations; b) Compare <b>commercial</b> dairy <b>cattle</b> diets with and without additives on gaseous emissions from manure deposited in a simulated concrete floor; c) Assess the concentrations and emissions of NH 3 and greenhouse gases from <b>commercial</b> dairy <b>cattle</b> facilities; d) Evaluate the effects of different additives on lowering gaseous emissions from dairy cattle excreta, using a laboratory system simulating a dairy house concrete floor...|$|R
