40|$|The {{extraction}} of <b>cenospheres</b> from fly ash {{and the study}} of their industrial applications have been extensively increased in the recent years. The efficient recovery of <b>cenospheres</b> without polluting the ash ponds or lagoons is a serious concern of the global community. <b>Cenospheres</b> of different density and particle sizes are now available in markets for various applications.

This research also incorporates the fabrication of a new dry separator system and subsequent modifications of the separator to extract <b>cenospheres</b> from fly ash. The dry method of separation of <b>cenospheres</b> from fly ash can be performed using a centrifugal air classifier.

The frequency dependent dielectric and conductivity behaviour of flyash <b>cenosphere</b> filled low density polyethylene (LDPE) polymer composites have been studied. Appearance of peak in the dielectric loss curves for all the concentrations confirms the presence of relaxing dipoles in the cenosphere/LDPE composites. The effect of filler distribution on the dielectric constant is examined and the observed differences are attributed to the differences in two kinds of interfaces present: one formed between the touching <b>cenosphere</b> particles and the other formed between LDPE and <b>cenosphere.</b> With the increase of <b>cenosphere</b> content dielectric constant decreased gradually.

40|$|A small {{percentage}} of the particles, present in the pulverized coal ash, consists of thin-walled hollow spheres or <b>cenospheres.</b> Their quantity depends on the carbon and iron contents present in the ash.

30|$|<b>Cenospheres</b> are {{composed}} mainly of silica, alumina and iron oxides, and have unique properties such as sphericity, inert, lower density than water, {{and they are}} waterproof making them useful {{in a variety of}} applications. Generally, <b>cenospheres</b> make up 1  %– 3  % by weight of the total CFA produced. They have valuable industrial applications, such as oil well drilling, ceramics, plastic, paint, coatings, polymer fillers, building products, buoyaancy, and as low dielectric constant substrates (Huo et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2011). <b>Cenospheres</b> are used for water purification such as the removal of excess fluoride from drinking water. In this process, magnesia loaded <b>cenospheres</b> are produced using a relatively simple wet impregnation method with magnesium chloride (Xu et al. 2011). <b>Cenospheres</b> are used as a carrier because of their low weight, sphericity, non-toxicity, and high strength. They are ideal for incorporation into materials such as silicone rubber in order to increase the conductivity. In addition, they enhance the rubber’s suitability as an electromagnetic wave absorbing material, which can be used in electronic and radar applications (Pang et al. 2011).|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} methods for the {{separation}} of <b>cenospheres</b> from CFA. Traditionally, <b>cenospheres</b> were removed from CFA via float-sink in settling lagoons. This simple procedure allows potentially toxic elements to be leached and requires a large space and significant time (Hirajima et al. 2010). Alternatively, a triboelectric separation system was used (Gurupira et al. 2001) but this technique requires that the spheres have a specific gravity ≤ 1. Some solid silica particles with specific gravity of ≥ 1 may contain gas bubbles which over their specific gravity so that they mimic <b>cenospheres</b> during this process, rendering it less effective and attractive. Other studies that {{have looked at the}} extraction of <b>cenospheres</b> on a wet basis. In US Patent No. 4121945 (1978), CFA is mixed with water to form a slurry then a frothing agent is added and <b>cenospheres</b> lighter than water are skimmed. US Patent No. 4652433 (1987) looked at another method where CFA is separated into fine and coarse fractions and the coarse fraction is then mixed with water, subsequently the <b>cenospheres</b> are removed by skimming. These methods have some disadvantages. Wet processing caused environmental problems and imposed space restrictions. In addition, these methods only collect <b>cenospheres</b> with specific gravity ≤ 1.0; those that float on water. Also, these processes are not suitable for CFA that contains 10  % or more lime because high Ca bearing CFA (such as ASTM C 618 Class C fly ash) has cementations properties when mixed with water and when pozolanic reactions occur the material may harden. When using these wet methods many <b>cenospheres</b> can be trapped in agglomerated and/or hardened masses before flotation occurs. This problem was solved by a few recent US Patents (No. 0190327 A 1 2008, No. 8074804 B 2 2011, and No. 0050519 A 1 2012) where <b>cenospheres</b> were separated from CFA in a dry state by using air as the fluid media for the separation. In one of the processes, CFA is separated into narrow particle size fractions, followed by density separation using a fluidized bed of air, preferable in the absence of water by dry screening, and then an optional further particle size separation. The advantages of this technique are that it can yield nearly 100  % <b>cenospheres</b> and it avoids agglomeration of ash having high Ca content.|$|R

Coke and <b>cenosphere</b> emissions from HFO combustion need {{to be controlled by}} particulate control equipment such as electrostatic precipitators, and collection effectiveness is impacted by the properties of these particulates. The <b>cenosphere</b> formation is a function of HFO composition, which varies depending on the source of the HFO. Numerical modelling of the <b>cenosphere</b> formation mechanism presented in this paper is an economical method of characterising <b>cenosphere</b> formation potential for HFO in comparison to experimental analysis of individual HFO samples, leading to better control and collection. In the present work, a novel numerical model is developed for understanding the global <b>cenosphere</b> formation mechanism. The critical diameter of the <b>cenosphere</b> is modelled based on the balance between two pressures developed in an HFO droplet. First is the pressure (Prpf) developed at the interface of the liquid surface and the inner surface of the accumulated coke due to the flow restriction of volatile components from the interior of the droplet. Second is the pressure due to the outer shell strength (PrC) gained from van der Walls energy of the coke layers and surface energy. In this present study it is considered that when PrC ≥ Prpf the outer shell starts to harden. The internal motion in the shell layer ceases and the outer diameter (DSOut) of the shell is then fixed.

40|$|Electricity {{generated}} from stationary coal-fired power stations {{has been playing}} {{an important role in}} powering the global economy and is projected to continue its key role in the foreseeable future. However, substantial quantities of fly ash are produced from coal-fired power stations as solid wastes every year, not only exerting significant pressure on waste management but also having adversely impacts on environment. Therefore, there has been considerable R&D to develop technologies for minimizing these adverse impacts of fly ash via various routes e. g. fly ash utilisation. Ash cenospheres are light-weight, thin-walled and hollow ash particles as part of the fly ash produced from solid fuels combustion. These light-weight ash particles are considered to be valuable materials for manufacturing various value-added products. Since almost half a century ago, substantial R&D was conducted to characterize ash cenospheres and understand their formation mechanisms during the combustion of pulverised solid fuels e. g. coal. Unfortunately, the fundamental mechanisms responsible for ash <b>cenosphere</b> formation during pulverized solid fuels combustion are still largely unclear. Therefore, the research program in this PhD study aims to carry out a systematic investigation on ash <b>cenosphere</b> formation, fragmentation behaviour and its contribution to ash and particulate matter formation during solid fuels combustion. The specific objectives are to 1) investigate the possible formation mechanisms of ash cenospheres via characterizing the properties of ash cenospheres collected from a coal-fired power station; 2) reveal the fundamental formation mechanism of ash cenospheres during solid fuels combustion using pyrite as a model fuel; and 3) demonstrate the phenomenon of ash <b>cenosphere</b> fragmentation during solid fuel combustion and provide direct experimental evidence on its role in ash and particulate matter formation during solid fuels combustion. To accomplish these objectives, ash <b>cenosphere</b> samples were collected from a coal-fired power station. A systematic experimental program was also designed and conducted in a DTF system under various conditions using pyrite as a model fuel. The ash <b>cenosphere</b> samples and ash samples collected from laboratory experiments (including ashes collected in the cyclone and PM 10 collected by a DLPT) were characterized by various analytical methods. The specific objectives have been successfully achieved in this PhD study. Firstly, the characterization of narrow size-fractioned ash cenospheres collected from a coal-fired power station indicates that SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio decreases with the increase of ash <b>cenosphere</b> size, accompanied with an increase in the sum of TiO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 contents. The gas products locked inside various ash <b>cenosphere</b> size fractions are dominantly CO 2 and some N 2. The average gas pressure decreases from 0. 227 atm to 0. 172 atm (NTP) as particle size increases from 63 − 75 μm to 150 − 250 μm. Thermomechanical analysis further shows that ash cenospheres of different size fractions do not melt at 1600 °C, suggesting that these ash cenospheres from coal-fired power station are impossible to be formed at temperatures < 1600 °C. Ash chemistry of individual cenospheres indicates that the optimum particle temperature for <b>cenosphere</b> formation is ~ 1640 – 1800 °C. Under these conditions, molten ash droplets can be formed and grow by trapping a certain amount of gas generated within the ash droplets. The growth of <b>cenosphere</b> precursors is governed by the wide range of viscosity of molten <b>cenosphere</b> precursors together with the force of surface tension, which is demonstrated to be inversely proportional to the viscosity of molten droplets, producing ash cenospheres with various wall thicknesses. The data also appear to suggest that apart form Fe 2 O 3, TiO 2 {{may play a role in}} the formation of ash cenospheres during pulverized coal combustion. Secondly, a systematic experimental program was designed to fundamentally investigate the formation mechanism of ash <b>cenosphere</b> during solid fuels combustion in a drop-tube furnace (gas temperature: 530 – 1100 C; residence time: 1. 1 s) using pulverized pyrite (38 - 45 μm) as a model fuel. The results show that the formation of ash <b>cenosphere</b> commences at a furnace temperature as low as 580 °C. At furnace temperatures  600 C, ash products of pyrite combustion consist of dominantly large ash cenospheres (up to 130 μm in diameter) with thin shells (1 − 3 μm) and ash <b>cenosphere</b> fragments of various sizes. An increase in furnace temperature leads to enhanced ash <b>cenosphere</b> fragmentation. The presence of O 2 is found to be essential to the formation of molten Fe-S-O droplets. The sulphur oxides gaseous products produced within the droplets inflate to form cenospheric precursors, followed by further oxidation and resolidification transforms these cenospheric Fe-S-O precursors into final ash cenospheres that also experience fragmentation and contain dominantly iron oxides. Thirdly, a set of experiments were also carried out to combust pulverised pyrite at 600 C in the drop-tube furnace system but at various residence times (0. 4, 0. 7, 0. 9 and 1. 1 s). Substantial amounts of PM 10 (dominantly PM 1 - 10 and also some PM 1) are produced during the combustion of pulverised pyrite. The PSDs of PM 10 have a bimodal distribution, i. e. a fine mode with a mode diameter of 0. 26 μm and a coarse mode with mode diameters from 4. 4 μm to 6. 8 μm. At 0. 4 s residence time, the production of ash cenospheres is limited. As the residence time increases, the formation of complete ash cenospheres and their fragments increases substantially, suggesting the enhanced fragmentation of ash cenospheres. As a result, there is a substantial increase in the yield of PM 10 at a longer residence time (e. g. 1. 1 s). Therefore, the results in this study provide direct experimental evidences to demonstrate the important role of ash <b>cenosphere</b> fragmentation in PM 10 formation. Overall, the present study provides original and new insights into the formation mechanism of ash cenospheres during solid fuels combustion using pulverized pyrite as a model fuel. As the first time in the field, it clarifies the role of ash <b>cenosphere</b> fragmentation and its significant contribution to particulate matter emission. The characteristics of ash cenospheres of various size fractions also provide essential insights into ash <b>cenosphere</b> formation during pulverized coal combustion. Most importantly, the research methodology taken in this PhD study, particularly the design of the systematic experimental program using pyrite as a model fuel provides a simple (but not simpler) solid fuel combustion system for investigating complicated thermochemical process of ash <b>cenosphere</b> formation. This approach makes it possible to thoroughly understand the fundamental formation mechanism of ash <b>cenosphere</b> during solid fuels combustion...|$|E

40|$|The work {{reports the}} {{preparation}} of fly ash <b>cenospheres</b> bearing polymer composites, using various polymer matrix materials namely, low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, polystyrene and polymethylmethacrylate followed by evaluation of properties. The composites are synthesized by including about 18 % by weight fly ash <b>cenospheres,</b> into various polymer matrices using brabender facility in the temperature range 120 - 160 degrees C and at a mixing pressure of 50 MPa. Subsequently, they are cast into sheets through compression moulding. The test samples, made from the sheets, are characterized for physical as well as mechanical properties such as density, hardness, compression strength, impact response, wear and friction. The investigation reveals that the addition of fly ash <b>cenospheres</b> to various polymer matrices results in reduction of density. Further, improvements in the slide wear resistance and decrease in the co-efficient of friction values are noticed. As for interpreting the slide wear data, recourse to examination under scanning electron microscope is made in this paper. As regards the mechanical properties, hardness increases while the compression strength and impact energy decreases with inclusion of <b>cenospheres</b> in all the four types of samples investigated...|$|R
