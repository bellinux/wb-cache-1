In the 1930s, Sieverts Lödlampfabrik (maker of the original Svea 123) produced the Campus No. 3 stove.

Based on the energy flow of CCHP system, the capacity and operation of CCHP system are optimized by genetic algorithm (GA) so as to maximize the technical, economical and environmental benefits achieved by CCHP system in comparison to separation production system.
