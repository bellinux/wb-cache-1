30|$|The {{land use}} {{data of the}} SGDBE were {{exploited}} during the biomass productivity evaluation. The SGDBE holds information on dominant and secondary land use types of each <b>component</b> <b>STU</b> of the soil map polygons. For cropland productivity evaluation, only those STUs were considered which had cultivated land as primary or secondary land use type in the SGDBE.|$|E

The smart terminal unit (STU) is installed at each switchgear of the feeder, and STU has a directional over-current <b>component.</b> The adjacent <b>STUs</b> are connected each other by the optic fibre network, and ultimately they are all connected to the central station of FA. STU detects the local current {{and the status of}} breaker in real time, meanwhile exchanges the information with adjacent STUs. Through analyzing the information, STU can make a correct identification for a faulted section. Therefore, the faulted section can be isolated and power supply of non-faulted section can also be restored rapidly. Case analysis illustrates that the proposed fast protection and control scheme is valid and feasible...|$|R
