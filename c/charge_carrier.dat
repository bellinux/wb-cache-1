5|$|In {{the early}} 1700s, Francis Hauksbee and French chemist Charles François de Fay {{independently}} discovered {{what they believed}} were two kinds of frictional electricity—one generated from rubbing glass, the other from rubbing resin. From this, Du Fay theorized that electricity consists of two electrical fluids, vitreous and resinous, that are separated by friction, and that neutralize each other when combined. American scientist Ebenezer Kinnersley later also independently reached the same conclusion. A decade later Benjamin Franklin proposed that electricity was not from different types of electrical fluid, but a single electrical fluid showing an excess (+) or deficit (-). He gave them the modern charge nomenclature {{of positive and negative}} respectively. Franklin thought of the <b>charge</b> <b>carrier</b> as being positive, but he did not correctly identify which situation was a surplus of the <b>charge</b> <b>carrier,</b> and which situation was a deficit.|$|E
25|$|Magneto-optic {{generalized}} ellipsometry (MOGE) is {{an advanced}} infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry technique for studying free <b>charge</b> <b>carrier</b> properties in conducting samples. By applying an {{external magnetic field}} {{it is possible to}} determine independently the density, the optical mobility parameter and the effective mass parameter of free charge carriers. Without the magnetic field only two out of the three free <b>charge</b> <b>carrier</b> parameters can be extracted independently.|$|E
25|$|Solar cell {{efficiency}} may {{be broken}} down into reflectance efficiency, thermodynamic efficiency, <b>charge</b> <b>carrier</b> separation efficiency and conductive efficiency. The overall efficiency is the product of these individual metrics.|$|E
40|$|Some {{peculiar}} positive <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> are thermally {{generated in}} fused silica above 500 C. These <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> {{appear to be}} positive holes, chemically O-states, probably arising from dissociation of peroxy defects. The <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> {{give rise to a}} pronounced positive surface charge which disappears upon cooling but can be quenched by rapid quenching from about 800 C. Reheating to 200 C remobilizes these <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> and causes them to anneal below 400 C. The generation of positive holes <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> may be important to understand failure mechanisms of SiO 2 insulators...|$|R
50|$|The {{localized}} states between EFn and EFp {{are known}} as ‘photoactive centers.’ The <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> remain in these states {{for a long time}} until they recombine with an oppositely <b>charged</b> <b>carrier.</b> The states outside the EFn - EFp energy, however, relax their <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> to the nearest extended states.|$|R
30|$|Electrons are {{the main}} <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> in the glassy phase. The {{increase}} of the NPs concentration brings additional free <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> or increases mobility of carriers.|$|R
25|$|A bipolar {{junction}} transistor (bipolar transistor or BJT) {{is a type of}} transistor that uses both electron and hole charge carriers. In contrast, unipolar transistors, such as field-effect transistors, only use one kind of <b>charge</b> <b>carrier.</b> For their operation, BJTs use two junctions between two semiconductor types, n-type and p-type.|$|E
25|$|Transport of ions in the {{electrolyte}} can {{be adjusted}} by tuning the pH value in a dilute ionic solution, or by introducing an external electrical potential to change the surface charge density of the wall. As an analogy to semiconductor devices, the mechanism to control <b>charge</b> <b>carrier</b> transport in electronic devices {{was established in the}} area of nanofluidics. In nanofluidics, the active control of ion transport is realized using nano-scale channels or pores.|$|E
25|$|This {{effect is}} {{sometimes}} exploited by particle detectors to detect radiation. A single particle of radiation, with thousands or millions of electron volts of energy, generates many <b>charge</b> <b>carrier</b> pairs, as its energy is {{deposited in the}} semiconductor material. If the depletion layer {{is large enough to}} catch the whole shower or to stop a heavy particle, a fairly accurate measurement of the particle's energy can be made, simply by measuring the charge conducted and without the complexity of a magnetic spectrometer, etc.|$|E
30|$|It {{was found}} that {{behavior}} of <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> in the SSDSSC structure obeys mainly the power-law dependence with α[*]=[*] 2 that corresponds to the first-order (monomolecular) recombination with p[*]>>[*]n, that means that concentration of the injected minority <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> is not enough in the structure. In {{the case of the}} DSSC structure, the <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> behavior follows the cubic dependence with α[*]=[*] 3. In both structures based on hyperbranched CdS nanobrushes, the interface of CdS nanowires with ZnPc- 4 R plays the main role in formation of photo-generated <b>charge</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of laser-induced excess <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> is investigated in MoSe, and MoSx powders by contactless time-resolved photoconductivity measurements. Remarkably long lifetimes of excess <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> are found. It is shown that platinization of the MO. %, and halogen {{treatment of the}} MO & powder dramatically shorten the lifetimes of excess <b>charge</b> <b>carriers.</b> The expetimen-tal results are discussed with respect to photocatalysis. 1...|$|R
5000|$|When an {{electric}} field is applied across the semiconductor material, the <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> attain a certain drift velocity [...] This combined effect of {{movement of the}} <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> constitutes a current known as [...] "drift current". Drift current density due to the <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> such as free electrons and holes is the current passing through a square centimeter area perpendicular to the direction of flow.|$|R
25|$|All {{semiconductors}} {{are subject}} to optical <b>charge</b> <b>carrier</b> generation. This is typically an undesired effect, so most semiconductors are packaged in light blocking material. Photodiodes are intended to sense light(photodetector), so they are packaged in materials that allow light to pass, and are usually PIN (the kind of diode most sensitive to light). A photodiode {{can be used in}} solar cells, in photometry, or in optical communications. Multiple photodiodes may be packaged in a single device, either as a linear array or as a two-dimensional array. These arrays {{should not be confused with}} charge-coupled devices.|$|E
25|$|Power {{capacitors}} can be {{used for}} a wide variety of applications, even where extremely non-sinusoidal voltages and pulsed currents are present. Both AC and DC capacitors are available. AC capacitors serve as damping or snubbing capacitors when connected in series with a resistor, and are also specified for the damping of undesirable voltage spikes caused by the so-called <b>charge</b> <b>carrier</b> storage effect during switching of power semiconductors. In addition, AC capacitors are used in low-detuned or close-tuned filter circuits for filtering or absorbing harmonics. As pulse discharge capacitors, they are useful in applications with reversing voltages, such as in magnetizing equipment.|$|E
25|$|Single carrier {{devices are}} {{typically}} {{used to study}} the kinetics and charge transport mechanisms of an organic material and can be useful when trying to study energy transfer processes. As current through the device is composed of only one type of <b>charge</b> <b>carrier,</b> either electrons or holes, recombination does not occur and no light is emitted. For example, electron only devices {{can be obtained by}} replacing ITO with a lower work function metal which increases the energy barrier of hole injection. Similarly, hole only devices can be made by using a cathode made solely of aluminium, resulting in an energy barrier too large for efficient electron injection.|$|E
50|$|In {{metallic}} solids, {{electric charge}} flows {{by means of}} electrons, from lower to higher electrical potential. In other media, any stream of charged objects (ions, for example) may constitute an electric current. To provide a definition of current independent {{of the type of}} <b>charge</b> <b>carriers,</b> conventional current is defined as moving {{in the same direction as}} the positive charge flow. So, in metals where the <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> (electrons) are negative, conventional current is in the opposite direction as the electrons. In conductors where the <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> are positive, conventional current is in the same direction as the <b>charge</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|If all <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> {{have the}} same charge q (for {{electrons}} q = −e, the electron charge) the charge density can be expressed through the number of <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> per unit volume, n(r), by ...|$|R
50|$|It can be {{seen that}} in some conductors, such as ionic {{solutions}} and plasmas, there are both positive and negative <b>charge</b> <b>carriers,</b> so an electric current in them consists of the two polarities of carrier moving in opposite directions. In other conductors, such as metals, there are only <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> of one polarity, so an electric current in them just consists of <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> moving in one direction.|$|R
25|$|Charge flow in a BJT {{is due to}} {{diffusion}} of charge carriers across a junction between two regions of different charge concentrations. The regions of a BJT are called emitter, collector, and base. A discrete transistor has three leads for connection to these regions. Typically, the emitter region is heavily doped {{compared to the other}} two layers, whereas the majority <b>charge</b> <b>carrier</b> concentrations in base and collector layers are about the same. By design, most of the BJT collector current is due to the flow of charges injected from a high-concentration emitter into the base where they are minority carriers that diffuse toward the collector, and so BJTs are classified as minority-carrier devices.|$|E
25|$|In 1785, N. Rouland {{constructed}} a silk-belted machine that rubbed two grounded tubes covered with hare fur. Edward Nairne developed an electrostatic generator for medical purposes in 1787 {{that had the}} ability to generate either positive or negative electricity, the first of these being collected from the prime conductor carrying the collecting points and the second from another prime conductor carrying the friction pad. The Winter machine possessed higher efficiency than earlier friction machines. In the 1830s, Georg Ohm possessed a machine similar to the Van Marum machine for his research (which is now at the Deutsches Museum, Munich, Germany). In 1840, the Woodward machine was developed by improving the Ramsden machine, placing the prime conductor above the disk(s). Also in 1840, the Armstrong hydroelectric machine was developed, using steam as a <b>charge</b> <b>carrier.</b>|$|E
25|$|The energy {{spectrum}} of an electron {{moving in a}} periodical potential of rigid crystal lattice consists of allowed and forbidden bands and {{is known as the}} Bloch spectrum. An electron with energy inside an allowed band moves as a free electron but has an effective mass that differs from the electron mass in vacuum. However, a crystal lattice is deformable and displacements of atoms (ions) from their equilibrium positions are described in terms of phonons. Electrons interact with these displacements, and this interaction is known as electron-phonon coupling. One of possible scenarios was proposed in the seminal 1933 paper by Lev Landau, which includes the production of a lattice defect such as an F-center and a trapping of the electron by this defect. A different scenario was proposed by Solomon Pekar that envisions dressing the electron with lattice deformation (a cloud of virtual phonons). Such an electron with the accompanying deformation moves freely across the crystal, but with increased effective mass. Pekar coined for this <b>charge</b> <b>carrier</b> the term polaron.|$|E
50|$|Physically, the {{magnitude}} and sign of the Seebeck coefficient can be approximately understood as being given by the entropy per unit charge carried by electrical currents in the material. It may be positive or negative. In conductors that can {{be understood in terms}} of independently moving, nearly-free <b>charge</b> <b>carriers,</b> the Seebeck coefficient is negative for negatively <b>charged</b> <b>carriers</b> (such as electrons), and positive for positively <b>charged</b> <b>carriers</b> (such as electron holes).|$|R

25|$|Titanium dioxide, {{particularly}} in the anatase form, exhibits photocatalytic activity under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. This photoactivity is reportedly most pronounced at the {001} planes of anatase, although the {101} planes are thermodynamically more stable and thus more prominent in most synthesised and natural anatase, as evident by the often observed tetragonal dipyramidal growth habit. Interfaces between rutile and anatase are further considered to improve photocatalytic activity by facilitating <b>charge</b> <b>carrier</b> separation and as a result, biphasic titanium dioxide is often considered to possess enhanced functionality as a photocatalyst.

It can also oxidize oxygen or organic materials directly. Hence, in addition to its use as a pigment, titanium dioxide can be added to paints, cements, windows, tiles, or other products for its sterilizing, deodorizing and anti-fouling properties and is used as a hydrolysis catalyst. It is also used in dye-sensitized solar cells, which are a type of chemical solar cell (also known as a Graetzel cell).|$|E

Space charge polarization, as a parasitic effect due to the blocking of <b>charge</b> <b>carriers</b> {{in the vicinity of}} electrode, can mask dielectric response of the sample at low frequencies.
