After the crash, Paulo becomes suspicious Nikki is just using {{him to get the}} diamonds. The first thing she asks him after the crash is the whereabouts of the diamonds, and avoids answering Paulo when he asks if they would still be together if she did not need him to help find the diamonds. Paulo does what Nikki tells him to because of his fear of losing her, which results in their deaths.|$|E

They tend to be more politically liberal on both domestic and international issues. They want their countries to do more to alleviate global suffering.|$|E

Human faeces are very dangerous; they contain over 100 bacteria, protozoans and viruses that, without a specialised recycling process, {{pose a threat to}} both animals and human beings. Only boiled or chemically treated water is accepted for drinking. Decent changes have appeared in recent years–management bodies <b>care</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> human waste disposal.

25|$|The England–Germany {{football}} rivalry {{is considered}} to be mainly an English phenomenon—in the run-up to any competition match between the two teams, many UK newspapers will print articles detailing results of previous encounters, such as those in 1966 and 1990. Football fans in England often consider Germany to be their main sporting rivals and <b>care</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> this rivalry than those with other nations, such as Argentina or Scotland. Most German fans consider the Netherlands or Italy to be their traditional footballing rivals, and as such, usually the rivalry is not taken quite as seriously there as it is in England.|$|E
25|$|As {{far back}} as the 1960s, the footballing rivalry between England and Germany has been {{considered}} mainly an English phenomenon; this has been observed by several commentators of both English and German origin. In June 2009, British comedian Stephen Fry stated on the BBC show QI that, unlike the English, German football fans do not care about their team's loss at the 1966 World Cup final and may not even remember that they had made it that far. Instead, German fans consider their rivalry with the Netherlands to be their traditional footballing rivalry and <b>care</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the matches against them, such as the 1974 FIFA World Cup final.|$|E

25|$|During spring 2012, Jobbik {{representative}} in Hungarian parliament Zsolt Baráth caused an outrage by commemorating 1882 blood libel against the Jews in Parliament. The Tiszaeszlár blood libel, found later to be unrelated to Jews, {{was known as}} first major anti-Jewish event in modern Hungary, predating the Holocaust. The speech of Baráth caused controversy among Jobbik MPs: some - however finding it inappropriate and uncalled for - stated that in a matured democracy {{there should not be}} taboo topics, while leaders of the Jobbik Parliamentary Group told the media that they had evaluated the speech and learnt the lesson that they should <b>care</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> what their MPs are talking. After the incident Baráth was not re-elected and is not an MP of Jobbik anymore.|$|E

500|$|Mikoyan spearheaded {{a project}} to produce a home cookbook, which would {{encourage}} {{a return to the}} domestic kitchen. The result, The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food ( [...] , Kniga o vkusnoi i zdorovoi pishche), was published in 1939, and the 1952 edition sold 2.5 million copies. Mikoyan helped initiate the production of ice cream in the USSR and kept the quality of ice cream under his own personal control until he was dismissed. Stalin made a joke about this, stating, [...] "You, Anastas, <b>care</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> ice cream, than about communism." [...] Mikoyan also contributed to the development of meat production in the USSR (particularly, the so-called Mikoyan cutlet), and one of the Soviet-era sausage factories was named after him.|$|E
500|$|The book's {{environmental}} {{focus was}} also criticized by some. Christopher Orlet of The American Spectator wrote {{that it is}} [...] "a prime example of the wrongheaded, extremist views of the Greens". Braile agrees that the book could be [...] "an environmentalist's nightmare, possibly fueling the cheap shots taken at the green movement ... by critics who say environmentalists <b>care</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> nature than people". Environmentalist Alex Steffen found the book presents nothing new, but that using the sudden and clean disappearance of humans provides a unique framework, although extremely unlikely and insensitive. Two critics who call the book a [...] "Jeremiad" [...] ultimately gave it a positive review. The Guardian says [...] "we learn {{during the course of}} this book, to feel good about the disappearance of humanity from the Earth".|$|E
500|$|Miller {{considered}} Uru a major {{departure from}} Myst and Riven in that Cyan {{wanted to create}} a persistent world, where actions occurred while the player was not online. Miller did not consider the game a true massively multiplayer online game, saying [...] "there is not leveling and skills and monsters and experience in any artificial sense. The 'leveling' is finding and exploring and owning new Ages that are released regularly; the experience is what you really learn while exploring that will help you later—not points on a scale." [...] Miller considered there to be two benefits to such a system: firstly that players would <b>care</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> being part of the story, and secondly that even new players could make discoveries and be part of the community. The game was designed as more of a spin-off than a sequel to previous Myst games, due to the merging of items from the contemporary (traffic cones and T-shirts) to the fantastic (books that transport the user to new worlds).|$|E

Claude is hung up on a cross over Sheila and Berger." [...] The tribe runs out to the audience with fliers inviting them to a Be-In. [...] Berger, Woof and another tribe member pay satiric tribute to the American flag as they fold it ("Don't Put it Down").

500|$|Amy Poehler {{said the}} first season {{struggled}} {{in part due to}} extremely high expectations from comparisons to The Office. Parks and Recreation staff also felt {{part of the reason for}} the improvement was that the characters have become better developed, and viewers have come to like and <b>care</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> them. Likewise, Michael Schur believed much of the early criticism stemmed from the fact that audiences were not yet familiar with the characters, and he believed viewers liked the second season better because they had gotten to know the characters better as the series progressed. Commentators said the supporting cast was now working with better material and that Poehler's character had improved and become less over-the-top and more human than in the first season, and more distinct from Michael Scott. Several reviewers praised the decision to drop season one subplots that risked becoming stale, like whether Andy and Ann would keep dating, and Leslie's long-standing crush on Mark. Others complimented the decision to fill in the pit during the second season, which they said freed the show up for more stories and better scripts. Despite the vast change in critical reception, Parks and Recreation staff said they felt only a few minor changes were made to the show itself. Michael Schur said, [...] "I don't think magical fairy dust was sprinkled over the show. I just think we're getting better at it." [...] NBC officials compared the late rush of critical acclaim for Parks and Recreation to that of The Office, which received mixed reviews during its first season before most critics agreed it found its rhythm in the second season.|$|E
