5|$|Cirrus clouds, like <b>cirrostratus</b> clouds, {{can produce}} several optical effects, such as halos {{around the sun}} and moon. Halos are caused by {{interaction}} of the light with hexagonal ice crystals present in the clouds, which, depending on their shape and orientation, {{can result in a}} wide variety of white and colored rings, arcs and spots in the sky. Common halo varieties are the 22° halo, sun dogs, the circumzenithal arc and the circumhorizontal arc (also known as fire rainbows). Halos produced by cirrus clouds tend to be more pronounced and colorful than those caused by <b>cirrostratus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cirrus forms from {{tropical}} cyclones, and {{is commonly}} seen fanning {{out from the}} eyewalls of hurricanes. A large shield of cirrus and <b>cirrostratus</b> typically accompanies the high altitude outflow of hurricanes or typhoons, and these can make the underlying rain bands—and sometimes even the eye—difficult to detect in satellite photographs.|$|E
5|$|After making landfall, Nida {{weakened}} {{and then}} turned more northward and slowed down. Re-entering the warmer waters of the Western Pacific Ocean, Nida's winds restrengthened to 150 mph (250km/h). During the night of May 18, the typhoon began to weaken. Infrared satellite imagery showed the eye being obscured by high <b>cirrostratus</b> clouds, indicative of the weakening typhoon. The eyewall became significantly disorganized as Nida continued to recurve to the northeast.|$|E
5|$|Jet stream-powered cirrus {{can grow}} {{long enough to}} stretch across continents while {{remaining}} only a few kilometers deep. When visible light interacts with the ice crystals in cirrus cloud, it produces optical phenomena such as sun dogs and halos. Cirrus is known to raise {{the temperature of the}} air beneath the main cloud layer by an average of 10°C (18°F). When the individual filaments become so extensive that they are virtually indistinguishable from one another, they form a sheet of high cloud called <b>cirrostratus.</b> Convection at high altitudes can produce another high-based genus called cirrocumulus, a pattern of small cloud tufts that contain droplets of supercooled water.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{pressure}} tendency, {{the condition of}} the sky {{is one of the more}} important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future. At night, high thin <b>cirrostratus</b> clouds can lead to halos around the moon, which indicates an approach of a warm front and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation. The approach of a line of thunderstorms could indicate the approach of a cold front. Cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future. A bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone. The use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries.|$|E
5|$|The main ways {{water vapor}} {{is added to}} the air are: wind {{convergence}} into areas of upward motion, precipitation or virga falling from above, daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land, transpiration from plants, cool or dry air moving over warmer water, and lifting air over mountains. Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. Elevated portions of weather fronts (which are three-dimensional in nature) force broad areas of upward motion within the Earth's atmosphere which form clouds decks such as altostratus or <b>cirrostratus.</b> Stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass. It can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions.|$|E
5|$|Random, {{isolated}} cirrus do {{not have}} any particular significance. A large number of cirrus clouds can be a sign of an approaching frontal system or upper air disturbance. This signals a change in weather in the near future, which usually becomes stormier. If the cloud is a cirrus castellanus, there might be instability at the high altitude level. When the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the cirrus radiatus variety or cirrus fibratus species, this usually indicates an approaching weather front. If it is a warm front, the cirrus clouds spread out into <b>cirrostratus,</b> which then thicken and lower into altocumulus and altostratus. The next set of clouds are the rain-bearing nimbostratus clouds. When cirrus clouds precede a cold front, squall line or multicellular thunderstorm, it is because they are blown off the anvil, and the next to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cirrostratus</b> {{is a thin}} non-convective {{stratiform}} ice crystal veil {{that typically}} gives rise to halos caused by refraction of the sun's rays. The sun and moon are visible in clear outline.Cirrostratus often thickens into altostratus ahead of a warm front or low-pressure area.|$|E
500|$|There {{are three}} main genera {{in the family}} of high clouds: cirrus, cirrocumulus, and <b>cirrostratus.</b> <b>Cirrostratus</b> clouds {{commonly}} produce halos because they are composed almost entirely of ice crystals. Cirrocumulus and <b>cirrostratus</b> are sometimes informally referred to as [...] "cirriform clouds" [...] because of their frequent association with cirrus. They are given the prefix [...] "cirro-", but this refers more to their altitude range than their physical structure. Cirrocumulus in its pure form is actually a high cumuliform genus, and <b>cirrostratus</b> is stratiform, like altostratus and lower based sheet clouds.|$|E
500|$|<b>Cirrostratus</b> clouds {{can appear}} as a milky sheen in the sky or as a {{striated}} sheet. They are sometimes similar to altostratus and are distinguishable from the latter because the sun or moon is always clearly visible through transparent <b>cirrostratus,</b> in contrast to altostratus which tends to be opaque or translucent. <b>Cirrostratus</b> come in two species, fibratus and nebulosus. The ice crystals in these clouds vary depending upon the height in the cloud. Towards the bottom, at temperatures of around [...] to , the crystals tend to be long, solid, hexagonal columns. Towards {{the top of the}} cloud, at temperatures of around [...] to , the predominant crystal types are thick, hexagonal plates and short, solid, hexagonal columns. These clouds commonly produce halos, and sometimes the halo is the only indication that such clouds are present. They are formed by warm, moist air being lifted slowly to a very high altitude. When a warm front approaches, <b>cirrostratus</b> clouds become thicker and descend forming altostratus clouds, and rain usually begins 12 to 24 hours later.|$|E
500|$|Cirrus {{clouds are}} one of three {{different}} genera of high-étage (high-level) clouds. High-étage clouds form at [...] and above in temperate regions. The other two genera, cirrocumulus and <b>cirrostratus,</b> are also high clouds.|$|E
500|$|The sun dogs or parhelia, in the {{painting}} erroneously pinned to the misinterpreted arcs of the circumscribed halo, are rather frequent optical phenomena which appear when sunlight is refracted by hexagonal ice crystals forming cirrus or <b>cirrostratus</b> clouds. [...] When the sun is still low, they are located on the 22° halo, {{the way they are}} most commonly observed, and as the sun ascends they move laterally away from the 22° halo. [...] At rare occasions, they can actually reach the circumscribed halo. [...] As depicted in {{the painting}}, the sun dogs are located midway between the 22° halo and the circumscribed halo, and, assuming they are correctly rendered, the sun should have been located at about 35-40° above the horizon (as in the simulation above).|$|E
500|$|There {{has been}} {{historical}} controversy over whether {{features on the}} Moon's surface change over time. Today, many of these claims {{are thought to be}} illusory, resulting from observation under different lighting conditions, poor astronomical seeing, or inadequate drawings. However, outgassing does occasionally occur, and could be responsible for a minor percentage of the reported lunar transient phenomena. Recently, {{it has been suggested that}} a roughly [...] diameter region of the lunar surface was modified by a gas release event about a million years ago. The Moon's appearance, like that of the Sun, can be affected by Earth's atmosphere: common effects are a 22° halo ring formed when the Moon's light is refracted through the ice crystals of high <b>cirrostratus</b> cloud, and smaller coronal rings when the Moon is seen through thin clouds.|$|E
500|$|Cumulus {{clouds are}} a genus of free-convective low-étage cloud {{along with the}} related limited-convective {{cumuliform}} or stratocumuliform cloud stratocumulus. These clouds form from ground level to [...] at all latitudes. Stratus clouds are also low-étage. In the middle étage are the alto clouds, which consist of the limiited-convective cumuliform or stratocumuliform cloud altocumulus and the stratiform cloud altostratus. Middle-étage clouds form from [...] to [...] in polar areas, [...] in temperate areas, and [...] in tropical areas. The high-étage clouds are all cirriform, one of which, cirrocumulus, is also cumuliform of limited convection or stratocumuliform. The other clouds in this étage are cirrus and <b>cirrostratus.</b> High-étage clouds form [...] in high latitudes, [...] in temperate latitudes, and [...] in low, tropical latitudes. Cumulonimbus clouds, like cumulus congestus, extend vertically rather than remaining confined to one étage.|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{stratiform}} group, high-level <b>cirrostratus</b> comprises two species. [...] <b>Cirrostratus</b> nebulosus has {{a rather}} diffuse appearance lacking in structural detail. [...] <b>Cirrostratus</b> fibratus is a species made of semi-merged filaments that are transitional {{to or from}} cirrus. Mid-level altostratus and multi-level nimbostratus always have a flat or diffuse appearance and are therefore not subdivided into species. Low stratus is of the species nebulosus except when broken up into ragged sheets of stratus fractus (see below).|$|E
2500|$|Non-convective {{stratiform}} clouds {{appear in}} stable airmass conditions and, in general, have flat sheet-like structures that can form at any altitude in the troposphere. [...] Very low stratiform cloud results when advection fog is lifted above surface level during breezy conditions. [...] The stratiform group is divided by altitude range into the genera <b>cirrostratus</b> (high-level), altostratus (mid-level), stratus (low-level), and nimbostratus (multi-level).|$|E
2500|$|These {{are mostly}} fibrous wisps of {{delicate}} white cirriform ice crystal cloud that show up clearly {{against the blue}} sky. Cirrus are generally non-convective except castellanus and floccus subtypes which show limited convection. They often form along a high altitude jetstream {{and at the very}} leading edge of a frontal or low-pressure disturbance where they may merge into <b>cirrostratus.</b> [...] These high clouds do not produce precipitation.|$|E
2500|$|This is a {{pure white}} high stratocumuliform layer of limited convection. [...] It is {{composed}} of ice crystals or supercooled water droplets appearing as small unshaded round masses or flakes in groups or lines with ripples like sand on a beach. Cirrocumulus occasionally forms alongside cirrus and may be accompanied or replaced by <b>cirrostratus</b> clouds at the very leading edge of an active weather system.|$|E
2500|$|High clouds form at altitudes of [...] in {{the polar}} regions, [...] in the {{temperate}} regions and [...] in the tropics. [...] All cirriform clouds {{are classified as}} high and thus constitute a single genus cirrus (Ci). Stratocumuliform and stratiform clouds in the high altitude range carry the prefix cirro-, yielding the respective genus names cirrocumulus (Cc) and <b>cirrostratus</b> (Cs). [...] When limited-resolution satellite images of high clouds are analysed without supporting data from direct human observations, it becomes impossible to distinguish between individual forms or genus types, which are then collectively identified as high-type (or informally as cirrus-type even though not all high clouds are of the cirrus form or genus).|$|E
2500|$|The genitus and mutatus {{categories}} {{have been}} {{expanded to include}} certain types that do not originate from pre-existing clouds. The term flammagenitus (Latin for 'fire-made') applies to cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus that are formed by large scale fires or volcanic eruptions. Smaller low-level [...] "pyrocumulus" [...] or [...] "fumulus" [...] clouds formed by contained industrial activity are now classified as cumulus homogenitus (Latin for 'man-made'). Contrails formed from the exhaust of aircraft flying in the upper level of the troposphere can persist and spread into formations resembling any of the high cloud genus-types and are now officially designated as cirrus, <b>cirrostratus,</b> or cirrocumulus homogenitus. If a homogenitus cloud of one genus changes to another genus type, it is then termed a homomutatus cloud. Stratus cataractagenitus (Latin for 'cataract-made') are generated by the spray from waterfalls. [...] Silvagenitus (Latin for 'forest-made') is a stratus cloud that forms as water vapor {{is added to the}} air above a forest canopy.|$|E
60|$|I {{would draw}} especial attention, {{both here and}} in all other works of Turner, to the {{beautiful}} use of the low horizontal bars or fields of cloud, (<b>cirrostratus,)</b> which associate themselves so frequently--more especially before storms--with the true cumulus, floating on its flanks, or capping it, {{as if it were}} a mountain, and seldom mingling with its substance, unless in the very formation of rain. They supply us with one of those beautiful instances of natural composition, by which the artist is superseded and excelled--for, by the occurrence of these horizontal flakes, the rolling form of the cumulus is both opposed in its principal lines, and gifted with an apparent solidity and vastness, which no other expedient could have exhibited, and which far exceed in awfulness the impression of the noblest mountains of the earth. I have seen in the evening light of Italy, the Alps themselves out-towered by ranges of these mighty clouds, alternately white in the starlight, and inhabited by fire.|$|E
60|$|At the 216th page we {{have another}} and a new case, in which clouds in perfect repose, {{unaffected}} by wind, or any influence but that of their own elastic force, boil, rise, and melt in the heaven with more approach to globular form than under any other circumstances is possible. I name this vignette, {{not only because it}} is most remarkable for the buoyancy and elasticity of inward energy, indicated through the most ponderous forms, and affords us a beautiful instance of the junction of the <b>cirrostratus</b> with the cumulus, of which we have just been speaking (§ 19,) but because it is a characteristic example of Turner's use of one of the facts of nature not hitherto noticed, that the edge of a partially transparent body is often darker than its central surface, because at the edge the light penetrates and passes through, which from the centre is reflected to the eye. The sharp, cutting edge of a wave, if not broken into foam, frequently appears for an instant almost black; and the outlines of these massy clouds, where their projecting forms rise in relief against the light of their bodies, are almost always marked clearly and firmly by very dark edges. Hence we have frequently, if not constantly, multitudinous forms indicated only by outline, giving character and solidity to the great masses of light, without taking away from their breadth. And Turner avails himself of these boldly and constantly,--outlining forms with the brush of which no other indication is given. All the grace and solidity of the white cloud on the right-hand side of the vignette before us, depends upon such outlines.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Cirrostratus</b> {{fibratus}} {{is a type}} of <b>cirrostratus</b> cloud. The name <b>cirrostratus</b> fibratus {{is derived}} from Latin, meaning [...] "fibrous". <b>Cirrostratus</b> fibratus is one of the two most common forms that <b>cirrostratus</b> often takes, with the other being <b>cirrostratus</b> nebulosus. They are formed from strong, continuous winds blowing at high altitudes, and they often cover {{a large portion of the}} sky. <b>Cirrostratus</b> fibratus may often develop from either cirrus fibratus or cirrus spissatus cloud.

On the approach of a frontal system, the <b>cirrostratus</b> often begins as nebulosus and turns to fibratus. If the <b>cirrostratus</b> begins as fragmented fibratus it often means the front is weak. <b>Cirrostratus</b> is usually located above 5.5 km (18,000 ft). Its presence indicates a large amount of moisture in the upper atmosphere.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cirrostratus</b> {{nebulosus}} is {{a species}} of high-level <b>cirrostratus</b> cloud.

The nebulosus species is featureless and uniform, while the fibratus species has a fibrous appearance. <b>Cirrostratus</b> nebulosus are formed by gently rising air. The cloud is often hard to see unless the sun shines through it at the correct angle, forming a halo. While usually very light, the cloud may also be very dense, and the exact appearance of the cloud can vary from one formation to another. In the winter, precipitation often follows behind these clouds; however, they are not a precipitation-producing cloud.|$|E

If the <b>cirrostratus</b> is broken fibratus it can mean that the front is weak and that stratus rather than nimbostratus will be the precipitating cloud (meaning drizzle or snow grains instead of moderate rain or snow). Cumulus humilis or stratocumulus clouds are often found below <b>cirrostratus</b> formations, due to the stable air associated with <b>cirrostratus</b> creating an inversion and restricting convection, causing cumuliform clouds to become flattened.
