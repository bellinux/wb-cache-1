The turn-on time we get from the simulation is the same as that from experiments under the valve’s actual operating conditions, in other words, the simulation results are correct, so we can identify the valve flow and get the internal pressure data which provides a reliable basis for the design of the key structural dimensions...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} was undertaken at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory {{in connection with}} a general research on fuel-injection for aircraft. The purpose of the {{investigation was}} to determine the factors controlling the reproducibility of spray penetration and secondary discharges after cut-off. The development of single sprays from automatic injection valves was recorded by means of special high-speed photographic apparatus capable of taking 25 consecutive pictures of the moving spray at a rate of 4, 000 per second. The effect of two types of injection valves, injection-valve tube length, initial pressure in the injection-valve tube, speed of the injection control mechanism, and time of spray cut-off, on the reproducibility of spray penetration, and on secondary discharges were investigated. It was found that neither type of injection valve materially affected spray reproducibility. The initial pressure in the injection-valve tube controlled the reproducibility of spray penetrations. An increase in the initial pressure or in the length of the injection-valve tube slightly increased the spray penetration within the limits of this investigation. The speed of the injection-control mechanism did not affect the penetration. Analysis of the results indicates that secondary discharges were caused in this apparatus by pressure waves initiated by the rapid opening of the <b>cut-off</b> <b>valve.</b> The secondary discharges were eliminated in this investigation by increasing the length of the injection-valve tube.

40|$|Railroad cars in coal {{service in}} the northeastern United States are often shopped for wheel defects such as slid flat, built up tread and spalling. Previous work found that these defects {{can be caused by}} wheel sliding after air {{pressure}} leaks through defective service and emergency brake <b>valve</b> <b>portions</b> into the brake cylinder. Another important factor in the creation of wheel defects from wheel sliding is the car’s empty braking ratio. If a car is excessively braked when empty, or has lost weight, there will be a greater chance for wheel sliding and damage.

40|$|Objective: Epicardial {{adipose tissue}} (EAT) is {{associated}} with the presence, severity and extent of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) in addition to subclinical atherosclerosis. We investigated if EAT thickness is related to acute myocardial infarction in patients with CAD. We also searched for the association between EAT thickness and objective coronary flow and myocardial perfusion parameters such as and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Frame count (TFC) and myocardial blush grade (MBG). Methods: Two-hundred consecutive patients with stable angina pectoris or acute coronary syndrome who were admitted to Ufuk University Faculty of Medicine, Dr Rıdvan Ege Hospital cardiology department were included in this observational, cross-sectional study. EAT thickness was evaluated by conventional transthoracic echocardiography. Coronary angiography was performed to determine the coronary involvement and perfusion. Results: Mean EAT thicknesses were 5. 4 ± 1. 9 mm, 6. 3 ± 1. 8 mm, and 8. 5 ± 1. 4 mm in the stable angina pectoris (SAP), unstable angina pectoris (USAP) and acute myocardial infarction groups, respectively (p 7 mm; mean TFC: 21. 6 ± 2. 2, 25. 3 ± 3. 3 and 35. 2 ± 7. 7; and MBG values: 2. 98 ± 0. 14, 2. 83 ± 0. 57 and 1. 7 ± 1. 16, respectively; both p< 0. 001).

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{investigation}} is to integrate an electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) brake model with efficient longitudinal train force algorithms based on the trajectory coordinate formulations. The ECP brake model, developed in this investigation consists of the train line (cable), locomotive automatic brake valve, air brake pipe, and ECP manifold. The train line, which covers {{the entire length of}} the train, allows the brake commands to be received by the car simultaneously. While pneumatic pressure is used to generate the braking forces, the brake pipe is no longer used to provide the brake level commands. Instead, the brake pipes are used to provide a continuous supply of compressed air stored in a reservoir mounted on each railcar. Using the ECP system to apply the brakes uniformly and instantaneously gives better train control, shortens the stopping distances, and leads to a lower risk of derailment. In this investigation, the fluid continuity and momentum equations are used to develop the governing air pressure flow equations. These partial differential equations are converted to a set of ordinary differential equations using the finite element method leading to an air brake force model that accounts for the effect of the air flow in long train pipes as well as the effect of leakage and branch pipe flows. The car brake forces are applied to the wheels using the ECP manifold located in each car. The ECP manifold used in this investigation has four valves: <b>cut-off</b> <b>valve,</b> vent valve, auxiliary valve, and emergency valve. The ECP manifold is connected to three main pneumatic components: the auxiliary reservoir, the emergency reservoir, and the brake cylinder. The reservoirs serve as the main storage of the pressurized air, while the brake cylinder and other mechanical components such as the rigging and the brake shoes transmit the brake force to the wheels. In this investigation, a mathematical model of the ECP manifold and its components is developed. The relationship between the main components of the ECP brake system and the train dynamics is discussed, and the final set of differential equations that integrates the ECP brake and train dynamics is presented. Different simulation scenarios are considered in this study in order to investigate the effect of the brake forces on the train longitudinal dynamics in the case of different braking scenarios. The performance of the developed ECP brake system is compared with the Association of American Railroads safety and operation standards, and with experimental results published in the literature...|$|R
