25|$|When {{dining out}} in a restaurant, the {{customers}} are guided to their seats by the host. The honored or eldest guest will usually be seated at the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> farthest from the entrance. In the home, the most important guest is also seated farthest away from the entrance. If there is a tokonoma, or alcove, in the room, the guest is seated in front of it. The host sits next to or closest to the entrance.|$|E
25|$|In southeastern Pennsylvania, Groundhog Lodges (Grundsow Lodges) {{celebrate}} the holiday with fersommlinge, social events in which food is served, speeches are made, {{and one or}} more g'spiel (plays or skits) are performed for entertainment. The Pennsylvania German dialect is the only language spoken at the event, and those who speak English pay a penalty, usually {{in the form of}} a nickel, dime, or quarter per word spoken, with the money put into a bowl in the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gui are grilled dishes, {{which most}} {{commonly}} have meat or fish {{as their primary}} ingredient, but may in some cases also comprise grilled vegetables or other vegetable ingredients. At traditional restaurants, meats are cooked at the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> over a charcoal grill, surrounded by various banchan and individual rice bowls. The cooked meat is then {{cut into small pieces}} and wrapped with fresh lettuce leaves, with rice, thinly sliced garlic, ssamjang (a mixture of gochujang and dwenjang), and other seasonings. The suffix gui is often omitted in the names of meat-based gui such as galbi, the name of which was originally galbi gui.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 2003, {{the casino}} had {{approximately}} eight blackjack <b>tables</b> on <b>the</b> lower level that featured celebrity impersonators as dealers. These impersonators, which included Joliet Jake from the Blues Brothers, Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, Cher, Shakira, Roy Orbison, Zac Brown, Shania Twain, Britney Spears, Buddy Holly, and others, alternated dealing cards and performing a song {{on a small}} stage in <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables.</b> <b>The</b> Dealertainers pit was discontinued as of September 8, 2014.|$|R
50|$|A Vietnamese feast has two courses: {{main course}} (món mặn - salty dish) and dessert (món ngọt - sweet dish). All dishes, except for {{individual}} bowls of rice, are enjoyed collectively. All main course dishes are served simultaneously {{rather than one}} after another. <b>The</b> major dish <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main course is placed in <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables,</b> usually big pots of soup or hot pot.|$|R
50|$|At <b>the</b> {{beginning}} <b>of</b> a round, {{each player}} is dealt four face down cards {{side by side}} and four face up cards facing <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> playing <b>table,</b> one {{in front of each}} face down card. The four parallel pairs of face up and face down cards form the player's four coops. A player may look at his own face down cards whenever he chooses, while his opponents may not look at them. <b>The</b> remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deck is placed face down in <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> playing <b>table</b> as <b>the</b> stock pile.|$|R
25|$|To {{remove any}} odor and {{excessive}} {{fat in the}} dish, any white fat adhering to the intestines should be meticulously cleaned out by rubbing them with wheat flour and salt and washing them several times. Since cooking the dish requires not only specialized cooking techniques {{and a great deal}} of labor to prepare, but also very fresh ingredients, gopchang jeongol is generally eaten at restaurants specializing in tripe dishes. The dish, which is seasoned with a hot and spicy red chili-based sauce, is served as a main entrée, accompanied with a bowl of steamed rice. It is often shared between several diners on the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and is also a popular anju when drinking alcoholic beverages such as soju in South Korea.|$|E
2500|$|The best-known Ethiopian cuisine {{consists}} {{of various types}} of thick meat stews, known as wat in Ethiopian culture, and vegetable side dishes served atop injera, a large sourdough flatbread made of teff flour. This is not eaten with utensils, but instead one uses the injera to scoop up the entrées and side dishes. Almost universally in Ethiopia, {{it is common to}} eat from the same dish in the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> with a group of people. It is also a common custom to feed others in your group with your own hands—a tradition referred to as [...] "gursha". Traditional Ethiopian cuisine employs no pork or shellfish of any kind, as they are forbidden in the Islamic, Jewish, and Ethiopian Orthodox faiths.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} give the strike teeth and to protect himself from harm, Verro {{became a member of}} a Mafia group in Corleone, the Fratuzzi (the Brothers). In a memoir written many years later, he {{described}} the initiation ritual he underwent in the spring of 1893: [...] " [...] was invited {{to take part in a}} secret meeting of the Fratuzzi. I entered a mysterious room where there were many men armed with guns sitting around a table. In the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> there was a skull drawn on a piece of paper and a knife. In order to be admitted to the Fratuzzi, [...] had to undergo an initiation consisting of some trials of loyalty and the pricking of the lower lip with the tip of the knife: the blood from the wound soaked the skull." ...|$|E

60|$|Jonathan Zane heard Betty's {{first words}} and {{disappeared}} into the magazine-room. He came out with a keg in his arms. With one blow of an axe he smashed {{in the top of the}} keg. In a twinkling a long black stream of the precious stuff was piling up in a little hill in the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> Then the corners of the table cloth were caught up, turned and twisted, and the bag of powder was thrown over Betty's shoulder.|$|E
60|$|While {{we spoke}} of the {{exquisite}} long-stemmed pink roses that filled a cut-glass punch-bowl in the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> I could see Mariposilla regarding quietly the array of silver encompassing her place. If I again doubted the propriety of what we had done, {{it was evident that}} but one method of escape remained--to make plain my every motion. Even as the idea seized me I perceived that the Spanish child had hit upon the plan herself, and was nervefully determined not to disgrace her friends.|$|E

6000|$|He {{stuck out}} his jaw, and remembered that {{he had planned to}} hide the [...] "letter from the duke" [...] in Istra's napkin that it might be the greater surprise. He sat down at their table. He tucked the letter into the napkin folds. He moved the vase of orchids nearer the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and the table nearer the open window giving on the green. He rebuked himself {{for not being able to}} think of {{something}} else to change. He forgot his clothes, and was happy.|$|E
60|$|The Major escorted Beth and Mr. Jones walked solemnly beside Myrtle, {{who still}} used crutches, but {{more as a}} matter of {{convenience}} than because they were necessary. At the end of a corridor a waiter threw open the door of a small but beautiful banquet room, where a round table, glistening with cut glass and silver, was set for six. In the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> was a handsome centerpiece decorated with vines of myrtle, while the entire room was filled with sprays of the dainty vines, alive with their pretty blue flowers.|$|E

Julia had tried hard to convert her mother to Yankee ways, and had at last given it up in despair. Rob kept on safe subjects, mainly asking {{questions}} about the crops of Peterson, and when addressing the girl, inquired of the schoolmates. By skillful questioning, he kept the subject of marriage uppermost, and seemingly was getting an inventory of the girls not yet married or engaged.|$|E
50|$|Another new {{addition}} to this season is the golden buzzer.

60|$|He {{then walked}} through the barroom, through the restaurant, and into the billiard room. The child was not there. In the latter {{apartment}} a person was standing {{by one of the}} tables with a broad-brimmed glazed hat on his head. The master recognized him as the agent of the dramatic company; he had taken a dislike to him at their first meeting, from the peculiar fashion of wearing his beard and hair. Satisfied that the object of his search was not there, he turned to the man with a glazed hat. He had noticed the master, but tried that common trick of unconsciousness in which vulgar natures always fail. Balancing a billiard cue in his hand, he pretended to play with a ball in the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> The master stood opposite to him until he raised his eyes; when their glances met, the master walked up to him.|$|E
6000|$|The Pitkin folk {{that night}} {{sat down to}} an ample feast, over which the {{impending}} Thanksgiving shed its hilarity. There {{was not only the}} inevitable great pewter platter, scoured to silver brightness, in the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and piled with solid masses of boiled beef, pork, cabbage and all sorts of vegetables, and the equally inevitable smoking loaf of rye and Indian bread, to accompany the pot of baked pork and beans, but there were specimens of all the newly-made Thanksgiving pies filling every available space on the table. Diana set special value on herself as a pie artist, and she had taxed her ingenuity this year to invent new varieties, which were received with bursts of applause by the boys. These sat down to the table in democratic equality,--Biah Carter and Abner with all the sons of the family, old and young, each eager, hungry and noisy; and over all, with moonlight calmness and steadiness, Mary Pitkin ruled and presided, dispensing to each his portion in due season, while Diana, restless and mischievous as a sprite, seemed to be possessed with an elfin spirit of drollery, venting itself in sundry little tricks and antics which drew ready laughs from the boys and reproving glances from the deacon. For the deacon was that night in one of his severest humors. As Biah Carter afterwards remarked of that night, [...] "You could feel there was thunder in the air somewhere round. The deacon had got on about his longest face, and when the deacon's face is about down to its wust, why, it would stop a robin singin'--there couldn't nothin' stan' it." ...|$|E
60|$|Willie Case {{had been}} taken to Payson {{to testify before the}} coroner's jury {{investigating}} the death of Giova's father, and with the dollar which The Oskaloosa Kid had given him in the morning burning in his pocket had proceeded to indulge in an orgy of dissipation the moment that he had been freed from the inquest. Ice cream, red pop, peanuts, candy, and soda water may have diminished his appetite but not his pride and self-satisfaction as he sat alone and by night {{for the first time in}} a public eating place. Willie was now a man of the world, a bon vivant, as he ordered ham and eggs from the pretty waitress of The Elite Restaurant on Broadway; but at heart he was not happy for never before had he realized what a great proportion of his anatomy was made up of hands and feet. As he glanced fearfully at the former, silhouetted against the white of the table cloth, he flushed scarlet, assured as he was that the waitress who had just turned away toward the kitchen with his order was convulsed with laughter and that every other eye in the establishment was glued upon him. To assume an air of nonchalance and thereby impress and disarm his critics Willie reached for a toothpick in the little glass holder near the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and upset the sugar bowl. Immediately Willie snatched back the offending hand and glared ferociously at the ceiling. He could feel the roots of his hair being consumed in the heat of his skin. A quick side glance that required all his will power to consummate showed him that no one appeared to have noticed his faux pas and Willie was again slowly returning to normal when the proprietor of the restaurant came up from behind and asked him to remove his hat.|$|E
5000|$|Each end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{is divided}} into three scoring {{sections}} by straight lines across <b>the</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> scoring sections extend from <b>the</b> very edge <b>of</b> either end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> towards <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> covering approximately one-third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> outer scoring section, at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> is labeled with the number [...] "3" [...] in the middle (for [...] "3 points").

The foul line measures 6 feet from <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> <b>center</b> third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> is unmarked. <b>The</b> line that separates <b>the</b> <b>center</b> third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "1 point" [...] section is called the [...] "foul line" [...] (a weight which does not pass the foul line closest to the player is removed from <b>the</b> <b>table</b> for <b>the</b> round). <b>The</b> <b>table</b> is surrounded by a gutter, or [...] "alley"; pucks that accidentally fall, or are knocked, into a gutter are out <b>of</b> play for <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> round.|$|R
50|$|The Antimension (Church Slavonic: Antimens) {{is similar}} to the Western corporal, though it serves a {{function}} similar to an altar stone.

Unlike the Western corporal, the Antimension is not removed from <b>the</b> Holy <b>Table</b> after <b>the</b> Eucharist is over, but is kept in <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy <b>Table,</b> covered by <b>the</b> Gospel Book.|$|R

5000|$|Hot pot or huoguo (Simplified Chinese: 火锅) is a {{traditional}} Chinese social meal. The literal Chinese translation is fire pot, as huo means fire, while guo refers to pot. The Chinese hot pot consists of a simmering metal pot <b>of</b> stock at <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dining <b>table.</b> While <b>the</b> hot pot is kept simmering, thinly sliced ingredients are placed into the pot and are cooked at <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> This type <b>of</b> cuisine is {{also referred to as}} [...] "steamboat".
