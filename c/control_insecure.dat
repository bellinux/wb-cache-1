40|$|Cloud is now tremendously growing {{technology}} in market. It provides us services beyond of our imagination, {{not only in}} the field of virtualization but it also facilitates in models like client/server deployment models. It provides advantage of distributed computing, grid computing, utility computing, autonomic computing, as well as various services like web services and software services. Cloud Computing provide various facilities and services to its user like, easy to use architecture, less cost and provide a delivery platform for customer and corporate world. The cloud has adapted technologies like SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) and virtualization. Basically, it is outsourced from the third party e. g. Amazon, which now becomes world’s largest online book store. If a technology provides us various facilities and services on demand in all cases using virtualization than there will be some sort of security issues. Although Cloud provide us security at all levels but still it have various security issues like lack of security and access <b>control,</b> <b>insecure</b> information can flow on the network that can be access by multiple virtual machines. Most of the customers are nervous while they are using cloud because they are concern about risks. So, our sensitive data is not secure in cloud. In this paper, our main concern is to review the sensitive data security on trusted third party because it is responsible for providing cloud virtual environment. We also discuss various risks, threats and vulnerabilities present in cloud and various solutions proposed for securing it...|$|E
40|$|Attachment, fear of {{intimacy}} and differentiation of self were examined {{by means of}} self-report questionnaires in 158 volunteers, including 99 clients enrolled in addiction treatment programs. As expected, clients (who were undergoing treatment for alcoholism, heroin addiction, amphetamine/cocaine addiction or cannabis abuse) {{reported higher levels of}} insecure attachment and fear {{of intimacy}}, and lower levels of secure attachment and differentiation of self, compared to <b>controls.</b> <b>Insecure</b> attachment, high fear of intimacy and low self-differentiation appear to characterize clients enrolled in addiction treatment programs. Such characteristics may reflect a predisposition to substance problems, an effect of chronic substance problems, or conceivably both...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between attachment, paranoid beliefs and hallucinatory experiences. Five hundred and three students completed online questionnaires, including the persecution and deservedness scale, the Launay–Slade hallucination scale, Bartholomew and Horowitz’s relationship questionnaire, Levenson’s multidimensional locus of control scale and measures of self-esteem and anticipation of threatening events. After comorbidity between paranoia and hallucinations was <b>controlled</b> for, <b>insecure</b> attachment predicted paranoia (persecution) but not hallucinations. The extent to which persecution was perceived to be deserved was predicted by low self-esteem. Negative self-esteem, anticipation of threatening events and a perception of others as powerful mediated {{the relationship between}} attachment insecurity and persecutory paranoia. The findings indicate that insecure attachment is specifically related to paranoid beliefs...|$|R

Lucille, an <b>insecure,</b> <b>controlling</b> woman, disapproved of Eve and her friends and family's rather liberal ways, and started becoming suspicious of the McFarrens. Lucille was harboring a secret that confused both Amanda and Amanda's first husband, architect Gordon Middleton, who Amanda left on her honeymoon when she couldn't be intimate with him.|$|R

The objective was {{to confirm that the}} measurements stored and reported by the TPM can successfully discriminate a normal boot sequence, which leaves trusted system software in <b>control,</b> from an <b>insecure</b> one, where some trusted modules might have been replaced by malicious ones. The principal tool used in the analysis was the SMV symbolic model checker. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between insecure parental attachment, religious coping, and self-esteem with Korean-American adolescents, investigating the mediation effect of self-esteem on the relationship between insecure attachment and negative religious coping. Two hundred sixty-one Korean-American adolescents aged 12 to 18 from Korean immigrant churches in seven states completed the survey questionnaire to assess their attachment relationship with their mother and father, religious coping strategies, and self-esteem. Correlation analysis revealed significant correlations among the variables, and multiple regression analyses were used to detect the unique variance of father attachment in negative religious coping and the mediation effect of self-esteem on the relationship between insecure parental attachment and negative religious coping. A hierarchical regression analysis revealed that insecure father attachment did not account for a unique variance in negative religious coping after <b>controlling</b> for <b>insecure</b> mother attachment and self-esteem. Multiple regression analyses detected the mediation effect of self-esteem, but found no gender difference in the relationship between parental attachment and negative religious coping...|$|R

They fear the stranger, they fear the new idea; they are afraid to live, and scared to die." [...] This third type needs conformity and obeys the dictates of society, adhering to a world of strict standards of right or wrong (which are manipulated by power groups to keep the <b>insecure</b> <b>controlled</b> and dependent). Cameron theorized that this type is dangerous because of its [...] "lust for authority".|$|R
40|$|The paper derives {{the global}} welfare-optimizing time path {{for a tax}} on fossil fuels causing a {{negative}} stock externality (climate change), under increasing marginal extraction cost, and {{in the presence of}} an unlimited backstop resource causing no externality. In a basic competitive case, the optimal tax equals the Pigou rate, equivalent to the present discounted value of marginal damage costs. We consider two separate types of tenure insecurity for resource owners, and their impact on the tax implementing the optimal policy. When <b>insecure</b> <b>control</b> is with respect to future ownership to the resource, competitive extraction is higher than otherwise, and the efficiency-implementing tax exceeds the Pigou rate. When tenure insecurity instead implies possible expropriation ("holdup") of investment in extraction capacity, it deters extraction, and the optimal tax is lower than the Pigou rate. Exhaustible resources Optimal emissions taxes Pigou taxation Backstop technology Insecure ownership...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: Individuals {{with type}} 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 D) face many challenges in self-management of their current disease state. Nutrition education {{has been identified as}} a key component in managing metabolic control in individuals diagnosed with T 2 D. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effect of a 4 -week nutrition intervention on glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) and nutrition knowledge by food security status in individuals with T 2 D who attend the Family Health Centers of Georgia (FHCGA) located in West Atlanta. Methods: Subjects enrolled in the study (n= 6) completed a nutrition knowledge survey at the beginning of the intervention and had their HbA 1 c values extracted from the FHCGA medical record. Subjects then entered a 4 -week group nutrition intervention program. The program consisted of four lessons that focused on the basic diet for diabetes, food label reading, grocery store shopping and eating out with diabetes. Subjects took a nutrition knowledge survey after the intervention and were asked to return to have a follow-up blood draw for HbA 1 c levels. Results: Two out of six subjects completed the entire protocol. The HbA 1 c for this subject was higher after the nutrition intervention. An additional two subjects completed all of the lessons and the post survey, but did not have a follow-up HbA 1 c drawn. The mean nutrition knowledge score pre-intervention (72. 33 + 5. 13) was lower than the mean post-intervention score (78. 67 + 4. 04) but was not significantly different. When subdivided by food security status, subjects with a higher food security status had a lower baseline HbA 1 c. Conclusion: Nutrition knowledge scores increased after nutrition education but not significantly. The effect of nutrition education on HbA 1 c by food security status could not be determined due to low participation. Future studies with a larger sample size and incentives for compliance are needed to investigate how group nutrition education influences metabolic <b>control</b> in food <b>insecure</b> and secure people with T 2 D...|$|R
