40|$|Abstract: Depression is an {{intricate}} and assorted disorder whose reason is inadequately grasped. Theories on {{the mechanisms of}} the disease have regularly spotlighted either its neurobiology or its cognitive and behavioural interpretations. Lately, studies investigating how depressed patients process reward and punishment have related these two aspects jointly. It has been proposed that individuals with a dysfunction in a specific network of brain areas are not capable to develop emotional information to <b>conduct</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Deficits in this aptitude might incline such individuals to develop depression, while consequent reinstatement of this aptitude, whether throughout pharmacological or behavioural treatments—might permit healing from the disorder. Here we analysis behavioural, neuroimaging, and computational findings pertinent to this hypothesis. There is good evidence that depressed patients reveal aberrant behavioural in response to rewards and punishments and that these propensities correspond to abnormal function in frontostriatal systems adapted by the monoamine systems. In addition, computational studies have drawn testable projections for how these neural indications and neurochemical aberration might contribute to the hallmarks of depression. Merging these approaches—as well asmolecular and behavioural task in animals—offers great promise for extending our knowledge of this ordinary and incapacitating disease...|$|E

Also a matched normal control group was recruited (n = 23). Methods: Assessments at follow‐up included diagnostic status, ADHD symptoms, oppositional and <b>conduct</b> <b>behaviour,</b> substance abuse symptoms and parenting stress. Results: Of the 24 adolescents participating in the follow‐up study, 50 % still met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. There {{were no significant differences between}} adolescents at follow‐up and those lost for follow‐up. At follow‐up, adolescents in the combined treatment condition used significantly less medication than children in the methylphenidate condition; there were no other significant differencesbetween the treatment conditions. The adolescents showed a significant decline in hyperactivity/impulsivity, oppositional and conduct disorder symptoms from post‐test to follow‐up. Only inattention symptoms increased from post‐test to follow‐up but not to pre‐test levels. The adolescents originally diagnosed with ADHD fared significantly worse than the matched controls on all outcomes, except on conduct disorder and substance abuse symptoms. Conclusions: Our study shows in adolescents, diagnosed with ADHD in childhood, age‐dependent decline of ADHD symptoms, although they still fared significantly worse than matched normal controls.

Higher binding energy of Zr 3 d lines in a plasma-sintered sample showed that ZrO 2 has strongly reacted with TiO 2, thereby enhancing the possibility of ZrTiO 4 phase formation. The increase in Al 2 p binding energy for a conventional-sintered sample indicated the reaction of Al 2 O 3 with TiO 2, which was likely to enhance Al 2 TiO 5 phase formation.

40|$|Systems of {{educational}} organisation are run {{in three ways}} (Anderson, 2005) : •	Through ‘regulatory’ responsibility to rules, regulations etc. (what can be called ‘administrative accountability’); •	Through adherence to ‘professional’ norms, values and standards (‘professional accountability’); •	 Through ‘results driven’ accountability related to the effectiveness and efficiency of the educational system in generating desired outcomes (‘performance’ or ‘outcome accountability’). The first method demands compliance with rules, regulations and laws – current procedures about child protection are an example of this, as are the current Inspection Frameworks (albeit differently administered in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland). The second method specifies the professional <b>conduct,</b> <b>behaviour</b> and processes expected from groups of professionals – the ‘Association of Educational Psychologists Code of Conduct’ {{is an example of}} this kind of accountability. And the third method attempts to take performance data about how well educational systems and schools individually have been doing into the society outside schools and colleges in order to give information to government, parents and the general public, which they will then use to inform their decisions about education. The direction of travel over the last 30 years, internationally, has been strongly of the third type - performance based reforms - using the ‘demand’ side of education as a lever of improvement through parents choosing what they see as more appropriate schools for their children, and monitoring the performance of these schools and the education system more generally. Performance based reform has also been linked to the supply side of education directly – to the actions and operation of the national and local ‘states’ that run public education. This latter model is therefore one of simultaneous ‘supply-side/demand-side’ reform, and of ‘supply-side/demand-side’ accountability, and has become increasingly influential across the world’s educational systems over time. It is also closely related to the emergence and findings of EER. <br/...|$|E
40|$|This article {{used some}} postmodern {{literary}} theories of philosophers such as Jean-François Lyotard, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Julia Kristeva to scrutinise {{a selection of}} texts from the post-exilic period {{with regard to the}} exclusive language employed in these texts. Lyotard’s insights relate to and complement Foucault’s concept of ‘counter-memory’. Foucault also focuses on the network of discursive powers that operate behind texts and reproduce them, arguing {{that it is important to}} have a look from behind so as to see which voices were silenced by the specific powers behind texts. The author briefly looked at different post-exilic texts within identity-finding contexts, focusing especially on Chronicles and a few Qumran texts, to examine the way in which they used language to create identity and to empower the community in their different contexts. It is generally accepted that both the author(s) of 1 & 2 Chronicles and the Qumran community used texts selectively, with their own nuances, omissions and additions. This study scrutinised the way the author(s) of Chronicles and the Qumran community used documents selectively, focusing on the way in which they used exclusive language. It is clear that all communities used such language in certain circumstances to strengthen a certain group’s identity, to empower them and to legitimise this group’s <b>conduct,</b> <b>behaviour</b> and claims – and thereby exclude other groups. INTRADISCIPLINARY AND/OR INTERDISCIPLINARY IMPLICATIONS : Based on postmodern literary theories, this article compares the exclusive language used in Chronicles and in the texts of the Qumran community, pointing to the practice of creating identity and empowering through discourse.

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) In this thesis, I {{examine the}} role {{performance}} {{plays in the}} adversarial criminal jury trial. The initial motivation behind this inquiry was the pervasiveness of a metaphor: why is the courtroom so frequently compared to a theatre? Most writings on this topic see the courtroom as bearing what might be termed a cosmetic resemblance to a theatre, making comparisons, for instance, between elements of costume and staging. I pursue a different line of argument. I argue that performance is not simply an embellishment of the trial process but rather a constitutive feature of the criminal jury trial. It is by means of what I call the performance of tradition that the trial acquires its social significance as a (supposedly) timeless bulwark of authority and impartiality. In the first three chapters I show that popular usage of the term ‘theatrical’ (whether it be to describe the practice of a flamboyant lawyer, or a misbehaving defendant) is frequently laden with pejorative connotations and invariably (though usually only implicitly) invokes comparison to a presupposed authentic or natural way of behaviour (‘not-performing’). Drawing {{on the work of}} Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu I argue that, whatever legal agents see as appropriate trial <b>conduct</b> (<b>behaviour</b> that is ‘not-performing’), they are misrecognising the performative accomplishments and demands required of both legal agents and laypersons in the trial. This performance constructs and maintains a gap between legal practitioners and laypersons which is essential to maintaining the status of the legal profession, and which continually positions the trial in legal and popular belief. I then look at specific moments of ‘anxiety’ where alterations to traditional procedure provoke debate as to the otherwise unnoticed or unarticulated value of live performance. In Chapter 4, I examine the growth of the private advocacy training industry that frequently positions lawyers as actors. Resistance to the idea of acting demonstrates the tainted status of performance terminology as well as legal agents’ belief that lawyers are acting naturally. I argue instead that lawyers have always been trained in acting: an habituated performance style I term legal naturalism. In Chapter 5, I examine the television broadcasting of trials. Some legal agents argue that broadcasting risks ‘theatricalising’ the trial—causing participants to ‘act up’. However, this overlooks the fact that the court has a long history as a source of popular entertainment. I argue that resistance to broadcasting also stems from a reluctance to remit control of the trial to external producers. Broadcasting invites greater scrutiny into a process that if not always fair, needs to be believed in as fair and has historically been tightly self-regulated by the legal field, through its reliance on live performance’s ‘essential’ quality—its inability to be captured and subsequent disappearance. In Chapter 6, I examine the debates around CCTV testimony, which demonstrate a consistency of belief in live or ‘face-to-face’ confrontation to produce juridical ‘Truth’ that can be traced back over 800 years. The final chapter of this thesis examines sexual assault trials. This chapter brings together all of these sources of anxiety. Although often termed ‘exceptional’, sexual assault trials highlight how essential live performance is to manufacturing the authority of ‘The Law’ through the weight given to demeanour assessment, and because these trials make visible the sustained symbolic violence characteristic of adversarial criminal trials that is particularly traumatic for sexual assault complainants. Examination of sexual assault trials also reveals the double-edged position of performance in the trial. The exploitation of the symbolic value of live performance is the source of much trauma, yet the performance of tradition is also essential to maintaining popular belief in the adversarial criminal jury trial...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} research, set in {{two schools}} in Malmö, Sweden, {{was to examine the}} {{outcomes}} of a combined approach of a behavioural modification program and a biofeedback intervention for students, aged 7 to 12, with behavioural and concentration difficulties. Biofeedback is the use of technology to measure physiological changes in the body (such as heart rate and breathing) and gives this information back to the user. The behavioural modification program was an intervention known as Family Class, whereby students (and their parents) attended for 12 weeks to work on classroom issues identified by the teacher. It is accepted that students with behavioural and concentration difficulties are at risk of going on to develop more severe problems such as ADHD, if early intervention programs are not implemented (Barkley, 1996). In addition, the Swedish education system is under increasing political pressure given poor international results (PISA, 2013) and poor high school graduation rates (Cederberg et al, 2011). Working as a social worker across two schools, I was ideally placed to assess the current intervention provision, adapt it and subsequently carry out the research to evaluate the outcomes. The research drew on a pragmatist epistemology (Hall, 2013) that supported the semi-experimental design used in the study. A mixed methods approach to gathering the data from parents, teachers and the students was used. Qualitative data collected before and after the intervention, were sought through interviews with students in which vignettes were used to identify their ideas on self-regulation of behaviour, whilst quantitative data on the impact of the combined intervention were gathered through pre/post measures using The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, Biofeedback software and behavioural sheets. The thesis also traces the author’s changing identity from a practitioner to a researcher-practitioner. The experience of doing the research was interwoven into the fabric of the study, helping to ensure that the study is rooted in practice. In that respect, a key social work value, empowerment, was critically discussed by referring to the theories of Michel Foucault and John Dewey. A view that self-regulation can be seen as an act of empowerment was the resulting outcome of this theoretical discussion. This position supported the author’s personal practice and the intention behind the intervention was the focus of the research. The key findings from the qualitative data suggested {{that the majority of the}} sample of 13 students (most of whom had experienced difficulties for more than a year) had learnt self-regulation skills and understood self-regulation ideas; from their responses to the vignettes, it appeared students had moved from a position of reliance on teachers and other adults when managing behaviour and concentration difficulties to a position that encouraged a balance between the students’ self understanding on how to manage classroom challenges and the role the teacher can play in this. This was backed up by SDQ feedback from the parents and teachers on the changes in the students’ own behaviour in relation to the following categories: hyperactivity and attention, peer interaction and pro-social behaviour, <b>conduct</b> <b>behaviour,</b> emotional difficulties, impact on relationships and perceptions of the problem. The biofeedback data also showed that the group as a whole had learnt how to regulate their breathing and heart rate. The key implications for social work practice are that the combination of a behavioural modification approach such as Family Class with biofeedback has potential in helping students with behavioural and concentration difficulties in a school setting. The methods and methodology used in this research proved to be a suitable approach to identifying the impacts of an innovative intervention and could be considered by other social workers carrying out research in similar settings...|$|E

We recently reported the conventional piezoelectric material Na 1 / 2 Bi 1 / 2 TiO 3 (NBT) can be tuned into a novel oxide-ion conductor with an oxide-ion transport number (tion) > 0. 9 by creating bismuth and oxygen vacancies. A small Bi-excess in the nominal starting composition (Na 0. 50 Bi 0. 50 +xTiO 3 + 3 x/ 2, x = 0. 01) or Nb-donor doping (Na 0. 50 Bi 0. 50 Ti 1 −yNbyO 3 +y/ 2, 0. 005 ≤ y ≤ 0. 030) can reduce significantly the electrical conductivity to create dielectric behaviour by filling oxygen vacancies and suppressing oxide ion conduction (tion ≤ 0. 10). Here we show a further increase in the starting Bi-excess content (0. 02 ≤ x ≤ 0. 10) reintroduces significant levels of oxide-ion conductivity and increases tion ∼ 0. 4 – 0. 6 to create mixed ionic/electronic behaviour. The switch from insulating to mixed <b>conducting</b> <b>behaviour</b> for x > 0. 01 is linked to the presence of Bi-rich secondary phases and we discuss possible explanations for this effect. Mixed <b>conducting</b> <b>behaviour</b> with tion ∼ 0. 5 – 0. 6 can also be achieved with lower levels of Nb-doping (y ∼ 0. 003) due to incomplete filling of oxygen vacancies without the presence of secondary phases. NBT can now be compositionally tailored to exhibit three types of electrical behaviour; Type I (oxide-ion conductor); Type II (mixed ionic-electronic conductor); Type III (insulator) and these results reveal an approach to fine-tune tion in NBT from near unity to zero. In addition to developing new oxide-ion and now mixed ionic/electronic NBT-based conductors, this flexibility in control of oxygen vacancies allows fine-tuning of both the dielectric/piezoelectric properties and design manufacturing practices for NBT-based multilayer piezoelectric devices...|$|R

40|$|Terpolymer MAF {{synthesized}} by the polycondensation of melamine (M) and aniline (A) with formaldehyde (F) in {{the presence}} of an acid catalyst in 1 : 1 : 3 molar proportions of the reacting monomers. Polychelates were prepared by using metal acetate, metal salts and MAF ligand in DMF medium. The prepared terpolymer and its polychelates were characterized by using elemental analysis, magnetic studies and spectral analysis. In the present paper, electrical conductivity properties of the terpolymer and its polychelates were studied over a wide range of temperature and is in the order MAF <Mn(II) <Fe(III) and <Co(II). The of log σversus 1 /T. Activation energy values lie in the range of 0. 847 eV to 1. 156 eV. On the basis of electrical conductivity measurements of terpolymer and its polychelates, it was found that, at higher temperature conductivity increases linearly, showing semi <b>conducting</b> <b>behaviour</b> and hence useful in electronic industry...|$|R
