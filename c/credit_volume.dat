40|$|We use a {{broad range}} of {{contractual}} information to assess the empirical relevance of different financial theories of trade credit. The common feature of all financial theories is that suppliers have an advantage over other lenders in financing credit-constrained firms. While the reasons for the financing advantage differ across theories, they are usually related either to product characteristics or to market structure. We propose a novel identifying strategy that exploits this insight to analyse the trade <b>credit</b> <b>volume</b> and the contract terms. Our analysis suggests that the most important product characteristic for explaining trade <b>credit</b> <b>volume</b> and contract terms is the ease with which the seller’s product can be diverted.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} collateral on moral hazard and <b>credit</b> <b>volume.</b> A standard theoretical argument {{for the use of}} collateral is its power in reducing problems of moral hazard. However, collateral may also be used as a screening device and existing empirical studies have not isolated the incentive effect of collateral. This paper uses experimental tools to identify the effect. The results show that collateral significantly decreases moral hazard when interest rates are low. Interestingly, if interest rates are high, it does not. The results suggest that borrowers’loss aversion offsets the incentive effect of collateral when interest rates are high. Importantly, collateral increases credit supply. But, if interest rates are high, increases in collateral also lead to a decrease in credit demand. These findings suggest that, in credit markets with high interest rates, the effect of collateral on moral hazard and <b>credit</b> <b>volume</b> may be weaker than expected...|$|E

40|$|The Basel Committee for Banking Supervision {{recently}} drew a {{great deal}} of attention when they published their proposal for a New Basel Capital Accord (2001). Among the critisism, praise, and numerous responses it generated, one aspect was given very little attention: the credit cycle. Traditionally, credit had been granted at the same or very similar conditions to all the credit applicants who qualified. As a consequence, lending volume was pro-cyclical. During times when the economy was strong, many candidates were able to meet the qualification criteria and <b>credit</b> <b>volume</b> increased, its rate of increase often exceeding economic growth by a good margin. On the other hand, during recessions, fewer candidates qualified, and therefore <b>credit</b> <b>volume</b> shrank. In extreme cases, a credit crunch resulted. Increasing lending during growth times tends to stimulate further growth, decreasing lending to exacerbate a recession. Pro-cyclical bank lending is therefore considered harmful to economic stability. Another consequence of the traditional lending ways was the subsidizing of higher-risk debtors by lower-risk debtors. Risk-adjusted credit pricing Because a system based on subsidization is unsustainable in the long term, the traditional lending methodology collapsed as high-quality borrowers moved to other sources of financing, such a...|$|E
