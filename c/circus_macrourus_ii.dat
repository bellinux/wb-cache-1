40|$|Understanding {{the ecology}} of migratory birds during the non-breeding season is {{necessary}} for ensuring their conservation. Using satellite telemetry data we describe winter ranging behaviour and movements of pallid harriers <b>Circus</b> <b>macrourus</b> that bred in Kazakhstan. We developed an ecological niche model for the species in Africa, to identify the most suitable wintering areas for pallid harriers {{and the importance of}} habitat in determining the location of those areas. We also assessed how well represented suitable areas are in the network of protected areas. Individual harriers showed relatively high fidelity to wintering areas but with potential for interannual changes. The ecological niche model highlighted the importance of open habitats with natural vegetation. Most suitable areas for the species were located in eastern Africa. Suitable areas had a patchy distribution but were relatively well included in the network of protected areas. The preferential use of habitats with natural vegetation by wintering pallid harriers and the patchiness of the most suitable areas highlight the harrier's vulnerability to land-use changes and the associated loss of natural vegetation in Africa. Conservation of harriers could be enhanced by preserving natural grasslands within protected areas and improving habitat management in the human-influenced portions of the species' core wintering areas.

40|$|Organochlorine {{compounds}} (OC) are {{of interest}} in current biomonitoring studies because of their well-known persistence, accumulation capacity and the adverse effects they caused in the past. P,p′-DDE {{has been shown to}} cause severe reproductive failures and population declines in birds of prey. However, there are knowledge gaps regarding OC exposure for some species (e. g. harriers), the historical record and the broader picture. The main goal was to evaluate exposure to p,p′-DDE and PCBs in two raptor species: Montagu's and pallid harriers (Circus pygargus and <b>Circus</b> <b>macrourus),</b> and to investigate if birds from different breeding areas and wintering grounds differ in pollutant levels. For this purpose, we collected blood of adult and nestling Montagu's and pallid harriers breeding in the natural steppes of Kazakhstan, and adult and nestling Montagu's harriers breeding in agricultural and natural habitats of Spain, in 2007 – 2008. We determined the blood concentrations of p,p′-DDE and PCBs. Adult harriers generally showed higher concentrations of p,p′-DDE and PCBs than nestlings, probably because they had more time for a progressive accumulation of these compounds due to a higher intake than excretion rate. The p,p′-DDE concentrations in adults were equivalent in all the studied areas. The ratio p,p′-DDE/PCB 153 was higher in adults than in nestlings, suggesting that a portion of the p,p′-DDE in adult harriers may have come from p,p′-DDT applied in the past in the wintering areas. Overall, the concentrations of p,p′-DDE and ∑ PCBs reported were generally low and below any demonstrated threshold of harm.

40|$|Specialist species, using {{a narrow}} range of resources, are {{predicted}} to be more efficient when foraging on their preferred food than generalist species consuming {{a wider range of}} foods. We tested whether the foraging efficiency of the pallid harrier <b>Circus</b> <b>macrourus,</b> a vole specialist, and of sympatric Montagu's harriers C. pygargus, a closely related generalist, differed in relation to inter-annual variations in vole abundance over five years (including two peak- one intermediate and two low vole abundance years). We show that the hunting parameters of pallid harriers strongly varied with vole abundance (higher encounter rates, capture rates and proportion of successful strikes in high than intermediate and low vole abundance years, respectively), whereas Montagu's harriers showed stable capture rates and hunting success (proportion of strikes that were successful), irrespective of vole abundance. Encounter rates and capture rates were higher for pallid than for Montagu's harriers when voles were abundant, but lower when voles were scarce. The hunting success of pallid harriers was also lower than that of Montagu's harriers when voles were scarce, and when they had to target alternative preys, in particular birds. Overall, estimated biomass intake rate was 40 % higher for pallid harriers than for Montagu's harriers when voles were abundant, but 50 % lower when voles were scarce. Our results indicate that specialists predators, like pallid harriers, which evolve specific adaptations or breeding strategies, do better when their preferred prey is abundant, but may face a cost of specialisation, being not efficient enough when their preferred prey is scarce. These results have broader implications for understanding why specialist predators are, in general, more vulnerable than generalists, and for predicting how specialists can cope with rapid environmental changes affecting the abundance or predictability of their preferred resources.

40|$|Ecological {{specialization}} {{can explain}} the declining status of many species {{in the face of}} current global changes. Amongst specialists, nomadic predators present conservation biologists with many challenges, mainly because of the difficulty of studying highly mobile individuals over time and across very large areas. For these species, the relative influence of prey abundance, habitat heterogeneity and arrival time at the breeding grounds on breeding parameters remains poorly understood. We studied the factors influencing variation in breeding numbers and performance of a declining nomadic specialist raptor, the Pallid Harrier <b>Circus</b> <b>macrourus,</b> in north-central Kazakhstan. During a 5 -year period, we recorded large inter-annual variation in vole abundance in the main study area, and differences between habitats. We also recorded a strong numerical response of breeding Pallid Harriers to inter-annual changes in local vole abundance. From a 13 -year dataset on breeding harriers in the same area, harrier numbers appeared to vary cyclically, with an interval between peaks of approximately 6 years. At a broader, regional scale, variations in Pallid Harrier abundance appeared asynchronous, suggesting a regional redistribution of harriers between years. Reproductive success depended on local vole abundance, but also on timing of breeding and nesting habitat. Clutch size, nest success and fledged brood size increased with vole abundance. Late breeders had smaller clutches and apparently lower hatching rates than early ones, possibly {{as a result of the}} interplay between their probable poorer body condition and habitat-specific variation in predation rates. In true nomadic specialist predators, such as Pallid Harriers, breeding success may therefore depend on a complex interplay between spatial variation in prey abundance, habitat composition and timing of breeding attempts. One of the factors influencing the start of breeding is the length of time taken to prospect between different breeding sites, which in turn may depend on the predictability of spatial and temporal variation in vole abundance. These results have important conservation implications, as changes in climate and habitat could affect spatial and temporal variations in vole abundance, with possible consequences for timing of breeding, food availability and, ultimately, the reproductive success of this declining nomadic predator.

50|$|The swamp lies {{on one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} bird migration routes in the world, and over 250 species of birds have been recorded in the area, including the globally vulnerable greater spotted eagle (Aquila clanga), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), and lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni). Records of globally near-threatened bird species at the wetland include great snipe (Gallinago media), ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca) and pallid harrier (<b>Circus</b> <b>macrourus).</b> In addition to the great diversity of birds in the area, there are a wide variety of animals living in and around the marsh. Twenty-three species of mammals have been recorded, including jungle cat (Felis chaus) and European otter (Lutra lutra). Five species of amphibians and twelve species of reptiles have been recorded, and a two-year weekly butterfly survey found fifty-three species of butterflies in the area. The wetland lies 7 km SSW of the city of Qab Elias on the eastern edge of Mount Lebanon. The main area of reedbeds and open pools covers 253 ha, stretching east from the foot of the mountains to the Litani River in a long strip. Rain and snow falling on the high ridge of Barouk mountain to the west provide water for the wetland. Most rain falls between December and March, soaking quickly through layers of limestone in the mountains and emerging as springs in the valley floor. The water is particularly pure, as it has not been polluted by agricultural fertilizers, pesticides, etc. In recent years the marsh dried out by mid-July (with the exception of a few deep pools and ditches) and did not fill up again until January or February. However, the introduction by A Rocha's involvement of improved management techniques, such as the reduced pumping of water for irrigation of nearby farmland, and changes to less “thirsty” crops, has helped the marsh remain wet throughout the year. This has resulted in a significant increase in wintering and breeding water birds since 2002. Surrounding the open water and reed bed are areas of rough grazing, cultivated land, drainage ditches, and an avenue of trees, all adding to the diversity of habitats in the area. On the nearby mountain slopes, small wooded areas and rocky shrubland give an even greater variety of habitats and species. Behind the nearby village of Aammiq are woods where Syrian woodpecker (Dendrocopus syriacus) and Syrian serin (Serinus syriacus) can be found. In spring and summer, shrubby hillsides are home to assorted buntings, wheatears, warblers and shrikes, and rocky gorges host western rock nuthatch (Sitta neumayer) and Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo). Mammals present include Caucasian squirrel, wildcat, wild boar and the elusive Indian porcupine..The Aammiq Wetland and some of the surrounding area is in the process of being declared a National Reserve. The main landowning family is fully engaged in the preservation of this very important ecosystem and initial plans to develop the area for ecotourism are underway.|$|R
2500|$|In the Palearctic, {{the golden}} eagle co-exists {{with several other}} large {{raptorial}} birds called eagles. Unlike in their relationship with smaller raptors, golden eagles are rarely reported to hunt other eagle species. Most conflicts between different eagles are over kills or carrion, though some species will defend nesting territories from each other. When it comes to carrion and kills, usually the “aggressor” (that is the eagle who initiates the agonistic behavior) is victorious over the other eagle. Considering that they overlap considerably in both distribution and prey selection, there is remarkably almost no known accounts from Eurasia of golden eagles behaving aggressively with other Aquila eagles. This is possibly due to segregated habitat preferences amongst these species, with lesser and greater spotted eagles being essentially woodland or wooded wetland-dwelling birds, Spanish and eastern imperial eagles inhabiting fragmented, open woods and steppe eagles generally living in flat, often treeless steppe and desert-like habitats. In central Asia, where golden eagles and other Aquila species are rare or absent, steppe eagles sometimes nest in mountainous rock formations like golden eagles. Compared to these eagles, the Bonelli's eagle {{appears to have a}} more contentious relationship with golden eagles, as they are often attracted to similar prey (largely rabbits and gamebirds) and occur in abutting habitats. The larger golden eagle is apparently dominant and, in at least one case, has killed and consumed a Bonelli's. The two species defend their territories from one another exclusively, in the same way they defend them from others of their own species. Both will use nests built by the other species, more so the golden using Bonelli's nests than vice versa. Further east, in Israel, Bonelli's and golden eagles are competitors as well. In the dry, barren Negev Desert, golden eagles nests were found [...] apart and Bonelli's were scarce. In the Judaean Desert, which has more annual rainfall and more available prey, the distance between golden eagle nests averaged [...] and the Bonelli's eagle easily outnumbered them. Apparently, the Bonelli's eagle exceptionally outcompeted its larger cousin here due to a subtle topographic variation in the habitat. Still, in areas without unnatural human pressures, the gradation between these species is still adequate enough that they can exist without serious negative effect on either population. In Japan, golden eagles were observed to hunt mountain hawk-eagles (Nisaetus nipalensis), {{despite the fact that the}} local race of hawk eagle is around the same mass as a Japanese golden eagle. The Bale Mountains of Ethiopia is arguably the richest biosphere the golden eagle is known to inhabit and there, this species may potentially interact with more than 10 other eagle species and nearly 30 other accipitrid species, including both migratory and resident breeding species. These are often supported by an exceptionally diverse, dense population of rodents there. The Bale Mountains golden eagles were recorded kleptoparatisizing steppe eagles, augur buzzard (Buteo augur), pallid harrier (<b>Circus</b> <b>macrourus)</b> and lanner falcons (Falco biarmicus) and the eagles were themselves kleptoparatisized by steppe eagles on three occasions. The golden eagles were also observed to chase tawny and steppe eagles out of their nesting territories. In the Bale Mountains, the golden eagle overlaps with perhaps its closest living relative, the Verreaux's eagle. The golden eagles appear to vigorously defend their territories from the Verreaux's eagles and, as in its relationship with the Bonelli's, the two species appear to maintain exclusive territories. Several chases involving the golden chasing Verreaux's were witnessed but only one where a Verreaux's chased off the golden. Despite several reported antagonistic interactions, no other raptors were found as prey in the Bale Mountains nests of golden eagles.|$|R

40|$|Steppe {{habitats}} {{in central}} Asia have suffered important land use changes during this century which {{are similar to}} those that have been pointed out as the causes of the decline of steppe birds in western Europe. During June 1999 we conducted road surveys of raptors in Eastern Kazakhstan to detect specific and community responses to land use changes. We detected 11 species of raptors. Kestrels (Falco naumanni and tinnunculus) were the most common species in grasslands and agricultural landscapes, harriers (<b>Circus</b> pygargus and <b>macrourus)</b> were dominant in saline steppes and steppe eagles (Aquila nipalensis) were dominant in dry steppes. There were fewer species in agricultural habitats than in grassland and steppe habitats. Ground-nesting raptors were negatively affected by land use changes and four species were never detected in agricultural zones. Raptor abundance patterns differed between natural steppe habitats and human-transformed habitats, where a patchy distribution was detected. The future of raptor communities in Kazakhstan seems uncertain although the progressive abandonment of intensive agriculture may benefit species sensitive to human presence. The long-term conservation of vertebrate communities may depend upon the maintenance of ecologically and socially sustainable grazing systems. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
