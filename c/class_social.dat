5|$|By 1960, Quwatli had quarreled with Nasser {{and criticized}} his {{policies}} in Syria. In particular, he condemned {{the institution of}} land distribution and industrial nationalization in July 1961, stating it would harm the economy severely. He was also personally affronted that his son-in-law Fayez al-Ujl had much of his property seized by the government {{as part of the}} socialist measures. Resentment towards the union across the spectrum of Syria's political <b>class,</b> <b>social</b> elite and officer corps was on the rise, with these key groups chafing at the centralization of authority into Nasser's hands, domination by a vastly larger Egypt at the political, social and economic levels and the sidelining of these groups in the governance of Syria. The Syrian public also grew wary of the virtual police state set up in the country by Sarraj. A coup by secessionist officers was undertaken in Syria on 28 September, effectively breaking up the UAR. Quwatli lent his support toward the coup, aligning himself with the secessionist officers.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a decline}} in social {{mobility}} for those of less prominent clans, the local elites became far more integrated into a nationwide upper <b>class</b> <b>social</b> structure during the Eastern Han period, thus expanding the classification of who belonged to the upper class. The emerging gentry class—which became fully consolidated during the Eastern Han—consisted of unemployed scholars, teachers, students, and government officials. These men, although geographically separated and mired in local activities, started to view themselves as participants in wider national affairs of politics and scholarship. They recognized shared values of filial piety, deference, and emphasizing study in the Five Classics over holding public office. Emperors Yuan and Cheng were forced to abandon their resettlement schemes for officials and their families around the royal tombs settlement in 40 BCE and 15 BCE, respectively; unlike the days of Emperor Wu, historian Cho-Yun Hsu asserts {{that at this point}} officials and scholars had so much influence in both local and national-level politics that to forcibly relocate them became unthinkable.|$|E

This article uses data from an interview study of 248 young Londoners (young women and men; black, white and of `mixed-parentage') to examine the place of <b>social</b> <b>class</b> in young people's lives. The young people's accounts indicated that they did not necessarily use occupational groupings in defining <b>social</b> <b>class</b> and that the majority considered themselves to be middle <b>class.</b> Nonetheless, <b>social</b> <b>class</b> was important {{to the ways in which}} they thought about themselves.

5000|$|It {{was found}} that <b>social</b> <b>class</b> of origin predicts {{educational}} attainment in both the participant's and offspring generations. Father's <b>social</b> <b>class</b> and participant's <b>social</b> <b>class</b> held the same importance in predicting offspring educational attainment - effect across two generations. Educational attainment mediated the association of <b>social</b> <b>class</b> attainments across generations (father's and participants <b>social</b> <b>class,</b> participant's and offspring's <b>social</b> <b>class).</b> There was no direct link <b>social</b> <b>classes</b> across generations, but in each generation educational attainment was a predictor of <b>social</b> <b>class,</b> {{which is consistent with}} other studies. Also, participant's childhood ability moderately predicted their educational and <b>social</b> <b>class</b> attainment (.31 and [...]38). Participant's educational attainment was strongly linked with the odds of moving downward or upward on the <b>social</b> <b>class</b> ladder. For each SD increase in education, the odds of moving upward on the <b>social</b> <b>class</b> spectrum were 2.58 times greater (the downward ones were [...]26 times greater). Offspring's educational attainment was also strongly linked with the odds of moving upward or downward on the <b>social</b> <b>class</b> ladder. For each SD increase in education, the odds of moving upward were 3.54 times greater (the downward ones were [...]40 times greater). In conclusion, education is very important, because it is the fundamental mechanism functioning both to hold individuals in their <b>social</b> <b>class</b> of origin and {{to make it possible for}} their movement upward or downward on the <b>social</b> <b>class</b> ladder.|$|R

25|$|In Europe, the Intelligentsia existed as {{a status}} <b>class</b> (<b>social</b> stratum) before the coinage {{of the term}} intelligentsia (the intellectuals) in the 19th century.

As people whose professions placed them (physically, economically, and socially) outside the traditional places and functions of the town-and-country monarchic social-classes (royalty, aristocracy, bourgeoisie) of the time, the intelligentsia were an urban social-class.|$|E

In the course of those salons Coco Chanel befriended Arthur ‘Boy’ Capel, an English socialite and polo player friend of Étienne Balsan; per the upper <b>class</b> <b>social</b> custom, Chanel also became mistress to Boy Capel. Despite that social circumstance, Boy Capel perceived the businesswoman innate to Coco Chanel, and, in 1910, financed her first independent millinery shop, Chanel Modes, at 21 rue Cambon, Paris. Because that locale already housed a dress shop, the business-lease limited Chanel to selling only millinery products, not couture. Two years later, in 1913, the Deauville and Biarritz couture shops of Coco Chanel offered for sale prêt-à-porter sports clothes for women, the practical designs of which allowed the wearer to play sport.|$|E

25|$|Lubomirski {{expanded}} the palace {{by building a}} southern wing, perpendicular {{to the rest of}} structure, and also {{expanded the}} western elevation. Shortly after its construction the palace became known as Palais Martin, after Lubomirski's grandson. In 1720 the palace was rebuilt with an addition of a second northern wing. Additionally the interior was decorated with rococo paintings. After 1777 the palace passed into ownership of Poland's last king, Stanisław II Augustus, who hired the architect Domenico Merlini to once again redesign the inside rooms of the palace and join the library wing of the Royal Castle to it. The king then made a present of the redecorated place to his nephew Prince Józef Poniatowski The younger Poniatowski was a successful commander in the 1794 Kościuszko Uprising, and later one of Napoleon Bonaparte's marshals. Under his ownership the palace became a center of Warsaw's high <b>class</b> <b>social</b> scene.

25|$|The {{protests against}} the Oresharski cabinet were {{supported}} by 60 percent of Bulgarians, according to a poll by the independent Alpha Research {{for the month of}} November. Research conducted by the Sofia Open Society Institute (analyzing the political situation in the country {{over the course of the}} June and July months) reveals that the most active participants in the protests tended to be young (aged below 30 years), were based in the capital Sofia, leaned to the centre-right or right of the political spectrum and possessed a higher than average income. The middle <b>class</b> <b>social</b> stratum from Sofia has been singled out as constituting a core of the protest. Similarly, Leviev-Sawyer believes that even during its short escalation phase in late July 2013, the demonstrations retained features of protests typical of the middle class. A generational gap as well as an urban-rural divide have been a feature of the public reactions to the demonstrations, with those residing in non-urban areas and aged over 60 on the whole significantly less supportive of the protests. Goranova identifies the primacy of economic over political concerns due to poverty, the presence of remnants of feudalist structures in the smaller cities and villages (causing a certain built-in reluctance to protest due to fears of job losses), the significant proportion of elderly people (who have a natural aversion to instability) and the lack of sufficient trust in the youth as some of the reasons for the lacking protest activities outside the major cities. In addition, members of ethnic minority groups were generally not as favorably disposed to the protests, with this finding especially applicable to ethnic Turks and Romani people who typically declared a lesser willingness to participate in demonstrations in comparison to ethnic Bulgarians. Confederation of Labour Podkrepa president Konstantin Trenchev, in an August 2013 interview, did not call for national strike action against the government, but cautioned that conditions may become ripe for resorting to such activities at some point in the autumn. The trade union has been criticized by some experts for violating the constitution by setting political targets for itself and engaging in the type of political activism that is the prerogative solely of political parties. A late January 2014 survey conducted by the Confederation of Independent Syndicates in Bulgaria revealed that at least one third of their members were adamant that Parliamentary elections need to be held alongside the upcoming European elections.|$|E
