40|$|Pressure {{distributions}} {{created by}} wind flow on low slope roofs {{is an issue}} addressed by many wind tunnel studies and selective field experimental studies. Building codes and standards specify pressure coefficient data to determine the wind loads for commercial roofing claddings. Field measurements can provide valuable data to validate the current code provisions for wind loads, as well provide supporting data for existing wind uplift test methods for roof claddings. Thus the Special Interest Group on Dynamic Evaluation of Roofing Systems (SIGDERS) selected four locations (Ottawa, Vancouver, Mt. Pleasant and Rialto) across North America and collected wind speed, wind direction and wind pressure data for extended time periods to understand the wind interaction with low slope membrane roofs. This paper presents the data collected from November 2012 to November 2013 from the Ottawa, Ontario site. Based on the National Building Code of Canada 5 ̆f 3 s (NBCC) zoning procedure, pressure taps were installed to obtain data for the corner, edge and field roof zones. Occurrences of wind speed exceeding 16 m s 2 ̆ 07 b 9 were considered for various wind directions. Peak and mean pressure coefficients were calculated and compared with NBCC (2010) 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>specifications.</b> When instantaneous peak pressure coefficients were compared with the NBCC (2010), the measured data exceeded NBCC (2010) 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>specifications</b> for some wind directions. Nevertheless, when the pressure coefficients were compared by paring with their respective tributary area, the data concluded that the current NBCC (2010) 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>specifications</b> for the roof cladding and components are equally adequate for the wind load design of low slope membrane roofs.

The study built on work done in 1980 by George Huddleston of the Mainville Forest Products Corporation. Selected for the study were two inks that closely resembled the ink specifications identified by Mr. Huddleston. The quantification of quality was made by printing UPC Symbols on single-wall corrugated board with the flexographic printing process, and observing the percentage of these symbols found to be printed within tolerance.
