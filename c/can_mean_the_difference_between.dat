In the case of knocked-out teeth, being prepared and knowing what to do <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> a person retaining or losing replanted knocked-out teeth for life. Teeth that have been knocked out when they are fully matured, that is, when the root has completely formed, have a much better prognosis than those teeth that are immature and not fully formed. This is due to the fragility of the root. When teeth have not fully formed, the walls of the root are thinner and thus more fragile. Another complication for the prognosis is the length of time that the tooth has been out of its socket. Teeth that are replanted within fifteen minutes of the accident have an excellent prognosis. Teeth that have been extra-oral and dry stored for more than one hour have a poor prognosis. Teeth that have been placed in an optimal storage medium within one hour of the accident also have an excellent prognosis. All teeth that have been knocked out should be replanted but watched carefully for the development of root resorption. Teeth that do not have root canal treatment within two weeks of replantation also have a poor prognosis.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The United States {{today has}} become 2 ̆ 2 meeting-conscious. 2 ̆ 2 The {{complexity}} of conducting business {{has led to}} the need for sophisticated coordination of decision-making processes on all levels of the organization. Company meetings have played an increasingly important role in the success and future of many companies. Strategies and decisions are developed at meetings that can determine future policies of crucial importance. Executive training <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in whether <b>the</b> company will even survive. Large and growing companies have increased their off-premise meeting budgets annually in spite {{of the state of the}} economy. however, the rising costs of travel and lodging have made management monitor these budgets more closely than ever. Thus, the need to use every dollar efficiently has compelled companies to examine newer methods of running meetings and alternatives to the usage of typical off-premise meeting facilities. The importance of off-premise meetings in the United States economy has greatly increased due to the billions of dollars spent annually. These factors make it vital to explore the effectiveness of time and monetary expenditures. Up until the mid- 19602 ̆ 7 s, company meetings were held in facilities of various design and purpose, none of which were specifically designed for the small to medium corporate meeting. Upon gathering information concerning the meetings market and the corporate meeting planner, certain individuals endeavored to change the situation. This study is designed to investigate this new concept, which will hereafter be referred to as 2 ̆ 2 conference center. 2 ̆ 2 For the purpose of this study, the following two definitions will be used. 1. Conference center - that meeting facility primarily marketing its facilities for the small to medium-sized corporate meeting. The center is operated by specialists aware of market needs in as much detail as are those people working for the company involved. On-premise sleeping rooms are not mandatory provided such facilities are within easy access. 2. Meeting planner - that person within an organization who has primary responsibility for arranging off-premise meetings and all other related items necessary for meeting effectiveness. This person may spend anywhere from 10 to 100 l of his time in this capacity. The conference center has effectively satisfied the need for specialized corporate meeting facilities. This study will show the depth of the corporate meetings market and trace the growth and development of this relatively new conference center concept. Information will also be compiled on the top centers in the country. It is hoped that by presenting this research meeting planners will become more aware of the nature and location of these centers, especially for use by the small to medium-sized company. Such exposure of the centers will hopefully increase existing demand and enable the construction of new, innovative centers...|$|R

Beyond physiological and nonverbal techniques for detecting deception, {{research has focused on}} criteria designed to evaluate the content of verbal statements to distinguish between true or actually experienced events versus internally manufactured or fabricated events. Criteria from two techniques that have received empirical support, criteria-based content analysis and reality monitoring, were used to create an 11 -item Deception Detection Checklist (DDCL). In this study, 130 college undergraduates used the DDCL to rate the exculpatory statements of two accused child molesters: one truthful, the other untruthful. The 11 items composing the DDCL, as well as a measure of perceived truthfulness, were all scored on 7 -point Likert-type scales. Nine of the 11 items on the DDCL significantly differentiated between the true and untrue statements in the predicted direction. Overall scores on the DDCL indicated that the false statement was rated as significantly more deceptive than the true statement. The DDCL possessed good reliability, and a series of factor analyses provided strong support for the construct validity of the measure. The 7 psychometrically strongest items from the DDCL included variables assessing the extent to which statements included clarity of detail, spatial details, temporal details, and contextual details, as well as the relevance, reconstructability, and realism of the statement. These results indicate that subjects were able to use this measure to reliably differentiate between true and false statements made by accused child molesters...|$|R

5000|$|Human {{papilloma}} virus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal cancer {{awareness and}} prevention {{is a vital}} concept from a public and community health perspective. HPV is the sexually transmitted virus that {{is known to be}} the cause of genital warts. There are currently more than 100 different strains of HPV, half of which can cause genital infections. It is worth noting here that although it is not usually the HPV strains that cause genital warts that are associated with the oropharyngeal cancers, they are transmitted the same way through oral-genital sexual contact, and consumers should protect themselves accordingly and adhere to a routine health and dental screening schedule to monitor and maintain their health status. Learning and utilizing self-examinations of your body, checking for changes or abnormalities in your mouth while performing your oral hygiene as well as routine checks of your genitals after showering to note changes or abnormalities can enhance your awareness of changes in your health status. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most of all sexually active people will acquire at least one HPV infection in their lifetime. It is important that consumers seek routine dental examinations as a part of their health care to allow for dentists and primary care providers to screen them for this type of cancer, as early detection <b>can</b> <b>mean</b> all <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in treatments. Oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers can occur anywhere in the mouth, but occur most often in the tongue, tonsils, oropharynx (back of the throat), gums and the floor of the mouth. According to the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, [...] "Oropharyngeal cancer is difficult to visualize and is usually located {{at the base of the}} tongue (the back third of the tongue), the soft palate (the back part of the roof of the mouth), the tonsils, and the side and back walls of the throat" [...] and requires a thorough exam by a dental provider or specialist preferably. Men are twice as likely than women to have oral cancer, regardless of race, as African-Americans and Caucasians are equally likely to develop oral cancer.|$|R
