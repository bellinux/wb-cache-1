40|$|Objectives: In {{order to}} {{describe}} treatment options for postoperative benign biliary strictures {{and find a}} proper approach for treatment, we describe the presentation and management of postoperative biliary stricture in 64 patients. Methods: Demographical and clinical data from 64 patients undergoing surgical reconstructions by retrospective methods during the past 6 years were analyzed. Clinical features of Grade I and II group versus Grade III and IV group and bile duct plasty versus biliojejunostomy were compared. Results: Of the 64 patients, 21 received bile duct plasty and the other 43 underwent biliojejunostomy. Patients with bigger bile duct dilatation had better outcomes than those with smaller one, P= 0. 0372. Hepaticojejunostomy was correlated to better outcomes than other surgical procedures, P= 0. 0483. Bile duct plasty was related to Bismuth <b>classification</b> <b>Type</b> I, P= 0. 0001. But biliojejunostomy was related to Bismuth <b>classification</b> <b>Type</b> II, P= 0. 0001 and Type III, P= 0. 0059. Patients with bigger bile duct dilatation had more biliojejunostomy than those with smaller one, P= 0. 0001. Conclusion: Both biliojejunostomy and bile duct plasty had good treatment outcomes. Bile duct plasty should be confined to patients {{with a degree of}} bile duct dilatation less than 1. 5 cm and Bismuth <b>classification</b> (<b>Type</b> I).
