The long-term results of treatment were analyzed and studied in 9 RA patients with synovitis.

40|$|Abstract: Flank milling {{provides}} an {{efficient way to}} machine turbo-machinery components. However, the trajectory smoothness is seldom considered in the existing tool positioning strat-egies. In this paper, the tool trajectory is smoothed with a constraint on the resulting geometric error for five-axis flank milling. Unlike existing methods, this new method simultaneously con-siders the geometric smoothness and geometric deviation. The geometric smoothness is char-acterized by the strain energy of the cutter axis trajectory surface (SA). The geometric deviation is measured by the signed maximal orthogonal distance between the design surface (SD) and the tool envelope surface (SE). For finish and semi-finish flank millings, smooth tool path optimiza-tions are then modelled as multi-objective programming (MOP) problems. Given a prescribed geometric tolerance, the MOP problems are reformulated as constrained nonlinear programming (NLP) problems. Based on the Taylor expansions of the strain energy and the signed distance on the differential deformation of SA, the constrained NLP problems are solved efficiently by the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method. The existence of the optimal solutions is also discussed. The validity of the approach is confirmed by two numerical examples that generate five-axis flank milling tool paths with <b>cylindrical</b> and conical <b>cutters,</b> respectively...|$|R

40|$|For the {{manufacture}} of milled parts, {{it is well known}} that the size of the cutter significantly affects the machining time. However, for small-batch manufacturing, the time spent on loading tools into the tool magazine and establishing z-length compensation values is just as important. If we can select a set of milling tools that will produce good machining time on more than one type of parts, then several unnecessary machine-tool reconfiguration operations can be eliminated. This paper describes a geometric algorithm for finding an optimal set of cutters for machining a set of 2 D parts. In selecting milling cutters we consider both the tool loading time and the machining time and generate solutions that allow us to minimize the total machining time. Our problem formulation addresses the general problem of how to cover a target region to be milled with a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cutter</b> without intersecting with the obstruction region; this definition allows us to handle both open and closed edges in the target region. Our algorithm improves upon previous work in the tool selection area in following ways: (1) in selecting cutters, it accounts for the tool loading time, and (2) it can simultaneously consider multiple different parts and select the optimal set of cutters to minimize the total manufacturing time...|$|E
40|$|Background and aim: The {{volume of}} {{reconstructive}} surgery in traumatology {{in recent decades}} has increased significantly due {{to an increase in}} traumas, numbers of affected in local military conflicts, and environmental deterioration. This has led to an increase in demand for plastic materials, and the need to create modern high technologies to meet this need, including alternative sources of bone implants. Any solution to this problem would involve an in-depth study of bone biophysical properties with innovative techniques to develop requirements to elaboration of new effective implants based on natural bone, as well as on natural or synthetic analogues. This study aimed exactly at these aspects. Materials and methods: We studied human bone samples taken from various parts of the skeleton aged from 3 to 89 years and animal (bovine) bone samples aged from 1. 5 to 2 years. Biophysical characteristics of the studied materials were assessed at the stage of sample preparation with original author's methods of physical and mechanical processing, in the process of analysis of patterns of normal changes in the bone structure and function, as well as during changes in its composition with age, anisotropy of the material and the level of structural organization. Structure patterns were studied by classical (light, scanning electron microscopy) and advanced (acoustic microscopy) techniques. Methods of engineering biomechanics were used to assess functional changes in macro and micro volumes of bone samples. Results: The main study results involve the development of innovative methods of sample preparation and structural and functional analysis. First of all, these are the methods of mechanical processing of bone fragments based on the use of hollow <b>cylindrical</b> milling <b>cutters</b> in the environment of limited amounts of mineralized biological tissues, {{as well as on the}} application of hydrodynamic cutting ensuring a delicate and highly efficient bone cut. Another distinctive feature of the study is the elaborated methodology for morphological and mechanical analysis of bone samples at the macro and micro levels, with consideration of real physical and chemical condition of samples. To ensure sample sterility, the authors proposed innovative techniques using of ozone-oxygen mixtures. The study results gave a  complex of quantitative characteristics describing age-related compositional changes of the human bone, anisotropy of its physical and mechanical characteristics, osteon parameters and physical and mechanical characteristics of bone tissue depending on its composition. Conclusion: The use of the proposed methodology allowed for obtaining of new data on biophysical properties of bone tissue that are of interest for bioimplantology, biomaterial science and expands basic information on the bone as a natural biocomposite. They can be the basis for development of practical guidelines on optimization of the choice of bone fragments for manufacture of implants based on the detected patterns of changes in macro- and microstructure, physical and mechanical characteristics and bone composition in the studied age range...|$|R
40|$|Objects: {{analyze the}} effects of prophy-jet on microhybrid and nano-filled {{composites}} to determine the degree of roughness wich the resins are subjected and consequently discover wich of the two composites {{will be the best}} under the influence of prophy-jet. Materials And Methods: 108 teeth prepared with bovine cervical cavity through <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cutter.</b> The teeth are divided into two groups according to the resin used (Filtek Z 250 microhybrid A, B nano-filled Supreme XT) of 54 elements each. The samples thus prepared are cured for 30 sec and before exposing them to the jet of the Prophy-jet (the teeth are positioned at a distance of 5 mm from the handpiece to be operated in a circular motion) are polished with either diamond burs (10 "ring 10 "yellow then red ring under irrigation) than with discs 3 M Soft lex (four types of wheat from the thickest to thinnest) operated without irrigation and 10 "disc. A polishing finished each group was divided, according to the type of powder used in two groups: α (powder of glycine) and β (aluminum trioxide) which are further divided into three subgroups of 9 teeth each, according to the time of exposure to jet (5 ", 10 "and 15 "). The samples after being exposed to the jet are analyzed using roughness and subjected to statistical analysis. Results: A: α 5 ": 2. 57 "α 10 : 1. 66 α 15 ": 2. 19; β 5 ": 2. 11 "β 10 : 1. 91 β 15 ": 1. 17, mean values: α 2. 10, β 1. 70, mean A: 1. 90, P = 0. 0737. B: α 5 ": 3. 26 "α 10 : 2. 86 α 15 ": 2. 27; β 5 ": 2. 37 "β 10 : 1. 95 β 15 ": 2, 2; average values: α 2. 80, β 2. 20, mean B: 2. 50, P = 0. 0011. Discussions: In group A, α and β are not statistically significant (p = 0. 0737) and in group B, p = 0. 0011 and statistically significant, α ≠ β and the average of all α is greater than β, with the composite B, β (aluminum trioxide), is better than α. A and B are very different, but being the statistical average of A less than B the roughness of A is <B. Dealing with glycine A and B, A is better; trioxide dealing with A and B, A is better. In Guppi A β 15 is among the best, α 5 among the worst. In group B β 10 is the best, α 5 is the worst. Conclusions: With the statistical analysis reveals that a 5 ", especially with glycine, it has greater roughness than 10 "and 15 ". It would appear therefore to sense the polishing power of the Prophy-jet, capable of polishing the composite without damaging it, up to a maximum, in our protocol, 15 ". Thus analyzed the effects in the two groups of composites, one can say that, in this study, A (micro-hybrid) is better than B (nano-filled) ...|$|E
