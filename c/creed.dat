5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was {{defended by}} Sheik Abdul Bashir against Consequences <b>Creed</b> at the spectacle. At Hard Justice, Bashir {{attacked}} <b>Creed</b> with a steal chair during his bout with Petey Williams for the title, which allowed Williams to force Creed's {{head into the}} mat with his signature Canadian Destroyer maneuver to retain the X Division Championship. <b>Creed</b> was given a rematch on the August21 episode of Impact!, with Bashir once again interfering by attacking <b>Creed,</b> resulting in <b>Creed</b> winning by disqualification and Williams retaining the X Division Championship again. A Three Way match for the title with Williams defending against Bashir and <b>Creed</b> was scheduled for No Surrender. At the event, Bashir defeated Williams and <b>Creed</b> to become the new TNA X Division Champion.

5|$|The TNA X Division Championship match followed, with Sheik Abdul Bashir {{defending}} against Consequences <b>Creed.</b> The match lasted 9 {{minutes and}} 18 seconds. Prior to the contest, ring announcer David Penzer introduced Sgt. Daniel Casara, {{who in turn}} introduced <b>Creed.</b> During the bout, Bashir held <b>Creed</b> in a submission hold with the referee attempting to raise Creed's arm three times. If it fell all three times, Bashir would be named the winner. <b>Creed</b> held his arm up on the third try, continuing the match. Bashir won the contest later by pinning <b>Creed</b> with a roll-up pinning maneuver while holding onto the middle rope for leverage. As such, Bashir retained the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E
5|$|They {{team up with}} a {{group called}} the Sweeper Alliance to storm the Apostles of the Stars' island, {{organized}} by Chronos assassin Lin Shaolee in disguise to act as decoys for Chronos' own attack. Separated upon arriving, Train, Sven and Eve each get involved in fights with members of the Apostles, while Chronos, who landed after them, get to <b>Creed</b> first. Sephiria Arks faces off against <b>Creed,</b> but loses. Sven, Eve and Chronos then fight bio-warrior weapons fused with nanotechnology, while Train begins his battle with <b>Creed.</b> <b>Creed</b> has obtained immortality, although he reveals to Train his only weakness; his brain cannot be repaired like the rest of his body. Train defeats <b>Creed</b> using one last full-powered railgun shot to destroy his Imagine Blade and Eve uses her own nanomachines to take those that give <b>Creed</b> immortality out of his body. Train and Sephiria allow <b>Creed</b> to walk away, and the survivors of the Apostles of the Stars are shown on the run or hiding.|$|E

5|$|The Apostles of the Stars launch {{their first}} {{attack on the}} World Summit, killing the leaders from 20 top nations, causing Chronos to declare war on them. Chronos even notify Train of a new Sweeper bounty on <b>Creed</b> {{in order to gain}} his help, though he resists, {{planning}} to go after him on his own terms. Chronos assassin Jenos Hazard is sent to hire Rinslet to gather information on the Apostles, however, this is really in order to use her as bait to lure <b>Creed</b> out of hiding and force Train to get involved, who was lured to the same area via false Sweeper intel. Jenos and the other two members of the special unit Cerebus launch an assault on Creed's lair, that results in it being turned to rubble, while Train simply rescues Rinslet and leaves. <b>Creed</b> then tries to kill Sven, believing he is holding Train back from joining him, but accidentally shoots Train with a nanomachine-enhanced bullet that has the unplanned effect of reverting his body to that of a child. In order to return Train to normal, Train, Sven and Eve visit nanotechnology expert Dr. Tearju, who is also Eve's creator. While there, the Apostles of the Stars attack to force Tearju to join them in order to grant <b>Creed</b> eternal life through nanomachines, but are defeated by a returned Train who can now fire a railgun shot thanks to the nanomachines. However, Eathes was able to copy Tearju, gaining all of her knowledge, and Train, Sven and Eve finally decide {{to put a stop to}} <b>Creed.</b>|$|E

40|$|While {{theology}} usually {{concentrates on}} the history {{and content of the}} Reformational <b>creeds,</b> less systematised information is available about the ministry and service which these <b>creeds</b> should fulfil {{in the life of the}} church as believers. This study points to a consistent continuity in the way confessions of faith were used by the early Christians, the Reformers and in the <b>creeds</b> of the Reformation. The content of the Heidelberg Catechism in particular bears a remarkable correspondence to the tradition in the early churches. <b>Creeds</b> can only be confessions of faith if they communicate the revelation from Scriptures. If <b>creeds</b> function thus, the current widespread indifference to the practical use of even the Heidelberg Catechism in the practical world of the church must be ascribed to the illegitimate distinction which Rationalism draws between practical (or subjective) and doctrinal (or objective) theology...|$|R

Near {{the end of the}} match, Sheik Abdul Bashir walked out to the ring and bashed <b>Creed</b> across the back with a steel chair, which allowed Williams to force Creed's head into the mat with his signature Canadian Destroyer maneuver. Williams followed with the pin to win the match and retain the TNA X Division Championship. After the bout, Bashir continued to attack <b>Creed.</b>|$|E

40|$|Reasons for a comtemporary re-interpretation of <b>creeds.</b> The present {{century has}} seen an {{increasing}} opposition to <b>creeds</b> and doctrinal statements of faith. The {{question for the}} church and theology is how to read the <b>creeds</b> {{in such a way}} that it will not deprive us from our own responsibility to Scripture. In order to do just that a reinterpretation of the <b>creeds</b> is necessary. In this reinterpretation there should be a recognition of historical and cultural relativity. We do not experience our world in the same way as premodern people did. Any attempt to leave ecclesiastical doctrines in an unchangeable form would result in the increasing loss of the meanings of those doctrines...|$|R
