40|$|Index words: Alcoholic and non-alcoholic chronic pancreatitis, {{malnutrition}} {{and consumption}} of Manihot esculenta) Objectives To describe the potential risk factors, clinical features, biochemical and radiological features, and management of chronic calcific pancreatitis. Design Cross-sectional descriptive study. Setting Tertiary care general hospital. Patients Fifty patients with pancreatic calcification referred to the Colombo South Teaching Hospital, and 50 agematched controls from healthy relatives or friends of the patients. Measurement Height and weight measurements, immunoreactive insulin levels and trypsin levels of duodenal aspirates were estimated. Plain abdominal xray and ultrasonography were performed. Intervention Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) was attempted on all patients during which duodenal aspirates were collected. Success rates of ERCP and response to endotherapeutic procedures were recorded. Results Twenty two of the 50 chronic calcific pancreatitis (CP) patients were diagnosed to have chronic alcoholic calcific pancreatitis (CACP). Mean age of the CACP patients {{was significantly higher than}} that of the chronic calcific pancreatitis of the tropics (CCPT) patients. Severe malnutrition (BMI < 20), frequent consumption of Manihot esculenta (manioc, cassava) and a high consumption of <b>chilli</b> <b>or</b> <b>pepper</b> were identified as possible risk factors for both alcoholic and non-alcoholic CP. Onset of diabetes occurred at a much younger age in the CCPT group than in the CACP group. Mean serum insulin was significantly higher in the CCPT group than in the CACP group and duodenal trypsin level was significantly lower in the CCPT than in CACP group. Conclusions Our results confirm the existence of both alcoholic (CACP) and non-alcoholic (CCPT) types of chronic calcific pancreatitis in Sri Lanka. A larger study is required to confirm the associated risk factors such as Manihot esculenta and foods with a high content of <b>chilli</b> <b>or</b> <b>pepper...</b>|$|E

Hense, a field investigation carried out at three environments viz., Balajigapade - Chikkaballapur (E 1), Department of Horticulture GKVK, UAS, Bengaluru (E 2) and K- block, Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding GKVK, UAS, Bengaluru (E 3) to assess the promising hybrids for yield stability pattern and its components during kharif 2014 - 15. Twenty-five test hybrids were evaluated with three standard checks (KBCH- 1, Arka Meghana and Arka Haritha) in Randomized Complete Block Design and each treatment was replicated twice. Out of three environments studied E 3 was found to be the most suitable location for expression of many bio-physical characters. Significance of variance due to hybrid X environment (linear) was evident for green fruit yield. Variance due to environment (linear) was highly significant for all the traits across three environments indicating considerable differences among environments and their predominant effect in the expression of all the traits. The hybrid CMS 10 A X Byadgi-Kaddi exhibited higher mean with unit regression co-efficient and non-significant S 2 di different from zero indicating specifically adapted to unfavorable environment for average fruit weight and fruit width. The hybrids CMS 10 A X LCA- 206 and CMS 10 A X Gouribidanur were found specifically adopted to favorable environments for green fruit yield, red fruit yield, average fruits/plant and average fruit length...|$|R

40|$|Capsaicinoids are {{responsible}} for the sharp, burning taste of certain fruits used as spices or vegetables, such as capsicum <b>or</b> <b>chilli</b> <b>peppers.</b> Capsaicinoids are e. g. capsaicin, dihydro-capsaicin, nordihydrocapsaicin. Capsaicin usually accounts for two-thirds to three-quarters of the total capsaicinoid conten [. ] The BfR {{came to the conclusion that}} the oral intake of chilli fruits and preparations thereof on their own or as ingredients of hot to very hot dishes, such as those traditionally consumed in African, Arab, South American and Asian cuisine within the scope of the internationally ac-cepted consumption, does not lead to any acute health effects. However, intolerances due to allergies are known. The BfR is assuming that the degree of hotness traditionally accepted by adults in the course of one meal equates to a maximum of one 5 mg dose of capsaicin per kg of body weight. This would correspond to an intake of 300 mg of capsaicin in one meal by an adult weighing 60 kg. Serious health impairments have been observed with an excessively high consumption of chillies <b>or</b> <b>chilli</b> preparations. For the described undesired effects, such as irritation of mucous membranes, nausea, vomiting, hypertension, however, the dosage of capsaicinoids in-gested by affected persons is unknown. In particular, children may react sensitively to hot chilli products. Severe poisoning cases of in small children after ingestion of chilli prepara-tions are described in international literature. On the basis of the available data, the BfR recommends that chilli and other spicy sauces (concentrations of more than 100 mg of capsaicin per kilogram of food (0. 1 %)) should be labelled accordingly and that childproof closures should be applied to packaging. The BfR also recommends that the responsible food controlling authorities should check products with a capsaicin concentration of more than 6000 mg per kilogram on a case-by-case basis to establish whether they can be regarded as safe foods [. ...|$|R
