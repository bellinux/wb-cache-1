Initially, the rocks are {{smoothed}} with a <b>coarse</b> <b>grit</b> (such as 60-90 mesh).

[...] This is followed by washing and then a stage of finer grits (120-220 then 400-600 mesh), before the (optional) use of a pre-polishing compound (1200 grit), a washing cycle with detergent to remove any grit on the stones. [...] The final step is a polishing stage using powdered polish, (such as cerium oxide or tin oxide), water, and often small plastic pellets that are designed to cushion the stones as they tumble (so as not to cause chipping) and carry the polish evenly across the stones.|$|E
50|$|The {{grit size}} of {{sandpaper}} is usually stated {{as a number}} that is inversely related to the particle size. A small number such as 20 or 40 indicates a <b>coarse</b> <b>grit,</b> while a large number such as 1500 indicates a fine grit.|$|E

30|$|The {{abrasive}} grit size {{has a major}} influence on the surface roughness and the surface finish, the improvement by using a smaller grit size abrasive is significant. During grinding, only a small top region of the {{abrasive grit}}s is efficient for metal removal, the remaining part is sliding and rubbing the workpiece material (Sin et al. 1979). The <b>coarser</b> <b>grit</b> size abrasives have bigger abrasive particles, causing larger areas of rubbing during grinding; meanwhile, the size and distribution of the abrasive grit grains are more uneven in <b>coarser</b> <b>grit</b> size abrasives; thus, more defects and a worse surface finish have been induced by using <b>coarser</b> <b>grit</b> size abrasives.|$|R

50|$|Coarse threads {{are those}} with larger pitch (fewer threads per axial distance), and fine threads are those with smaller pitch (more threads per axial distance). Coarse threads {{have a larger}} threadform {{relative}} to screw diameter, where fine threads have a smaller threadform relative to screw diameter.

50|$|Whetstones may {{be natural}} or {{artificial}} stones. Artificial stones usually {{come in the}} form of a bonded abrasive composed of a ceramic such as silicon carbide (carborundum) or of aluminium oxide (corundum). Bonded abrasives provide a faster cutting action than natural stones. They are commonly available as a double-sided block with a <b>coarse</b> <b>grit</b> on one side and a fine grit on the other enabling one stone to satisfy the basic requirements of sharpening. Some shapes are designed for specific purposes such as sharpening scythes, drills or serrations.|$|E

There really is no need to add crockery {{to the bottom of the}} pot, but you may want to add a small square of wire mesh or other permiable fabric over hole in bottom of pot. Potting Epiphytic Orchids Epiphytes prefer conditions where roots can be exposed, therefore, tight pots and close-contact soil mixes do not work well and will induce rot. Mix 3 parts dust-free, medium-grade bark, 1 part <b>coarse</b> <b>grit</b> or perlite, 1 part charcoal, and 1 part peat moss together, OR use a commercial orchid mix. As with the terrestrial orchid, select a pot that will accommodate roots and about 2 years growth, but no more. Make sure {{that it has a}} drainage hole. Even better, select an orchid pot, which has vertical slits down sides. Hold orchid over pot so that crown is just below the rim of the pot. With other hand, fill pot with moistened bark mix, tamping to firm. Some epiphytes do not need to be potted and prefer to grow on a mound or slab of bark. Until roots attach, tie orchid in place with fishing line. Constant humidity is a must. Support Orchids that have long flower stalks will need staking. Staking is best done as stem grows and before buds open. Many growers prefer to insert stake when potting orchid, but it is up to you.|$|E

40|$|International audienceInterface {{conditions}} are of prime importance for implant fixation {{in the early}} post-operative period and modelling of specific biochemical interactions at implant surface is still missing. We hypothesized that updating osteoblast adhesion properties and growth factor source in an active zone located at the implant surface was relevant to model biochemical interactions of implant with its environment. We proposed an innovative set of diffusive-convective-reactive equations which relevant parameters were the cell decay factor, the cell motility, and the growth factor balance. Initial comparison with histomorphometic results from a stable PMMA canine implant model provided an encouraging base to implement a numerical sensitivity analysis to evaluate the role of three types of bioactive surfaces: acid-etched titanium, <b>coarse</b> <b>grit</b> blasted acid-etched titanium and <b>coarse</b> <b>grit</b> blasted acid-etched titanium with RGDS peptide. We found that cell diffusion decrease (acid-etched + RGDS peptide vs. PMMA), and increase of local growth factor fraction (PMMA vs. acid-etched + RGDS peptide), significantly improved the amount of mineralized tissue on the implant surface. When the variation of structural fraction to cell motility and growth factor synthesis was investigated, an envelope pattern with an optimum was obtained but this could be exceeded for strong surface modifications and/or for high growth factor concentrations. The model also confirmed that implant bioactive properties should play a limited role to reduce heterogeneity of new-formed tissue. In conclusion, we suggested that our innovative theoretical approach was relevant to investigate implant fixation and could potentially help in reduction of implant revision...|$|E

MétodosForam preparados 60 discos em resina bis‐acrílica, 30 com Protemp‐ 4 e 30 com Structur‐ 3. As faces dos discos foram limpas com álcool e os espécimes divididos em 12 grupos experimentais (n= 5), de acordo com tipo de resina e método de polimento (sem tratamento adicional; escova pelo‐de‐cabra; disco de grão grosso Sof‐Lex seguido de escova pelo‐de‐cabra; sequência de discos Sof‐Lex; disco de grão grosso Sof‐Lex seguido de aplicação de Fortify; disco de grão grosso Sof‐Lex seguido de Z‐Prime Plus). Sessenta minutos após o polimento foi realizada a medição de cor inicial (CIE L*a*b*) e os espécimes foram imersos em café. Após 24 horas e 7 dias de imersão foram {{realizadas}} novas medições de cor. A diferença cromática foi calculada com a fórmula ΔE*=[(ΔL*) 2 +(Δa*) 2 +(Δb*) 2] 1 / 2. Os dados foram analisados com testes estatísticos segundo os métodos de Kruskal‐Wallis, Mann‐Whitney e Wilcoxon (alfa= 0, 05). ResultadosOs valores ΔE variaram entre 4, 9 ‐ 11, 7 (24 horas) e 13, 3 ‐ 21, 4 (7 dias). O aumento do tempo de imersão do bis‐acrílico no café conduziu a aumento de ΔE (p< 0, 001). Às 24 horas não se encontraram diferenças entre os materiais (p= 0, 941). Ao fim de 7 dias o Protemp‐ 4 mostrou valores ΔE (p= 0, 032) inferiores aos obtidos com a Structur‐ 3. Com exceção do Protemp‐ 4 com 7 dias de imersão, a ΔE foi influenciada pelo método de polimento (p< 0, 05). ConclusãoTodos os espécimes apresentaram valores de ΔE considerados clinicamente inaceitáveis. AbstractAimTo {{study the}} effect of several polishing techniques and exposure time to a staining agent on the color stability of two bis‐acrylic resins. Methods 60 cylindrical specimens of bis‐acrylic were prepared, 30 with Protemp‐ 4 and 30 with Strutur‐ 3. Both sides of specimens were cleaned with alcohol and the specimens were allocated to 12 experimental groups (n= 5) according to the material and surface treatment performed (without any other treatment, goat hair brushes, Sof‐Lex <b>coarser</b> <b>grit</b> disc followed by goat hair brushes, Sof‐Lex sequence, Sof‐Lex <b>coarser</b> <b>grit</b> disc with Fortify, Sof‐Lex <b>coarser</b> <b>grit</b> disc with Z‐Prime Plus). Sixty minutes after polishing, the baseline colour values (CIE L*a*b*) were measured, and all the specimens were immersed in the staining solution (coffee). After 24 hours and 7 days additional measurements were taken. Colour changes were calculated by the formula: ΔE*=[(ΔL*) 2 +(Δa*) 2 +(Δb*) 2] 1 / 2. All data were statistically analysed by non‐parametric tests according to Kruskal‐Wallis, Mann‐Whitney and Wilcoxon methods (alpha= 0. 05). ResultsΔE mean values ranged between 4. 9 and 11. 7 after 24 hours of immersion and between 13. 3 and 21. 4 after 7 days. Increasing the immersion time in the staining solution led to an increase of ΔE values (p< 0. 001). After 24 hours of immersion, there were no statistical differences among materials (p= 0. 941). After 7 days of immersion, Protemp‐ 4 obtained lower ΔE (p= 0. 032) than Structur‐ 3. The ΔE {{was influenced by the}} polishing technique, except for Protemp‐ 4 after 7 days of immersion (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Ultra-precision surface {{grinding}} experiments were conducted at two different grinding conditions (rough and fine) {{to study the}} surface finish of RB-SiC/Si and WC/Co carbides, with Si and Co as binders, respectively. It was found that RB-SiC/Si and WC/Co showed {{two different types of}} surface generation mechanism under the same selected grinding conditions: brittle fractured surface of RB-SiC/Si and plastic deformation surface of WC/Co. Obvious micro-breaks occurred on SiC surface with a <b>coarse</b> <b>grit</b> wheel at higher material removal rate, but it changed to micro-pits at the phase boundary with a fine grit wheel at a lower material removal rate. Nevertheless, the surface characteristic only changed from rough grinding traces to finer for WC/Co.

The surface roughness (Ra) of RB-SiC/Si was limited to be about 20 nm under both rough and fine grinding conditions while about 5 nm (Ra) could be achieved for WC/Co under the fine condition. It was also identified that the surface profile of workpieces was replicated from diamond grits.

Adopting two-dimensional ultrasonic composite processing, {{the influences of}} grinding depth, worktable velocity, wheel granularity on the surface roughness of Al 2 O 3 /ZrO 2 ceramic nanocomposites were described. Experimental results of AFM microstructure show that the material removal model in WTDUVG is dominated by ductile flow of material, some crystal refinement, the crush powder and grain pull-out are visible and {{there is almost no}} fracture. Furthermore, the surface roughness in WTDUVG with <b>coarse</b> <b>grit</b> is about 30 40 % less than that in CG under identical grinding condition; the qualitative analysis of X-diffraction results indicated that the surface phases are composed of α-Al 2 O 3, t-ZrO 2 and small quality m-ZrO 2, there are amorphous phase in the surface both with and without vibration grinding. M-zirconia phase transitions rule in vibration and conventional grinding was found. Under definitive grinding conditions, the material removal mechanism of inelastic deformation is the principal removal mechanism of Al 2 O 3 /ZrO 2 ceramic nanocomposites, the grit size of diamond wheel and vibration grinding mode have important influence on material removal mechanism of ceramic nanocomposites...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the biaxial flexural strength (BFS) of a CAD/CAM leucite reinforced glass-ceramic ground by diamond burs of different grit sizes and the influence of surface roughness on the BFS. For this, 104 plates were obtained from CAD/CAM ceramic blocks and divided into 4 groups (n = 26), according to bur grit size: extra-fine, fine, medium and coarse. Roughness parameters (Ra, RyMax) were measured, and plates were kept dry for 7 days. The flexural test was carried out and BFS was calculated. Ra, RyMax and BFS data were subjected to analysis of variance and post-hoc test. Weibull analysis was used to compare characteristic strength and Weibull modulus. Regression analysis was performed for BFS vs. Ra and RyMax. When burs with <b>coarse</b> <b>grit</b> were used, higher surface roughness values were found, causing a negative effect on the ceramic BFS (117 MPa for extra-fine, and 83 MPa for coarse). Correlation (r) between surface roughness and BFS was 0. 78 for RyMax and 0. 73 for Ra. Increases in diamond grit size have a significant negative effect on the BFS of leucite-reinforced glass-ceramics, suggesting that grinding of sintered glass-ceramic should be performed using burs with the finest grit possible in order to minimize internal surface flaws and maximize flexural strength...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to obtain the basic {{knowledge}} on acoustic emission (AE) characteristics in wood sanding process. In sanding parallel and perpendicular to the grain, the AE event count rate decreased with increasing sanding time and this tendency was similar to the variation of stock removal rate with sanding time. The amplitude distribution of AE signal showed a tendency that the AE event count rates were greater for lower threshold voltage and they decreased with increasing threshold voltage. Although the AE event count rates were greater in lower threshold voltage for finer grit size, they decreased with increasing sanding time at each threshold voltage. Both the AE event count rate and the amplitude distribution of AE signal in sanding perpendicular to the grain were greater and wider than these values in sanding parallel to the grain, respectively. It was found that the AEs with low amplitude were greater for finer grit size and the AEs with high amplitude were greater for <b>coarser</b> <b>grit</b> size.

Acylglycerols form part of the neutral lipid fraction. Free fatty acids (FFAs), Also called non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), fatty acids that are not esterified to glycerol or another alcohol such as choline or cholesterol. In blood plasma or serum, FFAs are really not free but bound to plasma albumin. Locust bean, Properly the fruit of the African locust bean tree (Parkia filicoidea) but the name is frequently applied to the fruit of the carob tree (Ceratonia siliqua). The latter originated in the eastern Mediterranean region and is also found in the subtropics. The fruits are thick, fleshy (more so in the carob) pods each containing about a dozen seeds. The seeds are tough and must be crushed before feeding. The resulting meal has a high sugar and energy content and is very palatable but is low in protein (42 - 54 g kg- 1). Oyster Shell, Oyster shells are almost pure calcium carbonate (95 - 99 %) and are good sources of calcium for all classes of animals. Clam shells, conch shells, coral and coral sand can all be used for feeding. Shells that have been ground to <b>coarse</b> <b>grit</b> tend to be more palatable to laying hens and help grain digestion in the gizzard, as well as producing strong eggshells.
