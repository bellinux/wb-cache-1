40|$|Basic theory {{suggests}} that multinational enterprises (MNEs) succeed when they develop knowledgebased capabilities, often called firm-specific advantages (FSAs). In China’s case its large MNEs have few such knowledge based FSAs. Instead, they are building scale economies based on China’s country-specific advantages (CSAs) in relatively cheap labor and natural resources. Thus, <b>China’s</b> MNEs <b>will</b> likely become knowledge seekers as they go abroad, not knowledge takers. Unlike Western MNEs who transfer knowledge and technology through their FSAs, <b>China’s</b> MNEs <b>will</b> lack such FSAs for some years to come. While <b>China’s</b> MNEs <b>will</b> have difficulty in sustaining their initial forays abroad, {{it is likely that}} they will expand intra-regionally rather than globally and in a similar manner to other large multinationals...|$|R
