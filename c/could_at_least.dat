When black postmasters at Hogansville, Georgia in 1897, and at Lake City, South Carolina the following year, were assaulted, McKinley issued no statement of condemnation. Although black leaders criticized McKinley for inaction, supporters responded by saying there was little the president could do to intervene. Critics replied by saying that he <b>could</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> publicly condemn such events, as Harrison had done.|$|E

The next morning at 08:30 they arrived at Deir El Belah, where the division was now located. Casualties during the battle had again been rather light, at one dead and nineteen wounded.

5|$|H. pylori is a {{major cause}} of certain {{diseases}} of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Rising antibiotic resistance increases the need to search for new therapeutic strategies; this might include prevention in the form of vaccination. Much work has been done on developing viable vaccines aimed at providing an alternative strategy to control H. pylori infection and related diseases, including stomach cancer. Researchers are studying different adjuvants, antigens, and routes of immunization to ascertain the most appropriate system of immune protection; however, most of the research only recently moved from animal to human trials. An economic evaluation of the use of a potential H. pylori vaccine in babies found its introduction <b>could,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> in the Netherlands, prove cost-effective for the prevention of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer. A similar approach has also been studied for the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{dive bomber}} wing {{supported}} Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps in its two-year campaign in North Africa; its other main task was attacking Allied shipping. In 1941, Ju 87 operations in North Africa {{were dominated by}} the Siege of Tobruk, which lasted for over seven months. It served during the Battle of Gazala and the First Battle of El Alamein, {{as well as the}} decisive Second Battle of El Alamein, which drove Rommel back to Tunisia. As the tide turned and Allied air power grew in the autumn of 1942, the Ju 87 became very vulnerable and losses were heavy. The entry of the Americans into North Africa during Operation Torch made the situation far worse; the Stuka was obsolete in what was now a fighter-bomber's war. The Bf 109 and Fw 190 <b>could</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> fight enemy fighters on equal terms after dropping their ordnance but the Stuka could not. The Ju 87's vulnerability was demonstrated on 11 November 1942, when 15 Ju 87 Ds were shot down by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Curtiss P-40Fs in minutes.|$|E

25|$|Dark matter {{can refer}} to any {{substance}} which interacts predominantly via gravity with visible matter (e.g. stars and planets).

However, for the reasons outlined below, most scientists consider the dark matter to be dominated by a non-baryonic component, which is likely composed of a currently unknown fundamental particle (or similar exotic state).|$|E

From the elevated fighting platform the hillside could be better controlled than from the fighting positions lower down. The bergfried usually also served generally as a fortified tower. Examples of very high bergfrieds were or are those at Rheinfels Castle (54 m) and the Osterburg (53 m). Additional chemins de ronde (walkways behind the battlements) could be built on the lower storeys of a tower (e.g. Bischofstein Castle on the Moselle).|$|E

These included Scott Donnelly to Swansea City and winger Kirk Hudson to League One side Brentford. Manager Kevin Dillon {{brought in a}} total of 11 new signings to the club, most notably experienced midfielder Glen Little from Sheffield United and Northampton Town's Luke Guttridge. On the pitch, Aldershot had several promising results in pre-season friendlies, including wins over Championship side Bristol City and League One Colchester. Confidence was high that the club <b>could</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> match the previous season's 6th-placed finish, Dillon believing that the new squad could be more competitive in the division.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though this}} solar {{technology}} {{may have a}} higher starting cost than that of conventional fossil fuel, the low maintenance and operation cost {{and the ability to}} operate without fuel makes the solar powered systems cheaper to keep running. A small rural community could use a system like this indefinitely, and it would provide clean drinking water at a negligible cost after the initial equipment purchase and setup. In a larger community, it <b>could</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> contribute to the water supply and reduce pressures of daily survival.

25|$|Irish law {{recognised}} {{a number}} of classes, from unfree to king, which were ranked within the status tracts.

However, the laws discuss slaves, both male and female, and the term for a female slave, Cumhall, became a broader currency term. As unfree, slaves could not be legal agents either for themselves or others. In addition to the wholly unfree, a few individuals were semi-free.

25|$|After Madson retired {{all three}} Cubs he faced {{in the top}} of the eighth, the Nationals staged their final rally in the bottom of the inning. Joe Maddon had called in Cubs closer Wade Davis to get the last out of the seventh inning and kept him in to pitch the eighth and ninth in the hope that he would get a seven-out save, an unusually long outing for him. Davis started the eighth by walking Daniel Murphy and Anthony Rendon, but then got pinch-hitter Adam Lind to ground into a double play that {{advanced}} Murphy to third. Michael A. Taylor then singled to drive in Murphy and cut Chicago's lead to 9-8, and light-hitting catcher José Lobatón who had replaced Wieters in the game, singled, advancing Taylor to second. With Davis clearly tiring and the top of the Nationals′ order coming to bat, Washington′s hopes rose that they <b>could</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> tie the game. Trea Turner came to the plate and had worked his at-bat to a 2-1 count when catcher Willson Contreras threw to first to pick off Lobatón. Lobatón was called safe, but the Cubs challenged the call and the video replay revealed that Lobatón′s foot had lost contact with the bag for less than a second while Anthony Rizzo was applying the tag. Lobatón was ruled out, and the inning ended.|$|E
