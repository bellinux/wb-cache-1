5000|$|Toowoomba Airport [...] is {{an airport}} located [...] {{northwest}} from the CBD of Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia. Toowoomba Airport is officially known as Toowoomba City Aerodrome and is both licensed and certified. The aerodrome is {{owned and operated}} by Toowoomba Regional Council. Being certified means the airfield is able to have airlines and larger charter aircraft operate from the aerodrome. Being licensed means that the aerodrome is regulated by federal transport security regulations. Toowoomba Aerodrome does not have a control tower, however the airfield is regulated and operated under Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) regulations of aviation operations at non-tower <b>controlled</b> <b>aerodromes.</b>|$|R
50|$|FISOs most usually {{work in an}} {{aerodrome control}} tower, {{providing}} a flight information service to aircraft in the local area, and on the ground, and therefore require similar equipment and commanding views of an air traffic control tower at a quiet <b>controlled</b> <b>aerodrome.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Invercargill Airport [...] is a <b>{{controlled}}</b> <b>aerodrome</b> located 1 nmi km west of {{the city}} centre of Invercargill {{at the bottom of}} the South Island of New Zealand. It is the southernmost controlled airport in the Commonwealth. Formed on land reclaimed from the Waihopai/New River Estuary in 1938, the airport was prone to flooding, notably in 1984 when it was inoperable for two months. The Invercargill City Council considered moving the airport back to Dawson Farm, Myross Bush, the original site up to 1942. Instead, a large flood protection scheme was built, but during its construction heavy rain and an unusually high tidal surge flooded it again in 1987.There have been no problems since. The airport has a single terminal and 4 tarmac gates.|$|E
50|$|The aerodrome {{is owned}} by the local {{government}} and used for pioneer flight operations. The coordinates are 00 47 North, 114 34 East. The elevation is not officially published, only measured from the aircraft altimeter, which is about 650 ft above sea level. The runway designation is 02 and 20. The length of the runway is 750 meter with width of 23 meter. A stopway of 30 meter is provided for runway 02. The runway surface is asphalt and its strength can accommodate up to CASA 212 aircraft. It has an apron, taxiway, but a tower building is not available since the aerodrome is a non <b>controlled</b> <b>aerodrome.</b> The runway is not equipped with landing direction indicators and, due to local prevailing surface winds at most of the time, the preferred takeoff and landing direction is runway 02. A significant obstacle is the hilly forest in the northerly direction of the extension of runway 02. The first obstacle is about 200 feet high above runway elevation located about 533.3 meters from the end of runway 02, and the second obstacle is about 500 feet above runway elevation 1.262,9 meters from the end of runway 02. Runway slope inclination is 3% from direction of runway 02.|$|E
50|$|There {{is also a}} Type K ARCAL (Aircraft Radio <b>Control</b> of <b>Aerodrome</b> Lighting) system. However, the PAPI are not {{available}} with this system and can only be operated manually by a person at the airport.|$|R

50|$|Pilot-controlled {{lighting}} (PCL), {{also known}} as aircraft radio <b>control</b> of <b>aerodrome</b> lighting (ARCAL) or pilot-activated lighting (PAL), is a system which allows aircraft pilots to control the lighting of an airport or airfield's approach lights, edge lights, and taxiways via radio. At some airfields, the aerodrome beacon may also be ARCAL controlled. ARCAL is most common at non-towered or little-used airfields where it is neither economical to light the runways all night, nor to provide staff to turn the runway lighting on and off. It enables pilots to control the lighting only when required, saving electricity and reducing light pollution.|$|R

This paper describes the CARA technique, including the data used for quantification, and the types of air traffic controller behaviours it quantifies, and the performance shaping factors it uses to modify task reliability. In order to evaluate CARA, it was applied in three actual ATM safety cases. The three safety cases related to an aircraft landing guidance system, a position/identity display for the air traffic <b>control</b> (ATC) <b>aerodrome</b> environment and an aerodrome procedure for low visibility conditions using future ATC systems.

40|$|The {{air traffic}} control system is a vast network of people and {{necessary}} navigational equipment that ensures the safe operation of commercial and private aircraft throughout the world. Air traffic controller service is responsible for area, approach and <b>aerodrome</b> <b>control.</b> Aircraft fatal accident data for commercial jet airplanes between 1959 and 2008 show that 36 % of the accidents happen in the final approach and landing phase, possibly due to mechanical failure or human error resulting from poor communication between the pilot and {{air traffic control}}ler. This paper presents an integration of a radar system with a GPS-based Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) for approach control separation between all instrument flight rules (IFR) flights and between IFR flights and visual flight rules (VFR) flights operated as controlled flights. The integration is simulated using MATLAB. Results of the simulation show that aircraft separation is easier and safer than relying only on an air traffic controller. We note, however, that the service of air traffic controllers is still required for successful <b>aerodrome</b> <b>control...</b>|$|R
5000|$|At some non-radar airports, the {{procedural}} approach {{may be combined}} with <b>aerodrome</b> <b>control,</b> thus providing a control service for all aircraft at the airport, and all inbound and outbound flights within its terminal airspace.

Also, the aircraft's control system was inadequate to allow quick pilot responses, and it had no method of lateral <b>control,</b> and the <b>Aerodromes</b> aerial stability was marginal.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Laser {{detection}} and tracking of aircrafts based systems (LIDARs, LIgth Detection And Ranging systems) are {{emerging as a}} critical design trend in development of new generation ATM (Air Traffic Management) paradigms, {{of which they are}} the main innovations. The realization of laser sensors as rotating laser range-finder arrays and their combination to versatile systems lead to major advantages for the application such as Air Traffic <b>Control</b> within <b>Aerodrome</b> Traffic Zone (ATZ), airport surveillance and ground to air laser communications, and last but not least to save cost usually at the same time with getting an improved ATC (Air Traffic Control) performance. These laser systems that today can be developed without particular difficulties are challenging classical ATM paradigms in many aspects. Nevertheless, it is commonly recognized that the effectiveness of these systems strictly relies on the capability to reliably perform a track data fusion with airpor...|$|R

50|$|Following the {{cessation}} of hostilities, <b>control</b> of the <b>aerodrome</b> {{was transferred to the}} Department of Civil Aviation on 31 July 1946. There were 127 buildings on site at its peak and all those not needed by Civil Aviation needs were processed for disposal. Civil Aviation elected to retain the hospital, motor transport garages, two hangars, a flight office, a workshop, store, inflammables store and two latrines. One of the hangars was later removed, though most of the selected buildings remain on site. Some concrete slabs and other traces of RAAF buildings can still be seen dotted about the airport.

Two feedback loops are considered to influence the controllers monitoring behavior: The accessibility of the information of the “far-view” and controller strategies. The results show that both variables have a crucial influence on how often the controller updates the information of one airport.

40|$|Various {{countries}} {{today are}} actively seeking {{concept of the}} future complex equipment to provide information support for the control and dispatch services of regional airports and small aircraft aerodromes. This {{is due to the}} general trend towards the air traffic intensification, especially that of small aircrafts, as well for economic reasons to reduce the cost of info-dispatching system of regional airports compared with the large airports. Radars for different-purpose are the most universal and all-weather information sensors for <b>aerodrome</b> <b>control</b> services. For regional airports where air traffic is low, the use of information and dispatching systems based on radars, air-field surveillance radars, and approach radars is unreasonably expensive. For the last few years, optoelectronic information systems for info-dispatching systems of regional airports have been developing. When using the optoelectronic information systems at the regional aerodromes in our country there are problems of ensuring the full operation of the airport systems in adverse weather conditions (snow, rain, fog) and a lack of the independent control of the aircraft flight in the airport control zone. Development of new technologies in radar enabled us to design a highly informative radarand-optical complex to accept the challenges of the all-weather information sensor in control and dispatching system of regional airports. This complex, {{for the first time in}} the aerodrome radars, uses two branches of the ultra-wideband signal technology together, namely: very short pulse radar (VSPR) technology and that of the wideband inter-pulse signals and integration with optoelectronic systems. Integration of passive optical-electronic and radar channels allowed us to raise the accuracy of determining the angular coordinates at small ranges, where they are most important. However, since so far there were no complexes, such as “D-RLS”, the existing regulatory documents do not reflect their functions and capabilities and, therefore, there is a need to revise existing, or introduce new regulatory documents to ensure air traffic <b>control</b> in regional <b>aerodromes.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes a}} concept of operation for the tactical guidance of an RPAS by air traffic controllers for selected scenarios. The goal is to give a most flexible guideline how RPAS can be integrated in the existing ATM environment {{and how they can}} be treated by ATC including <b>aerodrome</b> <b>control</b> as well as approach / area control. To provide a complete picture, the provision of (aerodrome) flight information service in an uncontrolled environment is also considered as these services are very close to ATC. The effects, constraints and procedures related to segregated airspaces are also included. After considering and analyzing all existing ATC tasks and procedures, operational needs for the safe and realistic RPAS integration are derived. On the other hand, this document provides a collection of procedures and/or modifications to the existing ATM environment to enable non-segregated RPAS operations or enhance segregated RPAS operations.

The airfield had been evacuated by the RAF fighter squadron stationed there and No. 24 Squadron were tasked with saving what aircraft and equipment they could. Two fighters were patched up and flown back to England. All remaining Hurricanes had been cannibalised, leaving one in flying condition. With no pilot available, Strange took off in an aircraft type he had never flown before, unarmed, and {{with most of the}} instruments missing. Anti-aircraft fire forced Strange up to 8000 ft and the lone fighter was then attacked by several Bf 109s. Surprised by the sound of machine-gun fire, Strange dived the Hurricane to tree-top height and successfully escaped. A month later he was awarded a bar to his Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|R
