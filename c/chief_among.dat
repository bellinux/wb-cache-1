5|$|Frank Marshall {{invented the}} Modern Benoni in 1927, but his {{experiments}} {{with the opening}} went largely ignored for over 20 years. In the 1950s the system was revitalized by players in the Soviet Union, <b>chief</b> <b>among</b> them Mikhail Tal. Its subsequent adoption by players of a similarly aggressive and uncompromising style such as Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov established the opening's {{reputation as one of}} Black's most dynamic responses to 1.d4.|$|E

5|$|Security {{concerns}} dominated Soviet decisions {{concerning the}} Far East. <b>Chief</b> <b>among</b> these was gaining unrestricted {{access to the}} Pacific Ocean. The year-round ice-free areas of the Soviet Pacific coastline—Vladivostok in particular—could be blockaded by air and sea from Sakhalin island and the Kurile Islands. Acquiring these territories, thus guaranteeing free access to the Soya Strait, was their primary objective. Secondary objectives were leases for the Chinese Eastern Railway, Southern Manchuria Railway, Dairen, and Port Arthur.|$|E
5|$|Stevens {{introduced}} a Tenure of Office Act, restricting Johnson from firing officials {{who had received}} Senate confirmation without getting that body's consent. The Tenure of Office Act was ambiguous, since it could be read to protect officeholders only during the tenure of the president who appointed them, {{and most of the}} officials the radicals sought to protect had been named by Lincoln. <b>Chief</b> <b>among</b> these was Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a radical himself.|$|E

All were plagued by problems, <b>chief</b> <b>among</b> them their tendency to derail.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the whiskey tax, westerners {{had a number of}} other grievances with the national government, <b>chief</b> <b>among</b> which was the perception that the government was not adequately protecting the residents living in western frontier. The Northwest Indian War was going badly for the United States, with major losses in 1791. Furthermore, westerners were prohibited by Spain (which then owned Louisiana) from using the Mississippi River for commercial navigation. Until these issues were addressed, westerners felt that the government was ignoring their security and economic welfare. Adding the whiskey excise to these existing grievances only increased tensions on the frontier.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the rulers}} of Europe, such as Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, viewed the {{revolution}} in France as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. The French Republican position became increasingly difficult. Compounding problems in international relations, French émigrés continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution abroad. <b>Chief</b> <b>among</b> them were the Prince Condé, his son, the Duke de Bourbon, and his grandson, the Duke d'Enghien.

5|$|Macedonia {{during the}} reign of Philip II was at first preoccupied by wars with marauding Illyrians and Thracians. <b>Chief</b> <b>among</b> Philip's Thracian enemies was the ruler Kersebleptes, who may have coordinated a {{temporary}} alliance with Athens. In a series of campaigns stretching from 356 to 340 BC, Philip II managed to ultimately subjugate Kersebleptes as a tributary vassal, conquering much of Thrace in the process and founding new cities there such as Philippi (modern Filippoi, Greece) and Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv, Bulgaria). Philip II also fought against the Illyrian king Bardylis, who threatened Macedonia proper, and against Grabos and Pleuratus in Illyria (centred in modern-day Albania).|$|E

5|$|On February 13, it was {{announced}} that the Amaury Sport Organisation would not invite Astana to any of their races that season, which included the Tour de France, Paris–Nice, and numerous one-day races. The decision was made because of the doping perpetrated by Astana in its previous seasons; <b>chief</b> <b>among</b> these scandals was the blood doping perpetrated by Alexander Vinokourov in the 2007 Tour de France. The team reacted with surprise and disappointment, particularly since the ban seemed to punish a team that no longer existed, and as a result Contador {{would not be able to}} defend his Tour de France championship.|$|E
5|$|The French Republican {{position}} {{became increasingly}} difficult. Compounding problems in international relations, French émigrés continued to agitate for {{support of a}} counter-revolution abroad. <b>Chief</b> <b>among</b> them were the Prince Condé, his son, the Duke de Bourbon, and his grandson, the Duke d'Enghien. From their base in Koblenz, adjacent to the French-German border, they sought direct support for military intervention from the royal houses of Europe, and raised an army. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria. In this War of the First Coalition (1792–1798), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Frank Fetter {{was born}} in Peru, Indiana to a Quaker family {{during the height of}} the American Civil War. Fetter proved an able student as a youth, as {{demonstrated}} by his acceptance to Indiana University in 1879 when he was only sixteen years old. At Indiana, he joined the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity. Fetter was on track to graduate with the class of 1883, but left college to run his family's bookstore upon news of his father's declining health. Working in the bookstore offered an opportunity for the young man to acquaint himself with some of the economic ideas that would later prove formative. <b>Chief</b> <b>among</b> the intellectual influences Fetter encountered at this time was Henry George's Progress and Poverty (1879).|$|E

5|$|In France, Champollion's success also {{produced}} enemies. Edmé-Francois Jomard was <b>chief</b> <b>among</b> them, and he spared no occasion to belittle Champollion's achievements behind his back, {{pointing out that}} Champollion {{had never been to}} Egypt and suggesting that really his lettre represented no major progress from Young's work. Jomard had been insulted by Champollion's demonstration of the young age of the Dendera zodiac, which he had himself proposed was as old as 15,000 years. This exact finding had also brought Champollion in the good graces of the Catholic Church which had been antagonized by the claims that Egyptian civilization might be older than the church-sanctioned chronology according to which the earth was only 6,000 years old.|$|E
5|$|In early 1947 the French {{administration}} {{instituted a}} new rule that increased {{the weight of}} the French vote over the Malagasy vote in selection of candidates, and three PADESM candidates favored by French conservatives were successfully elected to the Conseil de la Republique. The results of the election and popular discontent with French interference served to intensify widespread frustration against the colonial authority and desire for Malagasy self-governance across the island. These factors finally erupted in a nationalist uprising that began on the evening of 29 March 1947 with attacks against a police camp and several French plantations in the eastern rainforest carried out by militant Malagasy nationalists, <b>chief</b> <b>among</b> them the members of the nationalist secret societies Vy Vato Sakelika (VVS) and Jiny.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{presented}} {{as the primary}} antagonist who he must capture, Nero’s encounters with Dante {{over the course of}} the game reveal that the Order of the Sword is in fact responsible for a number of atrocities. <b>Chief</b> <b>among</b> them, is the Order's High-Ranking Scientist Agnus, who has succeeded in transforming himself, Credo, and a very-much-alive Sanctus into Demons with incredible power by siphoning demonic energy from Yamato, the long lost Devil Arm of Dante's twin brother Vergil. Furthermore, Sanctus has used Agnus' research to summon an army of demons to attack Fortuna, while simultaneously awakening a long dormant weapon called The Savior (a giant colossus made in Sparda's image) to destroy the threat; posing as the second coming of Sparda in order to eliminate non-believers, and strengthen his congregation’s worship.|$|E
