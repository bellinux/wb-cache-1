Logistic regression analyses revealed that environmental variables associated with visibility and safety, rather than food, correctly <b>classified</b> <b>sites</b> as persistent or non-persistent as well as persistent or intermittent. Discriminant function analysis that included the null sites revealed that the same visibility-related characteristics predicted where marmots were found. These results highlight the importance of variation in safety among sites in predicting long-term population persistence, as well as a species' distribution...|$|R

5000|$|Near {{the turn}} of the 21st century, Internet-based {{classified}} advertising, particularly the website Craigslist, was having {{a significant impact on the}} classified advertising business in newspapers nationwide. Classified advertising in daily newspapers as well as weekly alternatives, suburban papers and community papers was moving to the free advertising model of Craigslist and other smaller websites. In 2004, in response to this phenomenon, New Times Media (later to be known as Village Voice Media), a publisher of 11 alternative newsweeklies, launched a free classified website called backpage.com. The foundation and traditions of free classified advertising and free circulation were part of the fundamentals of the alternative newsweeklies dating back to 1971. The Chicago Reader and the Phoenix New Times were pioneers in these operating philosophies. Backpage soon became the second largest online <b>classified</b> <b>site</b> in the U.S. The site included the various categories found in newspaper classified sections including those that were unique to and part of the First-Amendment-driven traditions of most alternative weeklies.

40|$|The {{determination}} of response spectrum of a seismic excitation recorded on a chosen site {{is necessary in}} the structural dynamic design. The response spectrum can be obtained directly from recorded seismic data but this operation is expensive. The aim of this work is to avoid this problem where the acceleration response spectrum at the free face of a <b>classified</b> <b>site</b> is generated from that of reference by using the method of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The recorded spectrum value and corresponding period represent the inputs of the RNA, while the output is only the spectrum response value on the free field. The seismic data and the sites of the KIK-NET accelerograph network are used for the training and the validation of the neuronal model. The promising results obtained by this approach open a new research orientation {{on the use of}} the ANN in the field of soil dynamics and signal treatment, thus allowing the enrichment of the paraseismic codes into force...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept and}} {{structure}} of the Spatial Decision Support System AFFOREST sDSS dealing with environmental performance (EP) of afforestation on agricultural land in northwestern Europe, is presented. EP is defined in terms of three environmental impact categories: (1) carbon sequestration (2) groundwater recharge and (3) nitrate leaching. The core of the sDSS is a raster based geographical database which allows for queries addressing 14 types of questions on where, how and how long to afforest in order to reach a desired EP or change in EP due to afforestation of the agricultural land. First the study area is differentiated according to the site conditions (based on soil texture, soil drainage, initial land use, yearly average precipitation, and yearly average N deposition. Then the EP for every site class is computed as a function of time using the VSAM metamodel. VSAM results from a conceptual simplification of an existing mechanistic point model, the forest process model SMART 2. Input data for the metamodel are limited to the <b>classified</b> <b>site</b> conditions, the tree species used for afforestation, the afforestation strategy and the evaluation time. Besides limiting the data requirements, the metamodel approach allows for rapid and flexible computations on large numbers of pixel classes. Finally, {{depending on the type of}} question, the sDSS creates georeferenced outputs based on SQL-type spatial or attribute queries and more advanced multiple goal programming techniques...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{variability}} of levels {{and composition of}} PM 10 were investigated (October 2006 to May 2007) in a semi–rural <b>classified</b> <b>site</b> located in the central region {{of the state of}} Colima (Western Mexico), away from the direct influence of pollution sources. Mean PM 10 levels reached relatively high values (48 μg/m 3), due mainly to enhanced loads of crustal material (15 μg/m 3), carbonaceous aerosols (10 μg/m 3) and sulfate (9 μg/m 3). Dust resuspension, volcanic, industrial, agricultural, farming, and road traffic emissions, as well as regional pollution were identified as the main drivers of this variability. Furthermore, meteorological factors at local, regional and synoptic scales influenced such PM 10 variability. A differentiation was found between the cold period, with average PM 10 levels reaching 42 μg/m 3, and the warm period, with 56 μg/m 3. The first study period was characterized by high levels of SO 4 − 2 (19 μg/m 3) arising from both anthropogenic and volcanic emissions, whereas the second one is characterized by a high contribution from crustal material (22 μg/m 3) from soil resuspension and volcanic ash. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the highest contribution to PM 10 levels arises from the regional pollution (49 %), followed by the industrial emissions, fuel oil combustion, road traffic and secondary sulfate (18, 17, 10 and 6 %, respectively). This shows a large anthropogenic load in rural background PM pollution, consequently, we propose to build an air quality monitoring network in rural and urban areas of this region...|$|E
