5|$|At this time, Ueno Hikoma and Horie Kuwajirō also {{received}} photographic instruction from Rossier. Apparently Ueno had {{originally intended to}} learn not only the practice of photography but also the manufacture of cameras. The encounter with Rossier seems to have convinced Ueno to pursue photography as a career, {{but he was so}} overwhelmed by the technology of the camera that he quickly dropped the notion of making one himself. Within a few months, he and Horie had purchased a French <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> chemicals, thereafter launching their independent photographic careers.|$|E

50|$|Many single-lens reflex <b>cameras</b> <b>and</b> some {{rangefinder}} <b>cameras</b> have detachable lenses. A {{few other}} types do as well, notably the Mamiya TLR <b>cameras</b> <b>and</b> mirrorless interchangeable-lens <b>cameras.</b> The lenses {{attach to the}} camera using a lens mount, which contains mechanical linkages and often also electrical contacts between the lens <b>and</b> <b>camera</b> body.|$|R

5|$|Of the 640,000 {{individual}} pixels that compose each frame, Earth {{takes up}} less than one (0.12 pixels, according to NASA). The light bands across the photograph are an artifact, the result of sunlight scattering off parts of the <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> its sunshade, due to the relative proximity between the Sun and the Earth. Voyager's point of view was approximately 32° above the ecliptic. Detailed analysis suggested that the camera also detected the Moon, although it is too faint to be visible without special processing.|$|E
