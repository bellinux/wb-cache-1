40|$|The {{component}} technologies {{were developed}} required for an advanced control moment gyro (CMG) type of slewing actuator for large payloads. The {{key component of}} the CMG is a large-angle magnetic suspension (LAMS). The LAMS combines {{the functions of the}} gimbal structure, torque motors, and rotor bearings of a CMG. The LAMS uses a single superconducting source coil and an array of <b>cryoresistive</b> control coils to produce a specific output torque more than an order of magnitude greater than conventional devices. The designed and tested LAMS system is based around an available superconducting solenoid, an array of twelve room-temperature normal control coils, and a multi-input, multi-output control system. The control laws were demonstrated for stabilizing and controlling the LAMS system...|$|E
40|$|SatCon Technology Corporation {{is working}} toward the {{development}} of an advanced-concept Control Moment Gyro (CMG). The advanced-concept CMG is sized for use as a slewing actuator for large space-based payloads. The design features a magnetically suspended composite rotor which contains a persistent-mode superconducting solenoid magnet. The rotor is suspended and gimballed by the interaction of the fields produced by the superconductor and an array of <b>cryoresistive</b> coils. The rotor spins in a liquid helium environment, while the control coils are liquid-hydrogen cooled. This design is capable of meeting the requirements of many high-performance slewing applications (27, 000 Nm). The use of the magnetic suspension as rotor bearings, gimbal bearings, and gimbal torquers also substantially reduces the mass of the CMG system...|$|E
40|$|Two 500 -A class {{prototype}} high-temperature superconducting cables {{have been}} constructed by Southwire Company and tested at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). In the first cable, no insulation was used to separate the individual HTS tapes. In the second cable, Kapton tape was used to insulate the HTS tapes between successive layers {{for the study of}} AC loss and current distribution. The cables were tested with both DC and AC currents in liquid nitrogen from 77 to 69 K. Both cables achieved DC critical current, I{sub c} greater than 500 A. A calorimetric technique that measures the cable temperature rise under ac currents was used to measure the ac loss of the cables. The un-insulated cable showed a <b>cryoresistive</b> behavior under the 60 Hz AC currents. The insulated cable started to show measurable loss at current where there was corresponding resistive loss...|$|E
40|$|A {{new concept}} in {{magnetic}} levitation and control is introduced for levitation above a plane. A set of five vertical solenoid magnets mounted flush below the plane supports and controls {{the model in}} five degrees of freedom. The compact system of levitation coils is contained in a space 2. 4 m (96 in) diameter by 1 m (40 in) deep with {{the top of the}} levitation system 0. 9 m (36 in) below the center line of the suspended model. The levitated model has a permanent magnet core held in position by the five parallel superconductive solenoids symmetrically located in a circle. The control and positioning system continuously corrects for model position in five dimensions using computer current pulses superimposed on the levitation coil base currents. The conceptual designs include: superconductive and Nd-Fe-B permanent magnet model cores and levitation solenoids of either superconductive, <b>cryoresistive,</b> or room temperature windings...|$|E
40|$|The {{generation}} and transmission of electric power using equipment operating at cryogenic temperatures {{has been considered}} to be economically and technically feasible within ten to fifteen years. Cryogenic generators {{have the advantage of}} smaller size yielding greater generated power per unit volume. Superconducting or <b>cryoresistive</b> underground cables can transmit more power and with less losses than conventional oil/paper cables. However, the operating electric stresses of the electrical insulation have not been determined and studies of ageing phenomena are limited. A project has begun at the National Research Council of Canada to study the mechanisms of deterioration of polymeric tapes immersed in a cryogenic fluid and subjected to high electric stresses. The first part of the study is to determine the discharge inception and extinction stresses of various polymers immersed in pressurized liquid nitrogen and liquid helium. The initial results using liquid nitrogen are reported in this paper. Subsequent tests will determine the effects of partial discharges on the life of the insulation.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to find out whether {{technical}} or economic aspects justify the development of <b>cryoresistive</b> cables. Naturally cooled cables will not be able to transmit the amounts of power that will be in the future in the congestion areas. The installation of overhead lines or parallel conventional cables will not be possible because of the growing lack of space for the cable trenches. Consequently, the development of advanced-power-cables should already be started now. The solution of the problem, whether the use of a cable, especially of a cryocable, is technically and economically justified, depends on the construction of the cable, on the materials which are used, and on the cooling machinery. For economic reasons aluminium or perhaps copper will be the preferred material for the conductors. Thecooling liquid can be practically only liquid nitrogen. The study discusses six kinds of electrical insulations, three variations of the flow of the cooling medium, two possibilities for the arrangement of electrical and thermal insulation and some kinds of conductor constructions. Altogether there are 504 theoretical conceivable cable concepts. Taking certain selection criteria as basis, three principal concepts which promise the most success have been selected from these concepts. By furthervariation three definite cable concepts are obtained for one of the solutions, so that totally in this study five cable concepts are discussed in detail. The two cryocables which have been under development in the USA for some years now are included in these concepts. At a nominal voltage of 110 kV and 15 km distance between thecooling stations the limit is about 1000 to 1500 MVA, at 380 kV and the same distance about 4000 to 5000 MVA. At smaller distances the power limits are correspondingly higher. In addition for each cryocable concept the transmission costs per km cable length and per MVA power rating are determined in variation with the diameter of the cable, the distance between cooling stations and the transmitted power. The formula used for the costs takes into account the capital cost of the cable, termination and fitting costs, including installation, civil engineering, cooling stations and costs of power losses, i. e. the costs for the electrical losses in thecable and the energy costs for the cooling stations. All the costs are determined according to uniform criteria. The used cost-formula allows for the standard utility-load. The results show that at maximum load the capital costs of the cooling stations and the costs of power-losses yield the biggest contribution to the total costs. Whereas the cost of the cable itself can be determined relatively accurately, there are greater uncertainties with respect to the capital cost and the efficiency of the cooling stations because plants have not yet been built for such an application. The accuracy of the calculated transmission costs is therefore determined on the basis of these uncertainties. In order to make a comparison with conventional cables, the costs of conventional cables buried directly and in cooling-water-ducts were computed with the same formulas and the same assumptions as for cryocables. The limits of power tx'ansmission-capability and the transmission costs fo cryocables and conventional cables that have been found are in close agreement with the corresponding data which are cited in a recently published study of A. D. Little entitled"Underground Power Transmission". Within the accuracy which is nowadays possible in such a calculation it is found that all the five cable concepts can competewith the present cable systems. The following advantages may be important for the justification of the development of cryocables: the width of the cable trench related to the power rating is considerably less compared with conventional cables (see Fig. 8. 1) - by stepswise uprating of the installed cooling-stations the transmission capability can be adapted to the growing demand. - a multiplication of the transmission-capability is possible, if more cooling stations are installed in thecourse of the line. even operating at the maximum continous load, a cryocable can sustain a substantially higher short-time overload compared to a conventional cable because of its high heat capacity. Although we expect no unsurm√∂untable obstacles in the development of the cable concept which are considered to be promising, some important problems have to be solved, for example, the design of the electrical insulation, favourable construction of the conductor, shielding and piping for low eddy current losses and so on (see chapter 4. 2. 8). The data worked out in this study show that the cross-sections of cryocables will be large compared to conventional cables...|$|E
