40|$|M. Ing. The report {{presents}} and analyses allocation methods for assigning limited resources to project tasks. The report is partitioned into five chapters beginning with an introductory chapter. Chapter 1 summarises {{the problem and}} describes the process followed in addressing the problem. A literature chapter covers the literature for the development {{and analysis of the}} methods presented in the report. Chapter three presents the allocation methods and discusses the role of the methods in single and multi-project resource allocation. Two commercial methods (Hu’s Algorithm; and Coffman’s and Munt’s Algorithm) along with a recipe for implementation are discussed. It is followed by the introduction and formulation of two additional methods that base their resource allocation on critical and least <b>slack</b> <b>chains</b> (Least <b>Slack</b> and Least Slack Ancestors First methods). A final method, based on locating the best possible solution, is presented and formulated (Best Fit method). A case study is presented in chapter four which is applied to each of the formulated methods in chapter three. Key metrics are derived and necessary compassions among the methods are performed. Chapter 4 concludes with an analysis of the comparisons. Finally Chapter five presents a conclusion to the report summarising the results of chapters three and four. Future recommendations are also discussed with the main emphasis on a possible investigation of a hybrid method stemming from the application and analysis in chapter four...|$|R
50|$|The rear {{derailleur}} serves double duty: moving the chain between rear sprockets and taking up <b>chain</b> <b>slack</b> caused by {{moving to a}} smaller sprocket at the rear or a smaller chainring by the front derailleur. In order to accomplish this second task, it is positioned {{in the path of}} the bottom, slack portion of chain. Sometimes the rear-derailleurs are re-purposed as chain tensioners for single-speed bicycles that cannot adjust chain tension by a different method.|$|E
50|$|Some systems combine {{internally}} geared hubs {{with external}} derailleurs. A freewheeling hub with a sprocket suitable for narrow chain {{can be combined}} with a double or triple crankset and front derailleur, {{in order to provide}} a wider range and closer gear ratio spacing. A chain tensioner or a rear derailleur is needed to take up <b>chain</b> <b>slack,</b> and care is needed not to over-torque the hub by using too small a chainring/sprocket ratio.|$|E
50|$|Another method uses an {{eccentric}} mechanism {{either in the}} bottom bracket or in the rear hub. If neither of these are an option, when working with an existing frame not originally designed for single-speed use for example, some kind of idler pulley, such as the Surly Singleatoror simply a short cage rear derailleur {{can be used to}} take up <b>chain</b> <b>slack.</b> As well, finetuning the combination of chainring, cog, and chain length may suffice until the chain develops significant wear.|$|E

I left him in a hurry, to go to Gambril, who had called faintly that he {{believed}} there was some wind aloft. Indeed, my own ears had caught a feeble flutter of wet canvas, high up overhead, the jingle of a <b>slack</b> <b>chain</b> sheet. [...] .|$|R
60|$|The Roberta, lying nearest to {{the wind}} at <b>slack</b> <b>chains,</b> was swept off {{broadside}} like a straw. Then her chains brought her up, bow on {{to the wind}}, with an astonishing jerk. Schooner after schooner, the Malahini with them, was now sweeping away with the first gust and fetching up on taut chains. Mulhall {{and several of the}} Kanakas were taken off their feet when the Malahini jerked to her anchors.|$|R
50|$|The {{chain brake}} was {{operated}} by a 5/8 in link chain, which was carried on sheaves underneath the train along the centre, connected by coupling hooks between carriages or trucks. Under each vehicle, the <b>chain</b> hanged <b>slack</b> while not in use. It passed under two pulleys which were attached to pulling-rods to operate the wooden brake blocks. To operate the brakes, the chain could be tightened from {{either end of the}} train. The guard's van could be used to retard a train on down grades, or to stop the entire train. In the event of a broken or disconnected chain, however, the brake system was useless. By c. 1876, a simple vacuum brake system was introduced as a reserve brake.|$|R
50|$|The {{distance}} between {{the upper and lower}} pulleys of a rear derailleur is known as the cage length. Cage length, when combined with the pulley size, determines the capacity of a derailleur to take up <b>chain</b> <b>slack.</b> Cage length determines the total capacity of the derailleur, that is the size difference between the largest and smallest chainrings, and the size difference between the largest and smallest sprockets on the cogset added together. A larger sum requires a longer cage length. Typical cross country mountain bikes with three front chainrings will use a long cage rear derailleur. A road bike with only two front chainrings and close ratio sprockets can operate with either a short or long cage derailleur, but will work better with a short cage.|$|E
50|$|Although {{variations}} exist, {{as noted}} below, most rear derailleurs have several components in common. They have a cage that holds two pulleys that guide the chain in an S-shaped pattern. The pulleys {{are known as}} the jockey pulley or guide pulley (top) and the tension pulley (bottom). The cage rotates in its plane and is spring-loaded to take up <b>chain</b> <b>slack.</b> The cage is positioned under the desired sprocket by an arm that can swing back and forth under the sprockets. The arm is usually implemented with a parallelogram mechanism to keep the cage properly aligned with the chain as it swings back and forth. The {{other end of the}} arm mounts to a pivot point attached to the bicycle frame. The arm pivots about this point to maintain the cage at a nearly constant distance from the different sized sprockets. There may be one or more adjustment screws that control the amount of lateral travel allowed and the spring tension.|$|E
40|$|In a chain canveyor system, {{tensile force}} and <b>chain</b> <b>slack</b> have a {{significant}} effect on a material's vibration and transferring efficiency. Therefore it becomes an important problem for the chain conveyor to control tensile force and <b>chain</b> <b>slack,</b> Nowadays, most chain conveyor drive sprockets are driven by a motor, and the driven sprocket is controlled by a brake to give a moderate tensile force. However, it is difficult to adequately control the tensile force, because the brake has a tendency to influence the torque and revolution of the driving motor. We then developed a new driving system which has two motors; one is the main motor for conveying materials and the other is an auxiliary motor which is used to control tensile force and <b>chain</b> <b>slack</b> without influencing torque and revolution of the main motor. In this report, we describe the performance of this system...|$|E

Numerical results for the motions, mooring demands and also absorbed power by the converter, are presented for the different mooring configurations, for a system consisting of a hemispherical buoy in regular waves and assuming a liner power take-off system...|$|R
50|$|Fitted at {{the ends}} of the vehicle frames, one at each corner, the buffers are projecting, {{shock-absorbing}} pads which, when vehicles are coupled, are brought into contact with those on the next vehicle. The draw chain used between each pair of vehicles includes a screw which is tightened after coupling to shorten the chain and keep the buffers pressed together. Such is known as a 'screw coupling'. Historically, coupling chains were no more than that, a short length of heavy chain (typically three links long) with no adjustment. These would result in a 'loose-coupled train' in which the buffers of adjacent vehicles would only touch when the coupling <b>chain</b> was fully <b>slack,</b> such as when being pushed or going down hill.|$|R
40|$|We {{described}} in the previous report a new transfer mechanism which has two motors; one is the main motor for conveying materials {{and the other is}} an auxiliary motor for controlling tensile force and <b>chain</b> <b>slack.</b> But, when we use generally conveying system it can be foreseen that vibration often occures by the outer load and the performances decrease. So to decrease the vibration, we investigate the controlling method to hold constant the tensile force of chain and improve the efficiency. In this report, we use modern control theory for the hybrid type transfer mechanism and discuss the performance of controlling system...|$|E
5000|$|It is {{imperative}} (for road riding, at least) that the chain is sufficiently tight {{that it is}} impossible for it to derail from either the chainring or sprocket.

Tensioning aside, a chain is significantly less likely to derail if the chainline is accurate and the chain is a traditional [...] "full bushing" [...] type with limited lateral flexibility. Because the difference between a tight and a <b>slack</b> <b>chain</b> equates to only very minor elongation of the links, chain tension should be visually checked at least weekly, especially if the bicycle is ridden in wet or dirty conditions.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{experiments}} {{have shown a}} link between oxidation and strength changes in single crystal silicon nanostructures but provided no clues as to the mechanisms leading to this relationship. Through a mix of atomic force microscope based fracture strength experiments, molecular dynamics modeling, and comparisons to past experiments we have show that the previously described strength decrease {{is a result of}} oxidation induced roughening of an initially flat silicon (1 1 1) surface and that this effect is transient. In a fully developed native oxide the Si-SiO 2 interface flattens. As a result the strength recovers with some indication that it becomes slightly stronger than in its initially hydrogen terminated state. Experimental results are corroborated by Brad Boyce at Sandia National Laboratories using a completely separate line of testing involving micro-scale, polysilicon devices and the <b>slack</b> <b>chain</b> method. In addition, we demonstrate improvements to the calibration of the strength testing procedure, justify constitutive assumptions, and reduce overall uncertainty. Finally, we make an effort to extend the previous study of the effect of methyl monolayers on strength evolution of Si nanostructures by looking at more coating materials and longer time scales...|$|R
40|$|Most {{floating}} oscillating-body {{wave energy}} converters {{that have been}} proposed and developed so far are two-body systems where the power is extracted from the relative translational motion between the two bodies. As any floating device, floating point absorbers are subject to drift forces due to waves, currents and wind, and therefore need {{to be kept in}} place by a proper mooring system. The mooring cables can be approximately modelled as catenary lines in a quasi-static analysis. The use of a time-domain analysis allows for nonlinear mooring forces of <b>slack</b> <b>chain</b> cables to be considered. Numerical results for motion, mooring tensions and absorbed power are presented for a two body system consisting of a hemispherical floater and a submerged body and slack bottom moorings, for regular and irregular waves. Comparisons are given with the unmoored two-body heaving system, the moored heaving twobody system and with the simplified one body linear PTO model. Results show the possibility of occurrence of low-frequency horizontal oscillations of large amplitude, and non linear motions, even for regular waves. Some differences are seen in comparison with the simplified one body model and with the heave two-body system. The moorings were found not to affect very significantly the power absorbed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} calculate the forces in a chain and, thus, the resulting load distribution along the sprockets in a chain transmission working at a moderate or high speed. When the chain drive is loaded, the rollers that contact the sprockets will move along the flanks to different height positions. There are mainly two different ways to determine the actual positions: to assume the positions or to use force equilibrium and to calculate the positions. To find the correct solution the geometry and the force equilibrium are used which will give each roller's position, along the flank. This method demands knowledge of {{all parts of the}} <b>chain,</b> even the <b>slack</b> part. Therefore it has been necessary to model both the connecting tight and the slack spans in which power between the two sprockets is transmitted. The gravitational force acting at the chain has been included in the complete model so that the position of the rollers and the forces in the links at the slack span can be calculated. The elastic deformation in the chain has also been included. The moment of inertia in the two sprockets and in the outer geometry has been taken into account, but not the inertia forces in the chain...|$|R
6000|$|What here {{concerns}} us is, Friedrich's {{feelings on}} hearing of it; which no reader can now imagine. Horror, amazement, pity, very poignant; grief for one's hapless friend Peter, for one's still more hapless self! [...] "The Sisyphus stone, {{which we had}} got dragged to the top, the <b>chains</b> all beautifully <b>slack</b> these three months past,--has it leapt away again? And {{on the eve of}} Burkersdorf, and our grand Daun problem!" [...] Truly, the Destinies have been quite dramatic with this King, and have contrived the moment of hitting him to the heart. He passionately entreats Czernichef to be helpful to him,--which Czernichef would fain be, only how can he? To be helpful; at least to keep the matter absolutely secret yet for some hours: this the obliging Czernichef will do. And Friedrich remains, Czernichef having promised this, in the throes of desperate consideration and uncertainty, hour after hour,--how many hours I do not know. It is confidently said, [Retzow, ii. 415.] Friedrich had the thought of forcibly disarming Czernichef and his 20,000:--in which case he must have given up the Daun Enterprise; for without Czernichef as a positive quantity, much more with Czernichef as a negative, it is impossible. But, at any rate, most luckily for himself, he came upon a milder thought: [...] "Stay with us yet three days, merely in the semblance of Allies, no service required of you, but keeping the matter a dead secret;--on the fourth day go, with my eternal thanks!" [...] This is his milder proposal; urged with his best efforts upon the obliging Czernichef: who is in huge difficulty, and sees it to be at peril of his head, but generously consents. It is the same Czernichef who got lodged in Custrin cellars, on one occasion: know, O King,--the King, before this, does begin to know,--that Russians too can have something of heroic, and can recognize a hero when they see him! In this fine way does Friedrich get the frightful chasm, or sudden gap of the ground under him, bridged over for the moment; and proceeds upon Burkersdorf all the same.|$|R
40|$|Technological {{breakthroughs}} in the maritime transport industry {{gave rise to}} multimodality and global supply <b>chains</b> (Olivier & <b>Slack,</b> 2006). The high competitive character of this maritime transport industry induced transnational corporations (TNCs) to integrate their logistic processes horizontally and vertically. In order to keep attracting these TNCs, ports evolved downstream away from the city, followed by an economic, spatial and most recently by an institutional separation; resulting in less innovation due to the decreasing related variety between maritime and urban economics (Hall & Jacobs, 2012). Other emerging varying conditions {{are related to the}} sea level rise which reduces available space were port could further expand, leading to governance dilemmas between economy and ecology. Finally, as the burdens, such as congestion or a decreasing employment rate, are for the region, and the economic benefits are for a small group of TCNs, the ‘license to operate’ has become increasingly complex. The numerous different concepts and models trying to understand these changes are usually based on a historic-morphological approach that {{can be traced back to}} the so-called ‘anyport model’ and its modifications (Hoyle, 1989). The theoretical approach of these models is imbedded in structuralism and tries to generalize the observed evolution of the port city complex. An increasing number of researchers critiques the mainstream theories and their ambition for building universal understanding. Researchers emphasize the importance of the port city interface and its related variety. Therefore they point out the risk of facilitating the multidimensional separation by using a wrong assumption and a lack of understanding local processes with a global outlook. To tackle this risk, we have to move beyond this lock-in (Boelens & de Roo, 2014). There is a need to move towards a post-structural perspective of the port city interface, resulting in a more complex, actor-relational and co-evolving approach. This paper is the first step of a four year PhD-research on the theme of the port city interface. In the first part a literature framework is proposed of the previous research about the subject, questioning if existing studies have to be more attuned to regional and local characteristics. The second section focuses on the post-structuralist approach and explores its potential application for the study of the port city complexes. It will illustrate recent ideas of co-evolution and actor networks (Boelens & de Roo, 2014) applied on case studies in Belgium...|$|R
