50|$|Riparian {{woodland}} vegetation {{is located}} Carbonera Creek and its tributaries. The 1990 Earth Metrics EIR identifies broadleaf deciduous trees as dominating this habitat {{and are able}} to survive because of the year-round presence of fresh water. Examples of such trees present in the riparian zone include California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica), boxelder (Acer negundo), California Sycamore (Platanus racemosa), black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), Bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), white alder (Alnus rhombifolia), and various willows (Salix spp.). Invasive root systems of these trees are important in erosion control and their dense canopy provides food and shelter for a variety of birds and mammals, yielding high habitat value. The lush cover afforded by this habitat also provides wildlife with a suitable environment for breeding. Additional vegetation found along creek banks includes California blackberry (Rubus vitifolius), Himalaya blackberry (Rubus procerus), poison oak (Rhus diversiloba), baltic rush (Juncus balticus), redwood sorrel (Oxalis oregana), snowberry (Symphoricarpos rivularis), <b>Coastal</b> <b>wood</b> <b>fern</b> (Dryopteris arguta), and other herbaceous species and decaying vegetation.|$|E

50|$|It is a {{tetraploid}} {{of hybrid}} origin, one parent being Dryopteris intermedia, known in North America as the intermediate <b>wood</b> <b>fern,</b> and an unknown, apparently extinct species dubbed Dryopteris semicristata, {{which is also}} the presumed parent of the hybrid-origin Dryopteris cristata.This fern is often confused with several other <b>wood</b> <b>fern</b> species, including D. intermedia, D. campyloptera, and D. expansa. It especially extensively shares the range of D. intermedia, but the two may be distinguished by the innermost pinnule on the bottom side of the bottom pinna: this pinnule is longer than the adjacent pinnules in D. carthusiana, but shorter or even in D. intermedia. D. carthusiana is a sub-evergreen species, its fronds surviving mild winters but dying back in harsh winters.|$|R

2500|$|The main {{difference}} between the spruce-fir forests of Southern Appalachia and the spruce-fir forests in northern latitudes is the dense broad-leaved understory of the former. [...] The spruce-fir understories of the Smokies are home to catawba rhododendron, mountain ash, pin cherry, thornless blackberry, and hobblebush. [...] The herbaceous and litter layers of the spruce-fir forests are poorly lit year-round, and are thus dominated by shade-tolerant plants such as <b>ferns,</b> namely mountain <b>wood</b> <b>fern</b> and northern lady fern, and over 280 species of mosses.|$|R
5000|$|The Dryopteridaceae are {{a family}} of leptosporangiate ferns in the order Polypodiales. They are known colloquially as the <b>wood</b> <b>ferns.</b> They {{comprise}} about 1700 species and have a cosmopolitan distribution. They may be terrestrial, epipetric, hemiepiphytic, or epiphytic. Many are cultivated as ornamental plants. [...] The largest genera are Elaphoglossum (600), Polystichum (260), Dryopteris (225), and Ctenitis (150). These four genera contain about 70% of the species. [...] Dryopteridaceae diverged from the other families in eupolypods I about 100 million years ago.|$|R
50|$|Hammock gaps, similar to, but {{substantially}} different from hammock edges {{are also important}} to hammock dynamics. Historically, hammock gaps were typically created by storm events, including hurricanes, which allowed pioneer species to invade openings in the hammock canopy. Pioneer species associated with hammock disturbance include trees, shrubs, and herbs such as common nightshade (Solanum americanum), firebush, potatowood (Solanum erianthum), rougeplant (Rivina humilis), and <b>wood</b> <b>fern</b> (Dryopteris ludoviciana), as well as vines such as muscadine grape, and greenbrier. Vines with limited distributions associated with gaps include Passiflora multiflora, Passiflora sexflora, and Rhynchosia swartzii.|$|R
50|$|The beech-maple forest harbors a few {{tree species}} that are more common in cooler climates: yellow birch, Canadian Hemlock and Canada yew are common there. Some of these trees cling to the rock faces, their roots pushing into every {{available}} crevice. In {{the shelter of the}} roots and shaded by the leafy canopy above, ferns such as the Christmas fern and maidenhair fern grow in abundance. Others such as the marginal shield <b>fern,</b> grape <b>fern,</b> <b>wood</b> <b>fern,</b> and common polypody are more unusual for this part of the state.|$|R
50|$|The {{lava tube}} {{collapse}} systems and lava outcrops support a great diversity of plant life, from an impressive variety of lichens and mosses to {{plants such as}} desert sweet (Chamaebatiaria millefolium), the aromatic purple desert sage (Salvia dorrii carnosa) and yellow blazing star (Mentzelia laevicaulis).An impressive variety of fern species are present in cave entrances including the spreading <b>wood</b> <b>fern</b> (Dryopteris expansa) and the western swordfern (Polystichum munitum). These species are well outside of their normal range which is 90 - 125 mi west on the northern California coastline.|$|R
50|$|Dryopteris expansa, {{the alpine}} buckler fern, {{northern}} buckler-fern or spreading <b>wood</b> <b>fern,</b> is {{a species of}} fern native to cool temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, south at high altitudes in mountains to Spain and Greece in southern Europe, to Japan in eastern Asia, and to central California in North America. The species was first described from Germany. It prefers cool, moist mixed or evergreen forests and rock crevices on alpine slopes, often growing on rotting logs and tree stumps and rocky slopes. It is characteristically riparian in nature, and is especially associated with stream banks.|$|R
50|$|Christmas fern {{resembles the}} Pacific Coast sword fern, Polystichum munitum, {{but does not}} make the huge clumps which that fern forms, and it differs from it and almost all other ferns in that fertile (spore bearing) {{leaflets}} of the Christmas fern are noticeably smaller than the sterile leaflets and located on the same leaf. The fertile leaflets are identified by being covered by a typically brown covered mass and are located {{at the tip of the}} leaf. Like other ferns of the genus Polystichum, it is allied to the <b>wood</b> <b>ferns,</b> genus Dryopteris, to which it is often found growing in close proximity.|$|R
