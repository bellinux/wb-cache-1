40|$|We {{present an}} {{architecture}} for a peer-to-peer (P 2 P) file system which supports semantics-based access.

Our semantic indexing and locating approach is based on distributed hash tables (DHTs) where the in-dices of semantically <b>close</b> <b>files</b> are clustered to the same peers with high probability (nearly 100 %) {{by the use of}} lo-cality sensitive hash functions. A query for finding semanti-cally <b>close</b> <b>files</b> can be answered by consulting {{only a small number of}} peer nodes which are most responsible for such a query, instead of by query flooding. Our approach only adds index information to peer nodes, thus imposing only a small storage overhead. This paper constitutes an initial step to integrate semantics-based access mechanisms into a P 2 P file system. 1...|$|R
50|$|A natural {{approach}} is to make holding a resource be a class invariant: resources are acquired during object creation (specifically initialization), and released during object destruction (specifically finalization). This is known as Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII), and ties resource management to object lifetime, ensuring that live objects have all necessary resources. Other approaches do not make holding the resource a class invariant, and thus objects may not have necessary resources (because they've not been acquired yet, have already been released, or are being managed externally), resulting in errors such as trying to read from a <b>closed</b> <b>file.</b> This approach ties resource management to memory management (specifically object management), so {{if there are no}} memory leaks (no object leaks), there are no resource leaks. RAII works naturally for heap-managed resources, not only stack-managed resources, and is composable: resources held by objects in arbitrarily complicated relationships (a complicated object graph) are released transparently simply by object destruction (so long as this is done properly!).|$|E
5000|$|How long {{should a}} {{government}} office retain a <b>closed</b> <b>file?.</b> There are {{different kinds of}} disposals in government system. Certain files need not be retained at all whereas certain others need to retained. Depending {{on the importance of}} the matter, Government has evolved a system retaining them with proper classification. “N. Dis” indicates nil disposal which means that it need not be retained and the original can be returned. If it is marked as “ K. Dis” it means, it has to be kept for three years and later it can be destroyed. “L. Dis.” means it can be destroyed after 1 year [...] Once the letter is approved by competent authority it'll be fair copied in the fair copying section and immediately dispatched. There is a register in which all these entries are made then and there. The arrangements for storing these records also to be made in every Office. There will be a record clerk {{who is in charge of}} storing files and retrieving them.|$|E
5000|$|A {{fundamental}} {{problem is that}} having a resource {{is no longer a}} class invariant (the resource is held from object creation until it is disposed, but the object is still live at this point), so the resource may not be available when the object tries to use it, for example trying to read from a <b>closed</b> <b>file.</b> This means that all methods on the object that use the resource potentially fail, concretely usually by returning an error or raising an exception. In practice this is minor, as use of resources can usually fail for other reasons as well (for example, trying to read past the end of a file), so these methods already might fail, and not having a resource just adds another possible failure. A standard way to implement this is to add a boolean field to the object, called , which is set to true by , and checked by a guard clause to all methods (that use the resource), raising an exception (such as [...] in [...]NET) if the object has been disposed.|$|E
50|$|A {{very common}} example is failing to <b>close</b> <b>files</b> {{that have been}} opened, which leaks a file handle; this also occurs with pipes. Another common example is a parent process failing to call wait on a child process, which leaves the {{completed}} child process as a zombie process, leaking a process table entry.|$|R

40|$|Concurrency bugs are {{becoming}} increasingly prevalent in the multi-core era. Recently, much {{research has focused on}} data races and atomicity violation bugs, which are related to low-level memory accesses. However, a large number of concurrency typestate bugs such as “invalid reads to a <b>closed</b> <b>file</b> from a different thread” are under-studied. These concurrency typestate bugs are important yet challenging to study since they are mostly relevant to high-level program semantics. This paper presents 2 ndStrike, a method to manifest hidden concurrency typestate bugs in software testing. Given a state machine describing correct program behavior on certain object typestates, 2 ndStrike profiles runtime events related to the typestates and thread synchronization. Based on the profiling results, 2 ndStrike then identifies bug candidates, each of which is a pair of runtim...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Digital {{synthesis}} {{with a goal}} of chip designing in {{the commercial}} electronics arena is packed into large EDA Software providers like, Synopsys, Cadence, or MentorGraphics. These commercial tools being expensive and having <b>closed</b> <b>file</b> structures. It is also a financial constraint for the startup companies sometimes who have their budget limitations. Any bug-fixes or add features cannot be made with ease; in such scenario the company is forced to opt for an alternative cost effective EDA software. This paper deals with the advantages of using open source EDA tools like Icarus Verilog, Verilator, GTKwave viewer, GHDL VHDL simulator, gEDA, etc. that are available as a free source and focuses on the Icarus Verilog simulator tool.

40|$|Debuggers for logic {{programming}} languages have traditionally had a capability most other debuggers did not: {{the ability to}} jump back to a previous state of the program, effectively travelling back in {{time in the history}} of the computation. This "retry" capability is very useful, allowing programmers to examine in detail a part of the computation that they previously stepped over. Unfortunately, it also creates a problem: while the debugger may be able to restore the previous values of variables, it cannot restore the part of the program's state that is affected by I/O operations. If the part of the computation being jumped back over performs I/O, then the program will perform these I/O operations twice, which will result in unwanted effects ranging from the benign (e. g. output appearing twice) to the fatal (e. g. trying to close an already <b>closed</b> <b>file).</b> We presen...|$|E

40|$|Program queries {{can answer}} {{important}} software engineering questions {{that range from}} “which expressions are cast to this type?” over “does my program attempt to read from a <b>closed</b> <b>file?</b> ” to “does my code follow the prescribed design?”. In this paper, we present a comprehensive tool suite for querying Java programs. It consists of the logic program query language SOUL, the CAVA library of predicates for quantifying over an Eclipse workspace and the Eclipse plugin BARISTA for launching queries and inspecting their results. BARISTA allows other Eclipse plugins to peruse program query results which is facilitated by the symbiosis of SOUL with Java – setting SOUL apart from other program query languages. This symbiosis enables the CAVA library to forego the predominant transcription to logic facts of the queried program. Instead, the library queries the actual AST nodes used by Eclipse itself, making it trivial for any Eclipse plugin to find the AST nodes that correspond to a query result. Moreover, such plugins {{do not have to}} worry about having queried stale program information. We illustrate the extensibility of our suite by implementing a tool for co-evolving source code and annotations using program queries...|$|E
40|$|Tese de mestrado, Museologia e Museografia, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Belas Artes, 2012 This study {{involves}} {{the reading of}} the urban landscape as a curatorial exercise into the existence and the construction of human utopias and is a case study applied to set urban benchmarks, in an analysis of its contexts of habitability. The city of Setubal as a macro urban structure provides an interesting subject for study in relation to its history of settlement and pre settlement, and the archaeological record of its formations and transformations as an area of settlement. The materialization of these experiences are presented as passive objects of reading through the "designs" of "urbanism and its buildings, utopias are materialized in physical objects, using concepts and styles observed, the elements that establish encrypted, or coded language. The case study applies to a micro structure of the urban estructure, Avenida Luisa Todi,a perspective that emphasizes reading the pre-existence and existence of settlements, an analysis of the contemporary "organism" of the city, and the presentation of a museum –based intervention project, which safeguards its heritage and primates its classification as a whole entity. The analysis of urban features and buildings of the structure aims to emphasize the value of local studies, specifically of the city of Setubal, to enhance the value of its structure as an area of excellence because of its historical legacy in both a regional and national context. Finally, it aims to motivate people to participate in defense of their heritage as part of a collective identity. The practices and methodologies applied to this entity, as an object of study, could be a model for other educational projects in which issues of interpretation of urban landscapes, natural landscapes and built landscapes, should be the focus of reflection in the collection of memories, implementation of projects, dissemination of heritage education and safeguarding of heritage identities. A curatorial approach will be adopted in this Master’s thesis that seeks to comprehensively interpret the material plans of "museology" through the urban space of Avenida Luisa Todi, but which also uses a comparative approach to articulated "stories" which are subject to various readings. This reading, however, does not constitute a <b>closed</b> <b>file</b> on the object in questio...|$|E
