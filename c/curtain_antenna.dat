50|$|The Wavre radio {{transmitter}} is a facility for mediumwave, shortwave, FM and TV broadcasting near Wavre in Belgium. For the mediumwave transmissions {{it uses a}} grounded 250-metre-high guyed mast. Furthermore, there is a backup mast for medium wave transmissions, which is 90 metres high. For shortwave broadcasting several directional antennas and a <b>curtain</b> <b>antenna</b> are used. The towers {{are two of the}} tallest structures in Belgium.|$|E
5000|$|For example, a [...] "HRS 4/5/0.5" [...] <b>curtain</b> <b>antenna</b> has a {{rectangular}} array of 20 dipoles, 4 dipoles high and 5 dipoles wide, {{with the lowest}} row being half a wavelength off the ground, and a flat reflector behind it, and {{the direction of the}} beam can be steered. An HRS 4/4/0.5 steerable antenna with 16 dipoles is one of the standard types of array seen at shortwave broadcast stations worldwide.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: Simulated {{radiation}} pattern of a 15.1 MHz HR 6/4/1 <b>curtain</b> <b>antenna</b> (24 horizontal dipoles organized in 6 rows of 4 elements each, {{in front of}} a reflector), driven by a 500 kW transmitter. The transmitter is located in Seattle and the pattern covers Central America and parts of South America, showing the long distances achieved with this antenna. The main lobe of the pattern is flanked by two sidelobes, which appear curved due to the global map projection.|$|E
5000|$|If {{there is}} an [...] "S" [...] in the antenna's designation, it is a {{steerable}} design. This might be achieved electronically by adjustment of the electrical wave phases of the signals fed to the columns of dipole antenna elements, or physically by mounting the antenna array on a large rotating mechanism. An example {{of this can be}} seen at NRK Kvitsøy, where a circular railway carries a pair of wheeled platforms, each of which supports a tower at opposite ends of a diameter-arm. The <b>curtain</b> <b>antenna</b> array is suspended between the towers and rotates with them as the towers go around the circular railway. Another physical rotation technique is employed by the ALLISS system where the entire array is built around a central rotatable tower of great strength. Electrically steered antenna arrays can usually be aimed in the range of ±30° from the antenna's physical direction while mechanically rotated arrays can accomadate a full 360°. Electrical steering is typically done in the horizontal plane, with some adjustment being possible in the vertical plane.|$|E
40|$|For the {{radiating}} {{capacity of}} <b>curtain</b> <b>antenna</b> array, this paper constructs a three- line-four-column <b>curtain</b> <b>antenna</b> array using cage antenna as the antenna array element and obtains a normalizing 3 D radiation patterns through conducting simulation with MATLAB. Meanwhile, {{the relationships between}} the antenna spacing and the largest directivity coefficient, as well as the communication frequency and largest directivity coefficient are analyzed in this paper. It turns out that the max value will generate when the antenna spacing is around 18 m and the best communication effect will be achieved when the communication frequency is about 12. 4 MHz. ...|$|E
50|$|All of the Voice Of Mongolia's {{broadcasts}} come {{directly from}} its Khonkhor Transmitting Station, about 25 km east of Ulan Bator, Mongolia's capital. It broadcasts through Soviet-made 100, 250, and 500 kW transmitters and <b>curtain</b> <b>antennas</b> {{built in the}} mid sixties. The transmissions beamed to East Asia provide fair reception in South America, and the South Asian transmissions {{can be heard in}} Southern Africa and in Europe as well. However, this reception is influenced by propagation conditions and frequency congestion.|$|R
5000|$|Rotatable <b>curtain</b> array <b>antennas</b> {{were not}} in common use until the 1960s, so PCJ was far {{ahead of its time}} with its {{introduction}} of rotatable HRS type antennas.|$|R
50|$|Sterba {{curtains}} are modest-gain single-band <b>curtain</b> array <b>antennas.</b> They {{are named}} after Ernest J. Sterba, who developed a simple shortwave curtain array for Bell Labs in the 1930s. Sterba curtain arrays {{are described in}} William Orr's Radio Handbook.|$|R
5000|$|The HRS type antenna is {{an example}} of a <b>curtain</b> array <b>antenna.</b> It has Horizontal dipoles with a Reflector behind them, and the beam is Steerable. These antennas are also known as [...] "HRRS" [...] (for a Reversible Reflector), but the extra R is seldom used.|$|R
5000|$|Curtain arrays are a {{class of}} large multielement {{directional}} wire radio transmitting antennas, used in the shortwave radio bands. [...] They are a type of reflective array antenna, consisting of multiple wire dipole antennas, suspended in a vertical plane, often {{in front of a}} [...] "curtain" [...] reflector made of a flat vertical screen of many long parallel wires. These are suspended by support wires strung between pairs of tall steel towers, up to 300 ft high. They are used for long-distance skywave (or skip) transmission; they transmit a beam of radio waves at a shallow angle into the sky just above the horizon, which is reflected by the ionosphere back to Earth beyond the horizon. <b>Curtain</b> <b>antennas</b> are mostly used by international short wave radio stations to broadcast to large areas at transcontinental distances.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Lincolnshire Poacher" [...] was a {{powerful}} shortwave numbers station that transmitted from Cyprus from the mid-1970s to June 2008. The station gained its commonly known name as it uses bars from the English folk song [...] "The Lincolnshire Poacher" [...] as an interval signal. The radio station {{was believed to be}} operated by the British Secret Intelligence Service and emanated from the island of Cyprus. Amateur direction finding linked it with the Royal Air Force base at Akrotiri, Cyprus, where several <b>curtain</b> <b>antennas</b> had been identified as being its transmitter. It consisted of an electronically synthesised English-accented female voice reading groups of five numbers: e.g. '0-2-5-8-8'. The final number in each group was spoken at a higher pitch. It is likely that the station was used to communicate to undercover agents (spies) operating in other countries, to be decoded using a one-time pad.|$|R

The site is capable of DRM digital shortwave transmissions. An image of the rotatable <b>curtain</b> array <b>antenna</b> in Montsinéry can be found by searching Flickr for [...] "Montsinery antenne". One of their broadcasting frequencies is the 7335 kHz slot that CHU (Canada) recently abandoned.|$|R
5000|$|So, a [...] "HRS 4/5/0.5" [...] <b>antenna</b> <b>curtain</b> is 4 dipoles wide, and 5 dipoles {{high with}} the lowest row being 0.5 {{wavelengths}} {{off the ground and}} with a standard reflector. An HRS 4/4/0.5 is one of the standard types of array seen at shortwave broadcast stations worldwide.|$|R
50|$|Sitkūnai Radio Station {{is a large}} {{facility}} for medium wave and shortwave broadcastingat Sitkūnai, Lithuania. The decision {{to build a new}} transmitting centre near the village of Sitkunai, about 17 km north of Kaunas was made by the Government of Lithuania in 1937. The building works started in 1939, and after completion, a 120 kW medium wave transmitter from Standard Telephones and Cables in the United Kingdom was ordered. However, the outbreak of World War II stopped the shipment. The empty transmitter buildings in Sitkunai survived the war with almost no damage and were used as military compound by the German army in 1941-1944, and later as a primary school. Because the Soviet Lithuania was badly covered by radio signals, the Soviet authorities decided to continue the building work at Sitkunai and turn the site into a main shortwave and medium wave transmitting centre. During 1951 and 1952 two 50 kW shortwave transmitters, dismantled from an East German utility site as war reparations were installed in Sitkūnai. Several <b>curtain</b> <b>antennas</b> were erected and one 150 kW mediumwave transmitter was installed (665 kHz). During the January Events in 1991, Sitkūnai Radio Station was among those transmitting sites broadcasting to the world about the Soviet military actions in Vilnius when 14 civilians were killed and more than 600 injured.|$|R
50|$|The {{resulting}} <b>curtain</b> array <b>antenna</b> {{produced a}} horizontally polarised signal that was directed strongly forward along the {{perpendicular to the}} line of the towers. This direction was known as the line of shoot, and was generally aimed out over the water. The broadcast pattern covered an area of about 100 degrees in a roughly fan-shaped area, with a smaller side lobe to the rear, courtesy of the reflectors, and much smaller ones to the sides. When the signal reflected off the ground it underwent a ½ wavelength phase-change, which caused it to interfere with the direct signal. The result was a series of vertically-stacked lobes about 5 degrees wide from 1 degree off the ground to the vertical. The system was later expanded by adding another set of four additional antennas closer to the ground, wired in a similar fashion.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{commonly}} used shortwave antennas for international broadcasting are the HRS <b>antenna</b> (<b>curtain</b> array), which cover a 2 to 1 frequency range and the log-periodic antenna which cover up to 8 to 1 frequency range. Within that range, the SWR will vary, but is usually kept below 1.7 to 1 [...] - [...] {{within the range of}} SWR that can be tuned by antenna matching built-into many modern transmitters. Hence, when feeding these antennas, a modern transmitter will be able to tune itself as needed to match at any frequency.|$|R
