This paper {{describes how the}} use of the ecosystem services (ES) concept can help to identify the main stakeholders associated with wetland conservation, using the Hula Wetland in the Sea of Galilee’s watershed as a case study. We conducted a stakeholder analysis based on semi-structured interviews. We focused on the management of two semi-natural areas within the larger Hula Wetland area (Hula Nature Reserve and Agamon), in which different management regimes are used and which provide different bundles of ES to different stakeholders. Using the ES concept in the stakeholder analysis, we were able to present the Hula Wetland management in a comprehensive manner. The approach also revealed a lack of coordination between the managing organisations which might lead to competition favouring cultural services (in particular tourism) at the expense of habitat services (i. e. biodiversity conservation) in the future. To test our method we also conducted a stakeholder analysis in the Camargue Wetland in France. The two wetlands have similar characteristics but are embedded in different institutional contexts. The Camargue Regional Park has a multi-stakeholder platform which could serve as an example for the Hula Wetland to improve its management and lead to better <b>coordination</b> <b>and</b> <b>complementarity</b> of ES provided by the two sub-sites.

40|$|This Strategy {{has been}} {{developed}} {{in response to the}} growing concern of the negative impacts of climate change and climate variability on the country’s social, economic and physical environment. Its overall aim is to enhance the technical, institutional and individual capacity of the country to address the impacts of climate change. The Strategy covers adaptation, mitigation and cross-cutting interventions that will enable Tanzania the benefit from the opportunities available to developing countries in their efforts to tackle climate change. These opportunities were recognized under the Copenhagen Accord, Cancun Agreement and Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, and they include technology transfer to developing countries under the proposed Technology Mechanism; opportunities offered by the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Plus (REDD+) Mechanism; and financing for both adaptation and mitigation activities under the proposed ‘Fast Start Climate Fund (of up to USD($) 30 billion in 2012), rising gradually to USD($) 100 billion annually by 2020 and last but not least, the Green Climate Fund, whose aim is to promote the paradigm shift towards low emission and climate resilient development pathways by providing support to developing countries to limit their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Climate may change more rapidly than expected and is expected to have complex, long term consequences for the environment, and for our production systems. The adverse impacts of climate change are now far reaching and evident {{in most parts of the}} world. It is a serious risk to poverty reduction and threatens to undo decades of development efforts. The impacts are more pronounced in poor countries such as Tanzania with the least adaptive capacity. The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, 2007, confirmed an increase of mean temperature of approximately 0. 74 oC and the sea level rise of about 17 cm over the past 100 years. Further projections also provide that sea levels will continue to rise for at least another century due to thermal expansion, even if GHG concentrations could be reduced (Meehl et al., 2007). If GHG concentrations remain at the constant levels of the year 2000, global temperature is likely to rise from 0. 3 °C to 0. 9 °C per decade. Mitigation to climate change is therefore of paramount importance to limit adverse temperature increases. It is imperative that the public sector and all major stakeholders have a central role to plan, implement, enforce, monitor and evaluate the implication of climate change through strategic interventions, plans and programmes (Ehler, C. N., et al., 1997), to be implemented at national level. The development of this strategy responds to the above needs by ensuring that there is more <b>coordination</b> <b>and</b> <b>complementarity</b> between key economic sectors in implementing climate change activities. Moreover this Strategy makes it easier for the country to benefit from global climate change mitigation and adaptation opportunities while contributing significantly to the international community efforts to address climate change. International cooperation as a key tool in addressing climate change challenges at national and regional level. The approach and methodology employed in the development of this Strategy involved extensive literature review and analysis, which was undertaken to identify the linkages between climate change, natural resource management and socio-economic systems. This was augmented by national consultations with various stakeholders ranging from zonal workshops which were undertaken to collect and collate views from individuals at community level, create awareness on climate change impacts and the need for a Strategy to harmonize on-going and future activities. The five zonal workshops were conducted in: Mtwara representing the Southern zone (31 January - 2 February 2011); Arusha representing the Northern zone (6 - 9 March 2011); Mwanza representing the Lake Zone 26 - 29 May 2011); and Mpanda representing the Western zone (20 - 21 June 2011). Additionally, the national stakeholder workshop held in January 2012 with representation from the private sector, public sector, development partners as well as the academia was undertaken to support the validation of the final draft this Strategy. A multidisciplinary team of experts was selected and worked closely with the National Climate Change Focal point, the Division of Environment, Vice President’s Office (VPO) to prepare initial drafts of this Strategy. The team was drawn from various governmental ministerial departments and agencies (MDAs), research institutions, academia and civil society. The team also received, reviewed and integrated stakeholders’ views in the Strategy. The team of experts held a number of working sessions towards accomplishment of this document. The goal of the Strategy is to enable Tanzania to effectively adapt to climate change and participate in global efforts to mitigate climate change with a view to achieving sustainable development in line with the Five Years National Development plan; the Tanzania Development Vision 2025, as well as national sectorial policies. It is expected that this Strategy will reduce vulnerability and enhance resilience to the impacts of climate change. The implementation of the Strategy will enable the country to put in place measures to adapt to climate change and mitigate GHG emissions in order to achieve sustainable national development through climate resilient pathways.

40|$|Includes bibliographyPresentation The {{countries}} of the Latin American and Caribbean region have shown a keen and lasting interest in mechanisms of economic development and public policies for its promotion. This is {{a process in which}} ECLAC has been involved ever since it was founded over half a century ago. Today, the debate on these issues continues against the backdrop of a globalization process in which the remarkable dynamism of some dimensions -especially its economic, financial and cultural aspects- contrasts with the slow formation of an institutional network capable of coping with the increased interdependence of nations on various levels and of gradually rectifying the striking asymmetries of the global order. Over the past two decades, the Latin American and Caribbean region has wagered heavily on its integration into the global economy. In fact, of all the developing regions of the world, it has been the most resolute in its pursuit of economic liberalization. A review of this period brings to light a number of extremely important achievements, but it also reveals areas in which the region is lagging behind and others in which unfinished business remains. ECLAC contends that the region must build upon the progress it has already made, but it also has to close existing gaps and address unresolved issues. The inroads made in these areas may {{play a vital role in}} consolidating the region's fuller integration into the world economy and in ensuring that the social, economic and political costs of the economic reform process have not been incurred in vain. In order to accomplish this, the "more market and less State" approach that guided the economic reform process must give way to an emphasis on properly functioning markets and quality in governance. This new approach, which entails the use of active public policies capable of overcoming both market and government failures, can prove to be more market-friendly than the line of reasoning that was the driving force behind the initial reforms. These active public policies must be backed by the political legitimacy afforded by democratic institutions and must be founded upon public transparency as well as efficient, effective government programmes subject to strict oversight and evaluation. This is the general framework for the proposal put forward in this analysis of strategies for furthering productive development in open economies. As is customary in the documents prepared by the ECLAC secretariat, an integrated structural approach has been used. The study is composed of five sections comprising a total of 12 chapters. Part one (chapters 1 and 2); sets the analysis of national productive development strategies for open economies in its current international context. Specifically, chapter 1 looks at the basic traits of today's international economy. It then goes on to consider the current status of the international debate on issues that influence how much manoeuvring room is available to the countries for the design and implementation of their development policies. Chapter 2 describes the general features of the region's development process after nearly two decades of economic and institutional reforms. It also traces the ways in which the other topics examined in this document tie in with the conceptual framework of the development process. It concludes with a discussion of a number of strategic courses of action for the promotion of productive development in open economies. These lines of action revolve around three pivotal and mutually complementary elements: inclusion, modernization and the densification of the production apparatus. Part two (chapters 3 and 4); deals with the aspects of the macroeconomic environment and the financial system that have the greatest bearing on productive development and examines the links among economic growth, investment in infrastructure and the sustainable development of natural resources. Chapter 3 underscores the importance of stability, in the broad sense of the term, as a pillar for saving and investment, together with the crucial role played by countercyclical policies in buffering the effects of real and financial shocks on economic growth. This chapter also reviews the development of new risk-management instruments and mechanisms that make it possible to finance innovation and provide access to, in particular, long-term credit for small and medium-sized enterprises. Chapter 4 analyses investment in infrastructure and the sustainable development of natural resources. With respect to the former, the discussion deals with the balance between infrastructure supply and demand in the coming years, changes in public/private supply models and critical problems in the area of public regulation. In regard to the latter, an assessment is made of the relationship existing among the production structure, natural resources and the environment, as well as the challenges facing the countries and the opportunities open to them in terms of the sustainable utilization of natural resources, the introduction of innovations in the fields of biotechnology and clean production techniques, and the production of environmental and ecological goods and services of value to the entire planet. Part three (chapters 5 through 8); is devoted to a consideration of policies for stimulating productive development in open economies. Chapter 5 examines the major expansion recently seen in the region's foreign trade activity and the diversification of its exports in terms of both destination markets and the types and technological content of export products. It also looks at the various kinds of instruments that can be used to help the region improve its position within the international economy, including the growing number of trade agreements that have been signed in the past few years in order to broaden and consolidate market access. Chapter 6 presents an analytical description of the transition made from, first, supply-side and, later, demand-side technology policies to a model based on the use of the linkage between supply and demand to define the most suitable technological development path for each productive context. It then goes on to propose a typology of strategies for promoting innovation that takes into account the wide array of situations existing in the region. The concluding portion of this chapter offers guidelines for increasing the <b>coordination</b> <b>and</b> <b>complementarity</b> of the various types of policies for promoting innovation and discusses their characteristics and specific content. Chapter 7 explores the development and articulation of entrepreneurial capacities in the sphere of production. The concept of the entrepreneurial process which is implicit in measures and policies for the creation and modernization of business enterprises is described as it relates to three categories of firms: large businesses that tend to be more fully integrated into the global economy; small and medium-sized formally constituted firms, and informal microenterprises. The discussion then turns to the various policy measures that can be used to foster the formation of business linkages of various sorts. Chapter 8 considers the objective of strengthening the production structure by increasing the density of the production, technological and business apparatus. An overview of the policies employed to pursue this objective in the past is followed by a description of practices used as part of current strategies in the region. In addition to analysing some of the aspects of the follow-up and evaluation of their implementation and impact, policy guidelines are proposed for strengthening the production structure under the conditions now prevailing in the region. Part four of the document (chapters 9 and 10); looks at the conflict that the {{countries of}} the region have had to deal with in order to reconcile the flexibility required by an open economy in order to adapt to an ever-changing environment with the social protection required by the population in order to cope with the risks associated with a reorganization of the production structure. Chapter 9 examines trends and prospects in the region's labour markets, with emphasis on changes in the quality of employment. The development and current status of the labour market's institutional structure is outlined, and the possible contribution of job-creation and job-training policies to an improvement in working conditions and workers' economic security is assessed. Suggestions are then made concerning steps that could be taken to contribute to a form of flexible employment combined with social protection mechanisms based on a fiscally responsible social cohesion covenant. Chapter 10 expands upon the definition of this covenant to give it a dynamic dimension intended to ensure that the educational system will adapt to the challenges of competitiveness on an on-going basis. To this end, it is argued that measures should be adopted to upgrade the delivery and financing of educational services as a means of broadening access to the sector and boosting its productivity, attaining higher secondary-school graduation rates, gearing the educational system more closely to the labour market's requirements and narrowing the digital divide at the international and social levels. Part five (chapters 11 and 12); delves into the relationship between economic development and institutional modernization and the fundamental role that regional efforts can play in giving the {{countries of the}} region more manoeuvring room. Chapter 11 starts out with an analysis of how institutions have influenced economic growth and equity, and then moves on to an examination of the institutions associated with a market economy and the process of institutional change. After reviewing the morphology of institutions in open and increasingly interdependent economies, the way in which a political system processes reforms within the framework of democratic institutions is explored. The twelfth and final chapter looks at the current status of integration processes in the region. It assesses the important role played in the 1990 s by the region's four imperfect customs unions, both in terms of trade creation (in some cases with greater technological content); and in relation to the potential for cooperation on various fronts. It is noted that these processes tended to taper off in the late 1990 s and that more and more countries have decided to concentrate on concluding free trade agreements with developed countries or regions in order to gain access to those markets. The discussion concludes with a consideration of the policy options available to the countries of the region in this connection. We are hopeful that the proposals set forth here will encourage further analysis of a subject of such vast political, economic and social importance in the world of today and that they will serve as a stimulus for debate at this thirtieth session of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.

40|$|The {{enlargement}} of the EU from 15 to 27 member states {{has the potential to}} affect the whole direction and shape of EU policy with regard to development - both because of different priorities of the new Central and Eastern European (CEE) states and the issue of aid diversion to new and poorer states. This paper examines whether the CEE states have a fundamentally different approach to development and developing countries and whether this will lead to pressure to shift the policy in new directions over the longer term. In particular the paper explores the following questions: •	has enlargement altered the geographical focus of EU development policy? •	has enlargement altered strategic focus of EU development policy? •	What has been the impact of the CEE states on the precepts of <b>coordination,</b> <b>complementarity</b> <b>and</b> coherence (3 cs) in the EU's development co-operation policies and operations? •	How has the Commission responded to new challenges, in particular how have the different Directorate Generals of the European Commission (Development & External Relations) integrated the views of the CEE states into development policy?
