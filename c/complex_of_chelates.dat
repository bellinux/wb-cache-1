40|$|The {{anaerobic}} reaction <b>of</b> <b>chelated</b> protohaemin, {{a synthetic}} model compound of ferrihaemoglobin, with phenyldiazene produced a compound with the visible-absorption spectrum of a ferrihaemochrome.

Though the spectrum of the compound formed by the addition <b>of</b> phenyldiazene to <b>chelated</b> protohaemin is characteristic of a ferric porphyrin complex, this compound reacted with both toluene-p-sulphonylmethyl isocyanide and CO, which are strong ligands of ferrous porphyrins, to produce the corresponding ferrous complexes. These ligand-binding reactions indicated that the <b>complex</b> <b>of</b> <b>chelated</b> protohaem with phenyldiazene can behave either as a <b>complex</b> <b>of</b> a ferric porphyrin with phenyldiazenyl anion (C 6 H 5 N = N-) or a <b>complex</b> <b>of</b> a ferrous porphyrin with phenyldiazenyl radical (C 6 H 5 N = N.).

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the synthesis and characterisation of new examples of meso-n 1 -organometallic porphyrins. These porphyrins were originally encountered as catalytic intermediates in the C-C bond forming reaction on the porphyrin periphery using palladium catalysts. They {{have now become}} a research topic {{in their own right}} and no other examples of this type of organometallic porphyrins had been reported at the outset of this work. In Chapter 2, several examples of meso-palladioporphyrins were prepared in high yield using oxidative addition of the porphyrin-bromine bond to a suitable Pd(0) phosphine precursor. These phosphine precursors were prepared from Pd(PPh 3) 4 or Pd 2 dba 3 plus either PPh 3 or a chelating diphosphine. Several new examples of mono- and di palladium <b>complexes</b> <b>of</b> <b>chelating</b> diphosphines were prepared. Chapter 3 looks at the preparation of meso-platinioporpyrins and the insertion of various central metal ions into the porphyrin ligand. Pairs of cis- and transisomers <b>of</b> the Pt(II) <b>complexes</b> were isolated from the oxidative addition of Pt(PPh 3) 3 to the free base and Ni(II) bromoporphyrins. The cis-isomer converted to the trans upon heating. At room temperature the two isomers are geometrically stable and survive unchanged through column chromatography and slow recrystallisation. The central metal ion can be introduced either before or after the oxidative addition to Pt(0). However, it is preferable to insert the metal ion last as the <b>complexes</b> <b>of</b> Br(MDPP) are rather insoluble (especially that of MnCl) and are more difficult to handle than the common intermediate trans- [PtBr(H 2 DPP) (PPh 3) 2]. The oxidative addition of Pt(dba) 2 to meso-bromo-DPP in the presence of PPh 3 has also been shown to be an effective method of synthesising n 1 -organo platinum porphyrins in high yield. However, this method was unsuccessful when using chelating diphosphines. In Chapter 4, the physical properties of meso- metalloporphyrins are reported including electrochemistry, fluorescence spectroscopy and crystal structure determinations. The fluorescence intensities of the meso-substituted porphyrins (freebase and zinc complexes) are dramatically reduced in comparison with the unsubstituted porphyrins. This fluorescence quenching is a dramatic example of the "heavy atom effect". Electrochemical measurements of freebase and Ni(II) porphyrins indicate that the organometallic fragment is a strong electron donor. The visible absorption spectra for all Pd(II) and Pt(II) complexes are typical for diarylporphyrins. All groups other than H in the 5 - or 5 - and 15 -positions cause a red shift of the major absorption bands for both the free bases and central-metal complexes. The crystal structure studies <b>of</b> the Pt(II) <b>complexes</b> include the complexes, cis- [PtBr(MDPP) (PPh 3) 2] (M = H 2, Ni), trans-[PtBr(MDPP) (PPh 3) 2] (M = H 2, Ni, Zn and Co), trans-[PtCl(H 2 DPP) (PPh 3) 2] and trans-[PtBr(NiDPPBr) (PPh 3) 2]. In all these structures, the free bases are virtually planar while the metallo derivatives adopt a hybrid of the ruffled and saddled conformations. Chapter 5 contains the initial studies of chiral palladioporphyrins, using three different types <b>of</b> chiral <b>chelating</b> diphosphine ligands. These chiral palladioporphyrins are readily prepared by oxidative addition of the Pd(0) precursor with bromoporphyrin. The asymmetry of the chiral ligand is detectable at the remote B-pyrrole protons in all the chiral complexes as eight doublets are observed in 1 H NMR spectra. The chirality of these ligands in the porphyrin complexes induces circular dichroism in the region of the porphyrin electronic absorption.

All aqueous samples contained Fe(II) - and Fe(III) -NOM complexes, often in combination with Fe(III) (hydr) oxides that were associated with NOM. The variation in contribution from Fe-NOM and Fe (hydr) oxides was controlled by pH and total concentrations of NOM. The XAS spectra suggested formation <b>of</b> mononuclear Fe-NOM <b>complexes</b> consisting <b>of</b> <b>chelate</b> ring structures, but it could not be determined whether they originated solely from Fe(III) - or from a mixture of Fe(II) /Fe(III) -NOM complexes. Our collective results showed that the Fe speciation was highly variable across the different landscape elements and streams. This variation was manifested both in the distribution between mononuclear Fe-NOM complexes and Fe (hydr) oxides associated with NOM and between Fe(II) and Fe(III). These results highlight the complexity of Fe speciation in natural environmental systems and thus the challenges in interpreting Fe reactivity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{crystal and}} {{molecular}} {{structure and the}} stability of lead and calcium <b>complexes</b> <b>of</b> two <b>chelates</b> containing picolinate chelating groups in different geometries have been investigated in order to relate the ligand affinity and selectivity for lead over calcium with {{the ability of the}} ligand to accommodate a stereochemically active lone pair. The crystal structures <b>of</b> the lead <b>complexes</b> <b>of</b> the diprotonated and monoprotonated tripodal ligand tpaa 2 - show that the three picolinate arms of the tripodal ligand coordinate the lead in an asymmetric way leaving a gap in the coordination sphere to accommodate the lead lone pair. As a consequence of this binding mode, one picolinate arm is very weakly bound and therefore can be expected to contribute very little to the complex stability. Conversely, the geometry of the dipodal ligand H 2 dpaea is designed to accommodate the lead lone pair; {{in the structure of the}} [Pb(dpaea) ] complex the donor atoms of the ligand occupy only a quarter of the coordination sphere, reducing the sterical interaction between the lead lone pair with respect to the H 3 tpaa complexes. As a result, in the lead structures of H 2 dpaea all the ligand donor atoms are strongly bound to the metal ion leading to increased stability. The high value of the formation constant measured for the lead <b>complex</b> <b>of</b> the dipodal dpaea 2 - (log β 11 (Pb) = 12. 1 (3)) compared to the lower value found for the one of the tripodal tpaa 3 - (log β 11 (Pb) = 10. 0 (1)) provides direct evidence of the influence of the stereochemically active lead lone pair on complex stability. As a result, since the ligand geometry has little effect on the stability <b>of</b> the calcium <b>complex,</b> a remarkable increase in the Pb/Ca selectivity is observed for dpaea-(10 6. 6) compared to tpaa 3 - (10 1. 5), making the dipodal ligand a good candidate for application as extracting agent for the lead removal from contaminated water...|$|R

In {{the study of}} self-organization in aqueous systems <b>of</b> the <b>chelating</b> surfactants, alkyl-N-iminodiacetic acids, the acidic constants are determined {{and the influence of}} the alkyl chain length is discussed. The crystal structures of alkyl-N-iminodiacetic acids are determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. A short and strong hydrogen bond is identified in the structure, the oxygen-oxygen bond distance d(O(-H) [...] . O) = 2. 455 - 2. 480 Å, and the oxygen-hydrogen distance d(O-oxygen bond distance d(O-H) stretching frequency v(O-H) ≈ 720 cm⁻¹ in methyl-N-iminodiacetic acid. The implications of the short and strong hydrogen bond in the solid state when dissolved in water, as a function of degree of aggregation, in aqueous systems are discussed. The properties <b>of</b> <b>complex</b> formation between alkyl-N-iminodiacetic acids and a selection of hard or borderline metal ions are studied, calcium(II), chromium(III), iron(III), and zinc(II). The binding properties of the amine nitrogen atom in the chelating surfactant complexes are studied in solid state and aqueous systems by extended X-ray absorption spectroscopy, EXAFS. Calcium(II) and chromium(III) ions form octahedral complexes to oxygen atoms. Iron(III) ions form octahedral complexes, in solid as oxo-bridged dimers and in aqueous solution with four bond to oxygen and two bonds to nitrogen atoms. Zinc(II) ions are generally four-coordinated to oxygen atoms in the solid state, in aqueous solution and depending on pH bonding further nitrogen atoms at longer distances, up to a six-coordination...|$|R

Evidence is presented and reviewed which shows detrital concentration of heavy metals, radionuclides, and organochlorine insecticides. A study of a roadside marsh indicates that lead originating from automobile exhausts may reach concentrations as high as 1415 ppm on marshgrass detritus. We suggest that these elevated concentrations may, in turn, be passed on to detritivores which ingest the contaminated particles and experience desorption and assimilation of the poilutant within the digestive tract. Finally, potential mechanisms are listed which might explain detrital sorption; these include: microbial uptake (adsorption and metabolic absorption), association with detrital and microbial lipids, electrostatic adsorption in response to charges on the detritus particles, and formation <b>of</b> <b>complexes</b> and <b>chelates</b> at active sites on the organic molecules of the decomposing detritus...|$|R

Addition of H 3 B. dppm to [Cr(CO) (4) (nbd) ] (nbd = norbornadiene) affords [Cr(CO) (4) (eta(1) - H 3 B. dppm) ] {{in which}} the borane {{is linked to the}} metal through a single B - H - Cr interaction. Addition of H 3 B. dppm to [CpRu(PR 3) (NCMe) (2) ](+) (Cp = eta(5) -C 5 H 5) results in [CpRu(PR 3) (eta(1) - H 3 B. dppm) ][PF 6] (R= Me, OMe) which also show a single B - H - Ru interaction. Reaction with [CpRu(NCMe) (3) ](+) only resulted in a mixture of products. In contrast, with [Cp* Ru(NCMe) (3) ](+) (Cp* = eta(5) -C 5 Me 5) a single product is isolated in high yield: [Cp* Ru(eta(2) -H 3 B. dppm) ][PF 6]. This complex shows two B - H - Ru interactions. Reaction with L = PMe 3 or CO breaks one of these and the complexes [Cp* Ru(L) (eta(1) - H 3 B. dppm) ][PF 6] are formed in good yield.
