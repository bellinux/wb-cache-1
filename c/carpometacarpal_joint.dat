25|$|Bennett {{fracture}} is {{a fracture}} {{of the base}} of the first metacarpal bone which extends into the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint. This intra-articular fracture is {{the most common type of}} fracture of the thumb, and is nearly always accompanied by some degree of subluxation or frank dislocation of the <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joint.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{skeleton}} of the thumb {{consists of the}} first metacarpal bone which articulates proximally with the carpus at the <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joint</b> and distally with the proximal phalanx at the metacarpophalangeal joint. This latter bone articulates with the distal phalanx at the interphalangeal joint. Additionally, there are two sesamoid bones at the metacarpophalangeal joint.|$|E
50|$|The <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joints</b> {{of second}} through fifth digits are arthrodial. The {{movements}} permitted {{in the second}} through fifth <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joints</b> is most readily observable in the (distal) heads of the metacarpal bones. The range of motions in these joints decrease from the fifth to the second CMCs.|$|R

25|$|A {{primitive}} autonomization of {{the first}} <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joint</b> (CMC) may have occurred in dinosaurs. A real differentiation appeared perhaps 70 mya in early primates, while {{the shape of the}} human thumb CMC finally appears about 5 mya. The result of this evolutionary process is a human CMC joint positioned at 80° of pronation, 40 of abduction, and 50° of flexion in relation to an axis passing through the second and third CMC joints.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joint</b> of {{the thumb}} (pollex), {{also known as}} the first <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joint,</b> or the trapeziometacarpal joint (TMC) because it connects the {{trapezium}} to the first metacarpal bone, plays an irreplaceable role in the normal functioning of the thumb. [...] The most important joint connecting the wrist to the metacarpus, osteoarthritis of the TMC is a severely disabling condition; up to twenty times more common among elderly women than in average.|$|E
2500|$|Primatologists {{and hand}} {{research}} pioneers John and Prudence Napier defined opposition as: [...] "A movement {{by which the}} pulp surface of the thumb is placed squarely in contact with- or diametrically opposite to- the terminal pads of one {{or all of the}} remaining digits." [...] For this true, pulp-to-pulp opposition to be possible, the thumb must rotate about its long axis (at the <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joint).</b> Arguably, this definition was chosen to underline what is unique to the human thumb.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTObjective: Wrist {{arthrodesis}} is {{a surgical}} procedure that {{should always be}} considered in cases of pathological conditions in which anatomical and functional structures are altered. In general, the results are very satisfactory, particularly for pain relief, and {{in the majority of}} cases, there is considerable functional improvement. Various techniques have been described, with different methods of internal fixation, most of which include the <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joints</b> in the fusion. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the results from wrist arthrodesis using a technique that is simpler, more biological, less expensive, and does not involve the <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joints.</b> Methods: Fifteen patients with wrist arthrodesis were evaluated (six with sequelae from trauma, four with rheumatoid arthritis, three with Kienbock grade IV, one with Preiser and one with panarthrosis). The technique consisted of using an iliac bone plate and internal fixation with Kirschner wires, avoiding the <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joints.</b> Results: The evaluation was based on consolidation time (93 % in seven weeks); movements of the fingers and pronosupination; pinch and grasp strength; functional evaluation through the DASH, pain and patient satisfaction questionnaires. In general, the results were similar to those of other, more aggressive techniques, and the non-inclusion of the <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joints</b> did not affect the final result. Conclusion: Wrist arthrodesis with fixation using Kirschner wires and an iliac bone plate, preserving the <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joints,</b> gives good or excellent results that are not inferior to those of other techniques that have been described. However, it presents major advantages over other methods: it is less aggressive and cheaper, and does not have the inconvenience and complications associated with the use of plates and screws...|$|R
25|$|Osteoarthritis of the <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joints</b> {{is a type}} {{of joint}} disease that results from {{breakdown}} of joint cartilage and underlying bone. When it affects the thumb it is termed trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis.|$|R
50|$|Of {{the joints}} between the carpus and metacarpus, the <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joints,</b> only the saddle-shaped joint of the thumb offers {{a high degree}} of {{mobility}} while the opposite is true for the metacarpophalangeal joints. The joints of the fingers are simple hinge joints.|$|R

50|$|Carpometacarpal bossing (or metacarpal/carpal bossing) is a small, {{immovable}} mass of bone on {{the back}} of the wrist. The mass occurs in one of the joints between the carpus and metacarpus of the hand, called the <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joints,</b> where a small immovable protuberance occurs when this joint becomes swollen or bossed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{prolongation}} {{between the}} greater and lesser multangulars, or {{that between the}} lesser multangular and capitate, is, owing {{to the absence of}} the interosseous ligament, often continuous with the cavity of the <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joints,</b> sometimes of the second, third, fourth, and fifth metacarpal bones, sometimes of the second and third only.|$|R
40|$|Injury to the <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joints</b> is rare. The strong ligamentous {{attachments}} and carpal bone alignment readily resist displacement. To the authors’ knowledge, {{there are}} no studies evaluating postoperative recovery regimens of carpometacarpal fracture dislocations. The present study describes a postoperative hand therapy regimen that used a novel carpometacarpal brace permitting early mobilization...|$|R
50|$|The flexor pollicis brevis flexes {{the thumb}} at the metacarpophalangeal joint, {{as well as}} flexion and medial {{rotation}} of the 1st metacarpal bone at the <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joint.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>carpo{{metacarpal}}</b> <b>joint</b> {{is usually}} {{found at the}} base of the second and third metacarpal bones at the point where they meet the small bones of the wrist.|$|E
50|$|The chief {{action of}} {{abductor}} pollicis longus is to abduct the thumb at the <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joint,</b> thereby moving the thumb anteriorly. It also assists in extending and rotating the thumb.|$|E
30|$|Carpometacarpal dislocations {{are seen}} {{following}} high-energy trauma. The increased mobility on the ulnar side may predispose to the noted greater frequency of injury. The {{mechanism of injury}} in our case {{would have been a}} direct thrust over the knuckles that forced the metacarpals to rotate from the dorsal to the volar direction, causing dislocation of the middle three <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joints.</b>|$|R
30|$|Volar carpometacarpal dislocations of {{the fingers}} of the ulnar side of the hand are a {{relatively}} uncommon injury [1, 2], but those involving the middle three metacarpals are rarer still. Diagnosis of this unusual form of injury requires {{a high level of}} suspicion, careful examination, and good radiography. Dislocations at the finger <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joints</b> are usually high-energy injuries that are commonly seen in boxers and motorcyclists [3, 6]. The diagnosis can easily be missed due to other serious injuries. These injuries account for < 1 % of all hand injuries [4] and are frequently overlooked or missed. Disability of the hand is severe in untreated cases or in those where treatment has been delayed. Volar dislocations of these joints have been reported on rare occasions, but to our knowledge no such dislocations of just the second, third, and fourth <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joints</b> have been placed on record. The case presented here is therefore of significant interest.|$|R
50|$|The Palmar carpo{{metacarpal}} ligaments (or volar) are {{a series}} of bands on the palmar surface of the <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joints</b> that connect the carpal bones to the second through fifth metacarpal bones. The second metacarpal is connected to the trapezium. The third metacarpal is connected to the trapezium, to the capitate, and to the hamate. The fourth and fifth metacarpals are connected to the hamate.|$|R
50|$|Opponens digiti minimi: Inserts on {{the medial}} surface of {{metacarpal}} V; Flexes metacarpal V at <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joint</b> when little finger is moved into opposition with tip of thumb; deepens palm of hand.|$|E
50|$|Abduction of {{the thumb}} {{is defined as}} the {{movement}} of the thumb anteriorly, a direction perpendicular to the palm. The abductor pollicis brevis does this by acting across both the <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joint</b> and the metacarpophalangeal joint.|$|E
50|$|Opponens minimi digiti {{serves to}} flex and {{laterally}} rotate the 5th metacarpal about the 5th <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joint,</b> as when bringing little finger and thumb into opposition. It is innervated by the deep {{branch of the}} ulnar nerve.|$|E
40|$|The {{pattern of}} joint {{involvement}} on conventional radiographs {{and the four}} hour gammacamera image of 99 Tc HMDP bone scans were studied in 33 patients with generalised nodal osteoarthritis. Both techniques showed the predominant involvement of the distal interphalangeal, scaphotrapezial, and first <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joints.</b> Some joints were abnormal just on one investigation: either x ray or scan alone. Others showed a marked dissimilarity in the severity of involvement on x ray compared with scan. This discrepancy between x ray and scan suggests that the scan is imaging a different process than the radiograph and offers {{a different way of}} assessing change in osteoarthritis...|$|R
50|$|The {{posterior}} carpometacarpal ligament {{consists of}} a series of bands on the posterior surface of the <b>carpometacarpal</b> <b>joints.</b> They connect the carpal bones to the bases of the second to fifth metacarpals. The second metacarpal bone is connected to the trapezium, trapezoid, and capitate. The third meacarpal is connected to the capitate. The fourth metacarpal is connected to the capitate and hamate, and the fifth metacarpal is connected to the hamate.|$|R
