500|$|Battle – In battle mode, {{the player}} fights against up to 3 (or up to 15 with LAN) human-controlled opponents using items {{scattered}} throughout a battle arena. There {{is the traditional}} balloon-popping battle game, in which the player must use items to pop an opponent's three balloons while defending their own. Players can also steal items from one another by speeding towards them with a mushroom or star. In Co-op battles, the player {{in the back of}} the kart can perform a slide-attack on another driver, which can also steal balloons. Additionally, two new games have been implemented: the first involves capturing a Shine Sprite and maintaining possession of it for a certain amount of time, usually starting out with 55 to 60 seconds. Each time the Shine Sprite is lost, the <b>counter</b> <b>will</b> somewhat reset the time. For instance, if a player is able to keep possession of the Shine Sprite for only 30 seconds, the counter would reset to 40 instead of 60. The other mode involves throwing Bob-ombs at each other to collect points. With two players, 3 points are needed to win, but when playing with 3 or 4, 4 points are required to win. If two or more players throw a bomb at each other in unison, no points will be awarded to anybody. In a way, it's similar to a tie. As in previous installments, the battle arenas are enclosed (the exception being Tilt-A-Kart), with a varying layout and a replenishing arsenal of items. (2P-16P only) ...|$|E
2500|$|The formal {{equivalence}} applies only {{in so far}} as computer arithmetic also follows the axia of mathematics, in particular that x + 1 > x. Actual computer arithmetic suffers from the overflow of limited representations so that for example in sixteen-bit unsigned arithmetic, 65535 + 1 comes out as zero, because 65536 cannot be represented in unsigned sixteen-bit. Similar problems arise for other sizes, signed or unsigned. Compiler writers will handle the likes of for counter := 0 to 65535 do ... next counter, possibly by producing code that inspects the state of an [...] "overflow" [...] indicator, but unless there is some provision for the equivalent checking when calculating counter := counter + 1; the while-loop equivalence will fail because the <b>counter</b> <b>will</b> never exceed 65535 and so the loop will never end - unless some other mishap occurs.|$|E
50|$|Counters {{are usually}} {{programmed}} with fixed intervals that determine {{how long the}} <b>counter</b> <b>will</b> count before it signals. The interval determines how long the <b>counter</b> <b>will</b> count before it will output a signal.|$|E

50|$|This game's {{score and}} hyper {{mechanics}} are highly {{similar to those}} of DaiOuJou. The biggest basic difference in scoring is that the chain hit <b>counter</b> <b>will</b> not reset immediately when the chain meter empties; the <b>counter</b> <b>will</b> instead drop by 25% and decrease very quickly until the chain continues. The chain meter is also more easily kept above zero by using the laser.|$|E

50|$|The {{objective}} of this mode is to capture outposts. As soon as a team controls 50% of all outposts, the opposing team's <b>counter</b> <b>will</b> start to count down. The first team to have their counter reach zero, loses.|$|E
50|$|After Control Word and COUNT is loaded, {{the output}} will remain high until the counter reaches zero. The <b>counter</b> <b>will</b> then {{generate}} a low pulse for 1 clock cycle (a strobe) - {{after that the}} output will become high again.|$|E
50|$|Axle {{counters}} {{have problems}} maintaining correct counts when train wheels stop {{directly on the}} counter mechanism; {{this is known as}} 'wheel rock'. This can prove problematic at stations or other areas where cars are shunted, joined and divided. Also, where main lines have switches to siding, spur or loop tracks extra <b>counters</b> <b>will</b> need to be deployed to detect trains entering or exiting the line, where with track circuits such infrastructure needs no special attention.|$|R
50|$|By far {{the most}} common US civil defense meter on the market today. This is a simple ion chamber {{radiological}} survey meter, specifically designed for high-radiation fields for which Geiger <b>counters</b> <b>will</b> give incorrect readings (see above). Survey meters do not read alpha or beta radiation. They work by radiation penetrating {{the case of the}} unit and the enclosed ionization chamber to produce a visible reading between 0.1R/h and 500R/h (X0.1, X1, X10, and X100 scales).|$|R
50|$|The {{strategy}} {{applied to}} the playing of hands {{can be used to}} detect a possible counter since very few players employ perfect playing strategy. Furthermore, card <b>counters</b> <b>will</b> use perfect playing strategy, then they will suddenly alter it and make unique strategy deviations that can be a dead giveaway. Plays such as splitting tens, doubling soft 18/19/20, standing on 15/16, and surrendering on 13/14, when basic strategy says otherwise, may be a sign of a card counter.|$|R
50|$|Mode 0 is {{used for}} the {{generation}} of accurate time delay under software control. In this mode, the <b>counter</b> <b>will</b> start counting from the initial COUNT value loaded into it, down to 0. Counting rate is equal to the input clock frequency.|$|E

40|$|We have {{designed}} and constructed a broad band (. 95 <$< 1. 00) focusing Cherenkov counter with large angular acceptance (± 40) {{for use in}} particle identification in a double armed spectrometer experiment at the Brookhaven National Laboratory AGS. To achieve this large angular acceptance while maintaining a resolution in particle velocity of AS 3 %. 015 we have employed a new method of light collection. This light collection scheme will be discussed and general applications of this method to improve the velocity resolution of existing differential Cherenkov <b>counters</b> <b>will</b> be presented...|$|R
50|$|Ring {{counters}} {{are used}} in hardware logic design (e.g. ASIC and FPGA design) to create complicated finite state machines. A binary <b>counter</b> <b>will</b> require an adder circuit which is substantially more complex than a ring counter. Additionally, the worst case propagation delay on an adder circuit will be proportional {{to the number of}} bits in the code (due to the carry propagation). The propagation delay of a ring <b>counter</b> <b>will</b> be a constant regardless of the number of bits in the code. The complex combinational logic of an adder can create timing errors which may result in erratic hardware performance. Last, ring counters with Hamming distance 2(or more) allow the detection of single bit upsets that can occur in hazardous environments.|$|E

As a result, the airport’s capacity will increase up to 1,700 passengers per hour. In August 2013, reconstruction of the international terminal was commenced. According to the design, the number of check-in <b>counters</b> <b>will</b> increase to 8, immigration control counters to 10, and an additional baggage carousel is to be installed. Besides, a children playground will be constructed within the terminal building.|$|R

50|$|V0 {{is made of}} two {{arrays of}} {{scintillator}} counters set {{on both sides of}} the ALICE interaction point, and called V0-A and V0-C. The V0-C counter is located upstream of the dimuon arm absorber and cover the spectrometer acceptance while the V0-A <b>counter</b> <b>will</b> be located at around 3.5 m away from the collision vertex, on the other side.|$|E
50|$|The 100 {{nanosecond}} granularity implemented within OpenVMS and the 63-bit {{absolute time}} representation (the sign bit indicates absolute time when clear and relative time when set) should allow OpenVMS trouble-free time computations up to 31-JUL-31086 02:48:05.47. At this instant, all clocks and time-keeping operations in OpenVMS will suddenly fail, since the <b>counter</b> <b>will</b> overflow and start from zero again.|$|E
50|$|The aging {{algorithm}} is {{a descendant of}} the NFU algorithm, with modifications to make it aware of the time span of use. Instead of just incrementing the counters of pages referenced, putting equal emphasis on page references regardless of the time, the reference counter on a page is first shifted right (divided by 2), before adding the referenced bit {{to the left of}} that binary number. For instance, if a page has referenced bits 1,0,0,1,1,0 in the past 6 clock ticks, its referenced <b>counter</b> <b>will</b> look like this: 10000000, 01000000, 00100000, 10010000, 11001000, 01100100. Page references closer to the present time have more impact than page references long ago. This ensures that pages referenced more recently, though less frequently referenced, will have higher priority over pages more frequently referenced in the past. Thus, when a page needs to be swapped out, the page with the lowest <b>counter</b> <b>will</b> be chosen.|$|E
50|$|During 2012 the Phase III {{expansion}} plan was updated {{to include a}} new Central Concourse reconfiguration plan. In 2014, the Airport Trust selected Option 2a, which includes only the central terminal improvements. The $3.6M project will create a new central checkpoint {{in the center of}} the check-in hall. Two new greeter lobbies will be created where existing check points exist. The expansion will slightly reduce the space utilized by Sonic in the food court. The restrooms in the area will also be relocated to the nearby Osage room. The Southwest ticket <b>counters</b> <b>will</b> be relocated further east.|$|R
50|$|If {{the event}} to be counted is already in {{electronic}} form, simple interfacing to the instrument {{is all that is}} required. More complex signals may need some conditioning to make them suitable for counting. Most general purpose frequency <b>counters</b> <b>will</b> include some form of amplifier, filtering and shaping circuitry at the input. DSP technology, sensitivity control and hysteresis are other techniques to improve performance. Other types of periodic events that are not inherently electronic in nature will need to be converted using some form of transducer. For example, a mechanical event could be arranged to interrupt a light beam, and the counter made to count the resulting pulses.|$|R
