5000|$|Backstopping {{prevents}} {{a loaded}} inclined conveyor from running {{back when the}} drive system is stopped. The outer race of the sprag clutch is fixed to the machine frame, usually via a torque arm. The inner race rotates freely in the forward direction of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>drive.</b> When the machine tries to run backward, the sprag clutch prevents this motion. In this application the sprag clutch is often called a [...] "backstop" [...] or [...] "holdback".|$|E

50|$|Unlike many {{gasworks}} {{sites in}} Australia that were either demolished or stripped after closure, the vertical retort house in Launceston still retained {{most of its}} original machinery after it was abandoned. Both the electric coke extractor eccentric and <b>conveyor</b> <b>drive</b> remained intact within the building along {{with most of the}} fourth floor machinery. The waste heat boiler on sublevel 3 had been reduced in size due to salvage operations in the 1980s as with the waste heat boiler on the first floor (ground level) which was also partially dismantled. The original brick furnaces (producer blocks) {{at the front of the}} building were mostly dismantled with the exception of a now free-standing, brick archway which used to allow the conveyor to pass through the furnace block. Original lighting and electronic equipment still remained within the building both on the first floor and the electrical room on the 3rd floor at the back of the building. The coke extractors on the underside of the retort blocks were in various levels of salvage with the most complete being located at the rear of the building.|$|E
5000|$|Inside, {{the coal}} was {{transported to the}} top level where it was {{deposited}} in a long hopper at the top level of the building (which also contains the <b>conveyor</b> <b>drive</b> and water tank). From the hopper, the coal was fed via a single chute into the vertical retort block which was then divided into 8 separate retorts, where it was heated by furnaces (and later an additional steel furnace in the back room) located {{on the first floor}} (ground level). The extracted gas was collected in two parallel [...] "Collector Mains" [...] running {{along the top of the}} retort block. Accumulated tar and liquor was drained from the collector mains into a small liquor separating tank on the 3rd floor on the western side of the building. The collected gas was forced through the retort governor (recently removed for scrap) and into the foul main that runs down the back of the retort house where it was purified elsewhere on the site. Like the Horizontal Retorts, the Vertical Retort was run on Newcastle Coal imported from New South Wales. In the 1950s, modifications were made to the gasworks to allow the site to use Fingal Coal from the Fingal Valley in north east Tasmania.|$|E
40|$|The <b>conveyor</b> chain <b>drive</b> {{system which}} {{included}} four sprockets, four flat bars (chain guides) and one conveyor chain had been assembled into commercial software, MSC. ADAMS. The conveyor chain was connected with rollers for {{running on the}} chain guides.

50|$|Three phase {{induction}} motors {{are probably}} {{the most common type of}} three phase load and are used in a variety of equipment including refrigeration, pumps, air conditioning, <b>conveyor</b> <b>drives</b> as well as their more obvious applications. The de-rating effects of overvoltage and three phase imbalance on AC motors are well known. Excessive overvoltage results in saturation of the iron core, wasting energy through eddy currents and increased hysteresis losses. Drawing excessive current results in excess heat output due to copper losses. The additional stress of overvoltage on motors will decrease motor lifetime.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the results of the {{experimental}} study of influence of installation faults on tractive ability of belt <b>conveyor</b> intermediate <b>drive.</b> The alternative of experimental simulation of cyclic displacement relative to cross displacement of belts is suggested. The displacement is created by forced cocking of joint of the upper bench contour. The study procedure and applied equipment are described. The physical ‚Äòobservation‚Äô method of relative rest and sliding zones of belts is suggested. This method is based on capturing temperature difference at entry and exit points of the zones which is produced through the implementation of the principle of belt dry friction within the specified zone. Experimental confirmation of the existence of relative rest and sliding zones in the contact area of so called ‚Äòload‚Äô and tractive belts is obtained from the studies. Experimental confirmation of the hypothesis on sequencing of these zones formation in the contact area of belts is obtained as well. The significance of influence of probable installation faults on tractive ability of belt <b>conveyor</b> intermediate <b>drive</b> is shown in practice. There are the findings regarding the need of taking into account the stated phenomenon when designing belt conveyor...|$|R
