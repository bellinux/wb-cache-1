40|$|We {{present a}} space <b>charge</b> <b>code</b> that is self consistent, massively parallelizeable, and {{requires}} very little communication between computer nodes; making the calculation almost embarrassingly parallel. This method is {{implemented in the}} code COSY Infinity where the differential algebras used in this code {{are important to the}} algorithm's proper functioning. The method works by calculating the self consistent space charge distribution using the statistical moments of the test particles, and converting them into polynomial series coefficients. These coefficients are combined with differential algebraic integrals to form the potential, and electric fields. The result is a map which contains the effects of space charge. This method allows for massive parallelization since its statistics based solver doesn't require any binning of particles, and only requires a vector containing the partial sums of the statistical moments for the different nodes to be passed. All other calculations are done independently. The resulting maps can be used to analyze the system using normal form analysis, as well as advance particles in numbers and at speeds that were previously impossible...|$|E
40|$|Laser driven accelerators {{are capable}} of {{producing}} multi nC, multi MeV electron beams with transverse and longitudinal sizes {{on the order of}} microns. To investigate the transport of such electron bunches, a fast and fully relativistic space <b>charge</b> <b>code</b> which can handle beams with arbitrarily large energy spread has been developed. A 6 -D macroparticle model for the beam is used to calculate the space charge fields at each time step. The collection of macroparticles is divided into longitudinal momentum bins, each with a small spread in relative momentum. The macroparticle distribution in each momentum bin is decomposed into ellipsoidal shells in position space. For each shell, an analytical expression for the electrostatic force in the bin rest frame is used. The total space charge force acting on one macroparticle in the lab frame is then the vector sum of the Lorentz-transformed forces from all the momentum bins. We have used this code to study the evolution of typical beams emerging from the plasma in the two most popular schemes, i. e., the self-modulated laser-wakefield-accelerator, where the laser pulse size is many times the plasma wavelength (L >> lr), and the colliding pulse laser-wakefield-accelerator regime where L-lr and two counter propagating laser pulses are used to inject electrons into the wakefield...|$|E

[...] Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2017 Prostitution arrest records provided by 11 different {{law enforcement agencies}} in the Kansas City area {{during the years of}} 2011 through 2015 are used as a means for analysis of commercial sexual exploitation (CSE) within the Kansas City Metropolitan Statistical Area. Arrests were coded into three types of CSE involvement: victim, buyers and traffickers. Demographical information on age, sex, and race of arrestees revealed that CSE victims were younger than buyers and traffickers and {{were more likely to be}} female. Statistically significant relationships were found between race and type of CSE involvement, a finding that is consistent with literature regarding the highly racialized nature of CSE. Capture recapture statistical methods, a technique used to estimate hard to reach populations, were used to produce a population estimate of adult CSE victims within the areas of the reporting police agencies (an area that covers 86. 1 % of the Kansas City MSA population). Using these methods, it is estimated that the number of adult CSE vicitms in this area ranges from 2, 830 to 3, 275 persons.

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{the best}} of the authors’ knowledge, {{admission}} of children under observation status in community hospitals has not been examined. The hypothesis of this study was that there has been an increase in observation <b>charge</b> <b>code</b> use over time and variations in the application of observation charge codes across hospital types. MethodsThis was a cross‐sectional analysis of 5  years (2007 through 2011) of administrative claims data from Michigan residents enrolled in Medicaid, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Michigan preferred provider organization, and Blue Cross Network health maintenance organization compiled into a single data set. Emergency department (ED) visits to facilities in Michigan made by children (younger than 18  years) were selected. Observation‐prone ED visits were identified based on the presence of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐ 9 ‐CM) codes. Counts of observation‐prone ED visits were determined and descriptive statistics were calculated. Changes over time in the proportion of visits with observation charge codes by hospital type were assessed with chi‐square analysis. ResultsThe observation‐prone ICD‐ 9 ‐CM codes were identified in 881, 622 ED visits made by children to 142 Michigan facilities during the 5 ‐year study period. Overall, the vast majority of visits (n =  646, 499; 91. 0 %) with the selected ICD‐ 9 ‐CM codes resulted in discharge from the ED without associated observation or inpatient charge codes. Among the 64, 288 visits that resulted in admission for observation or inpatient care, observation charge codes without inpatient charge codes were applied to 22, 933 (35. 7 %) admissions, observation and inpatient charge codes were applied to 4, 756 (7. 4 %) admissions, and inpatient charge codes without observation charge codes were applied to 36, 599 (56. 9 %) admissions. Hospitals with pediatric ED and inpatient services (Type 1 and Type 2 hospitals) had higher proportions of ED visits that went on to admission for observation or inpatient care (15. 9 and 10. 7 %) than hospitals without pediatric ED services (Type 3 and Type 4 hospitals; 7. 2 and 3. 7 %). The proportion of admissions that had observation charge codes for all hospital types increased over time, most prominently among Type 1 and Type 2 hospitals. ConclusionsThe application of observation charge codes to Michigan children with observation‐prone conditions has increased over time across all hospital types. There is a need to evaluate pediatric observation care in diverse settings to compare the effectiveness of different models...|$|E

30|$|There are {{a number}} of {{limitations}} to our study. As a retrospective chart review rather than a prospective investigation, the information was culled from sources that were at times incomplete.

On the other hand, as a single-center study, potential differences in clinical and billing practices could be minimized. Although a comprehensive charge profile of each patient was generated, trends in the timing of charges could not be obtained.

40|$|Evaluating {{spacecraft}} charging {{behavior of}} a vehicle in the space environment requires knowledge of the material properties relevant to the charging process. Implementing surface and internal charging models requires a user to specify a number of material electrical properties including electrical resistivity parameters (dark and radiation induced), dielectric constant, secondary electron yields, photoemission yields, and breakdown strength in order to correctly evaluate the electric discharge threat posed by the increasing electric fields generated by the accumulating charge density. In addition, bulk material mass density and/or chemical composition must be known in order to analyze radiation shielding properties when evaluating internal charging. We will first describe the physics of spacecraft charging and show how uncertainties in material properties propagate through spacecraft charging algorithms to impact the results obtained from charging models.
