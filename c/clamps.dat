5|$|It {{was common}} {{practice}} for ore freighters, even in foul weather, to embark with not all cargo <b>clamps</b> locked {{in place on}} the hatch covers. Maritime author Wolff reported that depending on weather conditions, all the <b>clamps</b> were eventually set within one to two days. Captain Paquette of Wilfred Sykes was dismissive of suggestions that unlocked hatch <b>clamps</b> caused Fitzgerald to founder. He said that he commonly sailed in fine weather using the minimum number of <b>clamps</b> necessary to secure the hatch covers.|$|E

5|$|Indiana was {{commissioned}} on 20 November 1895 {{under the command}} of Captain Robley D. Evans. After further trials, the ship joined the North Atlantic Squadron {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Francis M. Bunce, which conducted training exercises along the East Coast of the United States. In late 1896, both main turrets broke loose from their <b>clamps</b> in heavy seas. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they swung from side to side with the motion of the ship, until they were secured with heavy ropes. Heavier <b>clamps</b> were installed, but in February 1896, while conducting fleet maneuvers with the North Atlantic squadron, the Indiana encountered more bad weather and started rolling heavily. Her new captain, Henry Clay Taylor, promptly ordered her back to port for fear the <b>clamps</b> would break again. This convinced the navy that bilge keels—omitted during construction because, with them, the ship could not fit in most American dry docks—were necessary to reduce the rolling, and they were subsequently installed on all three ships of the Indiana-class.|$|E

The conventional diode <b>clamping</b> inverter suffers from such problems as dc link unbalance, indirect <b>clamping</b> {{of the inner}} devices, turn-on snubbing of the inner dc rails as well as series association of the <b>clamping</b> diodes etc. It is due largely to these problems that {{the application of the}} conventional diode <b>clamping</b> inverter in practice has been deterred, in spite of the growing discussion in the literature. An auxiliary resistive <b>clamping</b> network solving the indirect <b>clamping</b> problem of the inner devices is also discussed for both the new and conventional diode <b>clamping</b> inverter.

5|$|Other Mycenas that {{resemble}} M.adscendens include M.alphitophora and M.stylobates. The former is distinguished from M.adscendens by a stem base {{that is not}} swollen or disc-like, the latter by its larger and sturdier fruit body and lack of granules on the cap. A poorly known Japanese species, M.cryptomeriicola, is similar to M.adscendens, but has non-amyloid spores and lacks <b>clamps.</b> M.nucicola is most reliably distinguished from M.adscendens by microscopic characteristics: M.nucicola has four-spored basidia, clamp connections are rare in the hyphae of the gill tissue, and the spores are less broad (typically 4.2–5µm). The Finnish species M.occulta grows on the decaying needles of Norway spruce and Scots pine. It differs from M.adscendens in that its gills do not form a pseudocollarium, it lacks <b>clamps</b> in the hyphae and cells of the hymenium, and the terminal cells in its cap cuticle are densely covered with protuberances.|$|E
5|$|Sanmee {{and colleagues}} {{mention that the}} eastern North American species A.frostiana resembles A.rubrovoltata {{slightly}}, but the former has short grooves {{at the edge of}} a yellowish-orange cap, slightly larger spores, a yellow volva, and <b>clamps</b> at the basidial bases. Roger Heim reported A.frostiana as occurring in Thailand, but this was probably a misidentification of A.rubrovolvata.|$|E
5|$|The July 26, 1977, USCG Marine Casualty Report {{suggested}} that the accident was caused by ineffective hatch closures. The report concluded that these devices failed to prevent waves from inundating the cargo hold. The flooding occurred gradually and probably imperceptibly throughout the final day, finally resulting in a fatal loss of buoyancy and stability. As a result, Fitzgerald plummeted to the bottom without warning. Video footage of the wreck site showed that most of her hatch <b>clamps</b> were in perfect condition. The USCG Marine board concluded that the few damaged <b>clamps</b> were probably the only ones fastened. As a result, ineffective hatch closure caused Fitzgerald to flood and founder.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{influence}} of small <b>clamping</b> eccentricity on the measurement and evaluation of involute profile, analyzes the cause of <b>clamping</b> eccentric error, establishes a <b>clamping</b> eccentric error compensation model, and introduces a computing method of <b>clamping</b> eccentric parameters.

The results of the <b>clamping</b> eccentricity error compensation experiment show that the <b>clamping</b> eccentric error compensation model can compensate measurement results to the results attained under operating conditions, and achieve precision measurement of involute profiles.

5|$|The {{original}} {{design of the}} Indiana class included bilge keels, but with keels they would not fit {{in any of the}} American drydocks at the time, so they were omitted during construction. This meant a reduction in stability and caused a serious problem for Indiana, when both main turrets broke loose from their <b>clamps</b> in heavy seas a year after being commissioned. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they swung from side to side with the motion of the ship, until they were secured with heavy ropes. When the ship encountered more bad weather four months later, she promptly steamed back to port for fear the <b>clamps</b> would break again. This convinced the navy that bilge keels were necessary and they were subsequently installed on all three ships.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: To date, the {{incidence}} and clinical relevance of arterial stenosis at <b>clamp</b> sites after femoropopliteal bypass surgery is unknown. METHODS: Ninety-four patients underwent a femoropopliteal bypass {{in which the}} arterial inflow and outflow <b>clamp</b> sites were controlled by the Fogarty-Soft-Inlay <b>clamp</b> and marked with an hemoclip. The number of pre-existing atherosclerotic segments, <b>clamp</b> force, and <b>clamp</b> time were recorded and the occurrence of a stenosis at the <b>clamp</b> site was determined. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 83 months, a significant stenosis was confirmed at 23 of the 178 <b>clamp</b> sites (12. 9 %; 95 % confidence interval 8. 4 to 18. 8). The mean number of pre-existing atherosclerotic segments (P =. 28) and the mean <b>clamp</b> force (P =. 55) was similar between the groups with and without a stenosis. There {{was a significant difference}} regarding <b>clamp</b> time between the group with and without a stenosis (38 minutes and 26 minutes, P =. 001). CONCLUSION: Arterial <b>clamping,</b> even with the Fogarty-Soft-Inlay <b>clamp,</b> can lead to <b>clamp</b> stenosis and seems {{to be related to the}} duration of <b>clamping,</b> but not to pre-existent atherosclerotic burden.

5|$|Amanita rubrovolvata {{produces}} a white to cream-colored spore print. The spores are spherical or nearly so, and typically measure 7.5–9.0 by 7.0–8.5µm.

The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are club-shaped, four-spored (rarely two-spored), and measure 25–44 by 10–14µm.

5|$|Amanita onusta may be {{confused}} with A.cinereoconia because of the similar gray powdery veil remnants on the cap surface.

A.cinereoconia also smells distinctly of chloride of lime. Another similar species is A.costaricensis, found only in Costa Rica.

Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA suggests that R.botrytis is closely related to R.rubripermanens and R.rubrievanescens, and that these species form a clade that is sister (sharing a recent common ancestor) to the false truffle genus Gautieria, the most derived group within the studied taxa.|$|E

There were to be two independent endless cables, one between City station and Elephant and Castle moving at 10mph, and the other between Elephant and Castle and Stockwell, where the gradient was less, at 12mph.
