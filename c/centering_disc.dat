40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} optic <b>disc</b> <b>center</b> displacement on retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) measurement determined by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The optic <b>disc</b> <b>center</b> was manipulated at 1 -pixel intervals in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions. According to the manipulated optic <b>disc</b> <b>center</b> location, the RNFL thickness data were resampled: (1) at a 3. 46 -mm diameter circle; and (2) between a 2. 5 -mm diameter circle and 5. 4 -mm square. Error was calculated between the original and resampled RNFL measurements. The tolerable error threshold of the optic <b>disc</b> <b>center</b> displacement was determined by considering test-retest variability of SD-OCT. The unreliable zone was defined as an area with 10 % or more variability. The maximum tolerable error thresholds of optic <b>disc</b> <b>center</b> displacement on the RNFL thickness map were distributed from 0. 042 to 0. 09 mm in 8 directions. The threshold shape was vertically elongated. Clinically important unreliable zones were located: (1) at superior and inferior region in the vertical displacement; (2) at inferotemporal region in the horizontal displacement, and (3) at superotemporal or inferotemporal region in the diagonal displacement. The unreliable zone pattern and threshold limit varied according to the direction of optic disc displacement. Optic <b>disc</b> <b>center</b> displacement had a considerable impact on whole RNFL thickness measurements.

30|$|In this article, we {{presented}} a new method for localizing the <b>center</b> of optic <b>disc.</b> The average {{distance between the}} estimated and the manually identified optic <b>disc</b> <b>centers</b> is 17 and 26 pixels in [9] and 23.2 and 119 pixels in [11] for DRIVE and STARE datasets, respectively. These values in the proposed method are 15.9, 11.4, and 8.9 pixels for DRIVE, STARE, and local datasets, respectively. Therefore, the estimated optic <b>disc</b> <b>centers</b> obtained using the proposed method are more accurate in comparison to other algorithms such as methods introduced in [9, 11, 12]. In this article, we used the histograms of some optic discs and in presence of pathological regions and exudates in retinal images, and we could determine the <b>center</b> of optic <b>disc</b> correctly. Most of the counterpart methods perform well {{when there are no}} pathological regions or exudates in retinal images. In this article, the first four retinal images in DRIVE dataset were used to obtain their histograms as template, using more retinal images such as retinal images in STARE and local datasets may improve the effectiveness of our proposed method. Also to decrease the running time of our proposed method, we can combine our proposed method with other methods. For example, as we know template matching method proposed in [8] fails in situation like pathological regions and exudates exit and also the accuracy of template matching method for localizing optic <b>disc</b> <b>center</b> of retina images without any pathological regions and exudates is low. Therefore, we can use template matching method for retina images to obtain candidate regions that probability of existing optic disc in them is more than other regions in retina images. Then, instead of applying our proposed method on the whole of retina images, we apply it to candidate regions to obtain optic <b>disc</b> <b>center.</b> Therefore, the running time of our proposed method will considerably decrease. In future work, we use optic <b>disc</b> <b>center</b> obtained as the first step for localizing the boundary of optic disc and also we can use the optic <b>disc</b> <b>center</b> for recognition algorithm in our future research for human recognition based on the retinal images.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} fully-automatic localization and segmentation of 3 D intervertebral discs (IVDs) from MR images. Our method contains two steps, where we first localize {{the center of each}} IVD, and then segment IVDs by classifying image pixels around each <b>disc</b> <b>center</b> as foreground (<b>disc)</b> or background. The disc localization is done by estimating the image displacements from a set of randomly sampled 3 D image patches to the <b>disc</b> <b>center.</b> The image displacements are estimated by jointly optimizing the training and test displacement values in a data-driven way, where we take into consideration both the training data and the geometric constraint on the test image. After the <b>disc</b> <b>centers</b> are localized, we segment the discs by classifying image pixels around <b>disc</b> <b>centers</b> as background or foreground. The classification is done in a similar data-driven approach as we used for localization, but in this segmentation case we are aiming to estimate the foreground/background probability of each pixel instead of the image displacements. In addition, an extra neighborhood smooth constraint is introduced to enforce the local smoothness of the label field. Our method is validated on 3 D T 2 -weighted turbo spin echo MR images of 35 patients from two different studies. Experiments show that compared to state of the art, our method achieves better or comparable results. Specifically, we achieve for localization a mean error of 1. 6 - 2. 0 mm, and for segmentation a mean Dice metric of 85 %- 88 % and a mean surface distance of 1. 3 - 1. 4 mm...|$|R
40|$|The general contact {{problem of}} a disc {{squeezed}} between jaws of arbitrary curvature is considered employing Muskhelishvili's complex potentials. Taking advantage of the general solution introduced, the closed-form expressions for the stresses along strategic loci (loaded rim, loaded diameter, <b>disc's</b> <b>center)</b> are obtained, {{in terms of the}} ratio ρ of the disc's to the jaw's curvature. Then, the effect of ρ (as well as that of the relative stiffness of the disc's and jaw's materials dictating the contact arc) on the stress distribution along these loci is explored. It is concluded that, for both smooth contact (zero friction) and contact with friction, the role of the jaw's curvature is significant not only along the disc-jaw contact arc (as it could be expected), but also all along the loaded diameter. On the other hand, it is indicated that the stress field at the <b>disc's</b> <b>center</b> is more or less insensitive to the jaw's curvature assuming that ρ lies within the range (0, 0. 67) or in other words within the limits defined by the two standardized suggestions, i. e. that of American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) (plane loading platens with ρ =  0) and that of International Society for Rock Mechanics (ISRM) (curved jaws with ρ =  0. 67). The upper limit of this range is a kind of compromise between the need to make the stress field at the <b>disc's</b> <b>center</b> independent of the boundary conditions while keeping {{at the same time the}} contact angle large enough to reduce the stress concentration and the risk for premature fracture initiation far from the <b>disc's</b> <b>center.</b> For jaws with radius of curvature exceeded by that suggested by ISRM, the stress field at the <b>disc's</b> <b>center</b> is significantly influenced. Especially for jaws with radius approaching that of the disc, the stress field at the <b>disc's</b> <b>center</b> is dramatically distorted rendering Hondros' formula inapplicable and the test results erroneous...|$|R
