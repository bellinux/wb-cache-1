5|$|Although less used, the {{separability}} {{assumption is}} <b>considered</b> <b>more</b> general because every stochastic process has a separable version. It {{is also used}} {{when it is not}} possible to construct a stochastic process in a Skorokhod space. For example, separability is assumed when constructing and studying random fields, where the collection of random variables is now indexed by sets other than the real line such as -dimensional Euclidean space.|$|E
5|$|As for {{its earlier}} productions, Century 21 {{launched}} {{a number of}} merchandising campaigns based on Joe 90, which included toy cars and comic strips featuring the continuing adventures of Joe McClaine. The series was syndicated in the United States in 1969, re-broadcast in the UK during the 1990s and released on DVD in most regions in the 2000s. The idea of a live-action film adaptation of Joe 90 has been <b>considered</b> <b>more</b> than once since the 1960s, but without further development.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the case}} of its {{predecessor}} Landsat 1, the satellite's payload included two remote sensing instruments, the Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) and the Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS). The specifications for these instruments were identical to those of the instruments carried on Landsat 1. The data acquired by the MSS was <b>considered</b> <b>more</b> scientifically useful than the data returned from the RBV, which was rarely used and considered only for engineering evaluation purposes.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} remaster was mostly positive. Several critics {{noted that some}} features like the inventory system and the insistence on having to revisit previously explored areas have not aged very well, but generally agreed that the remaster was a solid revival of a classic.

Additionally, fancy rats are quite independent, loyal and easily trained, earning them comparison to both cats and dogs. This comparison is merited given fancy rats are <b>considered</b> <b>more</b> intelligent than any other domesticated rodent.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the United States was {{completing}} a retreat from Vietnam. A staunchly anti-communist Indonesia was {{considered by the}} United States to be an essential counterweight, and friendly relations with the Indonesian government were <b>considered</b> <b>more</b> important than a decolonisation process in East Timor. The United States also wanted to maintain its access to deep water straits running through Indonesia for undetectable submarine passage between the Indian and Pacific oceans.|$|E

In the following sections, the paper describes methodology, used data, modeling techniques and finally, results and conclusion.|$|R
5|$|It {{was later}} {{claimed by the}} Nazis that Wessel also wrote the music to the song, but it was <b>considered</b> <b>more</b> likely that the tune was in reality adapted from a World War I German Imperial Navy song, and was {{probably}} originally a folk song. The authorship of the melody was finally determined by a German court in 1937 as not by Wessel.|$|E
5|$|Listeners {{unfamiliar}} with contemporary Christian music (CCM) often assume that Loder sings hymn-style music. Her career {{is unusual in}} that it began in CCM; most young musicians choose music genres such as country and pop, which are generally <b>considered</b> <b>more</b> likely to bring commercial success. Loder has asserted that she chose CCM because it gives purpose to her music; many of her songs are about God, but {{they may also be}} interpreted as being about other subjects.|$|E
5|$|Severus Alexander {{held him}} in high esteem {{and made him}} his consul again. His Roman History spans nearly a millennium, from the arrival of Aeneas in Italy until the year 229. As a {{contemporary}} of Elagabalus, Cassius Dio's account of his reign is generally <b>considered</b> <b>more</b> reliable than the Augustan History, although {{by his own admission}} Dio spent the greater part of the relevant period outside of Rome and had to rely on second-hand information.|$|E

5|$|Sources often <b>considered</b> <b>more</b> {{credible}} {{than the}} Augustan History include the contemporary historians Cassius Dio and Herodian. Cassius Dio lived {{from the second}} half of the 2nd century until sometime after 229. Born into a patrician family, he spent the greater part of his life in public service. He was a senator under emperor Commodus and governor of Smyrna after the death of Septimius Severus. Afterwards he served as suffect consul around 205, and as proconsul in Africa and Pannonia.|$|E
5|$|Ten years later, in 123 BC, Gaius {{took the}} same office as his brother, as a tribune for the plebeians. Gaius was more {{practical}} minded than Tiberius, and so was <b>considered</b> <b>more</b> dangerous by the senatorial class. He gained support from the agrarian poor by reviving the land reform programme and from the urban poor with various popular measures. He also sought support from the second estate, those equestrians who had not ascended to become senators.|$|E

5|$|The band-pass of {{an atomic}} line filter is usually {{equal to the}} Doppler profile of the vapor cell, the natural range of {{frequencies}} at which a vapor cell will be excited by a pure light source.

This value is less for larger atoms at lower temperatures, a system <b>considered</b> <b>more</b> ideal.|$|E
5|$|The church {{features}} two stories: {{while the}} upper story {{was certainly the}} church proper and the place of liturgy, {{the role of the}} lower story is unclear. Its construction may have been necessitated due to the unfavourable rocky terrain, or it may have served as a tomb or a storage facility. The latter is <b>considered</b> <b>more</b> likely because no human remains have been discovered inside, even though the lower stories of similar churches were commonly used as tombs.|$|E

5|$|Among the {{supporting}} roles, {{one of the}} highest-profile pieces of casting was Malcolm McDowell as Soho porn baron Benny Barrett. Barrett appears in scenes across various episodes from 1966 through to 1979, but the production could only afford him for three weeks. This was because McDowell was then a resident in the United States. All of McDowell's scenes were therefore shot by Stuart Urban {{as part of the}} first block of filming, as opposed {{to the rest of the}} production which was filmed roughly chronologically. This was <b>considered</b> <b>more</b> than worthwhile, however, for the prestige of being able to use an actor such as McDowell, predominantly a film actor who rarely did television work.|$|E
