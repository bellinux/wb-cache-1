40|$|The {{dominant}} view of {{what caused}} the crises in Thailand and elsewhere holds that local corruption {{in the form of}} “crony capitalism ” is among the prime culprits. This paper seeks to redirect focus away from the alleged crime of commission as a primary cause of recent crises toward the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission</b> in not interrogating more fully both the instability of finance capitalism and the resulting distributional consequences of that instability. A comparison with the recent American experience suggests crises are an enduring feature of capitalism and not the product of “corrupt ” Southeast Asian business practices. This comparison suggests as well that redistribution of income over the course of such episodes may very well be quite regressive. Together this perspective suggests that when western interest groups, exercising their influence through the international financial community, advocate for what is in essence a redirection of entitlements, questions of conflict of interest—arguably lying {{at the heart of the}} problem with cronyism—must be redirected as well...|$|E
50|$|<b>Crimes</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission</b> are a {{cause in}} overfishing. People {{turn a blind}} eye to this situation. Logbooks do not report true catches. And even if vessels are caught, the fines for vessels that overfish are often not enforced. ‘Black fish’ is the name given to illegal catches. According to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, 50% of hake is illegal, 60% of cod is illegal. The {{observation}} of independent observers on fishing vessels that operate illegally are not made public without great censorship, for fear of causing offence.|$|R
5000|$|In a 1997 {{letter to}} a Ramakrishna Mission {{official}} (published in 2001), Narasingha Sil added a negative view of Kripal's scholarship and proficiency in the Bengali. [...] Sil argued that Kripal translated Bengali terms through Bengali-English dictionaries by picking the meanings that would be most appropriate to make his point, disregarding the primary, secondary, tertiary meanings. He also argued that Kripal was unable even to converse in Bengali. [...] In another 1997 article, Sil charged Kripal with [...] "willful distortion and manipulation of sources", and with, while criticising Swami Nikhilananda's translation of the Kathamrita, having [...] "committed similar <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission</b> and commission to suit his thesis." ...|$|R

The comment focuses on the criteria adopted by the Court in order to identify a corporation's main office for tax purposes (and with particular respect to the case in which the corporation belongs to a group of companies) and on the prongs and limits of aiding and abetting conducts in relation to <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{material}} {{author of}} the infraction {{is the person who}} physically performs the actions necessary to make up the criminal action. In the case of a murder this would be the person who struck the fatal blow. For <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission</b> the material author would be the person who didn't move when he had the possibility to rescue someone. Under the Ancien Régime a collective responsibility was often envisaged. This concept disappeared in the codes, although jurisprudence sometimes makes use of a concept of collective guilt, but this is most apparent in conspiracy cases. (Article 450-1) Indeed, in a conspiracy each participant in the group is considered the principal {{author of the}} infraction.|$|R
40|$|Recently, Situational Crime Prevention Theory (SCPT) {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} offender-based theories <b>of</b> white-collar <b>crime.</b> This paper uses the results of a cross-case analysis of 23 criminal investigations <b>of</b> environmental <b>crime</b> in the Netherlands to explore the fruitfulness of SCPT as a method of scientific study <b>of</b> environmental <b>crime</b> and the development of prevention strategies. This analysis shows that most environmental <b>crimes</b> are <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission,</b> while SCPT is designed for predatory <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> commission. In addition, while it is concluded that SCPT is helpful in analysing opportunities for environmental crime, it is difficult to draw innovative prevention strategies on the basis of SCPT, since most suggestions have already been covered in contemporary models for environmental regulation. © The Author 2013.

40|$|Criminologists tend {{to study}} crimes that include active {{behaviors}} by offenders. Much less attention {{is given to}} inaction - or crimes that are defined {{by the absence of}} behaviors. A number <b>of</b> different <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission,</b> however, are included within state statutes. In recent times, a great deal of legislative attention has been directed towards whether Good Samaritan laws should be developed- laws that require bystanders to help those who are imperiled. This article describes a pilot study involving a survey of 134 "bystanders" to determine their attitudes about helping and their support for laws mandating that bystanders help crime victims. Results show that the sample overwhelmingly indicated that they would help others themselves, but there was mixed support for laws requiring that individuals help those in need. Support for Bad Samaritan laws was related to age and education. Implications are provided. ...|$|R
40|$|Vigilantism {{is a crime}} often {{associated}} with parochial gangs and rampaging mobs. Yet the conditions that catalyse vigilantism are beyond the remit of these groups, and instead implicate states in wilful acts of exploitation and criminal neglect. Across much of South Africa, the poverty and lawlessness created by apartheid has been left unaddressed in the nearly twenty years since democratic transition. Elites and others with sufficient means isolate themselves behind increasingly sophisticated layers of private security. Outside the walls, vigilantes emerge as what is often considered a necessary evil, providing {{one of the only}} options for security and also an avenue of protest identity. This article examines South African vigilantism through the prism <b>of</b> state <b>crime,</b> arguing that the state, and particularly its agents, the South African police, are guilty <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission,</b> and <b>of</b> fostering a vigilante culture whereby private citizens have few alternatives but to turn upon one another in the name of justice. 18 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The neural {{basis of}} {{intentionally}} deciding between different response alternatives {{has been extensively}} investigated and associated with the rostral cingulate zone (RCZ). However, from daily experience {{we know that the}} decision whether to do something is often prior to the decision what to do. This raises the fundamental question whether the decision to act and the decision not to act can be considered as functionally equivalent. Interestingly, in the legal domain such an equivalence is implicitly assumed by punishing <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission.</b> The aim <b>of</b> the current study was to explicitly test this assumption by comparing the neural representation of intentional actions with intentional non-actions. Our results suggest, that weighing whether to act or not involves similar areas of the brain, namely RCZ and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, independent of the outcome of this decision. This finding strongly supports the assumption that intentionally not acting can be considered as a mode of action...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{similarities and}} differences in media discourses relating to methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at three important points {{in the development of}} the bacterium and its perception by the public over the last decade. We analyse three increasingly large sets of texts from the national media using a variety of complementary qualitative and quantitative methods. As such this paper exploits, develops and empirically assesses an emerging methodological trend in applied linguistics, namely the convergence of critical metaphor analysis, with corpus linguistics and science and technology studies. Using this, the study identifies a shifting media narrative that involves changes in dramatis personae over the decade. First, personified forces of nature, doctors and hospitals are engaged in a battle of evil against good, but also intelligence over stupidity. Second, we are presented with victims of personified bacterial forces and doct! ors and hospitals cast as perpetrators <b>of</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission</b> by not cleaning hands or wards. Third, the malignant forces of politics try to exploit the evil forces of nature for their own ends while a mediator between the doctors and the potential victims of MRSA, emerges and is given political and symbolic power: the modern matron.

40|$|The Voluntary Act Requirement (“VAR”) is the {{fundamental}} predicate for imposing legal punishment. Punishing {{solely on the basis}} of evil thoughts or a villainous character is impermissible. The VAR also embodies the notion that we must not punish someone for conduct over which she lacked sufficient control. But why not punish someone for conduct that was not within her control? One answer is retributivist—it would be unjust to do so because that defendant could not have been morally responsible for, and therefore could not deserve punishment for, what she did. Agent causalism is a contentious view about how criminal defendants voluntarily act according to which the defendants themselves cause their free, morally responsible actions, as opposed to events or states of affairs involving them, their brains, their circumstances, and so forth. This article argues that for retributivist justifications of the VAR to be plausible, agent causalism must be true. Agent causalism might be false, and if it is, then retributivism could not play any role in justifying our fundamental legal precondition for ever imposing any criminal liability upon anyone. This article does not argue that agent causalism is false, however. It elaborates and renders plausible an agent causalist position, and it shows how that position could handle types of cases that notoriously pose challenges to the VAR—cases involving complex unconscious conduct, cases involving <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission,</b> and cases involving habitual conduct...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} of its occurrence in most criminal justice systems, wrongful conviction remains underdeveloped from a criminological perspective. The result of a confluence of factors and actors, wrongful conviction stands as evidence that criminal justice systems are not immune to error. Amongst the different circumstances in individual cases, the state (or those acting on its behalf) is one constant actor implicated in wrongful conviction of the innocent. Recognizing this consistency, wrongful conviction {{has the potential to be}} examined through existing understandings <b>of</b> state <b>crime</b> and enter more robust discussions within critical and orthodox criminology. By expanding upon existing arguments relevant to state crime, this article suggests a typology of wrongful conviction by placing it on a continuum <b>of</b> state <b>crime</b> from acts <b>of</b> <b>omission</b> to commission. In doing so, this article further develops a theoretical argument demonstrating the relevance of wrongful conviction within the state crime &# 039;spectrum&# 039;, adding to the understanding of the problem of wrongful conviction...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Department of Justice {{is under}} fire for failing to prosecute banks that caused the 2008 {{economic}} meltdown because they are too big to jail. Prosecutors have long neglected to hold corporate executives accountable for chronic mistakes that kill and injure workers and customers. This book, {{the first of its}} kind, analyzes five industrial catastrophes that have killed or sickened consumers and workers or caused irrevocable harm to the environment. From the Texas City refinery explosion to the Upper Big Branch mine collapse to the destruction of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig and extending to incidents of food and drug contamination that have killed or injured hundreds, the root causes of these preventable disasters include <b>crimes</b> <b>of</b> commission and <b>omission.</b> Although federal prosecutors have made a start on holding low-level managers liable, far more aggressive prosecution is appropriate as a matter of law, policy, and justice. Written in accessible and jargon-free language, this book recommends innovative interpretations of existing laws to elevate the prosecution <b>of</b> white-collar <b>crime</b> at the federal and state levels.
