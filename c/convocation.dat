5|$|<b>Convocation</b> of the Diet.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford {{remained}} on the university senate until 1927, {{when he was elected}} Chancellor. The position was the titular head of the university, and its primary duty was presiding over convocations. According to Rutherford biographer Douglas Babcock, this was the honour that Rutherford prized most. He was acclaimed to the position every four years until his death. It has been estimated that he awarded degrees to more than five thousand students. His final <b>convocation,</b> however, was marred by controversy: in 1941, a committee of the university senate recommended awarding an honorary degree to Premier William Aberhart. Aberhart was pleased, and happily accepted University President William Alexander Robb Kerr's invitation to deliver the commencement address at <b>convocation.</b> However, a week prior to <b>convocation</b> the full senate—responsible for all university academic affairs—met, and voted against awarding Aberhart a degree. Aberhart rescinded his acceptance of Kerr's invitation (and later removed the senate's authority—except, ironically, the authority to award honorary degrees) and Kerr resigned in protest. Rutherford was mortified, but presided over <b>convocation</b> nonetheless.|$|E

Virtually every academic department has an award to present to a senior of that major. Next the President of the college awards each Summa Cum Laude graduate; within this elite group the Chancellor's medal is awarded to the graduate with the highest academic grade point average.|$|E

50|$|In 1919 the two <b>convocations</b> {{approved}} a constitution {{for the proposed}} National Assembly of the Church of England in which the laity of each province would have full participation along with the four houses of the <b>convocations</b> themselves. They also petitioned Parliament that the new Assembly might {{have the right to}} transmit legal measures to Parliament where they would either be {{approved a}}s they stood and then receive the royal assent (and so become part of the law of the land) or rejected. This was granted {{at the end of the}} same year. The <b>convocations</b> lost none of their rights and the Assembly could neither issue doctrinal statements nor purport to define the doctrine of the Church of England. However, by the Synodical Government Measure 1969 the overlapping functions of the Assembly and the <b>convocations</b> were virtually eliminated by the establishment of the General Synod of the Church of England to which almost all their functions and powers were transferred. The <b>convocations</b> still exist, in part because their approval is required for certain legislative proposals and in part because the House of Bishops and the House of Clergy of the General Synod are constituted by the members of the corresponding houses of the <b>convocations.</b>|$|R

5|$|Confederated sejm (Sejm skonfederowany) first {{appeared}} in 1573 (all <b>convocation</b> and election sejms were confederated), and became more popular in the 18th century as a counter to the disruption of liberum veto.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular sessions of the general sejm, {{in the era of}} electable kings, beginning in 1573, three special types of sejms (<b>convocation,</b> election, and coronation sejms) handled the process of the royal election in the interregnum period. In total, 173 sejms met between 1569 and 1793.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Convocations</b> {{have always}} been {{exclusively}} clerical assemblies. However, in 1885 the <b>Convocations</b> agreed {{to the establishment of}} parallel Houses of Laity elected by the lay members of the diocesan conferences. These were not part of Convocation; they had no constitutional status and were merely advisory. At {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century, both <b>Convocations</b> together with their respective houses of laity began to meet as a Representative Council which however had no legal authority or position. This was superseded in 1920 by the Church Assembly which was given the right to propose measures to Parliament by the [...] "Enabling Act of 1919". The <b>Convocations</b> still exist and their members constitute the two clerical houses of the General Synod but, apart from some residual and formal responsibilities, all legal authority is now vested in the Synod which was established in 1970.|$|R
50|$|When the {{separate}} Seimas for Lithuania was officially abolished in 1569, it adopted {{the name of}} Lithuanian <b>Convocations</b> and continued to meet until the partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795. It debated matters concerning the Grand Duchy of Lithuania or tried to establish a common position among Lithuanian delegates before departing for the Sejm of the Commonwealth. The <b>convocations</b> retained basic structures (upper and lower houses) and procedures of the Seimas: each powiat could send only two representatives. <b>Convocations</b> were called by the Grand Duke, who also ratified its decisions and included them in official law books.|$|R
