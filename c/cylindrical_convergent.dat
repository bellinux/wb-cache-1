40|$|An intense {{heavy ion}} beam {{is a very}} {{promising}} driver to study equation-of-state (EOS) properties of matter under extreme conditions of density, pressure and temperature. Theoretical estimates suggest that an insulator-to-metal transition may take place in hydrogen at pressures of a few Mbars, densities of 1 − 2 g/cm 3, and temperatures of a few thousand Kelvin. The use of an intense heavy ion beam with an annular focal spot, has been proposed in order to drive a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>convergent</b> shock wave allowing for compression of matter to high densities and high pressures [1]. It has been recently suggested that such an annular focal spot can be generated by a rotating beam [2]. We have carried out analytic and numerical simulation work to determine the minimum rotation frequency necessary to achieve acceptable level of symmetry [3, 4]. Our study ha...|$|E
40|$|Spherical or <b>cylindrical</b> <b>convergent</b> {{shock waves}} in imploding {{materials}} {{are one of}} the most effective ways to produce extremely high pressures, densities and temperatures, hardly attainable in plane shock waves generated by chemical high explosives or by the impact of high velocities objects. Pressure of the order of tens of megabars, densities many times greater than the normal density of solids and temperatures of hundreds of thousands degree can be easily produced in the convergence central region of the imploding shock wave. In this work we perform a hydrodynamic analysis of a spherical mass of lead imploded by an external constant pressure of 1 Mbar acting on its surface. The aim is to monitor the rise of pressure, density, velocity and temperature with the convergence and reflection of the shock wave at the centre. The analysis was carried out by a hydrodynamic code and by making use of the three-term equation of state for solids. This equation of state takes into account the elastic pressure, the thermal pressure of atoms and the thermal pressure of electrons in solids submitted to strong shock compressions...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} pulsed power driven, {{exploding}} copper wire array experiments conducted to generate <b>cylindrical</b> <b>convergent</b> shockwaves in water employing μs risetime currents > 550 [*]kA in amplitude and with stored energies of > 15 [*]kJ—a substantial increase over previous results. The experiments {{were carried out}} on the recently constructed Mega-Ampere-Compression-and-Hydrodynamics facility at Imperial College London in collaboration with colleagues of Technion, Israel. 10 [*]mm diameter arrays consisting of 60 [*]×[*] 130 [*]μm wires were utilized, and the current and voltage diagnostics of the load region suggested that ∼ 8 [*]kJ of energy was deposited in the wires (and the load region close to the wires) during the experiments, resulting {{in the formation of}} dense, highly resistive plasmas that rapidly expanded driving the shockwaves in water. Laser-backlit framing images of the shockfront were obtained at radii 50 : 1. Framing images and streak photographs showed that the velocity of the shockwave reached ∼ 7. 5 [*]km s− 1 at 0. 1 [*]mm from the axis. 2 D hydrodynamic simulations that match the experimentally obtained implosion trajectory suggest that pressures > 1 Mbar are produced within 10 [*]μm of the axis along with water densities of 3 gcm− 3 and temperatures of many 1000 [*]s of Kelvin. Under these conditions, Quotidian Equation of State suggests that a strongly coupled plasma with an ionization fraction of ∼ 0. 7 would be formed. The results represent a “stepping stone” in the application of the technique to drive different material samples into high pressure, warm dense matter regimes with compact, university scale generators, and provide support in scaling the technique to multi-mega ampere currents...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>convergent</b> <b>cylindrical</b> {{shock wave}} {{unleashed}} by the explosion produces a rapid contraction (greater than 1 km/s) {{of the central}} cylinder, compressing the magnetic field, and creating an inductive current, as per the explanation above (the speed of contraction permits, to first approximation, the neglect of Joule losses and the consideration of the cylinder as a perfect conductor).|$|R
40|$|Base {{pressures}} {{were measured}} in flight on fin-stabilized bodies of revolution {{with and without}} rocket chambers and with and without a converging afterbody. The Mach number range covered was between 0. 7 and 1. 2. Results show that presmres over the center portion of the bases of mcdels with rocket chambers were higher (less suction) than edge pressures, whereas the center base pressures on models witho’~t b rocket chsnibers were lower than edge pressures. The effects of rocket charibers on edge pressures were not, in general, as appreciable as the effects on the pressures measured over the center portion of. the bases. The results further show that changing from a <b>cylindrical</b> to a <b>convergent</b> afterbody decreased base drag markedly and {{in this particular case}} caused the base drag to become negative at Mach numbers below l. 0 ~...|$|R
40|$|The noise {{radiation}} characteristics of multi-cycle pulse detonation engine {{with and without}} ejector were investigated under different operating frequencies utilizing gasoline as fuel and air as oxidizer. The straight <b>cylindrical</b> ejector with <b>convergent</b> inlet geometry was coaxially installed at different axial locations relative to the exit of the detonation tube. In all the experiments, the equivalence ratios of gasoline–air mixture and the fill fraction were 1. 2 and 1. 0, respectively. The experimental results implied that the addition of ejector could drastically change the far-field acoustic performance of pulse detonation engine exit and the peak sound pressure level of noise radiation was a strong function of the ejector axial position. But the peak sound pressure level was not sensitive to the operating frequencies which varied from 10 to 25 [*]Hz. The pulse sound pressure level, however, increased {{with the increase in}} operating frequencies. The far-field jet-noise measurements of the pulse detonation engine-ejector system also showed that ejector could decrease the peak sound pressure level of pulse detonation engine. The maximum reduction was approximately 8. 5 [*]dB. For the current pulse detonation engine test conditions, an optimum ejector position was found to be a downstream axial placement of x/DPDE [*]=[*] 0. 5...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} nozzle {{geometry}} on diesel spray characteristics were studied in a spray chamber under evaporating conditions using three single-hole nozzles, one <b>cylindrical</b> and two <b>convergent,</b> designated N 1 (outlet diameter 140 μm, k-factor 0), N 2 (outlet diameter 140 μm, k-factor 2) and N 3 (outlet diameter 136 μm, k-factor 2). Spray experiments were performed with each nozzle at two constant gas densities (15 and 30 kg/m 3) and an ambient temperature (673 K) at which evaporation occurs, with injection pressures ranging from 800 to 1600 bar. A light absorption and scattering method using visible and UV light was implemented, and shadow images of liquid and vapor phase fuel were recorded with high-speed video cameras. The cylindrical nozzle N 1 yielded larger local vapor cone angles than the convergent nozzles N 2 and N 3 at both gas densities, {{and the difference}} became larger as the injection pressure increased. The vapor phase penetration values for nozzle N 1 and N 3 were quite similar and always lower than those for N 2. This {{is consistent with the}} impingement measurements, which showed that the momentum flux of nozzle N 1 was only slightly greater than that of nozzle N 3, while that of nozzle N 2 was substantially greater. The vapor volume fractions measured along the spray’s center line were well explained by the one-dimensional transient diesel jet model, indicating that diesel spray vaporization is controlled by turbulent fuel-air mixing...|$|R
