40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the influence of type and content of <b>chemical</b> <b>foaming</b> agent on the dynamic mechanical properties of high density polyethylene-flax fiber composites. Composites were prepared via melt mixing in an internal mixer, and then foamed using single-stage batch foaming method. Two type of <b>chemical</b> <b>foaming</b> agents including azodicarbonamide (ADC) and sodium bicarbonate (SB) were considered at three levels of 0, 2 and 4 per hundred resins (phr). The amount of flax fiber and coupling agent for all formulations was fixed at 60 % and 2 phr, respectively. Static mechanical tests including flexural and tensile were performed on samples. The dynamic mechanical properties such as storage modulus, loss modulus and damping factor of composites were investigated in the temperature range of - 60 to 150 0 C at a step of 5 0 C and frequency of 1 Hz. Morphology of the samples was also evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results indicate that the <b>chemical</b> <b>foaming</b> agent substantially increased cell size and reduced cell density and mechanical strength of composites. Moreover, the lowest mechanical strength was observed in foamed composites with SB. SEM confirmed that the type and content of <b>chemical</b> <b>foaming</b> agent had significant influence on density reduction of foamed composites. Finally, by increase in the <b>chemical</b> <b>foaming</b> agent content, the storage modulus and loss modulus of samples decreased. However, on addition of <b>chemical</b> <b>foaming</b> agent to composites, the damping factor was increased.

50|$|The {{original}} foam was {{a mixture}} of two powders and water produced in a foam generator. It was called <b>chemical</b> <b>foam</b> because of the chemical action to create it. In general, the powders used were sodium bicarbonate and aluminium sulfate, with small amounts of saponin or liquorice added to stabilise the bubbles. Hand-held foam extinguishers used the same two chemicals in solution. To actuate the extinguisher, a seal was broken and the unit inverted, allowing the liquids to mix and react. <b>Chemical</b> <b>foam</b> is a stable solution of small bubbles containing carbon dioxide with lower density than oil or water, and exhibits persistence for covering flat surfaces. Because it is lighter than the burning liquid, it flows freely over the liquid surface and extinguishes the fire by a smothering (removal/prevention of oxygen) action. <b>Chemical</b> <b>foam</b> is considered obsolete today because of the many containers of powder required, even for small fires.|$|E

50|$|The {{carbon dioxide}} is trapped by the foam {{stabilizer}} and creates a thick foam which will float on top of hydrocarbon fuels and seal off access to atmospheric oxygen, smothering the fire. <b>Chemical</b> <b>foam</b> was unsuitable for use on polar solvents such as alcohol, as the fuel would mix with and break down the foam blanket.

40|$|A {{new concept}} of <b>chemical</b> <b>foaming</b> is {{proposed}} for the preparation of geopolymers with fine porosity. The use of an interactive powder mixture of gas releasing agent and carrier particles, potentially combines the benefits of small point sources of gas with easy homogenization in the fresh geopolymer. This concept was exploited here for the preparation of porous flyash-based geopolymers. The interactive powder mixture was a SiC powder containing reactive submicron FeSi/FeSi 2 particles. Premature foaming was avoided due to prolonged induction period and slow reaction rate of the active phase. Samples were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, mercury porosimetry, tree-point bending tests and thermal conductivity measurements. In addition, total porosity was determined using measured apparent and real densities. It was found that fine pore structure (diameter 140 Â± 80 Î¼m) not normally obtained using <b>chemical</b> <b>foaming,</b> was achieved in a reproducible manner with this approach...|$|R
