5|$|On 2 May, Totti <b>came</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> {{bench and}} scored from a free kick to help Roma {{to come from}} behind and achieve a 3–2 away win over Genoa; this was his 21st goal from a free kick in Serie A, which put him {{alongside}} Baggio as the joint all-time fourth-highest scorer of free kicks in Serie A history, behind only Alessandro Del Piero, Andrea Pirlo, and Siniša Mihajlović. Totti <b>came</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bench {{in each of the}} past five Serie A games and contributed four goals and an assist. On 8 May, Totti <b>came</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bench to set up Roma's final goal in a 3–0 home win over Chievo in his 600th Serie A appearance, becoming the third player ever to reach this milestone.

On 7 June, he renewed his contract for another year, stating that he would be retiring at the end of the 2016–17 season; he also revealed he had signed a six-year contract as Roma's technical director once the season ends.|$|E

5|$|In the Belmont, Paynter led {{for most}} of the race until the final furlong when Smith <b>came</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> rail, {{allowing}} winner Union Rags to slip through and win by a neck. Paynter had already fended off two challengers during the race, and Smith had switched his whip from his right hand to his left in an attempt to fend off a late challenge from Atigun; Smith considered his decision to be an error that cost him the race.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{opponent}} in the fourth round was Leeds United. The match was played at Elland Road on 27 January 2001 {{in front of a}} near-capacity crowd of 37,108.

Barmby then turned provider for Liverpool's second, setting-up Heskey to score.|$|E

5|$|The 2011–12 season saw Totti {{initially}} receive few starts under Roma's {{new manager}} Luis Enrique, as the club's early struggles continued.

5|$|A {{pre-season}} unofficial friendly match provided Tomkins {{his first}} experience against top-flight opposition as he <b>came</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bench during Lee Briers' testimonial match in a 30–22 loss to Warrington. Noble followed this up by providing Tomkins, aged 19, {{with his first}} team début on 12 May against Whitehaven in a fifth round Challenge Cup match. Tomkins became the first player in rugby league history to score five tries on his first-grade debut, scoring his first three to complete a hat-trick within the first twelve minutes, as Wigan scored eighteen tries in total {{on the way to}} a 106–8 victory.|$|E
5|$|Brandon, however, {{remained}} at Bradford for the 2009–10 season and he scored his first goal {{for his hometown}} club with a late goal in a 2–0 victory against his former side Torquay United in late August. The following month, his second goal for the club again came against one of Brandon's former teams, as he once again <b>came</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> substitutes' bench to score in a 3–0 victory over Chesterfield. However, he continued to struggle to hold down a regular first-team place and when new manager Peter Taylor took over, Brandon {{was one of a}} number of players released early from his contract. He had played just 31 games during his two seasons with City, scoring three goals.|$|E

5|$|Entering the 2007 season, Sánchez {{was ranked}} {{as the second}} best {{prospect}} in the Giants' organization (behind only Tim Lincecum) by Baseball America. Sánchez made the Giants' roster out of spring training. He struggled in his first fourteen games, however, and was sent down to Fresno on May 21 when Russ Ortiz <b>came</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> disabled list. Sánchez returned to the majors on June 6 when, coincidentally, Ortiz got hurt again. On June 13, {{he picked up his}} first major league hit (an RBI double) in a 7–4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays. On July 4, he was placed on the disabled list with a strained rib cage, but he was reactivated on July 18.|$|E

Late in the season, he began producing The Dak and Dunc Show podcast with teammate Andrew Dakich for WCBN-FM Sports, which was available on iTunes.

5|$|From 1863, part of King's Cross was an {{intermediate}} station. On the extreme {{east of the}} site, King's Cross York Road station was served by suburban trains from Finsbury before they followed the sharply curved and steeply graded York Road Tunnel to join the City Widened Lines to Farringdon, Barbican and Moorgate. In the other direction, trains from Moorgate <b>came</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Widened Lines via the Hotel Curve, to platform 16 (latterly renumbered 14) which rose to the main line level. Services to and from Moorgate were diverted via the Northern City Line from November 1976. The station remained in occasional use until it was completely closed on 5 March 1977.|$|E
