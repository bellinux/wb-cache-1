40|$|Direct {{evidence}} for substantial mobilization of copper in the coronary flow immediately following prolonged, but not short, cardiac ischemia is presented. In the first coronary flow fraction (CFF) of reperfusion (0. 15 ml), after 35 min of ischemia, {{the level of}} copper (as well as of iron) was 8 - to 9 -fold higher than the preischemic value. The levels in subsequent CFFs decreased and reached the preischemic value, indicating that both metals appear in a burst at the resumption of coronary flow. When the first CFF was used in a reaction mixture containing ascorbate and salicylate, the latter underwent <b>chemical</b> <b>hydroxylation</b> and was converted to its dihydroxybenzoate derivatives. Likewise, this CFF promoted the ascorbate-driven DNA degradation. Subsequent 150 CFFs were serially collected and demonstrated low activities. Following 18 min of ischemia, the copper level in the first CFF of reperfusion was only 15 % over the preischemic value. In contrast, the mobilization of iron into coronary flow was significant but markedly lower than after 35 min. The levels of copper and the redox activity of the first CFF correlated well with the degree of loss of cardiac function, after 18 and 35 min of ischemia, respectively. After 18 min of ischemia, cardiac function was about 50 % and the damage is considered reversible, whereas after 35 min the functional loss exceeded 80 % and is considered irreversible. These results are {{in accord with the}} causative role that copper and iron can play in heart injury following ischemia, by virtue of their capacity to catalyze the production of hydroxyl radicals, and could lead to the development of new modalities for intervention in tissue injury...|$|E
40|$|Highly biologically active marine {{sesquiterpene}} ilimaquinone {{was selected}} for chemical modifications. Its biotransformation was investigated using a combinatorial approach as an original way to screen different strains of microorganisms. Mucor circinelloides ATCC 8541 was able to structurally modify ilimaquinone into three different compounds. A stereospecific epoxidation was observed and compared to <b>chemical</b> epoxidation. A <b>hydroxylation</b> of the decalin ring was also observed {{as well as an}} unexpected substitution on the quinone ring by ethanolamine. Compounds were evaluated against several cell lines.

40|$|Here, we {{show that}} the {{stoichiometry}} and, consequently, the <b>chemical</b> activity toward <b>hydroxylation</b> of MgO(100) films grown by reactive deposition on Ag(100) strongly depend on the O(2) partial pressure during film growth. Oxygen-deficient films undergo dramatic relative oxygen uptake either by exposure to a partial pressure of water vapor or by aging in vacuum for a sufficiently long time. Conversely, on stoichiometric monolayer MgO islands, photoemission analysis of the O Is level and scanning tunneling microscopy images {{are consistent with the}} prediction that dissociative adsorption of water occurs only at the borders of the islands...|$|R
50|$|This article covers protein {{engineering}} of cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzymes. P450s {{are involved in}} a range of biochemical catabolic and anabolic process. Natural P450s can perform several different types of <b>chemical</b> reactions including <b>hydroxylations,</b> N,O,S-dealkylations, epoxidations, sulfoxidations, aryl-aryl couplings, ring contractions and expansions, oxidative cyclizations, alcohol/aldehyde oxidations, desaturations, nitrogen oxidations, decarboxylations, nitrations, as well as oxidative and reductive dehalogenations. Engineering efforts often strive for 1) improved stability 2) improved activity 3) improved substrate scope 4) enabled ability to catalyze unnatural reactions.P450 engineering is an emerging field in the areas of chemical biology and synthetic organic chemistry (chemoenzymatic).|$|R
40|$|Small Au {{particles}} {{have been}} shown to exhibit interesting catalytic properties. In an attempt to parallel catalytic studies on powder supports we have undertaken a series of model studies using oxide films as support. We address the formation of Au aggregates as a function of size starting from Au atoms to clusters and islands of larger size and {{as a function of the}} support. In addition we have studied different support materials such as alumina and iron oxide and we compare ultrathin and thicker oxide films of the same material (MgO). From a comparison of charge transfer through ultrathin films with the situation encountered in thicker films, we propose the use of dopants in bulk materials to control particle shape. We include the study of carbon monoxide adsorption on Au clusters of varying size. It is demonstrated how <b>chemical</b> modification (<b>hydroxylation)</b> of oxide supports influence particle growth and properties. Finally, we report on effects to study the processes involved in particle growth by wet impregnation in order to bridge the gap to catalyst preparation under realistic conditions. On that basis one may now compare properties of supported particles prepared in ultrahigh vacuum using physical vapor deposition with those prepared by wet impregnation...|$|R
30|$|As a support, highly porous solids such as ceramic {{capillaries}} {{provide a}} {{large surface area}} in proportion to its volume. Using porous ceramics has several advantages compared to polymer membranes or particulate supports. They can be produced to have relatively high levels of mechanical strength, corrosion resistance and stability under high temperatures and pressures {{and they do not}} show any swelling behavior in liquid media. The pore diameter can be adapted to its purpose such as bacteria filtration (Kroll et al. 2010), oilâ€“water separation (Zhu et al. 2016) or gas-conversion (Xue et al. 2016). However, to combine reaction and separation within the same unit, modifications of the ceramic capillary surface are necessary. Common strategies for membrane activation include <b>chemical</b> treatments like <b>hydroxylation,</b> followed by silanization with 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) for linking the biocatalyst (Kroll et al. 2012). Since the enzymes are covalently bound to the amino group of the support, these reactors allow high recovery in enzyme activity. Most applications of immobilized enzymes in industry are based on a conversion of sugar (Jensen and Rugh 1987; Bhosale et al. 1996) or oil (Noureddini et al. 2005; Tan et al. 2010), but rarely protein.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Oxygenases {{catalyze}} the hydroxylation of a {{wide variety}} of organic substrates. An ability to alter oxygenase substrate specificities and improve their activities and stabilities using recombinant DNA techniques would expand their use in processes such as chemical synthesis and bioremediation. Discovery and directed evolution of oxygenases require efficient screens that are sensitive to the activities of interest and can be applied to large numbers of crude enzyme samples. Results: Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) couples the phenolic products of hydroxylation of aromatic substrates to generate colored and/or fluorescent compounds that are easily detected spectroscopically in high-throughput screening. Coexpression of the coupling enzyme with a functional mono- or dioxygenase creates a pathway for the conversion of aromatic substrates into fluorescent compounds in vivo. We used this approach for detecting the products of the toluene-dioxygenase-catalyzed hydroxylation of chlorobenzene and to screen large mutant libraries of Pseudomonas putida cytochrome P 450 cam by fluorescence digital imaging. Colors generated by the HRP coupling reaction are sensitive to the site of oxygenase-catalyzed hydroxylation, allowing the screen to be used to identify catalysts with new or altered regiospecificities. Conclusions: The coupled oxygenase-peroxidase reaction system is well suited for screening oxygenase libraries to identify mutants with desired features, including higher activity or stability and altered reaction specificity. This approach should also be useful for screening expressed DNA libraries and combinatorial <b>chemical</b> libraries for <b>hydroxylation</b> catalysts and for optimizing oxygenase reaction conditions...|$|R
