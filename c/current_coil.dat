2500|$|The {{electromechanical}} {{induction meter}} operates by counting the revolutions of a non-magnetic, but electrically conductive, metal disc {{which is made}} to rotate at a speed proportional to the power passing through the meter. [...] The number of revolutions is thus proportional to the energy usage. The voltage coil consumes a small and relatively constant amount of power, typically around 2 watts which is not registered on the meter. [...] The <b>current</b> <b>coil</b> similarly consumes {{a small amount of}} power in proportion to the square of the current flowing through it, typically up to a couple of watts at full load, which is registered on the meter.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{electromechanical}} {{instrument is}} the polarized-vane type. In this instrument a stationary field coil produces a rotating magnetic field, {{just like a}} polyphase motor. The field coils are connected either directly to polyphase voltage sources or to a phase-shifting reactor if a single-phase application. [...] A second stationary field coil, perpendicular to the voltage coils, carries a current proportional to current in one phase of the circuit. The moving system of the instrument consists of two vanes that are magnetized by the <b>current</b> <b>coil.</b> In operation the moving vanes take up a physical angle equivalent to the electrical angle between the voltage source and the current source.

5000|$|The eddy {{currents}} pass directly above the pole pieces of two [...] "current" [...] coils under the disc, each wound {{with a few}} turns of heavy-gauge wire whose inductive reactance is small compared to the load impedance. These coils connect the supply to the load, producing a magnetic field in phase with the load current. This field passes from the pole of one <b>current</b> <b>coil</b> up perpendicularly through the disc and back down through the disc to the pole of the other <b>current</b> <b>coil,</b> with a completed magnetic circuit {{back to the first}} <b>current</b> <b>coil.</b> As these fields cross the disc, they pass through the {{eddy currents}} induced in it by the voltage coil producing a Lorentz force on the disc mutually perpendicular to both. Assuming power is flowing to the load, the flux from the left <b>current</b> <b>coil</b> crosses the disc upwards where the eddy current flows radially {{toward the center of the}} disc producing (by the right hand rule) a torque driving the front of the disc to the right. Similarly, the flux crosses down through the disc to the right <b>current</b> <b>coil</b> where the eddy current flows radially away from the disc center, again producing a torque driving the front of the disc to the right. When the AC polarity reverses, the eddy currents in the disc and the direction of the magnetic flux from the current coils both change, leaving the direction of the torque unchanged.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{describe}} superconducting magnet coil arrangements from low to high field, particularly from 1 T to 7 T, within the context of the minimum stored energy designs. The findings illustrate that at low field, the maximum peak magnetic fields are located away from the most inner coils of the magnet configuration, whereas in high field designs, the maximum peak magnetic fields are created on coils lying on the inner diameter of the magnet bore. This becomes a critical aspect of any high field design, since there appears to be much less freedom of design at higher fields, due to the inherent limitations posed by peak magnetic fields on superconductors. Our findings also indicate that at low fields, 3 T and less, reverse <b>current</b> <b>coils</b> can be used to shorten superconducting magnets, whereas at high field, above 3 T, this is not necessarily the case, due to the large peak fields produced between adjacent, alternating <b>current</b> <b>coils...</b>|$|R
