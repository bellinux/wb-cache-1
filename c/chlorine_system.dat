40|$|The {{predominance}} area diagrams of electron activity (p epsilon) as {{a function}} of pH for <b>chlorine</b> <b>system</b> with multi-oxychlorine species have been constructed. On the base of the diagrams, electron activity and pH directly dominate the generation and stability of chlorine dioxide. Generation processes are in fact to shift the equilibria of <b>chlorine</b> <b>system</b> into the predominance area of chlorine dioxide, which correspond to the processes of acidification, oxidization and/or reduction. It is practically not achievable to generate pure chlorine dioxide from chlorate and chlorite. For different water environments, chlorine dioxide may be present a variation on stability owing to the changed p epsilon and pH values. If no disproportionation of chlorine dioxide into chlorate occurred in aqueous solution, chlorine dioxide would be relatively stable and coexist with chlorite (p epsilon 17. 63 and pH > 9. 68), molecular chlorine (pH < 0. 92), or chloride ion (pH 0. 92 similar to 9. 68). When <b>chlorine</b> <b>system</b> has already reached the ultimate equilibria, chlorine dioxide is a stable species only in strongly acid media. As the acidity decreases, chlorine dioxide disproportionates into chlorate and molecular chlorine. Aqueous chlorine dioxide is unstable within the normal pH range...|$|E

40|$|A new method, without {{assistance}} of activity ratio diagram, {{was applied to}} construct the pepsilon-pH diagrams for <b>chlorine</b> <b>system.</b> The optimal pH range for generation of ClO 2 by contacting Cl- 2 (g) directly with ClO 2 - solution is within pH 1. 35 - 1. 94, particularly within pH 1. 35 - 4. 00 only if minimizing the formation of Cl- 2. It is unachievable to synthesize pure ClO 2 from the reaction of Cl- 2 and ClO 2. Conversely, ClO 2 may be present a variation of stability indifferent waters owing to the changed pepsilon and pH. ClO 2 could be relatively stable if not disproportionate into ClO 3, coexisting with ClO 2 - (pepsilon 17. 63 and pH > 9. 68), Cl- (pH {{less than or equal}} to 0. 92) or Cl- (pH 0. 92 - 9. 68).

40|$|Iron oxides {{are common}} {{minerals}} {{that occur in}} the environment, either naturally or as a result of human activities. The most common Fe(III) -hydroxides and -oxides include ferrihydrite (Fe 5 HO 8. 4 H 2 O) that transforms to hematite (a-Fe 2 O 3) and/or goethite (a-FeOOH). That depends on the solution composition, temperature and pH. Depending on the composition of the solid and solution, oxidation can transform the green rust (a product formed by a metal corrosion) to lepidocrocite (γ -FeOOH) or magnetite (Fe(II) Fe(III) 2 O 4). Weathering can degrade magnetite to maghemite (γ –Fe 2 O 3) and all of the Fe-oxides are subject to an attack and dissolution by organic acids and ligands that are formed during the breakdown of biological material. Iron oxides can be prepared by hydrolysis of acidic Fe 3 + solutions or by controlled oxidation of Fe 2 + solutions. Goethite, lepidocrocite and magnetite were prepared by oxidation of Fe 2 + solutions under slightly different values of pH, Fe concentrations and rates of oxidation. Maghemite was prepared by a thermal transformation from synthetic lepidocrocite heated in a furnace at 250 °C for 2 h. Hematite was prepared by forced hydrolysis of Fe 3 + solution from a <b>chlorine</b> <b>system</b> (FeCl 3) at the temperature close to 100 °C under strongly acidic conditions (pH 1 - 2).

This project focuses on the pre-commissioning stages for the Timbers Edge Greywater Treatment System which was built in 2004, but never commissioned due to bankruptcy of the land developer. The system treats and recycles the residential greywater to irrigate the 1. 8 ha of public open spaces at Timbers Edge via subsurface dripline irrigation. The treatment system has the design capacity to treat 48 kL/day of greywater (excluding kitchen) from all residential homes in the Timbers Edge Residential Village. There are currently around 210 homes built, with a maximum of 260 lots.

Ground-truthing was completed to verify the design documentation with the in-situ installation and a number of needed repairs and rectifications were identified.
