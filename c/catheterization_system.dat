40|$|An {{ultrasonic}} {{method to}} determine bladder volumes could help eliminate {{some of the}} risk and discomfort resulting from <b>catheterizations.</b> A <b>system</b> using "A" mode ultra-sound correctly estimates bladder volumes to within 50 cc's. Near and far walls of bladder sections found at various positions define the bladder, and volumes calculated from these sections are added together for a bladder volume estimate. Accurate volume estimates (mean error of - 1. 9 cc. 's with standard deviation of 28 cc. 's) were obtained when bladder section characteristics such as: depth of the near wall of the bladder, thickness of the far wall echo, distance between near and far bladder walls, and amplitude of the far bladder wall echo, were considered. Most bladders were completely scanned with the transducer placed at the bodies midline, approximately 5 to 7. 5 cm. above the pubic bone...|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} a <b>catheterization</b> <b>system</b> that permits chronic {{infusion}} into the arterial supply of one hindlimb of rats to study the direct effects of rat growth hormone and human somatomedin C on growth of the tibial epiphyseal cartilage plate in hypophysectomized rats. Rat growth hormone (0. 4 microgram per day) or human somatomedin C (0. 25, 1, or 4 micrograms per day) stimulated growth of the epiphyseal plate of the infused limb but not of that of the contralateral noninfused limb. The somatomedin C had a dose-related effect. Rabbit antiserum to human somatomedin C, but not normal rabbit serum, completely abolished the direct growth effect of the rat growth hormone when it was co-infused with the hormone. These results support the concept that growth hormone stimulates long bone growth by inducing local production of somatomedin, which in turn stimulates cell proliferation in an autocrine or paracrine fashion. However, they do not exclude the possibility that serum somatomedin may also play a role...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{describe}} the design, the development and the first six years of application of a computer based cardiac <b>catheterization</b> <b>system</b> currently in daily use at the Thoraxcenter of the University Hospital in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Over {{the past three decades}} cardiac catheterization has become an increasingly sophisticated and complex procedure, which currently is considered as an indispensable step in the procedures leading to cardiac surgery. Given the need for accuracy, the need for automation has become evident. The steps along which this development took place, form the substance of the various chapters of this work. In chapter II the available literature has been reviewed and condensed in three parts: first, a selective description of the most relevant publications which existed prior to the design and development of the system; a second section in which all relevant previous publications from the Rotterdam group are enumerated but not further discussed, and a final listing of all the most important sources of reference that were utilized {{in one form or another}} in the entire text of this work. A detailed description of the system appeared in print in the peer-review literature in 1975. It forms the culmination of many years of work and details all the components in the design of hardware and software. Also it analyses the day-by-day operation of the entire system and provides some early insight in the experience accrued until 1975. In fact it can be considered as a sort of statement of our beliefs and is reprinted as chapter II...|$|E
40|$|Endovascular {{techniques}} have been embraced as a minimally-invasive treatment approach within different disciplines of interventional radiology and cardiology. The current practice of endovascular procedures, however, {{is limited by}} a number of factors including exposure to high doses of X-ray radiation, limited 3 D imaging, and lack of contact force sensing and haptic feedback from the endovascular tools and the vascular anatomy. More recently, development of robotic platforms have aimed to improve these practices by removing the operator from the radiation source and increasing the precision and stability of catheter motion with added degrees-of-freedom. Despite their increased application and a growing research interest in this area, many such systems have been designed without considering the natural manipulation skills and ergonomic preferences of the operators. Existing studies on tool interactions and behaviour patterns of operators have been very limited, and presently {{there is a lack of}} objective and quantitative metrics for performance and skill evaluation. This research proposes a framework for automated and objective assessment of endovascular skill, by measuring catheter-tissue contact forces and operator force/motion patterns across different skill levels, relating operator tool forces to catheter dynamics and forces exerted on the vasculature, and learning the underlying force and motion patterns that are characteristic of skill. Furthermore, a novel cooperative robotic <b>catheterization</b> <b>system</b> based on 'Learning-from-Demonstration' is developed, by utilizing a learning-based approach for generating optimum motion trajectories from multiple demonstrations of a catheterization task, as well as encoding the higher-level structure of a task as a sequence of primitive motions, to enable semi-autonomous catheter navigation within a collaborative setting. The results provide important insights into improving catheter navigation in the form of assistive or semi-autonomous robotics, and motivate the design of collaborative robots that are intuitive to use, while reducing the cognitive workload of the operator.

40|$|BackgroundEmerging robotic {{technologies}} {{are increasingly being}} used by surgical disciplines to facilitate and improve performance of minimally invasive surgery. Robot-assisted intervention has recently been introduced into the field of vascular surgery to potentially enhance laparoscopic vascular and endovascular capabilities. The objective {{of this study was}} to review the current status of clinical robotic applications in vascular surgery. MethodsA systematic literature search was performed in order to identify all published clinical studies related to robotic implementation in vascular intervention. Web-based search engines were searched using the keywords “surgical robotics,” “robotic surgery,” “robotics,” “computer assisted surgery,” and “vascular surgery” or “endovascular” for articles published between January 1990 and November 2009. An evaluation and critical overview of these studies is reported. In addition, an analysis and discussion of supporting evidence for robotic computer-enhanced telemanipulation systems in relation to their applications in laparoscopic vascular and endovascular surgery was undertaken. ResultsSeventeen articles reporting on clinical applications of robotics in laparoscopic vascular and endovascular surgery were detected. They were either case reports or retrospective patient series and prospective studies reporting laparoscopic vascular and endovascular treatments for patients using robotic technology. Minimal comparative clinical evidence to evaluate the advantages of robot-assisted vascular procedures was identified. Robot-assisted laparoscopic aortic procedures have been reported by several studies with satisfactory results. Furthermore, the use of robotic technology as a sole modality for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and expansion of its applications to splenic and renal artery aneurysm reconstruction have been described. Robotically steerable endovascular catheter systems have potential advantages over conventional <b>catheterization</b> <b>systems.</b> Promising results from applications in cardiac interventions and preclinical studies have urged their use in vascular surgery. Although successful applications in endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm and lower extremity arterial disease have been reported, published clinical experience with the endovascular robot is limited. ConclusionsRobotic technology may enhance vascular surgical techniques given preclinical evidence and early clinical reports. Further clinical studies are required to quantify its advantages over conventional treatments and define its role in vascular and endovascular surgery...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction Conversion of {{multiple}} hepatic arteries {{into a single}} vascular supply {{is a very important}} technique for repeat hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy using an implanted port catheter <b>system.</b> <b>Catheterization</b> of a replaced left hepatic artery arising from a left gastric artery using a percutaneous catheter technique is sometimes difficult, despite the recent development of advanced interventional techniques. Case presentation We present a case of a 70 -year-old Japanese man with multiple hepatocellular carcinomas in whom the replaced left hepatic artery arising from the left gastric artery needed to be embolized. After several failed procedures, the replaced left hepatic artery was successfully catheterized and embolized with a microcatheter and microcoils via the right gastric artery through the anastomosis. Conclusion A replaced left hepatic artery arising from a left gastric artery can be catheterized via a right gastric artery by using the appropriate microcatheter and microguidewires, and multiple hepatic arteries can be converted into a single supply. </p...|$|R

40|$|In a {{previous}} study (Hugenholtz, Lees, and Nadas, 1962) correlations between the resting hemodynamic state in congenital aortic stenosis (AS) and the cube vectorcardiogram showed great accuracy in predicting the presence of left ventricular hypertension. Results were better than those obtained by the standard electrocardiogram {{in a study of}} a larger group of similar patients (Braun-wald et al., 1963). Furthermore, alterations in the direction and magnitude of specific QRS vectors, as projected on the horizontal plane, correlated to some degree with left ventricular peak pressure and aortic gradient. However, the wide variation in these measurements often made proper assessment of the individual case impossible. Thus, while distinctly better than the standard electrocardiogram in the recognition of left ventricular hypertension, this type of uncorrected vectorcardiographic recording still proved to be inferior to the assessment of severity obtained by means of cardiac <b>catheterization.</b> The lead <b>system</b> proposed by Frank (1956) possesses characteristics which, on theoretical grounds, would make it a more desirable system for registration of the " equivalent dipole " (Langner et al., 1958).

40|$|Stroke and {{encephalopathy}} remain major {{causes of}} morbidity and occasional mortality complicating open heart surgery. Open heart surgery poses many hemo-dynamic, embolic, and metabolic {{threats to the}} brain, yet the cause of neurological damage often remains uncertain in the individual patient. Failure to recognize the multitude of potential causes for severe or subtle brain dysfunction after open heart surgery can lead to overemphasis of a few highly visible factors such as extracranial vascular disease. Cardiac <b>Catheterization</b> Central nervous <b>system</b> complications are rare dur-ing heart catheterization. In the course of over 30, 000 catheterizations done at our hospital during a five-year period, 35 patients sustained a focal deficit (carotid 15, vertebral-basilar 20), and two patients experienced dif-fuse encephalopathy. 1 In 19 patients the deficit re-solved, usually within 48 hours. In 18 patients the deficit persisted, and two patients {{died as a result}} of cerebral injury sustained during catheterization. The etiology was embolism or systemic hypotension in six patients; in two patients a vertebral artery was inadver-tently injected with contrast. No clear etiology was identified in the remaining patients, although many had a past history of stroke, documented cerebrovascu-lar disease, or potential cardiac embolic risk factors, such as ventricular hypokinesia, mural thrombus, or valvular disease...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the relation between}} left ventricular performance during exercise {{and the extent of}} coronary artery disease, the results of exercise radionuclide ventriculography were analyzed in 65 patients who also underwent cardiac <b>catheterization.</b> A scoring <b>system</b> was used to quantitate the extent of coronary artery disease. This system takes into account the number and site of stenoses of the major coronary vessels and their secondary branches. The conventional method of interpreting the coronary angiograms indicated that 26 patients had significant coronary artery disease (defined as 70 % or more narrowing of luminal diameter) of one vessel, 21 had multivessel disease and 18 had no significant coronary artery disease. Although the exercise left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly higher in patients with no coronary artery disease than in patients with one or multivessel disease (probability [p] < 0. 001), there was considerable overlap among the three groups. With the scoring system, a good correlation was found between the coronary artery disease score and the exercise left ventricular ejection fraction (r = - 0. 70; p < 0. 001). If the exercise heart rate was 130 beats/min or greater or the age of the patient was 50 years or less, an even better correlation was found (r = - 0. 73 and r = - 0. 82, respectively). The exercise ejection fraction (but not the change in ejection fraction, end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume from rest to exercise) correlated with the extent of coronary artery disease. The exercise ejection fraction is the most important exercise variable that correlates with the extent of coronary artery disease when the latter is assessed quantitatively by a scoring system rather than the conventional method of reporting coronary angiograms. Younger age and greater exercise heart rate strengthened the correlation. The change in ejection fraction from rest to exercise is useful in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, but it was the absolute level of exercise ejection fraction that predicted the extent of disease...|$|R
