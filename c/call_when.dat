5|$|The African river {{martin has}} a chee chee or cheer-cheer-cheer <b>call</b> <b>when</b> it is flying in flocks. It is very vocal during migration, giving harsh gull-like calls, {{and appears to}} have a {{jingling}} courtship song. No calls have been described for the white-eyed river martin.|$|E
5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} communicates by auditory {{and visual}} displays. The voice is generally noisy with several calls; loudest and most frequent is a wailing wy-lah, which is uttered by both sexes and often heard before the birds themselves are seen. There is usually an interval of 0.4 {{seconds before the}} call is repeated. This call is made by birds in flight, before taking off and returning to the nest. Carnaby's black cockatoos {{that are not in}} flight may answer with this <b>call</b> <b>when</b> they hear it. The call is often shortened or chopped off three-quarters of the way through as the bird takes off. The call varies between individual Carnaby's black cockatoos, and older nestlings can distinguish their parents' calls. Saunders labelled a variant of the wy-lah as the interrogative call—it is drawn out and ends with an inflection. Birds often utter a soft chuck <b>call</b> <b>when</b> alone. Females make a whistling call composed of two notes of varying volume when perched or about to take off. They also utter a softer version that is 0.6 seconds long, as well as a long single-noted whistle when alone. The male makes a soft shot wy-lah call in similar situations. Birds may also make a harsh screeching alarm <b>call</b> <b>when</b> they notice something is out of place. They squawk loudly in disputes with their own kind, when other animals enter breeding territory, or when they are handled by people in captivity. Males can utter a harsh chattering squeak when arguing with other males.|$|E
5|$|Males {{make two}} calls that are {{directed}} at females, sometimes {{as a prelude}} to mating. One is a sequence of short squeaks; the other is made up of consecutive ah notes with 0.1 second between each note. These calls can be brief or last up to several minutes. Nestlings make a noisy grating begging <b>call</b> <b>when</b> seeking or expecting food. An adult female may also make the call while incubating the eggs. Immature birds also make a grating call not associated with begging that parents ignore.|$|E

5|$|Pearl {{receives}} an emergency <b>call</b> <b>when</b> another super villain attacks. During the fight, Pearl sees Olivia {{caught in an}} explosion. Believing her friend dead, Pearl attacks the villain directly and suffers serious burns to her hands and face. She faints after she subdues him. She awakens in a hospital and finds herself healed except for her hair.|$|E
5|$|Red wattlebirds utter {{two types}} of alarm calls, {{alternating}} between them while mobbing other animals. One is a harsh call over a wide frequency (1.3 to 5.9kHz) that is louder at lower frequencies. The other a lower-pitched staccato call with a frequency of 1.1–2.2kHz. They give a harsh <b>call</b> <b>when</b> trying to distract intruders from {{the vicinity of the}} nest or when picked up, often trying to flap or peck the handler.|$|E
5|$|The usual call is {{an eerie}} high-pitched wailing contact call, kee-ow... kee-ow... kee-ow, made while flying or roosting, {{and can be}} heard from afar. Birds may also make a harsh {{screeching}} alarm call. They also make a soft, chuckling <b>call</b> <b>when</b> searching for cossid moth larvae. Adults are normally quiet when feeding, while juveniles make frequent noisy begging calls. The superb lyrebird can mimic the adult yellow-tailed black cockatoo's contact call with some success.|$|E

50|$|Pin is a {{platform}} for creating analysis tools. A pin tool comprises instrumentation, analysis and callback routines. Instrumentation routines are <b>called</b> <b>when</b> code {{that has not yet}} been recompiled is about to be run, and enable the insertion of analysis routines. Analysis routines are <b>called</b> <b>when</b> the code associated with them is run. Callback routines are only <b>called</b> <b>when</b> specific conditions are met, or when a certain event has occurred. Pin provides an extensive application programming interface (API) for instrumentation at different abstraction levels, from one instruction to an entire binary module. It also supports callbacks for many events such as library loads, system calls, signals/exceptions and thread creation events.|$|R

5|$|Victor also {{travels to}} Woodruff's apartment, {{intending}} to confront his former friend about the threatening phone <b>call.</b> <b>When</b> Woodruff sees Victor outside the apartment building, he feigns {{a cry for}} help and shoots Evans to death. Victor is blamed {{for the murder of}} the man presumed to be Woodruff, and is sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Like the sassabies, {{hartebeest}} produce quiet quacking and grunting sounds. Juveniles {{tend to be}} {{more vocal}} than adults, and produce a quacking <b>call</b> <b>when</b> alarmed or pursued. The hartebeest uses defecation as an olfactory and visual display. Herds are generally sedentary, and tend to migrate only under adverse conditions such as natural calamities. The hartebeest is the least migratory in the tribe Alcelaphini (which also includes wildebeest and sassabies), and also consumes the least amount of water and has the lowest metabolic rate among the members of the tribe.|$|E
5|$|The chicks hatch 12–14days after {{incubation}} begins. Like all passerines, {{the chicks}} are altricial; they are hatched naked, with reddish bodies, pale grey down, and closed eyes. The mother bird feeds her young regurgitated seeds and insects as they grow. The hatchlings develop quickly, opening their eyes after three days, and completing {{the growth of}} olive-brown juvenile plumage after 11–15days, at which time they begin to practice short flights close to the nest. For up to three weeks after fledging, they are still fed by the male, who locates them by listening for their fledging call. The chicks stop giving this <b>call</b> <b>when</b> they become entirely independent.|$|E

5|$|Turquoise parrots are {{encountered}} in pairs or small groups consisting {{of parents and}} several offspring, though they may congregate into larger flocks of up to 75 predominantly juvenile birds outside the breeding season. As the breeding season nears, pairs separate out from these flocks. Turquoise parrots roost together communally in autumn and winter. At night they roost among the foliage of trees such as gums or wattles, anywhere from 1 to 8m (3–25ft) above the ground. They retreat to trees near their feeding areas during the day. The calls of the turquoise parrot have been little-studied; birds give a high-pitched soft contact <b>call</b> <b>when</b> feeding or in flight, while the alarm call {{has been described as}} a high-pitched zitting call. Turquoise parrots also chatter when settling to roost in the evening.|$|E
5|$|For all {{the claims}} about the {{potential}} for violence, election day, November 7, remained mostly calm across the state. Fewer than a dozen people were arrested statewide. Voting returns were slow, and on election night, the race was still too close to <b>call.</b> <b>When</b> the official tally was announced, Taylor had won by a vote of 193,714 to 191,331. Former governor John Y. Brown, nominated by a dissident group of Democrats, had garnered 12,040 votes, and Populist candidate John G. Blair had captured 2,936. Though the Board of Elections was thought to be controlled by Goebel, it rendered a surprise 2–1 decision to certify the election results. The board's majority opinion claimed {{that they did not have}} any judicial power and were thus unable to hear proof or swear witnesses, leaving them without grounds to invalidate any votes. Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year he {{returned}} to the field, West worked in the ALDS. He also umpired in the 2003 and 2004 ALCS. In game six of the latter series, West's crew ruled Yankees batter Alex Rodriguez out for interference after Rodriguez appeared to swat the ball out of the glove of opposing pitcher Bronson Arroyo on his way to first base. Fans threw debris on the field, Red Sox manager Terry Francona pulled his team off the field, and NYPD officers in riot gear took to the field to calm the crowd. West said fans actually applauded the umpires for the correct <b>call</b> <b>when</b> they came onto the field the following day. West’s first All-Star Game and World Series appearances after his rehire came in 2005; that year he umpired in his second ALDS and his third World Series, serving as World Series crew chief.|$|E

5|$|On August 4, Governor General Manuel Macías y Casado sent Colonel Pedro del Pino {{and about}} 220 troops, {{including}} civil guardsmen {{to recapture the}} city. When Colonel Pino entered Fajardo on August 7, he found it nearly deserted because the residents, fearing a battle, had fled to the Fajardo Light and the surrounding hills. At close to midnight on August 8, Pino's troops began their assault on the lighthouse. The landing party of Amphitrite's sailors occupying the lighthouse doused the light and signaled the ships offshore, initiating shore bombardment as the naval guns began firing a protective pattern. After two hours, the Spanish forces retreated back to the town. The Americans suffered no casualties, despite a close <b>call</b> <b>when</b> a wayward naval shell smashed through the 2-foot thick walls of the lighthouse within touch of 6 men but failed to explode. The Spanish losses were 2 dead and 3 wounded, including a lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{are much}} more vocal, {{especially}} during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates. The presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself. In most species, the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs in the throat or {{at the corner of}} the mouth. This may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator, helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere, or the water at times when the animal is submerged. The main vocalisation is the male's loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory. This call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near. Calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy. Other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus. When a frog is attacked, a distress or fright call is emitted, often resembling a scream. The usually nocturnal Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) produces a rain <b>call</b> <b>when</b> there is rainfall during daylight hours.|$|E
25|$|Elephant seals {{communicate}} though various means. Males will threaten {{each other}} with the snort, a sound caused by expelling air though their probosces, and the clap-trap, a loud, clapping sound comparable {{to the sound of}} a diesel engine. Pups will vocalize when stressed or when prodding their mothers to allow them to suckle. Females make an unpulsed attraction <b>call</b> <b>when</b> responding to their young, and a harsh, pulsed <b>call</b> <b>when</b> threatened by other females, males or alien pups. Elephant seals produce low-frequency sounds, both substrate-borne and air-borne. These sounds help maintain social hierarchy in crowded or noisy environments and reduce energy consumption when fasting.|$|E

25|$|South American {{sea lions}} are {{observed}} to make various vocalizations and calls which differ between sexes and ages. Adult males make high-pitched calls during aggressive interactions, barks when establishing territories, growls when interacting with females, and exhalations after antagonistic encounters. Females with pups make a mother primary <b>call</b> <b>when</b> interacting with their pups, and grunts during aggressive encounters with other females. Pups make pup primary calls. Some of those vocalizations and acoustic features may support individuality.|$|E
25|$|With the {{introduction}} of microcomputers with expansion slots, like the S-100 bus machines and Apple II, it became possible for the modem to communicate instructions and data on separate lines. A number of modems of this sort were available by the late 1970s. This made the BBS possible for the first time, as it allowed software on the computer to pick up an incoming call, communicate with the user, and then hang up the <b>call</b> <b>when</b> the user logged off.|$|E
25|$|Under Objective-C, {{methods are}} {{represented}} by a selector, a string describing the method to <b>call.</b> <b>When</b> a message is sent, the selector is sent into the Objective-C runtime, matched against a list of available methods, and the method's implementation is called. Since the selector is text data, this lets it be saved to a file, transmitted over a network or between processes, or manipulated in other ways. The implementation of the method is looked up at runtime, not compile time. There is a small performance penalty for this, but late binding allows the same selector to reference different implementations.|$|E
