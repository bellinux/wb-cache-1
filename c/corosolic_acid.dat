40|$|Introduction – Very rarely {{fruit pulp}} {{has been used}} in in vitro culture to produce {{secondary}} metabolites useful in promoting health. Objectives – The aims of this work were the study of the best conditions to obtain the callus cultures from the pulp of two varieties of apples, Golden Delicious (GD) and “Mela Rosa Marchigiana” (MRM), and the quali-quantitative analysis of secondary metabolites produced by the two in vitro callus cultures. Methodology – Callus was induced on both Murashige and Skoog and Gamborg B 5 media containing various combinations of supplements. To achieve the maximum recovery of secondary metabolites produced, preliminary extraction tests were carried out on GD apple culture using two different organic solvents (MeOH and EtOAc). The quali-quantitative analysis of the methanolic extract of both cultures was carried out by ESI-MSn and GC–MS techniques. Results – The GC–MS analysis revealed the presence of triterpenic acids, in particular, oleanolic, ursolic, maslinic, pomolic, tormentic, <b>corosolic</b> and annurcoic <b>acid</b> along with a phytosterol, β-sitosterol. In addition, GD callus culture produced phloridzin, absent in the MRM culture. In this last culture, however, the total amount of secondary metabolites was markedly higher. The in vivo production of these bioactive compounds were also quantified in the GD and MRM apple pulps. Conclusion – Apple pulps produced higher amounts of triterpenic acids in vitro than in vivo.

40|$|Chemical {{investigation}} of the methanol extract of the leaves of Tectona grandis led to the isolation of one new anthraquinone derivative, grandiquinone A (3 -acetoxy- 8 -hydroxy- 2 -methylanthraquinone) (1), along with nine known compounds: 5, 8 -dihydroxy- 2 -methylanthraquinone (2), hydroxysesamone (3), 3 -hydroxy- 2 -methylanthraquinone (4), quinizarine (5), betulinic acid (6), ursolic acid (7), tectograndone (8), <b>corosolic</b> <b>acid</b> (9) and sitosterol 3 -O-β-d-glucopyranoside (10). Compounds 2 and 3 were isolated {{for the first time}} from the leaves of this plant, while 5 has never been reported from the genus Tectona. Hydroxysesamone (3) and tectograndone (8) were subjected to cyclisation and acetylation reactions to afford two hemisynthetic derivatives, 6, 9 -dihydroxy- 2, 2 -(dimethyldihydropyrano) - 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 H-benzo[g]chromene- 5, 10 -dione (11) and acetyltectograndone (12) respectively, which are reported here for the first time. The ethyl acetate-soluble portion, some of the isolated compounds and hemisynthetic derivatives were evaluated for their antiplasmodial activity against the multidrug-resistant Dd 2 strain of Plasmodium falciparum. Compound 3 showed a prominent activity, while 2, 8, 9, 11 and 12 showed significant in vitro anti-malarial activity. Compound 1 was weakly active in this test. The structures of the compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic methods and comparison of the data with the literature. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibition}} of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11 beta-HSD 1), which catalyzes {{the conversion of}} inactive 11 -ketoglucocorticoids to active 11 beta-hydroxyglucocorticoids, emerged as promising strategy to treat symptoms of the metabolic syndrome, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. In this study {{the leaves of the}} anti-diabetic medicinal plant loquat (Eriobotrya japonica) were phytochemically investigated following hints from a pharmacophore-based virtual screening and a bioactivity-guided approach. Determination of the 11 beta-HSD 1 and 11 beta-HSD 2 inhibitory activities in cell lysates revealed triterpenes from the ursane type as selective, low micro-molar inhibitors of 11 beta-HSD 1, that is, <b>corosolic</b> <b>acid</b> (1), 3 -epicorosolic acid methyl ester (4), 2 -alpha hydroxy- 3 -oxo urs- 12 -en- 28 -oic acid (6), tormentic acid methyl ester (8), and ursolic acid (9). Importantly, a mixture of loquat constituents with moderate activities displayed a pronounced additive effect. By means of molecular modeling studies and the identification of the 11 beta-HSD 1 -inhibiting 11 -keto-ursolic acid (17) and 3 -acetyl- 11 -keto-ursolic acid (18) a structure-activity relationship was deduced for this group of pentacyclic triterpenes. The mechanism of action elucidated in the present work together with the previously determined pharmacological activities provides these natural products with an astonishing multi-targeted anti-diabetic profile...|$|E
40|$|The {{leaves of}} Lagerstroemia speciosa (Lythraceae), a Southeast Asian tree more {{commonly}} known as banaba, have been traditionally consumed in various forms by Philippinos for treatment of diabetes and kidney related diseases. In the 1990 s, the popularity of this herbal medicine began {{to attract the attention}} of scientists worldwide. Since then, researchers have conducted numerous in vitro and in vivo studies that consistently confirmed the antidiabetic activity of banaba. Scientists have identified different components of banaba to be responsible for its activity. Using tumor cells as a cell model, <b>corosolic</b> <b>acid</b> was isolated from the methanol extract of banaba and shown to be an active compound. More recently, a different cell model and the focus on the water soluble fraction of the extract led to the discovery of other compounds. The ellagitannin Lagerstroemin was identified as an effective component of the banaba extract responsible for the activity. In a different approach, using 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes as a cell model and a glucose uptake assay as the functional screening method, Chen et al. showed that the banaba water extract exhibited an insulin-like glucose transport inducing activity. Coupling HPLC fractionation with a glucose uptake assay, gallotannins were identified in the banaba extract as components responsible for the activity, not corosoli...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{efforts in}} recent years, {{infectious}} diseases remain a worldwide major public health problem. Several infectious agents have become resistant to conventional antibiotics {{and there is}} thus urgent need to discover new antimicrobial drugs to overcome resistances. Platostoma rotundifolium (Briq.) A. J. Paton, an African plant, is mainly used to treat microbial infections in traditional Burundian medicine. From the ethyl acetate extract of the aerial parts, five pentacyclic triterpenoid acids were isolated and characterized. Based on spectral analysis, these compounds were elucidated to be 2 α, 3 α, 19 β-trihydroxyurs- 12 -en- 28 -oic acid (that was named jeremic acid) (1), 3 β-hydroxyurs- 12 -en- 28 -oic acid (ursolic acid) (2), 2 α, 3 β-dihydroxyurs- 12 -en- 28 -oic acid (<b>corosolic</b> <b>acid)</b> (3), 2 α, 3 β, 19 α-trihydroxyurs- 2 -en- 28 -oic acid (tormentic acid) (4) and 19 -hydroxy- 2 -hydroxymethyl norursa- 2, 12 -dien- 28 -oic acid (hyptadienic acid) (5). Ursolic (MIC = 17. 5 - 68 μM) and corosolic (MIC = 17 - 68 μM) acids showed significant antibacterial activities against both the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains) and the Gram-negative Escherichia coli, which may substantiate the use of P. rotundifolium in traditional Burundian medicine. Such hydroxylated pentacyclic triterpenoid acids could point to new antimicrobial strategies that may help overcoming the antimicrobial resistances actually observed throughout the world.

There are many types of nontumor cells, including leukocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, in the tumor microenvironment. Among these cells, infiltrating macrophages have recently received attention as novel target cells due to their protumoral functions. Infiltrating macrophages are called tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs polarized to the M 2 phenotype are involved in tumor development and {{are associated with a}} poor clinical prognosis. Therefore, the regulation of TAM activation or M 2 polarization is a new strategy for antitumor therapy. We screened natural compounds possessing an inhibitory effect on the M 2 polarization of human macrophages. Among 200 purified natural compounds examined, <b>corosolic</b> <b>acid</b> (CA) and oleanolic acid (OA), both are categorized in triterpenoid compounds, inhibitedmacrophage polarization toM 2 phenotype by suppressing STAT 3 activation. CA and OA also directly inhibited tumor cell proliferation and sensitized tumor cells to anticancer drugs, such as adriamycin and cisplatin. The in vivo experiments showed that CA significantly suppressed subcutaneous tumor development and lung metastasis in a murine sarcoma model. The application of triterpenoid compounds, such as CA and OA, is a potential new anticancer therapy targeting macrophage activation, with synergistic effects with anticancer agents. 1...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether <b>corosolic</b> <b>acid</b> (CA) targeting nuclear protein expression of Nrf 2 activation {{can be used}} to attenuate renal damage and preserve renal function in alloxan diabetic mice. Methods: A mouse model with diabetic nephropathy was established to examine the Nrf 2 expression. Mice were randomly divided into control, diabetic control, and CA groups treated at 0. 4  mg/kg, 2  mg/kg and 10  mg/kg p. o. for 8 weeks. Diabetes was induced in mice by single intraperitoneal injection of alloxan 200  mg/kg in all groups except the control. The mice with fasting blood glucose level over 200  mg/dL were considered as diabetic and were employed in the study. After 4 th and 8 th weeks, urine samples were collected (using metabolic cages) to measure protein and urea. Animals were euthanized, and serum samples were collected to estimate the glucose, creatinine, total protein, urea and blood urea nitrogen. Kidney was isolated at the end of experiment for histology to evaluate anti-oxidant parameters. Immunohistochemistry was performed to examine the Nrf 2 expression. Results: CA treatment showed dose dependent reduction in level of biochemical parameters in serum and urine. CA group (10  mg/kg) showed significantly higher body weight and reduced kidney weight. Histopathological examination revealed reduced inflammation, collagen deposition and glomerulosclerosis in renal tissue. CA attenuated renal dysfunction, oxidative stress and inflammatory pro-cytokine levels. Conclusions: CA treatment exhibited ameliorative effect on kidney in mice with its enhanced Nrf 2 expression...|$|E
40|$|Pentacyclic Triterpenoids (PTs) {{and their}} analogues {{as well as}} {{derivatives}} are emerging as important drug leads for various diseases. They act {{through a variety of}} mechanisms and a majority of them inhibit the nuclear factor kappa-beta (NF-κB) signaling pathway. In this study, we examined the effects of the naturally occurring PTs on IκB kinase-β (IKKβ), which has great scientific relevance in the NF-κB signaling pathway. On virtual screening, 109 PTs were screened through the PASS (prediction of activity spectra of substances) software for prediction of NF-κB inhibitory activity followed by docking on the NEMO/IKKβ association complex (PDB: 3 BRV) and testing for compliance with the softened Lipinski's Rule of Five using Schrodinger (LLC, New York, USA). Out of the projected 45 druggable PTs, <b>Corosolic</b> <b>Acid</b> (CA), Asiatic Acid (AA) and Ursolic Acid (UA) were assayed for IKKβ kinase activity in the cell free medium. The UA exhibited a potent IKKβ inhibitory effect on the hotspot kinase assay with IC 50 of 69 μM. Whereas, CA at 50 μM concentration markedly reduced the NF-κB luciferase activity and phospho-IKKβ protein expressions. The PTs tested, attenuated the expression of the NF-κB cascade proteins in the LPS-stimulated RAW 264. 7 cells, prevented the phosphorylation of the IKKα/β and blocked the activation of the Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). The results suggest that the IKKβ inhibition is the major mechanism of the PTs-induced NF-κB inhibition. PASS predictions along with in-silico docking against the NEMO/IKKβ can be successfully applied in the selection of the prospective NF-κB inhibitory downregulators of IKKβ phosphorylation...|$|E
