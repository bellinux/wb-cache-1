There was also a big censorship flap going on at the time. We looked at it as a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> up with our obscenity quota.|$|E

25|$|By that time, Jayakatwang, the Adipati (Duke) of Kediri, a {{vassal state}} of Singhasari, had usurped and killed Kertanagara. After being pardoned by Jayakatwang {{with the aid}} of Madura's regent, Arya Wiraraja; Raden Wijaya, Kertanegara's son-in-law, was given the land of Tarik timberland. He then opened the vast timberland and built a new {{settlement}} there. The village was named Majapahit, which was taken from the name of a fruit that had a bitter taste (maja is the fruit name and pahit means bitter). When the Mongolian Yuan army sent by Kublai Khan arrived, Wijaya allied himself with the army to fight against Jayakatwang. Once Jayakatwang was destroyed, Raden Wijaya forced his allies to withdraw from Java by launching a surprise attack. Yuan's army had to withdraw in confusion as they were in hostile territory. It was also their last <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> the monsoon winds home; otherwise, {{they would have had to}} wait for another six months.|$|E

25|$|August began explosively for D.C. United, with United {{defeating}} visitors Real Salt Lake {{in a wild}} 6–4 {{shooting gallery}} of a game. As they did the previous weekend at home, United surrendered an extremely early goal, {{this time in the}} second minute. Once again, United also soon gave up another goal, falling behind 2–0 before rallying to victory. Rolfe scored unassisted from about 7 yards before halftime. Chris Rolfe tied the score in the second half, on a penalty kick that set off an incredible spree of goals. Five minutes after Rolfe's penalty kick evened the score, Taylor Kemp put the home team in front with a prodigious one-time strike on a loose ball from about 25 yards. The visitors evened the score only 3 minutes later with a header for goal on a free kick taken by Javier Morales. The tie score lasted about a minute, as Fabian Espindola was credited with a goal as he stretched to try and connect with a loose rebound, following a shot by Alvaro Saborio. RSL defender Justen Glad attempted to clear the loose ball off the line, but his attempted clearance hit Espindola's outstretched leg and the ball crossed the line before the defense could react. Once again, United failed to protect the lead, as RSL's Morales again picked apart the defense and earned his second assist within 6 minutes. This time, the tie score lasted for 11 minutes as Kemp served in a cross after a short corner kick, with Perry Kitchen getting {{on the end of the}} cross, heading it for the game-winning goal, in the 79th minute. Six minutes later, Nick DeLeon knifed through the RSL defense and blasted a long-range shot for an unassisted goal, capping off the 6-4 win. The six goals scored by United were the most the team had scored since a game in 2004, tying the team's all-time record mark. The combined 10 goals were also the most in any MLS game since 2004, a total that had been exceeded only once in league history. The win put D.C. United back on top of the Supporters Shield standings. Several teams held games in hand and the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> United in that race, but only FC Dallas had earned more points per game played.|$|E

"While it's easy to {{complain}} about a stretch of so-so movies," [...] wrote Matt Patches at Hollywood.com as 2012 began, [...] "the twist is we should really be thanking the studios for catering to niche audiences all month." [...] For most viewers, it is a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> up on the major awards contenders released in December. But studios and the filmgoers who have already seen those two films can benefit from creative risk-taking by filmmakers. He points to Cloverfield as one such gamble that succeeded.

500|$|... "A New Day in the Old Town" [...] was co-written by {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman and co-creator J.J. Abrams, with Goldsman also {{serving as}} director. In the DVD special features, actor Joshua Jackson explained {{the second season}} begins {{less than a day}} after the previous season's finale, [...] "so the characters have only just barely had a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> their breath from all the madness in the first season, and launch right back into the second one". Co-executive producer Jeff Pinkner considered beginning the second season directly after first season's final scene between Olivia and William Bell, but changed his mind because {{he thought it would be}} more interesting to show how Olivia's disappearance and reappearance affected the Fringe team, as well as the rest of the season. The scene between Olivia and Bell is consequently not shown until the season's fourth episode, [...] "Momentum Deferred". The premiere began the [...] "gun arc" [...] storyline, which commenced with Olivia hurtling out of her SUV and becoming too weak to control her gun during her physical recovery, and ended with the killing of the shapeshifter posing as Charlie Francis in [...] "Momentum Deferred".|$|E

500|$|Square began {{planning}} Chrono Cross {{immediately after}} the release of Xenogears in 1998 (which itself was originally conceived as a sequel to the SNES game). Chrono Triggers scenario director Masato Kato had brainstormed ideas for a sequel as early as 1996, following the release of [...] Square's managers selected a team, appointed Hiromichi Tanaka producer, and asked Kato to direct and develop a new Chrono game in the spirit of Radical Dreamers. Kato thought Dreamers was released in a [...] "half-finished state", and wanted to continue the story of the character Kid. Kato and Tanaka decided to produce an indirect sequel. They acknowledged that Square would soon re-release Chrono Trigger as part of Final Fantasy Chronicles, which would give players a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> up on the story of Trigger before playing Cross. Kato thought that using a different setting and cast for Chrono Cross would allow players unfamiliar with Chrono Trigger to play Cross without becoming confused. The Chrono Cross team decided against integrating heavy use of time travel into the game, as they thought it would be [...] "rehashing and cranking up the volume of the last game". Masato Kato cited the belief, [...] "there's no use in making something similar to before [...] ", and noted, [...] "we're not so weak nor cheap as to try to make something exactly the same as Trigger... Accordingly, Chrono Cross is not Chrono Trigger 2. It doesn't simply follow on from Trigger, but is another, different Chrono that interlaces with Trigger."

500|$|The {{tour was}} met with high praise from critics. Ashley Zimmerman from the New Times Broward-Palm Beach called the opening night of the tour [...] "memorable", {{describing}} the set by Thirty Seconds to Mars as [...] "a bit like a party", during which lead vocalist Jared Leto provided [...] "raw and beautiful vocals". She further wrote that co-headliner Linkin Park played a [...] "great mix {{of old and new}} songs" [...] that was able to please those who brought the band to fame, while still showcasing the newest work. Jay Cridlin of the Tampa Bay Times commented that the two bands made Steinbrenner Field's return to concert a [...] "smashing spectacle" [...] creating a [...] "powerful, festival-like feeling". He felt that Thirty Seconds to Mars delivered a [...] "fully committed performance", praising the band's energy on stage, and noticed the [...] "futuristic" [...] production of the show by Linkin Park. Alison Angel, writing for Creative Loafing Charlotte, opined that the tour offered fans a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> [...] "three big rock bands" [...] on a single event and felt that each performance was a [...] "sight to behold". She further said, [...] "between AFI tearing up the stage before the headliners even appeared, to the theatrics in Thirty Seconds to Mars' act and the grand performance of hard-rocking Linkin Park, fans walked out with a sense that this moment was truly once in a lifetime." [...] Danny Crandall of The Sun Chronicle commented that Linkin Park [...] "blitzed through an intense, head-bobbing" [...] set, while Thirty Seconds to Mars played a [...] "rousing performance" [...] high on audience interaction.|$|E
500|$|Entering {{the decisive}} {{part of the}} season, and still present in all competitions, Benfica's first game of February was a visit to Estádio Dr. Magalhães Pessoa to face União de Leiria. The home side startled Benfica, beating them 3–1. The loss, which Koeman called a small setback, granted Sporting the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> Benfica in second place. On 8 February, Benfica met Nacional at home for the sixth round of the Portuguese Cup; the match ended in a goalless draw, even after extra time. Benfica won the match after a penalty shoot-out. Four days later, Benfica {{returned}} to the winning path in the Primeira Liga after beating Penafiel 4–0. Geovanni opened the scoring in the first half, after which Nuno Gomes, Simão and an own goal from Roberto set the final result. On 18 February, Benfica played on the road against Vitória de Guimarães. They did not play as expected and conceded two goals—one in each half—losing 2–0. The loss severely hampered their title defence after being overtaken by Sporting and Braga and allowing leaders Porto—their next league opponent—to gain an eight-point advantage. Three days after Guimarães, Benfica hosted Liverpool for {{the first leg of}} the Champions League round of 16. According to Adrian Harte, the match was [...] "largely disappointing", but Benfica secured a vital win against Liverpool when Luisão scored with an 84th-minute header. The final match of February was a home to Porto, the second Clássico of the season. The high-tension match was decided with a [...] free kick from Laurent Robert that Vítor Baía could not stop. The win relaunched Benfica's title race and Porto's lead was reduced to five points. It {{was the first time in}} 29 years since 1976–77 Benfica had beaten Porto twice in the league and was also their first home win over Porto since 2000–01.|$|E

Iowa State's <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> up <b>to</b> Nebraska in the series were beginning to look bleak, as the Cornhuskers held a dominant lead at 11-3-1.|$|R

50|$|The raids {{had several}} objectives. One was to lay mines to sink passing British ships. Another was to pick off any small ships {{encountered}} or to entice larger groups into giving chase and lead {{them back to}} where the German High Seas Fleet would be waiting in ambush, in relatively safe waters near Germany. A further consideration was that raiding British coastal towns might force the British to alter the disposition of its ships to protect them. The British kept {{the greater part of}} the Grand Fleet together, so it would always have superiority whenever it engaged the Germans. The German navy hoped to encourage the British to split more ships from the main fleet for coastal defence, giving Germany more <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> isolated ships.|$|R

50|$|Flathead are {{notable for}} their unusual body shape, upon which their hunting {{strategy}} is based. Flathead are dorsally compressed, meaning their body is wide but flattened and {{very low in}} height. Both eyes are {{on the top of}} the flattened head, giving excellent binocular vision to attack overhead prey. The effect is somewhat similar to flounders. In contrast to flounder, however, flathead are much more elongated, the tail remains vertical, and the mouth is large, wide and symmetrical. Flathead use this body structure to hide in sand (their body colour changes to match their background), with only their eyes visible, and explode upwards and outwards to engulf small fish and prawns as they drift over, using a combination of ram and suction feeding thereby improving their <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> prey.|$|R
