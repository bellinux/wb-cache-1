40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of e-learning. We have compared three populations of student who prepare a French diploma called “Diplôme d’Accès aux Etudes Universitaires” which will allow them to follow courses at the university. Three modalities of courses are offered to prepare this diploma: an online or an evening-class or a <b>correspondence</b> <b>courses.</b> The results from this research indicate that drop is a key factor in estimating the internal efficiency. The chances of successful of online <b>courses</b> <b>student</b> are lower more than twice compared to <b>correspondence</b> <b>courses</b> <b>student.</b> Thus, with this mode of instruction for this audience in particular and this diploma, the chances of success are lower. However, if we do not take into account drop, the online education is as effective as <b>correspondence</b> <b>courses</b> or “face-to-face” courses...|$|R

50|$|Distance {{education}} or distance learning is {{the education of}} students who {{may not always be}} physically present at a school. Traditionally this usually involved <b>correspondence</b> <b>courses</b> wherein the <b>student</b> corresponded with the school via post. Today it involves online education. Courses that are conducted (51 percent or more) are either hybrid, blended or 100% whole instruction. Massive open online courses (MOOCs), offering large-scale interactive participation and open access through the World Wide Web or other network technologies, are recent developments in distance education. A number of other terms (distributed learning, e-learning, online learning, etc.) are used roughly synonymously with distance education.|$|R

40|$|Distance {{education}} is an aphorism that is gaining {{a great deal}} of attention on university campuses across the United States as well as worldwide. Despite this attention, the earliest record of distance education traces back to Biblical times, and was later referred to as correspondence. Land‐grant institutions were among the first to offer <b>correspondence</b> <b>courses</b> to <b>students</b> who may otherwise not be able to attend traditional university classes. While distance education programs and courses across the United States have grown, from 1. 6 million students enrolled to 3. 94 million students in two years, with only 4. 5 % of those offered in the discipline of natural resources. Identification of inhibitors and motivators for engagement in distance education opportunities with regards to university administrators, faculty, and students in the field of natural resources is the next step to understanding why the discipline is so poorly represented. Three surveys will be conducted in cooperation with 50 institutions, named by the Society of American Foresters (SAF) Accredited and Candidate Forestry Degree Programs listing to identify inhibitors and motivators, real and perceived, of university administrators, faculty, and students on their engagement in distance education activities. SAF is the accrediting body for the field of forestry and recognized these institutions as having met the criteria for a professional degree in forestry. Student populations from these institutions will consist of primarily traditional college undergraduate as well as graduate students enrolled in natural resource degree programs. Information obtained from all three surveys will provide insights into what administrators, faculty, and student needs might be in the future relative to distance education...|$|R
