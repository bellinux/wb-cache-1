50|$|They grow {{quickly into}} dandelion-like rosettes of edible, cress-like foliage. Barbarea verna, {{also known as}} upland <b>cress,</b> early <b>winter</b> <b>cress,</b> American cress, Belle Isle cress and scurvy grass, is used in salads or to add a nippy taste to mixed greens for cooking.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Salix, Populus and {{sometimes}} Betula species. Adults feed on nectar from flowers of blueberry, wild strawberry, blackberry, Labrador tea, dogbane, New Jersey tea, <b>winter</b> <b>cress,</b> purple vetch and lupine.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed {{on various}} grasses, {{including}} Schizachyrium scoparium and Andropogon gerardi. Adults feed on flower nectar from various low-growing plants, including Labrador tea, wild strawberry, blackberry, bird's-foot violet, <b>winter</b> <b>cress,</b> red clover, lilac, vervain, Carolina larkspur and wild hyacinth.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed {{on young}} leaves {{of red and}} white oaks, {{including}} Quercus phellos, Quercus velutina, Quercus ilicifolia, Quercus nigra, Quercus stellata, and Quercus virginiana. Adults feed on various flowers of plants up to about 4.5 feet tall, including dogbane, buttonbush, sneezeweed, goldenrod, peppermint, boneset, and <b>winter</b> <b>cress.</b>|$|R
50|$|Adults find nectar from a {{great variety}} of flowers {{including}} dogbane, swamp milkweed, shepherd's needle, asters, and <b>winter</b> <b>cress.</b> Males patrol open areas for females. The eggs are laid in small batches on the underside of host plant leaves. Caterpillars eat the leaves and are gregarious when young. Hibernation is by third-stage caterpillars.|$|R
50|$|Barbarea (<b>winter</b> <b>cress</b> {{or yellow}} rocket) is a genus of about 22 species of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} family Brassicaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with the highest species diversity in southern Europe and southwest Asia. They are small herbaceous biennial or perennial plants with dark green, deeply lobed leaves and yellow flowers with four petals.|$|R
40|$|<b>Winter</b> <b>cress</b> (Barbarea verna) seed {{preparations}} rich in phen-ethylisothiocyanate (PEITC) {{had strong}} in vivo and in vitro anti-inflammatory activity, significantly reducing {{the size of}} carrageenan-induced rat paw edema. This in vivo effect was comparable {{with that of the}} nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug aspirin. The seed preparation, in a concentration-depen-dent manner, reduced the mRNA levels of inflammation-related genes such as the inducible forms of cyclooxygenase and nitric-oxide synthase and the proinflammatory cytokine inter-leukin in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264. 7. Activity of the seed preparation was {{similar to that of the}} synthetic PEITC. PEITC was the most active of five different forms of isothiocyanate tested for their effects on in vitro proinflammatory gene expression. In vitro activity of the seed preparation was also compared with that of two known anti-inflammatory drugs. We conclude that Barbarea verna seed preparation may function as a potent anti-inflammatory agent, interfering with the transcription of proinflammatory genes. Phenethylisothiocyanate (PEITC) is an organosulfur bio-active compound present in many plants of the Brassicaceae family, most of which have long histories of human consump-tion. Of these, Barbarea verna (<b>winter</b> <b>cress)</b> is the richest source of PEITC (Ribnicky et al., 2001), with the highest levels formed in the seeds. <b>Winter</b> <b>cress</b> is an annual herb, mostly harvested as a seedling to add a peppery flavor to salads, sandwiches, soups, and garnishes. PEITC has many well documented cancer chemopreventive properties. In ad-dition, other related health-promoting effects in context of its anticarcinogenic activities, including anti-inflammatory...|$|R

50|$|There {{are also}} many wild edible plant stems. In North America, {{these include the}} shoots of common milkweed, Solomon's seal, wood sorrel (usually eaten with the leaves), {{blackberry}} and raspberry (peeled), chickweeds, galinsoga, common purslane, Japanese knotweed, saxifrage, cleavers, wild leeks, wild onion, nodding onion, field garlic, wild garlic, <b>winter</b> <b>cress</b> and other wild mustards, thistles (de-thorned), stinging nettles and wood nettles (cooked), burdock, bellworts, jewelweed, spiderwort, violets, carrion flower, twisted-stalk, amaranth, pine and slippery elm, among many others. Also, some wild plants with edible rhizomes (underground, horizontal stems) can be found, such as cattail, ground nut, Solomon's seal and false Solomon's seal. Wild edible tubers include arrowhead, and many more. Wild edible stems, like their domestic relatives, are usually only good when young and growing. Many of these also require preparation (as do many domestic plants, such as the potato), so {{it is wise to}} read up on the plant before experimenting with eating it.|$|R

40|$|<b>Winter</b> <b>cress</b> (Barbarea vulgaris) is {{resistant}} {{to a range}} of insect species. Some B. vulgaris genotypes are resistant, whereas others are susceptible, to herbivory by flea beetle larvae (Phyllotreta nemorum). Metabolites involved in resistance to herbivory by flea beetles were identified using an ecometabolomic approach. An F 2 population representing the whole range from full susceptibility to full resistance to flea beetle larvae was generated by a cross between a susceptible and a resistant B. vulgaris plant. This F 2 offspring was evaluated with a bioassay measuring the ability of susceptible flea beetle larvae to survive on each plant. Metabolites that correlated negatively with larvae survival were identified through correlation, cluster, and principal component analyses. Two main clusters of metabolites that correlate negatively with larvae survival were identified. Principal component analysis grouped resistant and susceptible plants as well as correlated metabolites. Known saponins, such as hederagenin cellobioside and oleanolic acid cellobioside, as well as two other saponins correlated significantly with plant resistance. This study shows the potential of metabolomics to identify bioactive compounds involved in plant defense...|$|R

40|$|Recently {{the number}} of studies {{investigating}} triterpenoid saponins has drastically increased due to their diverse and potentially attractive biological activities. Currently the literature contains chemical structures of few hundreds of triterpenoid saponins {{of plant and animal}} origin. Triterpenoid saponins consist of a triterpene aglycone with one or more sugar moieties attached to it. However, due to similar physico-chemical properties, isolation and identification of a large diversity of triterpenoid saponins remain challenging. This study demonstrates a methodology to screen saponins using hyphenated analytical platforms, GC-MS, LC-MS/MS, and LC-SPE-NMR/MS, in the example of two different phenotypes of the model plant Barbarea vulgaris (<b>winter</b> <b>cress),</b> glabrous (G) and pubescent (P) type that are known to differ by their insect resistance. The proposed methodology allows for detailed comparison of saponin profiles from intact plant extracts as well as saponin aglycone profiles from hydrolysed samples. Continuously measured 1 D proton NMR data during LC separation along with mass spectrometry data revealed significant differences, including contents of saponins, types of aglycones and numbers of sugar moieties attached to the aglycone. A total of 49 peaks were tentatively identified as saponins from both plants; they are derived from eight types of aglycones and with 2 – 5 sugar moieties. Identification of two previously known insect-deterrent saponins, hederagenin cellobioside and oleanolic acid cellobioside, demonstrated the applicability of the methodology for relatively rapid screening of bioactive compounds...|$|R
