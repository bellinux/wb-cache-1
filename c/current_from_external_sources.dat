50|$|The Peltier {{effect is}} the {{presence}} of heating or cooling at an electrified junction of two different conductors (1834). His great experimental discovery was the heating or cooling of the junctions in a heterogeneous circuit of metals according to the direction in which an electric current is made to pass round the circuit. This reversible effect is proportional directly to the strength of the current, not to its square, as is the irreversible generation of heat due to resistance {{in all parts of the}} circuit. It is found that, if a <b>current</b> pass <b>from</b> an <b>external</b> <b>source</b> through a circuit of two metals, it cools one junction and heats the other. It cools the junction if it be in the same direction as the thermoelectric current which would be caused by directly heating that junction. In other words, the passage of a <b>current</b> <b>from</b> an <b>external</b> <b>source</b> produces in the junctions of the circuit a distribution of temperature which leads to the weakening of the current by the superposition of a thermo-electric current running in the opposite direction.|$|R

40|$|Duration and {{amplitude}} of normal and prolonged action potentials from single nodes of Ranvier vary as functions of potential changes induced by <b>currents</b> <b>from</b> an <b>external</b> <b>source.</b> The quantitative relations between externally applied potential {{and the resulting}} potential generated within the system are analyzed {{in order to obtain}} information about the kinetics of the electromotance, [...] potential, [...] and chemical changes taking place during excitation. The following preliminary conclusions are drawn: A depolarizing and a repolarizing process (positive and negative electromotance) increase and decrease with the potential. For a sudden potential displacement the negative electromotance reaches its new value at a faster rate than the positive electromotance. Since the individual values of the two electromotances depend on the potential and since they both generate a potential which is proportional to the difference of their absolute values, the values of either electromotance are determined by this difference as well as by any externally induced potential change...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion is {{process of}} {{degradation}} or destruction of material especially metal because of reaction with its environment. Corrosion represent as problem {{which is very}} harm full so that the corrosion rate must be prevented or controlled. One of the way is by using impressed <b>current</b> <b>from</b> <b>external</b> electric <b>source</b> or Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP). Metal which often used by is steel, and metal which is used in this research is steel of AISI 018. The purpose {{of this research is}} to know the effectiveness of current usage and anode usage at cathodic protection with impressed current. The method used is by giving current equal to 0, 14 mA and 0, 43 mA and also use different anode, that is with scrap steel and copper, plunged into solution of Nacl 3 % during 3, 6, and 9 day. And the result which is obtained from the corrosion rate of steel at solution of NaCl is 0, 1461 mm/yr. While the corrosion rate with cathodic protection using scrap steel anode at current 0, 43 mA and 0, 14 mA each of 0, 0198 mm/yr and 0, 0559 mm/yr. And at cathodic protection using anode of scrap steel and cooper at current 0, 43 mA and 0, 14 mA each of 0, 0180 mm/yr and 0, 0505 mm/yr. The advantage of this research is we know the effective of value of current and usage of anode so that can applied to controlled corrosion rate of metal structure...|$|R
40|$|Effective monitoring, {{prevention}} and impact mitigation of nonindigenous aquatic species relies upon {{the ability to}} predict dispersal pathways and receiving habitats with the greatest risk of establishment. To examine mechanisms affecting species establishment within a large lake, we combined observations of recreational boater movements with empirical measurements of habitat suitability represented by nearshore wave energy to assess the relative risk of Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) establishment. The model was evaluated using information from a 17 year (1995 – 2012) sequence of M. spicatum presence and absence monitoring. M. spicatum presence was not specifically correlated with recreational boater movements; however its establishment appears to be limited by wave action in Lake Tahoe. Of the sites in the “High” establishment risk category (n = 37), 54 % had current or historical infestations, which included 8 of the 10 sites with the highest relative risk. Of the 11 sites in the “Medium” establishment risk category, 5 had current or historical M. spicatum populations. Most (76 %) of the sites in the “Low” establishment risk category were observed in locations with higher wave action. Four sites that received zero boater visits from infested locations were occupied by M. spicatum. This suggests that the boater survey either represents incomplete coverage of boater movement, or other processes, such as the movement of propagules by surface <b>currents</b> or introductions <b>from</b> <b>external</b> <b>sources</b> {{are important to the}} establishment of this species. This study showed the combination of habitat specific and dispersal data in a relative risk framework can potentially reduce uncertainty in estimates of invasion risk...|$|R
