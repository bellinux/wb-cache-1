500|$|In the 15th century, priest-physician Andrew Boorde {{describes}} a [...] "deworming technique" [...] for the teeth: [...] "And if it [...] do come by worms, make a <b>candle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wax</b> with Henbane seeds and light {{it and let}} the perfume of the candle enter into the tooth and gape over a dish of cold water and then you may take the worms {{out of the water}} and kill them on your nail." ...|$|E
50|$|During {{the plague}} {{epidemic}} in 1643, the aldermen of Lyon made the vow {{to organize a}} procession at Fourvière to implore the Virgin Mary to save the city. They carried a seven-pound <b>candle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wax</b> and a gold crown on a silk cushion. This gave the chocolatier Voisin, based in Lyon since 1897, {{the idea of using}} the shape of the cushion to create this confection in 1960. It has become the most popular French specialty confection containing chocolate ganache.|$|E
6000|$|For {{there was}} Robin supping at his table, [...] With <b>Candles</b> <b>of</b> pure <b>Wax,</b> [...] His Dame {{and his two}} {{beauteous}} little Children, [...] With Velvet on their backs.|$|R
6000|$|Now by {{this time}} the {{darkness}} being come, the damsel lit two tapers <b>of</b> perfumed <b>wax,</b> and thereafter she conducted Sir Ewaine into another apartment. There he beheld a couch, very soft and comfortable and spread with a coverlet of crimson satin. And the damsel Elose said: [...] "Sir Ewaine, doubtless thou art aweary. If that be so, here thou mayst rest thyself and be at ease." [...] And therewith she set down the <b>candles</b> <b>of</b> <b>wax</b> upon a table and quitted the room and Sir Ewaine was left alone.|$|R
60|$|Kari obeyed, and as I went up {{the stairs}} I buckled Wave-Flame about me. Also Kari brought two <b>candles</b> <b>of</b> Italian <b>wax</b> lighted upon their stands. Coming {{to the door of}} the solar I tried to open it, but it was bolted.|$|R

5000|$|Wax burning (...) , {{also known}} as wax boiling, is the heating <b>of</b> <b>candle</b> <b>wax</b> to high {{temperatures}} in a container {{as a form of}} entertainment.|$|R
5|$|Once {{the many}} layers <b>of</b> <b>candle</b> <b>wax,</b> varnish, and animal glue {{were removed from}} the surface of the Sistine Chapel frescoes, they became subject to dangers that could not have been {{predicted}} by previous restorers.|$|R
50|$|Fine wire (such as copper) can be {{included}} in the wick. This provides two advantages: it makes the wick more rigid, letting it stand further out <b>of</b> the liquid <b>wax,</b> and it conducts heat downward, melting the wax more readily. The latter is particularly important in <b>candles</b> made <b>of</b> harder <b>wax.</b>|$|R
60|$|He led the {{way into}} the dining room, and as I stood on the {{threshold}} a bolt of great brilliancy lighted its yellow-washed floor and walnut furniture of a staid pattern. A deafening crash followed as we took our seats, while Monsieur de St. Gre's man lighted four <b>candles</b> <b>of</b> green myrtle-berry <b>wax.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Marie-Julie Jahenny (1850-1941), {{known as}} the [...] "Breton Stigmatist", {{expanded}} upon {{the story of the}} Three Days of Darkness, saying that it will occur on a Thursday, Friday and Saturday when all of Hell will be let loose to strike at those outside their homes and those without a lit blessed <b>candle</b> <b>of</b> 100% pure <b>wax.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2007 he {{was invited}} to exhibit at St. Bartholomew the Great and created a large scale {{sculpture}} consisting of 200 kg <b>of</b> <b>candle</b> <b>wax</b> entitled ‘Atonement’ [...]A short film was created ‘Positive Negative’ depicting a crucifix undergoing reverse electroplation which was projected onto the wax sculpture.|$|R
60|$|<b>Candles</b> <b>of</b> {{clarified}} <b>wax</b> sparkled like {{stars in}} chandeliers of crystal. These in turn, catching the illumination, glittered in prismatic fragments {{with all the}} varied colors of the rainbow, so that a mellow yet brilliant radiance filled the entire apartment. Polished mirrors of a spotless clearness, framed in golden frames and built into the walls, reflected the waxed floors, the rich Oriental carpets, and the sumptuous paintings that hung against the ivory-tinted paneling, so that in appearance the beauties of the apartment were continued in bewildering vistas upon every side toward which the beholder directed his gaze.|$|R
5000|$|Trudon {{supplied}} the Versailles castle {{until the end}} of the monarchy. During his captivity, Louis XVI used the <b>candles</b> <b>of</b> his royal <b>wax</b> manufacturer. The blazon and the motto would be hidden under a layer of mortar to avoid the furies of the Revolution.It is still today the <b>candle</b> provider <b>of</b> many churches, like Saint-Roch church in Paris, which has burned their candles since 1643. The brand was successfully relaunched in 2006 [...]|$|R
5000|$|By early-April, Spriggs {{anchored}} off Roatan {{near the}} Bay of Honduras, where he ordered {{many of the}} prisoners captured during the voyages to be put ashore. Many of these prisoners displayed wounds inflicted by the pirates during their captivity and were subject to forms of torture such as being forced to eat plates <b>of</b> <b>candle</b> <b>wax.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dissolved gas {{flotation}} (DGF) {{systems are}} used {{for a variety of}} applications throughout the world. The process floats solids, oils and other contaminants to the surface of liquids. Once on the surface these contaminants are skimmed off and removed from the liquids. Oil and gas production facilities have used flotation systems to remove oil and solids from their produced and processed water (wastewater) for many years.The relative density <b>of</b> <b>candle</b> <b>wax</b> is 0.93, hence objects made <b>of</b> <b>wax</b> float on water.|$|R
60|$|The {{floor was}} spread with {{a carpet of}} the ruddy purple of porphyry, very soft and silent to the feet. From the frescoed ceiling, where a joyous Phoebus drove a team of {{spirited}} white stallions, hung a chain that was carved in the semblance of interlocked Titans to support a great candelabrum, each branch of {{which was in the}} image of a Titan holding a stout <b>candle</b> <b>of</b> scented <b>wax.</b> It was all in gilded bronze and the workmanship--as I was presently to learn--of that great artist and rogue Benvenuto Cellini. From this candelabrum there fell upon the board a soft golden radiance that struck bright gleams from crystals and plate of gold and silver.|$|R
6000|$|Anon {{came the}} damsel Elose, and she said: [...] "Sir Ewaine, the knight Sir Sagron is dead whom thou wounded yesterday, {{and now they}} are bearing him to the church. Come and see!" [...] So Sir Ewaine arose quickly and covered himself with a cloak, and he went with the damsel to a certain window that {{overlooked}} a street of the town. From that window and beneath him he beheld a great concourse of people that filled the entire street. Many of those were clad in armor of proof and others bare torches so that the entire night was aflame with the light thereof. And there were many women who rode upon horseback beside the armed knights. And all of this great assembly of people were crying out in lamentation so that it was as though all the hollow beneath the space of heaven were full of the voice of their sorrow. With this lamentation of many voices were mingled the sound of trumpets and the chaunting of priests and acolytes who recited the services for the dead. In the midst of all the press there was a bier, and over the bier there had been spread a veil of white linen and upon the bier there lay stretched the knight-champion of that place with his hands crossed upon his sword. All about the bier were many people carrying long <b>candles</b> <b>of</b> <b>wax,</b> and these also added their lamentation to the voices of those others who lamented.|$|R
60|$|The frank honest face, to {{tell the}} truth, at this moment bore any {{expression}} but one of openness and honesty: it was, on the contrary, much perturbed and puzzled in look. Jos was surveying the queer little apartment in which he found his old flame. One of her gowns hung over the bed, another depending from a hook of the door; her bonnet obscured half the looking-glass, on which, too, lay the prettiest little pair of bronze boots; a French novel {{was on the table}} by the bedside, with a <b>candle,</b> not <b>of</b> <b>wax.</b> Becky thought <b>of</b> popping that into the bed too, but she only put in the little paper night-cap with which she had put the candle out on going to sleep.|$|R
50|$|From {{this point}} on, candles {{came to be}} marketed {{as more of a}} {{decorative}} item. Candles became available in a broad array of sizes, shapes and colors, and consumer interest in scented candles began to grow. During the 1990s, new types <b>of</b> <b>candle</b> <b>waxes</b> were being developed due to an unusually high demand for candles. Paraffin, a by-product of oil, was quickly replaced by new waxes and wax blends due to rising costs.|$|R
50|$|Far {{away from}} the sterile, pseudo-sanctified realm of the art museum, Tino Rodriguez gained his first {{exposure}} to the art world in the Catholic churches of Mexico. In these mysterious, hushed interiors, images of saints and angels seduced him, the scent <b>of</b> <b>candle</b> <b>wax</b> and incense beguiled him. Angels in particular - androgynous, half animal-half human creatures - captivated Rodriguez with their allure. The legacy of this seduction is visible in Rodriguez’ work.|$|R
60|$|Austin, {{who decided}} {{that there was}} some reason in the query, strolled round the house, and came upon Jefferson sitting with his back to it and the box of {{dynamite}} on the deck in front of him. He looked gaunter and more haggard than ever in the daylight, but he was busy pinching down a copper cap upon a strip of snaky fuse, which he proceeded to carefully embed in a roll of semi-plastic material that looked very like a <b>candle</b> made <b>of</b> yellow <b>wax.</b>|$|R
50|$|This coal dust, {{plus the}} candle wax upon Page's clothing, led Spilsbury to the {{conclusion}} that the girl's body had been hidden in a coal cellar prior to her disposal at Addison Road, and that this cellar most likely had no electric light, as evidenced by the presence <b>of</b> <b>candle</b> <b>wax</b> also found upon the victim's clothing. One coal cellar close to Addison Road was found with its door ajar, and investigators theorised the girl's body had been hidden in this cellar after her murder.|$|R
50|$|Later, Rita crafts a Green <b>Candle</b> out <b>of</b> special <b>wax</b> {{that had}} been enchanted with Tommy's touch when he was evil. Once lit, the candle {{continues}} to burn until it is gone, and when it is, so too would Tommy's powers. Because Tommy's proximity to the candle accelerates the candle's melting process, Tommy is captured and placed in its proximity by Goldar. However, he eventually escapes and Jason is left to retrieve the candle. Jason does well in his fight with Goldar, but is recalled into the battle with Rita's Cyclops monster {{in order to save}} Tommy's life.|$|R
60|$|A young man, {{slender and}} {{singularly}} handsome, {{came forward and}} greeted him with an air at once courtly and affectionate. Hundreds <b>of</b> <b>candles,</b> <b>of</b> the finest <b>wax,</b> lit up a room that was perfumed, like the staircase, with a profusion of rare and beautiful flowering shrubs, A side-table was loaded with tempting viands. Several servants went to and fro with fruits and goblets of champagne. The company was perhaps sixteen in number, all men, few beyond the prime of life, and, with hardly an exception, of a dashing and capable exterior. They {{were divided into two}} groups, one about a roulette-board, and the other surrounding a table at which one of their number held a bank of baccarat.|$|R
50|$|The main {{products}} of the company are LPG, Motor Spirit, superior kerosene, aviation turbine fuel, high speed diesel, naphtha, bitumen, lube base stocks, paraffin wax, fuel oil, hexane and petrochemical feed stocks. The wax plant at CPCL has an installed capacity of 30,000 tonnes per annum, {{which is designed to}} produce paraffin <b>wax</b> for manufacture <b>of</b> <b>candle</b> <b>wax,</b> waterproof formulations and match wax. A propylene plant with a capacity of 17,000 tonnes per annum was commissioned in 1988 to supply petrochemical feedstock to neighbouring downstream industries. The unit was revamped to enhance the propylene production capacity to 30,000 tonnes per annum in 2004. CPCL also supplies LABFS to a downstream unit for the manufacture of liner alkyl benzene.|$|R
60|$|The {{other man}} went out, {{and the two}} who were left {{proceeded}} to nip down the fulminating caps on the strips of snaky fuse, after which they carefully embedded them in sundry plastic rolls, which looked very like big <b>candles</b> made <b>of</b> yellow <b>wax.</b> These they packed in an iron case, and then, carrying an axe and a big auger, {{went out of the}} tent. The rest of the men left at the ridge were waiting them, for every one understood the perilous nature of the attempt, though, as two men were sufficient for the work, there was nothing that they could do, and they proceeded in a body through the dripping undergrowth towards the gully. Here a big fire of resinous wood was lighted, and when at last the smoky glare flickered upon the wet rocks in the hollow, Brooke, who stripped to shirt and trousers, flung himself over the edge.|$|R
25|$|Also on {{the prairie}} is a series <b>of</b> <b>candle</b> holders called 'brulières' where pilgrims can place <b>candles</b> <b>of</b> varying sizes. Some pilgrimages {{transport}} large candles from their respective parishes. The brulières are tended by feutiers, attendants {{whose job is to}} ensure candles are burnt safely and evenly and to remove the trays <b>of</b> melted <b>wax</b> which collects under each brulière.|$|R
50|$|You Jiangu's <b>candle</b> clock {{consisted}} <b>of</b> six <b>candles</b> {{made from}} 72 pennyweights <b>of</b> <b>wax,</b> each being 12 inches high, of uniform thickness, and divided into 12 sections each of one inch. Each candle burned away completely in four hours, making each marking 20 minutes. The candles were placed for protection inside cases {{made of a}} wooden frame with transparent horn panels in the sides. Similar methods of measuring time were used in medieval churches and earlier, famously by King Alfred the Great of England, first by counting the number <b>of</b> <b>candles</b> <b>of</b> a specific size burnt, and later by use <b>of</b> a graduated <b>candle.</b>|$|R
50|$|Different types <b>of</b> <b>candles</b> produce {{different}} temperatures <b>of</b> <b>wax.</b> They {{can range}} from warm and soothing to dangerously hot wax. There is significant difference between individuals' tolerance for heat, which can vary depending on exactly where the wax is applied.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{when the}} light fell full on his features, Ambrose with a strange thrill of joy and trust {{perceived}} {{that it was no}} other than Dean Colet, who had here been praying against the fury of the people. He was very thankful, feeling intuitively that there was no fear but that Abenali would be understood, and for his own part, the very contact with the man whom he revered seemed to calm and soothe him, though on that solemn errand no word could be spoken. Ambrose went on slowly before, his dark head uncovered, the priestly stole hanging over his arm, his hands holding aloft the tall <b>candle</b> <b>of</b> virgin <b>wax,</b> while the Dean followed closely with feeble steps, looking frail and worn, but with a grave, sweet solemnity on his face. It was a perfectly still morning, and as they slowly paced along, the flame burnt steadily with little flickering, while the pure, delicately-coloured sky overhead was becoming every moment lighter, and only the larger stars were visible. The houses were absolutely still, and the only person they met, a lad creeping homewards after the fray, fell on his knees bareheaded as he perceived their errand. Once or twice again sounds came up from the city beneath, like shrieks or wailing breaking strangely on that fair peaceful May morn; but still that pair went on till Ambrose had guided the Dean to the yard, where, except that the daylight was revealing {{more and more of the}} wreck around, all was as he had left it. Aldonza, poor child, with her black hair hanging loose like a veil, for she had been startled from her bed, still sat on the ground making her lap a pillow for the white-bearded head, nobler and more venerable than ever. On it lay, in the absolute immobility produced by the paralysing blow, the fine features already in the solemn grandeur of death, and only the movement of the lips under the white flowing beard and of the dark eyes showing life.|$|R

In 2002 the Water Walk was introduced, across the Gave and slightly downstream from the Grotto. It consists of a series of nine stations at which there is a small Lourdes water font.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1850s, James Young {{succeeded in}} distilling {{paraffin}} wax from coal and oil shales at Bathgate in West Lothian {{and developed a}} commercially viable method of production. Paraffin {{could be used to}} make inexpensive <b>candles</b> <b>of</b> high quality. It was a bluish-white wax, burned cleanly, and left no unpleasant odor, unlike tallow candles. By the end of the 19th century, most candles being manufactured consisted <b>of</b> paraffin <b>wax</b> and stearic acid.|$|R
60|$|Then came {{two gentlemen}} bearing {{remarkable}} tall candlesticks, with <b>candles</b> <b>of</b> corresponding size. One was burning brightly, {{but the wind}} (that chartered libertine) had blown out the other, which nevertheless kept {{its place in the}} procession--I wondered to myself whether the reverend gentleman who carried the extinguished candle, felt disgusted, humiliated, mortified--perfectly conscious that the eyes of many thousands of people were bent upon that bit <b>of</b> refractory <b>wax.</b> We all <b>of</b> us looked at it with intense interest.|$|R
50|$|The {{practice}} <b>of</b> <b>wax</b> modelling can {{be traced}} through the Middle Ages, when votive offerings <b>of</b> <b>wax</b> figures were made to churches. The memory and lineaments of monarchs and great personages were preserved by means <b>of</b> <b>wax</b> masks.|$|R
40|$|The {{developmental}} degree <b>of</b> the <b>wax</b> glands {{was compared}} in four Meliponini bees, that produce different quantities <b>of</b> <b>wax.</b> The histological data and height average <b>of</b> the <b>wax</b> epithelium {{during the time}} in which the maximum production <b>of</b> <b>wax</b> is expected, are {{in accordance with the}} rates <b>of</b> <b>wax</b> produced by the species. In Lestrimelitta limao (Smith, 1863) a species which has cleptobiotic habits, and frequently rob wax from the attacked colonies, the height <b>of</b> <b>wax</b> epithelium was the lowest among the studied species. The cells seem to show an abnormal vacuolated cytoplasm, in the phase in which they would be producing wax...|$|R
