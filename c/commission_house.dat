2500|$|For {{the next}} 20 years, Williams, his wife, and {{children}} {{lived in the}} house. [...] Williams often lounged on the widow's walk. [...] At this time, Galveston Island had few trees or tall buildings, and from the widow's walk Williams could see the Gulf. He could also watch the horse races at a nearby race track which he co-owned with McKinney. He installed a telescope on the widow's walk, pointed towards the harbor. [...] It was customary for ships to flash signals as they approached land to inform the harbormaster {{of the types of}} cargo they carried. [...] Williams used his telescope to examine approaching ships; if one flashed the signal of an interesting cargo, Williams would rush downtown to start trading. [...] This gave him a competitive advantage over other merchants, who did not learn of the cargo until the ship was closer to shore. [...] Partially {{as a result of this}} tactic, the McKinney & Williams <b>commission</b> <b>house</b> [...] "was considered one of the wealthiest and most influential establishments in Texas".|$|E
