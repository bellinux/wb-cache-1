In lithographic [...] terms, the Lasseter graphic is not line art and often {{requires}} a screened, four <b>color</b> <b>photo</b> offset printing process for faithful reproduction on physical surfaces such as paper. Also, the BSD daemon {{was thought to be}} too graphically detailed for smooth size scaling and aesthetically over-dependent on multiple color gradations, making it hard to reliably reproduce as a simple, standardized logo in only two or three colors, much less in monochrome. Because of these worries, a competition was held and a new logo designed by Anton K. Gural, still echoing the BSD daemon, was released on 8 October 2005. However, it was announced by Robert Watson that, the FreeBSD project is [...] "seeking a new logo, but not a new mascot" [...] and that the FreeBSD project will continue to use Beastie as its mascot.|$|E

Inexplicably, several of the photographs are out of focus." [...] The review concluded, [...] "Despite its flaws, this book is packed with interesting faces and nice bodies, the stuff many dreams could be made of.

This eliminates any need for bridging and accommodates more intricate images. Glass gobos can also include colored areas (much like stained glass windows), whether by multiple layers of dichroic glass (one for each color) glued on an aluminium or chrome coated black and white gobo, or by newer technologies that vary {{the thickness of the}} dichroic coating (and therefore the color) in a controlled way on a single piece of glass—which makes it possible to turn a <b>color</b> <b>photo</b> into a glass gobo. Glass gobos generally offer the highest image fidelity, but are the most fragile. Glass gobos are typically created with laser ablation or photo etching.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As digital {{photography}} rapidly replacing the traditional film photography as the photography {{of choice for}} {{all but a few}} devoted professionals, post image processing of natural <b>color</b> <b>photos</b> such as denoising becomes increasingly an integral part of {{digital photography}}. Although many denoising schemes have been designed, almost none specifically target natural <b>color</b> <b>photos.</b> Noise in natural <b>color</b> <b>photos</b> have special characteristics that are substantially different from those that have been added artificially. In this paper we propose the multiscale total variational method (MTV) for denoising. Standing alone the MTV method is effective in denoising monochromatic images. However, it demonstrates outstanding denoising capabilities for natural color images. Key to the success is the understanding of the characteristics of digital noise in natural color images as well as a non-traditional color space we have introduced specifically for the purpose. An automatic stopping criterion is applied to each channel to prevent over processing. 1. Noise In Natural <b>Color</b> <b>Photos</b> With the surging popularity of digital cameras, digital photography is rapidly replacing the traditional film photography as the photography of choice for virtually all but a fe...|$|R
