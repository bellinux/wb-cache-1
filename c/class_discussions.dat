25|$|Those {{considered}} shy {{are also}} {{said to be}} socially inhibited. Social inhibition is the conscious or unconscious constraint by a person of behavior of a social nature. In other words, social inhibition is holding back for social reasons. There are different levels of social inhibition, from mild to severe. Being socially inhibited is good when preventing one from harming another and bad when causing one to refrain from participating in <b>class</b> <b>discussions.</b>|$|E

25|$|Students, faculty, staff, and {{visitors}} can enjoy artworks from {{the permanent collection}} while walking through university buildings or strolling across campuses. The permanent collection is available both physically and online {{for use as a}} teaching and learning tool for <b>class</b> <b>discussions,</b> to supplement or inspire individual and collaborative research or creative work, or as an opportunity to take a break from working and studying. A collection of over 15,000 works of art features public sculpture, prints and drawings, American Impressionism, Aboriginal art, Indian art, world photography, contemporary art, and more. Artists represented in the collection range from GVSU faculty, students, and alumni; to regional Michigan artists; to nationally and internationally renowned artists. Most of the collection is on view and can be found throughout university buildings on campuses in Allendale, Grand Rapids, Holland, Muskegon, Traverse City, and Detroit. The collection is available for viewing online at http://www.gvsu.edu/artgallery/.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} pedagogy {{of moderate}} expressivism {{is characterized by}} a focus on language as a tool for personal rather than social expression, based on the process theory of composition, a belief that the process of writing should be more important than the final product. Further, moderate expressivist pedagogy calls for less grammatical standards and an increased focus on the writer’s process of discovery and expression. W.E. Coles, Jr. suggests that teaching writing should be approached as teaching art, with the teacher serving as facilitator or guide for the student-writer’s free expression; he also calls for classroom practices such as peer-reviews, <b>class</b> <b>discussions,</b> and the absence of grades, in order to best guide the self-identification he sees as crucial to the writing process. Fellow moderate expressivist Donald Murray maintains that writing is a process of discovery and experimentation, a search for truth in a specious world; his manifesto-like essay provides an apt summation of the arguments against the dated pedagogy of CTR. Likewise, Maxine Hairston recognizes the paradigm shift occurring in rhetoric and composition and calls for a non-prescriptive atmosphere in teaching, including less focus on grammar and syntax and, again, more concern with the process of growth experienced by the writer. Peter Elbow reflects moderate expressivist ideals in his claim that audience should be ignored during {{the early stages of the}} writing process, in order to avoid the hindrance of audience expectation and facilitate writer-based rather than reader-based text. Elbow writes, “It’s not that writers should never think about their audience. It’s a question of when.” Simply put, moderate expressivism promotes the notion of process over product, a pedagogy that evolved in the height of the 1960s and in many ways reflects the ideologies of the era in its emphasis on freedom, expression, discovery, and a search for the writer’s authentic self.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the general}} public, the parity of zero {{can be a}} source of confusion. In {{reaction}} time experiments, most people are slower to identify 0 as even than 2, 4, 6, or 8. Some students of mathematics—and some teachers—think that zero is odd, or both even and odd, or neither. Researchers in mathematics education propose that these misconceptions can become learning opportunities. Studying equalities like [...] can address students' doubts about calling 0 a number and using it in arithmetic. <b>Class</b> <b>discussions</b> can lead students to appreciate the basic principles of mathematical reasoning, such as the importance of definitions. Evaluating the parity of this exceptional number is an early example of a pervasive theme in mathematics: the abstraction of a familiar concept to an unfamiliar setting.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the effect of the prewriting activities of <b>class</b> <b>discussion</b> and paired-student-interaction on the voluntary writing decisions of fourth graders. The sample consisted of 355 subjects: 185 males and 170 females. All subjects were fourth graders and attended seven Schools randomly selected from all elementary schools in a midwestern city school system. <b>Class</b> <b>discussion,</b> paired-student-interaction, and a control condition of no prewriting experience formed the three levels of the independent variable. The dependent variable consisted of whether or -riot the subject chose to participate in a writing activity. Grade level placement, time of clay, writing stimulus, and length of prewriting activity were control variables. Subjects were randomly assigned to the three treatment groups. The chi-square (x 2) test statistic for equality of three proportions was used to test each of the following null hypotheses at the. 05 level of significance. H 01 : There is no statistically significant difference among the three proportionsH 02 : of subjects choosing the writing activity corresponding co the three treatment groups for the male subjects. There is no statistically significant difference among the three proportions cf subjects choosing the writing activity corresponding to the three treatment groups for the female subjects. Ho 1 was not rejected. There was no significant difference among the proportions of males choosing to write from the three treatment groups. H 02 was rejected (P<- 05). Post hoc analyses comparing pairs of proportions for the female subjects indicated a significant difference between_ the <b>class</b> <b>discussion</b> treatment and the control condition. The proportion of girls in the Control Group choosing to write was significantly larger than the proportion of girls in the <b>Class</b> <b>Discussion</b> Group choosing to write. These results suggest that: 1. Oral language prewriting experiences have a differential effect on the willingness and females to write. 2. <b>Class</b> <b>discussion</b> and paired-student-interaction do not have an effect on the writing decisions of fourth grade boys. 3. <b>Class</b> <b>discussion</b> has a negative effect on the willingness of fourth grade girls to write.

40|$|ABSTRACT FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE TEACHERS’ USE, OR NON-USE, OF SMALL GROUP DISCUSSION by JULIANNE SNIDER August 2016 Advisor: Dr. Karen Feathers Major: Reading, Language, and Literature Degree: Doctor of Education This {{qualitative}} study explored teacher answers to one question: What factors influence teachers’ decisions to use, or not use, small group discussion. Research supports {{a variety of}} small group discussion approaches to meet a range of curricular goals. Despite the philosophical move to student-centered discussion approaches, and research supporting small group discussion as an effective literacy approach, teacher led whole <b>class</b> <b>discussion</b> continues as the dominant approach. An online teacher survey about teacher use of discussion generated fifteen teachers, grades two through eight, who were interviewed to gather data on their perspectives about student discussion. Three themes emerged from the interview data: (1) Teachers’ perspectives about their philosophy of education differed between teachers who used small group <b>discussion</b> and whole <b>class</b> <b>discussion,</b> (2) Teacher’s talk about students differed between teachers who used small group <b>discussion</b> and whole <b>class</b> <b>discussion,</b> and (3) Teachers’ talk about the teacher’s role or purpose differed between teachers who used small group <b>discussion</b> and whole <b>class</b> <b>discussion.</b> Based on the findings, the implications suggest that teachers who are successful at implementing small group discussion have reading related advanced degrees, they have adopted constructivist philosophies, perhaps through their advanced degrees in reading, and they benefit from administrative and collegial support. Without the reading education and the philosophy to support student-centered approaches, teacher comments revealed that even when school-wide literacy programs, designed to engage students in small group discussion, were implemented, teachers manipulated the program activities to fit their teacher-led style...|$|R
