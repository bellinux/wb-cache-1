6000|$|... "She {{said some}} things about the {{difference}} between your hideous character and your splendid stature. Called you a magnificent fellow--that was it. Well, then she choked up and <b>confessed</b> <b>something</b> to Sally in shame and disgrace." ...|$|R
60|$|Standing by in silence, I {{thought of}} the {{movement}} in the swing-door on the previous evening, and of the coat-tails which I had seen disappearing down the passage. Sergeant Cuff had, no doubt, just heard enough, before I interrupted him, to make him suspect that Rosanna had relieved her mind by <b>confessing</b> <b>something</b> to Mr. Franklin Blake.|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain Lingard, {{we forget}} {{how we have}} met, we forget what is going on. We mustn't. I won't say that you placed your belief wrongly but I have to <b>confess</b> <b>something</b> to you. I must tell you how I came here to-night. Jorgenson [...] ." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{the mention}} of Worth's name, Mr. Kirby started slightly, but nobody noticed it. Millicent went on in a {{trembling}} voice. [...] "We've come up to <b>confess</b> <b>something,</b> Mrs. Kirby. I'm sure you'll think it dreadful, but we didn't mean any harm. We just didn't realize, until afterwards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not to worry--not {{to strive}} nor struggle. To resign myself. To {{be content with}} little." [...] He spoke these {{sentences}} slowly, with short pauses between, and his intelligent regard was fixed on his visitor's with the conscious air {{of a man who}} has brought himself to <b>confess</b> <b>something.</b>|$|E
60|$|There is, {{it must be}} <b>confessed,</b> <b>something</b> {{very sad}} about the early efforts of an amateur in bagpipes. I have felt that myself when {{listening}} to my young friend. They {{appear to be a}} trying instrument to perform upon. You have to get enough breath for the whole tune before you start—at least, so I gathered from watching Jefferson.|$|R
6000|$|Eveline imposed {{silence on}} her indiscreet attendant, though herself exchanging a look with Rose which <b>confessed</b> <b>something</b> like timidity, as she {{commanded}} Raoul {{to blow the}} horn at the gate.

Before I tell you of the use that he made of his liberty of action, I must <b>confess</b> <b>something</b> {{relating}} to the prescriptions themselves.

6000|$|... "Fear! Do {{you really}} know me so little, my friend of few perceptions? Listen and I will <b>confess</b> <b>something.</b> I have fought for my life {{at least a dozen}} times, fought against odds which seemed almost hopeless. I have seen death with hungry, outstretched arms, within a few seconds' reach of me, but I have never felt fear. I do not know what it is. The length of one's life is purely a {{relative}} thing. It will come in ten or twenty years, if not to-morrow. Why not to-morrow?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{had hardly}} spoken when a sharp, firm ring {{at the door}} vibrated through the summer night. Catherine {{looked up at the}} clock; it marked a quarter-past nine--a very late hour for visitors, {{especially}} in the empty condition of the town. Mrs. Penniman at the same moment gave a little start, and then Catherine's eyes turned quickly to her aunt. They met Mrs. Penniman's and sounded them for a moment, sharply. Mrs. Penniman was blushing; her look was a conscious one; it seemed to <b>confess</b> <b>something.</b> Catherine guessed its meaning, and rose quickly from her chair.|$|E

6000|$|... 'It {{was a time}} {{to reveal}} {{the depths of the}} heart,' said Louis. 'A few words and the loss of the {{bracelet}} betrayed much: and afterwards, as far as a lady could, she <b>confessed</b> that <b>something</b> which passed between you the last evening--' ...|$|R
60|$|If {{the reader}} has not {{observed}} ere this that I was the declared admirer of Miss Fayaway, all I can say is, {{that he is}} little conversant with affairs of the heart, and I certainly shall not trouble myself to enlighten him any farther. Out of the calico I had brought from the ship a dress was made for this lovely girl. In it she looked, I must <b>confess,</b> <b>something</b> like an opera-dancer. The drapery of the latter damsel generally commences a little above the elbows, but my island beauty’s began at the waist, and terminated sufficiently far above the ground to reveal the most bewitching ankle in the universe.|$|E
60|$|It {{was late}} when I fell asleep. Though I was angry with old Cotter for {{alluding}} {{to me as}} a child, I puzzled my head to extract meaning from his unfinished sentences. In the dark of my room I imagined that I saw again the heavy grey face of the paralytic. I drew the blankets over my head and tried to think of Christmas. But the grey face still followed me. It murmured; and I understood that it desired to <b>confess</b> <b>something.</b> I felt my soul receding into some pleasant and vicious region; and there again I found it waiting for me. It began to confess to me in a murmuring voice and I wondered why it smiled continually and why the lips were so moist with spittle. But then I remembered that it had died of paralysis and I felt that I too was smiling feebly as if to absolve the simoniac of his sin.|$|E
6000|$|... "It will lighten your wonder to {{know that}} I come of a Greek stock planted in Italian soil much longer than the mulberry-trees which have taken so kindly to it. I was born at Bari, and my--I mean, I was brought up by an Italian--and, in fact, I am a Greek, very much as your peaches are Persian. The Greek dye was subdued in me, I suppose, till I had been dipped over again by long abode and much travel {{in the land of}} gods and heroes. And, to <b>confess</b> <b>something</b> of my private affairs to you, this same Greek dye, with a few ancient gems I have about me, is the only fortune {{shipwreck}} has left me. But--when the towers fall, you know it is an ill business for the small nest-builders--the death of your Pericles makes me wish I had rather turned my steps towards Rome, as I should have done but for a fallacious Minerva in the shape of an Augustinian monk. `At Rome,' he said, `you will be lost in a crowd of hungry scholars; but at Florence, every corner is penetrated by the sunshine of Lorenzo's patronage: Florence is the best market in Italy for such commodities as yours.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|At dinner, [...] "The Game" [...] is played, {{where each}} {{person at the}} table <b>confesses</b> <b>something</b> ("Full Disclosure"). Gomez tells a story about scaring away crows and their feet, but upsets Morticia by accidentally {{comparing}} her to a goat, while Uncle Fester admits he's {{in love with the}} moon. In a mix-up, Alice drinks Pugsley's potion and in front of everyone declares her marriage to Mal a loveless mess as she reveals her misery and woe ("Waiting"). As Mal, humiliated, attempts to leave with his family, Wednesday announces that she and Lucas are getting married, to which Lucas sheepishly agrees. Chaos engulfs both families, and Uncle Fester, trying to be helpful, instructs the Ancestors to create a sudden, terrible storm, trapping everyone in the mansion for the night ("Full Disclosure - Part 2").|$|R
25|$|Lovelace {{died at the}} age of 36– {{the same}} age that her father had died– on 27 November 1852, from uterine cancer {{probably}} exacerbated by bloodletting by her physicians. The illness lasted several months, in which time Annabella took command over whom Ada saw, and excluded all of her friends and confidants. Under her mother's influence, she had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making Annabella her executor. She lost contact with her husband after she <b>confessed</b> <b>something</b> to him on 30 August which caused him to abandon her bedside. What she told him is unknown. She was buried, at her request, next to her father at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. A memorial plaque in Latin to her and her father is in the chapel attached to Horsley Towers.|$|R

60|$|They saw at {{last that}} there was nothing for it but to carry to the king the sad tidings of his beloved daughter's disappearance. And what great weeping and lamentation there was in the palace when the dreadful news was told! The king tore his robes, dashed his golden crown from his head, and hid his face in his purple mantle for grief and anguish at the loss of the princess. After the first {{outburst}} of wailing, however, he took heart and hurried off to see for himself the scene of this strange adventure, thinking, as people will in sorrow, that there might be some mistake after all. But when he reached the spot, behold, all was changed again! The glittering grotto described to him by the maidens had completely vanished, and so had the marble bath, the bower of jasmine; instead, all was a tangle of flowers, as it had been of old. The king was so much perplexed that he threatened the princess's playfellows with all sorts of punishments if they would not <b>confess</b> <b>something</b> about her disappearance; but as they only repeated the same story he presently put down the whole affair to the work of some sprite or goblin, and tried to console himself for his loss by ordering a grand hunt; for kings cannot bear to be troubled about anything long.|$|E
60|$|The idea of {{infinite}} has, I <b>confess,</b> <b>something</b> of positive {{in all those}} things we apply to it. When we would think {{of infinite}} space or duration, we at first step usually make some very large idea, as perhaps of millions of ages, or miles, which possibly we double and multiply several times. All that we thus amass together in our thoughts is positive, and the assemblage of {{a great number of}} positive ideas of space or duration. But what still remains beyond this we have no more a positive distinct notion of than a mariner has of the depth of the sea; where, having let down a large portion of his sounding-line, he reaches no bottom. Whereby he knows the depth to be so many fathoms, and more; but how much the more is, he hath no distinct notion at all: and could he always supply new line, and find the plummet always sink, without ever stopping, he would be something in the posture of the mind reaching after a complete and positive idea of infinity. In which case, let this line be ten, or ten thousand fathoms long, it equally discovers what is beyond it, and gives only this confused and comparative idea, that this is not all, but one may yet go farther. So much as the mind comprehends of any space, it has a positive idea of: but in endeavouring to make it infinite,--it being always enlarging, always advancing,--the idea is still imperfect and incomplete. So much space as the mind takes a view of in its contemplation of greatness, is a clear picture, and positive in the understanding: but infinite is still greater. 1. Then the idea of SO MUCH is positive and clear. 2. The idea of GREATER is also clear; but it is but a comparative idea, the idea of SO MUCH GREATER AS CANNOT BE COMPREHENDED. 3. And this is plainly negative: not positive. For he has no positive clear idea of the largeness of any extension, (which is that sought for in the idea of infinite), that has not a comprehensive idea of the dimensions of it: and such, nobody, I think, pretends to in what is infinite. For to say a man has a positive clear idea of any quantity, without knowing how great it is, is as reasonable as to say, he has the positive clear idea of the number of the sands on the sea-shore, who knows not how many there be, but only that they are more than twenty. For just such a perfect and positive idea has he of an infinite space or duration, who says it is LARGER THAN the extent or duration of ten, one hundred, one thousand, or any other number of miles, or years, whereof he has or can have a positive idea; which is all the idea, I think, we have of infinite. So that what lies beyond our positive idea TOWARDS infinity, lies in obscurity, and has the indeterminate confusion of a negative idea, wherein I know I neither do nor can comprehend all I would, it being too large for a finite and narrow capacity. And that cannot but be very far from a positive complete idea, wherein the greatest part of what I would comprehend is left out, under the undeterminate intimation of being still greater. For to say, that, having in any quantity measured so much, or gone so far, you are not yet at the end, is only to say that that quantity is greater. So that the negation of an end in any quantity is, in other words, only {{to say that it is}} bigger; and a total negation of an end is but carrying this bigger still with you, in all the progressions your thoughts shall make in quantity; and adding this IDEA OF STILL GREATER to ALL the ideas you have, or can be supposed to have, of quantity. Now, whether such an idea as that be positive, I leave any one to consider.|$|E
5000|$|The first Marvel super-villain {{known as}} the Wrecker fought Giant-Man and the Wasp in Tales to Astonish 63.

50|$|Part III of A Man Could Stand Up — {{begins as}} Valentine comes to Gray’s Inn {{in order to}} meet Christopher. Mrs Wannop, Valentine’s mother, and wife of Christopher’s father’s oldest friend, finds out, and seeks to prevent them {{becoming}} lovers. She telephones them, appealing to them both in different, highly manipulative, ways. While she talks to Tietjens, Valentine begins to learn about his war experiences as men from his unit arrive, honouring their promises to look him up; Tietjens, meanwhile, has <b>confessed</b> <b>something</b> of his continuing psychological and emotional terrors to Mrs Wannop. The drunken celebration and dance which ensues contains within it all the tensions of the inter-relationships between the men, as well as their combined experiences. Valentine finds herself thinking of Sylvia Tietjens more than once. The energy of the dance is compelling, and, a microcosm of Armistice Day, it draws volume 3 of Parade's End to a close.|$|R

As the White party ends, Chuck attempts to reconcile with Blair but she gives him an ultimatum: to confess his love for her or she'll leave with Marcus. Unable to express his love, Blair leaves the party with Marcus.|$|E
