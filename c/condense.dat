5|$|A tornado is not {{necessarily}} visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (as described by Bernoulli's principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause water vapor {{in the air to}} <b>condense</b> into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling. This results in the formation of a visible funnel cloud or condensation funnel.|$|E
5|$|All air well designs {{incorporate}} a substrate with a temperature sufficiently low so that dew forms. Dew {{is a form}} of precipitation that occurs naturally when atmospheric water vapour condenses onto a substrate. It is distinct from fog, in that fog is made of droplets of water that <b>condense</b> around particles in the air. Condensation releases latent heat which must be dissipated in order for water collection to continue.|$|E

5|$|Heavy metals <b>condense</b> in planets as {{a result}} of stellar {{evolution}} and destruction processes. Stars lose much of their mass when it is ejected late in their lifetimes, and sometimes thereafter {{as a result}} of a neutron star merger, thereby increasing the abundance of elements heavier than helium in the interstellar medium. When gravitational attraction causes this matter to coalesce and collapse new stars and planets are formed.|$|E
5|$|It is {{recommended}} that deep fryers be cleaned often to prevent contamination. The process of cooking with oil can also contaminate nearby surfaces as oil may splatter on adjacent areas. Oil vapors can also <b>condense</b> on more distant surfaces such as walls and ceilings. Supplies such as dish detergent and baking soda can effectively clean affected surfaces.|$|E
5000|$|... {{a type of}} {{heat pipe}} which will only allow heat to flow from the {{evaporator}} to the <b>condenser.</b> When the <b>condenser</b> is hotter than the evaporator, the coolant in the heat pipe <b>condenses</b> in a reservoir at the evaporator end. This reservoir {{does not have a}} capillary connection with the <b>condenser,</b> preventing the liquid from returning to the <b>condenser.</b> During normal heat pipe operation, when the evaporator and reservoir become hotter than the <b>condenser,</b> the reservoir is emptied by evaporation, and heat is transferred to the <b>condenser.</b>|$|R

5|$|Stars <b>condense</b> from {{regions of}} space of higher matter density, yet those regions are less dense than within a vacuum chamber. These regions – known as {{molecular}} clouds – consist mostly of hydrogen, with about 23 to 28 percent helium {{and a few}} percent heavier elements.

5|$|The fogstand beetle of the Namib Desert, Stenocara gracilipes, is able {{to collect}} water from fog, as its elytra have a {{textured}} surface combining hydrophilic (water-loving) bumps and waxy, hydrophobic troughs. The beetle faces the early morning breeze, holding up its abdomen; droplets <b>condense</b> on the elytra and run along ridges towards their mouthparts. Similar adaptations are found in several other Namib desert beetles such as Onymacris unguicularis.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifespan}} of the accretion disks {{is about}} 10millionyears. By {{the time the}} star reaches the classical T-Tauri stage, the disk becomes thinner and cools. Less volatile materials start to <b>condense</b> close to its center, forming 0.1–1μm dust grains that contain crystalline silicates. The transport of the material from the outer disk can mix these newly formed dust grains with primordial ones, which contain organic matter and other volatiles. This mixing can explain some peculiarities {{in the composition of}} Solar System bodies such as the presence of interstellar grains in the primitive meteorites and refractory inclusions in comets.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the {{somewhat}} reddish Pluto and Triton, Eris appears almost white. Pluto's reddish color {{is thought to}} be due to deposits of tholins on its surface, and where these deposits darken the surface, the lower albedo leads to higher temperatures and the evaporation of methane deposits. In contrast, Eris is far enough from the Sun that methane can <b>condense</b> onto its surface even where the albedo is low. The condensation of methane uniformly over the surface reduces any albedo contrasts and would cover up any deposits of red tholins.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sufficient}} for the Southern Railway's needs, the Nclass was an ideal test-bed for experiments with new steam technology. The first experiment entailed fitting a Worthington feed pump to No.A819 in 1924. The trial was moderately successful, and the pump remained in use until removal in 1927. In June 1930, No.A816 was withdrawn from service {{for the application of}} experimental Anderson steam conservation equipment at Eastleigh Works. This was designed by a Scottish marine draughtsman, Mr. A.P.H. Anderson, who proposed the use of a fan system to <b>condense</b> spent steam and improve draughting of the fire on long-distance runs in regions with poor access to water.|$|E
5|$|At {{atmospheric}} pressure, {{molecular nitrogen}} condenses (liquefies) at 77K (−195.79°C) and freezes at 63K (−210.01°C) into the beta hexagonal close-packed crystal allotropic form. Below 35.4K (−237.6°C) nitrogen assumes the cubic crystal allotropic form (called the alpha phase). Liquid nitrogen, a colourless fluid resembling water in appearance, but with 80.8% of the density (the density of liquid nitrogen at its boiling point is 0.808g/mL), {{is a common}} cryogen. Solid nitrogen has many crystalline modifications. It forms a significant dynamic surface coverage on Pluto and outer moons of the Solar System such as Triton. Even at the low temperatures of solid nitrogen it is fairly volatile and can sublime to form an atmosphere, or <b>condense</b> back into nitrogen frost. It is very weak and flows {{in the form of}} glaciers and on Triton geysers of nitrogen gas come from the polar ice cap region.|$|E

Beginning in 1951, tests with the <b>condensing</b> Class 20 were conducted in the Eastern Transvaal and the Karoo.

5|$|Because it {{is lighter}} than air, {{airships}} and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane {{at a lower}} rate, helium {{has the advantage of}} being non-flammable, and indeed fire-retardant. Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to <b>condense</b> hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000m3 (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.|$|E
5|$|Clouds {{typically}} cover 1% of Titan's disk, though outburst {{events have}} been observed in which the cloud cover rapidly expands {{to as much as}} 8%. One hypothesis asserts that the southern clouds are formed when heightened levels of sunlight during the southern summer generate uplift in the atmosphere, resulting in convection. This explanation is {{complicated by the fact that}} cloud formation has been observed not only after the southern summer solstice but also during mid-spring. Increased methane humidity at the south pole possibly contributes to the rapid increases in cloud size. It was summer in Titan's southern hemisphere until 2010, when Saturn's orbit, which governs Titan's motion, moved Titan's northern hemisphere into the sunlight. When the seasons switch, it is expected that ethane will begin to <b>condense</b> over the south pole.|$|E
