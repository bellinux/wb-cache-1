30|$|As several {{cross-sectional}} {{studies have}} compliant samples, some results {{have to be}} taken into account with caution. The low rate of male master swimmer participation (24  %) <b>could</b> <b>affect</b> specific results concerning this gender. The free participation has limited master swimmers involved in a lot of races or selected only for 1  day of the event. It is difficult to consider that the male sample was representative of all male swimmers, even if the chi-squared test showed that the sample was not significantly different from the male master population. The second limit of this study was the old reference studies used to define standard values of health parameters. Unfortunately, our research in the standard baselines did not find more recent studies with standard values in France or Europe by age and gender. In this way, we had to adjust the age classes in our statistical methodology, which <b>could</b> <b>affect</b> statistical significance. Finally, the competitive context <b>could</b> <b>affect</b> some behavior such as anxiety, pain perception, or physical activity 7  days before the event, which <b>could</b> <b>affect</b> some health parameter values.|$|R
