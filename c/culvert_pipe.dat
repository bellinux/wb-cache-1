40|$|Pennsylvania {{contains}} approximately 83, 000 miles (133, 547 km) of {{streams and}} 119, 000 miles (191, 471 km) of public roadways. Fish movement can be impeded by highway culvert designs that create sheet flow or increased current velocity within the culvert barrel, and/or perched outlet conditions. The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation reviewed performance measures of existing culvert designs and conducted a literature review to develop culvert designs that enhance fish passage. Design guidelines were established for <b>pipe</b> <b>culverts</b> and statewide design standards {{have been adopted}} for single cell and twin cell box <b>culverts.</b> <b>Pipe</b> <b>culverts</b> can be depressed at varying depths below streambed elevation depending upon the upstream drainage area and {{the diameter of the}} pipe. Single and twin cell box culverts are depressed twelve inches (305 mm) below streambed elevation. Box culverts installed in waterways with a stream slope less than four percent are constructed with a different baffle design than those installed with stream slopes greater than four percent. Stream flows are directed to the primary cell of the twin cell box culvert structure while the secondary cell is designed only to accept storm flows. All culvert structures are installed parallel to stream gradient and riprap used to protect the inlet and outlet is placed to match the invert elevation of the structure...|$|R
5000|$|Beaver Pipes were {{installed}} in 2009 by Enzo Creek's management to help control {{the water level}} in Hunt Marsh, which had been steadily growing since 2005. This method of water control proved to be ineffective as beavers were able to block water passage through the pipes. The beaver pipes were ultimately removed completely, and a much larger 20" [...] <b>culvert</b> <b>pipe</b> was installed through the dam and encased with hog wire fencing to prevent beavers from stuffing the pipe full of timber to block water passage.

40|$|The {{primary reason}} for using steam in the curing of {{concrete}} is to produce a high early strength. This high early strength is very desirable to the manufacturers of precast and prestressed concrete units, which often require expensive forms or stress beds.

Steam curing accelerates the gain in strength at early ages, but the uncontrolled use of steam may seriously affect the growth in strength at later ages. The research described in this report was prompted by the need to establish realistic controls and specifications for the steam curing of pretensioned, prestressed concrete bridge beams and concrete <b>culvert</b> <b>pipe</b> manufactured in central plants.

Weighing approximately 10 pounds, the Snake Robot can be tele-operated from miles away, can reliably traverse challenging terrains including stairs, <b>culverts,</b> <b>pipes,</b> tanks, and many vertical surfaces, and can facilitate two-way real-time video and voice communication. The Sarcos Scorpion Robot is an advanced {{version of the}} Snake Robot, equipped with precision, force-sensing end-effectors to enable highly dexterous tasks under tele-operation control. As a remote inspection and monitoring tool with optional interventional capabilities, the Snake and Scorpion Robots have wide applicability in industries ranging from public safety, security, non-destructive testing, defense, disaster recovery, infrastructure inspection and maintenance, aerospace, maritime, oil and gas, and mining. Presently, Sarcos is demonstrating the Guardian S robot to public safety personnel as a robot that can solve existing unmet public safety needs, such as being a “man-portable”, having superior surveillance capabilities, possessing the ability to climb stairs and over vehicles, and having optional end-effectors {{in the future that}} can dexterously manipulate and defuse explosive devices.|$|R
40|$|Stream burial—the routing of streams through <b>culverts,</b> <b>pipes,</b> and {{concrete}} lined channels, or simply paving them over—is common during urbanization, and disproportionately affects small, headwater streams. Burial undermines {{the physical and}} chemical processes governing life in streams, with consequences for water quality and quantity that may amplify from headwaters to downstream receiving waters. Knowledge {{of the extent of}} stream burial is critical for understanding cumulative impacts to stream networks, and for future decision-making allowing for urban development while protecting ecosystem function. We predicted stream burial across the urbanizing Potomac River Basin (USA) for each 10 -m stream segment in the basin from medium-resolution impervious cover data and training observations obtained from high-resolution aerial photography in a GIS. Results were analyzed across a range in spatial aggregation, including counties and independent cities, small watersheds, and regular spatial grids. Stream burial was generally correlated with total impervious surface area (ISA), with areas exhibiting ISA above 30 % often subject to elevated ratios of stream burial. Recurring patterns in burial predictions related to catchment area and topographic slope were also detected. We discuss these results in the context of physiographic constraints on stream location and urban development, including implications for environmental management of aquatic resources...|$|R
