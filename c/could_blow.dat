5|$|In the United States, Rick had a {{temporary}} economic impact when, during its time off {{the shore of}} Chiapas and Oaxaca, it caused the price of coffee to rise 4.7 percent to $1.5685 per pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, the highest total it reached since October 16. Mexico is the United States's largest source of coffee imports and Oaxaca and Chiapas are the largest coffee growing regions in Mexico. Like the impact in El Tomatal, Rick's effects were much worse than Pauline's because Rick threatened the coffee crop when the beans were more susceptible to winds that <b>could</b> <b>blow</b> them off.|$|E
25|$|In one instance, Shaw and Edwards {{were asked}} to move small objects in a sealed {{transparent}} globe, normally small bits of paper balanced on an edge. At first {{they were unable to}} get anything to happen, but later noticed that the container was being removed to replace the object within. During one such event they took the opportunity to roll up a small ball of metal foil and drop it into the circular ring cut into the surface of the table that held the globe. This introduced a small gap under one edge, which they <b>could</b> <b>blow</b> into to cause the paper to move.|$|E
25|$|At Riqueval {{they got}} {{an even bigger}} prize: the Germans had left the {{concrete}} bridge standing as the main supply route for their troops on the western bank. The bridge had been prepared for demolition, but the Germans considered the sector impregnable. A company of 6th North Staffs was detailed to rush the bridge before the Germans <b>could</b> <b>blow</b> it. Captain A.H. Charlton and nine men dashed out of the fog, bayoneted the machine-gunners guarding the west end, and ran across the bridge in a race with the demolition party emerging from a bunker at the east end (where a memorial erected by the Western Front Association now stands). The Staffords won the race, shooting the Germans and cutting the leads to the demolition charges.|$|E

25|$|A {{platoon of}} five M26s, less {{one that was}} being serviced, {{played a key role}} in helping Combat Command B of the 9th Armored capture the Ludendorff Bridge during the Battle of Remagen on March 7–8, 1945, {{providing}} fire support to the infantry in order to take the bridgehead before the Germans <b>could</b> <b>blow</b> it up. In encounters with Tigers and Panthers, the M26 performed well. Some of the division's other tanks were able to cross the bridge, but the T26E3s were too large and heavy to cross the damaged bridge and had to wait five days before getting across the river by barge. Europe's bridges were in general not designed for heavy loads, which had been one of the original objections to sending a heavy tank to Europe.|$|E

500|$|Hōshōs {{flight deck}} was [...] long and [...] wide. The forward end sloped down {{at an angle}} of −5° to help {{aircraft}} accelerate during takeoff. A small island was mounted well forward on the starboard side and contained the ship's bridge and air operations control center. The island was fitted with a small tripod mast intended to mount the ship's fire-control system. Fifteen different types of landing equipment were evaluated before the British longitudinal wire system was adopted. Low landing speeds of the time meant that aircraft had little difficulty in stopping, but their light weight made them vulnerable to wind gusts that <b>could</b> <b>blow</b> them {{over the side of}} the carrier, and the longitudinal wires helped to prevent that. Forward of the island was a collapsible crane for loading aircraft into the forward hangar.|$|E

500|$|Although the New York Dolls {{exhibited}} tongue-in-cheek qualities, Gary Graff {{observed a}} streetwise realism in the album's songs. In Christgau's opinion, Johansen's colloquial and morally superior lyrics were imbued with humor {{and a sense}} of human limits in songs whose fundamental theme was authenticity. This theme was explored in stories about lost youths, as on [...] "Subway Train", or in a study of a specific subject, such as the [...] "schizy imagemonger" [...] on [...] "Personality Crisis". He argued that beneath the band's decadent and campy surface were lyrics about [...] "the modern world... one nuclear bomb <b>could</b> <b>blow</b> it all away. Pills and personality crises weren't evils—easy, necessary, or whatever. They were strategies and tropisms and positive pleasures". According to journalist Steve Taylor, [...] "Vietnamese Baby" [...] dealt with the impact of the Vietnam War at the time on everyday activities for people, whose fun was undermined by thoughts of collective guilt.|$|E
500|$|Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club said {{although}} {{he liked the}} pilot episode, he thought jokes in [...] "Canvassing" [...] were [...] "pretty thin on the ground", the supporting cast lacked good material and the Leslie character was less likable than the previous week. Phipps, who gave the episode a C grade, said, [...] "This wasn’t a terrible half-hour of comedy by any stretch. It drifted by easily enough. But I’m already having to scour my notes to remind myself {{of the stuff that}} was funny." [...] "Canvassing" [...] was first broadcast in Australia on Channel Seven on December 8, 2009, and received a positive review from The Sydney Morning Herald writer Mark Ellis. He particularly praised Poehler and Ansari, and said of the episode, [...] "Tune in just to hear her say to her canvassing companion, who complains it's hot and wants to cool off: 'We <b>could</b> <b>blow</b> in each other's faces.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{weather and}} {{conditions}} on the grid were before dry for the race. The air temperature was [...] with signs of a breeze which <b>could</b> <b>blow</b> sand onto the track and impede the cars' grip. Massa got the best start of the frontrunners off the line, as he passed Kubica into the first corner to take the lead. Hamilton's poor start caused his anti-stall system to kick in, and he was passed by six drivers to fall back to ninth. Räikkönen benefited from Hamilton's start by moving up to third, ahead of Kovalainen, Trulli and Heidfeld. As Massa extended his lead {{at the front of}} the race, Hamilton, who trailed Alonso, collided with the back of the Renault, knocking the McLaren's front wing off the car. Suffering handling difficulties, Hamilton returned to the pit-lane for a new nose section, and rejoined in 18th place. Räikkönen took second place when he passed Kubica on lap three; Heidfeld took fourth when he passed Trulli and Kovalainen in separate manoeuvres. Further down the field, Vettel retired from the race on the first lap after twice colliding with other cars; Button, Sutil and Coulthard pitted to repair early damage.|$|E

500|$|A {{two-level}} hangar {{was built}} under the flight deck, each level being [...] high. The lower hangar was [...] long by [...] wide {{and the upper}} was [...] Each hangar could be sectioned off by electrically operated steel shutters on rollers. Her boilers were ducted {{down the side of}} the ship to exhaust either out of gratings at the rear of the flight deck, or, when landing operations were in progress, out of the side of the lower hangar at the rear of the ship. This solution proved to be very unsatisfactory as it consumed valuable space, made parts of the lower hangar unbearable and interfered with landing operations to a greater or lesser degree. Her original flying-off deck remained in place for use by small aircraft like fighters so that the ship could simultaneously land aircraft on the main flight deck while fighters were taking off on the lower deck and could speedily launch her aircraft from both decks. Doors at the forward end of the upper hangar opened onto the lower flying deck. Two [...] lifts (elevators) were installed to transfer aircraft between the flight deck and hangars. Two [...] ready-use petrol tanks were provided for aircraft and the ship's boats on the upper deck. An additional [...] of petrol were in bulk storage. The longitudinal arresting gear proved unpopular in service and it was ordered removed in 1927 after tests aboard Furious in 1926 had shown that deck-edge palisades were effective in reducing cross-deck gusts that <b>could</b> <b>blow</b> aircraft over the side. Furiouss long exhaust ducting hampered landing operations, and restricted the size of the hangars and thus the number of aircraft that she could carry.|$|E
2500|$|Every {{battalion}} in America {{had organized}} its own rifle company {{by the end}} of the war, although rifles were not formally issued to the army until the Baker Rifle in 1801. Flintlocks were heavily dependent on the weather; high winds <b>could</b> <b>blow</b> the gunpowder from the flash pan, while heavy rain could soak the paper cartridge, ruining the powder and rendering the musket unable to fire. Furthermore, flints used in British muskets were of notoriously poor quality; they could only be fired around six times before requiring resharpening, while American flints could fire sixty. This led to a common expression among the British: [...] "Yankee flint was as good as a glass of grog".|$|E

Additional screen portrayals included the boy who <b>could</b> <b>blow</b> his whistle while standing on his head in Sunday Dinner for a Soldier (1944), the [...] "child brother" [...] of Richard Arlen in The Big Bonanza (1944), and young Percy Maxim in So Goes My Love (1946), with Don Ameche and Myrna Loy.

[...] Then all of the boys would run for their rooms. [...] At nine o’clock the second call was given, when all lights were tuned out and we were supposed to be in bed. [...] Later on I learned the mess call, and eventually <b>could</b> <b>blow</b> all the calls of the regular army.” The Carlisle Indian band of brass instruments performed at football games, world expositions and presidential inaugural parades.

2500|$|Norris' {{change in}} {{position}} received varying reactions from commentators.

2500|$|Swengel {{went on to}} {{note that}} [...] "at low {{temperature}} and relatively low boiler outputs", good water and regular boiler washout was an acceptable practice, even though such maintenance was high. As steam pressures increased, however, a problem of [...] "foaming" [...] or [...] "priming" [...] developed in the boiler, wherein dissolved solids in the water formed [...] "tough-skinned bubbles" [...] inside the boiler, which in turn were carried into the steam pipes and <b>could</b> <b>blow</b> off the cylinder heads. To overcome the problem, hot mineral-concentrated water was deliberately wasted (blown down) from the boiler periodically. Higher steam pressures required more blowing-down of {{water out of the}} boiler. Oxygen generated by boiling water attacks the boiler, and with increased steam pressure the rate of rust (iron oxide) generated inside the boiler increases. One way to help overcome the problem was water treatment. Swengel suggested that these problems contributed to the interest in electrification of railways.|$|E

2500|$|Oliver's {{band was}} among the most {{influential}} jazz bands in Chicago in the early 1920s, at a time when Chicago {{was the center of the}} jazz universe.

Excited as he was to be in Chicago, he began his career-long pastime of writing nostalgic letters to friends in New Orleans. Unusually, Armstrong <b>could</b> <b>blow</b> two hundred high Cs in a row. As his reputation grew, he was challenged to instrumental [...] "cutting contests" [...] by hornmen trying to displace him. Armstrong made his first recordings on the Gennett and Okeh labels (jazz records were starting to boom across the country), including taking some solos and breaks, while playing second cornet in Oliver's band in 1923. At this time, he met Hoagy Carmichael (with whom he would collaborate later) who was introduced by friend Bix Beiderbecke, who now had his own Chicago band.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{devastating to}} the Comanche, their legendary Chief, Phohebits Quasho, Iron Jacket, [...] "professed to blow arrows aside from their aim", {{was killed in}} the fighting.

[...] Iron Jacket, an older man, probably in his 60's at the time, had rallied his men after warning had arrived of the attack on the first small group of lodges a short distance from his encampment, and had ridden {{directly in front of the}} attacking Rangers and Indians challenging them to individual combat. [...] While this had worked in his battles with previous foes, who lacked the powerful weapons able to penetrate the Armour he wore, it got him killed at Little Robe Creek. [...] His warriors were badly distressed by his death, as Iron Jacket had explained his breath <b>could</b> <b>blow</b> bullets away.
