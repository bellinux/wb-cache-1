5|$|During the Camillan era, {{they fought}} {{in a shallow}} phalanx formation, {{supported}} by light troops. In most battles triarii were not used because the lighter troops usually defeated the enemy before the triarii were committed to the battle. They {{were meant to be}} used as a decisive force in the battle, thus prompting an old Roman saying: 'It <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the triarii' (res ad triarios venit), which meant carrying on to the bitter end.|$|E
5|$|A paper {{airplane}} {{contest is}} being hosted at Dunder Mifflin {{by a new}} paper supplier. All of the office workers compete against {{each other for a}} $2,000 prize. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) in particular is fiercely competitive, and even as she realizes that she is showing an ugly side of herself to her boyfriend Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), she cannot hold back from smashing a box of packing peanuts when she loses in the semi-finals. After several intense rounds, it <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey). Dwight, who is dating Esther (Nora Kirkpatrick), tries to throw the contest. Angela is flattered by the gesture. However, when Esther expresses her condolences to Angela about her financial situation since her husband separated from her, she realizes that Dwight is letting her win out of pity, not love. Angered, she rebuffs Dwight's pity and lets him win the contest.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the {{ownership}} {{group of the}} Canucks, now owned by Francesco Aquilini, announced they were considering purchasing the Hornets. In December 2010, the Hornets were bought by the league, and there was potential for relocation due to the club's financial difficulties. However, a Hornets move was effectively taken off the table in 2012 when Tom Benson, a New Orleans native who already owned the NFL's New Orleans Saints, purchased the team. One year later, Aquilini denied rumours {{that he wanted to}} purchase the Sacramento Kings from the Maloof family. Aquilini expressed that while Rogers Arena is ready for basketball, having the NBA in Vancouver <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> market support, which his company assesses to see if it has improved since the Grizzlies left.|$|E

5|$|Mulder {{believes}} that the entity travels from victim to victim like a contagion. At his request, Scully performs an autopsy on Chantara's body at the morgue. During the procedure, a conversation between Scully and the coroner's assistant (Tara Karsian) causes the latter to panic about a Hantavirus outbreak. The entity suddenly kills her with the disease. When Mulder discusses the death with Scully, he realizes that Wetzel {{is in danger of}} being revisited by the entity. The agents and police return to the crack house, where the entity has trapped an injured Wetzel in an upstairs room. The agents are unable to enter the room until dawn comes, when the entity disappears and spares Wetzel's life. After the incident is over, Scully expresses her sympathies to Mulder that being filmed by a national television crew did not provide the public exposure to paranormal phenomena that he had hoped. However, Mulder remains hopeful, noting that it all <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> how the production crew edits the footage together.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} and final day, Bhuvan passes his century, while most of the later wickets fall. Ismail returns to bat {{with the help of a}} runner and passes his half-century, {{reducing}} the required runs to an attainable total. The game <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the last over with Kachra on strike. With one ball remaining and the team down five runs, Kachra knocks the ball a short distance, managing a single. However, the umpire signals no ball. Bhuvan returns to bat and swings extremely hard at the next ball, hitting the ball high in the air towards the boundary. Russell backpedals and catches it, gleefully believing that the British team has won — until he realises that he has caught the ball beyond the boundary, giving six runs, and therefore victory, to Bhuvan's team. Even as they celebrate the victory, the drought ends as a rainstorm erupts.|$|E

25|$|When the {{glucose level}} <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the usual {{physiologic}} value, insulin {{release from the}} β-cells slows or stops. If the blood glucose level drops lower than this, especially to dangerously low levels, release of hyperglycemic hormones (most prominently glucagon from islet of Langerhans alpha cells) forces release of glucose into the blood from the liver glycogen stores, supplemented by gluconeogenesis if the glycogen stores become depleted. By increasing blood glucose, the hyperglycemic hormones prevent or correct life-threatening hypoglycemia.|$|E
25|$|This final {{critique}} of writing {{with which the}} dialogue concludes {{seems to be one}} of the more interesting facets of the conversation for those who seek to interpret Plato in general; Plato, of course, <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> us through his numerous written works, and philosophy today is concerned almost purely with the reading and writing of written texts. It seems proper to recall that Plato's ever-present protagonist and ideal man, Socrates, fits Plato's description of the dialectician perfectly, and never wrote a thing.|$|E
25|$|In the endgame, it <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a race {{over who}} can checkmate the {{opponent}} first. A tactic known as speed counting {{plays an important}} role in the endgame. By counting the number of moves until checkmate (assuming the opponent doesn't get to move) for both Black and White, this will help to influence decisions on whether to attack or defend. A simple mistake can change the flow of the game drastically. Among this, there are many other delicate factors to look out for within the endgame, including sacrificial attacks and traps.|$|E

25|$|The anti-climatic {{nature of}} the eighth-century Irish tale then gains {{significant}} clarity {{in the light of}} the relationship between a horned or antler-bearing deity, warrior, or progenitor, and the chthonic dwelling, treasure-guarding serpent that encircled the waist of the one it chose to protect. This universal Celtic concept <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> us as a mere echo of its ancient self through centuries of the Christianization of Ireland. The Gaelic Cernunnos may now possibly only be found in the slight similarity of a name and the peculiarity of a single passage from a Middle Ages Irish epic.|$|E
25|$|The EPR paradox {{refers to}} a famous thought {{experiment}} of Einstein, Podolski and Rosen that was realized experimentally {{for the first time}} by Alain Aspect in 1981 and 1982 in the Aspect experiment. In this experiment, the measurement of the state of one of the quantum systems of an entangled pair apparently instantaneously forces the other system (which may be distant) to be measured in the complementary state. However, no information can be transmitted this way; the answer {{to whether or not the}} measurement actually affects the other quantum system <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> which interpretation of quantum mechanics one subscribes to.|$|E
25|$|Units {{that can}} attack, do so either {{directly}} (can attack adjacent to another unit where standing or moved, but be counter-attacked {{by the enemy}} unit), or in-directly (must remain still to attack, and have an enemy in firing range). The amount of damage done by a unit to an enemy unit in combat, <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a number of factors: the number of hit points the attacker has, whether they can use their main weapon (if not, they either cannot, or will use their secondary weapon instead), the type of unit the attacker and the defender are, and the terrain the enemy unit is on; by contrast, if the enemy unit is directly attacked, the same factors determine the damage done when they counter-attack the attacking unit. The majority of units have main weapons with a limited supply of ammunition, {{with the amount of}} ammo {{depending on the type of}} unit. Units with secondary weapons will resort to these when their primary weapon's ammunition runs out, until they are resupplied.|$|E
