5|$|Britain's {{earliest}} (excavated) windmill is in Great Linford. The large oak beams {{forming the}} base supports still survived in the mill mound and were shown by radio carbon dating to {{originate in the}} first half of the 13th century. (The present stone tower mill at Bradwell was built in 1815, on a site <b>convenient</b> <b>to</b> the new Grand Junction Canal).|$|E

5|$|Above {{the layer}} of {{metallic}} hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, the pressure and temperature are above hydrogen's critical pressure of 1.2858 MPa and critical temperature of only 32.938K. In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases—hydrogen {{is said to be}} in a supercritical fluid state. It is <b>convenient</b> <b>to</b> treat hydrogen as gas in the upper layer extending downward from the cloud layer to a depth of about 1,000km, and as liquid in deeper layers. Physically, there is no clear boundary—the gas smoothly becomes hotter and denser as one descends.|$|E
5|$|It is most <b>convenient</b> <b>to</b> {{compare the}} various local weight {{standards}} by the metric weights of their ounces. The actual mass of an ounce varied by ±17% (5g) around the typical value of 30g. The table only shows approximate {{values for the}} most important standards; even the same nominal standard could vary slightly between one city and its neighbour. The range from 25g to 31g is filled with numerous variants, especially the Italian range up to 28g. But there is a relatively large gap between the troy ounces of 31g and the Habsburg ounce of 35g. The latter {{is the product of}} an 18th-century weight reform.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Norwich {{railway station}} had opened in 1844. Although many Norwich {{residents}} {{were reluctant to}} use the railway, and goods carriers initially found it more <b>convenient</b> <b>to</b> continue to collect goods from the coaching inns, as railway usage gradually {{increased the number of}} coaches and carts calling at the inns slowly dwindled, reducing congestion. In 1899 the Angel inn—renamed the Royal Hotel in 1840 on the occasion of Queen Victoria's wedding—finally closed, and was replaced with George Skipper's Royal Arcade, a shopping centre in the Art Nouveau style.|$|E

5|$|Medicinal {{plants are}} often tough and fibrous, {{requiring}} {{some form of}} preparation to make them <b>convenient</b> <b>to</b> administer. According to the Institute for Traditional Medicine, common methods for the preparation of herbal medicines include decoction, powdering, and extraction with alcohol, in each case yielding a mixture of substances. Decoction involves crushing and then boiling the plant material in water to produce a liquid extract. Powdering involves drying the plant material and then crushing it to yield a powder that can be compressed into tablets. Alcohol extraction involves soaking the plant material in cold wine or distilled spirit to form a tincture.|$|E
5|$|The Irish played yearly {{first-class}} matches {{with the}} Scots, only interrupted by world wars, until 1999, but all their other cricket depended upon touring international sides finding it <b>convenient</b> <b>to</b> include {{a visit to}} Ireland in their schedules. However, Ireland sometimes surprised Test nations on these occasions, beating the West Indies by 60 runs in a three-day match in Dublin in 1928, for example; it was Ireland's first match against the West Indies. In 1969, in a match played at Sion Mills in County Tyrone, the team defeated a West Indian side including Clive Lloyd and Clyde Walcott by nine wickets, after bowling them out for 25. This {{was the last time}} Ireland defeated a touring side until 2003, when they beat Zimbabwe by ten wickets.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{conceptual}} clarity of this Feynman approach to QED, almost no early textbooks follow {{him in their}} presentation. When performing calculations {{it is much easier}} to work with the Fourier transforms of the propagators. Experimental tests of quantum electrodynamics are typically scattering experiments. In scattering theory, particles' momenta rather than their positions are considered, and it is <b>convenient</b> <b>to</b> think of particles as being created or annihilated when they interact. Feynman diagrams then look the same, but the lines have different interpretations. The electron line represents an electron with a given energy and momentum, with a similar interpretation of the photon line. A vertex diagram represents the annihilation of one electron and the creation of another together with the absorption or creation of a photon, each having specified energies and momenta.|$|E

5|$|During the {{production}} of Paths of Glory in Munich in early 1957, Kubrick met and romanced the German actress Christiane Harlan, who played a small though memorable role in the film. Kubrick married Harlan in 1958, and the couple remained together 40 years, {{until his death in}} 1999. Besides his stepdaughter, they had two daughters together: Anya Renata (April 6, 1959 – July 7, 2009) and Vivian Vanessa (born August 5, 1960). In 1959 they settled into a home at 316 South Camden Drive in Beverly Hills with Harlan's daughter, Katherina, aged six. They also lived in New York, during which time Christiane studied art at the Art Students League of New York, later becoming an independent artist. The couple moved to the United Kingdom in 1961 to make Lolita, and Kubrick hired Peter Sellers to star in his next film, Dr. Strangelove, Sellers was unable to leave the UK, so Kubrick made Britain his permanent home thereafter. The move was quite <b>convenient</b> <b>to</b> Kubrick, since he shunned the Hollywood system and its publicity machine, and he and Christiane had become alarmed with the increase in violence in New York.|$|E
5|$|Italy's {{position}} in {{the centre of the}} Mediterranean made it unacceptably hazardous to send ships from Britain to Egypt via that route, so British reinforcements and supplies for the area had to travel around the Cape of Good Hope. For this reason, it was more <b>convenient</b> <b>to</b> reinforce General Sir Archibald Wavell's Middle East Command with troops from Australia, New Zealand and India. Nonetheless, even when Britain was threatened with invasion after the Battle of France and equipment was urgently required to re-equip the British Expeditionary Force after its losses in the Dunkirk evacuation, troops and supplies were still despatched to the Middle East Command. A convoy that departed the United Kingdom in August 1940 brought guns, stores, ammunition, and three armoured regiments, including the 7th Royal Tank Regiment, equipped with Matilda II tanks.|$|E
5|$|The {{precious}} metal composition of US coins was calculated such that gold would be fifteen times as valuable per ounce as silver. By {{the turn of}} the 19th century, the price of gold in terms of silver had risen to approximately 15.75 to one. This made it profitable for merchants to buy gold coins at face value using silver coins, and export the gold to Europe. Gold vanished from circulation in the United States by 1800. By 1801, almost no bullion was being deposited at the Mint, causing the Jefferson administration to consider its closure. The eagle was especially desired by exporters, as the larger size and value made it more <b>convenient</b> <b>to</b> handle. Although the Mint remained open, on December 31, 1804, President Thomas Jefferson ordered that eagles and silver dollars no longer be struck, ending the Turban Head eagle series. Coin dealer and author Q. David Bowers suggests that while a majority of eagles remained in the United States, enough were exported to make continuing their mintage an exercise in futility.|$|E
