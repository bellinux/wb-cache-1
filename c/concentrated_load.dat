40|$|A common {{difficulty}} {{in the analysis}} and design of transmission and distribution lines is to determine a conductor’s tension and its static profile under <b>concentrated</b> <b>loads.</b> For relatively small <b>concentrated</b> <b>loads</b> (such as detuning pendulums on transmission lines), approximation methods may give good predictions.

This paper presents methodologies to compute conductor tension and static profile in three dimensional space using both approximate and exact solution procedures under con-centrated loads with different boundary conditions.
