40|$|Until now, the {{automated}} material processes used to manufacture large, composite aerospace structures have been filament winding, automated tape layup, and fiber placement. An {{overview of the}} advancements in braided preform architectures and braiding machinery identify braiding as an attractive process alternative for composite manufacturers. State-of-the-art braiding equipment incorporates fully automated control over all braiding parameters, including translational and rotational control of the mandrel, a vision system for real-time inspection, a laser projection system and integrated <b>circumferential</b> <b>winding.</b> These technological advancements, {{in addition to the}} high rate of material deposition found with braiding approach the precision demonstrated by fiber placement systems and the cost efficiency found in filament winding and is applicable to the manufacture of large scale, structural preforms...|$|E
40|$|We {{synthesized}} a pentamine (3 - 3 - 3 - 3) and two hexamine (3 - 3 - 3 - 3 - 3 and 3 - 4 - 3 - 4 - 3) analogues of {{the natural}} polyamine, spermine (3 - 4 - 3) and studied their effectiveness in condensing pGL 3 plasmid DNA, using light scattering and atomic force microscopic (AFM) techniques. The midpoint concentration of the polyamines on pGL 3 condensation (EC 50) was 11. 3, 10. 6, 1. 5, 0. 49 and 0. 52 µM, respectively, for 3 - 4 - 3, norspermine (3 - 3 - 3), 3 - 3 - 3 - 3, 3 - 3 - 3 - 3 - 3 and 3 - 4 - 3 - 4 - 3 in 10 mM Na cacodylate buffer. Dynamic laser light scattering study showed a decrease in hydrodynamic radii of plasmid DNA particles {{as the number of}} positive charges on the polyamines increased. AFM data showed the presence of toroids with outer diameter of 117 – 191 nm for different polyamines, and a mean height of 2. 61 ± 0. 77 nm. AFM results also revealed the presence of intermediate structures, including those showing <b>circumferential</b> <b>winding</b> of DNA to toroids. The dependence of the EC 50 on Na+ concentration suggests different modes of binding of spermine and its higher valent analogues with DNA. Our results show a 20 -fold increase in the efficacy of hexamines for DNA condensation compared to spermine, and provide new insights into the mechanism(s) of DNA nanoparticle formation. These studies might help to develop novel nonviral gene delivery vehicles...|$|E
