40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} recent {{literature}} on the endogenous formation of economic coalitions, in particular, the partition function literature that allows for externalities across coalitions. Various economic coalitions are classified either as <b>coalitions</b> <b>with</b> positive externalities (output cartels, R&D <b>coalitions</b> <b>with</b> spillovers, public-goods (environmental) coalitions, free-trade areas) or as <b>coalitions</b> <b>with</b> negative externalities (joint ventures with efficiency gains, customs unions). I review several games of coalition formation (the Single Coalition Formation game, the Open Membership game, the Exclusive Membership game, the Coalition Unanimity game, the Equilibrium Binding Agreements game) and examine equilibrium coalition structures in these games...|$|R

50|$|Male Barbary macaques {{interfere}} in conflicts and form <b>coalitions</b> <b>with</b> other males, usually with related males {{rather than with}} unrelated males. These relationships suggest that males do {{so in order to}} indirectly increase their own fitness. Furthermore, males form <b>coalitions</b> <b>with</b> closely related kin more often than they do with distantly related kin. These coalitions are not permanent and may change frequently as male ranking within the group changes. Although males are more likely to form <b>coalitions</b> <b>with</b> males who have helped them in the past, this is not as important as relatedness in determining coalitions. Males avoid conflicting with higher ranking males and will more frequently form <b>coalitions</b> <b>with</b> the higher ranking male in a conflict. Close grouping of males occur when infant Barbary macaques are present. Interactions between males are commonly initiated when a male presents an infant macaque to an adult male who is not caring for an infant, or when an unattached male approaches males who are caring for infants. This behaviour leads to a type of social buffering, which reduces the number of antagonistic interactions among males in a group.|$|R

5|$|During {{the revolt}} many {{attempts}} were made to form an anti-Ottoman coalition including the Holy Roman Empire. Pope Eugene IV requested troops to be sent to assist the revolt and tried to gather funds. In 1435, Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg sent Fruzhin, a Bulgarian nobleman, and in early 1436 Daud, a pretender to the Ottoman throne, to negotiate the possibility of a <b>coalition</b> <b>with</b> the rebels. However, by mid-1436 a large force under Turahan Bey had been assembled. Despite the military victories the rebel leaders acted autonomously without a central leadership, the lack of which contributed greatly to their final defeat. Turahan's forces eventually subdued the revolt and marched through Albania, committing widespread massacres of civilians.|$|E

The ZNP entered into a <b>coalition</b> <b>with</b> the Zanzibar and Pemba People's Party (ZPPP) and this time took 13 seats, while the ASP, despite receiving the most votes, won just 10. Electoral fraud was suspected by the ASP and civil disorder broke out, resulting in 68 deaths. To maintain control, the coalition government banned the more radical opposition parties, filled the civil service with its own appointees, and politicised the police.|$|E
