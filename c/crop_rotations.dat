40|$|Abstract—In a {{long-term}} experiment established in early 1990, {{the effects of}} <b>crop</b> <b>rotation</b> and mineral fertilizers were studied on the maize (Zea mays L.) yield and soil fertility.

However, the yield-increasing effect of rotation was diminished with balanced nutrient supply, especially for N.
