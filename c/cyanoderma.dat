40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{a case of}} acute superior vena cava syndrome during percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), and to review the associated clinical features, management and complications. Clinical features: A 34 -year-old man, diagnosed as right renal calculi and nodal tachycardia, was admitted to receive percutaneous nephroscope laser lithotripsy. Shortly after stone disintegration, he suffered acute hypoxic and hypotension, and showed <b>cyanoderma</b> of face and chest skin, ocular proptosis, jugular filling and ventricular fibrillation. Dopamine and adrenaline was intravenously injected. The patient {{was turned over to}} supine position and external cardiac massage and electric defibrillation were carried out immediately. The patient finally cardioverted. His vital signs subsequently became stable and <b>cyanoderma</b> faded. The patient was eventually discharged from the intensive care unit three days following the event. Conclusion: Severe complications such as cardiac arrest could happen during PCNL. Close monitoring the vital signs is essential for early finding and quick response to rescue...|$|E
40|$|Background: In April 2013, a {{hospital}} in Suzhou City notified authorities of a patient with nitrite poisoning with two other family members who had similar toxic symptoms five days prior. We investigated the event to identify the cause, source and possible route of contamination. Methods: A case was defined as any person living in the Yang Shan Hua Yuan community who {{had been diagnosed with}} <b>cyanoderma</b> and food poisoning symptoms from 15 to 25 April 2013. Active case finding was conducted by interviewing community residents and reviewing medical records from local clinics; information was then retrospectively collected on the patient’s food history, cooking procedures and food sources. Results: We identified three nitrite poisoning cases, one male and two females, from the same family. The time between dinner and onset of illness was less than an a hour. A retrospective survey showed that a substance presumed to be sugar mixed with asparagus on 17 April and with stir-fried asparagus on 21 April wasthe suspected contaminant. The presumed sugar came from a clean-up of a neighbouring rental house. Nitrite was detected in a vomitus sample, the sugar substance and two leftover food samples. Conclusion: This family cluster of nitrite poisoning resulted from the mistaken use of nitrite as sugar to cook dishes. We recommend that sodium nitrite be dyed a bright colour to prevent such a mistake and that health departments strengthen food hygiene education to alert people about the danger of eating unidentified food from an unknown source...|$|E
40|$|Tropical rainforests are {{considered}} as hotspots for bird diversity, yet {{little is known}} about the system that upholds the coexistence of species. Differences in body size that are associated with foraging strategies and spatial distribution are believed to promote the coexistence of closely related species by reducing competition. However, the fact that many babbler species do not differ significantly in their morphology has challenged this view. We studied the foraging ecology of nine sympatric babbler species (i. e., Pellorneum capistratum, P. bicolor, P. malaccense, Malacopteron cinereum, M. magnum, Stachyris nigriceps, S. nigricollis, S. maculata, and <b>Cyanoderma</b> erythropterum) in the Krau Wildlife Reserve in Peninsular Malaysia. We investigated; i) how these babblers forage in the wild and use vegetation to obtain food, and ii) how these trophically similar species differ in spatial distribution and foraging tactics. Results indicated that most babblers foraged predominantly on aerial leaf litter and used gleaning manoeuvre in intermediate-density foliage but exhibited wide ranges of vertical strata usage, thus reducing interspecific competition. The principal component analysis indicated that two components, i. e., foraging height and substrate are important as mechanisms to allow the coexistence of sympatric babblers. The present findings revealed that these bird species have unique foraging niches that are distinct from each other, and this may apply to other insectivorous birds inhabiting tropical forests. This suggests that niche separation does occur among coexisting birds, thus following Gause' law of competitive exclusion, which states two species occupying the same niche will not stably coexist...|$|E
