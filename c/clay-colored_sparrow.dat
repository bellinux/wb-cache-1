40|$|Accurate {{estimates}} of fledging age {{are needed in}} field studies to avoid inducing premature fledging or missing the fledging event. Both may lead to misinterpretation of nest fate. Correctly assessing nest fate and length of the nestling period can be critical for accurate calculation of nest survival rates. For researchers who mark nestlings, knowing {{the age at which}} their activities may cause young to leave nests prematurely could prevent introducing bias to their studies. We estimated fledging ages from grassland passerine nests monitored from hatching through fledging with miniature video cameras in North Dakota and Minnesota during 1996 - 2001. We compared these values to those obtained from traditional nest visits and from the literature. Mean and modal fledging ages for video-monitored nests were generally similar to those for visited nests, although <b>Clay-colored</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (Spizella pallida) typically fledged 1 day earlier from visited nests. Average fledging ages from both video and nest visits occurred within ranges reported in the literature, but expanded by 1 - 2 days the upper age limit for <b>Clay-colored</b> <b>Sparrows</b> and the lower age limit for Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus). Video showed that eggs hatched throughout the day, whereas most young fledged in the morning (06 : 30 - 12 : 30 CDT). Length of the hatching period for a clutch was usually 3 ̆e 1 day and was positively correlated with clutch size. Length of the fledging period for a brood was usually 3 ̆c 1 day, and in nearly half the nests fledging was completed within 3 ̆c 2 hr. Video surveillance was a useful tool for obtaining new information and for corroborating published statements related to hatching and fledging chronology.

40|$|Cumnt {{management}} {{recommendations for}} grassland birds in North America emphasize providing large patches of grassland habitat within landscapes that have few forest or shrubland areas. These Bird Conservation Areas are being proposed {{under the assumption}} that large patches of habitat in treeless landscapes will maintain viable populations of grassland birds. This assumption requires that patch size and landscape features affect density and nesting success of grassland birds, and that these effects are consistent among years and regions and across focal species. However, these assumptions have not yet been validated for grassland binls, and the relative importance of local vegetation structure, patch size, and landscape composition on grassland bird populations is not well known. In addition, factors influencing grassland bird nesting success have been investigated mostly in small-scale and short-duration studies. To develop management guidelines for grassland birds, we tested the spatial and temporal repeatability of the influence of patch size and landscape composition on density and nesting success of 3 grassland passerines, after controlling for local-scale vegetation structure, climate, and- when analyzing nest successbird density. We conducted our study during 4 years (1998 - 2001) in 44 study plots that were set up in 3 regions of the northern tallgrass prairie in Minnesota and North Dakota, USA. In these study plots we measured density and nesting success of <b>clay-colored</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Spizella pallida), Savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), and bobolinks (Dolichonyx olyzivorus). Statistical models indicated that density was influenced by patch size, landscape, region, and local vegetation structure more so than by local vegetation structure alone. Both magnitude and direction of the response of density to patch size varied among regions, years, and species. In contrast, the direction of landscape effects was consistent among regions, years, and between Savannah sparrows and bobolinks. In each species, this landscape effect was independent of patch size. Nesting success was not cleariy influenced by patch size or landscape composition, and none of the factors that influenced avian density also influenced nesting success in any of the 3 species. General statements on 2 ̆ 2 optimal habitat 2 ̆ 2 for grassland birds should therefore be viewed cautiously.

40|$|Two {{hundred years}} ago this May, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, {{together}} with the three dozen army volunteers and hired hunter-interpreters who made up the Corps of Discovery, departed their winter camp {{at the mouth of}} the Missouri River, north of St. Louis, Missouri, and set out to make history. President Thomas Jefferson had charged them with the monumental task of exploring the unknown lands of the Louisiana Territory, purchased from France the year before, and trying to find a navigable route to the Pacific Ocean via the Missouri River. The explorers were also asked to make extensive geological, geographic, anthropological, and biological observations. Their biological duties included the collection of both plant and animal materials, with special consideration to the discovery of possibly medicinally important plants and economically valuable animals. After breaking winter camp, the group took five weeks to travel 300 miles to the mouth of the Kansas River, the future site of Kansas City. By then, they were in true wilderness and began to see many unfamiliar birds and mammals. Through the summer they gradually worked northward, and in late October they reached what is now western North Dakota. There they built Fort Mandan and prepared to endure a long winter prior to heading farther upstream, and farther west, in 1805. The five-month, 2, 000 -mile trip made by the Corps of Discovery in 1804 can now be made in a car in only a few days. Very few stretches of the middle Missouri River even remotely approach the ecological conditions that it exhibited two centuries ago, yet nearly all the birds and mammals that Lewis and Clark documented in 1804 still exist. The Carolina Parakeet and the Passenger Pigeon, seen later during the expedition in present-day Montana but now extinct, are the sad exceptions.

40|$|The {{structure}} of vegetation in grassland systems, unlike that in forest systems, varies dramatically among {{years on the}} same sites, and among regions with similar vegetation. The role of this variation in vegetation structure on bird density and nesting success of grassland birds is poorly understood, primarily because few studies have included sufficiently large temporal and spatial scales to capture the variation in vegetation structure, bird density, or nesting success. To date, no large-scale study on grassland birds has been conducted to investigate whether grassland bird density and nesting success respond similarly to changes in vegetation structure. However, reliable management recommendations require investigations into the distribution and nesting success of grassland birds over larger temporal and spatial scales. In addition, studies need to examine whether bird density and nesting success respond similarly to changing environmental conditions. We investigated the effect of vegetation structure on the density and nesting success of 3 grassland-nesting birds: <b>clay-colored</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Spizella pallida), Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), and bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) in 3 regions of the northern tallgrass prairie in 1998 - 2001.

We could identify only 1 variable that clearly influenced nesting success of 1 species: <b>clay-colored</b> <b>sparrow</b> nesting success increased with increasing percentage of nest cover from the surrounding vegetation. Because responses of avian density and nesting success to vegetation measures varied among regions, years, and species, land managers at all times need to provide grasslands with different types of vegetation structure.

40|$|In 1998 we {{initiated}} {{a test of}} the concept that Bird Conservation Areas (BCA 2 ̆ 7 s) can maintain populations of breeding grassland birds. The underlying hypothesis is that large core areas of quality habitat (such as native prairie) that are surrounded by neutral habitats (such as small-grain fields), and that are isolated from hostile habitats (such as woody vegetation) will result in avian densities and reproductive rates sufficient to at least maintain population levels of breeding birds. This concept was proposed by the Midwest Working Group of Partners In Flight (e. g., Pashley and Fitzgerald 1996) and endorsed also by the Prairie Pothole Joint Venture of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. This evaluation is being conducted in the northern tallgrass prairie, but the concept may be more generally applicable. In 1999, we added 11 study plots in Sheyenne National Grassland in southeastern North Dakota to the existing 33 study plots in northwestern Minnesota. All study plots were assigned to one of four categories: 1) small core area surrounded by neutral landscape, 2) small core area surrounded by hostile landscape, 3) large core area surrounded by neutral landscape, and 4) large core area surrounded by hostile landscape. This year, four of the study plots could not be censused or nest-searched because prairies received prescribed burning. On each of the remaining 40 study plots we collected data on population density of breeding birds by censusing each plot twice during the field season.

Comparisons of nesting parameters among grassland species will help identify important management considerations. We describe and compare nest-site characteristics, nesting phenology, clutch size, hatching and fledging success, and brood parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) for three grassland passerine species nesting in tallgrass prairie of northwestern Minnesota and southeastern North Dakota.

These species differed in many aspects of their breeding ecology. Clay-colored and Savannah sparrows initiated their nests almost 2 weeks earlier than Bobolinks, with peak nesting occurring in June. Clutch size was lower (3. 77 ± 0. 03 SE) for Clay- colored Sparrows than Savannah Sparrows (4. 13 ± 0. 05) and Bobolinks (5. 25 ± 0. 08). The number of host eggs hatched per nest was higher in Bobolinks (3. 46 ± 0. 20) than in Clay-colored Sparrows (2. 52 ± 0. 09) and Savannah Sparrows (2. 41 ± 0. 11), {{but the number of}} young fledged per Bobolink nest (1. 97) was similar to that of Savannah Sparrows (2. 01). Clay-colored Sparrows fledged only 1. 35 host young per nest. Mayfield nest success was higher for Savannah Sparrows (31. 4 %) than for Clay-colored Sparrows (27. 4 %) or Bobolinks (20. 7 %). The main cause of nest failure was nest predation: predation in Clay-colored Sparrows (47. 9 %) was higher than in Savannah Sparrows (33. 5 %) but similar to Bobolinks (41. 8 %). Brood parasitism was lower in Clay-colored Sparrows (5. 1 %) than in Bobolinks (10. 8 %), and intermediate (6. 7 %) in Savannah Sparrows.

Species of interest to The Nature Conservancy (Ewert 1999) that were found in the inventory included the following: primary focus species included Peregrine Falcon (1 occasional individual), Bald Eagle (frequently observed, one possible nesting pair in Jay Cooke State Park), Sedge Wren (15), Wood Thrush (2), and Black-and-White Warbler (16). Secondary focus species of interest that were observed include Wood Duck (5), Black-billed Cuckoo (3), Belted Kingfisher (7), Eastern Wood Pewee (14), Least Flycatcher (25), Marsh Wren (18), Veery (72), Brown Thrasher (3), Warbling Vireo (12), Chestnut-sided Warbler (26), Black-throated Green Warbler (14), Mourning Warbler (16), Rose-breasted Grosbeak (8), <b>Clay-colored</b> <b>Sparrow</b> (11), Baltimore Oriole (1), and Purple Finch (1). The following species of primary focus have historically been found in the area, but none were observed in 1999 : American Bittern, Piping Plover, and Black Tern. Of the primary focus species, the Sedge Wren is found in highest densities in the sedge/grass wetlands in Allouez Bay, the Oliver Bridge area, and at Boy Scout Landing. These areas, along with Spirit and Mud Lake would also provide potentially excellent habitat for American Bittern and, especially Allouez Bay, for the Black Tern where the species has historically nested. The primary focus species associated with forests were found in highest abundance in the forested regions on the Wisconsin side of the St. Louis River system and in scattered locations in Fond du Lac. High relative abundance for many of these species would also be found in the Jay Cooke State Park area which was not sampled because of the limited time and it is already a protected area. For the secondary focus species, the Marsh Wren was found in highest abundance in the Spirit and Mud Lake areas where extensive patches of cattail wetlands are found. The forest associated species that were identified as secondary focus species were also found most abundantly in the forested regions on the Wi~consin side of the river, Fond du Lac, and they would also be found commonly at Jay Cooke State Park. Clay-colored Sparrows were found commonly in the brush/grass open areas on the Wisconsin side of the river where the Bong Bridge enters Superior...|$|E
40|$|I {{estimate}} that 215 bird species currently breed or have previously bred in Nebraska. This number compares {{with a total}} of 330 species that breed or have bred in the Great Plains region south of Canada, as I defined that region in my book on the breeding birds of the Great Plains (Johnsgard, 1979). Grasslands or potential grasslands make up about 81 percent of the Great Plains 2 ̆ 7 vegetation, and probably represented about 96 percent of Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s original vegetation. Only in the Sandhills region is that vegetation type still essentially intact; the tall-grass prairie of eastern Nebraska is Virtually gone. In my 1979 summary, I judged that 36 species of Great Plain 2 ̆ 7 s bird are grassland-adapted forms, with 15 of these endemic to the Great Plains, and the rest more broadly distributed. Nine of these endemics breed in Nebraska (Greater Prairie-Chicken, Mountain Plover, Long-billed Curlew, Upland Sandpiper, Dickcissel, Lark Bunting, <b>Clay-colored</b> <b>Sparrow,</b> Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow, McCown 2 ̆ 7 s Longspur and Chestnut-collared Longspur), and the Chihuahuan Raven also once did. None of these ten species is considered endangered nationally, although the Greater Prairie-Chicken needs to be monitored closely. Birds of the tall-grass prairie that currently breed in eastern Nebraska include the Upland Sandpiper, Dickcissel. Eastern Meadowlark, Field Sparrow and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow. Both of the latter are not, strictly speaking, prairie species, but either represent a later successional stage containing some small trees (Field Sparrow), or the presence some brushy or weedy elements (Henslow 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow). In the west the short-grass plains support several declining or rare species, including Ferruginous Hawk, Swainson 2 ̆ 7 s Hawk, Prairie Falcon, Mountain Plover, Burrowing Owl, Common Poor-will, Lark Bunting, and two longspurs. Some of these also have certain additional non-vegetative needs such as cliff-side nest sites (Prairie Falcon), burrows (Burrowing Owl), nearly bare ground (Mountain Plover), or rocky substrates (Poor-will). The geographically and ecologically intermediate Sandhills prairies support many typical grassland and wet meadow breeders, such as Sharp-tailed Grouse, Long-billed Curlew, Bobolink, Lark Sparrow, Grasshopper Sparrow and Horned Lark. Woodlands and forests comprise about 15 percent of the native vegetation of the Great Plains states, and support some 51 percent of the region 2 ̆ 7 s breeding avifauna (Johnsgard, 1979). I {{estimate that}} in Nebraska this vegetation type occupies three percent of the state 2 ̆ 7 s surface area, and supports 48 percent of its avifauna. It is thus {{one of the most important}} vegetation types for generating species diversity of our avifauna. Bald Eagles are among the rare woodland-nesting species of Nebraska, although they are also strongly water-dependent for food. Several hawks (Broad-winged, Red-shouldered, Cooper 2 ̆ 7 s, etc.) are other clear associates of mature woodlands. Several woodland nesting passerines that have generally large ranges elsewhere in the central or western states are limited to woodlands in extreme northwestern Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s Pine Ridge region, or in the lower Missouri woodlands of extreme southeastern Nebraska (see Table 2) ...|$|E
