25|$|After {{being called}} Kid Apocalypse by Kid Omega, Evan begins {{learning}} about Apocalypse and is saddened {{that he himself}} looks like the villain, raising {{the possibility of a}} future that Evan rejects. After saving Angel and discovering that he possesses the ability to see the essence of those he looks upon, Evan asks him to tell him what he sees when he looks at him. Angel tells En he sees only goodness inside him, which makes Evan happy, so he thanks Angel for being a good friend. In fact, Angel lied, as the only thing he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> dark image of Apocalypse.|$|E
60|$|The {{speaker was}} a grizzled man, middle-aged, and rather too plump for a sailor. He had a genial, good-natured countenance, {{and so far}} as I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only {{occupant}} of the vessel.|$|E
60|$|Fred and Randy {{walked on}} ahead, trying to {{determine}} where the road led to. But all they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> blackness of the forest, and the roadway seemed to grow rougher and more perilous at every step.|$|E
60|$|Without ado {{the lady}} of the ranch marched into the kitchen, {{followed}} by Mrs. Rover. All <b>the</b> ladies <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> freshly-caught fish resting on the cabinet shelf and the floor.|$|R
50|$|The {{track of}} totality passed across the North Atlantic {{and into the}} Arctic Ocean. The only {{populated}} places from which <b>the</b> totality <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> Faroe Islands and Svalbard.|$|R
6000|$|The busy hands {{stopped working}} there, for Nat held them fast in his, {{and all her}} downcast eyes <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> gay flowers her needle wrought, {{agitated}} by the beating of the man's heart underneath. Her color deepened beautifully and her lips trembled, {{in spite of the}} arch smile they wore, as she said half-tenderly, half-wilfully,-- ...|$|R
60|$|The {{thing was}} exasperating--it was absurd. Here {{we were just}} arrived upon the moon, amidst we knew not what wonders, and all we <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> gray and {{streaming}} wall of the bubble in which we had come.|$|E
60|$|The skipper's {{daughter}} was standing beside him, looking down commiseratingly. Of {{the rest of}} the family all he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> broad blue seats of their trousers as they leaned hopefully over the side in the quest for wealth.|$|E
60|$|I {{went into}} my room and drew the curtains, {{but there was little}} to notice. My window opened into the courtyard, all I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> warm grey of {{quickening}} sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have written of this day.|$|E

50|$|From Mount Hureish, Mount Ebal <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> to <b>the</b> {{south and}} the Wadi Ara plain <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> to <b>the</b> northwest. At its western foot <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Palestinian village of Jaba', and Meithalun and Siris <b>are</b> <b>the</b> closest villages to the east.|$|R
60|$|I went outside, {{not knowing}} whether {{to be angry}} or amused with these queer people. In the broad light of day Holston looked {{as bad as it}} had made me feel by night. All I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> station and freight-sheds, several stores with high, wide signs, glaringly painted, and a long block of saloons. When I had turned a street corner, however, a number of stores came into view with some three-storied brick buildings, and, farther out, many frame houses.|$|R
60|$|Weak from terror, Rokoff sank shuddering {{into the}} bottom of the dugout. For a moment he could not realize the good fortune that had befallen him--all that he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> figure of a silent, {{struggling}} white man disappearing beneath the surface of the river to unthinkable death in the slimy mud of the bottom.|$|E
60|$|Pretty {{soon they}} came to a nice mossy green log right across the Lone Little Path. Peter Rabbit stopped and sat up very {{straight}}. He looked this way and looked that way. Johnny Chuck stopped too and he sat up very straight and looked this way and looked that way, but all he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> mossy green log across the Lone Little Path.|$|E
60|$|Peter Rabbit {{left the}} Lone Little Path across the Green Meadows for some secret little paths of his own. His long legs took {{him over the}} ground very fast. Johnny Chuck, running behind him, grew tired and hot, for Johnny's legs are short and he is fat and roly-poly. At times all he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> white patch on the seat of Peter Rabbit's pants. He began to wish that he had minded old Mrs. Chuck and stayed at home. It {{was too late to}} go back now, for he didn't know the way.|$|E
50|$|People either loved or {{hated the}} film. It either won first place at festivals {{or did not}} make the cut. Standing in the back of at the first screening, they heard {{laughter}} and when the lights went up, intense conversations. Like filmmakers everywhere all they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> little things they wished they’d done differently. But as the film made the festival circuit, it became clear that audiences were enchanted by Karl. He was an authentic American character. If the film preserves the memory of Karl, it’s done its best.|$|R
60|$|Not a hansom did I {{meet with}} {{in all my}} drive, while mine was like an {{apparition}} from another and better world, the way the children ran after it and alongside. And as far as I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> solid walls of brick, the slimy pavements, and the screaming streets; {{and for the first}} time in my life the fear of the crowd smote me. It <b>was</b> like <b>the</b> fear of the sea; and the miserable multitudes, street upon street, seemed so many waves of a vast and malodorous sea, lapping about me and threatening to well up and over me.|$|R

60|$|Derek {{had not the}} {{privilege}} {{of being able to}} read Jill's thoughts. All he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> outer Jill, and the outer Jill, as she had always done, was stirring his emotions. Her daintiness afflicted him. Not for the first, the second, or the third time since they had come into each other's lives, he was astounded at the strength of the appeal which Jill had for him when they were together, as contrasted with its weakness when they were apart. He made another attempt to establish the scene on a loftier plane.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is wonderful," [...] she declared. [...] "I read {{everything}} in the papers about you--and I get the monthly reports, for of course I am a subscriber--so is mother. But--that brings your shameful neglect of us back into my mind. I wrote to you begging {{to be allowed to}} inspect one of your branches, and all I got back was a polite reply from your secretary to the effect that the general public--even subscribers--were never allowed in any of the branches as sightseers, and that all I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> stores and general arrangements, for which he enclosed a view-card." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could do}} nothing, so I sat up, fascinated and powerless, {{and watched the}} struggle. The noonday sun beat down with {{dazzling}} brightness on the naked tennis court. And it was naked. All I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> blotch of shadow and the rainbow flashes, the dust rising from the invisible feet, the earth tearing up from beneath the straining foot-grips, and the wire screen bulge once or twice as their bodies hurled against it. That was all, and after a time even that ceased. There were no more flashes, and the shadow had become long and stationary; and I remembered their set boyish faces when they clung to the roots in the deep coolness of the pool.|$|E

60|$|In vain I {{waited for}} him to start some popular song. His records were only of the best, and the care he took of them was a revelation. He handled each one reverently, as a sacred thing, untying and unwrapping it and {{brushing}} it with a fine camel's hair brush while it revolved and ere he placed the needle on it. For a time all I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> huge brute hands of a brute-driver, with skin off the knuckles, that expressed love in their every movement. Each touch on the discs was a caress, and while the record played he hovered over it and dreamed in some heaven of music all his own.|$|E
60|$|Altogether {{the best}} I {{could do was}} to lie still, see my shot-gun handy, {{and wait for the}} explosion. But it was a solemn kind of a business. The {{blackness}} of the night was like solid; the only thing you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> nasty bogy glimmer of the dead wood, and that showed you nothing but itself; and as for sounds, I stretched my ears till I thought I could have heard the match burn in the tunnel, and that bush was as silent as a coffin. Now {{and then there was a}} bit of a crack; but whether it was near or far, whether it was Case stubbing his toes within a few yards of me, or a tree breaking miles away, I knew no more than the babe unborn.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{of course}} it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always {{appeared}} when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction." ...|$|E

60|$|The snarling of {{the dogs}} halted him. The leader, a heavy dog, half Newfoundland and half Hudson Bay, stood over {{the body of the}} man that lay on the trail, and menaced Morganson with bristling hair and bared fangs. The other seven dogs of the team were {{likewise}} bristling and snarling. Morganson approached tentatively, and the team surged towards him. He stopped again and talked to the animals, threatening and cajoling by turns. He noticed the face of the man under the leader's feet, and was surprised at how quickly it had turned white with the ebb of life and the entrance of the frost. John Thompson lay back {{along the top of the}} loaded sled, his head sunk in a space between two sacks and his chin tilted upwards, so that all Morganson <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> black beard pointing skyward.|$|E
6000|$|The {{thought of}} the day still ahead of me, through which I must somehow press on, keep alive, half stupefied me with dread. We can shut our eyes and our mouths and our hearts; why cannot we stop thinking? The awful passive order of life: its mechanicalness. All that I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> blank white face of its clock--but no more of the wheels than of the Winder. No haste, no intervention, no stretching-out beyond one's finger tips. So the world wore away; life decayed; the {{dunghill}} smoked. Mrs Monnerie there; stepping into her brougham, ebony cane in hand, Marvell at her elbow; Mrs Bowater languishing on board ship, limp head in stiff frilling; Sir Walter dumb; the showman cursing his wretched men; the bills being posted, the implacable future mutely yawning, the past unutterable. Everything in its orbit. Was there no help, no refuge? ...|$|E
60|$|Julian nodded, threw two {{or three}} of the sheep-skins down in a corner, rolled another up for a pillow, drew a blanket over him, {{and for the first time}} looked round the cave. It was lighted only by a small hole used as a look-out; at present a blanket hung before this. There was a door similar to that by which he had entered from above leading to the lower cave. How far that lower {{entrance}} might be below them Julian had no means of knowing, but from the view he had obtained of the sea through a large loop-hole he had passed in his descent, he did not think that the cavern he was in could be less than seventy or eighty feet above the water. The sole ventilation, as far as he <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> current of air that found its way in through the door from below, and passed up through that above, and what could come in through the loop-hole seawards. Doubtless in warmer weather both the doors stood open, but were now closed more for warmth than for any other purpose, although he had noticed that the lower one had been bolted and locked after he had been first captured.|$|E
