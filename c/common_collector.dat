25|$|Transistor-based {{amplification}} can {{be realized}} using various configurations: for example a bipolar junction transistor can realize common base, <b>common</b> <b>collector</b> or common emitter amplification; a MOSFET can realize common gate, common source or common drain amplification.

25|$|One set of classifications for {{amplifiers}} {{is based}} on which device terminal is common to both the input and the output circuit. In the case of bipolar junction transistors, the three classes are common emitter, common base, and <b>common</b> <b>collector.</b> For field-effect transistors, the corresponding configurations are common source, common gate, and common drain; for vacuum tubes, common cathode, common grid, and common plate.|$|E
25|$|The {{common emitter}} (or common source, common cathode, etc.) {{is most often}} {{configured}} to provide amplification of a voltage applied between base and emitter, and the output signal taken between collector and emitter is inverted, relative to the input. The <b>common</b> <b>collector</b> arrangement applies the input voltage between base and collector, and to take the output voltage between emitter and collector. This causes negative feedback, and the output voltage tends to follow the input voltage. This arrangement is also used as the input presents a high impedance and does not load the signal source, though the voltage amplification is less than one. The common-collector circuit is, therefore, better known as an emitter follower, source follower, or cathode follower.|$|E
2500|$|The (class-A) {{voltage gain}} stage (outlined in magenta) {{consists}} of the two NPN transistors Q15/Q19 connected in a Darlington configuration and uses the output side of current mirror Q12/Q13 as its collector (dynamic) load to achieve its high voltage gain. The output sink transistor Q20 receives its base drive from the <b>common</b> <b>collectors</b> of Q15 and Q19; the level-shifter Q16 provides base drive for the output source transistor Q14.|$|R

2500|$|The uropygial gland, informally {{known as}} the preen gland or the oil gland, is a bilobate sebaceous gland possessed by the {{majority}} of birds. [...] It is located dorsally {{at the base of the}} tail (between the fourth caudal vertebrae and the pygostyle) and is greatly variable in both shape and size. [...] In some species, the opening of the gland has a small tuft of feathers to provide a [...] for the preen oil (see below). [...] It is a holocrine gland enclosed in a connective tissue capsule made up of glandular acini that deposit their oil secretion into a <b>common</b> <b>collector</b> tube ending in a variable number of pores (openings), most usually two. Each lobe has a central cavity that collects the secretion from tubules arranged radially around the cavity. The gland secretion is conveyed to the surface via ducts that, in most species, open at the top of a papilla (nipple-like structure).|$|E

50|$|Collectors are {{the main}} {{additives}} used to improve particle surfaces. They function as surfactants to selectively isolate and aid adsorption between the particles of interest and bubbles rising through the slurry. <b>Common</b> <b>collectors</b> used in flotation are anionic sulfur ligands, which have a bifunctional structure with an ionic portion which shares attraction with metals, and a hydrophobic portion such as a long hydrocarbon tail. These collectors coat a particle’s surface with a monolayer of non-polar substance to aid separation from the aqueous phase by decreasing the adsorbed particle solubility in water. The adsorbed ligands can form micelles around the particles and form small-particle colloids improving stability and phase separation further.|$|R

40|$|A {{temperature}} responsive transmitter {{is provided}} in which frequency varies linearly with temperature. The transmitter includes two identically biased transistors connected in parallel. A capacitor, which reflects into the common bases to generate negative resistance effectively in parallel with the capacitor, {{is connected to the}} common emitters. A crystal is effectively in parallel with the capacitor and the negative resistance. Oscillations occur if the magnitude of the absolute value of the negative resistance is less than the positive resistive impedance of the capacitor and the inductance of the crystal. The crystal has a large linear temperature coefficient and a resonant frequency which is substantially less than the gain-bandwidth product of the transistors to ensure that the crystal primarily determines the frequency of oscillation.

50|$|The {{two most}} <b>common</b> types of <b>collector</b> panels are Flat-Plate and Evacuated-tube.

5000|$|Another {{album in}} the Ottoman royal {{collection}} contains only Western images, mostly prints but including a drawing in pen of an Ornamental Scroll with Putti and Penises, [...] "for the merriment of adult guests {{at a dinner}} in Pera". The collection was probably assembled for a Florentine in the late 15th century, probably a merchant living in Istanbul (where Pera was the quarter for Westerners). The other 15 images are a mixed group of Florentine engravings, mostly unique impressions (i.e. otherwise unknown), with some religious subjects and a coloured print of Mehmet II, who apparently acquired the album. It is of interest to art historians because only a small handful of early albums of Western prints survive anywhere, having been broken up by later collectors or dealers; they were probably <b>common</b> among <b>collectors</b> in Europe at the time.|$|R
50|$|The {{heart of}} an I2L circuit is the <b>common</b> emitter open <b>collector</b> {{inverter}}. Typically, an inverter {{consists of an}} NPN transistor with the emitter connected to ground and the base biased with a forward current. The input is supplied to the base as either a current sink (low logic level) or as a high-z floating condition (high logic level). The output of an inverter is at the collector. Likewise, it is either a current sink (low logic level) or a high-z floating condition (high logic level).|$|R
50|$|When a split supply (dual power supply) is available, this biasing circuit is {{the most}} effective, and {{provides}} zero bias voltage at the emitter or collector for load. The negative supply VEE is used to forward-bias the emitter junction through RE. The positive supply VCC is used to reverse-bias the collector junction. Only two resistors are necessary for the <b>common</b> <b>collector</b> stage and four resistors for the common emitter or common base stage.|$|E
50|$|The circuit {{topology}} {{also affects}} {{input and output}} impedance. In general, the source impedance is matched to the input impedance because that will maximize the power transfer from the source to the device. If the source impedance is low, then a common base or common gate circuit topology may be appropriate. For a medium source impedance, a common emitter or common source topology may be used. With a high source resistance, a <b>common</b> <b>collector</b> or common drain topology may be appropriate.|$|E

500|$|Anticipation for {{the game}} was high. Atari stated in 1981 that it had preorders for [...] "three or four million" [...] copies of the Atari 2600 version. Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Simon {{predicted}} the sale of 9million units during 1982, which would yield a profit of $200million. Pac-Man met with initial commercial success, selling 7million copies and eventually becoming the best-selling Atari 2600 title; Frye reportedly received $0.10 in royalties per copy. More than one million of those cartridges had been shipped in less than one month, helped by Atari's $1.5 million publicity campaign. [...] However, purchases soon slowed and, by summer 1982, unsold copies were available in large quantities. Many buyers returned the games for refunds, and Atari was left with 5million excess copies {{in addition to the}} returns. By 2004, the cartridges were still very <b>common</b> among <b>collectors</b> and enthusiasts—though the Sears versions were rarer—and priced lower.|$|R
