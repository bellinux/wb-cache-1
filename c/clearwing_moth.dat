50|$|Sesioidea is the {{superfamily}} currently containing <b>clearwing</b> <b>moths</b> (Sesiidae), castniid moths (Castniidae) {{and little}} bear moths (Brachodidae).

5|$|Aposematism {{has also}} led to the {{development}} of mimicry complexes of Batesian mimicry, where edible species mimic aposematic taxa, and Müllerian mimicry, where inedible species, often of related taxa, have evolved to resemble each other, so as to benefit from reduced sampling rates by predators during learning. Similarly, adult Sesiidae species (also known as <b>clearwing</b> <b>moths)</b> have a general appearance that is sufficiently similar to a wasp or hornet to make it likely that the moths gain a reduction in predation by Batesian mimicry.|$|R

50|$|Hemaris is a genus of sphinx moths in the {{subfamily}} Macroglossinae, {{which is}} native to the Holarctic. Their main host plants are herbs and shrubs of the teasel and honeysuckle families. Moths in genus Hemaris are known collectively as <b>clearwing</b> <b>moths</b> or hummingbird moths in the US and bee hawk-moths in Britain. The related Old World hummingbird moths, genus Macroglossum, are similar in appearance and habits. Both genera have tails that are provided with an expansile truncated tuft of hairs, but only Hemaris has the disc of the wings transparent, as these scales are dropped soon after eclosion.|$|R

50|$|The Sesiidae or <b>clearwing</b> <b>moths</b> are {{a family}} of the Lepidoptera in most species of which the wings {{partially}} have hardly any of the normal lepidopteran scales, leaving them transparent. The bodies are generally striped with yellow, red or white, sometimes very brightly, and they have simple antennae. The general appearance is sufficiently similar to a wasp or hornet to make it likely that the moths gain a reduction in predation by Batesian mimicry. This enables them to be active in daylight. They are commonly collected using pheromone lures. Worldwide there are 151 genera, 1370 species, and 50 subspecies. Most of these occur in the tropics, {{but there are many}} species in the Holarctic region.|$|R
40|$|The Brachodidae are a {{relatively}} small family that, together with the <b>Clearwing</b> <b>moths</b> (Sesiidae) and the Sun moths (Castniidae), form the superfamily Sesi-oidea (Minet 1991). The present concept of Bracho-didae with two subfamilies, Brachodinae and Phycod-inae, was established by Heppner (1981), but the monophyly {{of the family and}} its placement in the Sesioidea is still disputed. A probable family autapo-morphy is the strong reduction or loss of the ventral arms of the laterocervicalia (Minet 1991). Another character which may prove to be autapomorphic is a conspicuously bicoloured type of scales on forewings and thorax (dark, with a white or light grey distal spot).
