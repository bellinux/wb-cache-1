Political reforms however have been slower to realise and the Presidential Republic still remains a highly centralised and autocratic regime. Some 23 years beyond independence this paper assesses whether the role played by the NGO sector has changed and, as a consequence, the asymmetric state-society fulcrum has shifted in favour of a stronger societal voice in Kazakhstan.

40|$|Phenazepam is {{a potent}} 1, 4 -benzodiazepine that has gained notoriety among {{recreational}} drug users. First synthesized in Ukraine in the 1970 s, {{it is one of}} the most commonly prescribed benzodiazepines in Russia and other <b>commonwealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>independent</b> <b>state</b> nations, where it is used therapeutically as a prescription drug. Reports of abuse are widespread and several European countries have taken steps to control its use. However, in the USA, phenazepam is not approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration, nor scheduled under the Federal Controlled Substances Act. Phenazepam is widely available on the Internet, and recreational drug users report a potency 10 -fold greater than that of nordiazepam. We report a case of a 24 -year-old male driver who was apprehended for impaired driving following a two-vehicle crash. The subject exhibited slurred speech and profound psychomotor impairment. Toxicology testing revealed phenazepam at a concentration of 76 ng/mL in blood, with no other drugs detected. This case report not only demonstrates the potential for adverse traffic safety consequences following the misuse of phenazepam, but also highlights the importance of analyt-ical factors such as immunoassay cutoff concentration, cross-re-activity and comprehensive screening using chromatographic-based techniques for impaired driving investigations...|$|R
40|$|Like many {{emerging}} market economies, the Ukrainian economy is partially dollarized – in fact, its entire period of independence {{has been marked}} by significant dollarization. What makes this situation more striking is that, while Ukraine has witnessed two very different monetary regimes since independence, the extent of dollarization appears to be largely unchanged across the two regimes. We offer an explanation of this phenomenon, highlighting the significant role the shadow economy plays in Ukraine, and we discuss implications for dollarization or euroization in Ukraine’s future. An economy is partially dollarized when a foreign currency (often the US dollar) performs {{at least some of the}} major functions of money alongside a domestic currency. Like many {{emerging market}} economies throughout the world and all the economies <b>of</b> the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>State</b> (CIS), the diplomatic successor of the Soviet Union, the economy of Ukraine is partially dollarized (Antinolfi and Keister, 2001).

In late 1993 he accused 70 senior government officials, including the Supreme Soviet chairman Stanislav Shushkevich and prime minister Vyacheslav Kebich, of corruption including stealing state funds for personal purposes. While the charges were never fully proven against him, Shushkevich resigned his chairmanship due to the embarrassment of the series of events and losing a vote of no-confidence. He served in that position until July 1994.|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{phenomenon}} of corruption that has become com-mon in higher education in developing countries around the world. Cases of educational corruption include, among others, paying bribes for grades, buying diplomas, and admissions to universities. An available body of litera-ture on educational corruption does not provide sufficient insight on the na-ture {{and structure of the}} phenomenon. This article attempts to fill in the gaps by developing the taxonomy of corruption in higher education. This taxon-omy distinguishes educational-specific corruption from that common to any public sector by identifying corruption that directly and indirectly involves students. Moreover, this article distinguishes different types of educational-specific corruption depending on the area of occurrence and the agents in-volved. This classification disaggregates the complex phenomenon of cor-ruption in higher education and develops common understanding of its structure and possible agreement on definitions. Different types of corrup-tion may require different theoretical and methodological approaches if re-search is to be conducted on educational corruption. Deconstruction of cor-ruption in higher education serves as a tool for further research. Corruption has become a widespread phenomenon in higher education institutions in countries <b>of</b> the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>State...</b>|$|R
40|$|The 23 former socialist {{countries}} in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>State</b> (CIS) started the transition in 1989 – 1990 {{from a common}} institutional and organizational heritage, represented by the Soviet agricultural model. Despite the common heritage in agriculture, the reform policies in CEE and CIS diverged from the start, as significant differences emerged {{between the two groups}} of {{countries in}} legal attitudes to private land ownership, transfer-ability of land, the extent of agricultural privatization and individualization, and restructuring of farms. This divergence in the implementation of agricultural reform has led to divergence in standard development measures: the CEE countries are outperforming the CIS countries by growth in GDP and agricultural product since 1992; the productivity of agricultural labor in CEE is generally increasing, and in CIS it is decreasing. While the CIS countries at best can be characterized as reluctant re-formers, the CEE countries have achieved significantly higher levels of economic and institutional reform. Better performance in CEE is associated with greater readiness of the governments in these countries to implement a comprehensive package of economic and social reform policies, including more radical land reform and deeper individualization and restructuring o...|$|R

In this respect, in the first chapters, I would introduce a brief description of development of the country before 1991.

However, the transformation process would be analyzed {{at the same time in}} further chapters, concerning development of the main macroeconomic indicators, such as growth of GDP, inflation rate, unemployment, and the level of living.

5|$|Outside North America and Western Europe, the Labrador arrived later. For example, the Russian Retriever Club {{traces the}} arrival of Labradors to the late 1960s, as {{household}} pets of diplomats {{and others in the}} foreign ministry. The establishment of the breed in the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>States</b> (former USSR) was initially hindered by the relatively small numbers of Labradors and great distances involved, leading to difficulty establishing breedings and bloodlines; {{at the start of the}} 1980s, home-born dogs were still regularly supplemented by further imports from overseas. Difficulties such as these initially led to Labradors being tacitly cross-bred to other types of retriever. In the 1990s, improved access to overseas shows and bloodlines is said to have helped this situation become regularised.|$|E
5|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, residents of the Donbass were generally in favour of stronger ties with Russia, in contrast to the rest of Ukraine. A 1993 strike by miners in the region called for a federal Ukraine and economic autonomy for Donbass. This was followed by a 1994 consultative referendum on various constitutional questions in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, held concurrently with the first parliamentary elections in independent Ukraine. These questions included whether Russian should be enshrined as an official language of Ukraine, whether Russian should be the language of administration in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, whether Ukraine should federalise, and whether Ukraine should have closer ties with the <b>Commonwealth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>States.</b> Close to 90% of voters voted in favour of these propositions. None of them were adopted: Ukraine remained a unitary state, Ukrainian was retained as the sole official language, and the Donbass gained no autonomy.|$|E

Since a referendum in 1995, the country has had two official languages: Belarusian and Russian. The Constitution of Belarus does not declare any official religion, although the primary religion in the country is Eastern Orthodox Christianity. The second-most widespread religion, Roman Catholicism, has a much smaller following; nevertheless, Belarus celebrates both Orthodox and Catholic versions of Christmas and Easter as national holidays.
