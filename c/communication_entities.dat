In addition, the smart home sensors have so low computing resources that they cannot process complicated computation tasks, which is required to create a proper security environment.

40|$|A way {{to create}} well-functioning {{computer}} systems is to automate error detection in the systems. Automated techniques for finding errors, such as testing and formal verification, requires {{a model of the}} system. The technique for constructing deterministic finite automata (DFA) models, without access to the source code, is called regular inference. The technique provides sequences of input, so called membership queries, to a system, observes the responses, and infers a model from the input and responses. This thesis presents work to adapt regular inference to a certain kind of systems: <b>communication</b> protocol <b>entities.</b> Such entities interact by sending and receiving messages consisting of a message type and a number of parameters, each of which potentially can take on a large number of values. This may cause a model of a <b>communication</b> protocol <b>entity</b> inferred by regular inference, to be very large and {{take a long time to}} infer. Since regular inference creates a model from the observed behavior of a <b>communication</b> protocol <b>entity,</b> the model may be very different from a designer's model of the system's source code. This thesis presents adaptations of regular inference to infer more compact models and use less membership queries. The first contribution is a survey over three algorithms for regular inference. We present their similarities and their differences in terms of the required number of membership queries. The second contribution is an investigation on how many membership queries a common regular inference algorithm, the L* algorithm by Angluin, requires for randomly generated DFAs and randomly generated DFAs with a structure common for <b>communication</b> protocol <b>entities.</b> In comparison, the DFAs with a structure common for <b>communication</b> protocol <b>entities</b> require more membership queries. The third contribution is an adaptation of regular inference to <b>communication</b> protocol <b>entities</b> which behavior foremost are affected by the message types. The adapted algorithm avoids asking membership queries containing messages with parameter values that results in already observed responses. The fourth contribution is an approach for regular inference of <b>communication</b> protocol <b>entities</b> which communicate with messages containing parameter values from very large ranges. The approach infers compact models, and uses parameter values taken from a small portion of their ranges in membership queries. The fifth contribution is an approach to infer compact models of <b>communication</b> protocol <b>entities</b> which have a similar partitioning of an entity's behavior into control states as in a designer's model of the protocol...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Existing {{algorithms}} {{for regular}} inference (aka automata learning) allows to infer a {{finite state machine}} model of a system under test (SUT) by observing the output that the SUT produces in response to selected sequences of input. In this paper we present an approach using regular inference to construct models of <b>communication</b> protocol <b>entities.</b> <b>Entities</b> of <b>communication</b> protocols typically take input messages in the format of a protocol data unit (PDU) type together {{with a number of}} parameters and produce output of the same format. We assume that parameters from input can be stored in state variables of communication protocols for later use. A model of a communication protocol is usually structured into control states. Our goal is to infer symbolic extended finite state machine models of <b>communication</b> protocol <b>entities</b> with control states in the model that are similar to the control states in the communication protocol. In our approach, we first apply an existing regular inference algorithm to a <b>communication</b> protocol <b>entity</b> to generate a finite state machine model of the entity. Thereafter we fold the generated model into a symbolic extended finite state machine model with locations and state variables. We have applied parts of our approach to an executable specification of the Mobile Arts Advanced Mobile Location Center (A-MLC) protocol and evaluated the results. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ€”The {{changes in}} the {{communication}} paradigm envisioned for future networks, with peer-to-peer/symmetric attachments gaining momentum and two IP (Internet Protocol) versions coexisting, will pose new challenges to mobile communication networks. Traditional IP auto-configuration mechanisms will not work properly, since they were designed mostly having in mind a client-server/asymmetric attachment model, they assume a single IP version paradigm, and they target the auto-configuration of devices only. The IST Ambient Networks project has introduced a new concept â€“ the Ambient Network â€“ that enables handling every <b>communication</b> <b>entity,</b> either a single device or an entire network, as an Ambient Network (AN). This paper describes a new efficient mechanism, named Basic Connectivity (BC) mechanism, for auto-configuring IP connectivity between attaching ANs. A proof-of-concept prototype, experimental results, and theoretical analysis show that BC suites the future networking paradigm and represents a solution more efficient than the current trial-and-error mechanism for auto-configuring IP connectivity...|$|R
