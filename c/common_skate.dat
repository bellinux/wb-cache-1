25|$|The <b>common</b> <b>skate</b> {{is listed}} as a Critically Endangered species by the IUCN. It is {{threatened}} both in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. It has both been targeted directly and caught incidentally as bycatch. Due to the profitability of trawl fishing, {{it is likely that}} bycatch will remain a serious problem for the <b>common</b> <b>skate.</b> The species is extirpated in the Baltic Sea. Remaining strongholds are off western Scotland, in the Celtic Sea and along the coast of Norway.|$|E
25|$|Egg case hunts {{have been}} done {{throughout}} the general distribution of the <b>common</b> <b>skate.</b> In the British Isles, egg cases were only found in northern Scotland and the north of Ireland. In the 19th and 20th centuries egg cases were seen along the entire British coastline in high numbers, {{but now they are}} only found in a few selective areas.|$|E
25|$|Because the <b>common</b> <b>skate</b> is {{long-lived}} {{and slow}} to mature, {{it is difficult}} for it to repopulate quickly. Coupled with overfishing, this means that the common skate's population has drastically decreased and it is likely it will disappear entirely unless more is done to preserve it. It is strictly protected within the EU, making it illegal for commercial fishers to actively fish for it or keep it if accidentally landed. Like other elasmobranchs, it is believed to {{have a good chance of}} surviving if released after being caught.|$|E

They mate {{in the spring and}} during the summer females lay approximately 40 egg cases in sandy or muddy flats. The eggs develop for 2–5 months before hatching.|$|E
2500|$|Like other skates, the <b>common</b> <b>skate</b> is {{a bottom}} feeder. Its diet {{consists}} of crustaceans, clams, oysters, snails, bristle worms, cephalopods, and small to medium-sized fish (such as sand eel, flatfish, monkfish, catsharks, spurdog, other skates). The {{size of the}} individual can affect its diet. Larger ones eat larger things like fish. The bigger the skate is the more food that {{will be needed to}} sustain its large body size. The activity level determines how much it eats; the more active it is the more it eats. [...] The <b>common</b> <b>skate</b> does not only feed on creatures {{at the bottom of the}} ocean, as some do ascend to feed on mackerel, herring, and other pelagic fish, which are caught by rapidly moving up from the seabed to grab the prey.|$|E
2500|$|Media {{attention}} {{has recently been}} drawn to angling on Harris, and Tarbert in particular.

2500|$|The <b>common</b> <b>skate</b> {{can reach}} up to [...] in length, [...] in width and [...] in weight, {{making it the}} largest skate in the world. Overall shape {{features}} a pointed snout and rhombic shape, with a row of spines or thorns along the tail. [...] The top surface is generally coloured olive-grey to brown, often with a pattern of spots, and the underside is lighter blue-grey. It can be confused with several other skates in its range, such as D. nidarosiensis, D. oxyrinchus and Rostroraja alba.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>common</b> <b>skate</b> or blue skate (Dipturus batis, syn. Raja batis) is {{the largest}} skate in the world {{attaining}} a length of up to [...] Historically, {{it was one of}} the most abundant skates in the northeast Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Despite its name, today it appears to be absent from much of this range. Where previously abundant, fisheries directly targeted this skate and elsewhere it is caught incidentally as bycatch. The species was uplisted to Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2006 and it is protected within the EU.|$|E
2500|$|Research {{published}} in 2009 and 2010 {{found that there}} are distinct genetic and morphological differences within the <b>common</b> <b>skate</b> as traditionally defined, leading to the suggestion of splitting it into two species: The smaller (up to about [...] in length) southern D. cf. flossada (blue skate), and the larger and slower-growing northern D. cf. intermedia (flapper skate). Under this taxonomic arrangement, the name D. batis is discarded. Alternatively, the scientific name D. batis (with flossada as a synonym) is retained for the blue skate and D. intermedia for the flapper skate.|$|E
50|$|Pavoraja umbrosa (<b>common</b> name: dusky <b>skate)</b> is {{a species}} of fish in Rajidae family. It lives {{off the coast of}} northeastern Australia in depths ranging from 360 to 731 meters. Its maximum size is 36.9 cm total length.|$|R
50|$|Pavoraja mosaica (<b>common</b> name: mosaic <b>skate)</b> is {{a species}} of fish in the Rajidae family. It lives in depths ranging from 300 meters to 450 meters off the northeastern coast of Australia. Its maximum size is 27.9 cm total length.|$|R
50|$|The powerslide is a braking {{method used}} in inline skating where both skates are quickly {{moved into a}} {{position}} perpendicular to the moving direction of the skater. Whereas braking this way is quite <b>common</b> in ice <b>skating</b> (where it is called a hockey stop), any irregularity on the surface can make a novice roller skater easily lose balance and fall.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>common</b> <b>skate</b> is {{native to}} the {{northeast}} Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea.

At the start of the twentieth century common skates had a wide range around the British Isles. Now their population and range is severely depleted and fragmented, with disappearances being reported on several places.|$|E
60|$|Let me {{tell you}} what we do in the {{biological}} laboratory which is lodged in a building adjacent to this. There I lecture to a class of students daily for about four-and-a-half months, and my class have, of course, their text-books; but the essential part of the whole teaching, and that which I regard as really {{the most important part of}} it, is a laboratory for practical work, which is simply a room with all the appliances needed for ordinary dissection. We have tables properly arranged in regard to light, microscopes, and dissecting instruments, and we work through the structure of a certain number of animals and plants. As, for example, among the plants, we take a yeast plant, a Protococcus, a common mould, a Chara, a fern, and some flowering plant; among animals we examine such things as an Amoeba, a Vorticella, and a fresh-water polype. We dissect a star-fish, an earth-worm, a snail, a squid, and a fresh-water mussel. We examine a lobster and a cray-fish, and a black beetle. We go on to a <b>common</b> <b>skate,</b> a cod-fish, a frog, a tortoise, a pigeon, and a rabbit, and that takes us about all the time we have to give. The purpose of this course is not to make skilled dissectors, but to give every student a clear and definite conception, by means of sense-images, of the characteristic structure of each of the leading modifications of the animal kingdom; and that is perfectly possible, by going no further than the length of that list of forms which I have enumerated. If a man knows the structure of the animals I have mentioned, he has a clear and exact, however limited, apprehension of the essential features of the organisation of all those great divisions of the animal and vegetable kingdoms to which the forms I have mentioned severally belong. And it then becomes possible for him to read with profit; because every time he meets with the name of a structure, he has a definite image in his mind of what the name means in the particular creature he is reading about, and therefore the reading is not mere reading. It is not mere repetition of words; but every term employed in the description, we will say, of a horse, or of an elephant, will call up the image of the things he had seen in the rabbit, and he is able to form a distinct conception of that which he has not seen, as a modification of that which he has seen.|$|E
50|$|It is {{estimated}} that the <b>common</b> <b>skate</b> can reach an age of 50-100 years and maturity is reached when about 11 years old. Males are mature at a length of 1.25 m and females, where not yet determined for certain, are estimated to reach it at about 1.5 m. For every male <b>common</b> <b>skate</b> there is approximately one female <b>common</b> <b>skate,</b> so the sex ratio is 1:1, but this can vary depending on geography and season. When hatching, juveniles measure up to 22.3 cm long. Once it has reached sexual maturity, they will only reproduce every other year.

50|$|The Pavoraja arenaria (<b>common</b> name: sandy <b>skate,</b> yellow skate) is {{a species}} of fish in Rajidae family. It lives in depths ranging from 192 to 712 meters but is usually found from 300 to 400 meters out the coast of western Australia. Its maximum size is 34.3 cm total length. It is a little-known species that could be {{threatened}} by being taken as by-catch in trawl fisheries.|$|R
5000|$|A twizzle is a multirotational one-foot turn {{in figure}} skating. The twizzle is most {{commonly}} seen in ice dancing, where {{it appears in}} a number of Pattern Dances (originally called Compulsory Dance) and is a required element of step sequences in the short dance, original dance and free dance. [...] A twizzle is also <b>common</b> in synchronized <b>skating</b> where it is also a required element of step sequences.|$|R
50|$|The axel is {{a figure}} skating jump with a forward take off. It {{is named after}} Norwegian figure skater Axel Paulsen, who, in 1882, was the first skater to perform the jump. Compared to other <b>common</b> figure <b>skating</b> jumps, an axel has an extra ½ {{rotation}} in the air because of its forward take off. Most skaters perform the jump with counterclockwise rotation, taking off from the left forward outside edge and landing on the right back outside edge. (But a minority of skaters perform it the opposite direction). The axel can also be done as a double jump with 2 ½ rotations, or as a triple jump with 3 ½ rotations, or a quadruple axel with 4 1/2 rotations, but no skater has yet accomplished a quadruple axel in competition.|$|R

40|$|The sharks, {{rays and}} skates form one of the {{important}} commercial fisheries of India, the average annual landings for 10 years (1958 - 67) being 33, 442 m. tons. Of this, 15, 537 m. tons are landed along the east coast and 17, 605 m. tons along the west coast and the rest at Andaman and Nicobar and Laccadive groups of islands. Reports indicate that the Indian Ocean offers valuable fishing grounds for these fishes, especially for the larger varieties which can substantially augment the supplies of food, liver-oils, fins and shagreen. Along the east coast, good fishery for elasmobranchs exists along the coasts of Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Madras State and in Andaman Islands. These fishes are caught almost round the year, the sharks on hook and line and in drift gill nets at depths varying from 16 to 100 metres and majority of {{rays and skates}} in trawl nets, drift and bottom set gill nets and shore seines at depths ranging from 4 to 100 metres. The common species of sharks include the blacktip-finned sharks of the genus Carcharhinus, species of Scoliodon, the hammer-head sharks, Sphyrna spp., the tiger-shark, Galeocerdo cuvieri and the zebra shark, Stegostoma fasciatum. The whale shark, Rhincodon typus, is occasionally landed. Rays of commercial importance are the cownose ray, Rhinoptera javanica shoals of which make frequent incursions into coastal waters of Gulf of Mannar, the butterfly ray, Gymmura poecilura, Himantura spp., Amphotistius zugei, Pastinachus sephen and the devil ray, Mobula diabolus. The <b>common</b> <b>skates</b> include Rhynchobatus djiddensis and Rhinobatus granulatiis and the saw-fishes of the genus Pristis. From the present trend, {{it would appear that the}} catches of elasmobranchs off the east coast could be substantially increased by extending fishing operations to deeper waters especially in the Gulf of Mannar and by the use of stronger nets from mechanised vessels. Fruitful results may also be expected along the east coast, including Andaman Islands by exploratory surveys to chart potentially rich grounds for these fishes...|$|R
5000|$|Jumps {{that are}} not {{directly}} linked from landing to take-off edge are considered sequences. Sequences often include [...] "decorative" [...] jumps like mazurkas or stag jumps. Long sequences of single and double jumps used to be <b>common</b> in figure <b>skating</b> through the 1980s, but became more rare as skaters instead packed their programs with triple and quadruple jumps. Under the ISU Judging System, jump sequences are worth 80% of what they would be worth if the same jumps were executed in combination, {{and in some cases}} carry less value than just doing the most difficult jump in the sequence as a solo jump.|$|R
50|$|Clew Bay {{itself is}} a sea angling centre hosting many sea fishing {{competitions}} each year and it {{is known as a}} venue for <b>common</b> <b>skate</b> fishing in the country and holds the Irish record for a 160 lb white skate.

5000|$|After the ISU Judging System {{was adopted}} in 2004, these {{guidelines}} were further tightened up to specify a fixed number {{of each type}} of element. This effectively has given the free skating a specific list of required elements, since skaters get no credit and are penalized for extra elements and cannot achieve maximum points {{if they do not}} include the maximum number of elements allowed. In addition, the ISU Judging System discounts certain elements that were formerly <b>common</b> in free <b>skating</b> programs, such as Axel variants and other single and double jumps used as highlight moves or in jump sequences. Effectively, [...] "free skating" [...] under the IJS no longer allows the freedom to have unlimited attempts at elements, and skaters must include the exact number of allowable elements in their program.|$|R
5000|$|Developments in {{multi-line}} kites {{in recent}} years has allowed forms of kite flying to develop into a sport. Kite competitions have much in <b>common</b> with figure <b>skating,</b> with competitors being judged on their performance in compulsory figures as well as a [...] "ballet", which involves artistic interpretation of music. Performances are done as individuals, a pair of pilots, or as a team. Team flying is typically the most spectacular, with up to eight pilots, their kites flying within inches of each other and narrowly averting disaster, while performing all manner of figures and formations in the air. Competitions are held nationally and internationally under the auspices of Sport Team and Competitive Kiting (STACK). There is a bi-annual World Championship which was last held at Berck sur Mer, France in April 2014 and won for the third consecutive time by British team 'The Scratch Bunnies'. They are the first ever team to hold the title on three consecutive occasions.|$|R
