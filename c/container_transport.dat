While several rail services were replaced by road coach services, West Coast Railway successfully tendered to operate the railway line to Warrnambool, becoming the first private operator in Victoria.

25|$|Maersk {{plans to}} use the ships on routes between Europe and Asia. In 2008 there was a {{reduction}} in demand for <b>container</b> <b>transport</b> caused by recessions in many countries. This left shipping lines in financial difficulties in 2009, with surplus capacity. Some ships were laid up or scrapped. However, there was a sudden resurgence of demand for <b>container</b> <b>transport</b> in 2010; Maersk posted its largest ever profit, and orders for new ships increased, leading to fresh concerns about future overcapacity. The market was still characterized by overcapacity and decreasing prices for new ships in 2013. China Shipping Container Lines ordered five ships with a capacity of 18,400 TEU from Hyundai Heavy Industries, topping the Triple E class, with delivery from late 2014. United Arab Shipping Company has ordered (also from Hyundai) five slightly larger ships and five ships larger than the Maersk E class. Several other larger ships have been ordered by the industry.|$|E

Splošna plovba, the only Slovenian shipping company, transports freight and is active only in foreign ports.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the bridge}} soon proved to have too little capacity, and sinking {{foundation}} piles created issues.

25|$|In 1958, {{the company}} began {{investigating}} the possibility of containerization, and sent research teams into 28 major ports. Following their reports, Davies began integrating containers into the company's business. By 1961, the company had begun launching ships capable of <b>container</b> <b>transport,</b> the first two of these being the combination break-bulk - container vessels SS President Tyler and SS President Lincoln. Ports also began adapting to the new container-based system, although many potential customers were still wary. By {{the end of the}} decade, the company was still launching combination ships rather than fully cellular container ships as already employed by several U.S., British, European and Japanese lines, yet by 1969, 23% of the company's business moved via container.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the port}} {{facilities}} {{needed to support}} containerization changed. One effect was the decline of some ports {{and the rise of}} others. At the Port of San Francisco, the former piers used for loading and unloading were no longer required, but there was little room to build the vast holding lots needed for <b>container</b> <b>transport.</b> As a result, the Port of San Francisco virtually ceased to function as a major commercial port, but the neighboring port of Oakland emerged as the second largest on the US West Coast. A similar fate met the relation between the ports of Manhattan and New Jersey. In the United Kingdom, the Port of London and Port of Liverpool declined in importance. Meanwhile, Britain's Port of Felixstowe and Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands emerged as major ports. In general, inland ports on waterways incapable of deep-draft ship traffic also declined from containerization in favor of seaports. With intermodal containers, the job of sorting and packing containers could be performed far from the point of embarking.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, the company {{continued}} to modernize its fleet, with ever-larger and faster ships, {{all of which}} were outfitted for <b>container</b> <b>transport.</b> APL also started a door-to-door service, known as the Red Eagle service. Another initiative was to introduce larger container sizes: [...] containers in 1982, [...] containers in 1985 and [...] containers in 1988. Also in 1988, the company developed post-Panamax vessels, those too large to transit the Panama Canal. These ships were [...] long and [...] wide, with the ability to carry 4,300 TEUs, a TEU being an arbitrary container unit [...] long.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a fundamental question related to nearly all container liner shipping planning models: whether the implicit assumption of identical container delivery pattern every week is valid {{in a situation}} of identical shipping services and identical cargo demand every week. We prove that when the number of <b>containers</b> <b>transported</b> from one port to the next is formulated as a continuous variable, the resulting mathematical model with an identical container delivery pattern is equivalent to the model with general container delivery patterns which can be different in different weeks. When the number of <b>containers</b> <b>transported</b> is formulated as an integer variable, the model with an identical container delivery pattern is not equivalent to the model with general container delivery patterns. However, the difference between the optimal objective values of the two models is negligible for practical applications. In sum, little, if not nothing, is lost by assuming an identical container delivery pattern in liner shipping planning models. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R
2500|$|When {{carried by}} rail, {{containers}} may {{be carried on}} flatcars or well cars. The latter are specially designed for <b>container</b> <b>transport,</b> and can accommodate double-stacked containers. However, the loading gauge of a rail system may restrict the modes and types of container shipment. The smaller loading gauges often found in European railroads will only accommodate single-stacked containers. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, there are sections of the rail network through which high-cube containers cannot pass, or can pass through only on well cars. On the other hand, Indian Railways runs double-stacked containers on flatcars under 25 kV overhead electrical wires. The wires {{must be at least}} [...] above the track. China Railway also runs double-stacked containers under overhead wires, but must use well cars to do so, since the wires are only [...] above the track.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} on maritime ports hinterlands {{points out the}} relevance of mass ground transport modes such as barge transport for enormous flows of containers to and from harbours, especially when a maritime port {{is located at the}} mouth of a river. Though, the modal share of <b>container</b> barge <b>transport</b> in French maritime ports (9 % of TEU in Le Havre and 5 % in Marseille in 2007) is significantly lower than elsewhere (32 % in Rotterdam and 33 % in Antwerp). Some reports and studies explain the viscosity of <b>container</b> barge <b>transport</b> flows as a result of several factors, generally concentrated around the seaport community. In continuation of previous seminal works, this paper adopts a neo-institutional approach (Williamson, 1985; 1996) of <b>container</b> barge <b>transport</b> to understand how the factors generating this viscosity are managed. Section 2 describes the characteristics of the transaction of <b>container</b> barge <b>transport.</b> Section 3 is devoted to its attributes (asset specificity, frequency, uncertainty). According to Williamson’s (1996) remediableness criterion, the observed governance structure of a given transaction is presumed efficient and aligned to its attributes. Thus, Section 4 deals with observed governance structures of <b>container</b> barge <b>transport</b> chains with a focus on Le Havre, main French container seaport and shows how agents try to limit opportunism in expost haggling over quasi-rents or under-investments. Implementation of a new institutional environment to modify governance structures is analysed, and a comparison with currently implemented governance structures observed i...|$|R
