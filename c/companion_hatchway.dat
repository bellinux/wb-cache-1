6000|$|... "Get down below, all of you!" [...] {{cried the}} captain, himself taking shelter under the <b>companion</b> <b>hatchway.</b> But {{the order was}} needless, for the danger was so obvious that every one sought {{the shelter of the}} cabins without delay.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{we heard}} a yelp and a volley of furious blasphemy from the <b>companion</b> <b>hatchway,</b> and the {{deformed}} man with the black face came up hurriedly. He was immediately followed by a heavy red-haired {{man in a white}} cap. At the sight of the former the staghounds, who had all tired of barking at me by this time, became furiously excited, howling and leaping against their chains. The black hesitated before them, and this gave the red-haired man time to come up with him and deliver a tremendous blow between the shoulder-blades. The poor devil went down like a felled ox, and rolled in the dirt among the furiously excited dogs. It was lucky for him that they were muzzled. The red-haired man gave a yawp of exultation and stood staggering, and as it seemed to me in serious danger of either going backwards down the <b>companion</b> <b>hatchway</b> or forwards upon his victim.|$|E
6000|$|Towards {{the middle}} of our second week out, we fell in with a storm--a rotatory affair, and soon over by reason that we struck the outer fringe of it; but to a {{landsman}} sufficiently daunting while it lasted. Late in the afternoon I thrust my head up for a look around. We were weltering along in horrible forty-foot seas, over which our bulwarks tilted at times until from the <b>companion</b> <b>hatchway</b> I stared plumb into the grey sliding chasms, and felt like a fly on the wall. The Lady Nepean hurled her old timbers along under close-reefed maintopsail, and a rag of a foresail only. The captain had housed topgallant masts and lashed his guns inboard; yet she rolled so that you would not have trusted a cat on her storm-washed decks. They were desolate but for the captain and helmsman on the poop; the helmsman, a mere lad--the one, in fact, who had pulled the bow-oar to our rescue--lashed and gripping the spokes pluckily, but with a white face which told that, though his eyes were strained on the binnacle, his mind ran on the infernal seas astern. Over him, in sea-boots and oilskins, towered Captain Colenso--rejuvenated, transfigured; his body swaying easily to every lurch and plunge of the brig, his face entirely composed and cheerful, his salt-rimmed eyes contracted a little, but alert and even boyishly bright. An heroical figure of a man! ...|$|E
