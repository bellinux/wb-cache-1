The {{properties}} of metakaolin geopolymer paste {{are affected by}} the alkali concentration, the initial raw materials, solidification process, and amount of mixing water as well as the <b>curing</b> conditions. This study aimed to investigate the effect of <b>curing</b> temperature (room temperature, 40 °C, 60 °C, 80 °C and 100 °C) and <b>curing</b> time (6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h) on the geopolymer pastes produced from geopolymer powder. The results showed that <b>curing</b> at room temperature was unfeasible. Heat was required for the geopolymerization process, where strength increased as the <b>curing</b> temperature was increased. Moderate elevated <b>curing</b> temperature favored the strength development of geopolymer pastes in comparison with those treated with extreme elevated <b>curing</b> temperature. When geopolymer paste was subjected to extreme elevated <b>curing</b> temperature, shorter <b>curing</b> time should be used to avoid deterioration in strength gain. Similarly, longer <b>curing</b> time was recommended for moderate elevated <b>curing</b> temperature. The microstructure of geopolymer paste <b>cured</b> at moderate <b>curing</b> temperature showed obvious densification of structure.

The parameters of the study include the <b>curing</b> period [3, 7, 28 and 56 day], <b>curing</b> method [Air <b>curing,</b> plastic films, immersion under water] and the type of cement [Portland pozzolona Cement(PPC) 43 grade,].

40|$|In this study, a CO 2 <b>curing</b> {{process was}} adopted {{in order to}} promote rapid {{strength}} development of concrete blocks containing recycled aggregates. The influence of several factors associated with the <b>curing</b> conditions on the <b>curing</b> degree and compressive strength of the concrete blocks were investigated, including <b>curing</b> time, temperature, relative humidity, pressure and post-water <b>curing</b> after the pressurized CO 2 <b>curing</b> (PCC) process. In addition a flow-through CO 2 <b>curing</b> (FCC) method at ambient pressure was also used. The results of the PCC experiments showed that, considerable <b>curing</b> degree and compressive strength were attained during the first 2 h of CO 2 <b>curing,</b> and a prolonged <b>curing</b> time yielded slower gains. The variations of temperature from 20 °C to 80 °C and relative humidity from 50 % to 80 % had limited impacts on PCC; but the effects of CO 2 gas pressure on the <b>curing</b> degree and compressive strength were more pronounced. The post-water <b>curing</b> after pressurized CO 2 <b>curing</b> allowed the concrete blocks to attain further strength gain but its effectiveness was inversely proportional to the CO 2 <b>curing</b> degree already attained. The FCC experimental results indicated that although a lower <b>curing</b> degree and slower strength development at the early age were observed, after 24 h of <b>curing</b> duration, they were comparable to those obtained by the PCC method.

The four <b>curing</b> methods {{used in the study}} were: (1) <b>curing</b> at 102 – 105 C for 1 h (based on CSA O 112. 6 - 1977), (2) four-hour <b>curing</b> at 66 C fol- lowed by 1 -hour <b>curing</b> at 150 C (based on ASTM D 1583 - 01), (3) <b>curing</b> at room temperature overnight (based on ASTM D 1583 - 01), and (4) <b>cured</b> adhesive squeezed out from glue lines of bonded shear block samples.
