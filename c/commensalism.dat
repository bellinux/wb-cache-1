5|$|Despite their {{apparent}} simplicity, {{bacteria can}} form complex associations with other organisms. These symbiotic associations {{can be divided}} into parasitism, mutualism and <b>commensalism.</b> Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on animals and plants exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and sweat, and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of body odour.|$|E
5|$|Many parasites {{latch onto}} whales, notably whale lice and whale barnacles. Almost all species of whale lice are {{specialized}} towards a certain species of whale, and {{there can be}} more than one species per whale. Whale lice eat dead skin, resulting in minor wounds in the skin. Whale louse infestations are especially evident in right whales, where colonies propagate on their callosities. Though not a parasite, whale barnacles latch onto the skin of a whale during their larval stage. However, in doing so it does not harm nor benefit the whale, so their relationship is often labeled as an example of <b>commensalism.</b> Some baleen whales will deliberately rub themselves on substrate to dislodge parasites. Some species of barnacle, such as Conchoderma auritum and whale barnacles, attach to the baleen plates, though this seldom occurs. A species of copepod, Balaenophilus unisetus, inhabits baleen plates of whales in tropical waters. A species of Antarctic diatom, Cocconeis ceticola, forms a film on the skin, which takes a month to develop; this film causes minor damage to the skin. They are also plagued by internal parasites such as stomach worms, cestodes, nematodes, liver flukes, and acanthocephalans.|$|E

40|$|Candida albicans {{can cause}} grave infections in {{patients}} who are immunocompromised by diseases, by surgery, or by immunesupresive therapy. The high levels {{of morbidity and mortality}} resulting from those infections in hospitalized patients show that C. albicans became a prominent human pathogen. Although the host immune system is the major factor balancing the transition from <b>commensalisms</b> to pathogenicity, several virulence attributes expressed by C. albicans, such as adhesion factors, phenotypic switching, dimorphic behavior, and secretion of hydrolytic enzymes, might contribute to the persistence of colonization as well as the development of symptomatic episodes. Host defense against candidiasis relies mainly on the ingestion and elimination of C. albicans by phagocytic cells, which present receptors Toll-like 4, dectin– 1 associated to receptors Toll-like 2 and mannose receptors. The cytokine IL- 10 (IL- 10) produced by phagocytes has a crucial role on susceptibility of host fungal infection, whereas IL- 10 produced by regulatory T cells is mainly responsible by <b>commensalisms.</b> In contrast, productions of tumour necrosis factor - α (TNF-α), interleukin– 1 β (lL- 1 β), (IL- 6) and (Il- 12) provided protective cell–mediated immunity.

25|$|An {{example of}} <b>commensalism</b> occurs between the hawkfish and fire coral. Thanks to their large, {{skinless}} pectoral fins, hawkfish can perch on fire corals without harm. Fire corals {{are not true}} corals, but are hydrozoans possessing stinging cells called nematocysts which would normally prevent close contact. The protection fire corals offer hawkfish means the hawkfish has the high ground of the reef, and can safely survey its surroundings like a hawk. Hawkfish usually stay motionless, but dart out and grab crustaceans and other small invertebrates as they pass by. They are mostly solitary, although some species form pairs and share a head of coral.|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} part {{carnivorous}} plant populations are not dominant enough to be dramatically significant, ecologically speaking, {{but there is an}} impressive variety of organisms that interact with various carnivorous plants in sundry relationships of kleptoparasitism, <b>commensalism,</b> and mutualism. For example, small insectivores such as tree frogs often exploit the supply of prey to be found in pitcher plants, and the frog Microhyla nepenthicola actually specialises in such habitats. Certain crab spiders such as Misumenops nepenthicola live largely on the prey of Nepenthes, and other, less specialised, spiders may build webs where they trap insects attracted by the smell or appearance of the traps; some scavengers, detritivores, and also organisms that harvest or exploit those in turn, such as the mosquito Wyeomyia smithii are largely or totally dependent on particular carnivorous plants. Plants such as Roridula species combine with specialised bugs (Pameridea roridulae) in benefiting from insects trapped on their leaves.|$|E

40|$|Associations among {{animals of}} {{different}} species vary from parasitism to mutualism. The primate order {{is not well}} represented by studies on this subject, with scarce data concentrated on few species. This study is the first attempt to describe interactions between Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) and sika deer (Cervus nippon), in an area where no natural predators exist. Large quantities of food drop on the ground when Japanese macaques forage on the trees and deer were often observed to forage on this food items (i. e. gleaning). This observation may indicate that sika deer associated with Japanese macaque while feeding. Food quantity on a tree was the best predictor of this apparent feeding association. Yet, tree size, food quantity, and number of monkeys foraging on a tree significantly predicted the number of deer gleaning under that tree. Monkeys were rarely aggressive towards deer that were gleaning, although agonistic interactions among deer were frequently observed. Food dropped from the trees represents an additional, otherwise unavailable, source of energy for deer. Therefore, deer probably improved their foraging efficiency by gleaning. These results suggest that deer gain some benefits by this behaviour while they apparently do not inflict any costs to monkeys. As such, interactions between sika deer and Japanese macaques may represent a case of <b>commensalisms,</b> or of asymmetrical mutualism...|$|R
40|$|The {{community}} of microorganisms living in our intestine is ~ 10 times greater in num-ber {{than the total}} number of somatic and germ cells that compose our body. Our rela-tionship with colonizing gut microbes begins at birth. The specific constitution of this microbial community or microbiome varies between individuals and between the vari-ous regions of the gastrointestinal tract. The relationship between individual microbial species and the host ranges from <b>commensalisms</b> to mutualism to parasitism. Evidence increasingly confirms that the biology of gut bacteria and the human host including the motility of our gastrointestinal tract are inseparable. What happens when the balanced relationship between the human host and gut microbiota is disturbed? Recent evidence suggests that a shift in the host-gut microbial relationship as exemplified by small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may contribute to the pathogenesis of IBS. The results of two prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled studies using nonabsorbable antibiotics suggest that an antibiotic sensitive mechanism located in the small intestine is responsible for bloating and other symptoms of IBS. A 75 % global symptomatic improvement was reported by IBS patients when abnormal bacte-rial fermentation suggesting SIBO was eliminated. Small intestinal bacterial over-growth would be the best explanation for such a mechanism. Methane, a gaseous byproduct of microbial fermentation slows transit and is associated with constipation. These findings argue for the role of gut microbes in gastrointestinal motility disorders and the need for new diagnostic and treatment approaches directed at small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

Little {{is known about the}} carriage of C. albicans in the digestive tract and the genome dynamics that occur during <b>commensalisms</b> of this diploid species. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the prevalence, diversity, and genetic relationships among C. albicans isolates recovered during natural colonization of the digestive tract of humans, with emphasis on Crohn's disease patients who produce anti-yeast antibodies and may have altered Candida sp. carriage. Candida sp. isolates were recovered from 234 subjects within 25 families with multiple cases of Crohn's disease and 10 control families, sampled at the oral and fecal sites. Prevalences of Candida sp. and C. albicans carriage were 53. 4 % and 46. 5 %, respectively, indicating frequent commensal carriage. No differences in prevalence of carriage could be observed between Crohn's disease patients and healthy subjects. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of C. albicans isolates revealed frequent colonization of a subject or several members of the same family by genetically indistinguishable or genetically close isolates. These latter isolates differed by loss-of-heterozygosity events at one or several of the MLST loci. These loss-of-heterozygosity events could be due to either chromosome loss followed by duplication or large mitotic recombination events between complementary chromosomes. This study was the first to jointly assess commensal carriage of C. albicans, intrafamilial transmission, and microevolution. The high frequency of each of these events suggests that the digestive tract provides an important and natural niche for microevolutions of diploid C. albicans through the loss of heterozygosity...|$|R
2500|$|Symbiosis {{refers to}} two or more {{biological}} species that interact closely, often {{over a long period}} of time. Symbiosis includes three types of interactions—mutualism, <b>commensalism,</b> and parasitism—of which only mutualism can sometimes qualify as cooperation.

The observations began at 06. 00 until 18. 00. Daily activities recorded were resting, moving, feeding and drinking. Data analysis was done through arrangement of an ethogram to show daily activity and the time budget, and descriptive analysis to portray daily activity and interaction between banteng and deer. The results show that {{there are differences in}} the time used for resting and feeding between banteng and deer. Banteng used feeding ground more for resting (93, 2 %) and moving (5, 7 %).

40|$|International {{audience}} 60 % of the world's {{ecosystems are}} not used in a sustainable way. Modern agriculture is blamed for declining soil carbon and biodiversity. Climate change, habitat fragmentation and other obstacles impede the movement of many animal species, and distribution changes are projected to continue. Therefore, we need alternative management strategies. The colony organisation of social insects, especially of ants, {{is seen as a}} model to design an improved agricultural management, because ants are very experienced agriculturists. Ants represent half of the global insect biomass. Their individuals work like a super organism. This article focuses on harvester and leaf cutter ants by considering Lasius species. It reviews the organisation structure of social ant communities. Harvester and leaf cutter ants represent a high percentage of the worldwide ant societies. They collect plant saps with carbon nitrogen (C/N) ratios of about 40 for their own nourishment and leaf fragments with C/N ratios of about 100 for fungi gardens and brood nourishment. They sustain huge numbers of individuals with their low N-based organic imports and their colony <b>commensalisms</b> enable them to convert these polymers into lower molecular, partly volatile compounds, adenosinetriphosphate (ATP), and heat. Digging improves water infiltration, drainage and soil aeration. Ants maintain fungi as a food source for the scleroproteinous brood, carry out food preservation, infection control and waste management, and construct with endurance new nests and rebuild them after damage. All these activities move the nest sites far away from the thermodynamic equilibrium. Physical, chemical and biological gradients emerge and the growing populations, together with nest-penetrating mycorrhized plant roots, absorb the released nutrients and form biomass by lowering energy flows into potentially strong consumer-resource interactions or runaway consumptions. The plant material import of leaf cutter ants, rich in carbon but low in proteins, amounts to 85 - 470 kg dry weight per year. It keeps the electron donor/acceptor ratio in favour of the electron donor so that denitrifiers can reduce nitrate predominantly to N 2. Ants living in highly N-polluted areas bind the pollutant in the cuticle. In their low N-input environments harvester, leaf cutter and honeydew-sucking ants furnish the N demand of adult ants with the help of N 2 -fixing bacteria. The low N-input management of harvester, leaf cutter and honeydew-sucking ants is therefore a resourceful concept for approaching a highly productive agriculture by avoiding soil carbon decline and N 2 O emissions increase...|$|R

From this perspective, animal domestication is a coevolutionary process in which a population responds to selective pressure while adapting to a novel niche that included another species with evolving behaviors.|$|E
6000|$|Ingenious! {{would be}} my comment, and {{possibly}} to the eighteenth century mind it would have proved satisfactory. There was {{something to be said}} in defence of what appeared to him as new and strange in our books and methods. Not easily said, unfortunately; since it was not only the expression that was new, but the outlook, and something in the heart. We are bound as much as ever to facts; we seek for them more and more diligently, knowing that to break from them is to be carried away by vain imaginations. All the same, facts in themselves are nothing to us: they are important only in their relations to other facts and things--to all things, and the essence of things, material and spiritual. We are not like children gathering painted shells and pebbles on a beach; but, whether we know it or not, are seeking after something beyond and above knowledge. The wilderness in which we are sojourners is not our home; it is enough that its herbs and roots and wild fruits nourish and give us strength to go onward. Intellectual curiosity, with the gratification of the individual for only purpose, has no place in this scheme of things as we conceive it. Heart and soul are with the brain in all investigation--a truth which some know in rare, beautiful intervals, and others never; but we are all meanwhile busy with our work, like myriads of social insects engaged in raising a structure that was never planned. Perhaps we are not so wholly unconscious of our destinies as were the patient gatherers of facts of a hundred years ago. Even in one brief century the dawn has come nearer--perhaps a faint whiteness in the east has exhilarated us like wine. Undoubtedly we are more conscious of many things, both within and without--of the length and breadth and depth of nature; of a unity which was hardly dreamed of by the naturalists of past ages, a <b>commensalism</b> on earth from which the meanest organism is not excluded. For we are no longer isolated, standing like starry visitors on a mountain-top, surveying life from the outside; but are on a level with and part and parcel of it; and if the mystery of life daily deepens, it is because we view it more closely and with clearer vision. A poet of our age has said that in the meanest floweret we may find [...] "thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears." [...] The poet and prophet is not alone in this; he expresses a feeling common to all of those who, with our wider knowledge, have the passion for nature in their hearts, who go to nature, whether for knowledge or inspiration. That there should appear in recent literature something of a new spirit, a sympathetic feeling which could not possibly have flourished in a former age, is not to be wondered at, considering all that has happened in the present century to change the current of men's thoughts. For not only has the new knowledge wrought in our minds, but has entered, or is at last entering, into our souls.|$|E

40|$|The lack of {{fundamental}} biological {{information on the}} honey badger Mellivora capensis and its vulnerable conservation status were the motivating factors behind this study. A study population of 25 individuals (12 females; 12 males) was radio-marked in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (KTP), South Africa. Through a combination of radio telemetry and visual observations (5 244 h) of nine habituated individuals (five females; four males), the feeding ecology, scent marking and social behaviour of the honey badger were investigated. The honey badger is a solitary, generalist carnivore with strong seasonal differences in diet. In support of optimal diet theory, the cold dry season diet is characterized by low species richness, low foraging yield, high dietary diversity and increased foraging time while {{the reverse is true}} in the hot wet and hot-dry seasons. The honey badger appears to shift between alternative prey species depending on their availability on a seasonal and daily level. The daily activity patterns of both sexes show a strong seasonal shift from predominantly nocturnal activity in the hot-wet and hot-dry season to more diurnal activity in the cold-dry season and this appears to be primarily affected by temperature. Despite marked sexual size dimorphism (males a third larger than females), no intersexual differences in diet or foraging behaviour were observed, but there were sexual and in males age-related differences in movement patterns, scent marking and social behaviour. The honey badger appears to have a polygynous or promiscuous mating system, but did not fit the general mustelid pattern of intrasexual territoriality. Instead, adult males had extensive overlapping home ranges (548 km 2) that encompassed the smaller, regularly spaced home ranges of the females (138 km 2) and young males (178 km 2). Receptive females are an unpredictable and scare resource in space (large home ranges) and time (no breeding season) with a long time to renewal (inter-birth interval > 1 year). As a result adult males adopt a roaming rather than a staying tactic with competition for access to the mating burrow mediated by a dominance hierarchy loosely based on age, mass and testes size. The hierarchy appears to be maintained through regular aggressive and agonistic interactions and scent marking. Data suggest that latrine scent marking in adult males is related to advertising social status and maintaining the dominance hierarchy though “scent matching”. In females and young males latrine visits are rare, but token urination is common and its association with foraging behaviour suggests that it mediates spatio-temporal separation and/or resource utilization. Interspecific interactions between the honey badger and other mammalian and avian predators were common and included intraguild predation and interspecific feeding associations between the honey badger and seven other species (two mammals; five birds). The most common foraging associations were observed between the honey badger and the pale chanting-goshawk Melierax canorus and black-backed jackal Canis mesomelas. These associations appear to be <b>commensalisms,</b> with associating species benefiting from increased hunting opportunities and intake rate but no significant costs or benefits to the honey badger.
