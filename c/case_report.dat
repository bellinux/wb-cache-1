5|$|The pinnae have {{an effect}} on facial appearance. In Western societies, {{protruding}} ears (present in about 5% of ethnic Europeans) have been considered unattractive, particularly if asymmetric. The first surgery to reduce the projection of prominent ears was published in the medical literature by Ernst Dieffenbach in 1845, and the first <b>case</b> <b>report</b> in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Bone marrow suppression, {{characterized}} {{particularly by}} thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), may occur during linezolid treatment; {{it appears to}} be the only adverse effect that occurs significantly more frequently with linezolid than with glycopeptides or beta-lactams. It is uncommon in patients who receive the drug for 14 days or fewer, but occurs much more frequently in patients who receive longer courses or who have renal failure. A 2004 <b>case</b> <b>report</b> suggested that pyridoxine (a form of vitamin B6) could reverse the anemia and thrombocytopenia caused by linezolid, but a later, larger study found no protective effect.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{international}} journals {{will publish}} <b>case</b> <b>reports,</b> but they restrict {{the number that}} appear in the print run because this has an adverse effect on the journal's impact factor. <b>Case</b> <b>reports</b> are often put in the internet part of the journal and there is often still a requirement for a subscription to access them. However, {{there are a few}} that are devoted to publishing <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> alone, and these are all open access. The first of these to start publishing, in 2001, was Grand Rounds. Other similar journals include <b>Case</b> <b>Reports</b> in Medicine, Journal of Medical <b>Case</b> <b>Reports,</b> Oncology Reports, Oncology Letters and Cases Journal; all of them publish peer-reviewed <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> in all areas of medicine. Cases Journal recently merged with the Journal of Medical <b>Case</b> <b>Reports</b> but still maintains an independent internet portal. BMJ <b>Case</b> <b>Reports</b> is an online, peer-reviewed journal publishing cases in all disciplines. Radiology <b>Case</b> <b>Reports</b> and the Journal of Radiology <b>Case</b> <b>Reports</b> are open-access peer-reviewed journals focusing on medical imaging. Journal Of Surgical <b>Case</b> <b>Reports</b> is an open access peer-reviewed journal that considers <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> in the field of surgery. Journal of Orthopaedic <b>Case</b> <b>Reports</b> is an open access, peer-reviewed journal. Oncology Reports and Oncology Letters both publish <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> exclusively as open access, peer-reviewed journals in the field of oncology and cancer medicine. Human Pathology: <b>Case</b> <b>Reports</b> [...] is an open access, peer-reviewed journal publishing all aspects of pathology, regardless of the system affected.|$|R

It is without question that <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> do not replace well designed randomized clinical trials in advancing medical knowledge about cancerous diseases.

5000|$|<b>Case</b> <b>reports</b> are {{descriptions}} of clinical cases of rare phenomenon {{or a new}} clinical method. <b>Case</b> <b>reports</b> may be of value in assessing unusual medical conditions that cannot be studied in clinical trials.

40|$|Because {{they do not}} rank highly in the {{hierarchy}} of evidence and are not frequently cited, <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> describing the clinical circumstances of single patients are seldom published by medical journals.

Over the last several years, a vast number (~ 160) of new peer-reviewed journals have emerged that focus on publishing <b>case</b> <b>reports.</b> These journals are typically open access and have relatively high acceptance rates. However, approximately half of the publishers of <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> journals engage in questionable or ‘‘predatory’’ publishing practices.

30|$|Many {{biomedical}} journals tend to frown upon <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> and, if published at all, often {{consider this}} section of the journal as a dustbin for papers of secondary importance. The Editorial Board of Gynecological Surgery, however, intends to promote and value the publication of <b>case</b> <b>reports.</b> Indeed, <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> on surgery are of major scientific value to the medical profession for a number of reasons. First, the publication of <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> is indispensable for and supplementary to evidence-based medicine, as it generates hypotheses that may be studied consecutively in higher level of evidence designs. Secondly, the vast majority of reports are written by junior doctors, often attempting {{for the first time in}} their career to distil the scientific or medical significance of their observations and to share these with their peers. When the work is of outstanding quality and conform to strict criteria, such reports deserve to be published in the foremost international journals. Thirdly, <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> contribute to innovation and expansion of surgical knowledge. This Journal has longstanding tradition of publishing <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> and it is a pleasant surprise to find that, in a continuous series of 55 <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> in Gynecological Surgery, six (11 %) claimed to be the “first ever” report. These publications originated from UK, Turkey, and Denmark and described either a new surgical approach or hitherto unrecognized surgical events or complications. Fourthly, 60 % of <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> were illustrated, which demonstrate their potential value for medical education. Fifthly, the scientific value of <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> is further illustrated by the fact this section, corrected for the number of pages, is cited as frequently as the review section or the section with original articles. Finally, <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> remain an invaluable source of information for the management of cases with unexpected or unusual presentation or rare surgical complications.|$|R

40|$|Gender bias {{in medical}} {{journals}} {{can affect the}} science and the benefit to patients. It has never been investigated in clinical <b>case</b> <b>reports.</b> The oversight is important because of the role clinical <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> play in hypothesis generation and medical education. We investigated contemporary gender bias in <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> for the highest ranked journals in general and internal medicine. PubMed <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> data from 2011 to 2016 were extracted for the Annals of Internal Medicine, British Medical Journal, the Journal of the American Medical Association, The Lancet, and New England Journal of Medicine. The gender of the patients were identified and a text analysis of the Medical Subject Headings conducted. A total of 2, 742 <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> were downloaded and 2, 582 (95. 6 %) reports contributed to the final analysis. A pooled analysis showed a statistically significant gender bias against female <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> (0. 45; 95 %CI: 0. 43 - 0. 47). The Annals of Internal Medicine was the only journal with a point estimate (non significant) {{in the direction of}} a bias against male patients. The text analysis identified no substantive difference in the focus of the <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> and no obvious explanation for the bias. Gender bias, previously identified in clinical research and in clinical authorship, extends into the patients presented in clinical <b>case</b> <b>reports.</b> Whether it is driven by authors or editors is not clear, but it likely contributes to and supports an overall male bias of clinical medicine...|$|R
