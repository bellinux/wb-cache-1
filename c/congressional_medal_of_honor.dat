25|$|Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Penn Warren used York as {{the model}} for {{characters}} in two of his novels, both explorations of the burden of fame faced by battlefield heroes in peacetime.

Others exploit his decency and fame for their own selfish ends as the novel explores the real-life experience of an old-fashioned hero in a cynical world. In The Cave (1959), a similar hero from a comparable background has aged and become an invalid. He struggles to maintain his identity as his real self diverges from the robust legend of his youth.|$|E
