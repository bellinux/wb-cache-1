5|$|Crested newts {{are dark}} brown, with black {{spots on the}} sides, and white {{stippling}} in some species. Their belly is yellow to orange with black blotches, forming a pattern characteristic for individuals. Females and juveniles of some species have a yellow line running down their back and tail. During breeding phase, crested newts <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>appearance,</b> most markedly the males. These develop a skin seam running along their back and tail; this crest is the namesake feature of the crested newts and can be up to 1.5cm high and very jagged in the northern crested newt. Another feature of males at breeding time is a silvery-white band {{along the sides of}} the tail.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between experiencing major stress events (MSEs) and <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>appearance</b> (CAs) was studied {{in a sample}} of 128 participants. All participants completed the Major Stress Event and <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>Appearance</b> Inventory. Results indicated a significant correlation between experiencing MSEs and considered or actual CAs (r =. 50 p <. 01). Scores on the <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>Appearance</b> Inventory were significantly higher in groups with moderate to high scores on the Major Stress Event scale. This {{relationship between}} MSEs and CAs was affected by age but not gender. These results suggest that stressful life events may prompt body image dissatisfaction and underlie motivations for <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> body <b>appearance</b> to promote self-image. Successive or dramatic appearance changes may be an important signal of stressful experiences...|$|R

5|$|In 1992, Audouin Dollfus of the Observatoire de Paris {{reported}} anomalous {{features on}} the floor of Langrenus crater using a one-meter (3.2-foot) telescope. While observations on the night of December 29, 1992, were normal, unusually high albedo and polarization features were recorded the following night that did not <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>appearance</b> over the six minutes of data collection. Observations three days later showed a similar, but smaller, anomaly in the same vicinity. While the viewing conditions for this region were close to specular, it was argued that the amplitude of the observations were not consistent with a specular reflection of sunlight. The favored hypothesis was that this was the consequence of light scattering from clouds of airborne particles resulting from a release of gas. The fractured floor of this crater was cited as a possible source of the gas.|$|E

25|$|The GM's {{merger with}} the Alton Railroad in 1947 brought several {{changes to the}} Gulf Coast Rebel.

In addition, the train received new lightweight cars built by American Car and Foundry. Both the Little and Big Rebels were {{the victim of the}} worsening passenger market in the 1950s. The GM discontinued the original Rebels in 1954 and the Gulf Coast Rebel, its last passenger train south of St. Louis, in 1958.|$|E

25|$|There is an {{alternate}} strategy for identifying fit mates {{which does not}} rely on one gender having exaggerated sexual ornaments or other handicaps, but is probably generally applicable to most, if not all sexual creatures. It derives from the concept that the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>appearance</b> and functionality caused by a non-silent mutation will generally stand out in a population. This is because that altered appearance and functionality will be unusual, peculiar, and different from the norm within that population. The norm against which these unusual features are judged {{is made up of}} fit attributes that have attained their plurality through natural selection, while less well adapted attributes will be in the minority or frankly rare. Since the overwhelming majority of mutant features are maladaptive, and it is impossible to predict evolution's future direction, sexual creatures would be expected to prefer mates with the least number of unusual or minority features. This will have the effect of a sexual population rapidly shedding peripheral phenotypic features, thereby canalizing the entire outward appearance and behavior of all of its members. They will all very quickly begin to look remarkably similar to one another in every detail, as illustrated in the accompanying photograph of the African pygmy kingfisher, Ispidina picta. Once a population has become as homogeneous in appearance as is typical of most species, its entire repertoire of behaviors will also be rendered evolutionarily stable, including any cooperative, altruistic and social interactions. Thus, in the example above of the selfish individual who hangs back {{from the rest of the}} hunting pack, but who nevertheless joins in the spoils, that individual will be recognized as being different from the norm, and will therefore find it difficult to attract a mate. Its genes will therefore have only a very small probability of being passed on to the next generation, thus evolutionarily stabilizing cooperation and social interactions at whatever level of complexity is the norm in that population.|$|E

500|$|Kryten, {{full name}} Kryten 2X4B-523P (played by Robert Llewellyn from series III onwards, {{and as a}} one-off {{appearance}} in series II by David Ross), was rescued by the crew from the crashed spaceship Nova 5 in series II, upon which he had continued to serve the ship's crew despite their having been dead for thousands or even millions of years. Kryten is a Service Mechanoid and when first encountered by the crew, he was bound by his [...] "behavioural protocols", but Lister gradually encouraged him to break his programming and think for himself. His <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>appearance</b> between the two actors is explained away by an accident involving Lister's spacebike and Lister having to repair him.|$|E

Holly has a {{functional}} IQ of 6000, {{although this is}} severely depleted by the three million years of runtime and lack of repairs. Holly is left alone after the radiation accident that kills Rimmer {{and the rest of}} the crew except for Lister and the Cat. The computer had developed [...] "computer senility" [...] before the radiation accident, rendering it functionally inert. The <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>appearance</b> for series III is explained by Holly having changed his face to resemble that of a computer from a parallel universe [...] "with whom he'd once fallen madly in love".|$|E
500|$|In a {{developing}} cyclone, the technique {{takes advantage of}} the fact that cyclones of similar intensity tend to have certain characteristic features, and as they strengthen, they tend to <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>appearance</b> in a predictable manner. [...] The structure and organization of the tropical cyclone are tracked over 24hours to determine if the storm has weakened, maintained its intensity, or strengthened. [...] Various central cloud and banding features are compared with templates that show typical storm patterns and their associated intensity. [...] If infrared satellite imagery is available for a cyclone with a visible eye pattern, then the technique utilizes the difference between the temperature of the warm eye and the surrounding cold cloud tops to determine intensity (colder cloud tops generally indicate a more intense storm). In each case a [...] "T-number" [...] (an abbreviation for Tropical Number) and a Current Intensity (CI) value are assigned to the storm. These measurements range between 1 (minimum intensity) and 8 (maximum intensity). The T-number and CI value are the same except for weakening storms, in which case the CI is higher. [...] For weakening systems, the CI is held as the tropical cyclone intensity for 12hours, though research from the National Hurricane Center indicates that six hours is more reasonable. [...] The table at right shows the approximate surface wind speed and sea level pressure that corresponds to a given T-number. [...] The amount a tropical cyclone can change in strength per 24‑hour period is limited to 2.5T-numbers per day.|$|E

Although they previously dyed their hair in various colors (from purple to silver), in Brand New they stopped completely, leaving their hair in either brown or black.

2500|$|Two tornadoes {{that look}} {{almost exactly the}} same can produce {{drastically}} different effects. Also, two tornadoes which look very different can produce similar damage.
