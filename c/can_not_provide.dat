25|$|Because {{of limited}} spatial and {{temporal}} resolution fMRS <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>provide</b> information about metabolites in different cell types, for example, whether lactate is used by neurons or by astrocytes during brain activation. The smallest volume that can currently be characterized with fMRS is 1cm3, which is too big to measure metabolites in different cell types. To overcome this limitation, mathematical and kinetic modeling is used.|$|E

Kimahri's difficulties as chief comprise several playable missions, most notably involving a disagreement he has with a young Ronso named Garik, who desires to seek vengeance upon the Guado for the Ronsos killed by Seymour in the previous game as well as find two Ronso children, Lian and Ayde, who are in search of adventure {{and a way to}} fix Kimahri's broken horn. Eventually, Kimahri realizes that all Ronso should follow the example of Lian and Ayde in trying to find their own individual paths while working together to forge a better future for one another, and that he alone <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>provide</b> a single answer to what the future of the entire group should be.|$|E

2500|$|In pain {{research}} fMRS complements fMRI and PET techniques. Although fMRI and PET are continuously used {{to localize}} pain processing {{areas in the}} brain, they <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>provide</b> direct information about changes in metabolites during pain processing that could help to understand physiological processes behind pain perception and potentially lead to novel treatments for pain. fMRS overcomes this limitation and {{has been used to}} study pain-induced (cold-pressure, heat, dental pain) neurotransmitter level changes in the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insular cortex [...] and left insular cortex. These fMRS studies are valuable because they show that some or all Glx compounds (glutamate, GABA and glutamine) increase during painful stimuli in the studied brain regions.|$|E
