The dosis of vitamin B(1) and B(2) in urine for one day had relation to the severity of disease and the excreted dosis of visamin B(1) and B(2) into urine decreased with severe case. 2. The decrease of the excreted dosis of pyro-racemic acid in urine was observed on the 30 cases of 40 cases with the intravenous injection of 20 % glucose 0. 1 cc per kg and it was observed on the 20 cases of 40 cases with the administration of 20 % glucose 0. 2 cc per kg. In other words, glucose activated the disposal function of Pyro-racemic acid in some degree. And at that time, the considerable correlation between the severity of disease and the above function was observed, but it had no relation with cavity, excretion of bacillus, erythrocyte sedimentation rate liver function or subjective symptoms. 3. Giving vitamin B(1) 5 mg at 1 hour before the administration of 20 % glucose 0. 2 cc per kg, the decrease of pyroracemic acid was observed on the 6 cases of 20 cases which did not show the decrease or pyro-racemic acid, and it was shown in the 4 more cases {{on the use of}} <b>cocarboxylase</b> 5 mg instead of vitamin B(1).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to {{investigate}} the functional, histological and metabolic changes of cord bladder in the acute stadium of spinal injury. Spinal injury was produced on rabbits at the level of L 5 by means of a new simple technique. Cystometrogram, histological findings of the bladder wall, histochemical activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH, modified method of Nachlas, Seligman et al.), that of phosphorylase (PhR, Takeuchi and Kuriaki's method) and chemical activity of phosphorylase (cPhR, medified method of Sutherland) in the bladder smooth muscle were observed both in normal and cord-injured rabbits, in the latter 5 days after the injury. Furthermore, the effects of atropine (0. 15 mg/kg), bethanechol (0. 8 mg/kg), and <b>cocarboxylase</b> (3 mg/kg) on the above mentioned examinations were observed. The following results were obtained. 1) In normal rabbits, the maximum voiding capacity (MVC) was 62. 7 ± 9. 4 ml and the maximum voiding pressure 33. 1 ± 1. 3 mmHg. In the bladder wall of normal rabbits, smooth muscle had PAS positive substance, SDH was weakly positive, PhR was stronger in the muscle than in the mucosa and cPhR was 5. 4 ± 1. 1. 2) The cystometorogram on the 5 th day after injury showed hypotonic curves, increased MVC and decreased MVP, but did not show any autonomous waves. Histological examination revealed deformity, atrophy and ablation in the mucosa, edema, hemorrhage, proliferation of connective tissue and atrophy of the muscle layer. SDH and PhR were decreased and cPhR was 3. 0 ± 0. 7. 3) After a single injection in normal rabbits, MVC was remarkably decreased by bethanechol and not changed by atropine, but the effect of <b>cocarboxylase</b> on MVC was indefinite, On the other hand, MVP was decreased by atropine, but effects of bethanechol and <b>cocarboxylase</b> were indefinite. The drugs had no effect on histological findings and enzyme activity in the normal bladder. After daily injection for 18 to 20 days, there was also no difference either in histological or histochemical findings by bethanechol and <b>cocarboxylase,</b> but by atropine, there was weak edema in the muscle layer, and SDH, PhR and cPhR were decreased. 4) Bethanechol in the daily doses of 0. 8 mg/kg, which was not fatal to normal rabbits even after 20 days of daily injections, killed cord-injuried animals within 3 days after the beginning of daily injections. On the other hand, the half doses of bethanechol given to cordinjured animals showed a tendency to increase MVP and irregular waves in the cystometrogram. MVC remained unchanged. Histologically, there was no favorable influence of bethanechol; and moreover, it exhibited tendencies to decrease SDH, PhR and cPhR when compared with cord-injured animals which were given no drug. <b>Cocarboxylase</b> presented a tendency to repress the changes produced in the bladder by cord injury such as the increase in MVC, the decrease in SDH, PhR and cPhR or the appearance of muscle atrophy. The author concluded from the experiments described above that because the bladder smooth muscle has fallen into dysfunction and metabolic disturbances, the administration of <b>cocarboxylase</b> is useful for neurogenic bladder in the acute stadium, but bethanechol is not only insignificant but even harmful to function of the bladder in this stadium...|$|E

The method of supplying energy to the system had a profound influence on the drying rate and on the internal temperature of the samples during drying. The drying time of (S) -N-acetylindoline- 2 -carboxylic acid (1 b) with the low moisture content (5 wt %) could be reduced by a factor 4 using microwave irradiation instead of conventional heating, while keeping the sample temperature under 35 °C. N-Acetyl-(S) -phenylalanine (2) with a higher moisture content (22 wt %) demonstrated a decrease in drying time by a factor 2. 5 to 4 depending on the applied microwave powers. A reduction in drying time of the precipitated (S) -N-acetylindoline- 2 -carboxylic acid (1 a, 17 wt % moisture) by a factor 2 was demonstrated for drying at 150 W of microwave irradiation instead of using a water bath at 70 °C. A dramatically shorter drying time by a factor 10 was found for <b>cocarboxylase</b> hydrochloride (3, 15 wt % water) on lab-scale which could be reproduced on pilot-plant scale. To achieve with conventional heating similar drying times as under microwave irradiation for the four examples, extremely high energy inputs should be applied, necessitating extremely high temperature differences between the heating source and the sample.

This paper describes the separation of these four enzyme activities and some of their properties. METHODS Assays. Benzoylformic carboxylase was assayed manometrically by measuring the rate of carbon dioxide evolution from benzoylformic acid at pH 6. 0 and 30 C. The test system contained 100 ug of <b>cocarboxylase,</b> 50 iM of sodium benzoyl-formate, and phosphate buffer (0. 1 M, pH 6. 0) sufficient to give a total volume of 2. 5 ml. Measurements were usually made in air, but crude extracts still containing the particle frac-tion were assayed in nitrogen to preclude oxida-tion of the benzaldehyde formed. The rate of decarboxylation is a linear function of enzyme concentration over the measurable range. The unit of activity is defined as the amount of en-zyme which decarboxylates one micromole of benzoylformic acid per hour under the specified conditions.

It will be concluded that the protecting treatment of liver function is also useful not only for elevation of the value of vitamin B(1) in blood but also for the improvement of general symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} various {{concentrations}} of dithiothreitol, molecular oxygen, and several antioxidants upon the in vitro replication of Treponema pallidum were studied. The optimal dithiothreitol concentration was between 0. 65 and 1. 62 mM, and the optimum oxygen concentration was 3. 0 % +/- 0. 5 % {{in both the}} presence and absence of additional antioxidants. It was discovered that the reduced sulfhydryl concentration and the oxidation-reduction potential of the medium were stabilized after 5 days. The water-soluble antioxidants cobalt chloride, <b>cocarboxylase,</b> mannitol, and histidine were individually tested {{for their ability to}} increase treponemal growth in vitro. The optimum concentrations for these antioxidants were 21 nM, 4. 3 nM, 0. 55 mM, and 0. 23 mM, respectively. When combined at these concentrations, the mixture of antioxidants stimulated the in vitro replication of T. pallidum. The number of treponemes in cultures with the antioxidants averaged a 59 -fold increase, compared with a 43 -fold increase in cultures lacking the antioxidants. It was further demonstrated that histidine and mannitol were the most critical components of this mixture. Catalase and superoxide dismutase were investigated for their ability to promote the growth and maintain viability of T. pallidum in tissue culture. The optimum concentrations for these enzymes were 10, 000 U/liter and 25, 000 U/liter, respectively. When these enzymes and the above antioxidants were combined and added to a chemically reduced modified Eagle medium, the treponemes increased an average of 70 -fold, compared with an average of 35 -fold in cultures lacking them. Furthermore, this medium, T. pallidum culture medium, supported the replication of T. pallidum at oxygen concentrations from 5 to 7 % with little loss in yield or viability. The lipid-soluble antioxidants vitamin A and vitamin E acetate were also shown to enhance the in vitro growth of T. pallidum in this medium...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolic}} {{changes in}} the homografted canine heart were studied in order to define the biochemical alterations accompanying homograft rejection. In several experiments, homograft rejection was accelerated by prior sensitization of the host animal. The homografted heart released pyruvate and lactate as well as malic dehydrogenase and aldolase. Extraction of glucose by the graft usually remained positive. During the accelerated rejection, the release of pyruvate and lactate was more pronounced, and even glucose appeared in increased concentrations in coronary vein blood. In many experiments the respiratory quotient of the transplanted heart {{as well as its}} glucose-oxygen extraction ratio were elevated. It seemed likely that the elevated respiratory quotients were the result of conversion of carbohydrates to fat, since the injection of thiamine hydrochloride resulted in further elevation of the respiratory quotient and in an increased myocardial pyruvate extraction. Apparently, thiamine corrected a metabolic block {{at the level of the}} <b>cocarboxylase.</b> The metabolic block or blocks present in the transplanted heart are likely to be the result of diminution in intracellular enzymes and coenzymes resulting from increased cellular permeability. The redox potential across the transplanted heart was positive, indicating the absence of anoxia. The results illustrate that glycolysis proceeds in the transplanted heart in the presence of oxygen. Histopathologic and histochemical studies show the earliest lesion to be an accumulation of lymphocytes around vessels at 3 hours. Swelling of vascular endothelium occurs. By 5 hours a polar perivascular cellular infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and histiocytes exists. Changes following at 19 hours show the appearance of Aschoff- and Anitschkow-like cells. Granulomatous myocarditis which was first perivascular became interstitial with lymphocytic and histiocytic invasion of the myocardium. After 8 days acceleration of swelling of vascular endothelium and granulomatous lesions were observed and necrosis of the myocardium was prominent. Endothelial hyperplasia occurred at 14 days. In the accelerated reaction these changes were intensified and necrosis began as early as 4 hours after grafting. Histochemical changes of DPNH diaphorase, lactic, malic, and succinic dehydrogenase showed only significant diminution of malic dehydrogenase in the cardiac muscle which was concurrent with the increase of this enzyme in the serum...|$|E
