500|$|On 16 September, Nominated Member of Parliament Eunice Olsen {{asked in}} Parliament {{if there was}} a {{difference}} in the amount of funding given to Olympians and Paralympians, and why Paralympians receive a much smaller cash reward for medals won compared to Olympians. Teo Ser Luck, Senior Parliamentary Secretary (Community Development, Youth and Sports), said that on a per capita basis disabled sportspeople received about S$106,000 in the <b>current</b> <b>financial</b> <b>year</b> compared to S$54,000 for each able-bodied sportsperson as there were 794registered able-bodied sportspeople but only 16disabled ones. Teo attributed the disparity in the cash rewards to the fact that Olympians faced higher levels and a larger scale of competition, since disabled sportspeople compete within disability classes. Further, cash rewards were provided by the private sector and Singapore Totalisator Board and were not paid out of state funds. The scheme for Olympians had also been in place for a number of years, while cash rewards for Paralympians were only introduced recently. He said that the government was looking at how it could [...] "develop a system to accommodate all athletes that represent Singapore".|$|E

40|$|While many {{organizations}} have successfully introduced Process Improvement (PI) methodologies, {{a number of}} those very same organizations struggle to integrate enterprise-wide Business Process Management (BPM) as they continue to focus on initiatives for the <b>current</b> and coming <b>financial</b> <b>years.</b> These organizations often find that after some period of time they are having difficulty even sustaining their improvement programs: Most of the “low hanging fruit ” has been picked and the current ways of doing business have still not markedly changed. Alternatively, it can take significant time and effort to integrate BPM as the “way we do business” in an organization. To maintain focus and momentum often requires the ability to implement some “quick wins ” to maintain interest in the longer-term BPM investment. This series of three articles explores the relationship between BPM and Process Improvement Methods and suggests that successful and sustainable Business Performance relies on having a holistic and phased approach that consciously includes both.

40|$|Inquiries {{about this}} {{document}} {{can be made}} to HARC@hawaii. edu Among all the factors influencing audit input, audit personnel {{is one of the most}} important, as each factor of audit input is directly related to competent and talented people. Using auditor salary as a proxy for audit personnel quality, I hypothesize and find that higher personnel quality leads to better audit output. First, clients of auditors paying higher salaries have higher audit quality, as evidenced by a lower likelihood of a future restatement of <b>current</b> <b>year’s</b> <b>financial</b> statements, lower discretionary accruals, and a lower likelihood to receive a failed internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) opinion. Moreover, higher-paid auditors earn higher audit fees and are more likely to become national and city-level leaders in a specific industry. The cross-sectional analysis finds that the positive effect of personnel quality on audit outcomes is more pronounced for the audit offices having a steady growth in industry market shares. Collectively, these results are consistent with higher-cost audit inputs leading to better audit output...|$|R
