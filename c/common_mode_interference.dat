For most motor designing process, it is always used to evaluate the inductance of windings in lower or working frequency; however, when analyzing the conducted interference, it is necessary to take some pa-rameters in high frequency into account in building up the EMC model, such as the noticeable capacitance distributed among the windings or between windings and shells. Past research neglected the common-mode current generated by the high frequency interference within motor bearings coupled with shells, since the parasitic capacitance of rotor core comes from armature windings supplied sufficient paths.

40|$|SUMMARY: Electromagnetic {{compatibility}} of myoelectrode amplifiers for prosthetic {{control is}} important for safe operation in electrically noisy conditions. Factors affecting susceptibility to interference (impedance, common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and isolation) were studied using a commercial amplifier. INTRODUCTION: Electrical interference can enter the system either directly between the active electrodes as a differential signal, or via the common electrode as a common mode signal. The direct path is susceptible to interference due to the high gain of the amplifier. Shielding and electrode geometry design can help reduce the effects. A notch filter is generally used to reduce greatly the amplifier gain at mains frequency, though harmonics are still passed. <b>Common</b> <b>mode</b> <b>interference</b> is mitigated by the normally very high CMRR of the amplifier; however, common mode signals can also be converted to differential signals through imbalances in electrode impedances (Winter and Webster, 1983; Scott and Lovely, 1986). <b>Common</b> <b>mode</b> <b>interference</b> mainly enters via the power and output leads of a myoelectrode amplifier, so effective isolation should reduce the effect. METHODS: Two Otto Bock 13 E 125 active myoelectrodes {{were used for the}} investigations. Sinusoidal signals of different frequencies were applied in differential and common mode configurations and the output measured. The myoelectrode and measuring equipment were all battery powered to avoid conductive mains interference. Connection to the electrode contacts was through an assembly of spring-loaded platinum contacts, and the myoelectrode was shielded from the external environment in a die-cast box. Measurements were made with different balanced and unbalanced input impedances to represent the skin interface. The measurements were made with the myoelectrode alone and also in combination with an isolation amplifier (Burr-Brown ISO 124), and a d. c. -d. c. converter (Murata MEA 1 D 0505 SC) to provide isolated power. RESULTS: The d. c. input impedance and intrinsic CMRR of the myoelectrode amplifier were extremely high by design (> 40 M? and > 90 dB). The response to differential signals was greatest at 200 Hz to 1 kHz, with a sharp notch at 50 Hz. The CMRR was significantly reduced for a. c. signals if the electrode impedances were unbalanced. As the amplifier gain was non-linear and frequency dependent, a protocol was followed where the imbalance in electrode impedances was adjusted to give the same output as a known differential input. Thus the effect of impedance imbalance could be separated from the intrinsic CMRR of the amplifier. The results obtained fitted the Winter-Webster model with input capacitances of 400 pF. The centre earth electrode was found to be strongly coupled to the 0 V lead at a. c. via a capacitance of 1 ?F. Isolating the amplifier improved the rejection of common mode signals introduced via the 0 V lead. There was a 20 dB increase in CMRR with the isolation components used. CONCLUSION: <b>Common</b> <b>mode</b> <b>interference</b> can enter via the leads of a myoelectrode amplifier. Even if the intrinsic CMRR of the amplifier is very high, common mode is converted to an interfering differential signal if the electrode impedances are unbalanced. This is very likely to be the case, due to differences in skin contact. It has been demonstrated that the common mode route can be blocked by an isolating amplifier and dc-dc converter, though at the expense of extra complexity and the need to power these components. Practical implementations may come from developments in low power circuitry for applications such as wireless sensor networks. REFERENCES: Winter B. and Webster J.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Displacement sensors are key {{components}} in the closed loop control of nanopositioning systems, producing repeatable motions with nanometer resolution. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) offer a miniaturised solution for implementing low cost and high speed nanopositioners with integrated sensors. Among the MEMS displacement sensing techniques, only the electrothermal and piezoresistive sensors can be implemented for this purpose within a reasonable footprint. The performance of the aforementioned sensors is severely influenced by their inherent high noise levels, which limits the displacement resolution of the MEMS nanopositioner. As such, this thesis presents several displacement sensing techniques to improve {{the performance of the}} MEMS nanopositioners. In the first approach, a readout circuit is presented to increase the sensitivity of the electrothermal sensors. The sensor is coupled to a ring oscillator power supply by a ratiometric interface in order to convert the small resistive changes (390 ~ 400 Ω) to the wide frequency variation (350 ~ 550 kHz). Subsequently, the frequency demodulator circuits are designed to produce a voltage output. The experiments are carried out on a 1 -Degree of Freedom (1 -DoF) nanopositioner with a thermal actuator. In addition to the high sensitivity achievement, the ring oscillator nonlinearity is designed to cancel the actuator nonlinearity to produce a linear input-output transfer function, which otherwise needs a lookup table for calibration and closed loop control. The MEMS sensors are fabricated in doped silicon that inherently generates the flicker and thermal noise. The second approach in this thesis consists of two distinct solutions to mitigate the noise contribution. The flicker noise is inversely proportional to the applied heating signal frequency. Hence, a new excitation and readout technique is presented to drive the sensor with a high frequency voltage. The experiments are successfully conducted on a 1 -DoF MEMS nanopositioner, which demonstrate an 8 dB flicker noise reduction, when compared to the conventional dc (direct current) excitation. In order to alleviate the thermal noise, a multiple sensor system is developed based on the averaging theory, according to which a combination of multiple independent signals contaminated with the uncorrelated noise results in a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The sensors are implemented around a 1 -DoF nanopositioner in order to produce independent measurements of the displacement in real time. The experimental results on three sensors demonstrate a 4 dB SNR enhancement, which is in close agreement with the theory. Electrothermal sensors can be operated in constant current (CC) or in constant voltage (CV) excitation modes. In the third approach, an analytic comparison of the two methods is presented. It is shown that from the SNR point of view, the benefits of operating a sensor in CC mode are only marginal. The analytical investigation is supported by experiments performed on sensors integrated into a silicon on insulator (SOI) MEMS nanopositioner with low noise read out circuits, which leads to a 0. 04 nm/√Hz displacement resolution for both excitation modes. A new 2 -Degree of Freedom (2 -DoF) MEMS nanopositioner with electrothermal sensors is also presented in this dissertation for the scanning stage of the atomic force microscope (AFM), which is a significant achievement towards the miniaturisation of low cost AFMs for high speed operation. The electrothermal sensors are integrated to the stage in order to provide displacement information for a feedback control loop, which should be otherwise provided by an external sensor, such as an interferometer. The images obtained by the controlled nanopositioner demonstrate a great quality enhancement compared to the open loop nanopositioner. Finally, a piezoresistive sensing technique is presented in this thesis as an alternative integrated small area solution. Compared to the existing piezoresistive sensors, it is fabricated in the standard SOI process without any customised fabrication step. The embedded sensor is designed and characterised for a 1 -DoF nanopositioner and exploits the differential architecture to achieve higher sensitivity, linearity and <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> <b>interference</b> rejection...|$|E

The use of earth mass on a proper place in the circuit can reduce the <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> voltage. Sinusoidal (sine-triangle) PWM scheme is being used for this purpose and simulation results are being presented in this paper by using software “Simplorer ” and “Post Processor Day”. Keyword...|$|R
40|$|IGBT based power {{converters}} acts as front {{end in the}} present day Adjustable Speed Drive (ASD). This offers many advantages and makes regenerative action possible. PWM rectifier operation produces electrically noisy DC bus on <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> basis. This results in higher ground current as compared to three phase diode bridge rectifier. Due to fast turn-ON and turn-OFF time of IGBT, the inverter output voltage dv/dt is high during switching transients and voltage waveform is rich in harmonics. As a result, in applications involving long cable the motor terminal voltage during the switching transient {{is as high as}} twice the applied voltage. This voltage stress reduces the life of insulation in motors. The high dv/dt output voltage applied at the motor terminal excites the parasitic capacitive coupling resulting in increased ground currents and causes Electric Discharge Machining (EDM) which reduces the life of motor bearings. The <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> voltage due to PWM rectifier and the inverter appear at the motor terminals exacerbating these problems. The <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> voltage due to PWM inverter with PWM rectifier is analyzed. An integrated approach for filter design is proposed wherein the adverse effects due to <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> voltage of both AFE converter and the inverter is addressed. The proposed topology addresses the problems of <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> voltage, <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> current and voltage doubling due to ASD. The design procedure for proposed filter topology is discussed with experimental results that validate the effectiveness of the filter. Inclusion of such higher order filter in the converter topology leads to problems such as resonance. Passive methods are investigated for damping the line resonance due to LCL filter and <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> resonance due to <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> filter. The need for active damping technique for resonance due to <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> filter is presented. State space based damping technique is proposed to effectively damp the resonance due to line filter and the <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> filter. Experimental results are presented that validate the effectiveness of active damping both on the line basis (differential mode) and line to ground basis (<b>common</b> <b>mode)</b> of the filter...|$|R
