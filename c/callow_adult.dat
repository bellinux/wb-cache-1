40|$|The large {{pine weevil}} Hylobius abietis is a serious pest of {{reforestation}} in northern Europe. Development {{takes place in the}} stumps of felled conifer trees and emerging adults feed on and kill newly planted trees. Application of entomopathogenic nematodes around tree stumps has been shown to reduce the emergence of adult weevils. In order to target application at the most susceptible stage, the susceptibility of larvae and pupae to Heterorhabditis downesi and Steinernema carpocapsae was compared in a close-contact assay on filter paper. An average of 95. 8 % of larvae were killed by H. downesi and 82. 1 % by S. carpocapsae while only 16. 3 and 15. 0 % of pupae were killed by these two species, respectively. However, many of the H. abietis that were exposed as pupae died after metamorphosis to <b>callow</b> <b>adult,</b> with mortality of pupae and callow adults combined reaching 62. 5 % for H. downesi and 69. 9 % for S. carpocapsae. For both nematode species significantly more insects died as larvae than as either pupae or pupae/callow adults. When pupae were exposed to infective juveniles (IJs) for 2 days and were then washed while still pupae to remove surface IJs, adults were later found to be infected indicating that IJs can infect pupae, survive metamorphosis and subsequently kill adults...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Six {{species of}} Cleridae, {{including}} Enoclerus spegeus Fabricius, E. lecontei Wolcott, E. schaefferi (Barr), E. eximius Mannerheim, Thanasimus undatulus Say, and an undescribed species of Enoclerus, {{were found on}} Douglas-fir in western Oregon. E. sphegeus was the only clerid of the six species studied which was primarily associated with the Douglas-fir beetle, as the other clerids occurred more often with Scolytus unispinosus or other small scolytids. E. sphegeus and T. undatulus each had a life span of two years, {{the first year of}} which was spent in the immature stages. E. sphegeus and T. undatulus adults emerged during {{the latter part of the}} summer, apparently overwintered in bark crevices, and appeared on Douglas-fir beetle-infested trees the following spring. Both species survived as adults approximately a year in the field, and E. sphegeus lived up to nearly a year and a half in the laboratory. E. lecontei adults emerged throughout the summer, survived no more than two months in the laboratory, and gave no indication of overwintering in the adult stage. Clerids mated frequently throughout their adult life. Mating appeared to be stimulated by a pheromone produced by the females. Two larval instars were found in E. sphegeus, three in T. undatulus, E. lecontei, and Enoclerus sp., and four in E. schaefferi, although none of the E. schaefferi larvae pupated. E. sphegeus larvae fed on all stages of Douglas-fir beetle brood during the first instar, and fed mostly on Douglas-fir beetles from the third instar to <b>callow</b> <b>adult</b> in the early part of the second instar. After the first few weeks, most second instar larvae did not feed, but left the Douglas-fir beetle galleries and remained relatively inactive throughout the winter and spring in pupal cells, constructed in the outer bark of infested trees or in chunks of partly decayed bark on the ground, until the following July or August when they pupated. A few prepupal larvae in the outer bark were parasitized by a species of Ichneumonidae. E. sphegeus adults apparently did not consume their potential of Douglas-fir beetles in the field due to lack of available Douglas-fir beetle adults throughout most of the year. E. sphegeus larvae were rather ineffective as predators, since they occurred mainly where Douglas-fir beetle gallery density was high, and merely reduced competition of Douglas-fir beetle brood rather than causing a decrease in the population...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The study (1) {{describes}} {{the life cycle}} of P. nebulosus, (2) examines stimuli that may cause the beetles to locate brood material, and (3) establishes the relationship between moisture stress in Douglas-fir and colonization by P. nebuZosus. and other meristem insects. (1) Development of P. nebulosus goes through the egg stage, three larval instars, and the pupal and <b>callow</b> <b>adult</b> stages. Teneral adults emerge from late spring through fall, disperse, and feed in tissues of live Douglas-fir twigs before attaining sexual maturity. Progeny initiated in early spring may become capable of reproduction and initiate colonization of susceptible host material in fall. P. nebulosus overwinters in all stages except the egg and pupal stages, hibernating in feeding tunnels or galleries of newly colonized breeding sites. The main breeding period is the early spring. Females begin gallery construction. (2) The flight of immature beetles is governed by temperature, but is induced by light and appears primarily oriented toward light. Positive photic response appears to overpower response to vegetative stimuli. Temperature induces a reversal in the beetle's photic response at two thresholds (15. 5 °C and 34 °C). Decrease of light intensity to 17 f. c. induces a light negative and thigmotactic response. Two temperatures (19 °C and 34 °C) limit the range for flight take-off, which occurs only under conditions inducing positive phototropism in the beetle. Field tests failed to attract flying immature beetles to materials known as highly attractive to mature beetles. In laboratory tests, walking beetles responded to ethanol vapors in darkness but were unresponsive in the light. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the beetles alight into Douglas-fir crowns by chance and respond to feeding stimuli under condition-favoring negative phototaxis and thigmotaxis. The flight of mature P. nebulosus differs from the flight of immature beetles primarily in orientation. Field tests showed strong response by mature P. nebulosus to fresh Douglas-fir twigs and stem sections as well as to certain monoterpene solutions and ethanol. Ethanol was also attractive to Pseudohylesinus grandis Sw.; Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopk.; Hy 1 astes nigrinus (Mann); Gnathotriohus spp.; Trypodondron linoatum Oliver; and Anisandrus pyri (Peck). This suggests the possibility that ethanol is a constituent of primary host-attraction also to other scolytids besides timber beetles as suggested by others. The bimodal flight pattern of mature P. nebulosus and its possible causes are discussed. It is possible that trees under midday moisture deficits may become a temporary attraction source and 'absorb' part of the airborne population. (3) Diurnal and seasonal changes in moisture relations of Douglas-fir were determined by Scholander's pressure chamber technique of measuring plant moisture stress (PMS) in vascular plants. The ecological interpretation of PMS, determined at dawn and at midday, is discussed. The relationship between PMS in Douglas-fir and colonization by meristem insects was established by correlating the infestation status of a tree with its PMS (diurnal minimum) condition. PMS thresholds were found which indicate whether a host tree is in a condition (a) inducive; (b) tolerant, or (c) abortive to initial colonization by P. nebulosus, Scolytus unispinosus Lec., D. pseudotsugae (Scolytidae), and Melanophila drummondi Kirby (Buprestidae). These PMS thresholds appear specific for each insect species. The relation between the cardinal PMS condition in the insect-host relationship and other physiological parameters of the tree, such as photosynthetic activity, cell division, etc., are discussed. Only trees under PMS levels indicative of physiological condition with curtailed integrative processes become inducive to attacks by meristem insects. Ecological, silvical and entomological conclusions based on the obtained results may be important in forest management considerations regarding reduction of damage caused by bark beetles...|$|E

40|$|Annual {{bluegrass}} weevil [Listronotus maculicollis (Kirby) (1) ] larvae, pupae, {{and adults}} were recovered and identified {{in a sample}} received by the C. Wayne Ellett Plant and Pest Diagnostic Clinic (CWEPPDC) at The Ohio State University on 19 June 2007. Damage to the approaches and collars of four golf course putting greens was detected by the superintendent of Stonewater Golf Club, Highland Heights, OH (a suburb of Cleveland) {{during the week of}} 11 June 2007. The superintendent suspected damage from the larvae of the black turfgrass ataenius, Ataenius spretulus (1). Insecticide applications applied to suppress black turfgrass ataenius did not provide adequate levels of control. A sample was sent to the CWEPPDC for analysis where it was determined that the symptoms were not caused by a pathogen. Adult annual bluegrass weevils were observed in the samples.

40|$|Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and its insect vector, Monochamus carolinensis, both develop within rapidly {{degrading}} xylem {{tissue of}} dying or recently cut trees of Pinus spp. The influence of Monochamus development on B. xylophilus dispersal stage formation was investigated. Nearly all nematodes extracted from wood surrounding beetle galleries were third-stage dispersal juveniles (J 3).

The molt from J 3 to J 4 appeared to be related to adult eclosion in M. carolinensis.

40|$|Hylobius abietis is {{the most}} {{important}} pest of reforestation in Northern Europe. Weevils develop in stumps of felled conifers and emerging adults feed on and kill young trees. In trials conducted in each of 3 years, entomopathogenic nematodes were applied around pine stumps containing late instar weevils. Since these immature weevils are sedentary and occur within stumps at varying depths in soil, it is predicted that nematodes with a cruise foraging strategy, such as Heterorhabditis spp., should be most effective. The three commercially available species used in our trials, H. megidis, Steinernema feltiae, and S. carpocapsae, have cruise, intermediate and ambush strategies, respectively. We also included the indigenous species H. downesi and a strain of S. feltiae isolated from an Irish coniferous forest. Heterorhabditis downesi suppressed emergence of adult weevils in 2 of 3 trials; and commercial S. feltiae and H. megidis NLH 85 in 1 trial each. Stump excavation showed that H. downesi parasitized 55 â 63 % of developing weevils; this was matched by H. megidis NLH 85 and S. carpocapsae in 2 and 1 years, respectively. A higher proportion of larvae (46 %) than of pupae (32 %) or <b>callow</b> <b>adults</b> (30 %) were parasitized by nematodes. All nematodes, including S. carpocapsae, parasitized weevils 40 â 49 cm from the bole of the stump and 30 â 39 cm below soil level. We conclude that heterorhabditids, particularly H. downesi, have greatest potential against pine weevils in stumps, but that a reputation as an ambush forager should not exclude a species such as S. carpocapsae from trials against sedentary subterranean insect pests...|$|R
40|$|Hylobius abietis {{develops}} in stumps of recently felled coniferous trees, and adults emerge {{to feed on}} and kill young seedlings. Entomopathogenic nematodes applied to stumps containing late instar larvae and pupae can {{reduce the number of}} adults emerging. We tested the feasibility of reduced application rate and volume during a broader window of application in field trials in 2004 and 2005. Application at the standard rate of 3. 5 million infective juveniles per stump suppressed the number of adults emerging by up to 79 – 85 % relative to controls for Heterorhabditis downesi, 57 – 64 % for Steinernema carpocapsae and 51 – 56 % for S. feltiae. When the application rate was halved, only H. downesi gave a significant reduction in emergence (75 – 79 %). Nematodes applied in April, May or June significantly reduced weevil populations, and application of nematode-killed insects in May was as effective as an aqueous suspension. A fourfold reduction in application volume from 500 to 125 ml per stump did not affect the percentage of weevils parasitized, and stump excavation revealed that even at the reduced volume, both S. carpocapsae (ambusher) and H. downesi (cruiser) parasitized weevils 40 – 49 cm from the bole and 40 – 49 cm below soil level. A higher percentage of larvae (60 %) were infected than either pupae (36 %) or <b>callow</b> <b>adults</b> (18 %). Our trials show promise for expanding the use of entomopathogenic nematodes against pine weevil, as the standard application rate can be halved, and the volume reduced to 25 % of the standard without significant loss of efficacy, and there is a wide window of opportunity for application, even when soil temperatures are as low as 9 °C...|$|R
40|$|Selitrichodes neseri (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) is a {{parasitoid}} of the invasive gall-forming wasp Leptocybe invasa (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), {{which has}} caused serious damage to Eucalyptus plantations {{in many parts of}} the world. S. neseri is a recently discovered parasitoid considered to be a potentially important biological control agent of L. invasa. The aim of this study was to provide the first basic data on the biology of S. neseri, which is essential for its application in biological control. S. neseri was shown to be a biparental ectoparasitoid. Observation from dissected galls indicated that the parasitoid developed on late larvae, pupae and <b>callow</b> <b>adults,</b> although development did occur in a range of gall ages. Observed nominal parasitism in captivity ranged from 9. 7 % to 71. 8 %. Adult S. neseri specimens, fed with honey-water and galled Eucalyptus leaves, survived an average of 26 days at 26 C. The average developmental time from oviposition to emergence was 19. 3 days ± 0. 2 days. There was no pre-oviposition period. A single female produced a maximum of thirty-nine offspring, with a maximum of ten per day. Dissection of the ovaries showed that twelve ovarioles were present. The sex ratio of S. neseri observed in this study was 1 : 3. 43 males:females. Galls of native insects most closely related to L. invasa and to galls of similar morphology to L. invasa-induced galls, were not suitable for S. neseri oviposition. S. neseri showed considerable potential as a biological control agent of L. invasa due to its relatively short developmental time, long adult life span when supplemented with carbohydrates, ability to utilize a range of gall ages and the fact that it has a high level of host specificity.

40|$|Entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} (EPN) of {{the families}} steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae are a promising prospective control agent of the large pine weevil, Hylobius abietis L. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), a major pest in Irish forestry. Applications of EPN to tree stumps in Ireland and the UK {{have been shown to}} significantly reduce adult H. abietis populations emerging from the stumps. To date however, little work had been done on the host-finding abilities of applied EPN in the field and how those EPN will interact with adult H. abietis either already on site or those that emerge from the stumps. The main objectives of this study were to investigate the behavioural interactions between two EPN species and adult H. abietis and to assess one of the methods used to investigate the impact of applied EPN strains on the indigenous EPN population. To investigate if adult H. abietis react to the presence of EPN, one thousand nematodes were applied to the head region of adult weevils and grooming responses were recorded (Chapter 3). Insects that had Steinernema carpocapsae applied on average groomed for significantly longer (44. 16 seconds), than those that had Heterorhabditis downesi applied (11. 33 seconds). In order to gain an insight into the possible cause of these different insect reactions to these two EPN species observations of nematode behaviour on adult H. abietis were carried out (Chapter 3). Infective juveniles (IJs) of S. carpocapsae {{were more likely to be}} observed standing or moving across the body of the insect while H. downesi IJs were more likely to be observed not moving. It is thought that this difference in behaviour has caused the differences observed in H. abietis grooming reactions. Adult H. abietis were tested to see if the presence of EPN in the substrate would alter the amount of time the insects would take to leave the area (Chapter 3). There was no difference found in the time taken to leave S. carpocapsae or H. downesi treated substrates when compared to controls. The impact of EPN presence in the substrate on H. abietis feeding was also investigated (Chapter 3). Steinernema carpocapsae was found to reduce the level of feeding on bark discs after two days when compared to controls in a choice test. This difference was not found with H. downesi or after two days post-application with either nematode species. Adult H. abietis that had been exposed to EPN did not significantly change the amount of feeding on bark discs compared to non-exposed controls (Chapter 3). In all nematode treatments, infected weevils fed more than non-infected weevils in that treatment. Weevils that died during the assay fed more than those that did not die when exposed to a low dose of H. downesi but not in the other EPN treatments. As weevils that died that were not exposed to EPN also fed more it is thought that this is not due to nematode exposure. Weevils were able to mount an immune response to both S. carpocapsae and H. downesi as encapsulated IJs of each species were found upon dissection of the exposed insects. Foraging strategies of entomopathogenic nematodes have been the subject of several studies but most have been based on simple substrates such as agar and have not reflected the ability of certain EPN species to infect hosts in cryptic field habitats. The presence of twigs in the substrate increased H. abietis larval mortality by S. carpocapsae. Insects that were able to feed differed in their mortality from those that could not in a sand/peat mixed substrate but this difference was not found in a sand only substrate (Chapter 4). The presence of twigs or insect feeding did not alter the mortality of H. abietis larvae to H. downesi in a sand substrate. The various life stages of H. abietis were tested for susceptibility to EPN infection (Chapter 4). The adult proved to be relatively insusceptible to EPN infection at low doses, with a two day exposure of 200 IJs killing none of the adult weevils exposed. Continuous exposure on filter paper at doses up to 4000 IJs resulted in a higher mortality rate. In a peat medium with an eight hour exposure mortality was different for each EPN species tested with S. carpocapsae killing more adult insects than both S. feltiae and H. downesi at all doses. When larvae and pupae were tested for EPN susceptibility it was found that larvae were highly susceptible to even low concentrations for both continuous and limited exposure. Pupae were found to be less susceptible than <b>callow</b> <b>adults</b> as insects that fully pupated during assays became readily infected by EPN (Chapter 4). The amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method for assessing levels of hybridisation between EPN strains was assessed to examine the level of accuracy possible with this method (Chapter 5). A certain level of inheritance patterns of strains of known parentage was possible but this level proved too low for statistically valid examination. The AFLP method proved to be difficult to reproduce when assessing EPN gene flow...|$|R
