25|$|In {{industrial}} cities local {{experts and}} reformers, especially after 1890, {{took the lead}} in identifying environmental degradation and pollution, and initiating grass-roots movements to demand and achieve reforms. Typically the highest priority went to water and air pollution. The <b>Coal</b> <b>Smoke</b> Abatement Society was formed in Britain in 1898 {{making it one of the}} oldest environmental NGOs. It was founded by artist Sir William Blake Richmond, frustrated with the pall cast by <b>coal</b> <b>smoke.</b> Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the Public Health Act 1875 required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke. It also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts of black smoke. The provisions of this law were extended in 1926 with the Smoke Abatement Act to include other emissions, such as soot, ash and gritty particles and to empower local authorities to impose their own regulations.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{power was}} {{supplied}} through a unique {{system in which}} a pickup shoe rode in a channel above and {{to one side of}} the track. This proved vulnerable to contamination from <b>coal</b> <b>smoke,</b> and after a short time it was replaced by a conventional third rail system. When the Howard Street track was made into a gantlet to allow higher clearances, the pickup contacts on one side were mounted on swinging arms to accommodate the varying distance to the third rail. The electrification was finally discontinued in 1952 when dieselization made it unnecessary.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1890s, the St. Louis Board of Health {{had passed}} anti-smoke regulations, but little {{reduction}} {{was made in}} the problem of <b>coal</b> <b>smoke</b> pollution. In 1906, the St. Louis Public Library was forced to repair its collection due to smoke damage, by 1910 smoke pollution had killed trees in Forest Park, and during the 1920s, evergreens no longer grew near the city and the Missouri Botanical Garden was considering a move away from the city. Studies revealed that in 1926, St. Louis had an annual soot deposit of 870 tons per square mile, far above Chicago and Pittsburgh. Despite efforts at reducing pollution by washing coal prior to burning it, St. Louis smog continued unabated. Among the worst episodes was the 1939 St. Louis smog, which blackened the sky during the day of November 28 and lasted for three weeks.|$|E

Processing methods like poaching and smoking interfere with nutrients and are potential sources of reactive di-carbonyl compounds (RDCs) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This study determined the variations in the levels of total protein, urea and ureate in weaned male albino rats fed on processed fillet; skin, head and bones (SHB), using standard methods. Chemical analyses were carried out on processed fillet & SHB diets under standard conditions. 40 male rats (40. 76 ± 2. 42 g) were fed with processed fillet or SHB diets for 14 days to assay for on total protein, urea and ureate.

25|$|The first steam {{boats were}} made of wood, but steel hulls were soon {{introduced}} and were divided into watertight compartments. They were well designed for the crew with a large building that contained the wheelhouse and the deckhouse. The boats built in the 20th century only had a mizzen sail, which was used to help steady the boat when its nets were out. The main function of the mast was now as a crane for lifting the catch ashore. It also had a steam capstan on the foredeck near the mast for hauling nets. The boats had narrow, high funnels so that the steam and thick <b>coal</b> <b>smoke</b> was released high above the deck {{and away from the}} fishermen. These funnels were nicknamed woodbines because they looked like the popular brand of cigarette. These boats had a crew of twelve made up of a skipper, driver, fireman (to look after the boiler) and nine deck hands.|$|E

60|$|It was in {{a spacious}} and low room, with an outlook on the court, that I found them bestowed. In the good days of that house the {{apartment}} had probably served as a library, for there were traces of shelves along the wainscot. Four or five mattresses {{lay on the floor}} in a corner, with a frowsy heap of bedding; near by was a basin and a cube of soap; a rude kitchen-table and some deal chairs stood together at the far end; and the room was illuminated by no less than four windows, and warmed by a little, crazy, sidelong grate, propped up with bricks in the vent of a hospitable chimney, in which a pile of <b>coals</b> <b>smoked</b> prodigiously and gave out a few starveling flames. An old, frail, white-haired officer sat in one of the chairs, which he had drawn close to this apology for a fire. He was wrapped in a camlet cloak, of which the collar was turned up, his knees touched the bars, his hands were spread in the very smoke, and yet he shivered for cold. The second—a big, florid, fine animal of a man, whose every gesture labelled him the cock of the walk and the admiration of the ladies—had apparently despaired of the fire, and now strode up and down, sneezing hard, bitterly blowing his nose, and proffering a continual stream of bluster, complaint, and barrack-room oaths.|$|R
2500|$|Among the downsides {{to rapid}} {{industrialization}} was pollution, of which St. Louis generated a great deal. Brick firing produced {{particulate air pollution}} and paint making created lead dust, while beer and liquor brewing produced grain swill. However, the worst pollution was coal dust and smoke, for which St. Louis was infamous by the 1890s. Nearly every factory relied on coal to fire steam boilers, the region's homes used a relatively more polluting form of bituminous coal, and railroad traffic created large, dense clouds of <b>coal</b> <b>smoke</b> around depots and railyards. [...] Noise pollution also was a problem, as many residential areas were intermixed with industrial areas. In spite of efforts to fill sinkholes before the Civil War, quarries dug holes in lots to produce brick, stone and soil for the building trades. These holes often filled with industrial waste, sewage, garbage, and dirty runoff.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first use}} of {{electrification}} on a main line was on a four-mile stretch of the Baltimore Belt Line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B) in 1895 connecting the main portion of the B to the new line to New York through [...] a series of tunnels {{around the edges of}} Baltimore's downtown. Parallel tracks on the Pennsylvania Railroad had shown that <b>coal</b> <b>smoke</b> from steam locomotives would be a major operating issue and a public nuisance. Three Bo+Bo units were initially used, {{at the south end of}} the electrified section; they coupled onto the locomotive and train and pulled it through the tunnels. Railroad entrances to New York City required similar tunnels and the smoke problems were more acute there. A collision in the Park Avenue tunnel in 1902 led the New York State legislature to outlaw the use of smoke-generating locomotives south of the Harlem River after 1 July 1908. In response, electric locomotives began operation in 1904 on the New York Central Railroad. In the 1930s, the Pennsylvania Railroad, which had introduced electric locomotives because of the NYC regulation, electrified its entire territory east of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.|$|E
