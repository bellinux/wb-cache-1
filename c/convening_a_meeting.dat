25|$|The {{term of the}} {{legislature}} expired on 5 November 1933. However, the elections to the Madras Legislative Council were delayed by a year. Meanwhile, the Indian National Congress had decided {{to participate in the}} elections at a meeting in Patna in May 1934 and hence, when the elections took place in November 1934, the Justice Party lost miserably. However, the Raja of Bobbili adopted contingency measures by immediately <b>convening</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> and conducting negotiations between the different factions of the party. The Swarajya Party which won a majority in the Assembly once again refused to form the government in accordance with its policy of wrecking the dyarchy. So, the Raja of Bobbili was elected Chief Minister for a second term though he did not command the majority of the house.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 June 1953, Beria {{was arrested}} and held in an {{undisclosed}} location near Moscow. Accounts of Beria's fall vary considerably. By the most likely account, Khrushchev prepared an elaborate ambush, <b>convening</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> of the Presidium on 26 June, where he suddenly launched a scathing attack on Beria, accusing him of being a traitor and spy in the pay of British intelligence. Beria was taken completely by surprise. He asked, [...] "What's going on, Nikita Sergeyevich? Why are you picking fleas in my trousers?" [...] Molotov and others quickly spoke against Beria one after the other, followed by a motion by Khrushchev for his instant dismissal.|$|E
2500|$|George Monbiot {{blamed the}} failure of the conference to achieve a binding deal on the United States Senate and Barack Obama. By {{negotiating}} the Copenhagen Accord with only a select group of nations, most of the UN member states were excluded. If poorer nations did not sign the Accord then they would be unable to access funds from richer nations to help them adapt to climate change. He noted how the British and American governments have both blamed China for {{the failure of}} the talks but said that Obama placed China in [...] "an impossible position" [...] – [...] "He demanded concessions while offering nothing." [...] Martin Khor blamed Denmark for <b>convening</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> of only 26 nations in the final two days of the conference. He says that it undermined the UN's multilateral and democratic process of climate negotiations. It was in these meetings that China vetoed long-term emission-reduction goals for global emissions to decrease by 50%, and developed countries emissions to fall by 80% by 2050 compared to 1990. Khor states that this is when other countries began to blame the failures on China. If China had accepted this, by 2050 their emissions per capita would have had to be around one half to one fifth per capita of those of the United States.|$|E

2500|$|International Men's Day {{was inaugurated}} in Botswana in 2011 by {{coordinator}} Geneuvieve Twala. One of the International Men's Day themes promoted {{was to help}} foster youth to unlock their creative identities {{to allow them to}} share their gifts with peers, family and the community, and to be seen and heard for who they are and not how they are perceived. The primary event was a gala dinner titled [...] "One moment for Change" [...] to highlight men's potential and the increasing capabilities of men as innovators of society. The dinner was held to raise funds to cover six months music tuition fees for a group of 20 children from the SOS Children's Village whom IMD ambassadors have adopted as part of a mentoring programme for children. Standard Chartered Bank sponsored the dinner, which included a range of iconic speakers who shared their experience and insights with the audience. Standard Chartered Bank Acting CEO Mr Michael Wiegand opened the event by sharing best practices that Standard Chartered Bank uses to address legitimate issues faced by male employees, including the fact that Standard Chartered Bank is the first company in Botswana to offer paternity leave which, he stated, made their male employees feel valued and that they were working for a 21st-century organization. Mr Tebogo Sebego, senior partner at Sebego & Sharma Attorneys and former chairperson of the Law Society of Botswana gave a keynote speech where he emphasized how the child protection laws should be improved, how the society play a role in creating a safe environment for the future generation of men. Mrs Tjipo Mothobi, Director, GBC Health South Africa gave an address on business collective effort. The District Commissioner in his closing remarks made an announcement that by end of December he was <b>convening</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> with men in the City where they will engage in dialogue on how they can collectively address the issues and challenges men and boys face. The inaugural event was a success, with radio stations subsequently airing programmes that call for debate on men's issues since IMD. All the businesses and stakeholders involved gave a commitment to be {{part and parcel of the}} next IMD and we are already working on the strategy for 2012.|$|E

60|$|Tappitt {{was in this}} {{frame of}} mind, and was seated on his office stool, with his hat over his eyes, when he was {{informed}} {{by one of the}} boys about the place that a deputation from the town had come to wait upon him;--so he pulled off his hat, and begged that the deputation might be shown into the counting-house. The deputation consisted of three tradesmen who were desirous of <b>convening</b> <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> with the view of discussing the petition against Mr. Cornbury's return to Parliament, and they begged that Mr. Tappitt would take the chair. The meeting was to be held at the Dragon, and it was proposed that after the meeting there should be a little dinner. Mr. Tappitt would perhaps consent to take the chair at the dinner also. Mr. Tappitt did consent to both propositions, and when the deputation withdrew, he felt himself to be himself once more. His courage had returned to him, and he would at once rebuke his wife for the impropriety of the words she had addressed to him. He would rebuke his wife, and would then proceed to meet Mr. Sharpit the attorney, at the Dragon, and to take the chair at the meeting. It could not be that a young adventurer such as Rowan could put down an old-established firm, such as his own, or banish from the scene of his labours a man of such standing in the town as himself! It was all the fault of Honyman,--of Honyman who never was firm on any matter. When the meeting should be over he would say a word or two to Sharpit, and see if he could not put the matter into better training.|$|E

50|$|The first {{computers}} were large, expensive and proprietary. The move towards commodity computing began when DEC introduced the PDP-8 in 1965.

The entire minicomputer industry sprang up to supply the demand for 'small' computers like the PDP-8.
