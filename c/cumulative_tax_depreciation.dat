40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{framework for}} the discussion of accelerated <b>tax</b> <b>depreciation</b> methods for regulated utilities is constructed. Using this framework a number of results are derived, some of them novel. We show, for example, under what circumstances interested parties such as the customers and the tax collector should rationally prefer flowthrough or normalization. The most important conclusion is that, following a switch from straight-line book and <b>tax</b> <b>depreciation</b> to accelerated <b>tax</b> <b>depreciation</b> with flowthrough, very substantial rate increases will always be required after a fixed interval, regardless of the firm's growth rate. Effects of accelerated <b>tax</b> <b>depreciation</b> on interest coverage and tax-free dividends are also discussed, and some numerical results are given. The model is general enough to allow incorporation {{of a number of}} realistic conditions, as, for example, debt in the capital structure and a dispersed life table. ...|$|R

The objective is maximization of shareholder value. When <b>tax</b> <b>depreciation</b> differs from technical depreciation, an additional investment not only generates value {{due to the fact}} that the firm can produce more, but also {{due to the fact that}} an additional deferred tax liability arises. Two types of capital stock will therefore affect shareholder value, i. e. the replacement value of the assets and the tax base of the assets. We present a dynamic model of the firm with these two types of capital stock, and study the effects of the <b>tax</b> <b>depreciation</b> rate on the firm's optimal dynamic investment strategy, dividend policy, and long run capital stock level...|$|R

It compares the component method, which has recently {{appeared in the}} Czech legal regulations, with the traditional methods. To compare the effects that the traditional methods have on profit or loss, or rather on the tax base, also the generation of provisions is used. The use of component depreciation is governed solely by the accounting regulations while the Income Tax Act has not been changed in this respect. Profit of loss has to be adjusted by a difference amount between accounting <b>depreciation</b> and <b>tax</b> <b>depreciation</b> in <b>tax</b> return.
