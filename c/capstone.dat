5|$|The Motmot <b>Capstone</b> is an inscribed {{stone that}} was placed over a tomb under Structure 10L-26. Its face was finely sculpted with {{portraits of the}} first two kings of the Copán dynasty, K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and K'inich Popol Hol, facing towards each other with a double column of hieroglyphs between them, all {{contained}} within a quatrefoil frame. The frame and the hieroglyphic names of mythological locations underneath the feet of the two kings place them in a supernatural realm. The <b>capstone</b> bears two calendrical dates, in AD435 and AD441. The second of these is probably the date that the <b>capstone</b> was dedicated.|$|E

5|$|Originally, the {{transept}} chambers {{would have}} been covered with one large (or several smaller) capstones, enclosing the chambers containing human remains.

There is no record of a <b>capstone</b> having been discovered.|$|E
25|$|Wall {{painting}} also {{occurs on}} vault <b>capstones,</b> in tombs (e.g., Río Azul), and in caves (e.g., Naj Tunich), usually executed in black on a whitened surface, at {{times with the}} additional use of red paint. Yucatec vault <b>capstones</b> often show a depiction of the enthroned lightning deity (e.g., Ek' Balam).|$|R

5|$|The {{memorial}} comprises a {{base with}} obelisk and <b>capstone,</b> {{standing on a}} raised mound. The list of 125 names engraved on the monument includes four captains, seven lieutenants (one {{of which was a}} chaplain), three sergeants, and 119 privates. The memorial underwent a restoration in 1984, and is decorated annually with a handmade evergreen garland and wreath on Hampshire County Confederate Memorial Day.|$|E
5|$|Under the <b>Capstone</b> {{refurbishment}} program most Amfleet I short-distance coaches {{had three}} rows of seats removed, reducing their total capacity from 84 to 72 seats. During the 1980s {{most of the}} Amfleet I long-distance coaches were refurbished for use on the premium Metroliner service on the Northeast Corridor. All have since been rebuilt, either as 62-seat business class cars or 72-seat short-distance cars.|$|E
5|$|Desert {{conditions}} returned briefly, {{creating the}} White Throne member, but encroaching seas again beveled the coastline, forming a regional unconformity. Thin beds of clay and silt {{mark the end}} of this formation. The most prominent outcrops of this formation make up the <b>capstone</b> of West Temple in Zion Canyon. Rain dissolves some of the iron oxide and thus streaks Zion's cliffs red (the red streak seen on the Altar of Sacrifice is a famous example). Temple Cap iron oxide is also the source of the red-orange color of much {{the lower half of the}} Navajo Formation.|$|E
50|$|The {{sides of}} grave E, like grave A, {{comprise}} four supporters each, on which lie three <b>capstones.</b> The support stone on the southwestern end was restored. From {{the fact that}} two of the chambers <b>capstones</b> (the southwestern and the centre one) have been found in halves, {{it is not difficult to}} surmise that the stone blocks were artificially split in prehistoric times. In carrying out the restoration work the two easily movable <b>capstones</b> were replaced. The chamber has internal measurements of 5.6 x 2 m. Only the two external pillars are left from the entrance in the middle of the southeastern side.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Graduate School of Business and Public Policy (GSBPP) {{is committed to}} a process of continuous improvement throughout all business practices, to include its present approach to facilitating student <b>capstones</b> (i. e., projects and theses). The first step in any process improvement effort is to accurately define the existing, as-is state of the process to be improved. The project team seeks to describe the existing GSBPP approach to facilitating student <b>capstones</b> through careful {{data collection and analysis}} from multiple sources, including the GSBPP exit survey, archived GSBPP <b>capstones,</b> faculty advisement data, faculty interviews, and a new GSBPP student survey in order to detail the <b>capstone's</b> process, content, and value to multiple stakeholders. The project team also employs the Plan- Do-Study-Act framework for continuous process improvement throughout. It is not within the scope of this report to understand, control, or improve the current GSBPP approach to facilitating student <b>capstones.</b> Rather, this report only collects and presents data about the current approach so that GSBPP can understand it, control it, and improve it insofar as GSBPP finds it advantageous to do so.

5|$|Stela 63 was {{dedicated}} by K'inich Popol Hol. Its sculpture consists purely of finely carved hieroglyphic texts {{and it is}} possible that it was originally commissioned by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' with additional texts added to the sides of the monument by his son. The text contains the same date in AD435 that appears on the Motmot <b>Capstone.</b> Stela63 was deliberately broken, together with its hieroglyphic step, during the ritual demolishing of the Papagayo phase of Temple 26. The remains of the monuments were then interred in the building before the next phase was built.|$|E

5|$|Victory in the Franco-Prussian War {{proved the}} <b>capstone</b> of the {{nationalist}} issue. In {{the first half}} of the 1860s, Austria and Prussia both contended to speak for the German states; both maintained they could support German interests abroad and protect German interests at home. In responding to the Schleswig-Holstein Question, they both proved equally diligent in doing so. After the victory over Austria in 1866, Prussia began internally asserting its authority to speak for the German states and defend German interests, while Austria began directing more and more of its attention to possessions in the Balkans. The victory over France in 1871 expanded Prussian hegemony in the German states to the international level. With the proclamation of Wilhelm as Kaiser, Prussia assumed the leadership of the new empire. The southern states became officially incorporated into a unified Germany at the Treaty of Versailles of 1871 (signed 26 February 1871; later ratified in the Treaty of Frankfurt of 10 May 1871), which formally ended the war. Although Bismarck had led the transformation of Germany from a loose confederation into a federal nation state, he had not done it alone. Unification was achieved by building on a tradition of legal collaboration under the Holy Roman Empire and economic collaboration through the Zollverein. The difficulties of the Vormärz, the impact of the 1848 liberals, the importance of von Roon's military reorganization, and von Moltke's strategic brilliance all played a part in political unification.|$|E

50|$|The final {{layer on}} the top of the wall also {{consists}} of large stones, called <b>capstones,</b> coping stones or copes. As with the tie stones, the <b>capstones</b> span the entire width of the wall and prevent it breaking apart. In some areas, such as South Wales, there is a tradition of placing the coping stones on a final layer of flat stones slightly wider than the top of the wall proper (coverbands).|$|R

Great dolmens have up to five <b>capstones</b> lying on eight to twelve supporting stones.

50|$|Excavations {{revealed}} that the burial chamber originally comprised 20 to 24 upright stones and about 8 <b>capstones.</b> It had a side entrance; this type of grave {{is known as a}} passage grave.

This site may have served as a burial ground for several generations. The dead were laid {{on the floor of the}} burial chamber and prepared for the afterlife by being buried with their traditional jewellery (Trachtenschmuck), earthenware jars and everyday implements.|$|R
