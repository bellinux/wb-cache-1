40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{awareness}} {{that we have been}} overproducing rigorously disciplined, game-playing specialists who, through hard work and suppressed imagination, earn their academic union cards, only to have their specialized field become obsolete or by-passed by evolutionary events of altered techniques and exploratory strategies. We need the philosopher-scientist-artist- the <b>comprehensivist,</b> not merely more deluxe-quality-technician-mechanics. R. Buckminster Fuller The Comprehensive Design Engineering (CDE) program is the next step in Stanford's Product Design Program. This forward-looking curriculum brings together business, human issues, and technology in a comprehensive manner to support the creation of tomorrow's innovations. This integrated academic program consists of Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD degrees in the Comprehensive Design Program. Bringing the students through models and experiments of the what, how, and why innovations occur in emerging technologies, the program prepares students at all degree levels to bring value to the organizations they belong to. Comprehensive Design Engineering Graduates bring products and services across the Innovation Gap and into the market. This paper describes the frameworks used in CDE to enable consistent innovation. 1. Innovation Context Geoffrey Moore’s Chasm Model has become the dominant framework to discuss the development of the markets for high technology products and services. This model assumes that a product exists {{at the beginning of the}} life cycle. The work of the designer begins well before Moore’s model. The engineer is part of a team that transitions technology from the R&D centers into product architectures. There is a similar life cycle for this transition of technology into an innovative product. There is also an analogous gap to the Chasm referred to here as the Innovation Fence. The Innovation is the hurdle technology must jump before it is ready to be integrated into a product or service. Figure 1 below illustrates both cycles and the critical transition points for an innovation to make it into the greater market...|$|E
