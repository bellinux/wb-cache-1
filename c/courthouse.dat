40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Of the 66 old federal <b>courthouses</b> that GAO reviewed, the General Services Administration (GSA) retained 40, disposed of 25, {{and is in the}} process of disposing of another. Of the retained old <b>courthouses,</b> the judiciary occupies 30 of them, 25 as the main tenant, most commonly with the district and bankruptcy courts. When determining whether to retain and reuse or to dispose of old <b>courthouses,</b> GSA considers, among other things, a building's condition, the local real estate market, and the existing and projected base of federal tenants. GSA officials said that after the judiciary moves to new <b>courthouses,</b> old <b>courthouses</b> often require renovations to be reused. Moreover, GSA officials said that it can be challenging to find new tenants for old <b>courthouses</b> due to the buildings' condition and needed renovations, among other reasons. Among the retained old <b>courthouses</b> GAO reviewed, excluding one building that was under major renovation, about 14 percent of the total space (nearly 1 -million square feet) in them was vacant as of May 2013 [...] significantly higher than the 4. 8 percent overall vacant space in federally-owned buildings in 2012. ...|$|R
5|$|Today's DeKalb County <b>Courthouse</b> is {{the third}} {{in a line of}} {{structures}} to carry that name. In 1839 a log structure was built and called the county courthouse; the log building stood {{across the street from the}} current <b>courthouse.</b> Ten years later, in 1850, the second DeKalb County <b>Courthouse</b> was erected. From December 13, 1902 until April 17, 1924, DeKalb-Sycamore Electric Traction Company operated a trolley route between the two cities (DeKalb and Sycamore), which ended at the DeKalb County <b>Courthouse.</b> The current <b>courthouse,</b> which sits on the same site as the 1850 building, was erected in 1905.|$|E

5|$|The first county <b>courthouse</b> {{was a small}} log building. When Corydon {{became the}} {{territory}} capital in 1813, county and territorial officials shared the building. By 1816 a stone building had been constructed, and it served as both Harrison County <b>Courthouse</b> and the state capital building until the capital was moved. As more space was needed, other buildings were constructed to supplement the <b>courthouse.</b> In the 1920s, the latest of these office buildings was razed {{to make way for}} a new courthouse; the old building was acquired by the State of Indiana and preserved as the first state capitol building. The new <b>courthouse</b> was built from 1927 to 1928 at a cost of about $250,000. The building was designed by Fowler and Karges of Evansville and was constructed by J.

5|$|The {{third and}} current DeKalb County <b>Courthouse</b> was {{constructed}} in 1905 at an approximate cost of $137,000. The project reignited {{the debate over the}} county courthouse's location and, once again, the debate over which town would hold the coveted title of county seat. The county Board of Supervisors authorized the project in 1901 and appropriated $100,000 for the new building. The idea for a new <b>courthouse</b> originated as early as 1900, when the essential design elements of the Lee County <b>courthouse</b> were chosen as the model for the new DeKalb County <b>Courthouse.</b> Though the <b>courthouse</b> was modeled after the Lee County structure it does differ; the Lee County building, in Dixon, Illinois, has a rooftop dome and also is longer and wider than the DeKalb County building. By 1903, the appropriation had been upped to $140,000 and the battle over the county seat had begun.|$|E
