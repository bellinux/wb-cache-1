25|$|A coal breaker is a coal {{processing}} plant which breaks coal into various useful sizes. Coal breakers also remove impurities from the coal (typically slate) and deposit {{them into a}} culm dump. The coal breaker is a forerunner of the modern <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E
25|$|The most {{economical}} {{method of}} coal extraction from coal seams {{depends on the}} depth {{and quality of the}} seams, and the geology and environmental factors. Coal mining processes are differentiated by whether they operate on the surface or underground. Many coals extracted from both surface and underground mines require washing in a <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>plant.</b> Technical and economic feasibility are evaluated based on the following: regional geological conditions; overburden characteristics; coal seam continuity, thickness, structure, quality, and depth; strength of materials above and below the seam for roof and floor conditions; topography (especially altitude and slope); climate; land ownership as it affects the availability of land for mining and access; surface drainage patterns; ground water conditions; availability of labor and materials; coal purchaser requirements in terms of tonnage, quality, and destination; and capital investment requirements.|$|E

2500|$|Crude MCHM is a {{chemical}} foaming agent utilized in {{the processing of}} <b>coal</b> at <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>plants</b> to remove impurities that contribute to pollution during combustion. The chemical washes coal in {{a process known as}} [...] "froth flotation," [...] which involves the separation of sand-size particles of coal from the surrounding rock within a tank of water or other solution. MCHM is utilized in about 20 to 25 percent of <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>plants</b> in West Virginia.|$|R

25|$|When coal seams {{are near}} the surface, it may be {{economical}} to extract the coal using open cut (also referred to as open cast, open pit, mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods. Open cast coal mining recovers {{a greater proportion of}} the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the strata may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: Draglines which operate by removing the overburden, power shovels, large trucks in which transport overburden and coal, bucket wheel excavators, and conveyors. In this mining method, explosives are first used in order to break through the surface or overburden, of the mining area. The overburden is then removed by draglines or by shovel and truck. Once the coal seam is exposed, it is drilled, fractured and thoroughly mined in strips. The coal is then loaded onto large trucks or conveyors for transport to either the <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>plant</b> or directly to where it will be used.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} property, Hokutan also bought the rights for prison labor, so the miners mostly {{consisted}} of prisoners. It continued until 1894, when the Meiji government {{under the pressure}} of the public opinion led by Protestant prison director Ōinoue Terusaki (1848-1912), decided on the abolition of prison labour. The prisoners were substituted by other forms of recruitment as that of subcontractors (飯場制度, hanbaseidō) and direct recruitment as well as a thorough mechanization. In 1938, the Tokiwakō (常磐坑), two inclined shafts were mined. Along these the coal was transported towards the <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>plant.</b> In 1952, these shafts were equipped with conveyor belts. When in 1967, the Horonai mine merged with the Shin-Horonai mine (新幌内炭鉱, shin Horonai tankō), these belts transported coal from a depth of 520 meters, over a distance of 2.720 meters towards the plant. The merged Hokutan Horonai mine was equipped with two modern deep shafts and used drum cutters since 1968, which made {{it one of the most}} modern mines of Japan.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} {{cultural}} investments {{were carried out}} in 1958: the newspaper Det nye Kingsbay was published, a public library was established and the school {{moved to a new}} building. By 1959 Ester I was depleted and the railway was closed—transport having been taken over by trucks. That year only 8,000 tonnes were exported. A new shaft was opened the following year, allowing mining to start in Vestre Senterfelt. Production in 1960 hit a record 79,000 tonnes of raw coal, which after being processed through the new <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>plant</b> resulted in 51,000 tonnes. Start of a coke plant in Mo i Rana helped stimulate the domestic coal demand. Washed coal production hit 54,000 tonnes in 1961. By then NOK21 million had been invested in the past years, although the coal prices had continued to fall, and especially in Norway the demand had diminished. Norway was retiring its last steam locomotives, but unlike in most of Europe it was not replicating the coal demand through construction of coal-fueled thermal power plants. By 1962 Ny-Ålesund had 25 family apartments and barracks for 210 male employees. Production hit 75,000 tonnes of washed coal in 1962.|$|E

40|$|<b>Coal</b> mines <b>preparation</b> <b>plants,</b> playing {{key role}} in the coal {{production}} process, have been significantly neglected in terms of modern equipment provision. Ad hoc and short-term spending on modernization and new investments have been usually forced by extremely bad technical conditions of the facilities and the impossibility to achieve proper quality parameters of coal. The results of too few technical investments in mechanical <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>plants</b> were visible as early as in the initial phase of the mining sector reorganization, after significant reductions of the personnel. Too few employees with respect to the necessary level of human resources in <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>plants</b> caused a situation when a usual seasonal increase in coal mining was a great hazard for smooth functioning of the whole mining plant. The main conclusion drawn from the survey and analyses of the technical state of <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>plants</b> of that time was the necessity to immediately begin the process of modernization and development of processing machines, equipment and complex control systems of <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> technological lines. It was necessary especially due to the restrictive requirement to lower the coal production costs as well as the increasing demands of coal consumers with respect to meeting the required quality parameters of a product. The prepared program of research and development works assumed a dynamic development of modern control and measuring devices to monitor quality and quantity production parameters and to be applied in automatic regulation devices and control systems of <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> technological processes...|$|R

50|$|However, {{changing}} {{demand for}} coal in the post-World War II era {{led to the}} abandonment and consolidation of many coal breaking plants. Tipples, coal washing plants, and coal breakers were often merged into a single large plant to achieve economies of scale. Automation led to very significant reductions {{in the number of}} personnel needed to run plants, with smaller modular facilities sometimes requiring only a single operator. These <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> <b>plants</b> often accepted <b>coal</b> from several mines, and many were built far away from operating mines.
