40|$|The <b>coupon</b> <b>collection</b> {{problem is}} one of the most studied {{problems}} in statistics. It is the problem of collecting r (r 3 ̆c∞) distinct coupons one by one from k different kinds (k 3 ̆c∞) of coupons. We note that this is equivalent to the classical occupancy problem which involves the random allocation of r distinct balls into k distinct cells. Although the problem was first introduced centuries ago, it is still actively investigated today. Perhaps its greatest feature is its versatility, numerous approaches, and countless variations. For this reason, we are particularly interested in creating a classification system for the many generalizations of the <b>coupon</b> <b>collection</b> problem. In this thesis, we will introduce models that will be able to categorize these generalizations. In addition, we calculate the waiting time for the models under consideration. Our approach is to use the Dirichlet Type II integral. We compare our calculations to the ones obtained through Monte Carlo simulation. Our results will show that our models and the method used to find the waiting times are ideal for solving problems of this type...|$|E

Several prototype twelve cell coupons were built for NASA using different blanket materials and mounting techniques. The first conforms to the baseline design for APSA which calls for the cells to be mounted on a carbon loaded Kapton blanket to control charging in GEO. When deployed, this design has a flexible blanket supported around the edges. A second coupon was built with the cells mounted on Kapton-H, which was in turn cemented to a solid aluminum substrate. A final coupon was identical to the latter but used germanium coated Kapton to control atomic oxygen attack in LEO. Ground testing of these coupons in a plasma chamber showed considerable differences in plasma current <b>collection.</b> The Kapton-H <b>coupon</b> demonstrated current <b>collection</b> consistent with exposed interconnects and some degree of cell snapover. The other two coupons experienced anomalously large collection currents. This behavior is believed to be a consequence of enhanced plasma sheaths supported by the weakly conducting carbon and germanium used in these coupons.

40|$|HIV {{self-testing}} (HIVST) {{may play}} a role in addressing gaps in HIV testing coverage and as an entry point for HIV prevention services. We conducted a cluster randomized trial of 2 HIVST distribution mechanisms compared to the standard of care among female sex workers (FSWs) in Zambia. Trained peer educators in Kapiri Mposhi, Chirundu, and Livingstone, Zambia, each recruited 6 FSW participants. Peer educator-FSW groups were randomized to 1 of 3 arms: (1) delivery (direct distribution of an oral HIVST from the peer educator), (2) coupon (a <b>coupon</b> for <b>collection</b> of an oral HIVST from a health clinic/pharmacy), or (3) standard-of-care HIV testing. Participants in the 2 HIVST arms received 2 kits: 1 at baseline and 1 at 10 weeks. The primary outcome was any self-reported HIV testing in the past month at the 1 - and 4 -month visits, as HIVST can replace other types of HIV testing. Secondary outcomes included linkage to care, HIVST use in the HIVST arms, and adverse events. Participants completed questionnaires at 1 and 4 months following peer educator interventions. In all, 965 participants were enrolled between September 16 and October 12, 2016 (delivery, N = 316; coupon, N = 329; standard of care, N = 320); 20 % had never tested for HIV. Overall HIV testing at 1 month was 94. 9 % in the delivery arm, 84. 4 % in the coupon arm, and 88. 5 % in the standard-of-care arm (delivery versus standard of care risk ratio [RR] = 1. 07, 95 % CI 0. 99 - 1. 15, P = 0. 10; coupon versus standard of care RR = 0. 95, 95 % CI 0. 86 - 1. 05, P = 0. 29; delivery versus coupon RR = 1. 13, 95 % CI 1. 04 - 1. 22, P = 0. 005). Four-month rates were 84. 1 % for the delivery arm, 79. 8 % for the coupon arm, and 75. 1 % for the standard-of-care arm (delivery versus standard of care RR = 1. 11, 95 % CI 0. 98 - 1. 27, P = 0. 11; coupon versus standard of care RR = 1. 06, 95 % CI 0. 92 - 1. 22, P = 0. 42; delivery versus coupon RR = 1. 05, 95 % CI 0. 94 - 1. 18, P = 0. 40). At 1 month, the majority of HIV tests were self-tests (88. 4 %). HIV self-test use was higher in the delivery arm compared to the coupon arm (RR = 1. 14, 95 % CI 1. 05 - 1. 23, P = 0. 001) at 1 month, but there was no difference at 4 months. Among participants reporting a positive HIV test at 1 (N = 144) and 4 months (N = 235), linkage to care was non-significantly lower in the 2 HIVST arms compared to the standard-of-care arm. There were 4 instances of intimate partner violence related to study participation, 3 of which were related to HIV self-test use. Limitations include the self-reported nature of study outcomes and overall high uptake of HIV testing. In this study among FSWs in Zambia, we found that HIVST was acceptable and accessible. However, HIVST may not substantially increase HIV cascade progression in contexts where overall testing and linkage are already high. ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 02827240...|$|R
40|$|HIV {{self-testing}} allows HIV {{testing at}} any {{place and time}} and without health workers. HIV self-testing may thus be particularly useful for female sex workers (FSWs), who should test frequently but face stigma and financial and time barriers when accessing healthcare facilities. We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled health systems trial among FSWs in Kampala, Uganda, to measure the effect of 2 HIV self-testing delivery models on HIV testing and linkage to care outcomes. FSW peer educator groups (1 peer educator and 8 participants) were randomized to either (1) direct provision of HIV self-tests, (2) provision of <b>coupons</b> for free <b>collection</b> of HIV self-tests in a healthcare facility, or (3) standard of care HIV testing. We randomized 960 participants in 120 peer educator groups from October 18, 2016, to November 16, 2016. Participants' median age was 28 years (IQR 24 - 32). Our prespecified primary outcomes were self-report of any HIV testing at 1 month and at 4 months; our prespecified secondary outcomes were self-report of HIV self-test use, seeking HIV-related medical care and ART initiation. In addition, we analyzed 2 secondary outcomes that were not prespecified: self-report of repeat HIV testing-to understand the intervention effects on frequent testing-and self-reported facility-based testing-to quantify substitution effects. Participants in the direct provision arm {{were significantly more likely}} to have tested for HIV than those in the standard of care arm, both at 1 month (risk ratio [RR] 1. 33, 95 % CI 1. 17 - 1. 51, p < 0. 001) and at 4 months (RR 1. 14, 95 % CI 1. 07 - 1. 22, p < 0. 001). Participants in the direct provision arm were also significantly more likely to have tested for HIV than those in the facility collection arm, both at 1 month (RR 1. 18, 95 % CI 1. 07 - 1. 31, p = 0. 001) and at 4 months (RR 1. 03, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 1. 05, p = 0. 02). At 1 month, fewer participants in the intervention arms had sought medical care for HIV than in the standard of care arm, but these differences were not significant and were reduced in magnitude at 4 months. There were no statistically significant differences in ART initiation across study arms. At 4 months, participants in the direct provision arm {{were significantly more likely to}} have tested twice for HIV than those in the standard of care arm (RR 1. 51, 95 % CI 1. 29 - 1. 77, p < 0. 001) and those in the facility collection arm (RR 1. 22, 95 % CI 1. 08 - 1. 37, p = 0. 001). Participants in the HIV self-testing arms almost completely replaced facility-based testing with self-testing. Two adverse events related to HIV self-testing were reported: interpersonal violence and mental distress. Study limitations included self-reported outcomes and limited generalizability beyond FSWs in similar settings. In this study, HIV self-testing appeared to be safe and increased recent and repeat HIV testing among FSWs. We found that direct provision of HIV self-tests was significantly more effective in increasing HIV testing among FSWs than passively offering HIV self-tests for collection in healthcare facilities. HIV self-testing could play an important role in supporting HIV interventions that require frequent HIV testing, such as HIV treatment as prevention, behavior change for transmission reduction, and pre-exposure prophylaxis.

It is particularly challenging, however, to achieve high performance of on-demand data retrieval in sparse vehicular networks. Data replication based on random linear network coding can solve the <b>coupon</b> <b>collection</b> problem but suffers the problem of unnecessary data replications which waste the precious communication opportunities of sparse vehicular networks. With real traces we reveal the existence of community structures in vehicular networks, which causes excessive linearly correlated blocks. Motivated by the important observation, we propose a community-aware data replication scheme based on random linear network coding. To reduce the excessive correlated coded blocks because of community structures, we make probabilistic control on the data replication phase, taking the community structures into account. It is demonstrated through extensive simulations that the community-aware scheme can effectively save up to 50 % communication opportunities whiling achieving high performance of on-demand data retrieval. © 2013 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Due to {{the high}} {{availability}} of the Internet, many large crossorganization collaboration projects, such as SourceForge, grid systems etc., have emerged. One of the fundamental requirements of these collaboration efforts is a storage system to store and exchange data. This storage system must be highly scalable and can efficiently aggregate the storage resources contributed by the participating organizations to deliver good performance for users. In this paper, we propose a storage system, Collaborative File Repository (CFR), for large scale collaboration projects. CFR uses peer-to-peer techniques to achieve scalability, efficiency, and ease of management. In CFR, storage nodes contributed by the participating organizations are partitioned according to geographical regions. Files stored in CFR are automatically replicated to all regions. Furthermore, popular files are duplicated to other storage nodes of the same region. By doing so, data transfers between users and storage nodes are confined within their regions and transfer efficiency is enhanced. Experiments show that our replication can achieve high efficiency with {{a small number of}} duplicates. Keywords: peer-to-peer, storage system, <b>Coupon</b> <b>Collection</b> Problem, CFR. ...|$|E
40|$|The budget {{contained}} an announcement {{that the central}} government would actively explore the option of using an appropriate form of the ‘food stamps’ or an alternative scheme to improve the efficacy and {{reduce the cost of}} the current system of administration of food subsidies. The announcement provides an opportunity to discuss the issues of subsidy on account of LPG and device a system of subsidisation based on ‘LPG Stamps’ or some other scheme to improve the efficacy of subsidisation and remove the large distortions created by the current system. LPG subsidy has grown historically and has become quite high because of aggressive growth in connections and increase in per connection consumption in addition to rising input costs. Given that there is evidence that LPG subsidy has been ineffective in increasing penetration in rural and poorer households, there is a case for capping and targeting LPG subsidy. Otherwise it can explode over time unless new connection growth is curbed, which is indefensible. The best option to curtail LPG subsidy would be to eliminate it straight away. However, {{there are at least two}} factors which are likely to make it difficult. Firstly, the input costs are high (from a historical point of view). Secondly, the high input prices coupled with lack of preparatory ground work may result in political mobilization against the move. The next best option which sharply focuses on the deserving segment is direct subsidy to below poverty line families. These households may be given up to 8 coupons every year. Each coupon can be used for subsidy for a cylinder. A separation of the identification and issuance of coupon is critical to the success of this scheme. As clarified elsewhere in the study, by coupon we mean any technology which allows the target group to get a well-defined and secured entitlement. It could be paper coupons with security features or smart cards, using IT for identification and entitlements. Direct subsidy to BPL family through coupon would allow them to pay cash equal to retail price less the subsidy per coupon. This amount and a coupon would entitle them to get a cylinder. The coupon surrendered to the dealer would be in turn be surrendered by him to the Oil companies, who would pay equivalent cash to the dealer. In fact, dealer may get an additional compensation for the cost of accounting and administration. The BPL coupon holders may be allowed to trade the coupons as this would convert the LPG subsidy to income subsidy. Even if the transfer or trade is not allowed, it is bound to take place and the net effect of that would be sharing of subsidy between intended beneficiary and some intermediary. Targeting LPG subsidy to BPL consumers may encounter problems in improper identification about which Oil companies need to work closely with district/ local administration so as to proactively eliminate inappropriately classified consumers. Targeting BPL consumers for LPG subsidy also leaves open the possibility of non-BPL consumers taking connections in the name of BPL consumer and that of BPL consumers opting for multiple connections. Both problems are to some extent self limiting (due to conflict and due to connection charges) but warrant closer examination of new connections under BPL category. Coupon based direct subsidies require efficient administrative support associated with coupon distribution, appropriate documentation, <b>coupon</b> accounting, <b>collection</b> and cash reconciliation. Coupons have to be difficult to copy and print to prevent frauds etc. This can be ensured by printing of coupons at a security press, or by suitable IT enabled mechanisms. Irrespective of any method of LPG subsidy reduction, there is a need to examine the taxes built in currently estimated gross subsidy. The net subsidy to the consumers should be the basis of elimination otherwise the target is self-defeating (by being higher) and not justifiable (elimination of gross subsidy means moving from net subsidy to net tax regime). Even if the state governments continue to collect sales tax, the central government which also collects taxes and simultaneously bears subsidy should neutralize the subsidy estimate from central taxes. The state governments need to be persuaded to retain the current amount of sales tax (but at a lower rate) otherwise states get higher revenue and the price target goes up. In case the state governments were to pay truant on this issue, there is a need to explore whether differential issue prices can be used as a deterrent. Another issue which warrants closer examination is the impact of volatility of input costs on retail prices. Had the industry been competitive, this would not have been a major issue. Clearly, some oversight or regulation is required so that prices are changed at appropriate intervals and are still neither excessive nor too low. It would be appropriate to set up a regulator to review periodically review the input costs and allow changes. He may allow prices on the basis of average cost with a lag or may prescribe a band linked to input costs and may monitor the prices to prevent any abuse. The rationalisation of prices and of tax reform in this sector is long overdue. These need to be simultaneously pursued. It is possible for the entire sector to move towards a revenue neutral cenvat based tax regime. That in itself and the direct subsidization of kerosene and LPG through coupons is necessary to remove all the distortions. The ill effects of the distortions that result in misuse, diversion, revenue loss, and added environmental and governance problems can only be feasibility addressed by the movement away from price based subsidies to direct subsidies. Similarly kerosene subsidises if correctly targeted and administered can have large spillovers in the management of subsidies in LPG. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Spontaneous {{interaction}} {{in public places}} has evolved as crucial concern in interaction design, particularly {{in the domain of}} public advertising. Implicit interaction is a mode of spontaneous {{interaction in}} which the user is not attentively or explicitly expressing input to a system, but the system from observing the user, and considering all the available information that describes the user situation, is used to generate input- and behaves accordingly. We have investigated implicit interaction as a potentially effective means to design for spontaneous interaction in the public. An en passant <b>coupon</b> <b>collection</b> system, CCS, has been developed to implement an implicit interaction based pervasive advertisement process. CCS is based on scanning and identifying Wi-Fi hotspots by their BSSID, and has been implemented for internet enabled smart phones. Scenarios demonstrate how the system collects bonus points, rewards, sales coupons, reward coins, etc. by users just walking by points of interest like stores, bus stops, schools or offices. CCS neither not being reliant to a preconfiguration of the Wi-Fi infrastructure, nor its use for wireless data communication, encourages for a parasitic use of existing Wi-Fi networks (already available in public places like shopping malls, airports, train stops, stations or city centers) as a pervasive advertisemen...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Motivated by {{the study}} of {{peer-to-peer}} file swarming systems à la BitTorrent, we introduce a probabilistic model of coupon replication systems. These systems consist of users, aiming to complete a collection of distinct coupons. Users are characterised by their current collection of coupons, and leave the system once they complete their <b>coupon</b> <b>collection.</b> The system evolution is then specified by describing how users of distinct types meet, and which coupons get replicated upon such encounters. For open systems, with exogenous user arrivals, we derive necessary and sufficient stability conditions in a layered scenario, where encounters are between users holding {{the same number of}} coupons. We also consider a system where encounters are between users chosen uniformly at random from the whole population. We show that performance, captured by sojourn time, is asymptotically optimal in both systems as the number of coupon types becomes large. We also consider closed systems with no exogenous user arrivals. In a special scenario where users have only one missing coupon, we evaluate the size of the population ultimately remaining in the system, as the initial number of users, N, goes to infinity. We show that this decreases geometrically with the number of coupons, K. In particular, when the ratio K / log(N) is above a critical threshold, we prove that this number of leftovers is of order log(log(N)). These results suggest that performance of file swarming systems does not depend critically on either altruistic user behavior, or on load balancing strategies such as rarest first. I...|$|E

Recently, the newer commerce model is online to offline (O 2 O) commerce and various kinds of creative service models have been proposed. It becomes a major research topic since retailer and enterprise may not be ready to utilize the new service model and consumer {{may not be used}} to this type of service. This paper applies customer journey analysis of some popular O 2 O service scenarios, defines an O 2 O Commerce Service Model, and proposes an O 2 O Commerce System Framework. According to this framework, this paper implements a “One-Click Shopping Wall” service to conduct an experiment of the best practice of Proximity Commerce Service. In this case, some offline digital signage is formed to attract nearby users to interact and make some online transaction with their mobile device, and then guiding them to finish the act of consumption in bricks-and-mortar. According to this case study, we conduct the effectiveness analysis experiment to find the key factors of consumer behavior. The research also applied one day promotion where users have to purchase and share product on their Facebook Wall with One-Click shopping mall app. The experimental results includes 352 people counts, 27. 5 % App downloads, 6 % product conversion, 31 % <b>coupon</b> <b>collection,</b> and 30 % social network sharing. This research proposes that 1) the distance between kiosk and store and 2) discount availability are highly correlated to the act of transaction. Thus, it provides a good reference for service providers to conduct attractive promotion to maximize O 2 O effectiveness.

The published article is copyrighted by Applied Probability Trust, The University, School Mathematics Statistics {{and can be found}} at: [URL] "coupon collection problem" refers to a class of occupancy problems, in which j identical items are distributed, independently and at random, to n cells, with no restrictions on multiple occupancy. Identifying the cells as coupons, a coupon is "collected" if the cell is occupied by {{one or more of the}} distributed items; thus some coupons may never be collected, whereas others may be collected once or twice or more. We call the number of coupons collected exactly r times coupons of type r. The <b>coupon</b> <b>collection</b> model we consider is general, in which a random number of purchases occurs at each stage of collecting a large number of coupons; the sample sizes at each stage are independent and identically distributed according to a sampling distribution. The joint behavior of the various types is an intricate problem. In fact, there is a variety of joint central limit theorems (and other limit laws) that arise according to the interrelation between the mean, variance, and range of the sampling distribution, and of course the phase (how far we are in the collection processes). According to an appropriate combination of the mean of the sampling distribution and the number of available coupons, the phase is sublinear, linear or superlinear. In the sublinear phase, the normalization that produces a Gaussian limit law for uncollected coupons can be used to obtain a multivariate central limit law for at most two other types - depending on the rates of growth of the mean and variance of the sampling distribution, we may have a joint central limit theorem between types 0 and 1, or between types 0, 1, and 2.
