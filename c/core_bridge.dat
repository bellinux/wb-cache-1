In this paper, a modeling method to assess seismic vulnerability of hollow core {{concrete bridge}} pier is developed. The method is validated with available experimental results. Code recommendations for hollow <b>core</b> <b>bridge</b> piers are evaluated. It is shown that confinement reinforcement requirements in the codes are sometimes highly conservative and sometimes non-conservative. However, the recently developed confinement reinforcement equations for solid bridge pier at Sherbrooke University can be applied for economic and safe design. It is demonstrated that hollow <b>core</b> <b>bridge</b> piers are not as vulnerable as it is believed traditionally. Such piers can attain expected ductility, if designed properly...|$|E

40|$|Adjacent beam bridges, such as box {{beams and}} hollow core bridges {{have been one}} of the most popular forms of precast {{prestressed}} bridges in the past. Recently, an awareness of major durability problems has led owners to make improvements to the old standards or move away from the system completely. These issues usually stem from the breakdown of the shear key which provides continuity between adjacent members. This research focuses on determining the best improvements that will reduce durability issues and increase the bridge’s service life. A review of previous research performed on adjacent beam bridges is performed, focusing on shear key design and post-tensioning requirements. State Departments of Transportation were also surveyed on their past use of this bridge type and the observed performance of their standard details. Conclusions were gathered concerning the changes in shear key design, post-tensioning and overlay requirements to determine what design methods had the most impact on bridge performance.

The heterodimetallic Tb 3 +/Eu 3 + complex displayed energy transfer from Tb 3 + to Eu 3 + that is unprecedentedly efficient.

Computational modelling traces this result to the steric interaction of the Me groups with the axial carbonyls of the Fe 2 (CO) 6 cluster and low torsional strain for GeMe 2 and SnMe 2 moieties owing to the long C−Ge and C−Sn bonds.

Both ARP-Path and Path-Moose protocols {{belong to a}} new category of bridges that we name All-path, because all paths of the network are explored simultaneously with a broadcast frame distributed over all network links to find a path or set a multicast tree. Path-Moose employs the ARP-based low latency routing mechanism of the ARP-Path protocol on a bridge basis instead of a per-single-host basis. This increases scalability by reducing forwarding table entries at <b>core</b> <b>bridges</b> {{by a factor of}} fifteen times for big data center networks and achieves a faster reconfiguration by an approximate factor of ten. Reconfiguration time is significantly shorter than ARP-Path (zero in many cases) because, due to the sharing of network paths by the hosts connected to same edge bridges, when a host needs the path it has already been recovered by another user of the path.
