40|$|Following {{the reform}} of the Cohesion Policy in 2014 - 2020, two key {{objectives}} and 11 thematic objectives were set. These objectives are allocated to the European Structural and Cohesion Funds (ESCF). SCFs {{are part of the}} European Structural and Investment Fund (FSIE) which includes 5 funds, namely: The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the <b>Cohesion</b> <b>Fund</b> (<b>CF),</b> the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), the European Fund for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs (FEPAM).. The reform of access to European funds is regulated by a new regulation, namely the Regulation of the Common Provisions (RCP) no. 1303 / 2013. The new regulation contains two types of regulations, regulations common to the five Funds (FSFE), but also specific rules for each fund. Initially, the two types of regulations seem to create confusion, but art. 66 of the RCP specifies that FSIE is used to provide support in the form of grants, prizes, reimbursable assistance, financial instruments or a combination of these. In the RDC, it is stipulated that operational programs benefiting from contributions from the Cohesion Fund are drawn up at national level, which did not exist during the 2007 - 2013 programming period. Ex ante evaluations are also conditional requirements for the approval of programs in each Member State...|$|E

40|$|Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) {{are major}} drivers {{of social and}} {{economic}} change. They are also one of the key Thematic Objectives (TOs) in the European Structural and Investment Fund (ESIF). The aim of these funds is to strengthen economic, social and territorial cohesion within the European Union. ICTs not only constitute an important sector themselves, but are also an important enabler of other sectors. This is why, analysis of ESIF data on planned ICT investments show EUR 12. 2 billion encoded in the dedicated TO, but when ICT categories in other TOs are included, this amount almost doubles, to EUR 21. 4 billion. Finding out more about the ICT investment plans of EU Member States and regions is not always a straightforward process. The available data for ESIF are structured in TOs and Categories of Intervention (CoIs); however, ICT investment often funds activities beyond the dedicated TOs and CoIs. To obtain a better picture of planned ICT investments, the European Commission Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content & Technology (DG CONNECT) and the JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (JRC-IPTS) have developed an online tool to display planned ICT investment data on a regional basis. This tool will help EC officials, national and regional policymakers working on ICT issues, and beneficiaries of ESIF, to understand what kind of ICT activities are being planned in Europe. The ICT monitoring tool can be searched using a number of predefined filters, or searches of TOs and CoIs can be customised. The tool also contains a database of keywords built up by a semantic search for keywords in Operational Programmes (OPs). This database allows the user to identify OPs that mention a number of ICT activities more frequently than others, and to identify if a specific topic is mentioned in a region at all. The data set included in the tool is based on an in-depth study of individual OPs, as well as on aggregated data sets. When studying the available data, we found that Thematic Objective 2 (TO 2) does not account for all planned ESIF investments in ICT. Using a broader set of CoIs, planned spending on ICT almost doubled, from 3. 8 % to around 6. 6 % of the combined total of European Regional Development Funds (ERDF), the European Social <b>Fund</b> (ESF), <b>Cohesion</b> <b>Funds</b> (<b>CF)</b> and European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). However, it is likely that even this method fails to capture all planned investments, as respondents to our study indicated that substantial investments in ICT will be allocated to other categories, which would increase ESIF investments in ICT to EUR 35. 5 billion. However, this estimate is not currently included in the tool, as the methods of estimating investments are not judged to be adequate. This range of different amounts of investment reflects the dual nature of ICT as an important sector and activity in itself, as well as an enabling technology in other public and private activities. Taking the moderate estimates, the EU Member States that plan by far the largest investments in ICT in absolute terms are Poland, Italy and Spain; the regions with the largest planned investments are Campania (IT), Sicilia (IT), Andalucía (ES), Slaskie (PL) and Puglia (IT). For example, the region of Campania plans to invest more ESIF in ICT than the whole of Germany. The greatest investments will be in broadband and ICT infrastructures (EUR 6. 9 billion), e-Inclusion and digital skills (EUR 3. 9 billion), e-Government (EUR 3. 4 billion), and smart cities and smart grids (EUR 3. 1 billion). To get a more in-depth view of future plans, we carried out a keyword search of ESIF data. Among the most frequently mentioned keywords are ICT innovation, e-Inclusion, broadband and digital content. This is partly because these keywords are broad and all-encompassing, but the findings also reflect the ambition of many regions to invest in ICT-based innovation activities. Quite substantial ICT investments will go to ICT-based innovation and digital content, but this will be listed under CoIs related to support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and research and innovation, rather than the core CoIs for planned ICT investments.

40|$|AbstractRecent {{debt crisis}} in several European {{countries}} has triggered a debate concerning the government debt sustainability and management.

However, to perform proper evaluation and use modern methods it is necessary to have a robust and complex database which allows researchers and policy makers to utilize modern data-demanding methods. Although there are many data sources in the Czech Republic there is no single complex database covering all cohesion expenditure.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the effects of}} the European Union {{regional}} policy on growth and convergence of productivity.

On average, EU funding had a positive, but concave, effect on productivity growth. However, by separately considering the three programming periods and the composition of the funds according to the objectives defined by the EU, we find that: i) only the funds allocated in the third programming period, when they remarkably increased, had a significant impact; and ii) only Objective 1 and <b>Cohesion</b> <b>funds</b> played a significantly positive effect, while funds devoted to Objectives 2, 3, 4 and 5 had a non significant or small effect. These results indicate that funding became effective when it reached a critical level, and that the funds allocated to Objectives different from Objective 1 and <b>Cohesion</b> <b>Funds</b> may hinder the efficient reallocation of resources across sectors i...|$|R

40|$|In view {{to improve}} the {{competitiveness}} and economic growth {{as well as to}} 		diminish the gaps between Romania and the EU developed states, the Structural and 		<b>Cohesion</b> <b>Funds</b> represent an outstanding source of investment. 		The operationalisation of the structural instruments is paramount for a sustainable socio- 		economic development. 		After Romania joined the European Union, during the programming period 2007 - 2013, 		Romania has been allocated approximately 19. 21 billion euro from Structural and 		<b>Cohesion</b> <b>Funds</b> and Romania’s contribution (including private sources) to complement the 		EU investments was forecasted to reach at least 5. 6 billion euro. 		The absorption of Structural and <b>Cohesion</b> <b>Funds</b> has represented one of the major 		priorities of the Government of Romania since the approval of the Operational 		Programmes, Romania being among the first Member States whose 		Operational Programmes were approved by the European Commission.

At the same time, the paper offers a comparative analysis of the regions in Romania with similar regions in Hungary and Bulgaria, with respect to the percentage of accession and absorption of community funds, together with a comparison with the EU average.
