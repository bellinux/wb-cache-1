[...] At Christianity Today, Russ Breimeier found that [...] "eespite the quiet ending and the increased leanings to pop, <b>Carry</b> <b>Away</b> is a strong worship album of dazzling musicianship and powerful vocalists." [...] Cross Rhythms' Greg Inglis said that the duo [...] "are still relative unknowns but this is sure to change with this release." ...|$|R
5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} {{about the origin}} of Bowie seamount: Geological studies indicate that the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain may have formed above a center of upwelling magma called a mantle plume. The seamounts comprising the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain would be formed above the mantle plume and <b>carried</b> <b>away</b> from the mantle plume's magmatic source as the Pacific Plate moves in a northwesterly direction towards the Aleutian Trench, along the southern coastline of Alaska.|$|E

The Coral Finder is strongly inspired by Titian, and depicts Venus Victrix lying nude in a golden boat, surrounded by scantily clad attendants. It was Etty's first use of the combination of nude figures and mythological or literary references {{for which he was}} to become famous.|$|E
