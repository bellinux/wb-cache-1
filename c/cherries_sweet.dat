60|$|This reminiscence {{brought the}} Welsh Inns in general before me; {{with the women}} in their round hats, and the harpers with their white beards (venerable, but humbugs, I am afraid), playing outside the door while I took my dinner. The {{transition}} was natural to the Highland Inns, with the oatmeal bannocks, the honey, the venison steaks, the trout from the loch, the whisky, and perhaps (having the materials so temptingly at hand) the Athol brose. Once was I coming south from the Scottish Highlands in hot haste, hoping to change quickly at the station {{at the bottom of}} a certain wild historical glen, when these eyes did with mortification see the landlord come out with a telescope and sweep the whole prospect for the horses; which horses were away picking up their own living, and did not heave in sight under four hours. Having thought of the loch-trout, I was taken by quick association to the Anglers' Inns of England (I have assisted at innumerable feats of angling by lying in the bottom of the boat, whole summer days, doing nothing with the greatest perseverance; which I have generally found to be as effectual towards the taking of fish as the finest tackle and the utmost science), and to the pleasant white, clean, flower-pot-decorated bedrooms of those inns, overlooking the river, and the ferry, and the green ait, and the church-spire, and the country bridge; and to the pearless Emma with the bright eyes and the pretty smile, who waited, bless her! with a natural grace that would have converted Blue-Beard. Casting my eyes upon my Holly-Tree fire, I next discerned among the glowing coals the pictures of a score or more of those wonderful English posting-inns which we are all so sorry to have lost, which were so large and so comfortable, and which were such monuments of British submission to rapacity and extortion. He who would see these houses pining away, let him walk from Basingstoke, or even Windsor, to London, by way of Hounslow, and moralise on their perishing remains; the stables crumbling to dust; unsettled labourers and wanderers bivouacking in the outhouses; grass growing in the yards; the rooms, where erst so many hundred beds of down were made up, let off to Irish lodgers at eighteenpence a week; a little ill-looking beer-shop shrinking in the tap of former days, burning coach-house gates for firewood, having one of its two windows bunged up, as if it had received punishment in a fight with the Railroad; a low, bandy-legged, brick-making bulldog standing in the doorway. What could I next see in my fire so naturally as the new railway-house of these times near the dismal country station; with nothing particular on draught but cold air and damp, nothing worth mentioning in the larder but new mortar, and no business doing beyond a conceited affectation of luggage in the hall? Then I came to the Inns of Paris, with the pretty apartment of four pieces up one hundred and seventy-five waxed stairs, the privilege of ringing the bell all day long without influencing anybody's mind or body but your own, and the not-too-much-for-dinner, considering the price. Next to the provincial Inns of France, with the great church-tower rising above the courtyard, the horse-bells jingling merrily up and down the street beyond, and the clocks of all descriptions in all the rooms, which are never right, unless taken at the precise minute when, by getting exactly twelve hours too fast or too slow, they unintentionally become so. Away I went, next, to the lesser roadside Inns of Italy; where all the dirty clothes in the house (not in wear) are always lying in your anteroom; where the mosquitoes make a raisin pudding of your face in summer, and the cold bites it blue in winter; where you get what you can, and forget what you can't: where I should again like to be boiling my tea in a pocket-handkerchief dumpling, for want of a teapot. So to the old palace Inns and old monastery Inns, in towns and cities of the same bright country; with their massive quadrangular staircases, whence you may look from among clustering pillars high into the blue vault of heaven; with their stately banqueting-rooms, and vast refectories; with their labyrinths of ghostly bedchambers, and their glimpses into gorgeous streets that have no appearance of reality or possibility. So to the close little Inns of the Malaria districts, with their pale attendants, and their peculiar smell of never letting in the air. So to the immense fantastic Inns of Venice, with the cry of the gondolier below, as he skims the corner; the grip of the watery odours on one particular little bit of the bridge of your nose (which is never released while you stay there); and the great bell of St. Mark's Cathedral tolling midnight. Next I put up for a minute at the restless Inns upon the Rhine, where your going to bed, no matter at what hour, appears to be the tocsin for everybody else's getting up; and where, in the table-d'hote room at the end of the long table (with several Towers of Babel on it at the other end, all made of white plates), one knot of stoutish men, entirely dressed in jewels and dirt, and having nothing else upon them, will remain all night, clinking glasses, and singing about the river that flows, and the grape that grows, and Rhine wine that beguiles, and Rhine woman that smiles and hi drink drink my friend and ho drink drink my brother, and all the rest of it. I departed thence, as a matter of course, to other German Inns, where all the eatables are soddened down to the same flavour, and where the mind is disturbed by the apparition of hot puddings, and boiled <b>cherries,</b> <b>sweet</b> and slab, at awfully unexpected periods of the repast. After a draught of sparkling beer from a foaming glass jug, and a glance of recognition through the windows of the student beer-houses at Heidelberg and elsewhere, I put out to sea for the Inns of America, with their four hundred beds apiece, and their eight or nine hundred ladies and gentlemen at dinner every day. Again I stood in the bar-rooms thereof, taking my evening cobbler, julep, sling, or cocktail. Again I listened to my friend the General,--whom I had known for five minutes, in the course of which period he had made me intimate for life with two Majors, who again had made me intimate for life with three Colonels, who again had made me brother to twenty-two civilians,--again, I say, I listened to my friend the General, leisurely expounding the resources of the establishment, as to gentlemen's morning-room, sir; ladies' morning-room, sir; gentlemen's evening-room, sir; ladies' evening- room, sir; ladies' and gentlemen's evening reuniting-room, sir; music- room, sir; reading-room, sir; over four hundred sleeping-rooms, sir; and the entire planned and finited within twelve calendar months from the first clearing off of the old encumbrances on the plot, at a cost of five hundred thousand dollars, sir. Again I found, as to my individual way of thinking, that the greater, the more gorgeous, and the more dollarous the establishment was, the less desirable it was. Nevertheless, again I drank my cobbler, julep, sling, or cocktail, in all good-will, to my friend the General, and my friends the Majors, Colonels, and civilians all; full well knowing that, whatever little motes my beamy eyes may have descried in theirs, they belong to a kind, generous, large-hearted, and great people.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> (Prunus avium L.) are a nutritious fruit {{which are}} rich in {{polyphenols}} and have high antioxidant potential. Most <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> are consumed fresh and {{a small proportion of}} the total <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> production is value added to make processed food products. <b>Sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> are highly perishable fruit with a short harvest season, therefore extensive preservation and processing methods have been developed for the extension of their shelf-life and distribution of their products. Scope and approach: In this review, the main physicochemical properties of <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries,</b> as well as bioactive components and their determination methods are described. The study emphasises the recent progress of postharvest technology, such as controlled/modified atmosphere storage, edible coatings, irradiation, and biological control agents, to maintain <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> for the fresh market. Valorisations of second-grade <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries,</b> as well as trends for the diversification of cherry products for future studies are also discussed. Key findings and conclusions: <b>Sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> fruit have a short harvest period and marketing window. The major loss in quality after harvest include moisture loss, softening, decay and stem browning. Without compromising their eating quality, the extension in fruit quality and shelf-life for <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> is feasible by means of combination of good handling practice and applications of appropriate postharvest technology. With the drive of health-food sector, the potential of using second class cherries including cherry stems as a source of bioactive compound extraction is high, as cherry fruit is well-known for being rich in health-promoting components...|$|R

40|$|<b>Sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> {{provide a}} major source of income to Michigan fruit growers. Annual {{production}} in Michigan during the period 1963 - 1971 averaged 44 million pounds, or 18 percent of the national total (Smith, et al. 1973). Bird damage to Michigan cherries is a major problem. Although no figures are available on the extent of <b>sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> damage, Stone (1973) estimated that in 1972 bird damage to Michigan tart cherries amounted to 17. 4 percent of the crop. According to growers we interviewed, damage to black <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> is often more severe than to tart cherries. These growers also report some damage to white <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> but, since whites are harvested before they ripen fully, {{they are less likely to}} be damaged than blacks. Because cherries are damaged primarily by species protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, nonlethal means of controlling damage are required. One promising means is a chemical (methiocarb [3, 5 -dimethyl- 4 -(methylthio) phenol methylcarbamate = Mesurol]), which has shown good results when used as a nonlethal bird repellent on several crops (Guarino 1972). In 1971, Guarino, et al. (1974) applied methiocarb to half a row of 17 <b>sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> trees and to half a block of 22 tart cherry trees in Michigan. The trees within each treated area were sprayed to drip with a 75 -percent methiocarb wettable powder formulation combined with 0. 25 -percent Dow Latex 512 R (now Dow Latex 205) sticker. This sticker was added to improve retention of the chemical on the fruit. One pound active methiocarb per 100 gal. of water was sprayed at the rate of 6. 4 gal. per <b>sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> tree (tart cherry trees were sprayed at the rate of 4. 1 gal. per tree). Estimates of damage reduction were 80 percent in <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> and 63 percent in tart cherries...|$|R
25|$|Raw <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> are 82% water, 16% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and {{negligible}} in fat (table). As raw fruit, <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> provide little {{nutrient content}} per 100 g serving (nutrient table). Dietary fiber and vitamin C {{are present in}} moderate content while other vitamins and dietary minerals each supply less than 10% of the Daily Value (DV) per serving, respectively (table).|$|R
40|$|Background: Low-grade chronic {{inflammation}} {{has been}} implicated as {{a risk factor}} in prostate-related pathologies including benign hyperplasia and cancer. <b>Sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> containing the bioactive anthocyanin (ACN), has demonstrated tumor inhibitory action in model systems, specifically inhibition of inflammatory molecules and prostaglandin biosynthesis. Objective: To assess the urinary and plasma concentrations of ACN from the daily consumption of 3 cups of <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> for 4 weeks and test the relationship of ACN levels and cherry consumption to inflammatory biomarkers in an at risk population. Results: Prostaglandin E 2 Metabolite (PGEM) levels were reduced with cherry consumption in men with elevated baseline values. Conclusion: We conclude that 1 c (142 g) of <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> 3 times daily for 4 weeks significantly reduced the COX- 2 metabolite, PGEM, in men with elevated baseline levels. This was the first study to examine the chronic effects of daily <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> on COX- 2 inhibition in an at risk population...|$|R
40|$|Currently {{the market}} demand for Swiss organic <b>sweet</b> <b>cherries</b> is {{far above the}} actual {{production}}. However, organic <b>sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> production is under high pressure to change the cultivation system and cultivars {{in order to meet}} the new requirements of the market for a regular supply of faultless and big-sized fruit. Additionally there is a necessity to for a more economical management. In this study we assessed the agronomic and economic result of a modern organic <b>sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> orchard over the first 4 cropping years. The orchard is equipped with modern cultivars like Kordia, Regina etc. and a plastic cover to prevent rain-due cracking and Monilia disease. Sideward’s an insect net is fitted to exclude cherry fly infestation. The results prove that diseases and pests could be sufficiently controlled. Yields were regular, high and economically valuable with cv. Merchant, Kordia and Regina. We conclude that with well managed modern orchard systems there are appealing options to extend organic <b>sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> production...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> trees (Prunus avium L.) are {{susceptible}} {{to a range of}} diseases, but there have been no studies to date about the viral infection of <b>sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> trees in Spain. To determine the phytosanitary status of Spanish <b>sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> plantations, the incidence and leaf symptoms induced by Prune dwarf (PDV), Prunus necrotic ringspot (PNRSV) and Apple chlorotic leaf spot (ACLSV) viruses were investigated during 2009. Young leaf samples were taken from 350 <b>sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> trees, corresponding to 17 cultivars, and were analysed by double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA). To associate the leaf symptoms with the virus, 50 mature leaves from each infected tree were visually inspected during the summer. The ELISA results revealed that 72 % of <b>sweet</b> <b>cherry</b> trees were infected by {{at least one of the}} viruses. PDV occurred in all sampled cultivars and presented the highest infection rate, followed by ACLSV and PNRSV. A high number of trees showed asymptomatic, in both single and mixed infections. The leaf symptoms associated with the viruses involved generalized chlorosis around the midvein (PDV), chlorotic and dark brown necrotic ringspots on both secondary veins and intervein regions (PNRSV), chlorotic and reddish necrotic ringspots (ACLSV) and generalized interveinal chlorosis (PDV-PNRSV) ...|$|R
