Islam requires {{both men and women}} to dress modestly; this <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> known as hijab and covers a wide interpretation of behavior and garments. There is mixed opinion among feminists over extremes of externally imposed control. Women from other religions are also expected to follow dress codes.|$|E
5|$|Several teams compete {{annually}} for secondary MLS rivalry cups that are typically contested by two teams, usually geographic rivals (e.g., Portland vs. Seattle vs. Vancouver).

5|$|The Opel Monza <b>Concept</b> <b>is</b> a four-seat coupe plug-in hybrid {{concept car}} with {{gullwing}} door unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show. The concept shares {{the same basic}} plug-in hybrid setup as the Chevrolet Volt and Opel Ampera, but using a turbocharged 1 L 3-cylinder natural gas-powered engine as its range extender instead of General Motors’ current 1.4 L gasoline engine. According to Opel, this <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> the role-model {{for the next generation}} of Opel cars, and because of its modular chassis design, future cars based on it would be able to accommodate gasoline, diesel or electric power.|$|E

40|$|What <b>are</b> <b>Concepts?</b> The {{discussion}} of conceptual change in part IV assumed that <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> {{an important part}} of scientific knowledge, but largely ignored the crucial question of what <b>concepts</b> <b>are.</b> Previous chapters mentioned many important science concepts such as life, mind, and disease. I have taken for granted the standard cognitive science assumption that <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> mental representations, but have not provided a theory of what <b>concepts</b> <b>are.</b> This chapter draws on ideas of Chris Eliasmith (forthcoming) to argue that concepts, including scientific ones, are semantic pointers- neural processes with powerful semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic capabilities. Most generally, <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> representations corresponding to individual words that stand for classes of things; for example the concept car corresponding to the word “car ” that stands for the class of cars. The history of philosophy and cognitive science has witnessed many different interpretations of <b>concepts,</b> including: <b>Concepts</b> <b>are</b> abstract entities, for example the forms of Plato. • <b>Concepts</b> <b>are</b> copies of sense impressions, for example the ideas of Hume (1888). <b>Concepts</b> <b>are</b> data structures that depict prototypes, for example the frames o...|$|R

For a specific guiding star used to make landfall on an island, the Polynesian term is hoku ai’aina, which is translated to “stars which ate, ruled the land”.

5|$|A logical {{extension}} of the humanist sans-serif <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> the font superfamily: a serif font and a matching humanist sans-serif with similar letterforms. Martin Majoor's FF Scala Sans is a popular example of this influenced by Gill's work, as are Charlotte Sans and Serif by Michael Gills for Letraset and Mr and Mrs Eaves by Zuzana Licko, {{which are based on}} Baskerville. Indeed, Monotype themselves released Joanna Sans in 2015, as a screen-optimised sans-serif font intended to complement (but not exactly match) Gill's serif design Joanna. It is intended for use at smaller sizes than Gill Sans.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} <b>concept</b> <b>is</b> {{that they}} formed {{closer to the}} Sun, where the matter density was higher, and then subsequently migrated to their current orbits after {{the removal of the}} gaseous protoplanetary disc. This hypothesis of migration after formation is favoured, due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations of small objects observed in the trans-Neptunian region. The current most widely accepted explanation of the details of this hypothesis is known as the Nice model, which explores the effect of a migrating Neptune and the other giant planets on the structure of the Kuiper belt.|$|E

5000|$|Yet {{another way}} of categorizing meta-ethical {{theories}} is to distinguish between centralist and non-centralist theories. The debate between centralism and non-centralism revolves around {{the relationship between the}} so-called [...] "thin" [...] and [...] "thick" [...] concepts of morality. Thin moral <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> those such as good, bad, right, and wrong; thick moral <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> those such as courageous, inequitable, just, or dishonest. [...] While both sides agree that the thin <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> more general and the thick more specific, centralists hold that the thin <b>concepts</b> <b>are</b> antecedent to the thick ones and that the latter are therefore dependent on the former. That is, centralists argue that one must understand words like [...] "right" [...] and [...] "ought" [...] before understanding words like [...] "just" [...] and [...] "unkind."
