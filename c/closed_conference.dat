5000|$|In {{the later}} {{years of the}} Soviet Union {{accurate}} detailed information regarding conditions in Soviet agriculture was considered a state secret when not censored outright. A major breach in security occurred in 1983 when {{the details of a}} classified paper, [...] "for internal use only", the report from the <b>closed</b> <b>conference</b> in Novosibirsk by Tatyana Zaslavskaya regarding the crisis in Soviet agriculture, were published in the Washington Post. It was called «О совершенствовании социалистических производственных отношений и задачах экономической социологии» (“About the perfection of socialist relations of production and problems of economic sociology”) and was next to the United States also published in Germany. In the USSR all copies of the “Novosibirsk manifesto” were withdrawn by the KGB. Later it became known as the Novosibirsk Report in the West and was often considered one of the first signs of perestroika. Although expressed in terms of Marxist theory, this paper—an outline of a proposed research project to study the social mechanisms of economic development as exemplifed in Siberian agriculture—was sharply critical of current conditions. Zaslavskaya was the author of a number of works in Russian which deal with economics and social conditions in Soviet agriculture although some of her work was suppressed by Soviet censors. For example, The Methodology of Comparing Labour Productivity in Agriculture in the USSR and the USA, written together with M.I. Sidorova, was suppressed due to its pessimistic results ...|$|E
5000|$|By 1917, {{with the}} armies stalemated on both fronts, Erzberger changed his {{political}} stance. He {{became one of}} the leading opponents of unrestricted submarine warfare and in April 1917 met a Russian envoy in Stockholm to discuss peace terms. [...] He elucidated his views on the war in a speech in the Reichstag on 6 July in which he called on the government to denounce territorial ambitions and conclude a negotiated end to the war. The speech was remarkable at the time in that he carefully delineated the extent of German military weakness. Two weeks later, on 19 July, he put to the vote what he called a [...] "peace resolution" [...] that embodied all the points he had made in his speech. The resolution passed 212 to 126, and even received the support of Chancellor Michaelis. But the Chancellor had hamstrung the resolution by adding to his support the proviso [...] "as I interpret it," [...] which he then used as an excuse to completely ignore its prescriptive power. That July, at a <b>closed</b> <b>conference</b> in Frankfurt, Erzberger revealed the content of a pessimistic secret report from Austria-Hungary's foreign minister Count Czernin to the Austrian Emperor Karl. This report came into the possession of the Allies. Although it has never been proven that Erzberger was responsible, those on the radical right now saw him as a traitor to his country. The restructuring of the War Office was deemed vital to moderating extreme militarism. One of the successes was the Budget Committee in Reichstag which Erzberger used to successfully navigate the Auxiliary Service Bill into law. On 25, 27, and 28 November he spoke with eloquence and passion on modernising the administration. He won widespread socialist support for trying to protect the civil rights of citizens to the Bundesrat: it was an important victory for civilian law-makers. But General Groener's dismissal had brought a crisis: Erzberger took advantage of Bauer's military conversations on 10 and 19 June to be his own man. On July 6 the devastating attack on unrestricted submarine warfare had radicalized the socialists in the Reichstag precipitating the shift in foreign policy. With Ebert's oratory he galvanised moderate opponents of the 'war party' to pacify the starving workers. The intrigues undermined Bethmann-Hollweg's government, dividing the Chancellor from the Reichstag. The coalition of July 9 was disruptive, yet a principled defence of factory workers rights; he had been expected to be a willing tool of OHL, content to propagandize. Instead the outspoken demagogue had earnt the lasting enmity of the Kaiser's government, but more particularly the militarists, who now ruled Germany. The advance of a manhood suffrage bill precipitated the Chancellor's downfall; but without a socialist revolution would be even more certain. [...] This failure and Ludendorff's refusal to support the War Minister triggered his resignation and another crisis. Still warning about big business pressure for profit-taking masked the real collapse in domestic confidence that Erzberger longed to pin on reactionary industrialists.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the effect on the cost of capital of {{increased}} disclosure that reduces information asymmetry among market participants. Design/methodology/approach – This study uses the decision to regularly hold open (<b>closed)</b> <b>conference</b> calls pre-Reg FD as a proxy for a commitment to the policy of public (selective) disclosure and a cross-sectional research design to examine the associations between open/closed conference calls and three proxies for firms' cost of capital (i. e. bid-ask spreads, share turnover, and implied costs of capital). Findings – The results show that firms that commit to open calls exhibit lower relative bid-ask spreads, lower implied costs of capital, and higher share turnover than firms that commit to closed calls. Practical implications – The findings suggest that increased disclosure that “levels the playing field” for small investors benefits investors as a whole by improving firms' market liquidity and reducing the cost of capital. Originality/value – This study contributes to existing literature on the association between corporate disclosure and firms' cost of capital.

40|$|Objective: Menopause is {{associated}} with physiologic changes that may have negative effects on {{quality of life in}} some women and/or that may increase morbidity and mortality secondary to osteoporosis and/or coronary heart disease. Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) and combined estrogen/progestogen therapy (hormone replacement therapy [HRT]) {{play an important role in}} reducing these negative effects. The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) sought to develop treatment algorithms that could assist the clinician in deciding whether to recommend ERT/HRT to postmenopausal women. Design: NAMS held a <b>closed</b> <b>conference</b> of experts to develop a decision tree that outlined the rational use of ERT/HRT in postmenopausal women on the basis of risks versus benefits. The proceedings of the conference were used to assist the NAMS Board of Trustees in developing this consensus opinion of the Society. Results: On the basis of the conference proceedings, NAMS developed three algorithms for the clinician to use as a tool in deciding whether to recommend ERT/HRT to a woman who is postmenopausal: (1) menopause-related symptoms, (2) cardiovascular risk, and (3) osteoporosis risk. Conclusions: The goal of ERT/HRT is to enhance women’s quality of life as well as to reduce the risks of death and disability associated with osteoporosis and coronary heart disease. The decision to initiate ERT/HRT must be individualized according to each woman’s needs. This decision tree for ERT/HRT presents a rational approach to decision making on the basis of the principles of care; details of specific therapeutic interventions will change as data from clinical trials are presented...|$|E
40|$|The Getty’s In Focus series {{produces}} {{very small}} books that represent {{a much larger}} scholarly effort. A major portion of the text of these derives from a <b>closed</b> <b>conference</b> of invited scholars who undertake to explore the full dimensions of the subject at hand. The Talbot volume, while fitting squarely into this pattern, represented an even more ambitious undertaking, unusual for the series. When the Getty began constructing its massive photography collection, it built its core from the acquisition {{of a number of}} significant private collections. These included, amongst others, the European collections of André Jammes and Bruno Bischofberger and the American ones of Arnold Crane and Daniel Wolf. These figures, especially the Parisian-based Jammes, began building their collections when the field of history of photography was quite young. As such, they were able to identify and acquire material of exceptional rarity and quality, in many cases items that have had no parallel in the marketplace since. Once the Getty’s collection became public, it sought to acquire well selected items that would fill lacuna in their core holdings. Schaaf had been assembling data on Talbot since the 1970 s and was asked by the Getty to catalogue this special material as a foundation for the In Focus book. He was able to relate their holdings to Talbot artifacts found throughout the world (an expanded version of this is the on-line Catalogue Raisonné project currently underway). This greatly expanded the knowledge of these items and provided a substantial foundation for the conference that followed. The Talbot In Focus book was the first one in the series where the Getty accepted that colour reproductions throughout were necessary in order to present a true picture of these visual documents...|$|E
