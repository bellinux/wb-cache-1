40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a predictive Finite Element methodology for the crush behaviour and specific energy absorption of composite material tubes. Numerical studies were undertaken based on experimental data for the following composite materials: <b>Continuous</b> <b>filament</b> random <b>mat</b> (CoFRM) Glass/Polyester 6 -ply laminate Braided Carbon/Vinylester o 2 -ply, 3 -ply, and 4 -ply tubes o 0 /+ 30 °/- 30 °, 0 /+ 45 °/- 45 °, and 0 /+ 60 °/- 60 ° fibre architectures The modelling approach consists of treating intralaminar and interlaminar behaviour of the composite separately. An existing finite element material model is used to model intralaminar behaviour and a validation is undertaken against coupon tests. Interlaminar behaviour is modelled via a new delamination contact interface based on fracture toughness concepts. The development and application of the delamination algorithm in the commercial FE code PAMCRASH is described and a validation against standard fracture toughness tests is included.

40|$|Presented is {{a simple}} test method to {{determine}} the in-plane shear properties of pultruded materials where the mat reinforcement is of random oriented continuous fibres. Existing standard test methods {{have a number of}} weaknesses and a number of them can be overcome by using the 10 degree off-axis tensile test method, proposed in 1976 by Chamis and Sinclair. Straightsided specimens have unidirectional fibre reinforcement oriented at 10 o to the direction of tensile load. Tension generates a biaxial in-plane stress state that, by employing stress and strain transformations, enables the shear modulus to be determined. The mean shear moduli for the web material in four shapes, from 20 coupon tests in batches of five, are found to be consistent and from 4. 2 - 4. 8 GPa. Given that the 10 degree off-axis coupon is easy to be prepared, with Text - 2 / 35 no technical difficulties this non-standard method can be recommended to characterize the in-plane shearing of pultruded materials having <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> (or strand) <b>mat</b> reinforcement. ...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{pressures}} are driving automotive manufacturers towards light weight cost efficient structures. Composite materials {{have been shown}} to display high specific energy absorption levels thus offering opportunities for mass reduction over conventional steel structures. Whilst composites display these specific advantages, the mechanisms by which energy is absorbed are more complex and are preventing widespread acceptance of composite structures. This work aims to further scientific understanding of the crushing process and provide realistic data {{for a wide range of}} processing conditions and commonly used materials. The main objectives of this study were to quantify the effect of industrial manufacturing conditions on the crush performance of composite structures, and to correlate the performance to a number of in-plane laminate properties. The manufacturing parameters considered are constituent material related (mould temperature, post-cure time and resin composition), interlaminar toughness related and process related (amount of binder and voidage). The work presented in the thesis reports the results of axial crushing experiments, in-plane and inter-laminar testing performed on composite parts made from glass reinforced polyester and vinylester resins. The preforms were made from 2 fabrics; a <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> random <b>mat</b> and a 0 / 90 ° non crimp fabric. All parts were produced by resin transfer moulding (RTM) under conditions which were representative of medium volume industrial processing. Constituent material results demonstrate clear advantages associated with the use of vinylester resin and that while relationships between all in-plane properties and the crush performance can be observed, the ultimate compressive stress is the most reliable indicator of this performance. Interlaminar toughness enhancement shows great promise for tailoring of the crush curve and increase in energy absorption of non-crimp fabrics. Results for the processing work are directly applicable to existing manufacturing and demonstrate the potential for real reductions in cycle time and increase in properties.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} study of the {{flexural}} behaviour and resultant failure modes in E-glass/polyester pultruded composites. The digital image correlation (DIC) method is used to estimate the effect of fibre orientation on failure behaviour in thick beams, taking into account the presence of <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> <b>mat</b> layer (CFM) in the stacking sequence. In particular, the tests were carried out for specimens with off-axis angle of 0 °, 7. 5 °, 15 °, 30 °, 45 ° and 90 °. The crack initiation and the failure mechanisms depend on the mutual interaction between the stiffness properties of different areas in the stacking sequence. An influence index (I) was introduced to evaluate the magnitude of these phenomena. For small orientation angle (i. e. less than 7. 5 °), the failure mechanism is not influenced by the central mat layer and the crack starts from the tension region. For angles between 15 ° and 45 °, the influence of the central mat layer is predominant and delamination occurs at the interface between the mat layer and the adjacent one. For 90 ° angles, the CFM layer does not influence the typical fracture mechanism and transverse matrix cracking occurs...|$|E
40|$|Research to {{determine}} the shear modulus of standard pultruded fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) material is reviewed and appraised. It is found that different test methods have given shear moduli data {{in the range from}} 1. 3 to 5. 1 GPa, with varying degrees of scatter. Pultruded material is comprised of alternate layers of two distinct glass reinforcement types. By applying micromechanical modeling, it is shown that the in-plane shear modulus of the continuous unidirectional rovings layer {{is similar to that of}} the <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> (or strand) <b>mat</b> layer, and that these layer moduli, generally, lie in the range 3. 5 to 4. 8 GPa (depending on fiber volume fraction). This finding indicates that the significant difference (> 1. 3 times) between the in-plane (3 GPa or less) and the St. Venant torsion (always > 4 GPa) shear moduli is likely to be due to the experimental test procedures and the physical interpretation of shearing, rather than the layer construction of the material. For structural profiles, it is seen that the shear modulus of 3 GPa in company design manuals is often less than measured. Researchers require correlated elastic constant data if elastic deflections and instability loads for structural members can be accurately predicted using elastic theory. Further work is, therefore, recommended to establish standard test and analytical methods for the determination of shear moduli of pultruded FRP material...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} work {{undertaken to}} investigate the effects of damage on the energy absorption potential of composite tubes. Tubes of various geometries and manufactured from either <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> random <b>mat</b> (CoFRM) or glass braid and polyester resin were subjected to various types of damage before testing. Damage types consisted of drilled holes, to simulate the use of drilling components for the need of assembly, impacts, to simulate damage that may occur through tool drops or items being kicked up during use and PET inserts to simulate delamination. Large glass CoFRM/polyester tubes with an outer diameter of 89. 1 mm and varying wall thicknesses were crushed quasi-statically at a speed of 5 mmlmin. Small CoFRM and braided glass/polyester tubes with an outer diameter of 38. 1 mm and a 2 mm wall thickness were tested quasi statically and dynamically at a speed of 5 m 1 s. Tubes were tested undamaged and containing various sizes of holes, simulated delamination and impacts. Specific energy absorptions (SEA) and failure modes were compared. Threshold values of damage size have been found for each tube and test type, above which unstable failures and subsequent unpredictable reductions in energy absorptions occur. The small CoFRM tubes showed a decrease in SEA as the test rate increased and this was attributed to the rate dependency of the resin, causing greater fragmentation allowing fibres to bend more easily and without fracturing. The braided small tubes showed an increase in SEA as the test rate increased due {{to a change in}} the mode of failure attributed to a higher compressive strength at the increased rate. Relatively small hole sizes and impacts, of 5 mm and 1. 5 J- 3 J, were seen to reduce the energy absorption of the materials tested at quasi-static test speeds. However, an increase in damage tolerance was identified as test rate increased and this was attributed to an increase in compressive strength and fracture toughness, and reduction in crush load, as the speed of test increased.

40|$|As {{emissions}} regulations tighten worldwide, automotive manufacturers {{must look}} for ways to reduce structural vehicle weight. While employing alloys and exotic metals may provide a degree of weight reduction, a more significant reduction can be achieved through the use of composite materials. Importantly, composites have shown an ability to improve vehicle crashworthiness through higher levels of specific energy absorption and almost ideal crush characteristics. These advantages have not been exploited in mass-produced vehicles, due primarily to the high cost of component manufacture and lack of computational methods for simulation of the crash behavior of such materials. While development of rapid, inexpensive production processes can increase the production volume and reduce cost, manufacturers will still be required to prototype components. The provision of accurate computational models for the failure behavior of composite materials will reduce the demand on manufacturers to prototype designs and ultimately result in structures of higher performance. Herein, a phenomenological Finite Element (FE) modeling methodology is presented, the development of which focused on the accurate consideration of the experimentally observed failure mechanisms typical of the splaying mode of failure. LS-DYNA has been employed to validate a multi-shell model of <b>Continuous</b> <b>Filament</b> Random <b>Mat</b> (CFRM) glass/polyester tubes. This modeling approach utilizes a spotweld approach to modeling delamination with deformable beam elements. Typical constraint-type delamination approaches do not allow shear deformation prior to delamination and result in an inaccurate representation of laminate stiffness. Spotweld validation simulations were performed on 3 -point-bend, Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) and End Notch Flexure (ENF) tests with excellent correlation before application in full-tube simulations. Initiation of the splaying mode of failure was accomplished by pre-definition of a debris wedge, the geometry of which was based on micrograph images of the experimental crush zone. Additionally, the methodology was applied to simulations of plug initiator tube crush experiments and the results are presented. In general, the load-displacement correlation of full-tube simulations is poor demonstrating the difficulty with representing the continuous fracture and delamination processes with discrete elements. Future work will be aimed at improving the simulated delamination behavior to enhance the observed failure mechanisms...|$|R

Recently, also civil engineers focused their attention on pultruded composite materials as alternative to traditional ones (e. g., concrete, steel). Furthermore, to improve the transverse strength and stiffness {{with respect to the}} fibres direction, <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> <b>mat</b> (CFM) is often placed within the stacking sequence.

In this paper, the influence of the CFM layers on the mechanical behaviour of glass fibres pultruded composite material is investigated. In particular, the bending behaviour is analyzed by performing a four-point bending test on specimens extracted from an H-shape member. The experimental analysis was carried out via Electronic Speckle-Pattern Interferometry (ESPI) (handled by phase-stepping technique) to obtain a full-field displacement map and to numerically achieve the longitudinal strains. By imposing the equilibrium conditions and assuming the compression and tensile roving Young's moduli as constant, the CFM Young's moduli are determined. Finally, the mean stress acting on the material is obtained showing that CFM layers have to be considered to correctly evaluate the maximum stress and to optimize the design phase...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA multi-scale {{modeling}} {{framework is}} proposed for generating the effective nonlinear thermo-viscoelastic responses of multi-layered and thick-section composites. The modeling framework is demonstrated for multi-layered composite systems {{consisting of two}} alternating fiber-reinforced polymeric layers: unidirectional fiber (roving) and <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> <b>mat</b> (CFM). The viscoelastic behavior of the polymeric matrix is considered as stress-dependent and thermo-rheologically complex. Two simplified 3 D micromechanical models with periodic boundary conditions are formulated for the roving and CFM. In addition, a sublaminate model is developed for the 3 D effective homogenized through-thickness response of the roving and CFM layers. This framework provides an effective time-dependent material response while simultaneously recognizing the corresponding deformation at the microconstituents under overall thermo-mechanical loadings at the macro-level. Stress correction algorithms are developed at each scale to enhance computational efficiency and accuracy. Short-term (30 min) creep tests on off-axis multi-layered specimens are also conducted under combined stresses and temperatures to calibrate in-situ fiber and matrix properties and verify the predictions of the multi-scale framework. A time-shifting method is applied to create long-term material behaviors from the available short-term creep data. Verification of the multi-scale material framework is also done for the overall long-term responses. Finally, long-term structural analyses under thermo-mechanical loadings are conducted by integrating the multi-scale material framework to finite element (FE) structural analyses...|$|E

These layers can have reinforcements in the form of roving, <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> <b>mat</b> (CFM), and/or woven fabrics. Different 3 D micromechanical models for the layers can be used to recognize the basic response of the fiber and matrix materials. The framework is implemented with both shell and 3 D finite elements. The 3 D lamination theory is used to generate a homogenized nonlinear effective response for a through-thickness representative stacking sequence. The proposed modeling framework for pultruded composites is used to predict the stiffness and nonlinear stress-strain response of E-glass/vinylester pultruded materials reinforced with roving and CFM. The roving layer is idealized using a 3 D nonlinear micromechanics model for a unidirectional fiber-reinforced material. A simple nonlinear micromechanics model for the CFM layer is also applied. The proposed model shows very good predictive capabilities of the overall effective properties and the nonlinear response of pultruded composites, based on the in situ material properties, and the volume fractions of the constituents. Experimental data from off-axis tests of pultruded plates under uniaxial compression are used to verify the proposed model.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{pre-existing}} {{damage on the}} mode of failure and energy absorption characteristics of Non-Crimp Fabric (NCF) and biaxially braided tubular sections under axial loading were considered. Loading rate effects were incorporated by testing at quasi-static rates and impact rates up to 7 ms- 1 and the pre-existing damage was simulated through stress concentrations and out-of-plane impact damage. Circular and square geometries were tested, {{and a range of}} NCF and braided fibre architectures were investigated. A number of failure modes were exhibited. NCF tubes were seen to splay at static and impact rates; at impact rates a reduction in Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) was recorded. Braided tubes failed in a combination of buckling and splaying at static rates. Under dynamic conditions all braided samples splayed and where a change in failure mode was seen, SEA was increased. Both NCF and biaxially braided tubes have been shown to offer a much lower SEA than <b>Continuous</b> <b>Filament</b> Random <b>Mat</b> (CoFRM) samples. A threshold size of damage was observed, where, typically, below that threshold the SEA was unaffected by the damage, and above that size the tube would fail globally. The NCF tubes exhibited an improved damage tolerance over CoFRM and braided samples. The braided tubes showed a poor damage tolerance at quasi-static rates although results suggest that the architectures with high axial fibre content will have a higher damage tolerance. It has been shown that modelling damaged areas of tubes as a cut-out is a conservative approach to finding failure levels. Peak stress was seen to be the dominant factor in determining loading at global failure as samples could fail even though the crushing stress is less than the failure stress. Previous work upon Interlaminar Shear Strength (ILSS) and SEA has been investigated and shown to overestimate energy absorption for tubular specimens and found to apply only to samples that fail by progressive crush or fragmentation; for those that do fail in this mode a link between ILSS and SEA has been stated. A technique for determining SEA and for predicting the effect of a SCF on failure mode of composite tubes has been proposed using UCS (Ultimate Compressive Strength) data and SCF (Stress Concentration Factor) data.

The nonlinear axial stress–strain curves of the off-axis tests are compared with the predicted curves from the three proposed models. Good agreement is shown for all off-axis angles when comparing the experimental stress–strain curves with those predicted by the 3 D micromodel.

With application of the pultrusion method, the manufacture of large-scale profiles with various cross-section forms became potentially possible with relatively low costs. Usually two different technological approaches are available to realize the element: in the first one a mat-roving-mat sequence is adopted, in the second one only roving is present. <b>Continuous</b> <b>filament</b> <b>mat</b> (CFM, fibers distributed randomly in all directions) is often used to build up laminate thickness quickly, as well as to enhance transversal strength and stiffness. Besides, the intrinsic particular features of GFRP materials require the application of new techniques of mechanical analysis to define a correct material model. Many papers study the mechanical behavior of GFRP structural elements at a macroscopic scale even in particular environmental conditions. From the other hand full-field contactless techniques (e. g. digital image correlation, thermal stress analysis, speckle interferometry) are effective tools to correctly model complex mechanical behavior and to define the consequent parameters. Among these techniques, Electronic Speckle-Pattern Interferometry (ESPI) has been asserted as very effective due to the technological improvements of the laser sources. One of the significant advantages of ESPI is to produce real-time fringe patterns on objects with optically rough surfaces, with a displacement sensitivity of the order of the light wavelength.

Analytical representation of a nonlinear single integral equation is applied to model the thermo-mechanical viscoelastic responses for each off-axis specimen.

Linear extrapolation of transient creep compliance is used to extend the material responses for longer times. The extended long-term creep strains of the uniaxial E-glass/vinylester specimens are verified with the long-term experimental data of Scott and Zureick (1998).

As {{an alternative to}} fabrics, which generally provide higher in-place properties, CFMs are often employed as low cost, 'lofty' (high uncompressed thickness, and therefore good specific flexural stiffness), easy to process reinforcements for Resin Transfer Moulded (RTM) parts. Within this project, investigation of permeability measurement has involved the development of two (radial and linear) liquid flow permeability techniques to provide a reliable and robust data set for a specific CFM (Unifilo U 813 - 300). Then two novel (radial and linear) airflow techniques were developed for the measurement of CFMs, these providing comparative results with the liquid flow measurements. The benefits of airflow versus liquid flow include cleaner, lower pressured flow using a fluid that may be produced by compressor rather than stored, therefore having significant benefits for both laboratory and industrial measurements of permeability. Material characterisation is necessary to analytically investigate reinforcement materials, as permeability has a non-linear relationship with overall porosity. Permeability is therefore considered {{as a function of}} pore distribution, which encompasses the two scales of intra and inter fibre-bundle flow. Two areas have been investigated, these involving permeability measurement and microstructure characterisation. Comparative permeability measurements of a second CFM (Unifilo U 850 - 300), consisting of a different arrangement of fibre bundle sizes, were undertaken using the 1 D airflow method, and inter-laminar flow was investigated using the radial airflow method. These resulted in a permeability ratio of between 0. 54 and 0. 64 (U 813 /U 850) across a 0. 1 to 0. 3 fibre volume fraction range for the two CFMs, and no significant inter-laminar pore space effect. Microstructural characterisation initiated with image analysis of electron micrographs, providing measurement of fibre diameters and intra-bundle porosity. Kozeny-Carman modelling then showed the permeability of intra-bundle areas to be insignificant resulting in a focus on inter-bundle flow. Although limited by assumptions made for various material parameters, semi-empirical models to provide inter-bundle porosity and fibre bundle geometries were developed. Relation with permeability was then achieved through calculating hydraulic radius and mean hydraulic radius and provision of a range of Kozeny constants (0. 55 to 6. 17) and coefficients to replace the Kozeny constant, which provide upper and lower bounds for the remaining factors of permeability. The overall future industrial benefits for material engineers rely on the addressing of these limitations for quantifying geometries, so as to provide clarity of the relationship between controllable material parameters and permeability.

50|$|Spinning is a {{manufacturing}} process for creating polymer fibers. It is a specialized form of extrusion {{that uses a}} spinneret to form multiple <b>continuous</b> <b>filaments.</b> There are many types of spinning: wet, dry, dry jet-wet, melt, gel, and electrospinning.|$|R
50|$|In 1913, {{after some}} twenty {{thousand}} separate experiments, they produced excellent laboratory samples of <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> yarn, {{something that had}} eluded the cellulose acetate industry to this time. Unfortunately the outbreak of World War I postponed commercial development of this process.|$|R
50|$|The <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> {{polyester}} fibers {{are gathered}} {{together in a}} bundle of 7-15 fibers and are twisted on a twister frame to form filler yarns. The plied and twisted yarn is then wound onto a spool called a filler bobbin.|$|R
40|$|<b>Continuous</b> <b>filament</b> {{glass fibre}} {{is used in}} the {{manufacture}} of glass yarn and textile products. It is made from either alkali or alkali-free glass. The main ingredients of alkali glass are sand, lime, dolomite, and soda ash; for alkali-free glass no raw materials containing alkali are used, and boric acid is an additional major constituent. There are two methods of manufacture. (a) The glass is fed straight to the fibre-forming furnaces from a direct melt tank; or (b) it is made into solid glass marbles which are fed to the furnaces. The description which follows is confined to the manufacture of <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> by the latter process using alkali-free marbles. Materials and Manufactur...|$|R
40|$|Engineered {{composite}} materials {{are well known}} for their superior properties. For instance, fiber-reinforced composites have improved strength and stiffness over their unreinforced matrix. Short-fiber composites in particular have multiple advantages compared to those reinforced with long <b>continuous</b> <b>filaments.</b> They {{can be adapted to}} conventional manufacturing techniques, suc...|$|R
50|$|Fibre preforms are how the fibres are {{manufactured}} before being bonded to the matrix. Fibre preforms are often manufactured in sheets, continuous <b>mats,</b> or as <b>continuous</b> <b>filaments</b> for spray applications. The four major ways to manufacture the fibre preform {{is through the}} textile processing techniques of weaving, knitting, braiding and stitching.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{artificial}} fibre and composites industries, a tow is an untwisted [...] of <b>continuous</b> <b>filaments,</b> in particular of viscose rayon, acrylic, or carbon fibres. Tows are designated either by their total tex (mass per unit length), {{or by the}} number of fibers they contain. For example, a 12K tow contains about 12,000 fibres.|$|R
50|$|Eri silk is {{a staple}} fiber, unlike other silks, which are <b>continuous</b> <b>filament.</b> The {{texture of the}} fabric is coarse, fine, and dense. It is very strong, durable, and elastic. Eri silk is darker and heavier than other silks and blends well with wools and cotton. Due to its thermal {{properties}} it is warm in winter and cool in summer.|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} forms of yarn dyeing. Common forms are the package form and the hanks form. Cotton yarns are mostly dyed at package form, and acrylic or wool yarn are dyed at hank form. In the <b>continuous</b> <b>filament</b> industry, {{polyester}} or polyamide yarns are always dyed at package form, while viscose rayon yarns are partly dyed at hank form because of technology.|$|R
