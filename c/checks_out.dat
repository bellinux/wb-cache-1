Veronica brings Keith the CD, but he informs her that Hank has disappeared as well. We see Hank {{showing up on}} Mindy’s boat. While listening to the phone calls, Veronica notices Mindy and Hank talking about a place named “Papa’s cabin”. They investigate the most recent phone calls made by Hank, and find that his alibi was faked—he was helping the witness’s son escape foster care. Keith comes {{up with the idea}} that Papa’s cabin {{has something to do with}} Ernest Hemingway. Keith visits the cabin, a retreat in Central America, before boarding the motorboat. He finds Hank, who says that he was working with her to kill the Dean. He says that he and Mindy had a fight, and Mindy fell overboard. We see Mindy’s body washed up on a beach.|$|E

Claudia runs off, and Sandro follows her onto the hotel terrace where he finds her quietly weeping. Sandro sits down on a bench and says nothing; he too begins to cry. Claudia approaches him, and after hesitating, she places {{her hand on his}} head in a gesture of compassion and comfort while looking out at the snow-covered image of Mount Etna on the horizon.|$|E

500|$|He {{receives}} an unexpected visit from his 11-year-old daughter, Cleo (Elle Fanning). Her stay changes his lifestyle little at first, including his indulging an overnight visitor, a blonde woman. Johnny {{and his daughter}} spend time together in his hotel suite and he brings her with him on his daily routine and on a publicity trip to Milan (where he is awarded with a [...] "Telegatto", in a show with local celebrities playing themselves), and through preparations for her departure to summer camp. As their time together grows, Johnny's fatherly emotions emerge and force him to re-assess his otherwise [...] "successful" [...] life. After Cleo leaves for camp Johnny calls his ex-wife and tearfully breaks down admitting his unhappiness at his empty life. His ex-wife is indifferent to his pain and declines his request to come see him. At the end, Johnny <b>checks</b> <b>out</b> of the hotel promising not to return, and drives his Ferrari into the countryside. He randomly stops and gets out, leaving the keys in the ignition, and walks down the highway smiling.|$|E

5000|$|Passengers {{travelling}} on pre-loaded credit {{must always}} <b>check</b> <b>out</b> {{at the end}} of their journey in order for the deposit, which was deducted upon check-in, to be reimbursed to their OV-chipkaart. While <b>checking</b> <b>out</b> is unavoidable at railway or metro stations closed off with ticket barriers, stations with free-standing validator units as well as trams and buses can be exited without <b>checking</b> <b>out.</b> An estimated 2% of occasional passengers and 0.5% of frequent travellers forget to <b>check</b> <b>out.</b> Even though passengers can reclaim their deposit, many are not aware of their failure to <b>check</b> <b>out.</b> In addition, the reimbursement procedure requires submitting a paper or online form with the transport operator concerned which some passenger consider too cumbersome in relation to the amount lost. An investigation commissioned by passenger associations showed that the check-out problem results in an estimated profit of nearly €23 million a year for public transport operators. About half of this amount would go to NS as the principal rail operator. Transport operators have questioned the validity of the numbers, claiming the total amount is not more than a few million euros and that they are willing to reimburse lost deposits. However, an NS spokesperson responded, [...] "the travellers who have forgotten to <b>check</b> <b>out</b> have to announce themselves".|$|R

Ray’s detached arm begins to rebuild itself with metal. Harry is transfixed by this sight as Ray kills him. The next morning, Doggett <b>checks</b> <b>out</b> the new murder scene and finds an interesting shredded document. Doggett goes to Chamber Technologies and learns about [...] "smart metals"—metals that rebuild their original forms but are still a metallurgist’s pipe dream at the moment.

Meanwhile, Larina sees Ray’s obituary in the paper and is watching the television news story about the murder at the salvage yard. She decides to call Ray’s widow.|$|E
500|$|Toward {{the end of}} the essay, Gibson briefly covers two {{applications}} of the death penalty by the Singaporean justice system; he excerpts a report from The Straits Times about , a Malay man sentenced to death for attempting to smuggle a kilogram of cannabis into the city-state, and follows this with a description of the case of Johannes van Damme, a Dutch engineer found with significant quantities of heroin with the same consequence. He expresses reservations about the justice of capital punishment and describes the Singaporeans as the true bearers of zero tolerance. After hearing the announcement of van Damme's sentencing, Gibson decides to leave, <b>checks</b> <b>out</b> [...] "in record time" [...] from the hotel, and catches a cab to the airport. The trip is conspicuous for the absence of police along the road, but there is an abundance of them at the Changi Airtropolis, where Gibson photographs a discarded piece of crumpled paper, incurring their ire. Flying into Hong Kong he briefly glimpses the soon-to-be-destroyed shantytown Kowloon Walled City {{at the end of one}} of the runways at the chaotic Kai Tak Airport, and muses about the contrast with the staid and sanitized city-state he has left behind. The essay ends with the declaration [...] "I loosened my tie, clearing Singapore airspace." ...|$|E

Two days later, as they approach the waters off Mecca, a sambuk owned by one of Rastapopoulos' contacts briefly boards the Ramona and <b>checks</b> <b>out</b> one of the Africans, only to be chased off after Tintin and Haddock realize the true purpose of the voyage. [...] After some negotiations with the Africans, Haddock announces that the Ramona will take them to Djibouti in Africa instead. [...] However, having been alerted by the Mecca contact, Rastapopoulos sends a U-Boat to destroy the Ramona, with the ship taking evasive manoeuvres to survive, ultimately being rescued by the cruiser USS Los Angeles. The Los Angeles chases down the Scheherazade and attempts to capture Rastapopoulos, but he fakes his own death and escapes via a mini-submarine. Tintin, Haddock and Snowy return to Belgium and learn that the Emir has recaptured Khemed and that Abdullah can return home (one of the news articles also reveals that General Alcazar has used his Mosquitos to successfully overthrow General Tapioca in San Theodoros). Their relaxation is cut short by Jolyon Wagg, who has arranged to use Marlinspike for an auto rally.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the weeks}} that followed, Denton's friends, {{business}} associates and neighbors began asking Peete, who {{was the last person}} to see him alive, of his whereabouts. Peete gave several stories to explain Denton's absence including a story that Denton was on an extended business trip in various locations and would return shortly. [...] Meanwhile, she continued to spend Denton's money and also began driving his Cadillac. She pawned his jewelry and possessions, rented rooms in his mansion and collected the rent money. Peete also convinced tenants of Denton's rental properties in Phoenix to make their rent <b>checks</b> <b>out</b> to her. In August, Peete charged two expensive dresses at Bullock's department store in Denton's name claiming to be his wife. Around this time, Denton's teenage daughter hired an attorney in an effort to find out her father's whereabouts. The attorney questioned Peete, who said she did not know where Denton was, but agreed to forward his financial and business documents as soon as possible. The following month, Peete rented Denton's mansion out and returned to her husband and daughter in Denver. With Peete out of the home, Denton's family were finally able to search the premises. On September 23, a private detective hired by the attorney Denton's daughter had retained searched the home. Jacob Denton's decomposing body was found buried {{in the basement of the}} home in a wooden cubicle under the stairs. An autopsy showed that he had been shot in the head and strangled. His body was bound in numerous cords and wrapped in a quilt. Police tracked Peete down in Denver and questioned her about Denton's murder. She maintained that she was not involved, but offered different scenarios to explain his death. Peete claimed that the unidentified [...] "mysterious Spanish woman" [...] with whom Denton supposedly argued and been shot in the right arm by was his killer. This theory was quickly dismissed as Denton's body was found with his right arm uninjured—and still attached, despite Peete's claim that the injury had required amputation. Peete then claimed that the body was not Denton but that of a double whom Denton had killed. Peete was brought back to Los Angeles and was indicted on one charge of first-degree murder.
