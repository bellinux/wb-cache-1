5|$|In {{cases where}} surgery is not indicated, palliative {{chemotherapy}} is an option; higher-dose chemotherapy {{is associated with}} longer survival. Palliative chemotherapy, particularly using <b>capecitabine</b> and gemcitabine, is also often used to treat recurrent endometrial cancer.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of cases of cholangiocarcinoma present as inoperable (unresectable) disease in which case patients are generally treated with palliative chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy. Chemotherapy {{has been shown in}} a randomized controlled trial to improve quality of life and extend survival in patients with inoperable cholangiocarcinoma. There is no single chemotherapy regimen which is universally used, and enrollment in clinical trials is often recommended when possible. Chemotherapy agents used to treat cholangiocarcinoma include 5-fluorouracil with leucovorin, gemcitabine as a single agent, or gemcitabine plus cisplatin, irinotecan, or <b>capecitabine.</b> A small pilot study suggested possible benefit from the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib in patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Most {{chemotherapy}} {{is delivered}} intravenously, although {{a number of}} agents can be administered orally (e.g., melphalan, busulfan, <b>capecitabine).</b>|$|E
25|$|Important role (David Cameron as joint global Chief Investigator) in {{the pivotal}} {{clinical}} trial that tested {{the hypothesis that}} the combination of lapatinib and the cytotoxic drug <b>capecitabine</b> would be superior to <b>capecitabine</b> alone in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer that had progressed despite trastuzumab treatment. The results of this trial has led to a global (more than 100 countries) marketing authorisation of the drug lapatinib produced by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline.|$|E
25|$|The {{anti-cancer}} medication <b>capecitabine</b> {{may cause}} {{the loss of}} fingerprints. Swelling of the fingers, such as that caused by bee stings, will in some cases cause the temporary disappearance of fingerprints, though they will return when the swelling recedes.|$|E
25|$|Premedication with {{corticosteroids}} {{is recommended}} before each administration of docetaxel to reduce fluid retention and hypersensitive reactions. Other medications will often {{be given to}} aid pain management and other symptoms. The treatment of breast cancer with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is enhanced by adjuvant treatment with docetaxel. Docetaxel is also used in combination with <b>capecitabine,</b> a DNA synthesis inhibitor.|$|E
25|$|The anti-folates include {{methotrexate}} and pemetrexed. Methotrexate inhibits {{dihydrofolate reductase}} (DHFR), an enzyme that regenerates tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate. When the enzyme is inhibited by methotrexate, the cellular levels of folate coenzymes diminish. These {{are required for}} thymidylate and purine production, which are both essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. Pemetrexed is another anti-metabolite that affects purine and pyrimidine production, and therefore also inhibits DNA synthesis. It primarily inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase, but also has effects on DHFR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. The fluoropyrimidines include fluorouracil and <b>capecitabine.</b> Fluorouracil is a nucleobase analogue that is metabolised in cells to form at least two active products; 5-fluourouridine monophosphate (FUMP) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate (fdUMP). FUMP becomes incorporated into RNA and fdUMP inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase; both of which lead to cell death. <b>Capecitabine</b> is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil that is broken down in cells to produce the active drug. The deoxynucleoside analogues include cytarabine, gemcitabine, decitabine, azacitidine, fludarabine, nelarabine, cladribine, clofarabine, and pentostatin. The thiopurines include thioguanine and mercaptopurine.|$|E
25|$|Pre-treatment with {{corticosteroids}} {{has been}} used to decrease hypersensitivity reactions and oedema in response to docetaxel and has shown no effect on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. The efficacy of docetaxel was improved by treatment with oral <b>capecitabine,</b> and after more than 27 months follow-up the survival benefit has been confirmed. Doxorubicin was combined with docetaxel in one study of 24 patients and resulted in an increased AUC of docetaxel by 50 to 70%, indicating doxorubicin may affect the disposition of docetaxel. Etoposide has also been shown to decrease docetaxel clearance, though patient numbers for this observation have been low.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy {{depends on}} the tumor type, but tends to be cisplatin-based (or {{carboplatin}} or oxaliplatin) every three weeks with fluorouracil (5-FU) either continuously or every three weeks. In more recent studies, addition of epirubicin was better than other comparable regimens in advanced nonresectable cancer. Chemotherapy may be given after surgery (adjuvant, i.e. to reduce risk of recurrence), before surgery (neoadjuvant) or if surgery is not possible; in this case, cisplatin and 5-FU are used. Ongoing trials compare various combinations of chemotherapy; the phase II/III REAL-2 trial – for example – compares four regimens containing epirubicin and either cisplatin or oxaliplatin, and either continuously infused fluorouracil or <b>capecitabine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|As of December 7, 2012, Mesupron, a small {{molecule}} {{serine protease}} inhibitor {{developed by the}} WILEX pharmaceutical company, has completed phase II trials.

5000|$|A 2006 GSK-supported {{randomized}} {{clinical trial}} on female breast cancer previously being treated with those agents (anthracycline, a taxane and trastuzumab) demonstrated that administrating lapatinib {{in combination with}} <b>capecitabine</b> delayed the time of further cancer growth compared to regimens that use <b>capecitabine</b> alone. The study also reported that risk of disease progression was reduced by 51%, and that the combination therapy {{was not associated with}} increases in toxic side effects. [...] The outcome of this study resulted in a somewhat complex and rather specific initial indication for lapatinib—use only in combination with <b>capecitabine</b> for HER2-positive breast cancer in women whose cancer have progressed following previous chemotherapy with anthracycline, taxanes and trastuzumab.|$|E
50|$|If {{cancer has}} spread to the lymph nodes or distant organs, which {{is the case with}} stage III and stage IV colon cancer respectively, adding {{chemotherapy}} agents fluorouracil, <b>capecitabine</b> or oxaliplatin increases life expectancy. If the lymph nodes do not contain cancer, the benefits of chemotherapy are controversial. If the cancer is widely metastatic or unresectable, treatment is then palliative. Typically in this setting, a number of different chemotherapy medications may be used. Chemotherapy drugs for this condition may include <b>capecitabine,</b> fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin and UFT. The drugs <b>capecitabine</b> and fluorouracil are interchangeable, with <b>capecitabine</b> being an oral medication while fluorouracil being an intravenous medicine. Some specific regimens used for CRC are FOLFOX, FOLFOXIRI, and FOLFIRI. Antiangiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab are often added in first line therapy. Another class of drugs used in the second line setting are epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, of which the two FDA approved ones are cetuximab and panitumumab.|$|E

50|$|<b>Capecitabine</b> is metabolised to 5-FU {{which in}} turn is a {{thymidylate}} synthase inhibitor, hence inhibiting the synthesis of thymidine monophosphate (ThMP), the active form of thymidine which is required for the de novo synthesis of DNA.|$|E

50|$|<b>Capecitabine,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Xeloda among others, is a {{chemotherapy}} medication used to treat breast cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer. For breast cancer it is often used together with docetaxel. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|However, {{thymidine}} phosphorylase {{has also}} been found to play {{an essential role in}} the activation of the anti-cancer drug <b>capecitabine.</b> Specifically, it converts the intermediate metabolite 5’-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine in tumors to 5-fluorouracil, which acts as a thymidylate synthase inhibitor.|$|E
