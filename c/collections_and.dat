5|$|Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899– July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, {{short story}} writer, and journalist. His {{economical}} and understated style {{had a strong}} influence on 20th-century fiction, while his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short story <b>collections,</b> <b>and</b> two non-fiction works. Additional works, including three novels, four short story <b>collections,</b> <b>and</b> three non-fiction works, were published posthumously. Many of his works are considered classics of American literature.|$|E

40|$|Plato {{describes}} {{a way of}} reasoning that comprises two complementary operations, <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> division. <b>Collection</b> unifies many into one while division divides one into many. In other words, while collection brings together many parts into a whole, division divides a whole into many parts. While Plato goes into some detail in his observations on <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> division, several questions remain unanswered. More specifically, {{the means by which}} <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> division operate, their product, and their relation to deductive and non-deductive reasoning are uncertain. The {{purpose of this study is}} to shed light on <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> division by defending the following thesis: <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> division define logical frameworks that underlie both deductive and non-deductive reasoning. Chapter 1 will introduce <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> division by reviewing recent literature, defining key terms, and discussing illustrations of <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> division in the dialogues. Chapter 2 will explain how <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> division define logical frameworks through three operations: seeing, naming, and placing. These operations will be discussed in terms of their relations to reasoning about wholes and parts. Chapter 3 will present four models for interpreting the logical structures that are produced by <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> division. It will present the argument that <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> division define non-hierarchical structures of overlapping parts. Chapter 4 will present the argument that <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> division define whole-part relations that underlie deductive reasoning on the one hand, and the formulation of definitions in dialogues such as the Sophist and the Statesman on the other. Chapter 5 will explore the relation between <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> division and non-deductive reasoning. It will present the argument that Meno’s definition of virtue and Euthyphro’s definition of piety are formulated using <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> division. Chapter 6 will provide a summary of key points from the preceding chapters and discuss unanswered questions and avenues for future research...|$|R
