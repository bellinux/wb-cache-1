And especially here, in situations of general openness, this dialogue is of vital significance to a deliberative democracy [24]. Mode 3 orientation asks for the possibilities to orient this democratic conflict by diverse and probably strongly divergent statements – a task which seems to be almost paradoxical.|$|E
40|$|The {{parallel}} {{understanding of}} dissolved organic matters (DOM) impact on trace metal speciation in soil and root {{ability to change}} DOM concentration and composition in the rhizosphere strongly suggests a substantial alteration of metal binding capacity of DOM in the rhizosphere, with consequent impacts on metal phytoavailability. This hypothesis is investigated in the present communication {{on the basis of}} two independent set of experiments. Both experiments used the RHIZOtest experimental set-up, which enables an easy and fast recovery of both plants (i. e. shoots and roots) and rhizosphere, to grown either lettuce (Lactuca sativa) or durum wheat (Triticum turgidum durum) on two different soil samples notably varying in pH, organic matter content and geographical origin (tropical vs. temperate area). Usual chemical properties (i. e. pH, concentration of DOM, major cations/anions and metals) and free copper activity were measured in the rhizosphere solution. Copper speciation was then modelled in the rhizosphere solution with the humic ion-binding model VI (Model VI) by adjusting the metal binding capacity of DOM to fit experimental data. Compared with bulk soil measurements, a large increase in both pH and DOM concentration was observed in durum wheat rhizosphere while these two parameters did not change significantly in lettuce rhizosphere. Alternatively, the fraction of DOM involved in copper binding decreased similarly by 40 % in both durum wheat and lettuce rhizosphere. These very <b>convergent</b> <b>pictures</b> of a decrease in metal binding capacity of DOM in both experiments lead to discuss the hypothetical governing mechanisms and the genericity of this finding...|$|E
40|$|A core {{property}} of human semantic processing is the rapid, facilitatory influence of prior input on extracting themeaning of what comes next, even under conditions ofminimal awareness. Previous work {{has shown a}} number of neurophysiological indices of this facilitation, but the mapping between time course and localization—critical for separating automatic semantic facilitation from other mecha-nisms—has thus far been unclear. In the current study, we used a multimodal imaging approach to isolate early, bottom-up effects of context on semantic memory, acquiring a combination of electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and func-tional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements in the same individuals with a masked semantic priming paradigm. Across techniques, the results provide a strikingly <b>convergent</b> <b>picture</b> of early automatic semantic facilitation. Event-related potentials demon-strated early sensitivity to semantic association between 300 and 500 ms;MEG localized the differential neural response within this time window to the left anterior temporal cortex, and fMRI localized the effect more precisely to the left anterior superior temporal gyrus, a region previously implicated in semantic associative processing. However, fMRI diverged from early EEG/MEG measures in revealing semantic enhancement effects within frontal and parietal regions, perhaps reflecting downstream attempts to consciously access th...|$|R
40|$|Background: Mariner {{elements}} {{represent the}} most successful family of autonomous DNA transposons, being present in various plant and animal genomes, including humans. The introduction and co-evolution of mariners within host genomes imply a strict regulation of the transposon activity. Biochemical data accumulated {{during the past decade}} have led to a <b>convergent</b> <b>picture</b> of the transposition cycle of mariner elements, suggesting that mariner transposition does not rely on host-specific factors. This model does not account for differences of transposition efficiency in human cells between mariners. We thus wondered whether apparent similarities in transposition cycle could hide differences in the intrinsic parameters that control mariner transposition. Principal Findings: We find that Mos 1 transposase concentrations in excess to the Mos 1 ends prevent the paired-end complex assembly. However, we observe that Mos 1 transposition is not impaired by transposase high concentration, dismissing the idea that transposase over production plays an obligatory role in the down-regulation of mariner transposition. Our main finding is that the paired-end complex is formed in a cooperative way, regardless of the transposase concentration. We also show that an element framed by two identical ITRs (Inverted Terminal Repeats) is more efficient in driving transposition than an element framed by two different ITRs (i. e. the natural Mos 1 copy), the latter being more sensitive to transposase concentration variations. Finally, we show that the current Mos 1 ITRs correspond to the ancestra...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims Addiction is {{associated}} with severe economic and social consequences and personal tragedies, the scientific exploration of which draws upon investigations at the molecular, cellular and systems levels {{with a wide variety}} of technologies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been key to mapping effects observed at the microscopic and mesoscopic scales. The range of measurements from this apparatus has opened new avenues linking neurobiology to behaviour. This review considers the role of MRI in addiction research, and what future technological improvements might offer. Methods A hermeneutic strategy supplemented by an expansive, systematic search of PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases, covering from database inception to October 2015, with a conjunction of search terms relevant to addiction and MRI. Formal meta-analyses were prioritized. Results Results from methods that probe brain structure and function suggest frontostriatal circuitry disturbances within specific cognitive domains, some of which predict drug relapse and treatment response. New methods of processing imaging data are opening opportunities for understanding the role of cerebral vasculature, a global view of brain communication and the complex topology of the cortical surface and drug action. Future technological advances include increases in MRI field strength, with concomitant improvements in image quality. Conclusions The magnetic resonance imaging literature provides a limited but <b>convergent</b> <b>picture</b> of the neurobiology of addiction as global changes to brain structure and functional disturbances to frontostriatal circuitry, accompanied by changes in anterior white matter...|$|R
40|$|Conformational {{changes at}} supramolecular {{interfaces}} are fundamentally coupled to binding activity, yet {{it remains a}} challenge to probe this relationship directly. Within the nuclear pore complex, this underlies how transport receptors known as karyopherins proceed through a tethered layer of intrinsically disordered nucleoporin domains containing Phe-Gly (FG) -rich repeats (FG domains) that otherwise hinder passive transport. Here, we use nonspecific proteins (i. e., BSA) as innate molecular probes to explore FG domain conformational changes by surface plasmon resonance. This mathematically diminishes the surface plasmon resonance refractive index constraint, thereby providing the means to acquire and correlate height changes in a surface-tethered FG domain layer to Kap binding affinities in situ {{with respect to their}} relative spatial arrangements. Stepwise measurements show that FG domain collapse is caused by karyopherin β 1 (Kapβ 1) binding at low concentrations, but this gradually transitions into a reextension at higher Kapβ 1 concentrations. This ability to self-heal is intimately coupled to Kapβ 1 -FG binding avidity that promotes the maximal incorporation of Kapβ 1 into the FG domain layer. Further increasing Kapβ 1 to physiological concentrations leads to a "pileup" of Kapβ 1 molecules that bind weakly to unoccupied FG repeats {{at the top of the}} layer. Therefore, binding avidity does not hinder fast transport per se. Revealing the biophysical basis underlying the form-function relationship of Kapβ 1 -FG domain behavior results in a <b>convergent</b> <b>picture</b> in which transport and mechanistic aspects of nuclear pore complex functionality are reconciled...|$|R
40|$|The action {{research}} methodology {{and several of}} its methods have previously been highlighted and described by the authors as a fitting and rigorous framework approach for complex waste management systems.   This {{was in response to}} criticism of the ex ante selection of traditional empiric systems analysis tools to provide decision support and ‘sustainable improvement’ in such complex systems which often involve strong human and political factors.    Several of the {{action research}} methods described have recently been utilized in a case study around mineral (aggregate) construction and demolition waste in the Stockholm region.   These methods were integrated through a series of workshops and work areas undergone together with project members from several private and public sectors.   Leaving the problem fuzzy (loosely defined) in the beginning; utilizing <b>convergent</b> interviewing, rich <b>pictures</b> and focus groups allowed the researchers and partner stakeholders to identify not one but several problem areas within the system of focus.   Indicator creation and a dialectic processes were then used to identify qualitative and quantitative aspects of salience around these problem areas.   These resulting indicators were strengthened through a process of verification.   Each indicator was then analyzed by what was deemed to be appropriate and transparent means.   It is argued that this approach may create better communication, transparency, and understanding by the stakeholders.   These factors in turn allowing stronger stakeholder ownership of the process and assisting in more informed decisions and help to provide stability for desired change. However the process was not without its drawbacks such as intense communication and time requirements. QC 20120110 Project BR...|$|R
