50|$|Cooking {{could also}} kill parasites, {{reduce the amount}} of energy {{required}} for chewing and digestion, and release more nutrients from plants and meat. Due to the difficulty of chewing raw meat and digesting tough proteins (e.g. collagen) and carbohydrates, the development of cooking served as an effective mechanism to efficiently process meat and allow for its consumption in larger quantities. With its high <b>caloric</b> <b>density</b> and store of important nutrients, meat thus became a staple in the diet of early humans. By increasing digestibility, cooking allowed hominids to maximize the energy gained from consuming foods. Studies show that caloric intake from cooking starches improves 12-35% and 45-78% for protein. As a result of the increases in net energy gain from food consumption, survival and reproductive rates in hominids increased.|$|E

40|$|Extensive {{seasonal}} sea ice reduction has {{highlighted the}} need to evaluate the status and potential long term changes of highly productive benthic communities in the Pacific Arctic Region. Walrus that use sea ice to access offshore feeding areas are now being forced to haul out on land {{for part of the}} year, requiring them to forage for benthic prey from closer to shore. To explore this energetic problem, I conducted a caloric survey of benthic invertebrates, and evaluated relationships between caloric content and environmental variables. Latitude was the strongest non-taxonomic dependency for caloric content (ANOVA p= 0. 003 with taxon dependencies, p< 0. 001 without). Cluster analysis revealed <b>caloric</b> <b>densities</b> were higher in offshore, high nutrient Bering Sea Anadyr Water, and lower in nearshore, low nutrient Alaska Coastal Water.

50|$|In {{addition}} to a food's expiration date, the main considerations for hiking food are water content, <b>caloric</b> <b>density</b> (more energy per pound for a given space), and nutritional density (more nutrition per pound for a given space). Water weighs one gram per cubic centimeter, or 8.33 pounds per gallon, so a 4-liter (1 gallon) food container can weigh up to eight pounds less when it contains dehydrated food. Dehydrating foods can reduce weight and may reduce nutrition while increasing the need for water to reconstitute the food. More weight also expends more energy, so packing lighter foods reduces {{the need for more}} calories. Calories equate to energy. Nutrition becomes more important as the number of hiking days increases; for example MREs are not intended to be used beyond ten days. Multi-vitamins may help offset some nutrition deficiencies.|$|E

We used diet data for largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, to compare a caloric-based approach with eight diet indices: percent frequency of occurrence, percent total number, percent total weight, mean relative number, mean relative volume, relative importance index, prey-importance index, and mean stomach fullness. Mean caloric contribution of stomach contents for each prey taxon {{was used as a}} standard to compare diet indices. Temporal differences in composition and caloric contents of largemouth bass stomach contents were apparent. Most diet indices provided similar assessments when diets were dominated by a single prey type (i. e., gizzard shad during June-October). However, diet indices evaluated provided dissimilar assessments of stomach contents when a variety of prey with differing <b>caloric</b> <b>densities</b> were consumed (e. g., April). Mean stomach fullness and percent by volume were significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 002) correlated (r = 0. 94 - 1. 00) with mean caloric contribution of largemouth bass stomach contents during all months. Unlike percent by weight, mean stomach fullness accounted for differences in fish size and stomach capacity.

The spatial (littoral and pelagic) and temporal (diurnal and seasonal) distribution and diet of Hypseleotris was examined following the addition of 100, 000 piscivorous Australian Bass (Macquaria novemaculeata) to Maroon Dam {{in the summer of}} 1998 / 99. A strong spatial and temporal ontogeny was observed, with smaller (20 mm SL) remaining in the littoral throughout the day and night. Spatial ontogeny affected diet also, with fish consuming a decreasing proportion of zooplankton and an increasing proportion of macro-invertebrates as fish length increased and habitat use changed. A bioenergetics model was constructed to examine these distribution and diet patterns. Laboratory derived consumption and respiration parameters were combined with <b>caloric</b> <b>densities</b> and commonly accepted excretion and activity scalars to produce modeled growth estimates that were validated against Hypseleotris age-at-growth data collected from a diversity of habitats. Using this model, it was concluded that the spatial and temporal ontogeny and diet of Hypseleotris in Maroon Dam described the most energetically advantageous life history. Unlike many zooplanktivores in northern hemisphere lakes, Hypseleotris did not appear to engage in migratory predator avoidance behaviour. This is discussed in a context of Australia's paucity of pelagic piscivores.

A: 13 CO 2 excretion was independent of caloric load (P = 0. 59). B: The dynamic of 13 CO 2 excretion was modulated by tracer elimination which was in turn dependent on the speed of tracer delivery, i. e. with faster deliveries resulting in lower 13 CO 2 recovery during infusion (P < 0. 001). C: Increasing Ac doses resulted in decreased 13 CO 2 recovery (P < 0. 001) over the first hour. 13 CO 2 recovery kinetics was independent of the volume delivered. This study shows 13 C-acetate absorption and metabolism is independent of the volume and caloric delivery of test meals.

40|$|Obesity Due to Poor Snack Choices and Lack of Physical Activity A chronic {{issue in}} my {{immediate}} community, Murray State University, is obesity due to unhealthy diets and a generally lethargic lifestyle. The muffin picture represents the average healthiness of snacks available on campus. While students are working towards their education on campus {{it has become}} increasingly difficult to acquire snacks that are both convenient and health conscious. Places such as the T-Room cater towards less healthy foods by making them far more available and also making them much less expensive. For a student to get a quick lunch consisting of a grilled cheese, fries, and soft drink the price is 8. 48 while if that same student wanted a ready-made cobb salad with turkey, a water, a sausage and cheese stick pack, and a fruit dip cup the price would cost 11. 36. Both of these meals are similar in their respective <b>caloric</b> <b>densities</b> but meal one has a far less healthy macro balance, being high in fats and carbs, and is also fried or cooked with a lot of butter. Furthermore, the amount of sugar in the soft drink has its own health implications as well. These factors lead to students putting on unhealthy weight and the unhealthy food also does not fuel the body well for physical activity. Leading on to my community asset I posted a picture of me in D. C. I work as a personal trainer at a local gym Downtown Dynabody and I have worked as a group fitness instructor at the MSU wellness center for a number of years. During my time a a fitness professional I have worked with many people to help change their views of what it takes to become fit, promote working towards a better version of themselves, and I have helped a few people reach fitness goals beyond what they believed possible. My job as personal trainer is to be 2 ̆ 2 team motivation 2 ̆ 2 as well as to listen to my clients, adapt their training to optimize its effectiveness, and to teach them how to so things properly. By doing my part working with the few clients I have, I am able to also influence those who come in contact with my clients. People see others in the community making healthy life changes to better their health, lose weight, and improve their body image and the idea that it is obtainable for them as well spreads like wild fire. Case based examples in the community as well as changing the community views of obesity are crucial in fighting this epidemic. To combat the obesity problem at MSU a two-part challenge is set before us. Both a physical aspect, stressing the importance of being more physically active, and the nutritional aspect, eating correctly and having healthy food available to busy students. Using community ambassadors, community based challenges, and using the assets at our disposal can help change the trend of the 2 ̆ 2 freshman 152 ̆ 2 or worse the 2 ̆ 2 sophomore 302 ̆ 2.

Recent {{genome-wide}} association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near over a dozen genes {{that are related to}} body mass index (BMI). Despite the association of these SNPs with BMI, the mechanism by which they influence the determination of body weight is not yet known. Recently, the fat- mass and obesity-associated (FTO) obesity SNP was related to energy intake and preference for foods of high <b>caloric</b> <b>density</b> in children. FTO genotype was not associated with resting energy expenditure. We have extended this type of analysis to eating behaviors in the morbidly obese...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHuman {{obesity is}} a global epidemic, which causes a rapidly {{increased}} frequency of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. One reason for obesity is the ready availability of refined food products with high <b>caloric</b> <b>density,</b> an evolutionarily new event, which makes over consumption of food inevitable. Fat is a food product with high <b>caloric</b> <b>density.</b> The mechanism for regulation of fat intake has therefore been studied to a great extent. Such {{studies have shown that}} as long as fat stays in the intestine, satiety is promoted. This occurs through the fat released peptide hormones, the best known being cholecystokinin, CCK, which is released by fatty acids. Hence, retarded fat digestion with prolonged time for delivery of fatty acids promote satiety. Pancreatic lipase, together with its protein cofactor, colipase, is the main enzymatic system responsible for intestinal fat digestion. We found that biological membranes, isolated from plants, animals or bacteria, inhibit the lipase/colipase-catalysed hydrolysis of triglycerides even in the presence of bile salt. We propose that the inhibition is due to binding of lipase/colipase to the membranes and adsorption of the membranes to the aqueous/triglyceride interface, thereby hindering lipase/colipase from acting on its lipid substrate. We also found that chloroplast membranes (thylakoids), when added to refined food, suppressed food intake in rats, lowered blood lipids and raised the satiety hormones, CCK and enterostatin. Consequently, the mechanism for satiety seems to be retardation of fat digestion allowing the fat products to stay longer in the intestine...|$|E
40|$|Diet {{can affect}} a {{spectrum}} of biological processes ranging from behavior to cellular metabolism. Yet, the precise role of an individual dietary constituent can be a difficult variable to isolate experimentally. A chemically defined food (CDF) permits the systematic evaluation of individual macro- and micronutrients. In addition, CDF facilitates the direct comparison of data obtained independently from different laboratories. Here, we report the development and characterization of a CDF for Drosophila. We show that CDF can support the long-term culture of laboratory strains and demonstrate that this formulation has utility in isolating macronutrient from <b>caloric</b> <b>density</b> requirements in studies of development, longevity and reproduction...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} overweight and obesity in 10 - to 14 -year-old schoolchildren from both public (state and municipal) and private educational network of Campo Grande-MS, and to verify the association between anthropometric data, physical activity, alimentary habits, sexual maturation and type of school. Methods: The sample was composed of 941 students from public and private school, whose anthropometric data was evaluated by the Body Mass Index and Cole’s classification. The body composition was obtained through the body fat percentage and the habits of physical activity were assessed. Dietary habits were raised through questions about frequency of consumption of foods with high <b>caloric</b> <b>density,</b> vegetables, legumes and fruits and the habit of eating while watching television. Results: The study identified 217 (23. 1...|$|E
40|$|Obesity {{leads to}} changes in the gut {{microbial}} community which contribute to the metabolic dysregulation in obesity. Dietary fat and fiber affect the <b>caloric</b> <b>density</b> of foods. The impact of dietary fat content and fiber type on the microbial community in the hind gut is unknown. Effect of dietary fat level and fiber type on hindgut microbiota and volatile fatty acid (VFA) profiles was investigated. Expression of metabolic marker genes in the gut, adipose tissue and liver was determined. A 2 × 2 experiment was conducted in pigs fed at two dietary fat levels (5 % or 17. 5 % swine grease) and two fiber types (4 % inulin, fermentable fructo-oligosaccharide or 4 % solka floc, non-fermentable cellulose). High fat diets (HFD) resulted in a higher (...|$|E

Nestling eastern bluebirds {{experience}} adrop in live mass after 13 days of age; however, {{dry mass}} continues to increase. 2. <b>Caloric</b> <b>density</b> and body concentrations of Fe, Mg, and Na remain constant, Ca and N concentrations increase, and K concentration decreases with nestling age.

INTRODU(YION Nutritional budgets involving nestling passerine birds are mostly limited to caloric economies (O’Conner, 1983; Ricklefs, 1984). Caloric economies are, how-ever, {{only one aspect of}} nutrition associated with growth. In addition to caloric requirements, knowl...|$|E
40|$|Fat is an {{important}} dietary component for all animals, including humans, {{by virtue of its}} high <b>caloric</b> <b>density,</b> its ability to supply essential fatty acids for essential structural components, and to carry fat-soluble vitamins. Fat is also the most important form of energy storage in the body because of its high caloric value, storage with minimum weight per unit of calorie, and without appre-Siable amounts of water or minerals. Energy derived from the oxidation of fat from exogenous or endogenous sources can maintain physiological processes essential to sustain life. The transformation of fat into utilizable energy involves lipolysis of lipid to free fatty acids (FFA) and the subsequent P-oxidation in the mitochondria; the entrance of fatty acids into mitochondria from cytoplasm requires the esterification of energy substrates with car...|$|E
40|$|In 3 {{experiments}} {{with a total}} of 72 male albino Wistar or Sprague-Dawley rats, liquid or solid diets differing in carbohydrate or triglyceride content were presented 1 at a time to each S once or twice a day. For a given S, each <b>caloric</b> <b>density</b> consistently had a particular odor and/or taste. Results show the size of the feeding bout on the dilute nutrient became larger than that on the more concentrated nutrient after several pairs of presentations. This differentiation was at least partly controlled by the oral cues which had been paired with nutrient differences. Results were attributable to acquired differences in the development of feeding inhibition during the meal, and not to original or acquired differences in initial rate of feeding or in the preference for 1 diet over the other in 2 stimulus tests...|$|E
