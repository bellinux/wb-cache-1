This provides a method to transform every decoding algorithm of surface codes into a decoding algorithm of <b>color</b> <b>codes.</b> Applying this idea to a family of hexagonal <b>color</b> <b>codes,</b> with the perfect matching decoding algorithm for the three corresponding surface codes, we find a phase error threshold of approximately 8. 7 %. Finally, our approach enables us to establish a general lower bound on the error threshold of a family of <b>color</b> <b>codes</b> depending on the threshold of the three corresponding surface codes. These results are based on a chain complex interpretation of surface <b>codes</b> and <b>color</b> <b>codes.</b> ...|$|R

To take advantage of this program, offenders have to plead guilty to the charge, agree to take part in treatment, regular drug screenings, and regular reporting to the drug court judge for a minimum of one year, as well as pay heavy fines and monthly drug court fees.
