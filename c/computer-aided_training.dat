In particular, we focus on how efficiently discriminant analysis can {{reduce the number of}} features and increase classification performance. A nonlinear counterpart of Linear Discriminant Analysis, which is a general purpose class specific feature extractor, is presented where the nonlinearization is carried out by employing the so-called ’kernel-idea’. Then, we examine how this nonlinear extraction technique affects the efficiency of learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machines. 1 Speech Impediment Therapy and Real-Time Phoneme Classification This paper deals with {{the application of}} speech recognition to the <b>computer-aided</b> <b>training</b> of the speech and hearing handicapped.

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} ongoing {{research in}} the development of speech technologies that strives to raise the efficacy of <b>computer-aided</b> pronunciation <b>training,</b> especially for Chinese learners of English. Our approach is grounded on the theory of language transfer and involves a systematic phonological comparison between the primary language (L 1 being Chinese) and secondary language (L 2 being English) to predict possible segmental and suprasegmental realizations that constitute mispronunciations in L 2 English. The predictions are validated based on a specially designed corpus that consists of several hundred hours of L 2 English speech. The speech data supports the development of automatic speech recognition technologies that can detect and diagnose mispronunciations. The diagnosis aims to support the design of pedagogical and remedial instructions, which involves text-tospeech synthesis technologies in audiovisual forms. ...|$|R

Coefficients needed for calculations are in the next tables. The next tables contain also technological and design limitations.

40|$|We {{study the}} use of a {{statistical}} phone duration model for separating intact utterances from corrupted ones in a computer-assisted pronunciation training system. Our system performs forced alignment between the input utterance and the canonical transcription of the prompted text. Intact utterances contain spoken content that correspond to the text prompt. For these utterances, our system performs detailed phonetic analysis of the alignment and generates corrective feedback to highlight the occurrence of phonetic errors. Corrupted utterances result from disfluencies, truncated recordings, or spoken content that does not correspond to the text prompt. For these cases, the appropriate feedback is to invite the user to record again. We develop a filtering mechanism for intact input utterances by means of phone duration modeling.
