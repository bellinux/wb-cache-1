25|$|The M.52's single pilot, who, for the {{intended}} first flight, {{would have been}} test pilot Eric Brown, would have flown the aircraft from a small cockpit which was set inside the shock cone at {{the nose of the}} aircraft. The pressurised cockpit, in which the pilot would have had to fly the aircraft in a semi-prone position, was complete with a <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen</b> that was aligned with the contours of the bullet-shaped nose. In the event of an emergency, the entire section could be jettisoned, the separation from the rest of aircraft being initiated via multiple cordite-based explosive bolts. Air pressure would force the detached capsule off the fuselage while a parachute would slow its descent; during the capsule's descent, the pilot would bail out at a lower altitude and then parachute to safety. In order to serve its role as a research aircraft, the M.52 was to be equipped with comprehensive flight instrumentation, including automated instrument recorders and strain gauging throughout the structure connected to an oscilloscope.|$|E
2500|$|... {{of armor}} plate was fitted {{to the cockpit}} and a [...] bullet-resistant glass screen was fitted behind the <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Dassault {{launched}} the FNX at the 2001 Paris Air Show, {{aiming for a}} 10,500km (5,700nm) range at Mach 0.88 up from the Falcon 900EX 8,300km at Mach 0.84. Its new high-speed wing is 1.86m (6.10ft) wider and with 5° higher wing sweep than the 900 wing, its 20% longer fuselage is keeping the same cabin cross-section but with a new <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen.</b> The trijet have a combined thrust of 18,000lb (80kN) to be provided by Honeywell FX5, a new design, or a Pratt & Whitney Canada PW306 growth version. Based on Honeywell Primus Epic avionics, its EASy cockpit is developed for the Falcon 2000EX and 900EX and controls are fly-by-wire. Scheduled to fly in 2004, first deliveries were planned for mid-2006.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Bedford CA ambulance. <b>Curved</b> <b>windscreens</b> were {{expensive}} {{in the early}} 1950s, and until 1958 the CA used a [...] "split-screen" [...] windscreen.|$|R
50|$|Smaller (sub 7.5 tonnes) A class {{vehicles}} {{are also popular}} in Europe, similar in size to Overcab Coachbuilts, but without the base vehicles cab. In its place, a (wider) cab is added, which allows for a drop-down bed to be fitted above. Recognisable by their large <b>curved</b> <b>windscreens.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1st series units {{originally}} had <b>curved</b> <b>windscreens,</b> replaced in the 1980s by flat glas, later used on 2nd and 3rd series units. The locomotives have a Bo'Bo' wheel arrangement {{with a maximum}} allowed speed is 130 km/h. Like most FS stock, some D.445 have received the XMPR color scheme (white, green, blue).|$|R
2500|$|The {{production}} {{version of}} the Panorama, with 41 seats as standard, was introduced at the 1958 Commercial Motor Show, as an addition to the existing range, available in one form only – on underfloor-engined chassis with the entrance ahead of the front axle. In common with the new Consort III and IV, it had a new silver-effect dished oval grill with a chrome flash through the middle, and a <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen</b> with a central division. The original Panorama's short window immediately behind the entrance door was removed and encapsulated into the first bay, and the difference in level between the waistline and the rear window was accommodated by a stylish [...] "kick-up" [...] at the rear. The design then received minor modifications {{over the next two}} years.|$|E
5000|$|... 150 lb {{of armor}} plate was fitted {{to the cockpit}} and a 1.5 in bullet-resistant glass screen was fitted behind the <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Two {{variants}} existed, the Palatine I (known as [...] "Palatine" [...] before 1992) {{which had}} a flatter windscreen, and the Palatine II (launched in 1993) {{which had a}} <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen</b> with an arched top resembling that of the single-decker Northern Counties Paladin.|$|E
50|$|Very early {{types of}} bus {{could still be}} found but no longer in service, with a front engine mounted in an {{extended}} bonneted nose, {{in the style of}} some conventional trucks. The majority of classic Malta buses had elaborate grilles and headlight arrangements, <b>curved</b> <b>windscreens</b> and sloping roofs. Later makes of bus were usually of conventional bus and coach designs that were in use elsewhere in the world, such as Plaxton Supreme and Duple Dominant bodywork.|$|R
50|$|There {{was also}} {{activity}} in the single decker fleet. Some of the AEC Regal IV RFs had been refurbished in the 1960s, with twin headlights, <b>curved</b> <b>windscreens,</b> new side mouldings and improved interiors, mainly allocated to Green Line services. There were 14 Willowbrook bodied AEC Reliances at Hertford garage, which had been bought by London Transport in 1965. By 1975 they were on bus work, which some thought was idiosyncratic when vehicles twice as old were still on Green Line work.|$|R
50|$|The other Northern Counties-bodied Lowlanders {{were those}} {{supplied}} to the South Notts Bus Company of Gotham, Nottinghamshire, who purchased one {{a year from}} 1963 to 1967. South Notts was since 1929 half-owned by the Dabell family and half by major independent bus & coach operator Barton Transport Ltd; Barton had taken Northern Counties bodies on its double deckers since 1957 and in 1960 South Notts had a Northern Counties lowbridge forward-entrance Titan PD3, similar to Barton's contemporary AEC Regents but without the full front and ‘wrap around’ <b>curved</b> <b>windscreens</b> and upper deck windows. Like this and contemporary Barton double deckers, the South Notts Lowlanders had a sliding, air-operated, single-piece entry door; the SBG’s Lowlanders all had folding four-leaf doors to the entrance.|$|R
50|$|In June 1965, the Renault Super Goélette SG2 {{replaced}} the Goélette with new features: wide <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen,</b> {{replacement of the}} sheet metal dashboard, steering wheel shifter, front independent, variable flexibility suspension with coil springs (rear leaf spring suspension in 1967), telescopic shock absorbers and high ground clearance. However, the gasoline engine was a Étendard type.|$|E
50|$|The GT was {{designed}} for the Ford Popular and {{was based on the}} Rochdale F type racing body, but a roof was added to increase the chassis's torsional stiffness (flex) compared to the open ST. The GT was well equipped and came ready-fitted with doors, bonnet, and <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen.</b> From 1960 the car was available with Rochdale's own chassis. About 1350 were made.|$|E
50|$|The Vega Gull {{retained}} the de Havilland Gipsy Six air-cooled inline engine {{introduced in the}} D.3 Gull Six of 1934. Most examples were fitted with the optional DH Gipsy Six Series II engine {{in conjunction with the}} DH-PD30 VP airscrew. The final Mk II examples were fitted with a <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen</b> (the earlier examples had a multi-faceted windscreen of flat panels) similar in appearance to the early marks of the Proctor.|$|E
50|$|Independent {{customers}} for the RU were headed by Lancashire United Transport (LUT) of Atherton who took delivery of fifty over 1970-1. These {{had a special}} version of the Plaxton Derwent II body supplied only to this operator featuring flat rather than <b>curved</b> <b>windscreens,</b> deleting peaks on front and rear domes and having glazing and general appearance similar to Plaxton's previous (1958-66) Highway bus body. They also appear (judging by photographic evidence) to have had front-mounted radiators. As well as being fitted to the fifty RU which were dual-door 40-seaters on short chassis, the same body went on two batches of Bristol RESL6G, twenty B42D in 1967/8 and ten DP41F in 1973/4. Subsequently LUT (and other outliers such as the Calderdale Region of West Yorkshire PTE) were prevailed upon to take the standard version of the Derwent II.|$|R
50|$|The Dartline was {{unveiled}} by Duple at the 1988 British Motor Show, {{along with the}} Dennis Dart chassis. The first body to be built on the Dart, it was 2.3m wide, and initially offered in just one length, 9m. Its most distinctive feature was its <b>curved,</b> asymmetric <b>windscreen</b> covering the destination sign with an arched top.|$|R
50|$|In October 2007 Optare {{unveiled}} the Solo SR at the Coach & Bus Show. It is a completely-restyled {{version of the}} Solo drawing styling features from the Versa, such as the curved side windows and sweeping roof (with the destination screen and air conditioning unit underneath). Some features of the Solo such as the <b>curved</b> front <b>windscreen</b> and the unusual chassis layout, with the front wheels ahead of the doorway, were retained. Another new unusual feature to the Solo SR {{is the lack of}} a destination box on the standard model. However, Optare do offer this as an option to individual customer specification.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{distinct}} {{designs of}} front end were fitted. The first had two-piece flat windscreens which {{met at a}} slight point in the centre, EL2000-style headlights with separate indicators above, and a shallow, plain bumper. The second (and more common) had a two-piece [...] "barrel" [...] <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen</b> with level top, a slatted grille matching {{the height of the}} headlights, indicators in the headlight surrounds, and a noticeably chunkier bumper. Both windscreen styles had quarterlights.|$|E
50|$|Belron {{was first}} founded {{as a family}} {{business}} in 1897 as Jacobs & Dandor in Cape Town, South Africa. The company was purchased and renamed Plate Glass Bevelling and Silvering in 1899. In 1917, City Glass Bevelling & Silvering Works bought Plate Glass; the companies were merged in 1919 and went ahead to gain success in the windscreen industry by securing the business rights to the <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen</b> production technology in 1953 and introducing laminated rear windows in 1958.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{years later}} Arzens {{came up with}} an {{eye-catching}} and streamlined two seater cabriolet prototype body built around the chassis of an old Buick. The car was christened [...] "La Baleine" [...] (the whale). With its integrated headlights, panoramic <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen</b> (of [...] "plexiglas") and proto-ponton format styling the design anticipated sports cars of the 1950s and 1960s. The car subsequently joined the Bugattis of the Schlumpf Collection at what has become the National Motor Museum in Mulhouse.|$|E
50|$|The <b>curved</b> and raked <b>windscreen</b> and the {{electrically}} powered semi-elliptical rear quarter-lights {{were made from}} Triplex laminated heat-reflecting safety glass, and the {{electrically powered}} side windows were double glazed. The roof was thermally insulated and had a transparent sun panel fixed toward the front, with a blind underneath the panel to block the light when desired.|$|R
50|$|The D.445 {{represented}} an {{evolution of the}} FS Class D.443 engine, maintaining the predecessor's reliability and operational capabilities. At {{the beginning of the}} 1970s FS, during a plan aimed at the expansion and modernization of current service, designed a new version of an unified diesel engine which could also resolve the issue of supplying power to heat carriages in an efficient way through a high voltage Head end power supply (REC) fed by a secondary generator. Previous diesel locomotives were not provided with this and so required the use of a generator wagon (Carro Riscaldo), leading to increased weight. The first series of locomotives, introduced from 1974, were built with <b>curved</b> front <b>windscreens</b> which would be later replaced by cheaper and sturdier flat ones.|$|R
50|$|The Mk 1 used a 1500 cc MGA or Riley 1.5 litre {{engine in}} a ladder chassis with Elva {{designed}} independent front suspension. The engine was set well {{back in the}} chassis to help weight distribution, which produced good handling but encroached on the cockpit making the car a little cramped. The chassis carried lightweight 2-seater open glassfibre bodywork. It was produced as a complete car for the US and European market and available in kit form for the UK market. After about 50 cars were made it was upgraded to the Mk II which was the same car but fitted with a proprietary <b>curved</b> glass <b>windscreen,</b> replacing the original flat-glass split type, and the larger 1600 cc MGA engine. Approximately 400 of the Mk I and II were made.|$|R
50|$|Design {{features}} included aerodynamic styling {{with the}} headlights faired into the wings and, for the time, a steeply sloped, <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen.</b> The body was of pressed steel, incorporating a box-section chassis, and {{was made for}} Jowett by Briggs Motor Bodies in their Doncaster factory. The suspension used torsion-bars on all wheels (independent at the front) and internal gear-and-pinion steering. PA and PB models had mixed Girling hydraulic brakes at the front and mechanical braking at the rear. Later versions were fully hydraulic.|$|E
50|$|The Y10's most {{important}} design innovation was the vertical tail cut-off, {{characterized by the}} tailgate painted in black satin, regardless of the color chosen for the body. The notable wedge shape of the small body is very aerodynamic (CX 0.31) thanks to the hood, which is inclined towards the <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen,</b> and side windows that were mounted flush with the bodywork, {{as well as the}} absence of drip rails, the recessed door handles and roof tapering slightly toward the back.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{truck had}} a split, flat pane windshield {{which is still}} available for certain versions, although since December 1994 the T600's cab using a <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen</b> {{was added to the}} lineup. Originally it was only for the long Aerocab and also as an option on the daycab, and it only became available for the W900S in 2006. The flat windscreen is not available on the Aerocab or the extended daycab versions. Strangely, Kenworth offers the curved window either as a one-piece or as a two-piece with a divider in the middle. In March 1998 the very comfortable Studio Aerocab model was introduced.|$|E
50|$|When the new {{network was}} first built in 1994, new rolling stock was designed. The city wanted fully low-floor trams {{with a novel}} design. A {{partnership}} called Eurotram was formed between CTS and Socimi, an Italian company. Stringent standards were set on ergonomics and aesthetics: the city insisted on a fully low-floor design, with wide doors and electric wheelchair ramps {{in order to facilitate}} access and cater for the elderly and the disabled. Air conditioning was installed, despite advice from the manufacturers that it was unnecessary. The <b>curved</b> front <b>windscreen</b> covers the entire front of the tram, giving it a futuristic appearance. Similarly, large windows were included {{on the sides of the}} tram, with the aim of giving passengers the impression of travelling on a ‘moving pavement’. Eurotram also had a modular construction, with the head units being connected to passenger units, linked to each other by power units resting on their own axles. Another notable feature is that there is no separation between passenger cars; the inside of the tram is one continuous space.|$|R
5000|$|The Spitfire and Bf 109E were well-matched {{in speed}} and agility, {{and both were}} {{somewhat}} faster than the Hurricane. The slightly larger Hurricane was regarded as an easier aircraft to fly and was effective against Luftwaffe bombers. [...] The Royal Air Force's preferred tactic was to deploy the Hurricanes against formations of bombers {{and to use the}} Spitfires against the fighter escorts. The view from the [...] "blown" [...] clear cockpit hood of the Spitfire was considered fair, while upwards good; view to the rear was considered fair for a covered cockpit. The <b>curved</b> plexiglass <b>windscreen</b> however was very bad optically and caused considerable distortion, which made long-distance visual scanning difficult. Spitfire pilot Jeffrey Quill made recommendations for the installation of [...] "optically true" [...] glass into the side panels to solve the problem. [...] The Hurricane had a higher seating position, which gave the pilot a better view over the nose than the Spitfire. The upper canopy panels of the Bf 109 through its E-3 subtype were curved, while the E-4 and later Emil subtypes were modified for better visibility with flat panels and the new design was often retrofitted to earlier 109s.|$|R
2500|$|F4U-4: The last variant to see action during World War II, {{deliveries}} to the U.S. Navy of the F4U-4 began late in 1944, {{and this}} version fully equipped naval squadrons {{four months before}} the end of hostilities. It had the [...] dual-stage-supercharged -18W engine. When the cylinders were injected with the water/alcohol mixture, power was boosted to [...] The aircraft required an air scoop under the nose and the unarmored wing fuel tanks of 62gal (234l) capacities were removed for better maneuverability at the expense of maximum range. The propeller was changed to a four blade type. Maximum speed was increased to [...] and climb rate to over 4,500ft/min (1,180m/min) as opposed to the 2,900ft/min (884m/min) of the F4U-1A. The [...] "4-Hog" [...] retained the original armament and had all the external load (i.e., drop tanks, bombs) capabilities of the F4U-1D. The windscreen was now flat bullet-resistant glass to avoid optical distortion, a change from the <b>curved</b> Plexiglas <b>windscreens</b> with the internal plate glass of the earlier Corsairs. Vought also tested the two F4U-4Xs (BuNos 49763 and 50301, prototypes for the new R2800) with fixed wing-tip tanks (the Navy showed no interest) and an Aeroproducts six-blade contraprop (not accepted for production).|$|R
5000|$|The {{front-end}} styling of the Ace and Aceca reportedly traces back to {{a design}} done by Pinin Farina for AC in the late 1940s. The car is rather light owing to a tubular frame, aluminium engine block and aluminium body panels. Large 16" [...] spoked road wheels and near 50/50 weight distribution allowed exceptional handling on substandard road surfaces. Later Acecas feature front-wheel disc brakes (added in 1957), while all share transverse leaf spring IRS, articulated rear half-axles, worm-gear steering, an optional overdrive on 2nd, 3rd and 4th gears, <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen,</b> and leather-covered bucket seats. The suspension is independent at {{the front and rear}} using transverse leaf springs.|$|E
5000|$|The space {{behind the}} seats had two red {{crocodile}} leather suitcases strapped down with matching straps {{attached to the}} floor. A shallow vanity drawer under the dashboard contained silver accessories, including a hinge-over mirror, a powder compact, a cigarette case, a lighter, and a clothes brush. The car had a radio, a heating and ventilating unit, an internal shutter to block the glass roof panel, detachable rear wheel spats, a washer system for the one-piece <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen,</b> a demister, and a speedometer marked to 120 mph. The headlights and pass lights were faired into the front wings {{in the same manner}} as Blue Clover or the Gold Car.|$|E
5000|$|Dassault {{launched}} the FNX at the 2001 Paris Air Show, {{aiming for a}} 10,500km (5,700nm) range at Mach 0.88 up from the Falcon 900EX 8,300km at Mach 0.84. Its new high-speed wing is 1.86m (6.10ft) wider and with 5° higher wing sweep than the 900 wing, its 20% longer fuselage is keeping the same cabin cross-section but with a new <b>curved</b> <b>windscreen.</b> The trijet have a combined thrust of 18,000lb (80kN) to be provided by Honeywell FX5, a new design, or a Pratt & Whitney Canada PW306 growth version.

50|$|The ply-covered {{fuselage}} of the A-9 was oval in cross-section, deep {{ahead of}} the wings and almost circular to the rear, giving it a pod-and-boom appearance. The fixed tail surfaces were also ply-covered, the fin narrow but with a small fuselage fillet. The control surfaces were fabric covered. In plan the horizontal tail was tapered with sweep on both edges; the broad, curved and balanced rudder reached to the keel and was hinged well aft, almost {{in line with the}} elevator trailing edge, for clearance and moment. The upper fuselage line was almost flat, even over the rear part of the long, two piece canopy, though its <b>windscreen</b> <b>curved</b> down sharply into the nose. There was no skid or wheeled undercarriage; instead the A-9 was launched from a wheeled, drop-off dolly and landed on the locally internally strengthened fuselage underside, aided by a tail bumper.|$|R
2500|$|Production F4U-1s {{featured}} {{several major}} modifications {{compared with the}} XF4U-1. A change of armament to six wing-mounted [...]50in (12.7mm) M2 Browning machine guns (three in each outer wing panel) and their ammunition (400 rounds for the inner pair, 375 rounds for the outer) meant that {{the location of the}} wing fuel tanks had to be changed. In order to keep the fuel tank close to the center of gravity, the only available position was in the forward fuselage, ahead of the cockpit. Accordingly, as a 237gal (897l) self-sealing fuel tank replaced the fuselage mounted armament, the cockpit had to be moved back by [...] and the fuselage lengthened. In addition, 150lb of armor plate was installed, along with a [...] bullet-proof windscreen which was set internally, behind the <b>curved</b> Plexiglas <b>windscreen.</b> The canopy could be jettisoned in an emergency, and half-elliptical planform transparent panels, much like those of certain models of the Curtiss P-40, were inset into the sides of the fuselage's turtledeck structure behind the pilot's headrest, providing the pilot with a limited rear view over his shoulders. A rectangular Plexiglas panel was inset into the lower center section to allow the pilot to see directly beneath the aircraft and assist with deck landings. The engine used was the more powerful R-2800-8 (B series) Double Wasp which produced 2,000hp (1,491kW). On the wings the flaps were changed to a NACA slotted type and the ailerons were increased in span to increase the roll rate, with a consequent reduction in flap span. IFF transponder equipment was fitted in the rear fuselage. These changes increased the Corsair's weight by several hundred pounds.|$|R
