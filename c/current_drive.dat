For HID lamps, there is no improvement of the lamp efficacy in using higher frequency, but for these lamps the ballast losses are lower at higher frequencies and also the light depreciation is lower, meaning the lamp produces more light over its entire lifespan. Some HID lamp types like the ceramic discharge metal halide lamp have reduced reliability when operated at high frequencies {{in the range of}} for these lamps a square wave low frequency <b>current</b> <b>drive</b> is mostly used with frequency in the range of , with the same advantage of lower light depreciation.|$|E

Hitchens cites {{the abolition of}} grammar schools {{as one of the}} main causes, which has also resulted in a decline in social mobility. Hitchens claims egalitarians deny these consequences and that comprehensive education has failed. Hitchens also quotes a 2000 study, which asserted that [...] "the general lowering of standards and rigour since the end of selection {{is one of the main}} reasons behind the <b>current</b> <b>drive</b> to devalue examinations". Hitchens asks why, [...] "the educated, conscious servants of the state should seek to pretend that educational standards are rising when the opposite is true. The answer is that they have put equality before education". Chapter 12, [...] "'The age of the train'", outlines how the Conservative and Labour parties facilitated the dismantling of much of Britain's rail network. Hitchens asserts this is evidence that the [...] "Tory Party does not love Britain, any more than the Labour Party loves the poor". The chapter also provides a conservative argument against mass car ownership, saying that [...] "roads destroy and distort established ways of living", while [...] "the traditional English town, with its defined centre, ancient street pattern and comfortable shape, was not destroyed by the coming of the railway. It was enhanced". In Chapter 13, [...] "A Comfortable Hotel on the Road to Damascus", Hitchens explores how since the 2001 September 11 attacks and the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, certain commentators on the left realigned with an American neoconservative position, which, [...] "delivers him [...] to another portion of the 'centre ground', one where foreign policy is the only thing worth discussing, and where former conservatives and former Leftists can mingle in happy communion", and allows [...] "political conservatism to soothe its tribal base by appearing strong overseas, while failing to be anything of the kind at home".|$|E

Nay your pilot will have to succeed, if he do succeed, very much in spite of said bellowing; he will hear all that, and regard very little of it,--in a patient mild-spoken wise manner, will regard all of it as what it is. And I never doubt but there is in Parliament itself, in spite of its vague palaverings which fill us with despair in these times, a dumb instinct of inarticulate sense and stubborn practical English insight and veracity, that would manfully support a Statesman who could take command with really manful notions of Reform, and as one deserving to be obeyed.

A model of saturable current transformer is proposed.

This synchronous rectifier is completely self-contained. It needs no external signal or power supply. It is also insensitive to parasitic inductance.

By investigating the joint dynamics of streaming instability(i. e., <b>current</b> <b>driven</b> ion acoustic in this paper) and <b>current</b> gradient <b>driven</b> whistler wave {color{blue} {prior to the onset of fast reconnection}}, we show that the nonlinear evolution of current sheet(CS) can be described by a Landau-Ginzburg equation.

For <b>current</b> <b>driven</b> ion acoustic, $Delta_c$ is $leq 10 d_e$.
