2500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1990s the first generating unit in the new Rutenberg Power Station at Zikim, near Ashkelon, went into operation, fired by coal imported through the Port of Ashdod. The port has the necessary facilities for moving the incoming coal from the coal pier to the <b>coal</b> <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> {{in the rear of the}} port, east of the Ashdod power station. There it was loaded on railcars for transport to the power station at Zikim. In 1988 the building of pier 9 was completed, which made possible the unloading of 2.5 million tons coal per year. In August 1989, the building of a conveyor, which transports coal from pier 9 to the coal yard, was completed, and with it the Port of Ashdod's preparation for the [...] "coal age" [...] was concluded on schedule.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to design an {{electric}} control system of stage loader which has clear logical relations and is easy to operate. The control system improves the working reliability of electric control system. Taking stage loader used in <b>coal</b> <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> as an example, we introduce the mechanical structure and working principle of stage loader, mainly discussing about the components of electric control system, the action sequence of the actuator and electrical control PLC program. This paper pointes out that the use of step ladder instruction can make logical relations of action sequence clear and the use of state initialization instruction can make the state transitions among manual program, homing procedure and automatic continuous working procedure simple...|$|E

2500|$|To {{enable the}} {{necessary}} routing, the City of Norfolk's civic leaders provided a [...] long right-of-way around their city through rural Norfolk County. Page-Rogers' interests purchased 1000 feet (300 m) of the waterfront and [...] of adjoining land. There would {{be plenty of}} space for the new <b>coal</b> pier, <b>storage</b> <b>yards,</b> tracks, and support facilities at Sewell's Point. And, best of all, the land and route were each secured without alerting the big railroads.|$|R
40|$|The {{spontaneous}} ignition of coal stockpiles {{is a serious}} economic and safety problem. This paper deals with oxidation and spontaneous combustion of coal piles laid in <b>coal</b> <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> and the measures to avoid the heat losses produced. Investigations on self heating were carried out with five test piles (2000 - 3000 tons) built at the ENDESA power station in Teruel (Spain), {{and the results are}} here reported. The efficiency of several measures to reduce the heat losses were tested: periodic compaction, the use of a low angle slope, protection of the coal stockpiled with an artificial barrier and covering it with an ash-water slurry made with fly ash from the same power station. Wind tunnel tests were used to design the wind barrier which was showed to be very effective although the results indicated {{that the best way to}} avoid the heat losses is the use of an ash-water slurry to cover the coal pile. A direct method to determine the coefficient of total losses was developed and the coefficients of heat losses and total losses were determined. The agreement between the temperatures measured by infrared thermography and thermocouples leads to the conclusion that this technique is also a very effective method to quantify heat emissions from coal piles...|$|E
25|$|Nearly 10 {{years would}} elapse before the idea, given impetus by World War I, {{would become a}} reality. The new Naval Base was aided by the {{improvements}} remaining from the Exposition, the strategic location at Sewell's Point on Hampton Roads, and {{the large amount of}} vacant land in the area. The <b>coal</b> piers and <b>storage</b> <b>yards</b> of the Virginian Railway (VGN), built by William N. Page and Henry H. Rogers, and completed in 1909, was immediately adjacent to the Exposition site. The well-engineered VGN was a valuable link directly to the bituminous coal of southern West Virginia, which the Navy strongly preferred for its steam-powered ships.|$|R

40|$|Inbound and {{outbound}} containers are temporarily {{stored in}} the <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> at container terminals. A combination of container demand increase and <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> capacity scarcity create complex operational challenges for <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> managers. This paper presents an in-depth overview of <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> operations, including the material handling equipment used, and highlights current industry trends and developments. A classification scheme for <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> operations is proposed and used to classify scientific journal papers published between 2004 and 2012. The paper also discusses and challenges the current operational paradigms on <b>storage</b> <b>yard</b> operations. Lastly, the paper identifies new avenues for academic research based on current trends and developments in the container terminal industry. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Container <b>storage</b> <b>yards</b> include yards for inbound containers with cargo and internal movements, yards for outbound containers with cargo, yards for trans-shipment containers and yards for empties. The area requirements are measured in TEU ground slots (the area required for one 20-ft container) plus operating space for equipment that transfers containers to and from the yards and that stack and deliver containers.|$|R
