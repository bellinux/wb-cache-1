40|$|Scour at <b>culvert</b> <b>outlets</b> is a {{phenomenon}} encountered world-wide. Research into the problem has mainly been of an experimental nature, with equations being derived for particular circumstances. These traditional scour prediction equations, although offering the engineer some guidance on the likely magnitude of maximum scour depth, are applicable only to a limited range of situations. A model for the prediction of scouring that is generally applicable to all circumstances is not currently available. However, {{there is a substantial}} amount of data available from research over many years in this area. This paper compares current prediction equations with results obtained from two Artificial Neural Network models (ANN). The development of a basic feed forward artificial neural network trained by back-propagation to model scour downstream of <b>culvert</b> <b>outlets</b> is described. A supervised training algorithm is used with data collected from published studies and the authors’ own experimental work.

40|$|Abstract. Alteration {{of urban}} streams by {{culverts}} is common {{throughout the world}} and is known to impede freshwater fishmovement. Themain objectives were therefore to investigate how different culvert characteristics (e. g. height, length, angle, perched v. non-perched) and habitat variables (e. g. water velocity, riverbed gradient) affect the passage success of juvenile inanga (Galaxias maculatus), a weak-swimming migratory fish. We determined whether passage of juvenile G. maculatus could be improved by installing a ramp at thirteen replicate in situ culverts in Nelson City, New Zealand. As expected, none of the 400 fish tested were able to pass undercut (i. e. perched) culverts before ramp installation (0 % passage), compared with the 250 fish (65 % passage) that were able to pass non-perched culverts. Significantly more fish (44 % passage) reached perched <b>culvert</b> <b>outlets</b> when aided by the ramp. Passage success with the ramp depended on its length and angle, with fewer fish passing longer or steeper ramps. To provide upstream passage for weak-swimming species such as juvenile (fork lengtho 60 mm) G. maculatus, ramp length and angle should not exceed three metres and 20 degrees, respectively. With passage requirements known and mitigation processes in place, urban fish populations {{might be able to}} be sustained...|$|R

40|$|Fish {{passage through}} {{culverts}} {{is an important}} consideration in fish bearing streams. Just as adequate culvert capacity is required for safety, adequate provision for fish passage is required to maintain healthy fish populations. The main problem with improperly designed and installed culverts is that they form velocity barriers to fish migrants at the outlet, inlet or through the culvert barrel. If water depths are too low or water velocities at any of these three culvert locations exceed fish swimming ability, fish may be prevented from reaching their spawning grounds. Since hydraulic efficiency and optimum fish passage requirements are mutually exclusive objectives, compromises must be effected that permit adequate fish protection with maximum economy. Such compromises involve the matching of water velocities with fish swimming performance at design discharges that allow limited delay in fish migrations. Migrating fish must negotiate the <b>culvert</b> <b>outlet,</b> the culvert barrel, and the culvert inlet before successfully passing upstream. Hydraulic conditions, such as water velocities and depths, at {{each one of these}} three locations must be suitable for passage at the highest and lowest stream flows expected during fish migration. Fish need to swim continuously for the entire culvert length when no resting opportunities are available. Culvert length and velocities, as well as maximum distance that fish are able to swim, determine whether fish can pass through a culvert once they enter it...|$|E

Also, this paper presents the results of a Laser Doppler Velocimetry study of hydraulic jumps in a culvert with different relative tailwater depths and different initial Froude numbers. The characteristics of hydraulic jumps were discussed and analyzed. Non– dimensional design curves were provided to relate the jump characteristics. The maximum vertical velocity in the recirculating zone for all jumps is about 6 % of the initial velocity. The results show that the maximum streamwise velocity near the center plane was smaller than that near the side wall.

The first set of data {{is a series of}} twelve experiments of 1000 minutes duration, where the scour in one cohesive material downstream of a <b>culvert</b> <b>outlet</b> was observed, with the tailwater maintained at a certain height above the culvert invert. The other set of data is an unpublished laboratory study of the scour of clays by a submerged circular wall jet produced in two {{cohesive soils}} by flow through a nozzle with a diameter of 4. 9, 5. 97 or 12. 18 mm. Twenty-three experiments were performed to examine the shape and size of the scour holes produced in these materials in the asymptotic state. In the present study, dimensionless scour hole profiles are developed to give the general shape of the scour holes produced by these jets in cohesive material. It is seen the scour holes have the same dimensionless shape, and this shape is consistent through the scouring process. Using dimensional analysis, a model has been developed to predict the characteristic dimensions of the scour hole, such as the maximum scour depth, the length of the scour hole, and the maximum width. These dimensions are found to correlate well with a dimensionless excess shear stress term found from dimensional analysis. Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

In addition, the volume of sediment deposited in Canyon Creek Meadows Reservoir was estimated and {{an evaluation of the}} erosion potential of the accumulated sediments was performed. The existing operation of the dam is to maintain the outlet gate in a fully opened position. This has an effect on the sediment transport capacity of the channel in the reach upstream of the reservoir. During high flows that exceed the capacity of the <b>outlet</b> <b>culvert,</b> transport of bed material is significantly reduced and sediment is deposited in the channel and overbank areas that are inundated by the reservoir pool. As the reservoir inflow rate drops below the outflow rate of the culvert, the reservoir pool drops and flow is concentrated into the low flow channel within the reservoir. As a result, sediment transport capacity increases. Where the flow is concentrated in the low flow channel, deposited sediments are remobilized and transported to downstream reaches. In the overbank areas affected by the reservoir pool, sediment deposits are not remobilized unless local storm events cause surface erosion by overland flow.

The rainstorm occurred one month after a wildfire that burned about 11 ha of the steep watershed (55 ha), almost entirely mantled by volcaniclastic deposits. The research was based on fieldwork and laboratory analysis addressed {{to the understanding of}} the geomorphic effects of the wildfire and their impact on erosional and depositional processes triggered by subsequent rainstorms. Field evidence indicates that a series of overland flows caused significant runoff and sediment yields along the hillslope and accumulation of hyperconcentrated flow deposits in a concrete channel occluded by a sealed <b>culvert</b> at the <b>outlet</b> of the watershed. The results of geomorphological and sedimentological analysis suggest that the occurrence of volcaniclastic covers mantling the slopes likely favored accelerated soil erosion, especially where vegetation and litter had been removed by the fire. Chemical analysis on sediment samples, revealed the occurrence of iron oxides that enhanced soil water repellency conditions over wide areas of the burned watershed compared to the unburned areas. Quantitative analysis of sediment budgets showed that the rainfall-induced erosion response at Sant'Angelo creek watershed resulted in a soil loss of 19. 8 – 33. 1 tons ha− 1 over burned areas.

We analyzed the composition {{and structure of the}} ichthyofauna and tested for spatial patterns.

We collected 2, 220 fish of 33 species; 901 in stretches of the Lopeí stream - circular culvert and 1, 310 in stretches of the Pindorama stream - box culvert. Fish abundance was similar in upstream and downstream stretches of the circular culvert, whereas it was slightly higher in the upstream than downstream stretch for the box culvert. Characiformes predominated in the upstream stretch of both culverts. On the other hand, Siluriformes was abundant in the downstream stretch of the circular culvert, with similar abundance in the stretches of the box culvert. Species richness and diversity (Shannon-Weiner Index) were higher in the downstream stretch of the circular culvert, but they were similar in both stretches of the box culvert. The most abundant species were Astyanax altiparanae, A. paranae, A. fasciatus, Ancistrus sp., and Hypostomus sp. The last two species were more abundant in the downstream stretch of the circular culvert, and similar in stretches of the box culvert. Our study indicated variations in the species abundance, richness, and diversity between upstream and downstream stretches in particular of the circular culvert in the Lopeí stream, suggesting that fish movements are restrained more intensively in this culvert, especially for Siluriformes.

40|$|In {{the month}} of July 1997, 38 {{culverts}} suspected of blocking upstream passage of juvenile salmonids were inventoried on the Hoonah Ranger District. Attributes measured included species/numbers of fish upstream and downstream of each culvert, in addition to physical characteristics such as outlet barrier height, culvert gradient, and upstream habitat. Thirty culverts exhibited some form of physical impediment (excessive barrier height and/or gradient) to the upstream migration of juvenile salmonids. Of the 30 barrier culverts, {{the height of the}} lower lip of the <b>culvert</b> <b>outlet</b> above the streambed ranged from 0 cm to 205 cm and averaged 36. 5 cm. The gradient of these structures ranged from – 0. 5 percent to 14. 5 percent and averaged 5. 0 percent. Thirteen Class I (anadromous) culverts were sampled, of which nine lacked juvenile coho upstream of the culvert (no juvenile steelhead trout were trapped during the study). Boxplots of number of juvenile salmon trapped upstream of culverts relate a considerable reduction in distribution, median, and mean as compared to downstream. All 13 culverts exhibited an outlet perched above the streambed, with barrier heights ranging from 10 cm to 99 cm, averaging 38. 8 cm. Class I culvert gradient ranged from 0. 5 percent to 9. 5 percent and averaged 3. 4 percent. Nineteen culverts were identified as Class II culverts (i. e., culverts in streams providing cutthroat trout and Dolly Varden charr habitat occupied upstream of anadromous habitat) during the survey, of which 17 exhibited some physical form of barrier to juvenile passage. Outlet barrier heights ranged from 0 cm to 205 cm, averaging 37. 2 cm. Culvert gradient ranged from 2. 0 percent to 9. 0 percent and averaged 4. 3 percent. Eight of the 19 Class II culverts had resident fish species trapped upstream of the culvert, six of which occurred above culverts exhibiting barrier characteristics such as outlet perch or excessive gradient. Boxplot distribution, median, and mean of height of outlet barrier and culvert gradient tended to be greater at Class I and Class II structures without fish trapped upstream as compared to culverts where fish were trapped upstream. This pattern was repeated for culvert length at Class I crossings, but was reversed for Class II structures. Overall, barrier culverts resulted in a loss of 8. 11 km (16, 534 m 2) of fish habitat, comprised of 2. 68 km (6, 408 m 2) of Class I and 5. 42 km (10, 126 m 2) Class II habitat. Habitat lost per culvert at Class I crossings was 206 m (493 m 2 by area), and 319 m (596 m 2 by area) for Class II culverts. Roughly 37 % of Class I fish habitat lost (determined by length) was of high-quality Floodplain process group reaches with an additional 47 percent comprised of moderate-quality Moderate Gradient–Mixed Control reaches. Class II habitat lost comprised about 41 percent Mixed-Moderate reaches, followed by 32 percent High Gradient-Contained and 17 percent Alluvial Fan process group reaches, both providing relatively low-quality fish habitat...|$|E
40|$|Corrugated {{steel pipe}} (CSP) {{culverts}} {{are widely used}} as an economical alternative for conveying streams and small rivers through road embankments. While passage of the design flow is generally the primary goal for culvert design, consideration must also be given to maintaining connectivity within the aquatic environment for fish and other aquatic organisms. In Canada, the design criteria for fish passage through culverts are generally specified {{in terms of a}} maximum mean flow velocity corresponding to the weakest swimming fish expected to be found at a specific location. Studies have shown, however, that the velocity distribution within a CSP culvert may provide sufficient areas of lower velocity flow near the culvert boundary to allow for fish passage, even when the mean flow velocity may exceed a fish’s swimming ability. Improved knowledge of the hydraulic conditions within CSP culverts, combined with research into fish swimming capabilities and preferences, may make it possible to better tailor culvert designs for fish passage {{while at the same time}} decreasing construction costs. To meet the requirements of regulators, various measures may be taken to reduce culvert flow velocities. Embedding, or setting the invert of a culvert below the normal stream bed elevation, is a simple and inexpensive method of increasing the flow area in a culvert flowing partially full, thereby decreasing flow velocity. Fish traversing through an embedded culvert benefit not only in terms of lower mean flow velocities, but also even lower flow velocities in the near boundary region. In the province of Saskatchewan culvert embedment is regularly used as a means to improve fish passage conditions. In this study, a laboratory scale model was used to study the velocity distribution within a non-embedded and embedded CSP culvert. An acoustic Doppler velocimeter was used to measure point velocities throughout the flow cross section at several longitudinal locations along the culvert. The hydraulic conditions were varied by changing the discharge, culvert slope and depth of embedment. The point velocity data were analyzed to determine patterns of velocity and turbulence intensity at each cross section, as well as along the length of the culvert. The results from the embedded culvert tests were compared with the results from the equivalent non-embedded tests, so that initial conclusions could be made regarding the use of embedment to improve conditions for fish passage. Analysis of the cross section velocity distributions showed that, even the non-embedded culvert had a significant portion of the flow area with flow velocity less than the mean velocity. The results from the embedded tests confirmed that embedding the culvert reduced the flow velocity throughout each cross section, although the effect was most significant for the cross sections located greater than one culvert diameter downstream from the inlet. This variation in effectiveness of embedment at reducing flow velocities is attributed to the length of the M 1 backwater profile relative to the culvert length, and thus the differential increase in flow depth that occurred at each measurement location along the culvert. For both the non-embedded and embedded culvert the peak point magnitudes of turbulence intensity were found to be located near the culvert inlet where the flow was contracting. In terms of the cross section average turbulence intensity, in the non-embedded culvert turbulence increased with distance downstream from the inlet and was highest at the cross sections located near the <b>culvert</b> <b>outlet.</b> Embedding the culvert was found to either have no impact, or to slightly increase, the cross section average turbulence intensity near the inlet. Again, a result that is attributed to the tapering out of the M 1 backwater profile at locations near the inlet under the flow conditions tested. However, beyond eight culvert diameters downstream from the inlet, embedment did result in lower cross section average turbulence intensity when compared to the non-embedded culvert. The measured velocity profiles for the non-embedded tests were found to compare well to the theoretical log-law velocity distribution using a ks value of between 0. 012 m and 0. 022 m, or approximately one to two times the corrugation amplitude, when the datum for analysis was considered to be located at the crest of the pipe corrugation. The cross section velocity distributions for the non-embedded tests compared very well to the model proposed by Ead et al. (2000). Based on this assessment, it appears that the Ead et al. model is potentially suitable for use in predicting the amount of the cross sectional area in a non-embedded culvert with flow velocity less than the design target for culvert fish passage design purposes. Overall, the results of the study confirm that, embedding a CSP culvert may be an effective way to improve fish passage conditions in terms of both flow velocity and turbulence intensity...|$|E

When the turbulence of the main flow not exist, the derived velocity low agree with Nikuradse's experimental results. If we have knowledge of the character about the main flow, it is possible to evaluate the growth of boundary-layer under the influence of turbulent main flow.

They provide habitat {{to some of the}} North America’s most abundant and rich biodiversity, while also serving as water sources for human drinking, agricultural, and recreational needs. The Nature Conservancy (TNC) has identified several priority watersheds through its Ozarks Ecoregional Conservation Assessment of 2003, where it focuses its on-the ground conservation planning and implementation efforts. Sedimentation from unpaved roads is a primary threat to water quality in Ozark streams. TNC has partnered with various organizations including the US Forest Service (USFS), the Watershed Conservation Resource Center (WCRC), and others to develop a multi-phased approach to address the impacts of unpaved roads on these priority watersheds. The first step in the approach utilizes advanced GIS/GPS technologies to develop a detailed vehicle-based road inventory of the target watershed or subwatershed. Sub-meter differential GPS with customized data dictionaries are used to characterize the location and function of sediment-producing and conveying features of the road infrastructure, including the road surface, prism and slope, ditches, bars, lead-offs, <b>culverts,</b> crossings, and <b>outlets.</b> The road inventory yields a comprehensive geodatabase and map series of the mapped features. A stratified random sample of the inventoried road network is then measured to generate sediment yield predictions on ten percent of the road network. Detailed field measurements are collected with differential GPS and customized data dictionaries. The data are entered into the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model, a process-based erosion prediction model developed by multiple federal agencies over the past 20 years. With sediment yields predicted for sample sites, erosion predictions are then extrapolated for the entire study watershed using the road inventory geodatabase. Once sedimentation yields are predicted for each road segment in the entire study area, priority sub-watersheds are identified in the GIS using watershed sediment accumulation tools. These sub-watersheds with high potential for sediment yield may be compared to species inventory data, stream bank erosion surveys, and other land use information to set priorities for conservation planning and prioritization efforts. Priority infrastructure maintenance improvements are also identified through features that were flagged in the road inventory geodatabase as needing repair or replacement. Road maintenance workshops are held with USFS engineers, county road crews, and other partners to transfer the inventory information, present the findings of the study and to demonstrate best management practices for road maintenance. Since 2004, TNC and its partners in the Arkansas have worked in three priority Ozark watersheds to inventory over 600 miles of unpaved roads and 3000 associated point features in an area greater than 900 square miles.

40|$|As long linear ecosystems, {{rivers and}} streams are {{particularly}} vulnerable to fragmentation. There is growing concern {{about the role of}} road crossings – and especially culverts – in altering habitats and disrupting river and stream continuity. The River and Stream Continuity Project began in the year 2000 with a startup grant from the Massachusetts Watershed Initiative. The University of Massachusetts took the lead in convening a group of people from a variety of agencies and organizations who were concerned about the impact of road-stream crossings on fish and other aquatic organism passage. In 2005, three of the organizations/agencies that were key players in initiating and implementing the project joined to create the River and Stream Continuity Partnership. Founding members of the Partnership include: • UMass Extension (University of Massachusetts Amherst) • Massachusetts Riverways Program (MA Department of Fish and Game) and • The Nature Conservancy Members of the Partnership have made a commitment to the ongoing implementation of the River and Stream Continuity Project, including updates and revisions to the MA River and Stream Crossing Standards, coordination and implementation of volunteer assessments, management of the Continuity database, and projects to upgrade or replace substandard crossing structures. Since its beginning, the River and Stream Continuity Project has: • Developed “Massachusetts River and Stream Crossing Standards” to facilitate river and stream continuity as well as fish and wildlife passage. These standards are referenced in federal and state regulations and policies affecting road-stream crossings. • Created a field protocol for volunteer assessment of road-stream crossings, including data forms, instructions, and training materials. • Developed a system for scoring crossing structures for their effects on river and stream continuity and aquatic organism passage based on volunteer assessments. • Created an online database for data on road-stream crossings collected by volunteers. All crossings are geo-refer enced and information from the database can be easily used in a GIS to depict the location and score of all as sessed structures in participating states. • Developed a statewide GIS coverage prioritizing all mapped stream segments in Massachusetts into three catego ries based on information about their importance for fish and wildlife. • Conducted volunteer assessments of road-stream crossings in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire. • Initiated demonstration projects to mitigate known barriers to aquatic organism passage on high-priority streams. • Developed workshops, presentations and other educational material on the subject of river and stream continuity and the Massachusetts River and Stream Crossing Standards. Sedimentation from unpaved roads is a primary threat to water quality in Ozark streams. TNC has partnered with various organizations including the US Forest Service (USFS), the Watershed Conservation Resource Center (WCRC), and others to develop a multi-phased approach to address the impacts of unpaved roads on these priority watersheds. The first step in the approach utilizes advanced GIS/GPS technologies to develop a detailed vehicle-based road inventory of the target watershed or subwatershed. Sub-meter differential GPS with customized data dictionaries are used to characterize the location and function of sediment-producing and conveying features of the road infrastructure, including the road surface, prism and slope, ditches, bars, lead-offs, <b>culverts,</b> crossings, and <b>outlets.</b> The road inventory yields a comprehensive geodatabase and map series of the mapped features. A stratified random sample of the inventoried road network is then measured to generate sediment yield predictions on ten percent of the road network. Detailed field measurements are collected with differential GPS and customized data dictionaries. The data are entered into the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model, a process-based erosion prediction model developed by multiple federal agencies over the past 20 years. With sediment yields predicted for sample sites, erosion predictions are then extrapolated for the entire study watershed using the road inventory geodatabase. Once sedimentation yields are predicted for each road segment in the entire study area, priority sub-watersheds are identified in the GIS using watershed sediment accumulation tools.
