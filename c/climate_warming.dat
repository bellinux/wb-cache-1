Research on China indicates that urban heat island effect contributes to <b>climate</b> <b>warming</b> by about 30%. On the other hand, one 1999 comparison between {{urban and rural}} areas proposed that the urban heat island effects have little influence on global mean temperature trends.

The study constructed a mathematical model to predict how the loss of sea ice from <b>climate</b> <b>warming</b> would affect a big colony of emperor penguins at Terre Adélie, Antarctica.

5|$|Grey jays are {{classified}} as least concern (LC) according to the IUCN Red List, having stable populations over a very large area of boreal and subalpine habitats only lightly occupied by humans. Significant human impacts may nevertheless occur through anthropogenic <b>climate</b> <b>warming.</b> Grey jays at the northern edges of their range may benefit from the extension of spruce stands out onto formerly treeless tundra. A study of a declining population {{at the southern end}} of the grey jay's range linked the decline in reproductive success to warmer temperatures in preceding autumns. Such warm temperatures may trigger spoilage of the perishable food items stored by grey jays upon which success of late winter nesting partly depends.|$|E

5|$|The Mesolithic {{lasted from}} 9000 BCE (rapid <b>climate</b> <b>warming)</b> to 5500 BCE (arrival of first farmers from the Danube River area). It {{was the last}} period when the food {{production}} economy was entirely opportunistic, based on assimilation {{of plant and animal}} material found in nature, that is gathering and hunting. Because of warmer temperatures, complex forest ecosystems and wetlands developed and this natural diversity necessitated new hunting and fishing strategies. As new populations entered Poland from the west, hunters and fishermen working individually or in small groups had to pursue single large and small animals using traps, javelins, bows and arrows, boats and fishing equipment, and utilizing dogs. Women engaged in gathering of such products as roots, herbs, nuts, bird eggs, mollusks, fruit or honey, which possibly was even more important than hunting. Mesolithic human settlements became quite numerous {{and by the end of}} this period the economy of harvesting nature became very highly developed. Tools and devices were made of materials such as stone (flint strip mines have been found at the northern edge of Świętokrzyskie Mountains), bone, wood, horn, or plant material for rope and baskets, and included such fine utensils as fishing hooks and sewing needles. Animal figurines were made of amber. At least during the later Mesolithic, the dead were placed in graves and outfitted with familiar objects of their surroundings. One such well preserved grave of an apparent tool-maker, together with his tools and other items, was found in Janisławice near Skierniewice and dated 5500 BCE.|$|E

25|$|This century, thawing of {{the various}} types of Arctic {{permafrost}} could release large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. It has been estimated that about two-thirds of released carbon escapes to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, originating primarily from ancient ice deposits along the ~7,000 kilometer long coastline of the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) and shallow subsea permafrost.

25|$|There is {{considerable}} confidence that climate models provide credible quantitative estimates of future climate change, particularly at continental scales and above. This confidence {{comes from the}} foundation of the models in accepted physical principles and from their ability to reproduce observed features of current climate and past climate changes. Confidence in model estimates is higher for some climate variables (e.g., temperature) than for others (e.g., precipitation). Over several decades of development, models have consistently provided a robust and unambiguous picture of significant <b>climate</b> <b>warming</b> in response to increasing greenhouse gases.|$|E
25|$|How might {{climate change}} affect energy {{consumption}} in the United States? The research evidence is relatively clear that <b>climate</b> <b>warming</b> will mean reductions in total U.S. heating requirements and increases in total cooling requirements for buildings. These changes will vary by region and by season, but they will affect household and business energy costs and their demands on energy supply institutions. In general, the changes imply increased demands for electricity, which supplies virtually all cooling energy services but only some heating services. Other effects on energy consumption are less clear.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} rapidly {{changing}} physical settings in the subantarctic has been produced on Heard Island {{by a combination of}} rapid glacial recession and <b>climate</b> <b>warming.</b> The consequent increase in habitat available for plant colonisation, plus the coalescing of previously discrete ice-free areas, has led to marked changes in the vegetation of Heard Island in the last 20 years or so. Other species and vegetation communities found on subantarctic islands north of the Antarctic Convergence now absent from the Heard Island flora may colonise the island if climate change produces more favourable conditions.|$|E

500|$|The Stone Age era lasted 800,000 years, and {{involved}} three different human species: Homo erectus, Homo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens. The Stone Age cultures ranged from early human groups with primitive tools to advanced agricultural societies, which used sophisticated stone tools, built fortified settlements and developed copper metallurgy. As elsewhere in {{eastern and central}} Europe, the Stone Age human cultures went through the stages known as the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic, each bringing new refinements of the stone tool making techniques. The Paleolithic period human activities (the earliest sites are about 500,000 years old) were intermittent because of the recurring periods of glaciation. With the recession of the last glaciation, a general <b>climate</b> <b>warming</b> and the resulting increase in ecologic environment diversity was characteristic of the Mesolithic (from 9000-8000 BCE). The Neolithic brought the first settled agricultural communities; their founders migrated from the Danube [...] River area (from 5500 BCE). Later the native post-Mesolithic populations also adopted and further developed the agricultural way of life (from 4400 to about 2000 BCE).|$|E
500|$|The rapid thinning, {{acceleration}} and retreat of Helheim, Jakobshavns and Kangerdlugssuaq glaciers in Greenland, all in close association with one another, suggests a common triggering mechanism, such as enhanced surface melting due to regional <b>climate</b> <b>warming</b> or {{a change in}} forces at the glacier front. The enhanced melting leading to lubrication of the glacier base has been observed to cause a small seasonal velocity increase {{and the release of}} meltwater lakes has also led to only small short term accelerations. The significant accelerations noted on the three largest glaciers began at the calving front and propagated inland and are not seasonal in nature. Thus, the primary source of outlet glacier acceleration widely observed on small and large calving glaciers in Greenland is driven by changes in dynamic forces at the glacier front, not enhanced meltwater lubrication. [...] This was termed the Jakobshavns Effect by Terence Hughes at the University of Maine in 1986. Indeed, a study published in 2015 on glacial underwater topography at 3 sites found cavities, due to warm subglacial water intrusion, which has been identified as a possible dominant force for ablation (surface erosion). Thus, suggests ocean temperature controls ice sheet surface runoff at specific sites. These findings also show that models underestimate the sensitivity of Greenland glaciers to ocean warming and resulting ice sheet runoff. Hence, without better modelling, new observations suggest that past projections of sea level rise attribution from the Greenland Ice Sheet require upward revision.|$|E

2500|$|The Larsen {{disintegration}} {{events were}} unusual by past standards. Typically, ice shelves lose mass by iceberg calving and by melting at their {{upper and lower}} surfaces.

According to a paper published in Journal of Climate in 2006, the peninsula at Faraday station warmed by 2.94 degrees C (5.3 degrees F) from 1951 to 2004, much faster than Antarctica {{as a whole and}} faster than the global trend; this localized warming is caused by anthropogenic global warming, through a strengthening of the winds circling the Antarctic.|$|E
2500|$|The Waikato River is {{the longest}} river in New Zealand, running for [...] through the North Island. It rises in the eastern slopes of Mount Ruapehu, joining the Tongariro River system and flowing through Lake Taupo, New Zealand's largest lake. It then drains Taupo at the lake's northeastern edge, creates the Huka Falls, and flows {{northwest}} through the Waikato Plains. It empties into the Tasman Sea south of Auckland, at Port Waikato. It gives {{its name to the}} Waikato Region that surrounds the Waikato Plains. The present course of the river was largely formed about 17,000 years ago. Contributing factors were <b>climate</b> <b>warming,</b> forest being reestablished in the river headwaters and the deepening, rather than widening, of the existing river channel. The channel was gradually eroded as far up river as Piarere, leaving the old Hinuera channel high and dry.

40|$|It {{is unclear}} how the width and {{strength}} of the Hadley circulation are controlled and how they respond to climate changes. Simulations of global warming scenarios with comprehensive climate models suggest the Hadley circulation may widen and weaken as the <b>climate</b> <b>warms.</b> But these changes are not quantitatively consistent among models, and how they come about is not understood. Here, {{a wide range of}} climates is simulated with an idealized moist general circulation model (GCM) coupled to a simple representation of ocean heat transport, in order to place past and possible future changes in the Hadley circulation into a broader context and to investigate the mechanisms responsible for them. By comparison of simulations with and without ocean heat transport, it is shown that it is essential to take low-latitude ocean heat transport and its coupling to wind stress into account to obtain Hadley circulations in a dynamical regime resembling Earth’s, particularly in climates resembling present-day Earth’s and colder. As the optical thickness of an idealized longwave absorber in the simulations is increased and the <b>climate</b> <b>warms,</b> the Hadley circulation strengthens in colder climates and weakens in warmer climates; it has maximum strength in a climate close to present-day Earth’s. In climates resembling present-day Earth’s and colder, the Hadley circulation strength is largely controlled by the divergence of angular momentum fluxes associated with eddies of midlatitude origin; the latter scale with the mean available potential energy in midlatitudes. The importance of these eddy momentum fluxes for the Hadley circulation strength gradually diminishes as the <b>climate</b> <b>warms.</b> The Hadley circulation generally widens as the <b>climate</b> <b>warms,</b> but at a modest rate that depends sensitively on how it is determined. ...|$|R
