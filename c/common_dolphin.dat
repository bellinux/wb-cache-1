40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{new insights}} into the behavioural ecology of free-ranging short-beaked <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Delphinus delphis), in New Zealand. A preliminary assessment of common dolphin-human interactions was also carried out as part of this 3 -yr field study (1998 - 2001). 166 surveys were conducted in the greater Mercury Bay area, on the east coast of Coromandel Peninsula, North Island, New Zealand. These led to 105 focal group follows, with a total of 118. 2 h spent following <b>common</b> <b>dolphins.</b> Seasonal movements of <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> were uncovered, and are apparently tied to fluctuations in sea surface temperature. <b>Common</b> <b>dolphins</b> appear to live in a fission-fusion society. Groups frequently merged and split again. The merging of groups was often accompanied by either sexual, or feeding activity. 408 individual dolphins were identified from photographs of their dorsal fins. No evidence of long-term associations between individuals was found. Resightings of identifiable dolphins indicate movement of individuals between Mercury Bay and the Hauraki Gulf, as well as between Mercury Bay and Whakatane. This study provides the first activity budget for <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> in the wild. <b>Common</b> <b>dolphins</b> spent 55. 6 % of their time traveling, 20. 4 % milling, 16. 2 % feeding, 7. 1 % socialising, and 0. 7 % resting. This proportion did not change significantly by season, or from year to year. <b>Common</b> <b>dolphins</b> were found to feed on at least six different fish species. A number of different feeding strategies were employed to capture these fish. Some of these techniques had previously been observed in bottlenose dolphins and orca, but have never before been described for <b>common</b> <b>dolphins.</b> The {{results of this study suggest}} that <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> can potentially be negatively affected by interactions with humans. Boat traffic appears to disturb some dolphin groups, especially those containing few individuals. However, commercial tourism appeared to have little impact on the dolphins, at this study site. Few attempts at swimming with <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> resulted in a sustained interaction, but unsuccessful attempts did not elicit an obvious negative response. Fishing poses the greatest threat of physical injury and possible mortality to <b>common</b> <b>dolphins.</b> Several key issues were identified, and their value in managing human-dolphin interactions is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Between 1990 and 2007, {{carcasses}} of opportunistically collected short-beaked <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Delphinus delphis; n= 238), Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus; n= 167), and <b>common</b> bottlenose <b>dolphins</b> (Tursiops truncatus; n= 15) {{were examined}} for parasites and life history data. Three species of lung nematodes (Halocercus lagenorhynchi, Stenurus ovatus, Pharurus alatus) {{were identified in}} surface nodules, subsurface lesions, or airways. Nematode burdens were light to heavy and, in many cases, would have compromised the dolphins’ health. The number of dolphins infected was related to species, year, season, age class, and geographic region. Nematodes were found in all three species but were more prevalent in short-beaked <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> (mean annual prevalence= 26 %) than in bottlenose dolphins (12 %). There was {{a significant increase in}} prevalence of nematodes in short-beaked <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> in 2005 – 06 (63 %) compared to 1990 – 2004 (14 %), with a peak in April–June. More young short-beaked <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> were infected than subadults and adults and, during the unusual infection event, there were more dependent calves (< 130 cm) than juveniles. There were also more infections in dependent bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops spp.) calves but no increase in overall prevalence was detected during 2005 – 06. Because neonates of both short-beaked <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> and bottlenose dolphins were infected, mother-to-calf transmission is suspected for these species in South Australia. Numbers of infections in short-beaked <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> were higher in Gulf St Vincent than elsewhere in South Australia, particularly in 2005 – 06. The cause of the unusual infection event in short-beaked <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> is unknown. We discuss the influence of dolphin diet, life history, and external factors.

25|$|Little {{information}} is available on other marine mammals at the Abrolhos, as no direct research on this subject has been undertaken. Sightings of the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), followed by southern rights (Eubalaena australis), are common between April and October, when the whales are migrating. Other marine mammals sometimes sighted at the islands include pygmy Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera edeni), orca (Orcinus orca), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), <b>common</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Delphinus delphis), and striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba).|$|E
25|$|An {{experiment}} on the California drift gill net fishery demonstrated how acoustic pingers reduce marine mammal bycatch. It was shown that bycatch was significantly reduced for common dolphins and sea lions. Bycatch rates were also lower for other cetacean species like the Northern right whale dolphin, Pacific white-sided dolphin, Risso’s dolphin and Dall's Porpoise. It is agreed upon {{that the more}} pingers on a net, the less bycatch. There was a 12-fold decrease in <b>common</b> <b>dolphin</b> entanglement using a net with 40 pingers.|$|E
2500|$|Whales, {{dolphins}} and porpoises all frequent the Irish Sea, but {{knowledge of}} how many there may be and where they go is somewhat sketchy. About a dozen species have been recorded since 1980, but only three are seen fairly often. These are the harbour porpoise, bottlenose dolphin and <b>common</b> <b>dolphin.</b> The more rarely seen species are minke whale, fin whale, sei whale, humpback whale, North Atlantic Right Whales which are now considered to be almost extinct in eastern North Atlantic, sperm whale, northern bottlenose whale, long-finned pilot whale, orca, white-beaked dolphin, striped dolphin and Risso's dolphin.

2500|$|Dolphin group sizes vary quite dramatically. River {{dolphins}} usually congregate {{in fairly}} small groups from 6 to 12 in number or, in some species, singly or in pairs. The individuals in these small groups know and recognize one another. Other {{species such as}} the oceanic Pantropical Spotted Dolphin, <b>Common</b> <b>Dolphin</b> and Spinner Dolphin travel in large groups of hundreds of individuals. It is unknown whether {{every member of the}} group is acquainted with every other. However, {{there is no doubt that}} such large packs can act as a single cohesive unitobservations show that if an unexpected disturbance, such as a shark approach, occurs from the flank or from beneath the group, the group moves in near-unison to avoid the threat. This means that the dolphins must be aware not only of their near neighbors but also of other individuals nearby in a similar manner to which humans perform [...] "Audience waves". This is achieved by sight, and possibly also echolocation. One speculative hypothesis proposed by Jerison (1986) is that members of a pod of dolphins are able to share echolocation results with each other to create a better understanding of their surroundings.|$|E

40|$|New Zealand <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> (Delphinus delphis) {{are subject}} {{to a range of}} human-induced threats {{including}} fisheries bycatch and tourism impacts. <b>Common</b> <b>dolphins</b> are incidentally captured in the trawl fishery for jack mackerel (Trachurus spp) and appear susceptible to entanglement within coastal set nets. Pollutant burdens and tourism impacts reported for New Zealand population appear in line with those previously reported for coastal conspecifics such as the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). Despite this, <b>common</b> <b>dolphins</b> remain the most poorly understood delphinid within New Zealand waters. Until recently, majority of the information relating to their identity, abundance and ecology had relied upon untested assumptions.
