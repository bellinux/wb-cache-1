40|$|International audienceTo {{examine the}} link between <b>chalkbrood</b> and {{treatments}} applied to honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies, growth of Ascosphaera apis was determined under chalkbrood-inducing conditions on agar containing crushed bee larvae as a mock infection. Treatments were tested at concentrations in the field, representative of beekeeping practice (at least in the USA). A chilling or warming stress known to heighten <b>chalkbrood</b> caused no growth enhancement of A. apis.

High-fructose corn syrups and sucrose syrup undiluted, a 50 : 50 mixture, alone, and with antibiotics did not alter growth of A. apis. We conclude that <b>chalkbrood</b> does not develop from a temperature- or treatment-induced activation of A. apis.

40|$|Larvae of {{the honey}} bee (Apis mellifera) can get {{infected}} {{and killed by}} the fungus Ascosphaera apis, which consumes the larva from inside out, then dries, creating a mummy, so-called <b>chalkbrood.</b> A warm or chilling shock to the brood accentuates the disease. Recently, beekeepers have reported increased <b>chalkbrood</b> in their colonies. Examining record books of these colonies indicate treatment with {{high fructose corn syrup}} (HFCS), antibiotics, and miticides. To examine the link that may exist between <b>chalkbrood</b> and treatments applied to colonies, growth rate of A. apis was determined by fungus culture under strong chalkbrood-inducing temperatures on agar supplemented with crushed bee larvae as a mock-infection. Implementing chilling, or warming cues caused no particular growth rate enhancement of A. apis, while miticides had a negative effect on growth, sometimes killing the fungus. HFCS and antibiotics, alone and mixed, did not positively or negatively alter growth of A. apis.

Six bacterial strains were isolated from healthy worker honey bees by culture-dependent methods. Six fungal strains (A 3, A 4, A 7, A 8, A 9, and A 15) of A. apis were isolated from larvae suffering from <b>chalkbrood</b> disease on Yeast-Glucose-Starch agar (YGPSA) medium. All bacteria were identified by a combination of morphology, Gram stain, and 16 S rRNA sequence analysis, and fungal strains were identified by morphology and 5. 8 S rRNA. In vitro and in vivo inhibition assays were carried out to determine the ability of bacterial isolates to inhibit A. apis, the causal agent of <b>chalkbrood</b> disease. The analysis of 16 S rRNA sequences revealed that four bacterial strains (B 2, B 4, B 10, and B 100) belong to Bacillus subtilis species, and two strains (P 1 and P 5) belong to Pseudomonas fluorescence. Significant differences in antagonistic activity of all bacterial strains were observed. B. subtilis isolate B 2 showed the highest antagonistic activity, as measured by the inhibition zone against A. apis, followed by the P 1 strain of P. fluorescence.

40|$|Ascosphaera apis {{is one of}} {{the major}} fungal {{pathogens}} of honey bee broods and the causative agent of <b>Chalkbrood</b> disease. The factors responsible for the pathogenesis of <b>Chalkbrood</b> disease are still not fully understood, and the increasing resistance of A. apis to commonly used antifungal agents necessitates a search for new agents to control this disease. The in vitro antifungal activities of 27 plant essential oils against two isolates of A. apis (Aksu- 4 and Aksu- 9) were evaluated. Out of the 27 plant essential oils tested, 21 were found to be effective in killing both isolates of A. apis. Based on their minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values, the effective oils were grouped into three categories: highly effective, moderately effective and minimally effective. Mountain pepper oil, Kala Bhangra oil, spearmint oil, babuna oil, betel leaf oil, carrot seed oil, cumin seed oil and clove bud oil were highly effective, with MBC values between 50. 0  μg/mL and 600. 0  μg/mL.

40|$|Ascosphaera apis causes <b>chalkbrood</b> in honeybees, {{a chronic}} disease {{that reduces the}} number of viable {{offspring}} in the nest. Although lethal for larvae, the disease normally has relatively low virulence at the colony level.

We exploited a recently modified in vitro rearing technique to infect honeybee larvae from three colonies with naturally mated queens under strictly controlled laboratory conditions, using four strains from two distinct A. apis clades. We found that both strain and colony of larval origin affected mortality rates. The strains from one clade caused 12 - 14 % mortality while those from the other clade induced 71 - 92 % mortality. Larvae from one colony showed significantly higher susceptibility to <b>chalkbrood</b> infection than larvae from the other two colonies, confirming the existence of genetic variation in susceptibility across colonies.

40|$|Abstract Objective: <b>Chalkbrood</b> is a {{fungal disease}} of honey bee brood caused by Ascosphaera apis. This disease is now found {{around the world}} and there are some {{indications}} that the incidence has increased in recent years. The diagnosis of <b>Chalkbrood</b> is based on the recognition of typical clinical symptoms and on the identification of the causative agent. Despite the numerous methods available for the detection of A. apis, the diagnosis of this pathology is not always easy. Methods: Between June and July 2011 an increase in mortality of honey bees was observed to some apiaries of the Caserta province (Campania region, southern Italy). Larvae (no. = 50) from brood samples without signs of disease and adult honey bees (no. = 50) from the same colonies were collected and submitted to our laboratory for routine histologic evaluation. Results and Conclusions: We demonstrate that histopathology is a sensitive and specific method for the detection and identification of Ascosphaera apis infection and has the additional advantage of being able to provide a diagnosis in larvae without signs of disease.

Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine factors that influence the expression of hygienic and non-hygienic behaviour in honey bees, Apis mel/itera, and to examine the correlation between this behaviour and resistance to <b>chalkbrood,</b> Ascosphaera apis. Colonies were headed by instrumentally inseminated queens {{selected on the basis}} of uncapping and removal behaviour expressed by their progeny. In the first experiment, colony strength was altered by transferring hygienic and nonhygienic colonies from 1 O-frame field hives to 2 -frame observation hives. This treatment significantly reduced the hygienic response of the hygienic bees but did not affect the response of the non-hygienic bees. In the second experiment, hygienic and non-hygienic bees displayed different responses to freeze-killed and live brood which had been partially or entirely uncapped. Both lines of bees recapped both partially and entirely uncapped live brood, but non-hygienic bees also recapped partially uncapped freeze-killed brood, suggesting that non-hygienic bees either could not detect dead or diseased brood or avoided it by sealing it within a comb cell. The third experiment tested whether the degree of hygienic behaviour could be increased by adding hygienic bees to non-hygienic colonies. Adding 20 - 30 % young hygienic bees to nonhygienic colonies did not increase the degree of hygienic behaviour, but adding young nonhygienic bees to hygienic colonies suppressed the behaviour. The results suggest that although hygienic behavior is genetically determined, its expression depends on colony strength and composition of workers within the colony. In the fourth experiment, the hygienic and non-hygienic colonies were fed with pollen patties containing A. apis spores. The weak correspondence that was observed between removal behaviour and physiological resistance to <b>chalkbrood</b> suggested that few colonies are both highly hygienic and physiologically resistant to <b>chalkbrood.</b> Selection against uncapping and removing diseased brood might occur if this behaviour also promotes the spread of disease through the colony. This possibility is discussed in relation to avoidance behaviour of other social insects toward pathogens...|$|E
40|$|The {{health of}} pollinators, {{especially}} bees, {{is of the}} utmost importance to success of many agricultural ecosystems. Microorganisms can cause diseases in bees; such microbes are pathogenic. The ability of a pathogen to cause harm to its host (such as a bee) is termed its virulence. Studying the evolution of different levels of virulence can lead researchers {{to a better understanding of}} pathogens, and potentially predict how much harm a pathogen can cause in the future. We studied the evolution of virulence levels for a fungal disease of bees. This group of fungi is composed of 28 species, and some cause a disease in bees called <b>chalkbrood</b> while others do not. Using what we know about virulence evolution we wanted to see if the pathogens could infect all bees, if the pathogens varied in virulence when infecting at the same time as another pathogen, and if solitary bees had any behavioral adaptations that might increase or decrease <b>chalkbrood</b> infection. By using DNA sequences, the relationship between the genetic structures of each of the fungal species was studied, and we found that pathogens of solitary bees grouped together while pathogens of social bees (honey bees) were not part of this group. We then found that a solitary bee pathogen did not infect honey bees very well, and vice versa. The nuances of the relationship between two solitary bee pathogens were examined more closely to determine how the two pathogens interact in this bee. In this case, under varying conditions of infection, one pathogen always maintained a similar level of virulence and spore production, while the other pathogen varied in these measures. In addition, when doses of these fungi were fed to bee larvae at different times, more bees survived than when the doses were given at the same time, suggesting that bee immune responses are very important. Finally, we found no evidence of any specific behaviors of solitary bees exposed to infective spores that would suggest these bees have behaviors that are evolved to alter <b>chalkbrood</b> levels in populations...|$|E

We have identified a number of differentially-regulated transcripts that are implicated in general mechanisms of stress adaptation, including energy metabolism and protein transport. One of the most interesting differentially-regulated transcripts is for a chitinase-like enzyme that may be linked to anti-fungal activities in the honey bee larvae, similarly to gut and fat-body specific chitinases found in mosquitoes and the red flour beetle. Surprisingly, we did not find many components of the well-characterized NF-κB intracellular signaling pathways to be differentially-regulated using the cDNA-AFLP approach.

40|$|Abstract Background We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} transcriptome {{analysis of the}} fungus Ascosphaera apis, an economically important pathogen of the Western honey bee (Apis mellifera) that causes <b>chalkbrood</b> disease. Our goals were to further annotate the A. apis reference genome and to identify genes that are candidates for being differentially expressed during host infection versus axenic culture. Results We compared A. apis transcriptome sequence from mycelia grown on liquid or solid media with that dissected from host-infected tissue. 454 pyrosequencing provided 252 [*]Mb of filtered sequence reads from both culture types that were assembled into 10, 087 contigs. Transcript contigs, protein sequences from multiple fungal species, and ab initio gene predictions were included as evidence sources in the Maker gene prediction pipeline, resulting in 6, 992 consensus gene models. A phylogeny based on 12 of these protein-coding loci further supported the taxonomic placement of Ascosphaera as sister to the core Onygenales. Several common protein domains were less abundant in A. apis compared with related ascomycete genomes, particularly cytochrome p 450 and protein kinase domains. A novel gene family was identified that has expanded in some ascomycete lineages, but not others. We manually annotated genes with homologs in other fungal genomes that have known relevance to fungal virulence and life history. Functional categories of interest included genes involved in mating-type specification, intracellular signal transduction, and stress response. Computational and manual annotations have been made publicly available on the Bee Pests and Pathogens website. Conclusions This comprehensive transcriptome analysis substantially enhances {{our understanding of the}} A. apis genome and its expression during infection of honey bee larvae.
