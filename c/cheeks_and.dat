5|$|B. i. coromandus {{differs from}} the {{nominate}} subspecies in breeding plumage, when the buff colour on its head extends to the <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> throat, and the plumes are more golden in colour. This subspecies' bill and tarsus are longer on average than in B. i. ibis. B. i. seychellarum is smaller and shorter-winged than the other forms. It has white <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> throat, like B. i. ibis, but the nuptial plumes are golden, as with B. i. coromandus. Individuals with abnormally grey, melanistic plumages have been recorded.|$|E

5|$|A {{juvenile}} {{often has}} a dark, brownish-grey nape that may look {{darker than the}} pale-edged black feathers. It has a dark grey to black head, neck, and upperparts, with white throat, <b>cheeks,</b> <b>and</b> underparts. During the first winter, the bill shape of the young {{may not be as}} fully developed as that of the adult, and during the second winter, it much resembles the breeding adult, but with wing coverts lacking white spots.|$|E

5|$|In the {{anthropomorphic}} form, Varaha {{often has}} a stylized boar face, like the zoomorphic models. The snout may be shorter. The position {{and size of}} the tusks may also be altered. The ears, <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> eyes are generally based on human ones. Early sculptors in Udayagiri and Eran faced the issue of how to attach the boar head to the human body and did not show a human neck. However, in Badami, the problem was resolved by including a human neck. While some sculptures show a mane, it is dropped and replaced by a high conical crown - typical of Vishnu iconography - in others. Varaha sculptures generally look up to the right; there are very rare instances of left-facing Varaha depictions.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, muscular, compact {{dog that}} gives the {{impression}} of agility and strength. It has a broad skull that flattens to a definite stop between the eyes, with muscular <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> a medium-length, deep, powerful muzzle. The ears are pricked, small to medium in size and set wide apart, with a covering of hair on the inside. The eyes are oval and dark, with an alert, keen expression. The neck and shoulders are strong and muscular; the forelegs are straight and parallel; and the feet round and arched, with small, sturdy toes and nails.|$|E
5|$|The {{face and}} {{surrounding}} areas, including the lores, supercilium, ear-coverts, <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> throat are a white buff-orange. Below, the belly and breast are a rich cinnamon, darkening to an orange-cinnamon {{at the sides}} of the breast. The rear flanks and undertail-covert feathers are rufous. In worn plumage, the color may be uneven in the lower parts and lighter in hue. The upper mandible of the bill is black, and the lower is gray with a black tip. The iris and legs are dark brown. Juveniles of the species resemble adults but for the base of their beaks being yellow, proportionately shorter, and their overall coloring being less vibrant.|$|E

5|$|The female Bohemian waxwing is {{very similar}} to the male, but has a {{narrower}} yellow terminal band to the tail, a less defined lower edge to the black throat and slightly less distinctive wing markings. Juveniles are duller than adults, with whiter underparts, only a few red wing tips, no black on the throat and a smaller black face mask. Compared to the nominate subspecies, eastern B. g. centralasiae is paler, greyer and has little reddish-brown behind the bill. The American subspecies B. g. pallidiceps has more colouring on the <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> forehead than the nominate form and is otherwise generally duller in appearance.|$|E
5|$|The sexes differ, or are dimorphic, {{in their}} plumage, {{and have a}} similar pattern {{to that in the}} {{corresponding}} sex of house sparrow. There is some variation between the three subspecies, especially in the colouration of the underparts. Birds of the subspecies rutilans are off-white on their <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> the sides of their necks, and have pale grey underparts. Birds of the subspecies intensior have a pale yellow wash on their underparts and cheeks, as well as darker upperparts, while those of the subspecies cinnamomeus have a heavy yellow tinge to their underparts.|$|E

They grew in columns, with an observed maximum of six in each, {{and the number of}} columns varied based on the animal's size. Known column counts for the two species are: 51 to 53columns per maxilla and 48 to 49 per dentary (teeth of the upper jaw being slightly narrower than those in the lower jaw) for E. regalis; and 52columns per maxilla and 44 per dentary for E. annectens (an E. saskatchewanensis specimen).|$|E

5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} (Picathartes oreas) is a {{medium-sized}} {{bird in the}} family Picathartidae with a long neck and tail. Also known as the grey-necked picathartes, this passerine is mainly found in rocky areas of close-canopied rainforest from south-west Nigeria through Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and south-west Gabon. It additionally lives {{on the island of}} Bioko. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often isolated from each other. The rockfowl typically chooses to live near streams and inselbergs in its forested habitat. It has no recognized subspecies, though some believe that it forms a superspecies with the white-necked rockfowl. The grey-necked rockfowl has grey upperparts, a light grey breast, and lemon-coloured underparts. Its unusually long tail is used for balance, and its thighs are muscular. The head is nearly featherless, with the exposed skin being powder blue on the forehead and upper mandible and carmine on the hindcrown. The bird’s <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> eyes are covered in a large, circular black patch that, though narrow, connects and divides the carmine and powder blue skin {{at the peak of the}} crown. Though the bird is usually silent, some calls are known.|$|E
5|$|The adult green rosella has {{a yellow}} head and underparts with blue <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> red band on the {{forehead}} and upper lores. The yellow feathers of the forecrown, lower lores, cheeks, chest and thighs can have red markings, while the yellow feathers of the sides and rear {{of the head and}} neck, and the underparts have dark brown bases. The edges of the feathers on the underparts can be pale brown, resulting in a faint scalloping, which disappears with wear. Some of the yellow feathers of the nape have white bases and when worn, the bird can have a whitish patch on their nape. The yellow {{of the back of the}} head merges indistinctly into the dark plumage of the hindneck, mantle and back, which is black or dark brown with green margins. The feathers of the shoulders are blackish with yellow tips. These margins and tips are often worn by the finish of breeding season, leaving the plumage more solid black. The blue-violet feathers of the chin, throat and cheeks have brown-black bases. The blackish plumage of the back extends to the rump, and the long tail is dark green with brown shafts and dark blue outer feathers and tips. The wings are mostly black and green, with violet-blue marginal coverts, primary coverts, and alula, and blue-tinted dark brown primaries and outer secondaries. Underneath the feathers of the wings are dark brown with blue-violet tips. The iris is brown with a dark grey orbital ring, and the bill is pale-grey, with a dark grey cere. The legs are grey. The yellow plumage of the female is duller and more likely marked with red than that of the male, and the green edges to the black plumage of the upperparts are more prominent.|$|E
25|$|In most South European countries, kissing is {{initiated}} by leaning {{to the left}} side and joining the right <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> if there's a second kiss, changing to the left cheeks. In some cases (e.g. some parts of Italy) the process is the opposite, you first lean to the right, join the left <b>cheeks</b> <b>and</b> then switch to the right cheeks.|$|E
