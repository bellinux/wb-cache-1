5|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{important}} of the Ten Wings is the Great Commentary (Dazhuan) or Xi ci, which dates to roughly 300 BC. The Great Commentary describes the I Ching as a microcosm of the universe and a symbolic description of the processes of change. By partaking in the spiritual experience of the I Ching, the Great Commentary states, the individual <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> deeper patterns of the universe. Among other subjects, it explains how the eight trigrams proceeded from the eternal oneness of the universe through three bifurcations. The other Wings provide different perspectives on essentially the same viewpoint, giving ancient, cosmic authority to the I Ching. For example, the Wenyan provides a moral interpretation that parallels the first two hexagrams, 乾 (qián) and 坤 (kūn), with Heaven and Earth, and the Shuogua attributes to the symbolic function of the hexagrams the ability to understand self, world, and destiny. Throughout the Ten Wings, there are passages that seem to purposefully increase the ambiguity of the base text, pointing to a recognition of multiple layers of symbolism.|$|E
5|$|The Stoics {{sought to}} be free of the unruly emotions, which they {{regarded}} as being contrary to nature. The passions or emotions (pathe) are the disturbing element in right judgment. Chrysippus wrote a whole book concerning the therapy of the emotions. The passions are like diseases which depress and crush the soul, thus he sought to eradicate them (apatheia). Wrong judgements turn into passions when they gather an impetus of their own, just as, when one has started running, it is difficult to stop. One cannot hope to eradicate the emotions when one is in the heat of love or anger: this can only be done when one is calm. Therefore, one should prepare in advance, and deal with the emotions in the mind as if they were present. By applying reason to emotions such as greed, pride, or lust, one <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> harm which they cause.|$|E

However, only Hiligaynon speakers who reside in Kinaray-a-speaking areas <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> language. Those {{who come from}} other areas, like Negros, have difficulty in understanding the language, only if they can at all.|$|E

25|$|Biolinguistics is {{the study}} of the biology and {{evolution}} of language. It is a highly interdisciplinary field, including linguists, biologists, neuroscientists, psychologists, mathematicians, and others. By shifting the focus of investigation in linguistics to a comprehensive scheme that embraces natural sciences, it seeks to yield a framework by which we <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> fundamentals of the faculty of language.|$|E

25|$|Another type {{of virtual}} globe exists whose aim {{is not the}} {{accurate}} representation of the planet but instead a simplified graphical depiction. Most early computerized atlases were of this type and, while displaying less detail, these simplified interfaces are still widespread since they are faster to use because of the reduced graphics content and {{the speed with which}} the user <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> display.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{addition}} of new vocabulary, written Icelandic has not changed substantially since the 11th century, when the first texts were written on vellum. Modern speakers <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> original sagas and Eddas which were written about eight hundred years ago. The sagas are usually read with updated modern spelling and footnotes but otherwise intact (as with modern English readers of Shakespeare). With some effort, many Icelanders can also understand the original manuscripts.|$|E

25|$|In {{the opinion}} of Sasha Sokolov:It seems he was only really {{appreciated}} by professionals. Living here and now, in Tel-Aviv, I remember our few meetings and frequently walk along Ben Yehuda Street, past his house... Sasha is difficult. He's not only difficult stylistically, but also philosophically. He offers up his immense knowledge without thinking of the reader, without glancing back at him – a knowledge of art, science, philology, naturally. I <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> value of his texts, but I don't understand how they were made.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} the wordlist {{analysis}} shows that Itsekiri bears the strongest similarity to the SEY dialects and most especially Ilaje and Ikale, at 80.4% and 82.3% similarity. According to the language assessment criteria of the international Language Assessment Conference (1992), only when a wordlist analysis shows a lexical similarity of below 70% are two speech forms considered to be different languages. An overlap of 70% and above indicates that both speech forms are the same language, although dialect intelligibility tests {{would need to be}} carried out to determine how well speakers of one dialect <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> other speech form.|$|E

It was unfortunate that Frank came out with his criticism, {{but he was the}} center of the storm, having designed the building, and he was just trying to lessen the blame on himself." ...|$|E

The new lines direct the narrative towards [...] "the Lover's ear alone", implying that only other lovers <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> relationship between the moon, the beloved and the beloved's death. Wordsworth also removed from the final stanza the lines: ...|$|E
500|$|Ancient Traders {{design was}} {{influenced}} by that of board games and of the video games Elite and Advance Wars.

He worked with Vcelka to design Ancient Traders appearance, including paper textures and clouds. He revealed that some of the maps' features came from a scan of an old military map of present-day Slovakia. According to Chris Schilling from Eurogamer, Vcelka took inspiration from sixteenth and seventeenth-century cartography, as well as from Abraham Ortelius and his Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, to create [...] "exceptionally detailed art".|$|E

And if we <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> who <b>the</b> attackers are - not to mention their abilities, motivations, and goals - maybe we can install the proper countermeasures to deal with the real threats [1]...|$|R
500|$|Mwng is a [...] "lo-fi", raw, and {{understated}} {{record of}} rock songs, [...] "stripped of the bleeps and squelches" [...] that {{appear on the}} Super Furry Animals' other releases. Although the album's lyrics are in Welsh, singer Rhys has said that [...] "musically there's nothing Welsh about it at all", going on to state that the record's only real Welsh influences are Datblygu (the writers of [...] "Y Teimlad") and Meic Stevens. Instead, the record {{is a tribute to}} the band's obsession with [...] "Anglo-American pop culture of the 60s, 70s and 80s", and is an album that [...] "can be understood on a musical level anywhere in the Westernised world" [...] {{regardless of whether or not}} the listener <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> lyrics.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} {{religion}} {{plays a part}} in her life in 2009, Streep replied: [...] "I follow no doctrine. I don't belong to a church or a temple or a synagogue or an ashram." [...] In an interview in December 2008, she also alluded to her lack of religious belief when she said: [...] "So I've always been really, deeply interested, because I think I <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> solace that's available in the whole construct of religion. But I really don't believe {{in the power of}} prayer, or things would have been avoided that have happened, that are awful. So it's a horrible position as an intelligent, emotional, yearning human being to sit outside of the available comfort there. But I just can't go there." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{a newborn}} involved, the {{decision}} is made more complex due {{to the principles of}} respect for autonomy and consent, as a newborn cannot understand or engage in a logical discussion of his own values and best interests. [...] A mentally more mature child <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> issues involved to some degree, and the physician and parents may elicit input from the child and weigh it appropriately in the decision-making process, although the law may not treat such input as legally informative. Ethicists and legal theorists also state that it is questionable for parents to make a decision for the child that precludes the child from making a different decision for himself later. Such a question can be raised for the decision by the parents either to circumcise or not to circumcise the child.|$|E
