50|$|The {{idler arm}} {{supports}} {{the end of}} the <b>center</b> <b>link</b> on the passenger's side of the vehicle. The idler arm bolts to the vehicle's frame or subframe. Generally, an idler arm is attached between {{the opposite side of the}} <b>center</b> <b>link</b> from the Pitman arm and the vehicle's frame to hold the <b>center</b> <b>link</b> at the proper height. Idler arms are generally more vulnerable to wear than Pitman arms because of the pivot function built into them. If the idler arm is fitted with grease fittings, these should be lubricated with a grease gun at each oil change.|$|E

50|$|The Pitman arm is a {{steering}} {{component in}} an automobile or truck. As a linkage attached to the steering box (see recirculating ball) sector shaft, it converts the angular motion of the sector shaft into the linear motion needed to steer the wheels. The arm {{is supported by the}} sector shaft and supports the drag link or <b>center</b> <b>link</b> with a ball joint. It transmits the motion it receives from the steering box into the drag (or <b>center)</b> <b>link,</b> causing it to move left or right to turn the wheels in the appropriate direction. The idler arm is attached between {{the opposite side of the}} <b>center</b> <b>link</b> from the Pitman arm and the vehicle's frame to hold the center or drag link at the proper height. A worn ball joint can cause play in the steering, and may get worse over time.|$|E
50|$|A {{parallelogram}} {{steering linkage}} is called such because like its name sake {{the two sides}} of the linkage run parallel to each other and are equal in distance. This type of steering linkage uses four tie rods, one inner and one outer on each side (left and right), a <b>center</b> <b>link</b> (which runs between the tie rods), an idler arm on the passenger side, and a pitman arm on the driver side. The pitman arm attaches to the steering gear output shaft which is also commonly called the pitman shaft. The pitman arm attaches to the <b>center</b> <b>link</b> and is moved by turning the steering wheel. The <b>center</b> <b>link</b> transfers the movement from the pitman arm and pitman shaft to the idler arm on the passenger side. The inner tie rods are mounted to the <b>center</b> <b>link</b> and transfer steering motion to the steering arms and outer tie rods. All of the joints which mount these components are constructed of small ball and socket joints to provide the necessary freedom of movement required to maintain control over the vehicle while it is in motion. The most common type of steering is the parallelogram. The cross-steer and Haltenberger linkage designs are used on some trucks and vans.|$|E

50|$|Action: The {{double joint}} reduces the {{nutcracker}} effect found in single-jointed snaffles. However, the middle link is angled {{relative to the}} side pieces of the bit. As a result, the thin edge of the <b>center</b> <b>link</b> can press into the tongue, creating a very small bearing surface. When a full-cheek Dr. Bristol is used, the bit can be rotated so that the angled middle joint lies flat with its broad side against the tongue; when used this way the bit is relatively mild. This latter method is only possible because bit keepers ensure the bit stays in a fixed position in the horse's mouth, and thus bits that do not use bit keepers (e.g., a D-ring or eggbutt) do not have this milder option.|$|E

30|$|In {{contrast}} to TSF methods, network traffic can be predicted leveraging other methods and features. For instance, Li et al. [274] propose a frequency domain based method for network traffic flows, {{instead of just}} traffic volume. The focus is on predicting incoming and outgoing traffic volume on an inter-data <b>center</b> <b>link</b> dominated by elephant flows. Their models incorporate FNN, trained with BP using simple gradient descent and wavelet transform to capture both the time and frequency features of the traffic time series. Elephant flows are added as separate feature dimensions in the prediction. However, collecting all elephant flows at high frequencies is more expensive than byte count for traffic volume. Therefore, elephant flow information is collected at lower frequencies and interpolated {{to fill in the}} missing values, overcoming the overhead for elephant flow collection.|$|E
