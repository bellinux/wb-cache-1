5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1959, Mona Best decided to open a club in her <b>cellar,</b> and offered the Les Stewart Quartet a {{residency}} if they would help convert the <b>cellar.</b> Harrison and fellow Quartet guitarist Ken Brown, however, missed a show, causing Les Stewart to fire the two and drop the residency. This caused distress to Best, but Harrison offered a solution: he recruited Lennon and McCartney to play, and they returned to calling themselves the Quarrymen. After helping Best finish converting the <b>cellar,</b> the new four guitarist line-up of the Quarrymen (Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Brown) opened the Casbah Coffee Club on 29 August 1959. The opening night performance was attended by about 300 local teenagers, but as the <b>cellar</b> had no air conditioning and people were dancing, the temperature rose until it became hard to breathe. The Quarrymen were afforded the use of Brown's three input amplifier (which, along with McCartney's Elpico, meant that all four guitarists were electric), and sang through one microphone connected to the club's small PA system.|$|E

The south wall of the building, which survives, was partly of stone and contains a large two-light early 14th-century window.
