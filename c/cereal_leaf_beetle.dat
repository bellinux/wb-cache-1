50|$|The <b>cereal</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> (Oulema melanopus) is a {{significant}} crop pest, described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758.|$|E
50|$|Adult and larval leaf beetles feed on {{all sorts}} of plant tissue, and all species are fully herbivorous. Many are serious pests of {{cultivated}} plants, for example the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), the asparagus beetle (Crioceris asparagi), the <b>cereal</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> (Oulema melanopus), and various flea beetles, and a few act as vectors of plant diseases. Others are beneficial due to their use in biocontrol of invasive weeds. Some Chrysomelidae are conspicuously colored, typically in glossy yellow to red or metallic blue-green hues, and some (especially Cassidinae) have spectacularly bizarre shapes. Thus, they are highly popular among insect collectors.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the pest status of <b>cereal</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles</b> in Southern Belgium, the population densities of Oulema melanopus (L., 1758) and O. lichenis (Voet, 1806) were studied at Ciney and Louvain-la-Neuve during 1993 and 1994. During the two-year study period Oulema spp. populations had never reached the economic threshold of 2. 5 larvae per tiller. The levels of the Oulema populations were significantly different between the 2 sites in 1994; Louvain-la-Neuve supporting greater densities than Ciney. Phenological differences between the two locations were postulated {{to be the result of}} two phenomena : (1) the early attainment of the physiological time of development, expressed in degree days, necessary for immature stage development, in Louvain-la-Neuve, the warmest location, and (2) the early attainment of the cold sum necessary to end the adult diapause in Ciney, the coldest site, however this second argument stays as a hypothesis that must be tested...|$|R

40|$|Investigations of flag leaves {{anatomy of}} three winter wheat cultivars: Almari, Gama and Weneda {{were carried out}} as it was state that there are great {{differences}} in the intensity of <b>cereal</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> feeding on the leaves. In {{order to determine the}} features conditioning the differentiated resistance of these cultivars following parameters were measured: the thickness of leaf blade, the length of trichomes and their density in the adaxial epidermis, the number of silicon cells in 1 mm 2 epidermis and the thickness of the external cell walls of epidermis. The observations of cross section of the leaves were made in a light microscope and that of surface of the adaxial epidermis in a scanning electron microscope. In this study it was shown that Gama cv. distinguishes of the shortest trichomes with poor density, the lowest number of the silicon cells in 1 mm 2 and epidermis cells with the thinest walls. This features indicate a poor resistance of Gama cv. against feeding of the pests and give reasons for the presence a much higher number of the <b>cereal</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae (about 100 %) than at the extant two cultivars. Dependence between the thickness of leaf blades and the number of larvae of the infesting pests has not been stated...|$|E

40|$|<b>Leaf</b> <b>beetles</b> (Chrysomelidae) {{are one of}} {{the most}} diverse {{families}} of herbivorous insects. Many of them are important agricultural pests and cause remarkable loss of crop and money as well. Plant leaves and roots are primary food source of both larva and adults of <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles.</b> Plants produce many secondary metabolites in reaction to herbivore insects. It is a well-known phenomenon that quantity and variety of secondary metabolites in plant leaves may change in response to insect attacks. Herbivore insects have to deal with such defensive secondary chemicals and overcome either by detoxifying or storing them. Accordingly, many specialist herbivores coevolved with their host plant. Certain phenolic glycosides may reduce <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> feeding. Condensed tannins are anti-herbivore defenses against <b>leaf</b> chewing <b>beetles,</b> including <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles.</b> Flavonoid compounds are feeding deterrents for many flea <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles.</b> Cinnamic acid derivatives are other known feeding deterrents for <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles.</b> Secondary metabolites quantity and nutritional quality of host plants are not only important for feeding but also for providing enemy-free space and suitable oviposition sites. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{univoltine}} {{life cycle}} of the <b>cereal</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> Oulema melanopus (L.) in Michigan (Castro et al. 1965) {{is similar to that}} reported by Venturi (1942) in Europe. Adults emerge from pupal cells in the soil in mid-June to early July, feed voraciously for about three weeks, and enter aestivation sites. For the remainder of the summer and early autumn only a few adults can be found feeding on late-maturing native grasses. The beetles overwinter and usually emerge in late March to early April and resume feeding. Mating and oviposition occur, and larval development is usually completed by late June in southern Michigan. Techniques for rearing the <b>cereal</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> on greenhouse-grown small grain seedlings have been developed by Connin, et al. (1968). Maintaining these cultures requires collecting field adults, growing host material, and handling the cultures to insure that all stages will be available for study. In Michigan during July adults can be collected more economically and in greater numbers in the field than by rearing in the laboratory. A summary of collection techniques, laboratory feeding and storage conditions for large numbers of field-collected cereal leaf beetles is presented in this paper. In addition, the mortality during storage of newly emerged field collected beetles fed either barley seedlings or an artificial diet is compared...|$|E
