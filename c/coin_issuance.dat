5|$|Dole and {{his allies}} in the {{legislature}} used the <b>coin</b> <b>issuance</b> {{as a means of}} attacking the government, accusing Gibson and others of disobeying the laws, and demanding information on Spreckels' profits, which the government stated was about three percent after costs such as transport and insurance were calculated. The political fallout of the coinage was the 1884 election-year shift towards the Kuokoa (independent) Party in the legislature. The Currency Act of 1884, passed after the election, restricted acceptance of silver coin as payment to debts under $10, and limited the exchange of silver for gold at the treasury to $150,000 a month. The new silver coins were expected to flow into the Treasury in exchange for gold under this arrangement, but the government refused to implement the law until forced to by the Supreme Court. To avoid a financial panic, major private banks and businesses agreed to exchange gold for the new silver coins, in which there was little public confidence. But in February 1885, faced with a government refusal to pay out gold (of which the Treasury was almost bare), the private businesses stopped this arrangement. Negotiations followed, and the government reluctantly agreed to sequester more than $550,000 of the coins in a special account to back the banknotes then in circulation. Although this left the government with little liquidity, the increased confidence in its finances allowed it to borrow on a short-term basis. By mid-1885, sugar prices were rising, and prosperity was returning to the islands. Greater amounts of gold flowed into the islands, balancing the silver that was already there, and stabilizing the monetary situation. The Kalākaua coins became more acceptable, and by 1888, most of the non-US foreign silver had been exchanged for them. They remained in circulation during the turbulent years of the 1890s in Hawaii, as the monarchy fell and the short-lived republic ended in 1898 with annexation to the United States. Despite the urging of local interests, it was not until 1903 that Congress acted, ordering that the Hawaii silver coins be exchanged by January 1, 1904, or lose status as legal tender. By 1907, coins worth about $814,000 of the $1,000,000 originally issued had been redeemed; they were exchanged for US silver and melted down at the San Francisco Mint.|$|E

500|$|The Peace dollar was {{released}} into circulation on January 3, 1922. In common with all silver and copper-nickel dollar coins struck from 1840 to 1978, the Peace dollar had {{a diameter of}} , which was larger than the Mint's subsequently struck modern dollar <b>coins.</b> Its <b>issuance</b> completed the redesign of United States coinage that had begun with issues in 1907. Long lines formed at the Sub-Treasury Building in New York the following day when that city's Federal Reserve Bank received a shipment; the 75,000coins initially sent by the Mint were [...] "practically exhausted" [...] {{by the end of}} the day. Rumors that the coins did not stack well were contradicted by bank cashiers, who demonstrated for The New York Times that the coins stacked about as well as the Morgan dollars. De Francisci had paid Morgan for 50 of the new dollars; on January 3, Morgan sent him the pieces. According to his wife, de Francisci had bet several people that he would lose the design competition; he used the pieces to pay off the bets and did not keep any.|$|R
25|$|Before World War II, {{commemorative}} coins {{were always}} made of precious metals. The base metal coins were probably not considered appropriate for, or worthy of, honoring the nation or the ruling dynasty. However, during the 20th century, {{the use of}} precious metals for circulating currency became increasingly scarce. World War I and the world economic crisis of the 1930s brought about temporary or permanent abolition of the convertibility of bank notes to silver and gold <b>coins.</b> Gradually, the <b>issuance</b> of precious metal coins became increasingly restricted, and definitively abandoned about 1970. While the commemoratives of these decades continued to be issued predominantly in precious metals, their use as circulating currency became scarce or ceased entirely. Thus, the commemoratives developed into a separate class of coins with no immediately recognisable link to the coins and notes used in everyday transactions. This class of coins were collectors items, {{or in some cases}} objects for economic investment. With the ascendance of coin collecting as a hobby for larger numbers of people in the decades after World War II, commemorative coins came to be seen as treasured items, their beauty and impressive appearance readily appealing to many.|$|R
50|$|In 1951, the Central Bank {{took over}} <b>coin</b> <b>issuance</b> using the {{initials}} B.C.C.R. while introducing 5 and 10 centimo coins. These {{were followed by}} 1 and 2 colones in 1954, 50 centimos in 1965 and 25 centimos in 1967. In 1982-1983, 5 and 10 centimo coins were discontinued, the sizes of the 25 centimo to 2 colón coins were reduced and 5, 10 and 20 colón coins were introduced. Between 1995 & 1998, smaller, brass 1, 5 and 10 colón coins were introduced and coins for 25, 50 & 100 colones were added. 500 colones followed in 2003. Aluminium 5 and 10 colones were introduced in 2006. Coins of 1 colón are no longer found in circulation. In 2009 the larger, silver-coloured ₡5, ₡10 & ₡20 were gradually withdrawn leaving the small, lighter, ₡5 and ₡10 and the gold-coloured ₡5, ₡10, ₡25, ₡50, ₡100 & ₡500 coins circulating.|$|E

40|$|This article reviews {{trends in}} the use of {{currency}} in New Zealand and reports developments of particular interest. The value of currency in circulation continues to grow, but there was an unusual increase in high-denomination notes late in 2008, associated with public nervousness {{about the state of the}} financial sector. Our review of the quality of one denomination of banknotes in circulation suggests that they meet our high quality standards, and our checking of the authenticity of bank notes indicates that the rate of counterfeiting is very low by international standards. Finally, <b>coin</b> <b>issuance</b> continues at high rates, most likely as the public are still filling stores of coins at home. ...|$|E
5|$|The Civil War economy catalyzed a {{shortage}} of United States coinage—gold and silver coins were hoarded given their intrinsic bullion value relative to irredeemable paper currency at the time. In late 1861, to help finance the Civil War, the U.S. government borrowed gold coin from New York City banks in exchange for Seven-thirties treasury notes and the New York banks sold them {{to the public for}} gold to repay the loan. In December 1861, the Trent Affair shook public confidence with the threat of war on a second front. The United States Department of the Treasury suspended specie payments and banks in New York City stopped redeeming paper money for gold and silver. In the absence of gold and silver coin, the premium for specie began to devalue paper currency. After the New York banks suspended specie payments (quickly followed by Boston and Philadelphia) the premium on gold rose from 1–3% over paper in early January 1862 to 9% over paper in June 1862, by which time one paper dollar was worth 91.69 cents in gold. This fueled currency speculation (e.g., redeeming banknotes for silver coin which was then sold at a premium as bullion), and created significant disruption across businesses and trade. Alternate methods of providing small change included the reintroduction of Spanish quarter dollars in Philadelphia, cutting dollar bills in quarters or halves, refusing to provide change (without charging a premium for providing silver <b>coins),</b> or the <b>issuance</b> of locally issued shinplasters (i.e., those issued by businesses or local municipalities) was forbidden by law in many states.|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the euro coins in 2002 presented a unique opportunity to study the crossborder migration and the mixing process of coins in different euro-area countries. This note analyses how many euro coins flow from and into Germany and which composition of coins is to be expected in the long run. A simple model of coin migration is formulated and calibrated for Q 1 coins. The ratio of German coins circulating in Germany is likely to settle around 50 %if past growth of coin volumes continues. In contrast to banknotes, allocation of coin seigniorage depends on national <b>coin</b> <b>issuance.</b> Different national growth rates of coin volumes have important implications for coin seigniorage.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{proposes to}} disentangle and evaluate a particularly dense period of coin production in southern and central Greece {{around the turn}} of the fourteenth century 1. The two decades under analysis are characterised by multiple, at times rival, mints emitting large and varied silver-based (billon) penny coinages of the same overall French type ('deniers tournois'). Such coins were central to the accounting systems of the area and were deployed in a range of economic, administrative, and military contexts. New archaeometric data, combined with numismatic information, and embedded in the historical sources, allow us now to attempt a year-by-year and blow-by-blow account of <b>coin</b> <b>issuance</b> of three major mints and polities. Our emphases are on the political and economic determining factors, and the fundamental pieces in this puzzle are the minting standard, that is to say the percentage of silver which each issue contains, accompanied by its trace elements. The first shows us whether an issuer was willing or able to sustain a good quality and to add responsibly to the monetary stock, or alternatively maintained or expanded the same while jeopardizing stability. Comparative trace elements provide us with hints of common or diverse bullion supplies, shedding further light on the context and purpose of the individual coinages...|$|E
