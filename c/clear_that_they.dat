5|$|There {{was also}} great {{interest}} in human evolution. Neanderthal fossils were discovered in 1856, {{but at the time}} it was not <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> represented a different species from modern humans. Eugene Dubois created a sensation with his discovery of Java Man, the first fossil evidence of a species that seemed clearly intermediate between humans and apes, in 1891.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conviction}} for manslaughter in 1967 of the Christian Scientist mother of five-year-old Lisa Sheridan, who died without medical care in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the church lobbied the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) {{to add a}} religious exemption to the Code of Federal Regulations. Added in 1974, this stated that parents who did not provide medical treatment for a child for religious reasons would not be considered negligent. States were thereafter obliged to include exemptions or lose funding; {{the wording of the}} exemptions made <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> referred to Christian Science.|$|E

500|$|The {{stand-up}} sequences {{were shot}} against a black background. Although this made it <b>clearer</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not [...] "real", Moffat {{thought that it}} looked odd, and [...] "hell to look at". The same script used for the pilot, with minor changes, was reshot by Bob Spiers for the first episode of the series proper. Some footage, such as Mark and Becky's first meeting at the funeral, leading to episode one's shared director credit between Spiers and Kilby.|$|R

5|$|Doggett interrogates Dwight, and Scully interrogates Randall. Randall repeats Dwight's {{words as}} he reads his lips through a wall. Randall replies {{that he and}} Dwight are just exterminators. Later, Tammi returns home and meets up with Randall, and the two go to the bus station. It becomes <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> intend to run away together, but that Tammi must go get her stash of money. Meanwhile, Doggett finds phone records that show that Tammi and Chase had back and forth phone calls, late at night. Doggett and Scully search Tammi's apartment, and Doggett redials Tammi's phone, getting the bus station.|$|E
5|$|Having {{realised}} the Hungarian Estates' growing dissatisfaction, Matthias held a Diet in November. The Diet again authorized him to levy {{an extraordinary}} tax, stipulating that {{the sum of}} all taxes payable per porta could not exceed one florin. The Estates also made it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> opposed the war in Bohemia. George of Poděbrady died on 22 March 1471. The Diet of Bohemia proper elected Vladislaus Jagiello king on 27 May. The papal legate Lorenzo Roverella soon declared Vladislaus's election void and confirmed Matthias's position as King of Bohemia, but the Imperial Diet refused Matthias's claim.|$|E
5|$|However, Peloponnesians {{may have}} been party to Themistocles's stratagem, so serenely did they accept that they would now have to fight at Salamis. The Allied navy was thus able to prepare {{properly}} for battle the forthcoming day, whilst the Persians spent the night fruitlessly at sea, searching for the alleged Greek evacuation. The next morning, the Persians rowed into the straits to attack the Greek fleet; {{it is not clear}} when, why or how this decision was made, but it is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did take the battle to the Allies.|$|E

60|$|Mr Pickering {{retreated into}} {{the shelter of}} the bushes and mused upon this thing. It seemed to him that for centuries he had been doing nothing but retreat into bushes for this purpose. His perplexity had returned. He could imagine no reason why burglars should want to visit Lord Wetherby's studio. He had taken it for granted, when he had tracked them to the <b>clearing,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were on their way to}} the house, which was quite close to the shack, {{separated}} from it only by a thin belt of trees and a lawn.|$|R
5|$|Others who {{expressed}} {{their interest in}} running included Texas representatives Bill Flores and Michael McCaul, Georgia representative Lynn Westmoreland, Montana representative Ryan Zinke, and California representative and former Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa. However, several candidates made <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would only run if Ryan chose not to, including Issa, McCaul, and Minnesota representative John Kline. On October 12, Flores confirmed that he would run for Speaker, but stated that he would run only if Ryan {{stayed out of the}} contest.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is {{a biological}} {{process in which}} RNA molecules inhibit gene expression or translation, by neutralizing targeted mRNA molecules. Historically, it was known by other names, including co-suppression, post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), and quelling. Only after these apparently unrelated processes were fully understood did it become <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> all described the RNAi phenomenon. Andrew Fire and Craig C. Mello shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on RNA interference in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, which they published in 1998. Since the discovery of RNAi and its regulatory potentials, it has become evident that RNAi has immense potential in suppression of desired genes. RNAi {{is now known as}} precise, efficient, stable and better than antisense technology for gene suppression.|$|E
5|$|The Code sought {{not only}} to {{determine}} what could be portrayed on screen, but also to promote traditional values. Sexual relations outside of marriage could not be portrayed as attractive and beautiful, presented {{in a way that}} might arouse passion, nor be made to seem right and permissible. All criminal action had to be punished, and neither the crime nor the criminal could elicit sympathy from the audience. Authority figures had to be treated respectfully, and the clergy could not be portrayed as comic characters or villains. Under some circumstances, politicians, police officers and judges could be villains, {{as long as it was}} <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were the exception to the rule.|$|E

60|$|These people evinced {{no fear of}} the English, and it was <b>clear</b> <b>that,</b> {{although}} <b>they</b> {{might not}} themselves have seen a ship before, {{the presence of the}} Portuguese in these seas was known to the islanders, and the manner of their vessels.|$|R
50|$|It seems <b>clear,</b> however, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> parted as friends. Shortly {{before leaving}} England {{for the last}} time in 1795, Haydn wrote a set of three piano trios (H.XV:24-6), {{considered}} today by critics as outstanding, and dedicated them to Mrs. Schroeter.|$|R
5|$|The Mise of Lewes {{was signed}} {{on the day}} of Montfort's victory at the Battle of Lewes, though it is not known whether it {{happened}} during or after the battle. Neither are the terms of the document known, though it seems <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> involved conditions for further negotiations. These efforts at a permanent settlement fell through, however, and the support for Montfort's government gradually eroded. Henry's oldest son, Edward – the later King Edward Istarted a military campaign that ended in the Battle of Evesham in August 1265, where Earl Simon was defeated and killed. Parts of the baronial resistance still held out, {{but by the end of}} 1266 the final besieged garrison at Kenilworth Castle surrendered. The rebels were given pardons according to terms set out in the Dictum of Kenilworth.|$|E
5|$|To {{reestablish}} their {{supply lines}} and retake {{the towns of}} Bardaï, Zouar and Wour, the Libyans sent a task-force of 2,000 troops with T-62 tanks and heavy support by the Libyan Air Force into the Tibesti. The offensive started successfully, expelling the GUNT from its key strongholds, also {{through the use of}} napalm. This attack ultimately backfired, causing the prompt reaction of Habré, who sent 2,000 FANT soldiers to link with the GUNT forces. Also Mitterrand reacted forcefully, ordering a mission which parachuted fuel, food, ammunition and anti-tank missiles to the rebels, and also infiltrated military personnel. Through this action, the French made <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> no longer felt committed to keep south of the Red Line, and were ready to act whenever they found it necessary.|$|E
5|$|By dawn it was <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{had succeeded}} in {{penetrating}} the perimeter through {{a gap between the}} Australian platoons, and they began to engage them with machine-guns from a defilade position covered from fire by a steep dip in the ridgeline, and concealed by thick scrub. In the growing light, 1 and 3 Platoon were soon pinned down and suffered a number of casualties as they attempted to gain better fire positions with which to engage their attackers. At 06:00 a fighting patrol was dispatched to make contact with Company Headquarters, and as the section passed over a false crest on their way down the spur line they encountered the Chinese positions by chance. Attacking immediately, six Chinese were killed for the loss of one Australian, and the threat to A Company was eliminated. O'Dowd then launched a counter-attack with 3 Platoon assaulting the Chinese occupying the original 1 Platoon position. By 07:00 they had regained the feature and the Chinese were forced to withdraw under heavy fire from the Australians on the high ground, who again exacted a heavy toll. The night's fighting had cost A Company dearly however, and among the dead were the two New Zealand forward observers. In total they suffered more than 50 casualties—half their original strength. Meanwhile, on the right flank, D Company—under Captain Norm Gravener—held the summit of Hill 504 and was not heavily engaged during the night, while C Company—commanded by Captain Reg Saunders—was attacked only once.|$|E

5000|$|The Landlords {{wanted to}} reassert their feudal tyranny over the poor who have started {{becoming}} more vocal and by attacking the most vulnerable, women and children, {{they wanted to}} send a <b>clear</b> message <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would not allow anyone to disturb the social structure.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{having been}} forced to flee, Jachmann was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} rear admiral for his actions during the battle. The Prussians made several further patrols in the Baltic, but refused to seek a pitched engagement with the far superior Danish fleet. Instead, the Second Schleswig War was decided on land. Additionally, the arrival of an Austrian squadron in the North Sea allowed the Austrians and Prussians to break the Danish blockade of the North Sea coastal ports at the Battle of Heligoland on 9 May. The Austrians, fearing that a more aggressive operation to defeat the Danish fleet in the Baltic would provoke the British, kept their squadron in the North Sea {{for the remainder of the}} war. On 9 May, the two sides signed an armistice in London that took effect three days later, temporarily ending the fighting. The armistice lasted until 26 June, when fighting broke out again on land. The Austrian and Prussian naval forces in the North Sea supported operations to capture the islands off the western Danish coast. These advances, coupled with the capture of the island of Als in the Baltic Sea, forced the Danes to seek a second armistice on 29 June. Ultimately, Denmark sued for peace after it became <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had lost naval superiority and that Britain would not intervene in the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Out of options, Buchner opened negotiations, {{using those}} interned {{in the castle}} as hostages. Presenting them at the keep's door, he made <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be killed unless Ferdinand promised to spare his, his wife's and Sudermann's lives. Ferdinand acceded to Buchner's demand; some sources {{maintain}} that the Abbot of Heisterbach, one of the prisoners, had been treated decently by Buchner throughout his imprisonment in the castle and himself asked for Buchner's life to be spared. The prisoners were released. With much difficulty, {{given the state of}} mind of the besiegers, Ferdinand and Arenberg brought the Buchners and Sudermann out of the castle alive. Once the Buchners, Sudermann, and the hostages were clear of the fortress, Ferdinand released his troops, who were in an ugly mood and hungry for blood and plunder. All those who remained in the keep—soldiers, men, women and children—were killed, some inside the keep, some in the courtyard below; the slaughter lasted well into the night. The castle's 178 dead were buried in two mass graves whose locations remain unknown. Among those who perished in the destruction and storming of the castle {{was also one of the}} prisoners, a vicar from Hildesheim. The Hildesheim suffragan, too, was not among the rescued prisoners; he had died during his incarceration, a short while before the castle was stormed.|$|E

500|$|The pilot, {{directed}} by John Kilby, was filmed at Pebble Mill in Birmingham on 9–10 August 1990. It is practically {{identical to the}} first episode of the series proper; some scenes are even reused, notably the scene with Mark and Becky meeting when he accidentally turns up at a funeral. The reused footage {{gave rise to the}} first episode's shared director credit between Spiers and Kilby. The stand-up sequences were shot against a black background. Although this made it <b>clearer</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not [...] "real", Moffat thought that it looked odd. The pilot was transmitted on BBC2 as part of its Comic Asides series of pilot shows on 12 July 1991.|$|R
40|$|When we see, hear, {{and think}} about “color” and “shape,” etc., we evoke our {{experience}} and the event, etc. which is related to them. This is the action that is called the “association of ideas,” that is, “association. ” In this study, the author investigated Japanese university students’ associated images of the four seasons in Japanese and English. The questionnaire survey was done and the answers were analyzed using the text mining software. As a result, it was <b>cleared</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> evoke more images of the four seasons in Japanese than in English, the images in the katakana mark are more evoked {{in the case of}} English, and more positive images tend to be evoked for English expressions...|$|R
