5|$|Sports journalism expert Kimberly Bissell {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} <b>camera</b> <b>angles</b> used during the 2004 Summer Olympic Games beach volleyball games. Bissell found that 20% of the <b>camera</b> <b>angles</b> were focused on the women's chests, and 17% on their buttocks. Bissell theorized that the appearance of the players draws fans attention more than their actual athleticism.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{has stated}} that the film's <b>camera</b> <b>angles</b> and several shots allude to the video game's <b>camera</b> <b>angles,</b> such as the fight between Alice and the {{security}} guard. These include a scene near the beginning {{where there is a}} close up of Alice's eye. This is a direct reference to the title screen of the first game. In another scene, Alice awakes and hears a creepy sound, which is a reference to the plot of the first game.|$|E
5|$|Series creator Rob Thomas {{thought that}} the {{character}} would be a perfect role for Rudd, stating that he would perform it in a British accent and had high expectations for the comedy of the episode because it was being written by Enbom. However, Thomas did not release any details about Rudd's plot line in the episode before its airing. Rudd compared his character to Andrew Ridgeley and Peter O'Toole. In the scene in which Veronica meets Desmond, the film of <b>camera</b> <b>angles</b> while Kristen Bell was speaking were inadvertently destroyed, leading to these <b>camera</b> <b>angles</b> being filmed nearly six weeks later. Bell had to speak her lines without Rudd present.|$|E
40|$|This is a {{study of}} the use of <b>camera</b> <b>angle</b> as a device to convey point of view in the film To Kill a Mockingbird. At present both film theory and {{semiotics}} have various theories concerning the use of <b>camera</b> <b>angle.</b> There are many statements about what <b>camera</b> <b>angle</b> is supposed to do, but there has been very little research into how manipulation of <b>camera</b> <b>angle</b> has been applied in the cinema. Examples are given, but often they are either hypothetical situations or specific shots taken out of a larger work in order to illustrate a specific point. The basic theory for this piece of research is that <b>camera</b> <b>angle</b> {{can be used as a}} device to convey point of view. This conclusion can be drawn from drawing together various theories and presumptions about how <b>camera</b> <b>angle</b> can work in a film. But this theory has yet to be proven by an overwhelming body of research that supports this theory. For this or any theory to be held with greater certainty there needs to be research and investigation into its validity. - Because of the need for investigation, this study will test this theory in one particular film...|$|R

5|$|Three <b>camera</b> <b>angles</b> {{were used}} during Lorne's {{scene in the}} F-302. To save costs, one of the <b>camera</b> <b>angles</b> was {{operated}} by Kavan Smith himself, who held it on his lap. Elsewhere, the producers {{wanted to make the}} control chair rotate as Sheppard flies the city to make it different than any other actions involving the control chair. A stunt {{towards the end of the}} episode was used where Weir gets thrown after the beam grazes the tower. The stunt was not originally approved by the producers. A stuntwoman doubled Higginson as Weir during the sequence. The scene was rehearsed several times before filming the actual sequence. During the actual sequence, the stuntwoman wore a plastic mask to prevent the flying glass from injuring her face.|$|E
5|$|A mutant with {{dragonfly}} wings {{which are}} tattooed {{on her body}} and possesses acidic saliva. The make-up team took four hours to apply Angel's wing tattoo on Kravitz, and the visual effects team had to erase the tattoo in case the scene required Angel with the computer-generated wings. To depict flight, Kravitz stood on elevated platforms and was dangled on wires, at times from a helicopter to allow for varied <b>camera</b> <b>angles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Combinations also trigger special modes, {{including}} alternative <b>camera</b> <b>angles,</b> {{a sniper}} mode, and a snapshot mode, which unlocks more in-game secrets.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of <b>camera</b> <b>angle</b> on feeling empathy with a {{character}} in a video. In the movement of special support education, the method to facilitate empathy with others was needed to develop in children with developmental disorder. The video of "Watermelon" was used in this study as a material, because the <b>camera</b> <b>angle</b> of the watermelon's viewpoint was used and intend to feel empathy for the watermelon. Eighty-nine subjects were divided into the Master Type (MT) group and the Edited Tape (ET) group that excluded the <b>camera</b> <b>angle</b> of watermelon's viewpoint. After watching the video, the subjects were asked to respond to the questionnaire about empathy and the recall of the story. The results were as follows; 1) the subjects of the MT group felt more emotional attachment for the watermelon, 2) they responded more negative on adjectives such as frightening, afraid, etc., and 3) they recalled more scenes than that of the ET group. These results indicated that the <b>camera</b> <b>angle</b> of the viewpoint of a character brought about empathy and suggested that the <b>camera</b> <b>angle</b> would be the useful intervention method to facilitate understanding of others, intention of children with developmental disorders...|$|R
5|$|MediEvil 2 {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics upon release. The game was mostly praised for its rich, detailed graphics but was criticised by many reviewers for its bad <b>camera</b> <b>angles,</b> easy difficulty and {{for being too}} similar to the first game. The game received an aggregate score of 79% from GameRankings, slightly lower than its predecessor. At the 2000 BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards, MediEvil 2 won the best console game category.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Robert Wiemer, the episode was written by Ron Wilkerson and Jean Louise Matthias, with some uncredited revisions by René Echevarria. Stand-ins were used to perform the pieces by Picard and Daren, which required the use of close-up <b>camera</b> <b>angles</b> by the director. The episode was received warmly by critics reviewing it {{after the end of}} the series, who praised the performances of Hughes and Stewart.|$|E
5|$|The film advising company Warriors Inc. was enlisted {{to ensure}} the war scenes, {{including}} the attire worn by the actors, looked authentic. Former members of the U.S. military taught the actors how to handle, fire, and reload their weapons, as well as perform various tactical movements. The opening war scene was filmed over three weeks and required fifty stuntmen. Animatics were used to map out the necessary <b>camera</b> <b>angles</b> for filming.|$|E

The situation regarding the title shot at WrestleMania X, {{which was to be}} given to the winner, remained unresolved until the following week on Monday Night Raw.|$|E
5|$|The player {{may choose}} to begin flight on a runway or taxiway, or in the air. Aircraft are {{controlled}} via keyboard, joystick, head-mounted display or specialized input devices such as pedals. During flight, several third- and first-person <b>camera</b> <b>angles</b> may be selected. For example, the third-person Flyby View places the camera {{in front of the}} plane as it flies past, while the first-person Three-Way View displays more information about the plane's position and speed than other angles. Certain <b>camera</b> <b>angles,</b> including the Three-Way View and 3-D Cockpit view, provide the player with simulated flight instruments such as an altimeter, airspeed indicator, accelerometer, variometer and tachometer. The game is designed to allow players to perform aerobatic maneuvers such as the Immelmann turn, tailslide, Lomcevak and Cuban Eight. Performances may be recorded and played back, with controls that allow the player to pause, rewind and fast forward. At any time, the player may stop a recording and resume flight from that point.|$|E
5|$|While Moffat was {{creating}} the clockwork automata he first decided {{to hide their}} faces with wigs, but when producer Phil Collinson told him this would severely limit <b>camera</b> <b>angles,</b> {{and that it could}} appear comical, the androids were given carnival masks to wear. Neill Gorton of Millennium Effects designed the androids and they were constructed by Richard Darwen and Gustav Hoegan.|$|E

5|$|A {{survival}} horror storyline {{usually involves}} {{the investigation and}} confrontation of horrific forces, and thus many games transform common elements from horror fiction into gameplay challenges. Early releases utilized <b>camera</b> <b>angles</b> seen in horror films, which allowed enemies to lurk {{in areas that are}} concealed from the player's view. Also, many survival horror games make use of off-screen sound or other warning cues to notify the player of impending danger. This feedback assists the player, but also creates feelings of anxiety and uncertainty.|$|E
