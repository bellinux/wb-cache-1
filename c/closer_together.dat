5|$|As {{a result}} of their {{increasing}} isolation from the majority of anti-war anarchists, George Woodcock notes that Kropotkin and anarchists who supported his position drew <b>closer</b> <b>together</b> in the months that preceded the Manifestos creation. Several of these same men would later sign the Manifesto, including Jean Grave, Charles Malato, Paul Reclus, and Christiaan Cornelissen.|$|E

Reconstruction added new on-ramps that merge into the freeway's right lane, while also moving the carriageways of I-94 <b>closer</b> <b>together.</b>|$|E
5|$|A loon’s wail is a {{long call}} {{consisting}} of up to three notes, and is often compared to a wolf’s howl. It uses this call to communicate its location to other loons. The call is given {{back and forth between}} breeding pairs or an adult and its chick, either to maintain contact or in an attempt to move <b>closer</b> <b>together</b> after being separated. It is a loud aaoo, weee-wea weee-wea weee-wea, or ooo-aaah-éééé.|$|E
5|$|According to GamesRadar, {{the release}} of Sonic Advance {{signified}} {{the end of the}} console wars, a notorious rivalry between Sega and Nintendo that lasted throughout much of the 1990s. The two companies would work <b>closer</b> <b>together</b> in subsequent years, collaborating {{for the first time in}} 2003 with F-Zero GX and, in 2007, both Sonic and Nintendo's mascot Mario would feature in Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{motion is}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} anatomical plane it occurs in. Flexion and extension are examples of angular motions, in which two axes of a joint are brought <b>closer</b> <b>together</b> or moved further apart. Rotational motion may occur at other joints, for example the shoulder, and are described as internal or external. Other terms, such as elevation and depression, describe movement above or below the horizontal plane. Many anatomical terms derive from Latin terms with the same meaning.|$|E
5|$|Narcissus {{appears to}} have arisen {{in the area of}} the Iberian peninsula, {{southern}} France and north-western Italy, and within this area most sections of the genus appeared, with only a few taxa being dispersed to North Africa at a time when the African and West European platforms were <b>closer</b> <b>together.</b> Subgenus Hermione in turn arose in the southwestern mediterranean and north west Africa. However, these are reconstructions, the Amaryllidaceae lacking a fossil record.|$|E
5|$|As a {{constitutional}} monarch, his education was {{followed closely by}} the National Assembly, which demanded from Itanhaém progress reports concerning his studies. During this time, Pedro II was kept unaware of events occurring outside the palace, including political matters. News which did intrude upon the emperor and his sisters concerned deaths within their family. In December 1834, they learned of the early and unanticipated death of their father. A few months later their grandfather Francis II, who had shown great interest in his grandchildren, died (June 1835). These losses drew the emperor and his sisters <b>closer</b> <b>together</b> and strengthened their sense of family, {{despite the absence of}} their parents.|$|E

50|$|A related {{classification}} {{though not}} a binary system is Optical binary which refers to objects that are so <b>close</b> <b>together</b> in the sky that {{they appear to be}} a binary system but are not. Such objects merely appear to be <b>close</b> <b>together,</b> but lie at different distances from the solar system.|$|R

5|$|Birds {{returning}} {{north in}} spring across the central Mediterranean appear {{to follow a}} well-defined route. Large concentrations of ruffs form every year at particular stopover sites to feed, and individuals marked with rings or dye reappear in subsequent years. The refuelling sites are <b>closer</b> <b>together</b> than the theoretical maximum travel distance calculated from the mean body mass, and provide evidence of a migration strategy using favoured intermediate sites. The ruff stores fat as a fuel, but unlike mammals, uses lipids as {{the main energy source}} for exercise (including migration) and, when necessary, keeps warm by shivering; however, little research has been conducted on the mechanisms by which they oxidise lipids.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, the MTA began {{automating}} the subway by Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC). CBTC supplements, rather than replaces, the fixed-block signal system; it allows trains to operate <b>closer</b> <b>together.</b> The BMT Canarsie Line, {{on which the}} L train runs, was chosen for pilot testing {{because it is a}} self-contained line that does not operate in conjunction with other lines. CBTC became operational in February 2009. Due to an unexpected ridership increase, the MTA ordered additional cars, and increased service from 15 trains to 26 trains per hour, an achievement beyond the capability of the block system. The total cost of the project was $340 million.|$|E
5|$|Independent {{lines of}} {{evidence}} from Type Ia supernovae and the CMB {{imply that the}} universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as dark energy, which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything <b>closer</b> <b>together,</b> gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused {{the expansion of the}} universe to slowly begin to accelerate.|$|E

5|$|Sang Penari was {{directed}} by Ifa Isfansyah. Husband and wife team Wong Aksan and Titi Sjuman were chosen to do the scoring, which they spent {{a month and a}} half on; they later said that work on the film brought them <b>closer</b> <b>together.</b> Shanty Harmayn, who had previously worked on Pasir Berbisik (Whispering Sands; 2004), was chosen to produce, while Salman Aristo, known for his scripts for Ayat-Ayat Cinta (Verses of Love; 2008) and Laskar Pelangi (Rainbow Warriors; 2009) spearheaded the writing. The screenplay went through twelve drafts and took two years of research.|$|E

It includes software that allows the user to upload, view, and email photos taken with the camera. The user zooms {{in and out of}} photos by sliding two fingers further apart or <b>closer</b> <b>together,</b> much like Safari. The Camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the pictures that have been taken with the iPad's camera. Those pictures are also available in the Photos application, along with any transferred from iPhoto or Aperture on a Mac, or Photoshop on a Windows PC.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} {{handling of}} Luftflotte 3 {{was not good}} either. The escorting fighters of StG 77 were stretched too far across a 30-mile front. By chance half of the defending fighters went into action {{against one of the}} attacking Ju 87 groups with disastrous results for the group concerned. The German fighters, which outnumbered the RAF units by 2:1, were unable to protect the Stuka units. Had the targets been <b>closer</b> <b>together,</b> the concentration of fighters would have allowed the Germans to destroy more RAF fighters in the air, while protecting their charges.|$|E

5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble {{observed that}} the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction. Assuming the Copernican principle (that the Earth is not {{the center of the}} universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were <b>closer</b> <b>together.</b> The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.|$|E
5|$|As Harry learns {{more about}} his great enemy, the love lives of the main {{characters}} start to become more active. Ron and Hermione grow <b>closer</b> <b>together,</b> but after learning from his sister Ginny that Hermione had previously kissed Viktor Krum, Ron shuns her. Harry's attempts to repair things between the two fail, resulting in Ron going out with Lavender Brown and making Hermione jealous. After Ron is nearly killed in an attempt on Dumbledore's life, he and Hermione reconcile. Ron and Lavender break up when Lavender sees {{the two of them}} walking out of the boys dormitories together. However, this was only because she hadn't noticed Harry walking ahead of them. Harry develops feelings for Ginny, but is reluctant to pursue her for most of the year because of his friendship with Ron. Following a wild Quidditch victory Harry and Ginny finally strike up a relationship, with Ron's reluctant consent.|$|E
5|$|Examination of the underdrawing {{shows that}} the artist {{intended}} a van Eyckian angel crowning the Virgin, but this was omitted from the final painting. He heavily reworked {{the positions of the}} three main figures even towards the end of completion. The draperies of the mantles were at first larger. Christ's body at first faced Luke, but was later tilted in the direction of his mother. The mother and child were brought <b>closer</b> <b>together.</b> Luke's head was at first level with the Virgin's, but in the final painting is raised slightly above. The differences extend beyond those in the foreground. The fortifications of the inner courtyard have been enlarged, while the two figures looking out over the river were smaller, the river itself narrower.|$|E
