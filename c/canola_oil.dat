The major active components of olive oil include oleic acid, phenolic compounds and squalene which have different benefits such as cancer prevention, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, and lowering the incidence of skin cancer, respectively. In recent years, the number of studies about the biochemical properties of different varieties of olive oils and their phenolic contents has dramatically increased. In this study, Turkish EVOO from different varieties and their phenolic compounds were investigated in terms of their antimicrobial and antioxidant properties as well as refined olive, hazelnut and <b>canola</b> <b>oils.</b> Antimicrobial activities of EVOOs and ten phenolic compounds were tested against three foodborne pathogenic bacteria, Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella Enteritidis which are the foremost bacterial cause of the largest number of outbreaks, cases and deaths in the world. While all EVOOs showed bactericidal effect the phenolics demonstrated slight antimicrobial activity with percent inhibition between 0 - 25 of growth rate of bacteria. Moreover, refined olive, hazelnut and <b>canola</b> <b>oils</b> did not show any antimicrobial activity. Finally, antioxidant activities of EVOOs, refined olive, hazelnut and <b>canola</b> <b>oils</b> were determined by B-carotene-linoleic acid model system and ABTS radical scavenging method. According to B-carotene-linoleic acid method, it was observed that antioxidant activities of oil samples varied between 21. 19 % and 64. 54 %. On the other hand, it was found that free radical scavenging activities varied between 1. 21 % and 21. 97 % as a result of ABTS method. These results were correlated with TPC values of oils...|$|R

25|$|Since the 1950s, it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that consumption of foods containing high amounts of saturated fatty acids (including meat fats, milk fat, butter, lard, coconut oil, palm oil, and palm kernel oil) is potentially less healthy than consuming fats with a lower proportion of saturated fatty acids.

50|$|DAGs and TAGs {{are natural}} {{components}} in all vegetable oils. Through an enzymatic process, the DAG {{content of a}} combination of soy and <b>canola</b> <b>oils</b> is significantly increased. Unlike TAG, which is stored as body fat, DAG is immediately burned as energy. With DAG-rich oil containing more than 80% DAG, less of the oil is stored as body fat as compared to traditional oils, which are rich in TAG. Excess calories consumed by the body are converted into fat and stored, regardless if it is consumed as DAG or TAG.|$|R

25|$|In the {{processing}} of edible oils, the oil is heated under vacuum to near the smoke point, and water is introduced {{at the bottom of}} the oil. The water immediately is converted to steam, which bubbles through the oil, carrying with it any chemicals which are water-soluble. The steam sparging removes impurities that can impart unwanted flavors and odors to the oil. Deodorization is key to the manufacture of vegetable oils. Nearly all soybean, corn, and <b>canola</b> <b>oils</b> found on supermarket shelves go through a deodorization stage that removes trace amounts of odors and flavors, and lightens the color of the oil.|$|R
25|$|Palm oil {{contains}} more saturated fats than <b>canola</b> <b>oil,</b> corn oil, linseed oil, soybean oil, safflower oil, and sunflower oil. Therefore, palm oil can withstand deep frying at higher temperatures and is resistant to oxidation compared to high-polyunsaturated vegetable oils. Since about 1900, palm oil has been increasingly incorporated into food {{by the global}} commercial food industry because it remains stable in deep frying, or in baking at very high temperatures, and for its high levels of natural antioxidants.|$|E
25|$|Mayo Clinic has {{highlighted}} certain oils {{that are}} high in saturated fats, including coconut, palm oil and palm kernel oil. Those having lower amounts of saturated fats {{and higher levels of}} unsaturated (preferably monounsaturated) fats like olive oil, peanut oil, <b>canola</b> <b>oil,</b> soy and cottonseed oils are generally healthier. The US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute urged saturated fats be replaced with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, listing olive and canola oils as sources of healthier monounsaturated oils while soybean and sunflower oils as good sources of polyunsaturated fats. One study showed that consumption of non-hydrogenated unsaturated oils like soybean and sunflower are preferable to the consumption of palm oil for lowering the risk of heart disease.|$|E
25|$|Plant-based, or vegetarian, {{sources of}} Omega 3 fatty acids include soy, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, <b>canola</b> <b>oil,</b> kiwifruit, hempseed, algae, chia seed, flaxseed, echium seed and leafy {{vegetables}} such as lettuce, spinach, cabbage and purslane. Purslane contains more Omega 3 {{than any other}} known leafy green. Olives (and olive oil) are another important plant source of unsaturated fatty acids. Plant foods can provide alpha-linolenic acid which the human body uses to synthesize the long-chain n-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. EPA and DHA can be obtained directly in high amounts from oily fish or fish oils. Vegetarians, and particularly vegans, have lower levels of EPA and DHA than meat-eaters. While {{the health effects of}} low levels of EPA and DHA are unknown, it is unlikely that supplementation with alpha-linolenic acid will significantly increase levels. Recently, some companies have begun to market vegetarian DHA supplements containing seaweed extracts. Similar supplements providing both DHA and EPA have also begun to appear. Whole seaweeds are not suitable for supplementation because their high iodine content limits the amount that may be safely consumed. However, certain algae such as spirulina are good sources of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), linoleic acid (LA), stearidonic acid (SDA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid (AA).|$|E

50|$|Castor oil is {{well known}} {{as a source of}} ricinoleic acid, a monounsaturated, 18-carbon fatty acid. Among fatty acids, ricinoleic acid is unusual in that it has a {{hydroxyl}} functional group on the 12th carbon. This functional group causes ricinoleic acid (and castor oil) to be more polar than most fats. The chemical reactivity of the alcohol group also allows chemical derivatization that is not possible with most other seed oils. Because of its ricinoleic acid content, castor oil is a valuable chemical in feedstocks, commanding a higher price than other seed oils. As an example, in July 2007, Indian castor oil sold for about US$0.90 per kilogram (US$0.41 per pound) whereas U.S. soybean, sunflower and <b>canola</b> <b>oils</b> sold for about US$0.30 per kilogram (US$0.14 per pound).|$|R

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} the development of a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic method for the determination of Solid Fat Index (SFI) of fats as a possible replacement of the traditional dilatometric procedure. The initial approach considered was the use of an existing FTIR analytical package which was designed to measure iodine value (IV), saponification number (SN), and cis and trans content. It was hypothesized that these measures could be related to SFI using multiple linear regression (MLR), thereby allowing the existing analytical package to simultaneously make SFI measures. It was found that there was a strong relationship between SN/cis/trans measurements and SFI, especially in sequentially hydrogenated oils. The MLR relationships, however, did not reproduce the dilatometric SFI values with sufficient accuracy in the general case, and this approach had to be abandoned. Subsequently, a partial least squares (PLS) calibration approach was investigated, relating the dilatometric SFI data directly to the spectral characteristics of the melted fats. It was found that suitable PLS calibrations could be developed for soybean and <b>Canola</b> <b>oils.</b> Based on these results, an FTIR system was programmed to determine SFI and the performance of the system validated using pre-analyzed "unknowns". It was shown that the SFI of either soybean or <b>Canola</b> <b>oils</b> could be determined to within $ pm$ 1. 0 SFI. As configured, the FTIR system is capable of determining the SFI of a neat and clear, melted fat sample at 80 $ sp circ$C in less than two minutes, providing four SFI values, representing the solids content at 50, 70, 80 and 92 $ sp circ$F. In contrast to the standard dilatometric method, which takes over two hours to carry out, the FTIR approach provides a rapid means of determining SFI, the technique being suitable for routine quality control applications in the fats and oils industry...|$|R
