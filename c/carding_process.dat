[...] Shortly thereafter {{he was both}} drafted into the U.S. Navy and married his bookkeeper, Ella Mae Bennett, who managed the business in his absence. In the 1950s, Hollingsworth perfected metallic card clothing, revolutionizing the textile <b>carding</b> <b>process.</b> He also purchased and rebuilt used cards for sale. Though Hollingsworth products and his reputation for excellent service soon made him a wealthy, internationally significant manufacturer of textile machinery, {{he could be a}} slapdash businessman. In 1964, a newly hired accountant was horrified to discover that although Hollingsworth's company had annual sales of about $9 million, the business was not incorporated and Hollingsworth had kept no accounting books. Hollingsworth was also overly enamored of innovative textile machinery and made many uneconomical purchases.|$|E
50|$|Knitters {{probably}} {{began using}} Fair Isle patterning {{in the early}} 1900s (decade), contrasting shades and colours of wool. As they now use only natural colours, the range is limited to whites, greys, browns and blacks, or a combination produced during the <b>carding</b> <b>process.</b> Most knitwear includes {{only two or three}} colours. In sweaters, the colours form either geometric or representational designs. Characteristically they are placed horizontally on the mid-portion of the body of the sweater. If the design in this centre portion is geometric, it is laid out in a broad band and repeated on the sleeves. If the main design is representational, it is usually centred on the back, with the same design on the front of a pullover, or two smaller versions of the same representation {{on either side of the}} front on a cardigan. There are usually geometric motif bands above and below the representational figure, which are also repeated on the sleeves.|$|E
40|$|Usually, a <b>carding</b> <b>process</b> is {{difficult}} to control with classic control algorithms (such as PID) for three main reasons: strong stochastic disturbance, time delays, and parameter variation. In this paper, generalized predictive control (GPC) is introduced to control such a process. First, a CARIMA model is built to describe the <b>carding</b> <b>process,</b> then the GPC control law is derived and used to design the controller for a carding autoleveler. The simulation {{results show that the}} GPC controller can greatly reduce a sliver's standard deviation and can reject measured and unmeasured step disturbance. Although this paper mainly involves the design of a feedforward-feedback GPC controller for a carding autoleveler, the methods of modeling and GPC controller design can easily be extended to a feedback case and used to design controllers for other preparatory machines' autolevelers.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} parameters to be controlled during the production of textile yarns obtained by mixing pre-colored fibers, is the color correspondence between the manufactured yarn and a given reference, usually provided by a designer or a customer. Obtaining yarns from raw pre-colored fibers is a complex manufacturing process entailing a number of steps such as laboratory sampling, color recipe corrections, blowing, carding and spinning. <b>Carding</b> <b>process</b> is the one devoted to transform a “fuzzy mass” of tufted fibers into a regular mass of untwisted fibers, named “tow”. During this process, unfortunately, the correspondence between the color of the tow and the target one cannot be assured, thus leading to yarns whose color differs from the one used for reference. To solve this issue, the main aim of this work is to provide a system able to perform a spectral camera-based real-time measurement of a carded tow, to assess its color correspondence with a reference carded fabric and, at the same time, to monitor the overall quality of the tow during the <b>carding</b> <b>process.</b> Tested against a number of differently colored carded fabrics, the proposed system proved its effectiveness in reliably assessing color correspondence in real-time...|$|E

40|$|Carding is {{the first}} and only machine (in card process) which can {{eliminate}} neps, seed coat neps and the remaining impurities which cannot be eliminated by blowroom section. In case of carding machine the higher the production rate, the more sensitive the carding operation and the greater danger of negative influence onquality. So the optimization of speed is the prime factor today [1]. Excessive higher speed can lead to fiberdamage and higher neps generation which will downgrade the final product. Again lower speed will reduce production rate which is not acceptable. So {{we need to find out}} the optimum speed which results best for both production rate and quality. In carding machine actual carding action takes place between the cylinder and flats[1]. Generally the high production cards process higher flat speed. The speed of flats affect the <b>carding</b> <b>process</b> and quality of final yarn and in practice the flat is optimized...|$|E

A change in structure of the calendered samples caused a considerably lower thermal resistance i. e. better thermal conductivity. A change of the average value of thermal resistance after calendering related to non-calendered fabric mass between 150 and 500 g/m 2 ranged from 53. 9 to 41. 0 %.
