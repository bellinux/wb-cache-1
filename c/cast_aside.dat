The Emperor then offers to let Starkiller take Vader's place as his {{apprentice}} if Starkiller proves himself by killing Kota. Starkiller instead attacks the Emperor, who effortlessly crushes Starkiller with the Rogue Shadow, severely injuring him and killing Kota, Juno, and the Senators. The story ends with Starkiller's broken body being grafted with armor {{so he can}} serve as the Emperor's assassin, though Palpatine assures Starkiller that he, like Vader, will be <b>cast</b> <b>aside</b> when he finds a new apprentice. The Infinities expansion content builds on this ending.|$|E

Also then, Kogălniceanu blocked the republican gambit of his friend Ion Ghica, the acting Premier. When Carol threatened to leave the country and let he liberals deal with all subsequent problems, Kogălniceanu gathered together the party's moderates in a decisive show of support for the monarch.|$|E

To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just <b>cast</b> <b>aside.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 13 March 1943, in {{preparation}} for the Battle of Kursk, Hitler visited the Eastern Front at Smolensk. Originally the plan was for certain officers to shoot Hitler collectively at a signal given in the officers' mess during lunch. However, that plan was <b>cast</b> <b>aside.</b> Instead a second plan devised by General Henning von Tresckow's Nazi resistance group was carried out. Upon leaving, staff officer Heinz Brandt, who was traveling in Hitler's entourage, agreed to take a box containing two bottles of cognac to Colonel Helmuth Stieff who was stationed at Hitler's headquarters. The package was given to Brandt by Tresckow. The cognac bottles were actually a bomb placed into a casing, with a timer fuse. The plane took off with both Hitler and Brandt on board, but it arrived safely at the Wolf's Lair field headquarters in East Prussia. The bomb most likely failed to detonate because the extremely low temperatures in the unheated luggage compartment of the plane prevented the fuse from operating properly.|$|E

25|$|During the 14th to 17th centuries, a great Bhakti {{movement}} {{swept through}} central and northern India, initiated by a loosely associated group of teachers or Sants.

They taught that people could <b>cast</b> <b>aside</b> the heavy burdens of ritual and caste, and the subtle complexities of philosophy, and simply express their overwhelming love for God. This period was also characterized by a spate of devotional literature in vernacular prose and poetry in the ethnic languages of the various Indian states or provinces.|$|E

A concurring opinion by Chief Justice Warren E.

Burger concluded: “To hold {{that the act of}} homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to <b>cast</b> <b>aside</b> millennia of moral teaching.” Justice Lewis F. Powell later said he regretted joining the majority, but thought the case of little importance at the time.|$|E

25|$|From {{the fifteenth}} century, when the Tutsi arrived {{in what is}} now Rwanda as migrant pastoralists, to the onset of colonization, Rwanda was a feudal monarchy. A Tutsi monarch ruled, distributing land and {{political}} authority through hereditary chiefs whose power was manifest in their land and cattle ownership. Most of these chiefs were Tutsis. The land was farmed under an imposed system of patronage under which Tutsi chiefs demanded manual labor in return for the rights of Hutus to occupy their land. This system left Hutus with the status of serfs. Additionally, when Rwanda conquered the peoples on its borders, their ethnic identities were <b>cast</b> <b>aside</b> and they were simply labeled “Hutu”. Therefore, “Hutu” became an identity that was not necessarily ethnic, but rather just associated with subjugation.|$|E

An official announcement said that the junta “had considered and accepted General Thi's application for a vacation”.

Despite Thi's {{good relations with the}} Buddhists in his area, most notably Thích Trí Quang, Kỳ reportedly had the monks' support for Thi's removal.

25|$|Despite {{extensive}} restrictions, limitations, and hardships, Decembrists {{believed that}} they could improve their situation through personal initiative. A constant stream of petitions came out of Petrovsky Zavod addressed to General Leparskii and Emperor Nicholas I. Most of the petitions were written by Decembrists’ wives who had nobly <b>cast</b> <b>aside</b> social privileges and comfort to follow their husbands into exile. These wives joined {{under the leadership of}} Princess Mariia Volkonskaia, and by 1832, through relentless petitions, managed to secure for their men formal cancellation of labor requirements, and several privileges, including the right of husbands to live with their wives in privacy. Decembrists managed to gain transfers and allowances through persuasive petitions as well as through the intervention of family members. This process of petitioning, and the resultant concessions made by the tsar and officials, was and would continue to be a standard practice of political exiles in Siberia. The chain of bureaucratic procedures and orders linking St. Petersburg to Siberian administration was often circumvented or ignored. These breaks in bureaucracy afforded exiles a small capacity for betterment and activism.|$|E
