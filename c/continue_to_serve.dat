5|$|By 1209 de Gray was in Ireland {{serving as}} the king's governor, an office {{sometimes}} referred to as justiciar for Ireland. One possible reason for his appointment was to save him from being accused of ignoring the interdict on England. As a bishop, it was de Gray's ecclesiastical duty to enforce the interdict, but by going to Ireland, which was not under interdict, he could <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> the king without provoking the papacy. De Gray's chief policy in Ireland was to extend English rule, to which end he was involved in battles on the River Shannon and in Fermanagh. He also replaced the Irish coinage with English, and attempted unsuccessfully to make English laws applicable in Ireland. De Gray's term of office in Ireland coincided with a time of change in Irish governmental practices.|$|E

5|$|Fisher {{wanted to}} <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> as High Commissioner in London when his term expired in 1921, but Hughes {{did not permit}} it. Upon his return to Australia, there were {{attempts}} to secure Fisher a seat in parliament and lead the Labor Party once more, {{but he was not}} interested in doing so.

He caught a severe bout of influenza in September 1928 and died a month later. He is buried at Hampstead Cemetery in West Hampstead.|$|E

5|$|Industrial belts within Greater Dhaka {{is a major}} {{manufacturing}} hub, {{bounded by}} the Buriganga, Meghna, Dhaleshwari, Balu and Turag Rivers.

5|$|The {{restaurant}} was {{moved into the}} Berkeley Hotel in 2003 where it replaced Pierre Koffmann's La Tante Claire, {{in the same year}} that Wareing became Chef Patron of the Grill Room at the Savoy Hotel, and he was named Chef of the Year by Caterer and Hotelkeepers Catey Awards. The return to the Savoy meant that he was competing against Anton Edelmann, his former boss from the River Room at the hotel. Rather than serve a menu similar to the French driven Pétrus, Wareing chose to <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> the British cuisine that the Grill Room was known for, including his take on previous menu items such as steak and kidney pudding and potted shrimps. Pétrus went on to be awarded two Michelin stars and five AA Rosettes, while the Savoy Grill achieved its first Michelin star in the hotel's history in 2004.|$|E

5|$|SBS {{implementation}} on {{the corridor}} {{is planned for}} November 2017. In the Rockaways and in Broad Channel, due to less dense land uses, and due to lower utilization of stops, several existing Q52 and Q53 stops will be consolidated or discontinued. Q22 local service will <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> the stops in the Rockaways, while the low volume stops at Cross Bay Boulevard and 5th Road will be discontinued. A new stop at Rockaway Beach Boulevard and Beach 84th Street would replace stops at Beach 81st Street and Beach 86th Street on the Q52. In Broad Channel two stops would be relocated: the northbound stop at Cross Bay Boulevard and East 9th Road would be moved north to Noel Road to be symmetrical with the southbound stop, and the southbound stop at West 15th Road would be moved south to West 17th Road to be symmetrical with the northbound stop, and to be adjacent to a crosswalk. Stops on Woodhaven Boulevard would be modified as well: the stop at Atlantic Avenue would be moved north to 91st Avenue, allowing Q52 and Q53 service to use the overpass over Atlantic Avenue using the bus lane, as opposed to using the slow service road. Two SBS stops will be added–at 101st Avenue and Woodhaven Boulevard, and at Pitkin Avenue and Cross Bay Boulevard–to provide transfers to the Q8 and Q11, respectively. Stations on Woodhaven Boulevard at Jamaica Avenue, 91st Avenue and 101st Avenue, and at Cross Bay Boulevard at Liberty Avenue (northbound) and Rockaway Boulevard (southbound) would be new stations that {{were built in the}} median by the NYCDOT.|$|E
