This may vary from a rudimentary overview sufficient to allow the diver to avoid decompression obligation for entry level divers, to <b>competence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> use of several decompression algorithms by way of personal dive computers, decompression software, and tables for advanced technical divers.

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} a concept of {{communicative}} <b>competences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> curricula at the stage of pre-school education and introduces the possibilities of development of these <b>competences</b> <b>in</b> kindergarten. <b>The</b> theoretical part outlines issues of curriculum, key competences and communicative <b>competences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of pre-primary education. The research {{is a presentation of}} qualitative-quantitative research, which aimed to analyze the concept of communicative <b>competences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> curricula of kindergartens and based on direct observation to find out, how kindergarten teachers meet the communicative competences at this stage of education, how to diagnose them and what opportunities provides kindergarten environment to develop pre-school children communication competences. Based on the analysis of curriculum documents of selected kindergartens we found that schools include communicative <b>competences</b> <b>in</b> their conceptual materials and attach great importance to them, even if these documents have different content and formal level. From our observations and interviews with respondents, we concluded that kindergartens and their teachers usually provide good conditions for children to develop their communicative competences (positive communication climate, proper teacher speech pattern, primary prevention, [...] ...|$|R

25|$|Effective {{use of any}} {{alternate}} {{air source}} requires <b>competence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> associated skill set. The procedures for receiving air from another diver or from one's own equipment are most effective and least {{likely to result in}} a life-threatening incident if well trained {{to the extent that they}} do not distract the diver from other essential matters. A major difference from buddy breathing is that the diver using a redundant alternative air source need not alternate breathing with the donor, which can be a substantial advantage in many circumstances. There is a further significant advantage when the alternate air source is carried by the diver using it, in that it is not necessary to locate the buddy before it is available, but this comes at the cost of extra equipment.|$|E

25|$|Exposure to {{the various}} theories, models, tables and {{algorithms}} is needed to allow the diver to make educated and knowledgeable decisions regarding their personal decompression needs. Basic decompression theory and use of decompression tables {{is part of the}} theory component of training for commercial divers, and dive planning based on decompression tables, and the practice and field management of decompression is {{a significant part of the}} work of the diving supervisor. Recreational divers are trained in the theory and practice of decompression to the extent that the certifying agency specifies in the training standard for each certification. This may vary from a rudimentary overview sufficient to allow the diver to avoid decompression obligation for entry level divers, to <b>competence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> use of several decompression algorithms by way of personal dive computers, decompression software, and tables for advanced technical divers.

500|$|The one reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on August 26, 1910. The film likely saw a wide national release, advertisements in theaters are known in Indiana, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. The New York Dramatic Mirror gave the most detailed review of the trade publications by summing up the scenario and approving of the plot and the good acting in the production. The reviewer concluded, [...] "Not only are the leading roles well portrayed, but the minor parts are quite well done in the picture - the dismissed stenographer and the old landlady actually look and act their parts. There is a pleasing, symmetrical <b>competence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> whole cast." [...] The production was reviewed positively by The Moving Picture World and concludes with the statement, [...] "The story ends there without a suspicion of anybody {{falling in love with}} anybody else, a restraint which will be duly appreciated." [...] Bower's notes that many Thanhouser plots conclude with the romance and the reviewer noted this change was a welcome one for this production.
