5|$|The {{name of the}} taxonomic order, Coleoptera, {{comes from}} the Greek koleopteros (κολεόπτερος), given to the group by Aristotle for their elytra, {{hardened}} shield-like forewings, from koleos, sheath, and pteron, wing. The English name beetle comes from the Old English word bitela, little biter, related to bītan (to bite), leading to Middle English betylle. Another Old English name for beetle is ceafor, chafer, used in names such as <b>cockchafer,</b> from the Proto-Germanic *kabraz- (compare German Käfer).|$|E
25|$|When Italy {{entered the}} war the Iraqi {{government}} did not break off diplomatic relations, as they had done with Germany. The Italian Legation in Baghdad became the centre for Axis propaganda and for fomenting anti-British feeling. In this they were aided by Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, the British appointee as the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, who had fled from the British Mandate of Palestine shortly before the outbreak of war and later received asylum in Baghdad. In January 1941, there was a political crisis within Iraq as Rashid Ali resigned as Prime Minister of Iraq {{and was replaced by}} Taha al-Hashimi; civil war loomed. On 31 March, the Regent of Iraq, Prince 'Abd al-Ilah, learnt of a plot to arrest him and fled Baghdad for RAF Habbaniya, from whence he was flown to Basra and given refuge on the Insect class gunboat HMS <b>Cockchafer.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{meaning of}} the name has been {{translated}} differently; Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline translated it as [...] "The Adventures of Totor, C.P. of the June Bugs", while Tintinologist Harry Thompson instead translated it as [...] "The Adventures of Totor, patrol leader of the Cockchafers", but conversely, biographer Benoît Peeters had it as [...] "The Adventures of Totor, patrol chief of the Scatterbrains". ("" [...] is French for <b>Cockchafer,</b> a type of beetle, but also the French for [...] "scatterbrain").|$|E
5000|$|In 1810 {{came the}} Kampf den Maikäfern - the [...] "Struggle against the Cockchafers" [...] - and its larvae, the white grubs. One leaflet sent {{throughout}} the village declared that every farmer was to decrease this pest {{as much as}} he could, sparing no effort to that end. It furthermore suggested feeding the dead <b>cockchafers</b> to chickens, ducks and geese, with a warning that these birds should also get plenty of water, as <b>cockchafers</b> tended to make them very thirsty. Swine, too, enjoyed <b>cockchafers,</b> according to the leaflet.|$|R
6000|$|He became reminiscent, and {{suddenly}} a warm summer's evening {{came back to}} him. [...] "Remember them <b>cockchafers,</b> Ann?" [...] he said. But {{the reality of the}} evening he recalled was not the chase of <b>cockchafers.</b> The great reality that had suddenly arisen between them was that he had never kissed Ann in his life. He looked up and there were her lips.|$|R

500|$|According to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), {{the term}} [...] "bumblebee" [...] was first {{recorded}} {{as having been}} used in the English language in the 1530 work Lesclarcissement by John Palsgrave, [...] "I bomme, as a bombyll bee dothe." [...] However the OED also states that the term [...] "humblebee" [...] predates it, having first been used in 1450 in Fysshynge wyth Angle, [...] "In Juyll the greshop & the humbylbee in the medow." [...] The latter term was used in A Midsummer Night's Dream (circa 1600) by William Shakespeare, [...] "The honie-bags steale from the humble Bees."

6000|$|A great <b>cockchafer</b> came flying past; {{he caught}} sight of Thumbelina, and in a moment had put his arms round her slender waist, and had flown off with her to a tree. The green leaf floated away down the stream, and the {{butterfly}} with it, for he was fastened to the leaf and could not get loose from it. Oh, dear! how terrified poor little Thumbelina was when the <b>cockchafer</b> flew off with her to the tree! But she was especially distressed on the beautiful white butterfly's account, as she had tied him fast, so that if he could not get away he must starve to death. But the <b>cockchafer</b> did not trouble himself about that; he sat down with her on a large green leaf, gave her the honey out of the flowers to eat, and told her that she was very pretty, although she wasn't in the least like a <b>cockchafer.</b> Later on, all the other cockchafers who lived in the same tree came to pay calls; they examined Thumbelina closely, and remarked, 'Why, she has only two legs! How very miserable!' ...|$|E

5000|$|Children since antiquity {{have played}} with <b>cockchafers.</b> In ancient Greece, boys caught the insect, tied a linen thread {{to its feet}} and set it free, amusing {{themselves}} to watch it fly in spirals. English boys in Victorian times played a very similar game by sticking a pin through one of its wings. Nikola Tesla recalls that as a child he made {{one of his first}} [...] "inventions" [...] - [...] an [...] "engine" [...] made by harnessing four <b>cockchafers</b> in this fashion.|$|R
60|$|But worms {{who watch}} without concern The <b>cockchafer</b> on thorns, Or beetles smashed, {{themselves}} will turn If, {{walking through the}} slippery fern, You tread upon their corns.|$|E
60|$|The <b>cockchafer</b> who {{had stolen}} her knew this very well; {{but when he}} heard all the ladies saying she was ugly, he began to think so too, and would not keep her; she might go {{wherever}} she liked. So he flew down from the tree with her and put her on a daisy. There she sat and wept, {{because she was so}} ugly that the <b>cockchafer</b> would {{have nothing to do with}} her; and yet she was the most beautiful creature imaginable, so soft and delicate, like the loveliest rose-leaf.|$|E

60|$|And {{after a year}} or so the queer monstrous grub {{things in}} the field before the blacksmith's grew so big and {{developed}} into such frightful skipjacks and cockchafers--motor <b>cockchafers</b> the boys called them--that they drove Lady Wondershoot abroad.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of their}} long {{development}} time as larvae, <b>cockchafers</b> {{appear in a}} cycle of {{every three or four}} years; the years vary from region to region. There is a larger cycle of around 30 years superimposed, in which they occur (or rather, used to occur) in unusually high numbers (10,000s).|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, and a fat old <b>cockchafer</b> hitting {{you in the}} {{eye when}} you walked home. Smell of hay, and a moon as big as a bandbox sitting {{on the top of a}} haycock; bats,--roses,--milk and midges,' said Lowndes.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Slope was {{madly in}} love but hardly knew it. The Signora spitted him, as a boy does a <b>cockchafer</b> on a cork, that she might enjoy the {{energetic}} agony of his gyrations. And she knew very well what she was doing.|$|E
60|$|They {{had never}} before seen such a number of cockchafers, and the buzzing was so loud that the King was afraid he should be {{deafened}} by it. He asked the most distinguished-looking <b>cockchafer</b> they met if he knew where they could find the King of the Peacocks.|$|E
5000|$|Being {{often quite}} {{sizeable}} and swarming in numbers at certain times, {{for example the}} Amphimallon, Phyllophaga and Polyphylla [...] "june beetles" [...] or the Melolontha <b>cockchafers</b> [...] - [...] all from tribe Melolonthini [...] - [...] feature widely in folklore. Some Melolonthinae are economically significant pests. Other than the Melolonthini, the most diverse tribes are the Ablaberini, Liparetrini, Macrodactylini, Pachydemini and Sericini.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But we {{must not}} forget the others,' she said at last, and began to {{transform}} the fishes to their proper shapes. There were {{so many of them}} that it took quite a long time.

60|$|Glancing at Jeremiah, Clennam saw in {{his very}} gaiters that his {{attention}} was closely directed to them, though he stood {{leaning against the wall}} scraping his jaw, and pretended to listen to Flora as she held forth in a most distracting manner on a chaos of subjects, in which mackerel, and Mr F.'s Aunt in a swing, had become entangled with <b>cockchafers</b> and the wine trade.|$|R
6000|$|Something {{seemed to}} fall between them, and {{they no longer}} looked openly at one another. [...] "Lor'!" [...] cried Ann suddenly, [...] "see that one!"

60|$|From {{beyond the}} low hills {{across the water}} came the dull {{resonance}} of distant guns and a remote weird crying. Then everything was still.

5000|$|Christmas beetle {{is a name}} {{commonly}} {{applied to}} the Australian and South African beetle genus Anoplognathus [...] They are known as Christmas beetles because they are abundant in both {{urban and rural areas}} close to Christmas. Christmas beetles are large (20-30 mm long) members of the scarab family that are noisy and clumsy fliers, similar to the <b>cockchafers</b> of Europe. They typically have elytra that are a dark or light brown, or green, in some species with a green-yellow iridescence.|$|R
60|$|In {{front of}} the fire three men were sitting clothed in white, just as if it was summer, and for about thirty feet all round winter had been banished. The moss was dry and the plants green, while the grass seemed all alive with the hum of bees and <b>cockchafers.</b> But above the noise the son of Long Hans could hear the {{whistling}} of the wind and the crackling of the branches as they fell beneath the weight of the snow.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Slope {{was startled}} and horrified, {{but he felt}} that he could not answer. How could he stand up and preach the lessons of his Master, being there, as he was, on the devil's business? He was a true believer, {{otherwise}} this would have been nothing to him. He had audacity for most things, but he had not audacity to make a plaything of the Lord's word. All this the signora understood, and felt much interest as she saw her <b>cockchafer</b> whirl round upon her pin.|$|E
6000|$|Thereupon the King and the Prince {{made great}} friends with him, {{and they all}} walked arm-in-arm and dined together, and {{afterwards}} the <b>cockchafer</b> showed them all the curiosities of his strange country, where the tiniest green leaf costs a gold piece and more. Then they set out again to finish their journey, and this time, as they knew the way, they were not long upon the road. It was easy to guess that {{they had come to}} the right place, for they saw peacocks in every tree, and their cries could be heard a long way off: ...|$|E
60|$|Another disproof may {{be found}} in the 'fern web,' 'bracken clock' of Scotland; the tiny <b>cockchafer,</b> with brown wing-cases and dark-green thorax, which abounds in some years in the hay-meadows, on the fern, or on the heads of umbelliferous flowers. The famous Loch-Awe fly, {{described}} as an alder-fly with a rail's wing, seems to be nothing but this fat little worthy: but the best plan is to make the wings, either buzz or hackle, of the bright neck-feather of the cock pheasant, thus gaining the metallic lustre of the beetle tribe. Tied thus, either in Devonshire or Snowdon, few flies surpass him when he is out. His fatness proves an attraction which the largest fish cannot resist.|$|E

60|$|Brackets with vases and casts {{here and}} there {{projected}} from the walls, and some charming crayons and water-colours hung round them. The plastered walls had already been marked out in panels, and a growth of frescoes of bulrushes, ivy, and leaves of all kinds was beginning to overspread them, while on a nearer inspection the leaves proved to be fast becoming peopled with living portraits of butterflies and other insects; indeed Mary started at finding herself in, as she thought, unpleasant proximity {{to a pair of}} <b>cockchafers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Collecting adults {{was an only}} {{moderately}} successful method. In the Middle Ages, {{pest control}} was rare, and people had no effective means to protect their harvest. This gave rise to events that seem bizarre from a modern perspective. In 1320, for instance, <b>cockchafers</b> were brought to court in Avignon and sentenced to withdraw within three days onto a specially designated area, otherwise they would be outlawed. Subsequently, since they failed to comply, they were collected and killed. (Similar animal trials also occurred for many other animals in the Middle Ages.) ...|$|R
