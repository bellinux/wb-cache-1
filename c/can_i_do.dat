25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do {{not know what to do}} with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E
500|$|Guitarist Torn {{commented that}} Taborn is [...] "the rare {{musician}} {{who takes the}} approach, 'What <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> with this instrument?' rather than playing through its book of techniques.

But I've been training for a while and I actually— before I come to rehearsals— I've been working out and stuff like that so I won't have that predicament." ...|$|E

500|$|Civil service {{reform was}} a {{prominent}} issue following Harrison's election. Harrison had campaigned as {{a supporter of the}} merit system, as opposed to the spoils system. Although some of the civil service had been classified under the Pendleton Act by previous administrations, Harrison spent much of his first months in office deciding on political appointments. Congress was widely divided on the issue and Harrison was reluctant to address the issue in hope of preventing the alienation of either side. The issue became a political football of the time and was immortalized in a cartoon captioned [...] "What <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> when both parties insist on kicking?" [...] Harrison appointed Theodore Roosevelt and Hugh Smith Thompson, both reformers, to the Civil Service Commission, but otherwise did little to further the reform cause.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Braeden {{experienced}} multiple contract negotiation issues, {{leading to}} former executive producer and head writer Maria Arena Bell writing both Victor and Nikki (Melody Thomas Scott) {{out of the}} series. Their departures were reportedly due to sudden salary cuts {{in the middle of}} already negotiated contracts. During his onscreen absence, contract negotiations ensued with unknown predictions from the series. On the situation of the soap cutting his contract, Braeden stated during an interview: [...] "When I sign a three-year deal, I'm obligated to fulfill that deal. The producers, however, can come to me after a half-year and say, 'We've changed our minds.' Where in the world of business does this kind of contract exist? Do I blame the people for wanting to squeeze as much out of us as they <b>can?</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not. The question is, when do you squeeze too much?" ...|$|E
500|$|The Canadian {{government}} declined Mitsui's {{offer of}} military service. [...] A series of Orders in Council in 1942 deprived Canadians of Japanese descent {{of their property}} and rights, culminating in Japanese-Canadian internment {{for the duration of}} the war. [...] The government confiscated the Mitsui family's 17-acre property and poultry facilities in Coquitlam and sold it off, compensating the family with an estimated one-third of its total value. [...] The RCMP took Mitsui and his daughter Lucy to Hastings Park for registration as an enemy alien. [...] Mitsui wore his military medals and when the registering official asked him, [...] "What <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> for you, Sarge?", Mitsui responded, [...] "What are you doing to me? I served my country. [...] You've taken everything away from me.... What are the good of my medals?" [...] He scattered his medals on the floor and table, and refused to wear them thereafter when they were returned to him. [...] He and his family were detained in a facility in Greenwood, British Columbia. [...] Mitsui later stated, [...] "I had complete confidence in the government that they wouldn't be doing anything to me because of being a veteran." [...] All the family could later retrieve was a samurai sword Mitsui's son George had buried.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal played league challengers Newcastle United in {{the sixth}} round, on 9 March 2002. The timing of the game, {{influenced}} by the television schedulers, angered Wenger, who threatened to field a weakened side, to prioritise on their Champions League progress: [...] "The BBC have put us in this position of playing at 5.35pm on Saturday night instead of a noon kick-off. I don't know whether Newcastle would have played the game earlier on the Saturday but what <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> about the BBC? I feel it's being very unfair as {{we are the only}} side left in all three competitions." [...] It was the second meeting between both teams in a week, and in spite of Arsenal winning the first fixture and scoring the opener in the cup tie, Newcastle found [...] "new reserves of energy and determination" [...] to draw level and created numerous opportunities to win the game outright. With the game ending in a draw, a replay was scheduled two weeks later. Arsenal won 3-0, but more concerningly lost Pirès, who was carried off and subsequently ruled out {{for the remainder of the}} season with medial knee ligament damage. An own goal by Middlesbrough's Gianluca Festa, from an Henry free-kick in the semi-finals was enough to send Arsenal to their 15th FA Cup final.|$|E
500|$|In October 2014, American singer Alicia Keys {{confirmed}} that {{she worked on}} Madonna's upcoming studio album, saying [...] "It was good. I was in here doing a meeting or something and [...] was working with Diplo. They were like, 'Oh, maybe you can play some piano on this thing'. And I was like, 'Alright. I'll try. If you hate it, {{you can take it}} off'. It was just like that, casual and cool." [...] Annie from the London Community Gospel Choir provided the female background vocals throughout the song. Madonna also mentioned that new versions would be [...] "coming out, but just not yet". Describing the song as [...] "one of [...] more mellow productions", Madonna composed [...] "Living for Love" [...] as a break-up song, commenting, [...] "lots of people write about being in love and being happy or they write about having a broken heart and being inconsolable. But nobody writes about having a broken heart and being hopeful and triumphant afterwards. So I thought, how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> this? I didn't want to share the sentiment of being a victim. This scenario devastated me, but it just made me stronger". She complemented saying that [...] "Living for Love" [...] was [...] "kind of like the old me and the new me all mixed in together".|$|E

2500|$|The {{title of}} the album was later {{confirmed}} by 50 Cent {{in an interview with}} MTV News.

2500|$|Breaking Bad {{was created}} by Vince Gilligan, who spent several years writing the Fox series The X-Files.

[...] "Television is {{historically}} good at keeping its characters in a self-imposed stasis so that shows can go on for years or even decades," [...] he said. [...] "When I realized this, the logical next step was to think, how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> a show in which the fundamental drive is toward change?"

2500|$|It was Buñuel's {{intention}} to shock and insult the intellectual bourgeoisie of his youth, later saying: [...] "Historically the film represents a violent reaction against what {{in those days}} was called 'avant-garde,' which was aimed exclusively at artistic sensibility and the audience's reason."
