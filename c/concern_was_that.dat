5|$|By 1996 Widerøe had {{undertaken}} {{a series}} of operational amendments after recommendation from the commission, including a reorganization of the aircraft operation division, the quality insurance division and the company's reporting systems. Another <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> pilots did not follow the company's routines, resulting in the company grounding about ten pilots which did not follow policy or did too many errors during observations. Some would be receive additional training while others would be retired. The company would further invest 40 million Norwegian krone (NOK) to improve safety.|$|E
5|$|CGI {{special effects}} {{for the series}} were {{provided}} by The Mill. The production team wanted a talking dragon, but {{they were worried about}} the lip sync and did not think it would be believable until they saw the first test. The Mill created a software that would read Hurt's facial muscles and incorporated it into the animation. Another <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the eyes would not convey the character, but this was corrected by the final version. Additional sound effects, such as the clanging chain, were added to give the creature weight. The knife Mary throws at Arthur was also completely CGI, though the shot of it hitting the chair was real.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} {{noted that}} Great Lakes cargo vessels could normally avoid severe storms, {{and called for}} the establishment of a limiting sea state applicable to Great Lakes bulk cargo vessels. This would restrict the operation of vessels in sea states above the limiting value. One <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> shipping companies pressured the captains to deliver cargo as quickly and cheaply as possible regardless of bad weather. At the time of Fitzgeralds foundering, there was no evidence that any governmental regulatory agency tried to control vessel movement in foul weather despite the historical record that hundreds of Great Lakes vessels had been wrecked in storms. The USCG took the position that only the captain could decide when it was safe to sail.|$|E

5|$|The {{vessels that}} {{eventually}} became the Iowa-class battleships were born from the US Navy's War Plan Orange, a Pacific war plan against Japan. War planners {{anticipated that the}} US fleet would engage and advance in the Central Pacific, with {{a long line of}} communication and logistics that would be vulnerable to high-speed Japanese cruisers. The chief <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the US Navy's traditional 21-knot battle force would be too slow to force these Japanese task forces into battle, while faster carriers and cruiser escorts would be outmatched by the Japanese Kongō-class battlecruiser, which had been upgraded in the 1930s to fast battleships. Even during the development process of the North Carolina-class and South Dakota-class battleships, designs that could achieve 30 knots were seriously considered.|$|E
5|$|A {{report in}} the American Chess Bulletin (July–August 1920 issue) said that Lasker had {{resigned}} the world title in favor of Capablanca because {{the conditions of the}} match were unpopular in the chess world. The American Chess Bulletin speculated that the conditions were not sufficiently unpopular to warrant resignation of the title, and that Lasker's real <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> there was not enough financial backing to justify his devoting nine months to the match. When Lasker resigned the title in favor of Capablanca he was unaware that enthusiasts in Havana had just raised $20,000 to fund the match provided it was played there. When Capablanca learned of Lasker's resignation he went to the Netherlands, where Lasker was living at the time, to inform him that Havana would finance the match. In August 1920 Lasker agreed to play in Havana, but insisted that he was the challenger as Capablanca was now the champion. Capablanca signed an agreement that accepted this point, and soon afterwards published a letter confirming this. Lasker also stated that, if he beat Capablanca, he would resign the title so that younger masters could compete for it.|$|E
5|$|By late April, British {{attention}} {{had shifted}} to the Middle East due to the Anglo-Iraqi War, although the situation was resolved {{by the end of}} May. A greater <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> German and Italian forces had intervened in Iraq, using bases in Vichy Syria. With Germans and Italians threatening to gain full control of the French territory, thus jeopardising the British position in the Middle East, the Allies invaded Syria (Operation Exporter) on 8 June. In the face of stiff resistance from the Vichy French, the British realised that reinforcements were needed. On 13June, the 6th Infantry Division (with two infantry brigades) was ordered to reinforce the effort. The leading elements of the 16th Infantry Brigade arrived on 17June and captured Kuneitra. The 23rd Infantry Brigade arrived on 28 June. The division then took part in the Battle of Damascus. The campaign ended on 14July and the division remained in Syria.|$|E
3000|$|Despite the microarchitectures’ {{effective}} {{exploitation of}} parallelism and bandwidth, there <b>are</b> two potential <b>concerns.</b> The first <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the depth of}} the memories results in a restriction on the quantity of bounding volumes and, therefore, on the quantity of objects.

5|$|Caliph Walid quickly re-confirmed Qutayba as governor, {{and even}} made his {{province}} independent {{from the governor}} of Iraq, but Qutayba's position was not secure: the Arab army was tired of constant campaigning and was still riven by factional rivalries, while Qutayba himself had alienated the most powerful Arab tribal groups. He was generally popular among the native Iranians, but {{the leader of the}} native auxiliaries, Hayyan an-Nabati, had secretly turned against him. Qutayba was completely unaware of the situation however, and began preparations for the campaign of 715, during which he intended to finally capture the Ferghana Valley and complete the subjugation of the Jaxartes valley. His only <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> his old rival, Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, might be restored to the Caliph's favour after al-Hajjaj's death, and he took few precautions except for removing his family and belongings from Merv to Shash and placing a guard on the Oxus.|$|E
5|$|During {{his initial}} {{research}} into cyberculture, Idol ordered Beyond Cyberpunk! from Gareth Branwyn. The HyperCard stack, which included collections of essays on cyberpunk culture, inspired Idol to include similar material within the Cyberpunk album {{as a special}} edition digipak feature. Discussing the matter with Branwyn, Idol received an initial bid {{for the job of}} producing the disk from the writer. While this bid was under consideration by Idol's management company, Idol had purchased a book-on-disk by Jaime Levy at a Los Angeles bookstore. At the time, Levy was the author and publisher of Electronic Hollywood, one of the first magazines produced on floppy disk. Impressed by its contents, Idol set about contacting her for the job of producing the disk. Successfully under-bidding Branwyn, she was then given the job and a master tape of recorded songs – which were not yet compiled into CD format – for use in sampling. Levy was given permission to include whatever content she desired. Meeting Idol to find what he was interested in presenting in the disk, his only <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the whole cyberpunk genre be represented as much as possible.|$|E
5|$|During {{the design}} process, {{it was decided}} that the utmost <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the ships could be built quickly and placed into service. The ships were to discard the use of {{broadside}} belt armor below the waterline, the attachment of which was an extremely long process. It was believed that the higher speed of the class——would make up for the vulnerability to torpedo attack and make the armor unnecessary.The initial designs called for three main battery turrets, each mounting a pair of new 42cm guns, though this was later increased to four twin turrets. However, the work that would have been necessary to design and test the new turret clashed with U-boat construction, which had become the priority of the Navy. Krupp, the firm that had been awarded the contract to conduct the testing, informed the Reichsmarineamt (RMA—the Imperial Navy Office) that design work on the new turret would have to wait. Capelle accepted the news without much objection. Nevertheless, the ships were never built. The RMA filed a report dated 1 February 1918, which stated that capital ship construction had ground to a halt, primarily due to the shifting priorities to the U-boat war.|$|E

5|$|Interest from {{military}} leaders for an airport at Banak returned in 1955. For {{the air force}} the main <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they could not reach the eastern-most parts of Norway from Bodø Main Air Station. This resulted in several Soviet infringements of Norwegian air space. Alternative locations were considered, such as Kautokeino, were there had been built a radar. NATO supported a reconstruction of Banak, partially raised by increased focus on flanking maneuver strategies, and also {{to serve as a}} part of the nuclear program. NATO was ready to provide funding in 1957, but by the Norwegian authorities wanted to delay its construction, citing lack of personnel to man the station and that it would not be usable in times of war. The government decided in 1957 to not allow nuclear warheads to be stored in Norway during peacetime, thus eliminating NATO's strategic need for Banak. The airport was therefore removed from the investment program.|$|E
5|$|The Klingons {{received}} {{the first major}} revision in design since their appearance in The Motion Picture. Dodie Shepard designed new red and black uniforms for Chancellor Gorkon and his staff, as it was judged {{that it would be}} unseemly for the chancellor to wear common warrior garb. Another <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> there was not enough of designer Robert Fletcher's The Motion Picture uniforms for all the Klingons in the film. While the important Klingons were given multi-layered prosthetics and unique head ridges, background characters wore ready-made masks, with minor touch-ups on the eyes and mouth. Since it was important for the actors' expressions to be visible through the makeup, the appliances were made thin using the latest glues and paints. Transforming an actor into a Klingon took three and a half hours. Hairstylist Jan Alexander designed braids and jewelry that suggested a tribal people with a long and treasured heritage.|$|E
5|$|The actors' union Equity had {{actively}} {{fought against}} the introduction of TV recording since the 1950s, when it first became a practical proposition. Before workable television recording was developed, if a broadcaster wished to repeat a programme (usually a one-off play), he had to re-hire the actors to perform it again, live, for additional fees. Equity's <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> if broadcasters kept recordings of the original performances, {{they would be able}} to re-broadcast them indefinitely, which would reduce the amount of new production and threaten the livelihoods of its members. Although Equity could not prevent recording altogether, it added standard clauses to its members' contracts that stipulated that recordings could only be repeated a limited number of times within a specific timeframe, and deliberately set the fees for further use so high that broadcasters would consider it unjustifiable to spend so much money repeating an old programme rather than making a new one. Consequently, recordings whose repeat rights had expired were considered to be of no further domestic use to the broadcasters.|$|E

25|$|Lee Myung-bak faced strong {{criticism}} {{over his}} choice of political appointees, {{many of whom were}} wealthy. The <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Lee's appointees would favor policies that protect the rich, while failing {{to address the needs of}} the underprivileged. Another criticism was that these appointees have mostly chosen from the nation's southeast region (Gyeongsangbuk-do and Gyeongsangnam-do), which is known as a GNP stronghold.|$|E
25|$|Activist {{groups had}} long {{expressed}} {{concern over the}} memberships of the People's Republic of China, Zimbabwe, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan, and the past memberships of Algeria, Syria, Libya, Uganda and Vietnam on the Commission. These countries had extensive records of human rights violations, and one <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> by working against resolutions on the commission condemning human rights violations, they indirectly promoted despotism and domestic repression.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} Can-Car's success in other markets, {{as early as}} 1981 the {{government}} had considered selling UTDC to the private sector. Their <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> without a manufacturing business, UTDC would {{find it difficult to}} make enough income to justify its Kingston operations. If the company did start a manufacturing side, it would be inappropriate for the company to remain government owned. The Can-Car deal put this on hold for a time.|$|E
25|$|Justice White {{went on to}} argue, {{on public}} policy grounds, that the Court's holding would {{negatively}} impact the justice system. His <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> prosecutors would cease to seek joint trials in cases of interlocking confessions, while judges would not admit codefendant's confessions as a prophylactic measure, even where no harmful error would likely result. This would overburden the state, inconvenience police and witnesses, cause delays in the trial system, and possibly lead to inconsistent verdicts, he continued.|$|E
25|$|NIS took in March 1990 {{initiative}} to centralize the local ship registers and jointly locate them with NIS. They emphasized that NIS operated an around-the-clock duty service. A joint {{location of the}} registers would allow for economies of scale, cutting costs. It would also allow time to be freed up at the magistrate offices and at the district courts. Another <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the recent rationalization program following the introduction of electronic registers had given little savings due to the decentralized nature of the operations.|$|E
