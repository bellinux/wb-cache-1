5|$|Bruce's {{new house}} was {{complete}} by 1699, and was worked on {{by many of}} the same <b>craftsmen</b> who were engaged by Bruce at nearby Hopetoun House, which was under construction at the same time. <b>Craftsmen</b> included the plasterers John McKay and Thomas Albur, cabinet maker William Scott, plumber Joseph Foster, smith Alexander Gardener, and the wright Andrew Barclay. The staircase, with its wrought-iron balustrade decorated with roses, thistles, tulips and oak leaves, bears many similarities to the one at Caroline Park, Granton, and was the work of the smiths James Storrie and James Horne.|$|E

5|$|Society in {{the urban}} {{settlements}} of the burghs was headed by wealthier merchants, who often held local office as a burgess, alderman, bailies, or {{as a member of}} the burgh council. Below them were <b>craftsmen</b> and workers that made up the majority of the urban population. Both merchants and <b>craftsmen</b> often served a long apprenticeship, acquiring skills and status, before they became freemen of a burgh, and could enjoy certain rights and privileges. Major sources of trade included the export of wool, fish, coal, salt and cattle. Imports included wine, sugar and other luxury goods. Important crafts included metal working, carpentry, leather working, pottery and later brewing and wig-making. There were frequent disputes between the burgesses and <b>craftsmen</b> over rights and political control of the burgh, occasionally bursting into violence, as occurred at Perth in the first half of the sixteenth century.|$|E
50|$|From 1995 to 2008, <b>Craftsman</b> {{sponsored}} the NASCAR <b>Craftsman</b> Truck Series, a deal {{which began with}} {{the inception of the}} Truck Series. After the 2008 season, <b>Craftsman</b> withdrew from sponsoring the series and was replaced by Camping World. In 2016, <b>Craftsman</b> returned to motorsports sponsorship, serving as the title name for the World of Outlaws, renaming the Sprint Car Series and Late Model Series to the World of Outlaws <b>Craftsman</b> Sprint Car Series and World of Outlaws <b>Craftsman</b> Late Model Series, respectively.|$|R

5|$|After the earthquake, Constantine Ypsilantis {{ordered the}} {{immediate}} restoration of Bucharest. To prevent masons and <b>craftsmen</b> from profiting from the disaster, he set maximum wages for their work.

5|$|Artisans and <b>craftsmen</b> {{during the}} Han had a {{socio-economic}} status between that of farmers and merchants. Yet some {{were able to}} obtain a valuable income, such as one craftsman who made knives and swords {{and was able to}} eat food fit for nobles and officials. Artisans and <b>craftsmen</b> also enjoyed a legal status that was superior to merchants. Unlike lowly merchants, artisans were allowed by law to wear fancy silks, ride on horseback, and ride in carriages. There were also no laws which barred artisans from becoming officials. An artisan painter who worked at the Imperial Academy turned down many offers to become nominated for public office. In contrast, a bureaucrat who appointed a merchant as an official could suffer impeachment from office, while some even avoided nominations by claiming they were merchants.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the high}} value placed on works of art, even famous artists were of low social status among the Greeks and Romans, who {{regarded}} artists, artisans, and <b>craftsmen</b> alike as manual labourers. At the same time, {{the level of}} skill required to produce quality work was recognized, and even considered a divine gift.|$|E

5000|$|Sears {{has never}} {{manufactured}} <b>Craftsman</b> products itself, instead relying on other manufacturers {{to make the}} products for them following Sears designs and specifications, and then applying the <b>Craftsman</b> brand name. Sometimes, the <b>Craftsman</b> branded items include exclusive features or functions that separate them from the manufacturer's own brand or other brands that that manufacturer produces. At other times, <b>Craftsman</b> products are identical to models of other brands with a different name on them.|$|R

5|$|In recent years, many {{traditional}} houses are being reconstructed and owners lured to come back, thus revitalizing tourism {{as a potential}} revenue source for the local economy.

5|$|Slaves {{were also}} used as <b>craftsmen</b> and tradespersons. As in agriculture, they were used for labour that was beyond the {{capability}} of the family. The slave population was greatest in workshops: the shield factory of Lysias employed 120 slaves, {{and the father of}} Demosthenes owned 32 cutlers and 20 bedmakers.|$|E
5|$|Stone keep {{construction}} required skilled <b>craftsmen.</b> Unlike {{timber and}} earthworks, {{which could be}} built using unfree labour or serfs, these <b>craftsmen</b> had to be paid and stone keeps were therefore expensive. They were also relatively slow to erect, due to {{the limitations of the}} lime mortar used during the period – a keep's walls could usually be raised by a maximum of only 12 feet (3.6 metres) a year; the keep at Scarborough was not atypical in taking ten years to build. The number of such keeps remained relatively low: in England, for example, although several early stone keeps had been built after the conquest, there were only somewhere between ten and fifteen in existence by 1100, and only around a hundred had been built by 1216.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the main}} house at <b>Craftsman</b> Farms was {{initially}} conceived of as a clubhouse for students, {{lack of interest in}} the school prompted Stickley to live there with his family instead. The planned school never became a reality. By 1913, changing tastes and the financial strain of his new twelve-story <b>Craftsman</b> Building in Manhattan, conceived as a department store, began to take their toll; in 1915 he filed for bankruptcy, stopping publication of The <b>Craftsman</b> in December 1916 and selling <b>Craftsman</b> Farms in 1917.|$|R

5|$|The Middle Ages brought {{advances}} in forge welding, in which blacksmiths pounded heated metal repeatedly until bonding occurred. In 1540, Vannoccio Biringuccio published De la pirotechnia, which includes {{descriptions of the}} forging operation. Renaissance <b>craftsmen</b> were skilled in the process, and the industry continued to grow during the following centuries.|$|E
5|$|The craft guilds {{required}} {{relatively stable}} markets and a relative equality {{of income and}} opportunity amongst their members to function effectively. By the 14th century these conditions were increasingly uncommon. The first strains were seen in London, where the old guild system began to collapse – more trade was being conducted at a national level, making it hard for <b>craftsmen</b> to both manufacture goods and trade in them, and there were growing disparities in incomes between the richer and poorer <b>craftsmen.</b> As a result, under EdwardIII many guilds became companies or livery companies, chartered companies focusing on trade and finance, leaving the guild structures to represent {{the interests of the}} smaller, poorer manufacturers.|$|E

5|$|Work {{began in}} 1954 on {{construction}} of the building to Glanz's plans, using Tehnika, a Ljubljana construction firm.

It was completed in 1959.|$|E

50|$|Based on the {{relatively}} crude depictions of Christ, Mary, and the saints, {{and the way}} the <b>craftsman</b> completed the work, scholars have concluded that the cross was made by an Eastern <b>craftsman</b> in a Western city. This could mean the <b>craftsman</b> was someone from the East who moved West during iconoclasm, or perhaps someone who had studied under an Eastern <b>craftsman</b> before practising their trade in the West. It is presumed that the cross was made in a much more isolated location than other crosses from the same time period. It has some stylistic similarities to the reliquary box known as the Fieschi Morgan Staurotheke, but is even more crude.|$|R
