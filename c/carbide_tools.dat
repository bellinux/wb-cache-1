50|$|To {{increase}} {{the life of}} <b>carbide</b> <b>tools,</b> they are sometimes coated. Four such coatings are TiN (titanium nitride), TiC (titanium carbide), Ti(C)N (titanium carbide-nitride), and TiAlN (titanium aluminum nitride). (Newer coatings, known as DLC (Diamond-like carbon) are beginning to surface, enabling the cutting power of diamond without the unwanted chemical reaction between real diamond and iron.)

A coating allows {{the cutting edge of}} a tool to cleanly pass through the material without having the material gall (stick) to it. The coating also helps to decrease the temperature associated with the cutting process and {{increase the}} life of the tool.
