5|$|During his {{association}} with the Duo-Art company between 1915 and 1932, Grainger made around 80 piano rolls {{of his own and}} others' music using a wooden robot designed to play a <b>concert</b> <b>grand</b> piano via an array of precision mechanical fingers and feet; replayings of many of these rolls have subsequently been recorded on to compact disc. This reproduction system allowed Grainger to make a posthumous appearance in the Albert Hall, London, during the 1988 last night of the Proms as soloist with the BBC Symphony Orchestra in Grieg's Piano Concerto.|$|E

The two traded playing each other's compositions, as well as pieces by other composers such as Béla Bartók.|$|E
5000|$|In small pianos the inharmonicity is {{so extreme}} that {{establishing}} a stretch {{based on a}} triple octave makes the single octaves beat noticeably, and the wide, fast beating intervals in the upper treble—especially major 17ths—beat wildly. Of a necessity the tuner will attempt to limit the stretch. In large pianos like <b>concert</b> <b>grands,</b> less inharmonicity allows a complete string stretch without negatively affecting close octaves and other intervals. So {{while it may be}} true that the smaller piano receives a greater stretch relative to the fundamental pitch, only the <b>concert</b> <b>grand's</b> octaves can be fully widened so that triple octaves are beatless. This contributes to the response, brilliance and [...] "singing" [...] quality that <b>concert</b> <b>grands</b> offer.|$|R

The studios are modernized with computers, synthesizers, and various recording equipment. The center houses {{the departments of}} Art and Music, and was given to Bates by the F. W.

The Olin Arts Center has joined with the Maine Music Society, to produces musical performances throughout Maine. In 2007, they hosted an event that garnered 260 musicians music recital inspired by Johannes Brahms.|$|E
25|$|During the Brain Salad Surgery tour of 1974, Emerson's {{keyboard}} setup {{included the}} Hammond C-3 organ, run through multiple Leslie speakers driven by HiWatt guitar amplifiers, the Moog 3C modular synthesiser (modified by addition of various modules and an oscilloscope) with ribbon controller, a Steinway <b>concert</b> <b>grand</b> piano with a Minimoog synthesiser {{on top of}} it, an upright acoustic-electric piano that was used for honky-tonk piano sounds, a Hohner Clavinet and another Minimoog synthesiser. Emerson also used a prototype polyphonic synthesiser produced by Moog, which was the test bed for the Moog Polymoog polyphonic synthesiser. The original synthesiser setup as envisioned by Moog was called the Constellation, and consisted of three instruments – the polyphonic synthesiser, called the Apollo, a monophonic lead synthesiser called the Lyra, and a bass-pedal synthesiser, called the Taurus, but Emerson never used the Taurus.|$|E
25|$|Wolverine's healing factor {{also affects}} {{a number of}} his {{physical}} attributes by increasing them to superhuman levels. His stamina is sufficiently heightened to the point he can exert himself for numerous hours, even after exposure to powerful tranquilizers. Wolverine's agility and reflexes are also enhanced to levels that are beyond the physical limits of the finest human athlete. Due to his healing factor's constant regenerative qualities, he can push his muscles beyond the limits of the human body without injury. This, coupled by the constant demand placed on his muscles by over one hundred pounds of adamantium, grants him some degree of superhuman strength. Since the presence of the adamantium negates the natural structural limits of his bones, he can lift or move weight that would otherwise damage a human skeleton. He has been depicted breaking steel chains, lifting several men above his head with one arm and throwing them through a wall, lifting Ursa Major (in grizzly bear form) over his head before tossing him across a room, and hauling a <b>concert</b> <b>grand</b> piano, and the platform it rests on, via a harness, while climbing a sheer cliff. Colossus and other allies use Wolverine's endurance and strength when throwing him at high speed in the Fastball Special.|$|E
5000|$|Explanation of {{the term}} Studio Grand: A tall upright piano - 50 inches or taller, one that a person of average height can't see over when seated at the bench - is {{sometimes}} referred to as an [...] "upright grand". Straube branded it as a [...] "Cabinet Grand". Use of the word [...] "grand" [...] with uprights {{should not be confused with}} <b>concert</b> <b>grands.</b> Upright grands can be of high quality and - short of <b>concert</b> <b>grands</b> - are often the choice of serious pianists, recording studios, and performance venues. A mid-high upright - one that one can barely see over - is often used in dance studios, where an accompanist can see the dancers. A short upright, one that rises less than a foot above the keyboard, is referred to as a spinet. Serious pianists typically regard spinets as inadequate because the soundboard is too short to produce a full sound with full overtones.|$|R

500|$|Mercury {{played the}} piano in many of Queen's most popular songs, {{including}} [...] "Killer Queen", [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody", [...] "Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy", [...] "We Are the Champions", [...] "Somebody To Love" [...] and [...] "Don't Stop Me Now". He used <b>concert</b> <b>grand</b> pianos and, occasionally, other keyboard instruments such as the harpsichord. From 1980 onward, he also made frequent use of synthesisers in the studio. Queen guitarist Brian May claims that Mercury was unimpressed with his own abilities at the piano and used the instrument less over time {{because he wanted to}} walk around onstage and entertain the audience. Although he wrote many lines for the guitar, Mercury possessed only rudimentary skills on the instrument. Songs like [...] "Ogre Battle" [...] and [...] "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" [...] were composed on the guitar; the latter featured Mercury playing rhythm guitar on stage and in the studio.|$|E

2500|$|... "Black And White Rag" [...] {{started a}} craze for her honky-tonk style of playing.

2500|$|Atwell's husband, former stage comedian Lew Levisohn, {{was vital}} in shaping {{her career as}} a variety star. The two had met in 1946, and married soon after. They were inseparable up to Levisohn's death in Hong Kong in December 1977; they had no children. He had cannily made the choice, for stage purposes, of her playing first a <b>concert</b> <b>grand,</b> then a beaten-up old upright piano. The latter was {{purchased}} from a Battersea junk shop for 50 shillings. This became famous as [...] "my other piano". It would later feature all over the world, from Las Vegas to the Sydney Opera House, travelling over half a million miles by air throughout Atwell's concert career.

2500|$|Many of Rachmaninoff's {{recordings}} are acknowledged classics. In 1919, Rachmaninoff {{recorded a}} selection of piano pieces for Edison Records on their [...] "Diamond Disc" [...] records, as they claimed the best audio fidelity in piano recording. Thomas Edison, who was quite deaf, did not care for Rachmaninoff's playing, or for classical music in general, and referred {{to him as a}} [...] "pounder" [...] at their initial meeting. However, staff at the Edison recording studio in New York City asked Edison to reconsider his dismissive position, resulting in a limited contract for ten released sides. Rachmaninoff recorded on a Lauter <b>concert</b> <b>grand</b> piano, one of the few the company made. He felt his performances varied in quality and requested final approval prior to a commercial release. Edison agreed, but still issued multiple takes, an unusual practice which was standard at Edison Records, where strict company policy demanded three good takes of each piece in case of damage or wear to the masters. Rachmaninoff and Edison Records were pleased with the released discs and wished to record more, but Edison refused, saying the ten sides were sufficient.|$|E
