In order to overcome these limits, and to improve the practical usage, this study is aimed to develop a stable zinc <b>crystalline</b> <b>glaze.</b> This study altered the quantity of nuclear formation of zinc crystal glaze {{in order to control}} the willemite (Zn 2 SiO 4) formation in the glaze. The addition of ZrO 2 to zinc crystal glaze influences the quantity of nuclear formation and its preservation; thus ZrO 2 was used to control the optimal firing temperature {{and the size of the}} crystal formation in the glaze to find a zinc crystal glaze capable of withstanding various ranges of temperatures...|$|E

Alexander, a fifth generation potter, had founded Chelsea Keramic Art Works (Chelsea, Massachusetts) in 1866 (or 1867), its successor, Dedham Pottery (Dedham, Massachusetts) in 1896, and the Roblin Art Pottery (San Francisco) in 1898. Fred worked at Chelsea and then Dedham. Other Robertson family members worked at Chelsea and Dedham, including Alexander's brother, Hugh. Dedham {{is known for its}} crackle (craquelure) and volcanic glazes, and blue cobalt hand painted designs. [...] In 1903 Fred moved to California and joined Alexander at Roblin. The name Roblin came from the names of its founders, Robertson and Linna Irelan. Fred moved to Los Angeles in 1906 and worked for LA Pressed Brick until 1921 as its superintendent.

40|$|This study {{looked at}} the effects of {{colorant}} oxides and firing rate on the nucleation and growth of crystals in zinc-based crystalline glazes. One weight percent of iron and copper oxide powders were mixed separately with a zinc-based <b>crystalline</b> <b>glaze.</b> The uncolored glaze along with both colored glazes were applied to test tiles and fired. Two different firing schedules were used with different ramp up firing rates of 165 °C/hr (slow) and 205 °C/hr (fast). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis found both zinc oxide and silica oxide in the raw glaze, which are the main components {{in the formation of}} zinc silicate. XRD analysis of the fired glaze found zinc silicate, the main component of the crystals. XRD analysis was unable to pick up traces of either the copper or iron oxide. X-ray florescence was used to check for oxide concentration in the glaze. 0. 59 % Cu was found in the copper oxide glaze while 0. 92 % Fe was found in the iron oxide glaze. The number of nuclei were counted using the assistance of computer software. The size of the crystals was calculated using the intercept method to get a grain size value for the crystals. The addition of copper oxide and iron oxide decreased the number of nuclei by an average of 60. 2 % and 84. 0 % respectively. It also reduced the grain size number of the crystals by 35. 5 % for the copper and 38. 5 % for the iron. The change from the slower firing rate to the faster firing rate decreased the number of crystals in the uncolored glaze by 43. 8 % and decreased the average number of crystals in the copper oxide and iron oxide glazes by 76. 1 % and 61. 0 % respectively. The crystal sizes were also reduced by 22. 8 % for the copper, 27. 0 % for the iron and 18. 8 % for the uncolored glaze on average. The results of this study showed that the addition of colorant oxides or increasing the ramp up rate produced less crystals which were larger in size...|$|E

Ca(CrxTi 1 −x) O 3 compositions obtained without addition of NH 4 Cl as mineralizer, produce pink color in glazes at low x but CaCrO 4 crystallizes when x increases, producing undesired green colors. The crystallization of chromates can be avoided using NH 4 Cl as mineralizer, giving a complete solid solution that produce pink color in glazes at low x and dark blue shades at high x. Coprecipitated sample produce blue colors at low x and at low temperature than ceramic sample (1000 °C instead 1200 °C for CE sample). Cr 4 + ion acts as red chromophore, but at higher x values (blue samples) Cr 3 + ion entrance affects the color. Ca(FexTi 1 −x) O 3 system crystallizes perovskite CaTiO 3 and pseudobrookite Fe 2 TiO 5 together with rutile as residual <b>crystalline</b> phase, <b>glazed</b> samples change from a yellow to a pink color associated to the increase of pseudobrookite with firing temperature. Ca(FexTi 1 −x) O 3 and Ca(CrxZr 1 −x) O 3 systems crystallize perovskite CaZrO 3 and zirconia (ZrO 2) in both monoclinic and cubic polymorphs, but iron or chromium oxides are not detected in the powders.

Ceramic frits were melted at different temperatures with subsequent cooling in water. Samples were characterized by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetry (DTA, TG) and by heating microscopy. Finally, frits were applied as glazes on ceramic tiles to evaluate their capacity to adapt to the tile productive process. The frits showed low to high homogeneity (depending on the fusion temperature) and oxidation phenomena. High temperature fusion led to the crystallization of magnetite during cooling.
