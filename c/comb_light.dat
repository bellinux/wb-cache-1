We show that strong polariton-polariton inter- action generates complex dynamics in the weak-lasing domain way beyond Hopf bifurcations. As a result, the exciton-polariton condensates exhibit self-induced oscillations and emit an equidistant frequency <b>comb</b> <b>light</b> spectrum. A plethora of possible emission spectra with asymmetric peak dis- tributions appears due to spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry.

40|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} {{spectacular}} current applications of nonlinear integrated optics, a field which was pioneered by George Stegeman more than thirty years ago [1], is that of nonlinear microresonator based optical frequency <b>comb</b> <b>light</b> sources. Optical frequency comb sources are characterized by a spectrum comprising many equally spaced components [2], and have a wide range of scientific and technological applications. Although commercial comb generators are based on mode-locked lasers and fiber supercontinuum generation, nonlinear integrated optics provides a low-cost and chip-scale alternative, based on a low-power cw laser coupled into a high-Q microresonator [3]. So far microresonator frequency combs have exploited the third order “Kerr” nonlinearity, which permits to generate successive comb lines with a spacing equal to the resonator free-spectral range via cascaded four-wave mixing [4 - 5]. Modeling of microresonator frequency combs can be greatly simplified by a single partial differential equation approach [4 - 6], analogous to the case of other coherently driven Kerr spatially diffractive [7] or temporally dispersive [8 - 9] nonlinear cavities. In order to lower the threshold power and extend the spectral range of frequency comb generation, for example into the visible or mid-infrared, while still using near-infrared cw laser pumps, quadratic nonlinear cavities can be exploited [10]. These quadratic microresonator frequency comb sources operate close to the phase-matching condition for the underlying quadratic processes, and not in the cascading regime that reduces the dynamics to the Kerr case [11]. Quite remarkably, a single time domain partial differential equation with an effective delayed third-order nonlinearity was derived to describe with excellent accuracy the dynamics of quadratic frequency comb generation [12 - 13]. In situations where multiple processes are present, and the frequency combs generated around the interacting waves over multiple octaves overlap, we carried out numerical modeling based on a single envelope equation approach [14].

5|$|The company's {{financial}} difficulties after 1866 had precluded the purchasing of any more locomotives until six 4-4-0 locomotives {{were built in}} 1876 by Neilson's, partly to replace the Deeside locomotives. These had larger boilers and fireboxes than previous locomotives and {{were the first to}} be built with cabs. The next twelve locomotives had rounded splashers over the trailing driving wheels, meaning the shape of the cab was different, but retained the brass dome on the firebox, copper capped chimney and had brass bands joining the firebox and boiler. After James Manson became locomotive superintendent in 1883 he introduced a more contemporary design of locomotive, with inside cylinders and doors on the side of cabs and without brass domes or copper chimneys. The first six were built by Kitson & Co in Leeds in 1884, followed by three similar but lighter in 1885.

Extending their spectral range to the visible is generally hindered by strong normal material dispersion and scattering losses. In this paper, we report the first realization of a green-light frequency comb in integrated high-Q silicon nitride (SiN) ring microresonators. Third-order optical non-linearities are utilized to convert a near-infrared Kerr frequency comb to a broadband green <b>light</b> <b>comb.</b> The 1 -THz frequency spacing infrared comb covers up to 2 / 3 of an octave, from 144 to 226 THz (or 1327 - 2082 nm), and the simultaneously generated green-light comb is centered around 570 - 580 THz (or 517 - 526 nm), with comb lines emitted down to 517 THz (or 580 nm) and up to 597 THz (or 502 nm). The green comb power is estimated to be as high as - 9. 1 dBm in the bus waveguide, with an on-chip conversion efficiency of - 34 dB. The proposed approach substantiates the feasibility of on-chip optical frequency comb generation expanding to the green spectral region or even shorter wavelengths...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of table olive showed in Sardinia {{an increase of}} production {{in line with the}} national production (+ 17. 3 %) unfortunately the low mechanization level penalizes the sector strongly. Problems which priority have to be faced are bound to the damage induced by the work organs and especially the material which they are coated with from their conformation. The study has the aim of evaluating the mechanical damage produced by a hand harvester modified for the harvest of olives by the plant. The hand harvester is constituted from a narrow and <b>light</b> <b>comb</b> with 11 teeth in titanium with 4 mm diameter and coated by a sheath in silicone of the thickness of 1 mm for the experimentation the silicone covering was removed, some theet coated with vulcanized rubber of the thickness of 3 mm, 10 mm and 15 mm were produced and various rotation speeds were tested (200, 300 and 400 RPM). The number of turns was determined by the mechanical revolution counter (DEUMO 2) making one of the two electrical units of measurement change (v, to A). The damage produced by modified teeth on olives was ranging from a minimum of 4. 2 % with speed of 200 RPM. and a protection of 15 mm to a maximum of 21. 3 % with 400 RPM speed and protection teeth of 15 mm...|$|R
40|$|Broadband (multiline frequency) <b>light</b> <b>combs</b> {{present a}} wealth of applications, ranging from meteorology, sensing and {{measurements}} to those potentially {{in the domain of}} attosecond science. We report here on detailed investigations of, what we believe is, a novel Raman self-synchronous process that is accompanied by extreme enhancement of the bandwidth of the generated light frequencies. Over the last decade, there have been several reports of cavity contexts where efficient broadband multiline generation is possible. These contexts include spherical micro-cavities [1], monolithic microresonators [2] and so-called ‘bottle microresonators’ [3], in which the cavity quality to mode volume ratio (Q / V) plays a dominant role in the characteristics of the device and its constituent whispering gallery modes. Typically, maximum quality and low volume lead to the optimal condition of high Q / V. To illustrate distinctiveness from these well-known contexts, we highlight where bandwidth generation has local optimisation in either: low-Q resonators (with very moderate reflectivities), or; larger volume cavities (e. g. with longer cavity lengths). For example, such cavity-enhanced bandwidth regimes may result in 100 's of generated frequencies; maximum bandwidths of only up to 30 to 50 frequencies arise in the corresponding non-cavity contexts. We will summarise results from an exhaustive exploration of this new effect (in terms of cavity parameters) and compare these results with semi-analytical models that we have developed to lend insight into the origins of this bandwidth enhancement and its correspondence with self-synchronisation...|$|R
40|$|The on-chip {{generation}} of large and complex optical quantum states will enable low-cost and accessible advances for quantum technologies, such as secure communications and quantum computation. Integrated frequency <b>combs</b> are on-chip <b>light</b> sources {{with a broad}} spectrum of evenly-spaced frequency modes, commonly generated by four-wave mixing in optically-excited nonlinear micro-cavities, whose recent use for quantum state generation has provided a solution for scalable and multi-mode quantum light sources. Pulsed quantum frequency combs are of particular interest, since they allow the {{generation of}} single-frequency-mode photons, required for scaling state complexity towards, e. g., multi-photon states, and for quantum information applications. However, generation schemes for such pulsed combs have, to date, relied on micro-cavity excitation via lasers external to the sources, being neither versatile nor power-efficient, and impractical for scalable realizations of quantum technologies. Here, we introduce an actively-modulated, nested-cavity configuration that exploits the resonance pass-band characteristic of the micro-cavity to enable a mode-locked and energy-efficient excitation. We demonstrate that the scheme allows the generation of high-purity photons at large coincidence-to-accidental ratios (CAR). Furthermore, by increasing the repetition rate of the excitation field via harmonic mode-locking (i. e. driving the cavity modulation at harmonics of the fundamental repetition rate), we managed to increase the pair production rates (i. e. source efficiency), while maintaining a high CAR and photon purity. Our approach represents a significant step towards the realization of fully on-chip, stable, and versatile sources of pulsed quantum frequency combs, crucial for the development of accessible quantum technologies. © 2017 Optical Society of America. </p...|$|R
