40|$|This essay {{proposes a}} new theory of agentive modals: ability modals and their duals, {{compulsion}} modals. After criticizing existing approaches—the existential quantificational analysis, the universal quantificational analysis, and the conditional analysis—it presents a new account that builds on both the existential and conditional analyses. On this account, the act <b>conditional</b> <b>analysis,</b> a sentence like ‘John can swim across the river’ says {{that there is some}} practically available action that is such that if John tries to do it, he swims across the river. The essay argues that the act <b>conditional</b> <b>analysis</b> avoids the problems faced by existing accounts of agentive modality and shows how the act <b>conditional</b> <b>analysis</b> can be extended to an account of generic agentive modal claims. The upshot is a new vantage point on the role of agentive modal ascriptions in practical discourse: ability ascriptions serve as a kind of hypothetical guarantee, and compulsion ascriptions as a kind of nonhypothetical guarantee...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Globally {{intermittent}} turbulence {{is characterized}} by sudden switching from significant turbulence to weak turbulence and back on time scales ranging from seconds to tens of minutes as opposed to microscale intermittency, {{which is due to}} organization of small scale gradients by individual eddies on scales as small as the Kolmogorov microscale. This thesis examines globally intermittent turbulent atmospheric data by a <b>conditional</b> <b>analysis</b> technique. The <b>conditional</b> <b>analysis</b> separates the stronger turbulence sections of data from the weak sections and analyzes each type separately. This analysis is applied to two different sources of global intermittency. One case arises from the undulating structure of the top of a convective internal boundary layer that was forming due to a cool marine boundary layer being modified by a sun-heated beach. The other case is nocturnal boundary layer intermittency, the causes of which are not well known. When applied {{to the top of the}} convective internal boundary layer, the <b>conditional</b> <b>analysis</b> performs well in that a turbulent kinetic energy budget can be balanced. Conventional analysis of the same data is unsatisfactory. The <b>conditional</b> <b>analysis</b> improves the behavior of relationships for nocturnal intermittency, especially in that it reduces non-stationarity, but it does not explain all the scatter in the data. This may be due to the large role of self-correlation in the traditional presentation of the data...|$|E
40|$|The {{value of}} inter-comparisons can {{be limited by}} the {{difficulty}} of auditing model differences back to the processes that caused them. <b>Conditional</b> <b>analysis</b> methods {{can be used to}} improve this auditability. Another recent improvement is the development of a ‘hybrid’ model that facilitates more rapid inter-comparisons between ADMS and AERMOD. An example of using <b>conditional</b> <b>analysis</b> to compare models is given for a tall stack with receptors in the near- and far-field. Differences between the models are related to different predictions of boundary-layer height; these predictions are compared using a ‘Dispersion Calendar’ that shows how height differences vary for different dispersion conditions...|$|E

40|$|Identification and {{detection}} of dendritic spines in neuron images are of high interest in {{diagnosis and treatment}} of neurological and psychiatric disorders (e. g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s diseases, and autism). In this paper, we have proposed a novel automatic approach using wavelet-based <b>conditional</b> symmetric <b>analysis</b> and regularized morphological shared-weight neural networks (RMSNN) for dendritic spine identification involving the following steps: backbone extraction, localization of dendritic spines, and classification. First, a new algorithm based on wavelet transform and <b>conditional</b> symmetric <b>analysis</b> has been developed to extract backbone and locate the dendrite boundary. Then, the RMSNN has been proposed to classify the spines into three predefined categories (mushroom, thin, and stubby). We have compared our proposed approach against the existing methods. The experimental result demonstrates that the proposed approach can accurately locate the dendrite and accurately classify the spines into three categories with the accuracy of 99. 1 % for “mushroom” spines, 97. 6 % for “stubby” spines, and 98. 6 % for “thin” spines...|$|R

40|$|The <b>conditional</b> <b>analysis</b> {{of ability}} faces {{familiar}} counterexamples involving cases of volitional incapacity.

We argue that this error-theoretic response fails. Either it succeeds in solving the problem of volitional incapacity at the cost of making the <b>conditional</b> <b>analysis</b> vulnerable to obvious counterexamples to its necessity. Or, it avoids the counterexamples to its necessity but fails {{to solve the problem of}} volitional incapacity...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{identifies}} an overdetermination problem {{faced by}} the non-reductive dispositional property account of disposition ascriptions. Two possible responses to the problem are evaluated and both are shown to have serious drawbacks.

During the last decade there has been an ongoing debate between proponents of the <b>conditional</b> <b>analysis</b> and proponents of the non-reductive dispositional property account of disposition ascriptions. 1 In this paper I shall point out a problem afflicting the non-reductive dispositional property account, a problem which has not been noted in the debate. I believe that philosophers who reject the <b>conditional</b> <b>analysis</b> and who adopt the non-reductive dispositional property account of disposition ascriptions would state the truth condition for a typical disposition ascription such as “sugar is water-soluble ” roughly as follows: “sugar is water-soluble ” is true iff sugar has a dispositional property such that it would cause sugar to dissolve if it were put in water (in ideal conditions) ...|$|E

40|$|The genetic {{relationships}} between amylose content (AC) and appearance quality traits of indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) were investigated using <b>conditional</b> <b>analysis</b> and unconditional analysis in present experiment. The {{results from the}} unconditional analysis indicated that AC of rice positively correlated with brown rice (BR, i. e., dehulled but unmilled rice) length (BRL), width (BRW) and thickness (BRT), but was negatively correlated with the ratio of length to width (RLW).

The control problem can be read as the optimization of a coupled forward backward system in finite discrete time on a set of state-dependent control processes. The existence is proved under sequential semi-continuity and the concepts of $L^ 0 $-compactness and $L^ 0 $-outer semicontinuity. We provide a set of conditions and show that they imply the latter concepts, and thus existence, when no constraints on the control sets are assumed...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{multiple}} eQTL (expression {{quantitative trait}} loci) catalogs have become available {{that can help}} understand the functionality of complex trait-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In eQTL catalogs, gene expression is often strongly associated with multiple SNPs, which may reflect either one or multiple independent associations. <b>Conditional</b> eQTL <b>analysis</b> allows a distinction between dependent and independent eQTLs.

The number of GWAS catalog SNPs identified as eQTL in the conditional analyses increases with 24 % as compared to unconditional analyses.

There are several studies where CDA was used to model energy consumption at the regional level; however the CDA method had not been used to model residential energy consumption at the national level. The prediction performance {{and the ability to}} characterize the residential end-use energy consumption of the CDA model are compared with those of a neural network (NN) and an engineering based model developed earlier. The comparison of the predictions of the models indicates that CDA is capable of accurately predicting the energy consumption in the residential sector {{as well as the other}} two models. The effects of socio-economic factors are estimated using the NN and the CDA models, where possible. Due to the limited number of variables the CDA model can accommodate, its capability to evaluate these effects is found to be lower than the NN model.
