40|$|A Be- 9 -solution {{has been}} {{chemically}} prepared from phenakite (Be 2 SiO 4) mineral grains as commercial Be- 9 -solutions {{are too high}} in long-lived Be- 10. The solution {{is intended to be}} used as a carrier for radiochemical separation of Be- 10 to be measured by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). Thus, accurate data of the Be- 9 -concentration of this solution is essential to guarantee for high-accuracy Be- 10 data in the future. After devastating preliminary results (similar to 8 % standard deviation), eight laboratories finally produced twelve individual results by four different analytical methods. A certain lab and method bias might be identified by sophisticated statistical evaluation. Some laboratories also (grossly) underestimate their uncertainties. Thus, the simple weighted mean of this <b>round-robin</b> <b>exercise</b> needed to be corrected by introducing additional allowances (Paule-Mandel-approach). The final result has been calculated to (2, 246 +/- A 11) mu g Be- 9 /(g solution) with a reasonably low weighted standard deviation of 0. 49 %. The maximum deviation of a single lab value from the weighted mean is 2. 4 % when removing one Grubbs outlier (11 % off from the mean) from the data set. As Be- 10 -data, which is usually calculated from measured Be- 10 /Be- 9 by AMS and stable Be- 9, cannot be more accurate than the determined Be- 9 -concentration, it seems highly advisable to establish or improve quality assurance by having self-made carrier-solutions analysed at more than a single lab and regularly taking part in <b>round-robin</b> <b>exercises...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Tritium {{occurs in}} {{environmental}} samples in 3 forms: (i) {{as part of}} free water (TFWT-tissue-free water tritium), or associated with organic matter in 2 ways, either (ii) bound to oxygen and/or nitrogen atoms of the material as exchangeable organically bound tritium (E-OBT) or (iii) bound to carbon atoms as non-exchangeable OBT (NE-OBT). Analyzing these OBT forms is rather complicated, and several problems have been encountered in developing robust and reproducible ana-lytical procedures, especially for low-level tritium activity. Nevertheless, OBT is nowadays a subject of increasing impor-tance, and the enhancement of determination capabilities is therefore desirable.

40|$|Foams (CAN/ULC-S 770) {{are based}} on {{accelerating}} the foam aging process by slicing the foam into thin specimens. This accelerates the diffusion process so that thermal conductivity for foam insulation of varying thickness can be determined {{in a short period}} of time, typically less than one year. The C 1303 process calls for a series of measurements to define a relationship between thermal conductivity and a scaled aging time which is then analyzed to calculate the time-average thermal conductivity over any given service life. The S 770 process also uses scaled aging time, but uses the projected thermal conductivity at precisely five years of age to represent the insulation's useful service value. There is also a difference in how the thermal results are reported. The S 770 protocol calls for very careful determination of the initial thermal resistivity of a full thickness board, to which an aging factor is applied to determine the five-year value. The C 1303 protocol calls for reporting both the average thermal resistance for the selected thickness and service life and the aging curve data from the thin specimens.

This scientific roadmap identifies user needs, summarizes {{the current state of the}} art, and pinpoints major gaps in long-term objectives to deliver space-derived phytoplankton diversity data that meets the user requirements.

Appropriate phenomenological cure kinetics models were built to predict the degree of cure {{as a function of}} temperature/time profile.

The cure modelling methodology was validated against an international <b>Round-Robin</b> <b>exercise</b> led by the University of British Columbia (Canada). The effects of carbon nanoparticle incorporation on the cure kinetics and the glass transition temperature advancement of two of the epoxy systems were also studied. Cure kinetics models were developed for the nanocomposites containing commercial multiwalled carbon nanotubes and a direct comparison was made with the models of the neat resin systems. The glass transition temperature advancement is shown to be affected in the early stages of the cure. The state of the dispersion of the nanoparticles was studied in order to correlate it with the observed effects upon the cure and on the morphology of the cured samples. The presence of carbon nanotube clusters is shown to have an influence on the phase separation in the MTM 44 - 1 resin system. As a potential industrial application of this study, optical fibre refractometers were utilised as an on-line cure monitoring technique.

The performed calculations are {{the first part of}} a mini round robin exercise within the FP 7 project MULTIMETAL, whose main goals are the development of a standard for fracture resistance testing for multi-metallic specimen and the development of harmonized procedures for the integrity assessment of dissimilar metal welds (DMWs) as they appear in primary piping systems of light water reactors (LWRs). Within the <b>round-robin</b> <b>exercise</b> the project partners have to perform numerical Jintegral analyses on multi-metalic specimen that are extracted from different mock-ups containing DMWs. In a preliminary step each participating organization has to perform numerical J-integral calculations on fictitious homogeneous specimens, which are assumed to be entirely made of Inconel 52. The numerical results of the preliminary step are compared to analytical solutions taken from literature. The numerical results presented in this paper are the preliminary step results of JRC. For the CT specimens analytical and numerical J-integral solutions are in perfect agreement, where as for the SENB and the SENT specimens analytical and numerical J-integral values only agree for loads up to approximately 60 % and 50 % respectively of the corresponding limit loads. For higher loads analytical and numerical J-integral values deviate and the deviation reaches around 30 % at the limit loads of the two specimens, which requires an in-depth study of the theory behind the analytical solutions for SENB and SENT specimen.

The {{purpose of the}} round robins is to assess the current reliability of SG tubing inservice inspection, determine the probability of detection (POD) as function of flaw size or severity, and assess the capability for sizing of flaws. The mock-up contains hundreds of cracks and simulations of artifacts such as corrosion deposits and tube support plates that make detection and characterization of cracks more difficult in operating steam generators than in most laboratory situations. Eddy current signals from the laboratory-grown cracks used in the mock-up have been reviewed {{to ensure that they}} provide reasonable simulations of those obtained in the field. The mock-up contains 400 tube openings. Each tube contains nine 22. 2 -mm (7 / 8 -in.) diameter, 30. 5 -cm (1 -ft) long, Alloy 600 test sections. The flaws are located in the tube sheet near the roll transition zone (RTZ), in the tube support plate (TSP), and in the freespan. The flaws are primarily intergranular stress corrosion cracks (axial and circumferential, ID and OD). In addition to the simulated tube sheet and TSP the mock-up has simulated sludge and magnetite deposits. A validated multiparameter eddy current algorithm that provided a detailed isometric plot for every flaw was used to establish the reference state of defects in the mock-up.

Petrographic analysis of the organic matter was completed using both a prescribed classification and the individual classification normally used by each participant. Total organic carbon (TOC), Rock-Eval pyrolysis and elemental analysis were also completed for each sample. Significant differences exist in the petrographic results from both the prescribed and individual classifications. Although there is general agreement about the oil- vs gas-prone nature of the samples, comparison of results from individual classifications is difficult due to the variety of nomenclature and methods used to describe an organic matter assemblage. Results from the photomicrograph exercise document that different terminology is being used to describe the same component. Although variation in TOC and Rock-Eval data exists, geochemical results define kerogen type and generative potential. Recommendations from this study include: (1) A uniform organic matter classification must be employed, which eliminates complex terminology and is capable of direct correlation with geochemical parameters. (2) A standardized definition and nomenclature must be used for the unstructured (amorphous) organic matter category.
