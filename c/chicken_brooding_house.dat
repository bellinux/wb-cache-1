40|$|Two pen {{trials and}} 2 field trials were {{conducted}} {{to determine whether a}} direct-fed microbial (DFM; Primalac) was effective in improving turkey productive performance. In the pen trials, typical turkey diets were formulated with and without Primalac. All feed was provided by a commercial feed mill. In trial 1, Large White male turkey poults were placed in 48 pens (18 birds/pen, 24 pens/treatment) on the day of hatch and were reared to 20 wk. In trial 2, Large White female turkey poults were placed in 48 pens (30 birds/pen, 24 pens/treatment) on the day of hatch and were reared to 18 wk. Cumulative FCR was significantly improved for birds fed DFM feed compared with birds fed control feed at 20 wk in trial 1 and at 8 wk in trial 2. Body weight was significantly greater for birds fed DFM feed compared with birds fed the control feed through 12 wk in both trials. In 2 field trials, 2 <b>brooder</b> <b>houses</b> and 4 grow-out houses were paired on each farm (4 <b>brooder</b> <b>houses</b> and 8 grow-out houses total). All birds received the same feed provided by the integrator. The DFM was provided in the water from placement to market in 1 <b>brooder</b> <b>house</b> and in the 2 matching grow-out houses. Breeder flocks were equally represented in both <b>brooder</b> <b>houses</b> within each trial. Approximately 12, 000 male poults were placed in each <b>brooder</b> <b>house</b> and were transferred to 2 grow-out houses at 5 wk. Although no statistical analyses were computed for the field trials, there was a nominal improvement in performance associated with the DFM: mean livability was increased by 3. 5 %, mean BW was increased by 0. 9 kg (2 lb), mean total weight removed from the farms was increased by 13, 706 kg (30, 153 lb), mean FCR was improved by 0. 165, and cost of production was reduced by $ 0. 0195 /kg ($ 0. 043 /lb) of BW by the DFM. In conclusion, the DFM product (Primalac) used in these studies was effective in improving turkey live performance...|$|R

40|$|In 3 {{separate}} commercial turkey <b>brooder</b> <b>houses,</b> {{we compared}} the effects of selected probiotic bacteria or antibiotics on performance of poults within a complex that was routinely experiencing mild idiopathic diarrhea and stunting. In all experiments, treatments of probiotic cultures or antibiotics were administered in the water. Poults were tagged and placed into individual pens (20 per pen, 4 replicate pens per treatment) within the <b>brooding</b> <b>house,</b> and performance was evaluated by body weight or body weight gain. In the first experiment, poults receiving 1 of 2 probiotic cultures weighed significantly more than nontreated or antibiotic-treated poults.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the monthly hen day egg {{production}} (HDEP %), egg weights, total egg mass and mortality of two commercial egg strains and the indigenous chicken with their inbred progenies. The results indicate significant (P< 0. 05, 0. 01) inbreeding depression in the HDEP %, egg weight and total egg mass of the two commercial strains but not in the indigenous <b>chicken.</b> <b>Brooding</b> mortality was higher in the parents compared to their inbred progenies. The inbred progenies recorded higher mortality than the parents during the rearing and laying periods especially in the two commercial strains. It was concluded that the exotic commercial hybrid should not be used as breeders for the production of day old chicks for commercial egg production...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{initiation}} of seasonal feather molting in wild avian species frequently coincides with {{incubation of eggs}} and brooding of offspring. A period of natural inappetence or anorexia usually accompanies this molt. This is particularly true of the jungle fowl, the wild ances-tor of the domestic <b>chicken.</b> <b>Brooding</b> of eggs by the jungle fowl is accompanied by spontaneous anorexia, with little food or water consumed throughout the period of egg incubation. During this time, the reproductive tract re-gresses, and feather molting is initiated. Selective breed-ing for {{a high rate of}} egg production has blunted the response of the commercial laying hen to exogenous envi-ronmental cues and reduced or eliminated the endoge-nous biological cues that coordinate {{initiation of}} seasonal molting. However, commercial layers retain in their phys-(Key words: induced molting, molt, molting physiology, immune function, laying hen...|$|R

40|$|Performance {{evaluation}} of a Trombe wall powered poultry <b>house</b> for <b>brooding</b> day-old chicks was undertaken. The poultry house consists of a Trombe wall for solar energy collection and storage, a brooding room having a floor area measuring 6. 6 m 2. The house was tested experimentally with poultry day-old chicks under University of Nigeria, Nsukka, weather, over the ambient environmental temperature range of 18 - 37 o C and daily global irradiance of 5. 7 - 904 W/m 2 {{for a period of}} 5 years. The measured Trombe outer wall temperature was within the range of 22 - 60 o C.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of age of release, strain and farmers location on growth and carcass performance of the indigenous, and two exotic strains (Harco® and Goldline®) cockerels, reared on free range; in order to ascertain the best age of release into free range from <b>brooder</b> <b>houses,</b> as well as the effect of farmers location and strain on their growth and carcass characteristics, in South Eastern Nigeria. A total of 315 cockerels comprising 87 indigenous chicks, 114 Harco® chicks, and 114 Goldline® cockerels brooded and raised up to 18 weeks of age were used in this experiment. These birds were randomly released to farmers in the villages at three different ages of 4, 8 and 12 weeks to run on free range. There were significant effects of age of release and strain on the growth characteristics, but none on the carcass characteristics. However, there was also significant effect of the zone on both growth and carcass traits measured. It was concluded that the earlier the exotic birds are released from the <b>brooder</b> <b>house,</b> the better their performance on scavenging rearing. This is beneficial as the farmer will save much from the purchase of compounded feed and other veterinary services...|$|R

2500|$|... "The Frieze of Life" [...] themes recur {{throughout}} Munch's {{work but}} he especially focused {{on them in}} the mid-1890s. In sketches, paintings, pastels and prints, he tapped {{the depths of his}} feelings to examine his major motifs: the stages of life, the femme fatale, the hopelessness of love, anxiety, infidelity, jealousy, sexual humiliation, and separation in life and death. These themes are expressed in paintings such as The Sick Child (1885), Love and Pain (retitled Vampire; 1893–94), Ashes (1894), and The Bridge. The latter shows limp figures with featureless or hidden faces, over which loom the threatening shapes of heavy trees and <b>brooding</b> <b>houses.</b> Munch portrayed women either as frail, innocent sufferers (see Puberty and Love and Pain) or as the cause of great longing, jealousy and despair (see Separation, Jealousy, and Ashes).|$|R
