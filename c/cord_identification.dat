40|$|AbstractWe {{propose a}} <b>cord</b> <b>identification</b> {{technique}} for ultra-low bending loss fiber using higher order modes of visible light. With {{this kind of}} fiber, bending losses are greatly reduced {{and it is difficult}} to obtain sufficient leaked light with a conventional macro-bending technique. The bending loss of higher order modes is several orders larger than that of fundamental modes. Higher order modes can exist at shorter wavelengths and their guiding loss is small when the fiber is not tightly bent. As a result, higher order modes are suitable for <b>cord</b> <b>identification</b> purposes with ultra-low bending loss fiber. We determined that the LP 21 and LP 02 modes at 650 nm (red) and the LP 31 mode at 532 nm (green) are the most effective for <b>cord</b> <b>identification</b> purposes. We employed an offset launch technique to excite higher order modes, and achieved a sensitivity improvement of more than 14 dB. By using our method, a cord can be identified by red or green light even with the naked eye...|$|E
40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is a paralytic disorder {{caused by}} degeneration of motor neurons {{in the brain}} and spinal <b>cord.</b> <b>Identification</b> of mutations in the gene for Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD 1) in a subset of ALS families made it possible to develop a transgenic mouse model of ALS and to investigate its pathogenesis. These investigations suggest that mutant SOD 1 acts through a toxic gain of function which may involve generation of free radicals. Conformational change in the mutant SOD 1 protein, especially the distortion of the ‘rim ’ of the electrostatic guidance channel may be central to this toxic gain of function and to the pathogenesis of ALS...|$|E
40|$|SummaryShh-Gli {{signaling}} controls cell fates in {{the developing}} ventral neural tube by regulating the patterned expression of transcription factors in neural progenitors. However, the molecular mechanisms that limit target gene responses to specific domains are unclear. Here, we show that Wnt pathway inhibitors regulate the threshold response of a ventral Shh target gene, Nkx 2. 2, to establish its restricted expression in the ventral spinal <b>cord.</b> <b>Identification</b> and characterization of an Nkx 2. 2 enhancer reveals that expression is directly regulated by positive Shh-Gli signaling and negative Tcf repressor activity. Our data indicate that the dorsal limit of Nkx 2. 2 is controlled by Tcf 4 -mediated transcriptional repression, and not by a direct requirement for high-level Shh-Gli signaling, arguing against a simple model based on differential Gli factor affinities in target genes. These results identify a transcriptional mechanism that integrates graded Shh and Wnt signaling to define progenitor gene expression domains and cell fates in the neural tube...|$|E
40|$|Meta-analysis of gene {{expression}} array databases {{has the potential}} to reveal information about gene function. The identification of gene-gene interactions may be inferred from {{gene expression}} information but such meta-analysis is often limited to a single microarray platform. To address this limitation, we developed a gene-centered approach to analyze differential expression across thousands of gene expression experiments and created the CO-Regulation Database (CORD) to determine which genes are correlated with a queried gene. Using the GEO and ArrayExpress database, we analyzed over 120, 000 group by group experiments from gene microarrays to determine the correlating genes for over 30, 000 different genes or hypothesized genes. CORD output data is presented for sample queries with focus on genes with well-known interaction networks including p 16 (CDKN 2 A), vimentin (VIM), MyoD (MYOD 1). CDKN 2 A, VIM, and MYOD 1 all displayed gene correlations consistent with known interacting genes. We developed a facile, web-enabled program to determine gene-gene correlations across different gene expression microarray platforms. Using well-characterized genes, we illustrate how <b>CORD's</b> <b>identification</b> of co-expressed genes contributes to a better understanding a gene's potential function.

40|$|A {{deficit of}} vitamin B 12, {{generally}} resulting from pernicious anaemia, can {{give rise to}} disorders of the spinal cord, brain, optic and peripheral nerves. The principal neurological syndrome is subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord (SCD), which can cause progressive motor and/or sensitive alterations, instability and incontinency, due to the demyelination of the posterior horn of the spinal <b>cord.</b> The <b>identification</b> by magnetic resonance (MR) of signal hyperintensity in T 2 weighted sequences {{at the level of}} the posterior horns of the spinal and/or cervical cord can be of great use in diagnosising the patient with SCD, above all when the symptoms are mild or nonspecific, and the patient does not have haematological or gastrointestinal alterations. Besides, the evolution of the altered signal of the posterior horns in MR can be of use in evaluating the efficacy of treatment, since their normalization is related to clinical improvemen...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} mutations in 25 known causative genes in 47 unrelated Chinese families with cone-rod dystrophy (CORD). Forty-seven probands from unrelated families with CORD were recruited. Genomic DNA prepared from leukocytes was analyzed by whole exome sequencing. Variants in the 25 genes were selected and then validated by Sanger sequencing. Fourteen potential pathogenic mutations, including nine novel and five known, were identified in 10 of the 47 families (21. 28 %). Homozygous, compound heterozygous, and hemizygous mutations were detected in three, four, or three families, respectively. The 14 mutations in the 10 families were distributed among CNGB 3 (three families), PDE 6 C (two families), ABCA 4 (one family), RPGRIP 1 (one family), RPGR (two families), and CACNA 1 F (one family). This study provides a brief view on mutation spectrum of the 25 genes in a Chinese cohort with <b>CORD.</b> <b>Identification</b> of novel mutations enriched our understanding of variations in these genes and their associated phenotypes. To our knowledge, this is the first systemic exome-sequencing analysis of all of the 25 CORD-associated genes...|$|E
40|$|Synopsis Locomotor {{behavior}} in mammals requires a complex pattern of muscle activation. Neural networks, known as central pattern generators (CPGs) and located entirely within the spinal cord, {{are responsible for}} generating much of the timing and pattern required for locomotor movements. Historically, identification of interneuronal components of the locomotor CPG in walking mammals has proven troublesome, {{primarily because of the}} difficulty in identifying func-tionally homogeneous groups of neurons in the spinal cord. Recently, a molecular approach has been used to identify populations of genetically similar interneurons based on the expression of transcription factors early in embryonic development. Preliminary work on these cell populations has shown that many comprise essential components of the locomotor CPG. Here I identify populations of genetically-defined interneurons that are candidate ‘‘first-order’ ’ cells of this neural network, potentially responsible for generating the locomotor rhythm in the mammalian spinal <b>cord.</b> <b>Identification</b> of the cell population(s) responsible for this key function will provide valuable insight into the structure and function of the locomotor CPG and could potentially lay the groundwork for the development of strategies aimed at regenerating motor pathways following injury to the spinal cord. The locomotor central pattern generator: an overview Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) are functiona...|$|E
40|$|Damage to the {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerve (RLN) during thyroid or parathyroid {{surgery is}} the most common iatrogenic cause of vocal <b>cord</b> paralysis. <b>Identification</b> of the RLNs and meticulous surgical technique can significantly decrease the incidence of this complication. Nonrecurrent RLNs (NRRLNs) are exceedingly rare. Surgeons {{need to be aware of}} their position to avoid injuries. PATIENT AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 263 right RLN exposures (and 251 left RNL) over a 5 -year period was performed. RESULTS: Two NRRLNs were encountered, for an incidence of 0. 39 % (0. 76 % only for right dissection), without anatomic anomalies on the left side. The nerve anomaly was never preoperatively diagnosed. CONCLUSION: NRRLNs are rare and is associated with a right subclavian artery arising from distal aortic arch. Awareness of their existence and correct surgical technique will prevent the surgeon from accidentally lesion of NRRLN one if it is encountered during thyroid or parathyroid surgery...|$|R

40|$|Axons use {{temporal}} and directional guidance cues at intermediate targets {{to set the}} rate and direction of growth towards their synaptic targets. Our {{recent studies have shown}} that disrupting the temporal guidance process, by unilaterally accelerating the rate at which spinal dI 1 (commissural) axons grow, resulted in turning errors both in the ventral spinal cord and after crossing the floor plate. Here we investigate a mechanistic explanation for these defects: the accelerated dI 1 axons arrive in the ventral spinal cord before necessary fasciculation cues from incoming dI 1 axons from {{the opposite side of the}} spinal <b>cord.</b> The <b>identification</b> of such an interaction would support a model of selective fasciculation whereby the pioneering dI 1 axons serve as guides for the processes of the bilaterally symmetrical population of dI 1 neurons. To test this model, we first developed the ability to "double" in ovo electroporate the embryonic chicken spinal cord to independently manipulate the rate of growth of the two bilateral populations of dI 1 axons. Second, we examined the requirement for a putative bilateral interaction by unilaterally ablating the dI 1 population in cultured explants of chicken embryonic spinal cord. Surprisingly, we find no evidence for a bilateral dI 1 axon interaction, rather dI 1 axons appear to project independently of each other...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the maximum differential cervical spinal (C-spine) cord dose in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans of patients undergoing radiotherapy {{for treatment of}} head and neck cancer. Materials and Methods: The C-spine of ten head and neck cancer patients that were planned using IMRT and each cervical vertebral body and {{the right and left}} sides was contoured by splitting the cord in the center. Dose-volume histograms (DVH) and maximum point doses were obtained for each contour and compared. Results: The dose to the cord varied with the location of the primary tumor but such variation was not consistently seen. This report provides information that is critical for planning reirradiation treatments. We recommend that contouring of the C-spine cord with IMRT should include outlining of each cervical <b>cord</b> level and <b>identification</b> of {{the right and the left}} sides of the cord on each plan...|$|R
40|$|Spinal {{muscular atrophy}} {{is one of}} the most devastating {{neurological}} diseases of childhood. Affected infants and children suffer from often severe muscle weakness caused by degeneration of lower motor neurons in the spinal <b>cord</b> and brainstem. <b>Identification</b> of the causative genetic muta-tion in most cases has resulted in development of potential treatment strategies. To test these new drugs, clinically fea-sible outcomes are needed. Several different assessments, validated in spinal muscular atrophy or similar disorders, are being used by national and international research groups; however, their sensitivity to detect change is unknown. Acceptance of a few standardized, easily administered, and functionally meaningful outcomes, applicable to the phenoty-pic spectrum of spinal muscular atrophy, is needed. Consen-sus is imperative to facilitate collaboration and explore the ability of these measures to identify the therapeutic effect of disease-modifying agents.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{evaluate}} surgical {{identification of}} nonrecurrence of the inferior laryngeal nerve (NRILN) during thyroidectomy {{in patients with}} an aberrant subclavian artery (a. lusoria) as seen on CT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The medical files of patients treated by thyroidectomy between January 1998 -December 2000 (n = 583) were retrospectively reviewed for preoperative and postoperative mobility of the vocal <b>cords</b> and perioperative <b>identification</b> of NRILN. The available preoperative CT studies (n = 163) were reviewed for presence of a. lusoria. RESULTS: In five patients, the CT study revealed an a. lusoria (3. 16 %). In one of five of these patients, an NRILN was surgically detected; the overall detection rate of NRILN was 0. 21 %. In one of four patients with nonidentification of this nerve during surgery, immediate unilateral and permanent vocal cord paralysis were present after surgery. No permanent vocal cord paralysis occurred {{in any of the}} other patients. CONCLUSION: The identification of a. lusoria should alert the radiologist and surgeon that a NRILN is present, allowing an anticipating surgical technique, reducing the risk of neural injury. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Intraoperative {{microvascular}} Doppler may {{be valuable}} in assisting in the surgical obliteration of dural arteriovenous fistula of the spinal <b>cord.</b> It enables <b>identification,</b> through flow spectrum analysis, of the anatomic components and haemodynamic {{features of this}} type of vascular malformation. METHODS: In two cases, intraoperative microvascular Doppler was used to assist in the surgical obliteration of dural arteriovenous fistula of the spinal cord. The fistulas were identified prior to the dura opening, and for this only minimally invasive surgery was required. Direct recordings of the arterialised draining vein and the nidus of the fistula demonstrated a pathological spectrum caused by the arterial supply and the disturbed venous outflow in which a high-resistance flow pattern and low diastolic flow resembling an arterial-like flow velocity were observed. FINDINGS: The fistulas were obliterated by interruption of the draining vein, and Doppler measurements provided information on flow velocity changes in the medullary veins from an arterial to a venous pattern. The absence of any residual flow in the draining vein confirmed successful haemodynamic treatment. INTERPRETATION: Intraoperative microvascular Doppler recording is valuable assistance in surgical closure of spinal arteriovenous fistula...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is a fatal disorder {{caused by}} the progressive degeneration of motoneurons in brain and spinal <b>cord.</b> Despite <b>identification</b> of disease-linked mutations, the diversity of processes involved and the ambiguity of their relative importance in ALS pathogenesis still represent a major impediment to disease models {{as a basis for}} effective therapies. Moreover, the human motor cortex, although critical to ALS pathology and physiologically altered in most forms of the disease, has not been screened systematically for therapeutic targets. Results By whole-genome expression profiling and stringent significance tests we identify genes and gene groups de-regulated in the motor cortex of patients with sporadic ALS, and interpret the role of individual candidate genes in a framework of differentially expressed pathways. Our findings emphasize the importance of defense responses and cytoskeletal, mitochondrial and proteasomal dysfunction, reflect reduced neuronal maintenance and vesicle trafficking, and implicate impaired ion homeostasis and glycolysis in ALS pathogenesis. Additionally, we compared our dataset with publicly available data for the SALS spinal cord, and show a high correlation of changes linked to the diseased state in the SALS motor cortex. In an analogous comparison with data for the Alzheimer's disease hippocampus we demonstrate a low correlation of global changes and a moderate correlation for changes specifically linked to the SALS diseased state. Conclusion Gene and sample numbers investigated allow pathway- and gene-based analyses by established error-correction methods, drawing a molecular portrait of the ALS motor cortex that faithfully represents many known disease features and uncovers several novel aspects of ALS pathology. Contrary to expectations for a tissue under oxidative stress, nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes are uniformly down-regulated. Moreover, the down-regulation of mitochondrial and glycolytic genes implies a combined reduction of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic energy supply, with a possible role in the death of ALS motoneurons. Identifying candidate genes exclusively expressed in non-neuronal cells, we also highlight the importance of these cells in disease development in the motor cortex. Notably, some pathways and candidate genes identified by this study are direct or indirect targets of medication already applied to unrelated illnesses and point the way towards the rapid development of effective symptomatic ALS therapies. </p...|$|R
