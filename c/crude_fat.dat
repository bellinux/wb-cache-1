5000|$|Russula virescens is an edible {{mushroom}} {{considered to}} be one of the best of the genus Russula, and is popular in Europe, particularly in Spain. In an 1875 work on the uses of fungi, English mycologist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke remarked about the mushroom that [...] "the peasants about Milan are in the habit of putting it over wood embers to toast, and eating it afterwards with a little salt." [...] The mushroom is often sold as a dried product in Asia, and in China, it can be found in roadside markets. Its smell is not distinctive, but its taste has been described as mild, nutty, fruity, or even sweet. Old specimens may smell of herrings. Drying the mushrooms enhances the nutty flavor. Mushrooms can be sautéed (the green color disappears with cooking), and young specimens that are prepared this way have a potato taste that pairs well with shallots. They are also fried or grilled, or used raw in salads. [...] Young specimens are pale and can be hard to identify, but the characteristic pattern of older fruit bodies makes them hard to confuse with other species. When collecting R. virescens for consumption, caution is of vital importance to avoid confusion with the dangerously poisonous Amanita phalloides (known as the death cap), a mushroom that can be most easily identified by its volva and ring. A lady amateur mycophagist of the writer's acquaintance, ... who is especially fond of the green Russula, is never at a loss for this especially prized tidbit as a reward for her daily stroll among the trees. A visitor may often see upon her buffet a small glass dish filled with the mushrooms, nicely scraped and cut in pieces—an ever-present relish between meals. For even in their natural state, as she discriminatingly says, they are [...] "as sweet as chestnuts". This is especially the case with the [...] "buttons" [...] or younger specimens. William Hamilton Gibson The nutritional components of R. virescens mushrooms have been characterized. Fresh mushrooms contain about 92.5% moisture.

Besides, crude protein in seed with different maturity stages does not show any trend as well. <b>Crude</b> <b>fat</b> and protein content were slightly higher in seed and skin of Salacca zalacca compare to pulp when ripened...|$|E
30|$|The three flours viz. {{corn flour}} (approximately {{containing}} moisture 2.7 %, crude protein 0.40 %, <b>crude</b> <b>fat</b> 0 %, carbohydrates 96.7 %), black gram flour (approximately moisture 10 %, crude protein 22 %, <b>crude</b> <b>fat</b> 6 %, carbohydrates 57 %) and peanut flour (moisture 6 %, crude protein 27 %, <b>crude</b> <b>fat</b> 47 %, carbohydrates 19 %) were incorporated at three different levels viz. 10, 20 and 30 percent to replace corresponding amounts of rice flour {{in the formulation}} of fish curls. Based on various physicochemical and sensory parameters, incorporation of 20 percent corn flour, 10 percent black gram flour and 10 percent peanut flour were optimized as best.|$|E

The content of nutrients was determined in the fish muscle: <b>crude</b> protein, <b>fat,</b> ash and solids. Production share of natural food and supplementary feeding has been set. The fillets were measured basic texture properties such as hardness, chewiness, springiness and cohesiveness...|$|R
40|$|Dry biomass {{of algae}} {{is a good}} source of {{nutrients}} and biologically active substances, which in the last years attracted the interest of the specialists in their search for natural, ecologically and healthy sound foods for the animals. The aim {{of the present study was}} to characterize the chemical composition and the nutritive value of the dry biomass of fresh water algae of Chlorella genus cultivated in Bulgaria and to establish its effect on the laying hen productivity and the morphological characteristics of the table eggs. The tested product was analyzed for its crude protein content – 55 % to available wet, <b>crude</b> <b>fats</b> – 9, 6 %, crude fi bres – 6, 4 %, xanthophylls – 0, 6 g/kg, essential amino acids: lysine – 5, 5 %, methionine – 1, 2 %, triptophan – 1, 2 %. Adding 2 % and 10 % of dry biomass of fresh water algae of Chlorella genus to the combined forages for laying hens led to the improvement of the bird productivity and the morphological characteristics of the eggs and the egg yolk pigmentation was more intensive by 2, 5 units by the Roche’s scale...|$|R
