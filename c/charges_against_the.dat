The court, which sought his extradition, also stated that the drug lord conspired to traffic drugs to the U.S.|$|E

5|$|An {{incident}} {{during a}} game against Leicester City in the league saw Shearer charged with misconduct by the FA, with media sources claiming that video footage showed him intentionally kicking Neil Lennon in the head following a challenge. The referee of the game took no action against Shearer, and he was then cleared of all charges by the FA, with Lennon giving evidence in the player's defence. Former Football Association chief Graham Kelly, who brought the <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> player, later claimed in his autobiography that Shearer had threatened to withdraw himself from the 1998 World Cup squad if the charges were upheld; a claim strenuously denied by Shearer.|$|E
5|$|Espejo {{realized}} that the <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> clergy were so serious {{that he had to}} focus on destroying Barreto's credibility. Therefore, he implied that Barreto's own conduct was outrageous because of his excesses in collecting taxes and his habit of paying public funds to licentious women. Additionally, he stated that the real author of the report was José Miguel Vallejo, whom he called an immoral man who despised the clergy. Thus, Espejo claimed the report should not be believed.|$|E

In 1125 John of Crema, the papal legate to England, visited Durham to investigate <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bishop. Medieval chroniclers told the story that the legate was much taken with Ranulf's niece, and after sleeping with the girl, took no action on the charges against Ranulf.

A few days later, Balfour Beatty changed its plea to guilty on the health and safety charges and, on 6 September, Network Rail was found guilty of breaching health and safety law. Network Rail were fined £3.5 million while Balfour Beatty were fined £10 million. All of the manslaughter <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> executives were dismissed by the judge.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials of}} the sit-in {{participants}} attracted widespread interest throughout Nashville and the surrounding region. On February 29, {{the first day of}} the trials, a crowd of more than 2000 people lined the streets surrounding the city courthouse to show their support for the defendants. A group of 13 lawyers, headed by Z. Alexander Looby, represented the students. Initially, the trial was presided over by City Judge Andrew J. Doyle. Doyle dismissed the loitering <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> students and then stepped down from the bench, turning the trial over to Special City Judge John I. Harris.|$|E
5|$|At {{a public}} meeting in Alresford on 14 May, Onslow {{reported}} that subscriptions to the defence fund were already pouring in, and that invitations {{to visit and}} speak had been received from many towns. As the Claimant addressed meetings {{up and down the}} country, journalists following the campaign often commented on his pronounced cockney accent, suggestive of East London origins. The campaign drew in some high-level supporters, among whom was George Hammond Whalley, a controversial anti-Catholic who was MP for Peterborough. He and Onslow were sometimes incautious in their speeches; after a meeting in St James's Hall, London, on 11 December 1872, each made specific <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Attorney General and the Government of trying to pervert the course of justice. They were both fined £100 for contempt of court.|$|E

5|$|Federal {{agencies}} filed <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> KD IIs owner, {{operator and}} captain. They further sought forfeiture of the fins under in rem jurisdiction, {{resulting in the}} unusual case title. Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz granted the order in 2005. The boat's owners appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which reversed Moskowitz three years later. It held that the seizure was illegal for three reasons: the KD IIs activities {{did not meet the}} definition of a fishing vessel under the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Since it did not, under the SFPA, the fins could not have been lawfully seized on the high seas. In 2011, President Barack Obama signed the Shark Conservation Act into law, which closed these loopholes.|$|E
5|$|Formal <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{group were}} {{presented}} on June 4, the indictment running to 2,800 pages. By late June 2012, disquiet over the trio's detention without setting a trial date and concern over what {{was regarded as}} excessive and arbitrary treatment, led to the writing of an open letter. It was signed by leading opposition figures, {{as well as by}} director Fyodor Bondarchuk, a supporter of Putin, and actors Chulpan Khamatova and Yevgeny Mironov, both of whom had appeared in campaign videos supporting Putin's re-election. Singer Alla Pugachyova appealed on the women's behalf, stating that they should be ordered to perform community service rather than imprisoned. Meanwhile, Nikita Mikhalkov, head of the Russian Cinematographers' Union, stated that he would gladly sign an open letter against them.|$|E
5|$|In January 1943, Tirpitz {{emerged from}} the lengthy overhaul, after which she was {{transferred}} to Altafjord. Here, she participated in extensive training operations with Scharnhorst and the heavy cruiser , which lasted {{until the middle of}} the year. In early September, Tirpitz, Scharnhorst, and ten destroyers bombarded the island of Spitzbergen, which served as a British refuelling station. The two battleships destroyed their targets and returned safely to Altenfjord; {{this was the first time}} Tirpitz fired her main guns in anger. On 22–23 September, six British midget submarines attacked Tirpitz while at anchor. Two of the submarines successfully planted explosive <b>charges</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> battleship's hull, which did serious damage. Tirpitz had been successfully neutralised. Over the next six months, a workforce of some 1,000 men effected the needed repairs, which were finished by March 1944.|$|E
