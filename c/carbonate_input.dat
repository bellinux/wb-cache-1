40|$|Four main factors {{control the}} {{accumulation}} of periplatform sediment on the northeastern Nicaragua Rise: (1) input of carbonate sediment; (2) input of siliciclastic sediment; (3) physical redistribution of sediment; and (4) partial dissolution of carbonate phases (aragonite and magnesian calcite). The intensity of these factors is directly influenced by climatic variations and associated sea-level fluctuations, creating the cyclic glacial/interglacial pattern characteristic of late Quaternary high resolution stratigraphy in periplatform sediments. During interglacial stages, the bank/shelf tops of the Nicaragua Rise were submerged. The northwestward flowing Caribbean Current swept neritic sediments off-bank to the periplatform environment where they accumulated, by settling through the water column or by sediment gravity flow, preferentially in downcurrent areas. These neritic sediments along with pelagic carbonates, form a thick wedge of highstand sediment on the upper slopes. <b>Carbonate</b> <b>input</b> was locally augmented by siliciclastic sediment input from Jamaica during peak sea-level highstands. Finally, neritic aragonite deposited in water depths below 1100 m was subject to partial dissolution. Glacial sea-level lowstands were characterized by bank/shelf top exposure and lower production, therefore, neritic <b>carbonate</b> <b>input</b> to the periplatform environment was reduced. Nannoplankton productivity shows little glacial/interglacial variation, while glacial foraminifer productivity was only half interglacial levels. Consequently, bulk sediment accumulation rates and turbidite frequencies are lower during glacial stages than in interglacial stages. Bank-top exposure restricted flow of the Caribbean Current to seaways between the banks and shelves. This flow constriction considerably increased flow rates, winnowing sediments in areas of Walton Basin with water depths shallower than 600 m today. Partial dissolution of aragonite {{may be associated with}} the formation of magnesian calcite cements in current winnowed sediments. The geometry of the late Quaternary sedimentary bodies, displayed on 3. 5 kHz seismic lines, can be interpreted in a sequence stratigraphic framework for periplatform carbonate sediments. Lowstands are thin and overlain by thick accumulations of highstand sediments, all of which lap out on the steep bank/shelf margins. Transgressive systems tracts are too thin to be resolved on seismic data, but are revealed by subtle changes in interglacial sediment mineralogy...|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{sediment}} sequence (SP 05, 12. 5 m long) {{was taken}} from the deep zone of Lake Saint-Point (850 m a. s. l.). Sedimentological analyses highlight two main contrasted periods of sedimentation: the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) /Late Glacial characterized by high silicates and quartz contents the Holocene dominated by the carbonated fraction. At the beginning of the Holocene (11 400 years cal. BP), silicates fraction flux abruptly decreased. The shift between the Late Glacial and the Holocene periods may be explained by forest development in the catchment. From 10 200 to 6800 years cal. BP, silicates and detrital carbonate fractions remained stable before they progressively increased steady till 5000 years cal. BP. Both increases cannot be totally attributed to an anthropic impact since pollen data indicate continuous anthropic activities only dated back from 3000 years cal. BP. They thus resulted from a dominant climatic control. From 5000 years cal.

Biogenic coccolith-globigerinid oozes were deposited along with a constant but low background of fine terrigenous detritus at a mean sedimentation rate (compacted) of 6. 6 m/m. y. from Albian to Eocene time; individual stages deviate from this {{by a factor of}} two. Short-term variations in <b>carbonate</b> <b>input</b> yielded a sequence of limestone beds punctuated by thin shale interbeds. These shale-limestone couplets accumulated in time spans between 20, 000 and 100, 000 yr, and the thin shales may represent up to one-half of the total time. Modification by diagenetic solution, tectonic shear, and weathering render shale interbeds unsuitable for magnetic work. The limestone beds, first bioturbated and then compacted and cemented during diagenesis, appear likely to have recorded magnetic history at intervals on the order of 50, 000 yr, sufficient to provide a good record of polarity changes.

40|$|Shallow-water {{carbonate}} {{systems are}} reliable recorders of sea level fluctuations {{and changes in}} ambient seawater conditions. Drilling results from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 133 and 166 indicate that the timing of late Neogene sedimentary breaks triggered by sea level lowerings is synchronous in the sedimentary successions of the Queensland Plateau and the Great Bahama Bank. This synchrony indicates that these sea level changes were eustatic in origin. The carbonate platforms were also affected by contemporary, paleoceanographically controlled fluctuations in carbonate production. Paleoceanographic changes are recorded at 10. 7, 3. 6, and 1. 7 – 2. 0 Ma. At the Queensland Plateau, sea surface temperature shifts are documented by shifts from tropical to temperate carbonates (10. 7 Ma) and vice versa (3. 6 Ma); the modern tropical platform was established at 2. 0 – 1. 8 Ma. At Great Bahama Bank, changes were registered in compositional variations of platform-derived sediment, such as major occurrence of peloids (3. 6 Ma) and higher rates of neritic <b>carbonate</b> <b>input</b> (1. 7 Ma).

40|$|Detailed biostratigraphy in Site 1006 {{based on}} planktonic foraminifers and nannofossils shows {{large-scale}} sedimentation rate {{variability in the}} Florida Strait west of the Great Bahama Bank. A 'floating' cyclostratigraphy based mainly on resistivity logs and magnetic susceptibility data has been fixed to the biostratigraphy {{in the absence of}} magnetostratigraphy. The strongest orbital cycle present is the precessional beat, which is present in the borehole logs throughout the record. Counting the cycles resulted in an accurate time scale and thus a sedimentation rate time series. Spectral analysis of the sedimentation rate time series shows that the short-term cycle of eccentricity (~ 125 k. y.) and the long term cycle of eccentricity (~ 400 k. y.) are pervasive throughout the Miocene record, together with the long-term ~ 2 -m. y. eccentricity cycle. The Great Bahama Bank produced pulses of shallow <b>carbonate</b> <b>input</b> once every precessional (sea level) cycle during the Miocene and perhaps two pulses per cycle in the early Pliocene. The amount of sediment exported in these pulses appears to be controlled by eccentricity modulation of the precessional amplitude and therefore the amplitude of the sea-level rise. Finally, an increase in sedimentation rate just after the Miocene/Pliocene boundary is attributed to a change in the location and strength of sediment drift currents in the Florida Strait due to reorganization of the currents following the closure of the Panama Isthmus...|$|E

During both the Recent and LGM, carbonate content shows an east/west asymmetry with western basins exhibiting lower <b>carbonate</b> values. <b>Input</b> of ice-rafted detritus into the North Atlantic during LGM time interrupts this topographic control on carbonate distribution considerably farther south than at present; in the South Atlantic this effect is minor. Comparison of LGM and Recent sediment distributions indicates that the LGM seafloor was dominated by biogenic oozes, calcareous clays, and clays, while the Recent is dominated by biogenic oozes and marls. Coarse-grained detritus is much more prevalent in LGM sediments, derived not only from glacial input but also from fluvial and aeolian sources. Sedimentation rates, calculated from LGM to Recent sediment thickness in cores, are < 4 cm/ 1000 yr {{for most of the}} ocean.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{dramatic}} perturbations to the Earth system during the past 100 million years was the rapid onset of Antarctic glaciation near the Eocene/Oligocene epoch boundary 1, 2, 3 (34 million years ago). This climate transition was accompanied 3 by a deepening of the calcite compensation depth—the ocean depth at which the rate of calcium <b>carbonate</b> <b>input</b> from surface waters equals the rate of dissolution. Changes in the global carbon cycle 4, rather than changes in continental configuration 5, have recently been proposed as the most likely root cause of Antarctic glaciation, but the mechanism linking glaciation to the deepening of calcite compensation depth remains unclear. Here we use a global biogeochemical box model to test competing hypotheses put forward to explain the Eocene/Oligocene transition. We find that, of the candidate hypotheses, only shelf to deep sea carbonate partitioning is capable of explaining the observed changes in both carbon isotope composition and calcium carbonate accumulation at the sea floor. In our simulations, glacioeustatic sea-level fall associated with the growth of Antarctic ice sheets permanently reduces global calcium carbonate accumulation on the continental shelves, leading to an increase in pelagic burial via permanent deepening of the calcite compensation depth. At the same time, fresh limestones are exposed to erosion, thus temporarily increasing global river inputs of dissolved carbonate and increasing seawater 13 C. Our work sheds new light on the mechanisms linking glaciation and ocean acidity change across arguably the most important climate transition of the Cenozoic era. <br/...|$|E

These questions were addressed using counts of coarse (> 2 mm) ice rafted debris (IRD), magnetic susceptibility, grain-size spectra, and sediment mineral composition. A significant difference in these variables occurred between MS 3 and MIS 2, with the latter showing small to modest abrupt changes in felsic and mafic minerals and in IRD, compared to larger and less variable changes during MIS 2. The dominant bedrock source archived in the cores is the Cenozoic basaltic outcrops from East Greenland and Iceland (~ 60 %) but there are frequent pulses of felsic-rich sediments (~ 17 - 36 %), which coincided with Greenland stadials. There is also a persistent detrital <b>carbonate</b> <b>input.</b> The largest shift in most sediment proxies occurred ~ 28 - 30 cal ka BP reflecting the sustained expansion of the ice sheets.

40|$|Bas Auran, in {{south-eastern}} France, is {{the candidate}} area for Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) {{of the base}} of the Bathonian Stage (Middle Jurassic). In the Bas Auran area, upper Bajocian and lower Bathonian deposits are made up of limestone beds alternating with marls that correspond to the ‘Marno-calcaires à Cancellophycus’, below the ‘Terres Noires’ Formation. Taphonomic analyses of the successive ammonoid fossil assemblages provide new and complementary data for biostratigraphic completeness, palaeoenvironmental setting and sequence stratigraphy. Lithologic differentiation between limestone and marl intervals resulted from alternating episodes of <b>carbonate</b> <b>input</b> and starvation. Both lithologic phases may contain evidence for sedimentary and taphonomic reworking, associated with scours, that reflects low rates of sedimentation and stratigraphic condensation. Three successive types of elementary cycles resulted from increasing rates of stratigraphic condensation, sedimentary condensation and substrate stabilization during early Bathonian. The occurrence of reelaborated ammonoids (i. e. exhumed and displaced before their final burial) implies that tractive current flows or winnowing affected the burial of concretionary internal moulds. In the lower Bathonian strata, the dominance of homogeneous concretionary internal moulds of phragmocones, completely filled with sediment, is indicative of low rates of sedimentation and sediment accumulation, respectively associated with low degrees of stratigraphic and sedimentary condensation. However, at the Bajocian/ Bathonian transition, hemipelagic, bed-scale limestone–marl alternations show a maximum value of biostratigraphic completeness and there is no evidence for taphonomic condensation in the ammonoid fossil assemblages. Taphonomic analyses of the successive ammonoid fossil assemblages and taphofacies confirm the development of a deepening phase associated with sedimentary starvation, which characterizes the last episode within the deepening half-cycle of third and second order cycles, in the Bas Auran area of French Subalpine Basin during early Bathonian...|$|E

In this context, important knowledge on the water cycle in the wetlands is required to manage specific actions to restore and preserve these areas. In this study, we propose to use chemical and multi-isotopic approaches combined with hydrological measurements (piezometric level and stream flow measurements) to trace the fluxes of water and dissolved element involved in the "Narces de la Sauvetat" peatland (France) and for the stream draining the area. Aims are to evaluate the water status of this ecosystem as well as the origin of dissolved elements and possible anthropogenic impacts. These approaches clearly demonstrated their effectiveness to improve the knowledge on the hydrological functioning of wetlands ecosystems.

40|$|ABSTRACT. —The Bocas del Toro {{archipelago}} in the Caribbean sea on {{the northwest}} coast of Panama has high annual rainfall (> 3000 mm) and a mountainous watershed, resulting in high inflow of fresh water. The two main lagoons have different geologic structure and different inputs; while Bahía Almirante has carbon-ate sediment and a relatively small watershed, Laguna de Chiriquí has predominantly siliclastic sediment and a very large watershed. The region also {{has a long history}} of clearing and agriculture. The purpose of this research was to use the seagrass Thalassia testudinum as a bio-indicator of nutrient status of these lagoons, particularly to assess the extent and influence of mainland inputs of freshwater, nutrients and sediments. Leaf tissue nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as surface water quality and porewater nutrients, were mea-sured from 32 sites throughout the archipelago.

40|$|The steeply-dipping-dolostone-hosted caves of the Sierra de Arnero (N Spain) contain low-gradient relict canyons {{with up to}} ten mapped {{levels of}} {{ferromanganese}} stromatolites and associated wall notches over a vertical range of 85 m, the highest occurring 460 m above base level. Despite a plausible speleogenetic contribution by pyrite oxidation, and the irregular cave-wall mesomorphologies suggestive of hypogenic speleogenesis, the Arnero relict caves are dominantly epigenic, {{as indicated by the}} conduit pattern and the abundant allogenic sediments. Allogenic input declined over time due to a piracy-related decrease in the drainage area of allogenic streams, explaining the large size of the relict Arnero caves relative to the limited present-day outcrop area of the karstified <b>carbonates.</b> Allogenic-sediment <b>input</b> also explains the observed change from watertable canyons to phreatic conduits in the paleo-downstream direction. Stromatolites and notches arguably formed in cave-stream passages at the watertable. The best-defined paleo-watertables show an overall slope of 1. 7 °, consistent with the present-day relief of the watertable, with higher-slope segments caused by barriers related to sulfide mineralization. The formation of watertable stromatolites favored wall notching by the combined effect of enhanced acidity by Mn–Fe oxidation and shielding of cave floors against erosion. Abrasive bedload further contributed to notch formation by promoting lateral mechanical erosion and protecting passage floors. The irregular wallrock erosional forms of Arnero caves are related partly to paragenesis and partly to the porous nature of the host dolostones, which favored irregular dissolution near passage walls, generating friable halos. Subsequent mechanical erosion contributed to generate spongework patterns. The dolostone porosity also contributes to explain the paradox that virtually all Arnero caves are developed in dolostone despite being less soluble than adjacent limestone. U-series dating of carbonate speleothems and paleomagnetic data from ferromanganese stromatolites and clastic sediments indicate that the paleo-watertables recorded 320 m above the present-day watertable formed during the Matuyama Chron but prior to 1. 5 Ma, implying long-term base-level-lowering rates from 125 to 213 m/Ma. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt of paleomagnetic dating of cave ferromanganese stromatolites.

40|$|The ocean depth {{at which}} the rate of calcium <b>carbonate</b> <b>input</b> from surface waters equals the rate of {{dissolution}} is termed the calcite compensation depth. At present, this depth is ~ 4, 500 m, with some variation between and within ocean basins. The calcite compensation depth is linked to ocean acidity, which is in turn linked to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and hence global climate (Broecker and Peng, 1987). Geological records {{of changes in the}} calcite compensation depth show a prominent deepening of more than 1 km near the Eocene/Oligocene boundary (~ 34 million years ago) (van Andel, 1975, doi: 10. 1016 / 0012 - 821 X(75) 90086 - 2) when significant permanent ice sheets first appeared on Antarctica (Kennett and Shackleton, 1976, doi: 10. 1038 / 260513 a 0; Miller et al., 1991, doi: 10. 1029 / 90 JB 02015; Zachos et al., 1996, doi: 10. 1029 / 96 PA 00571; Lear et al., 2000, doi: 10. 1126 /science. 287. 5451. 269), but the relationship between these two events is poorly understood. Here we present ocean sediment records of calcium carbonate content as well as carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions from the tropical Pacific Ocean that cover the Eocene/Oligocene boundary. We find that the deepening of the calcite compensation depth was more rapid than previously documented and occurred in two jumps of about 40, 000  years each, synchronous with the stepwise onset of Antarctic ice-sheet growth. The glaciation was initiated, after climatic preconditioning (DeConto and Pollard, 2003, doi: 10. 1038 /nature 01290), by an interval when the Earth's orbit of the Sun favoured cool summers. The changes in oxygen-isotope composition across the Eocene/Oligocene boundary are too large to be explained by Antarctic ice-sheet growth alone and must therefore also indicate contemporaneous global cooling and/or Northern Hemisphere glaciation...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{carbonate}} mounds {{have been}} discovered along the NW European Continental Margin. Many of them are covered by thickets of the ahermatypic corals. To unravel the processes active on the mound, in a case study on Propeller Mound its carbonate budget has been assessed and the mound development has been modelled. In addition benthic foraminiera assemblages have been analysed. Propeller Mound is a ~ 150 m elevated mound in the Porcupine Seabight ca. 90 nautical miles west off South-Ireland. The carbonate budget shows that on Propeller Mound the sediments contain on average > 50 wt. -% CaCO 3 for the last 175 kyrs. In contrast, the sediments from the reference sites off Propeller Mound contain < 37 wt. -% CaCO 3 for Holocene and < 23 wt. -% CaCO 3 for glacial sediments. The approximately 30 wt. -% difference between on- and off-mound locations represents the <b>carbonate</b> <b>input</b> due to aragonite added by the corals but extended hiatuses reduce the net long-term CaCO 3 accumulation rates on Propeller Mound to ~ 5 % of the off-mound signal. Stable oxygen isotope data, AMS 14 C and U/Th ages show that glacial and interglacial sediments were either not deposited or were later eroded on the mound. Instead, almost exclusively interstadial sequences stabilised by loose coral frameworks have been preserved. These sedimentary patterns {{may be linked to}} the changing influence of Mediterranean Outflow Water at the mound location. Distinct similarities between benthic foraminiferal assemblages found on-mound with assemblages found in the Mediterranean Sea also point towards a link between MOW and the mound. This interactions result in a spatially and temporally complex sedimentary record on Propeller Mound, impossible to correlate. In contrast to on mound sediments, those deposited in the areas adjacent to Propeller Mound contain more or less continuous records. The discrepancy between on and off-mound sediments imply that at least for the last ~ 300 kyrs Propeller Mound has been shrinking...|$|E
40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis applies a new isotope tracer, stable strontium isotopes (δ 88 / 86 Sr), to address questions concerning changes in global climate that occur in response to continental weathering processes, and to constrain the modern marine geochemical Sr cycle. Stable Sr isotopes are a relatively new geochemical proxy, and as such their behavior needs to be understood in differing forms of marine calcium carbonate, the archives from which records of past stable Sr variability in the oceans can be constructed. Foraminifera, coccoliths and corals (both aragonite and high Mg calcite) acquire δ 88 / 86 Sr values lighter than that of modern day seawater, (approximately 0. 11, 0. 05, 0. 2 and 0. 19 ‰ lighter than seawater at ~ 25 °C respectively) providing a measureable offset {{which can be used}} to constrain the modern Sr outputs from the ocean and provide {{a better understanding of the}} modern Sr cycle. Using foraminifera as a sedimentary archive the first marine δ 88 / 86 Sr record of seawater over the last two glacial cycles has been constructed, and used to investigate changing <b>carbonate</b> <b>input</b> and output over this 145 kyr period. Modelling of the large excursion of δ 88 / 86 Sr to heavier values during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3, reveals that this is more likely to be due to local changes in seawater or post-depositional alteration, rather then whole ocean changes. In the terrestrial environment δδ 88 / 86 Sr has been measured in the dissolved load of rivers from the Himalaya. It is found that, in general, rivers draining carbonate catchments possess lighter isotopic δ 88 / 86 Sr values than those from rivers draining silicates. Covariations of either δ 88 / 86 Sr vs. δ 30 Si or δ 88 / 86 Sr vs. 1 /[Sr] can be used to distinguish between rivers draining different catchment areas.

Elemental X-ray fluorescence determinations were performed on a dated short core extracted from the deepest part of the lake. Chemical (Ca, Sr, Al, K, Si, Ti and Fe) variation was analyzed along with physical (magnetic susceptibility, dry bulk density and medium particle size) and mineralogical proxies, as well as carbon and nitrogen contents (organic and inorganic carbon and organic nitrogen). Multicomponent statistical analyses allowed the identification of the main environmental processes ruling sedimentation, which included <b>carbonate</b> precipitation, detrital <b>input</b> and primary productivity. Homogeneous, carbonate-rich, detrital-rich and organic matter-poor deposits reflect very shallow and ephemeral lake conditions during the last years of the LIA period. Very low sedimentation rates and the presence of discontinuities in the sedimentary record pointed to episodes of extensive lake shrinkages and probable lake-floor subaerial exposures. Bedded and laminated organic-rich muds accumulated in perennial lake conditions after ca. AD 1880 reveal an important environmental change concurrent with the onset of the Current Warm Period. The contrast of sediment composition and lithological characteristics with the instrumental record of the CWP allowed us to consider the development of a shallow saline-lake system, enhanced detrital <b>input</b> and <b>carbonate</b> precipitation during dry periods. In turn, higher lake levels, and thus more diluted lake-waters during wetter periods, resulted in enhanced organic lake productivity and lower carbonate precipitation. The comparison of the paleolimnological reconstruction from Melincue Lake to different hydrological and paleoclimatic records (i. e. limnimetric measurements and ocean temperature changes) suggests that the moisture variation registered between the LIA and the CWP was consistent with (and likely forced by) large-scale climatic oscillations.

The main focus of this thesis is the Arctic Ocean foraminiferal record and its application to reconstruct paleoceanographic variations and summer sea ice cover changes between late Quaternary interglacial periods. One of the studied cores was retrieved from the central Lomonosov Ridge Intra Basin. This core contains a relatively high-resolution biostratigraphic record spanning Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 1 – 3, although with a hiatus encompassing the Last Glacial Maximum. Radiocarbon age calibrations in this core show a decreasing trend of high marine reservoir ages of about 1400 years during the last deglaciation to 700 years in the late Holocene. The cores from the Lomonosov Ridge off Greenland and the Morris Jesup Rise contain preserved calcareous microfossils further back in time than most previously studied central Arctic Ocean cores. The calcium content estimated by X-ray fluorescence scanning of these cores shows a distinct pattern of calcium rich intervals coinciding with peaks in foraminiferal abundance in the sediment record of MIS 1 – 7. The calcium peaks originate from material accumulated during interglacials, primarily through detrital <b>carbonate</b> and dolomite <b>input</b> from the decaying North American ice sheet and secondarily from biogenic material. Intervals of calcareous benthic foraminifera are found in pre MIS 7 sediments on both the southern Lomonosov Ridge and Morris Jesup Rise. Their assemblage composition and stable carbon isotope data suggest increased primary production and decreased summer sea ice cover compared to the Holocene central Arctic Ocean. This is also suggested for an interval of high abundance of the subpolar planktic foraminifera Turborotalita quinqueloba on the southern Lomonosov Ridge with a proposed MIS 11 age.

40|$|Three ODP sites {{located on}} the Marion Plateau, Northeast Australian margin, were {{investigated}} for clay mineral and bulk mineralogy changes through the early to middle Miocene. Kaolinite to smectite (K/S) ratios, as well as mass accumulation rates of clays, point to a marked decrease in accumulation of smectite associated {{with an increase in}} accumulation of kaolinite starting at ~ 15. 6 Ma, followed by a second increase in accumulation of kaolinite at ~ 13. 2 Ma. Both of these increases are correlative to an increase in the calcite to detritus ratio. Comparison of our record with published precipitation proxies from continental Queensland indicates that increases in kaolinite did not correspond to more intense tropical-humid conditions, but instead to periods of greater aridity. Three mechanisms are explored to explain the temporal trends in clay on the Marion Plateau: sea-level changes, changes in oceanic currents, and denudation of the Australian continent followed by reworking and eolian transport of clays. Though low mass accumulation rates of kaolinite are compatible with a possible contribution of eolian material after 14 Ma, when Australia became more arid, the lateral distribution of kaolinite along slope indicates mainly fluvial input for all clays and thus rules out this mechanism as well as oceanic current transport as the main controls behind clay accumulation on the plateau. We propose a model explaining the good correlation between long-term sea-level fall, decrease in smectite accumulation, increase in kaolinite accumulation and increase in <b>carbonate</b> <b>input</b> to the distal slope locations. We hypothesize that during low sea level and thus periods of drier continental climate in Queensland, early Miocene kaolinite-rich lacustrine deposits were being reworked, and that the progradation of the heterozoan carbonate platforms towards the basin center favored input of carbonate to the distal slope sites. The major find of our study is that increase kaolinite fluxes on the Queensland margin during the early and middle Miocene did not reflect the establishment of a tropical climate, and this stresses that care must be taken when reconstructing Australian climate based on deep-sea clay records alone...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} mineralogic {{and stable}} isotopic records generated for piston cores and Ocean Drilling Program holes recovered from intermediate water depths (500 to 2500 meters) near carbonate platforms around the world. Study areas included the Bahamas (western North Atlantic Ocean), the Nicaragua Rise (Caribbean Sea), the Maldives (north equatorial Indian Ocean), and the Queensland Plateau (southwest Pacific Ocean). Mineralogic data includes percent fine aragonite content, percent fine Mg calcite content, pteropod (aragonitic holoplanktonic gastropods) abundance, percent whole pteropods, {{and for some}} cores, percent clear pteropods. Carbonate data were interpreted {{both in terms of}} <b>carbonate</b> <b>input</b> from the nearby banks and in terms of seafloor dissolution. Planktic foraminiferal δ 18 O records were used as the primary chronostratigraphic tool for all sites. Statistical analyses of four metastable CaCO 3 dissolution proxies yielded a composite dissolution index (CDI) that displays different dissolution histories for Bahama and Nicaragua Rise sediments over the last 200, 000 years. These differences are not predicted by intermediate to deep water nutrient fractionation models (e. g., Boyle, 1988). A good correlation is observed between the Caribbean CDI record (this study) and CaCO 3 dissolution and benthic δ 13 C records from 4641 meters in the Venezuela Basin, Caribbean Sea (Cofer-Shabica, 1987). It is concluded that during the last 200, 000 years, variable cross-equatorial flux of Antarctic Intermediate Water has strongly influenced Caribbean carbon chemistry at water depths greater than 1100 meters. The assumption, therefore, that deep Caribbean sediment cores reliably record nutrient and (CO 3 =) variations of average mid-depth Atlantic water may need re-evaluation. Over longer time scales, CaCO 3 dissolution records from intermediate water depths near the Bahamas, Maldives, and Queensland Plateau are similar to deep-water dissolution records. Dissolution occurred from thermocline to abyssal depths from 500, 000 to 300, 000 years ago (during the middle Brunhes Chron) and between 1, 000, 000 and 900, 000 years ago revealing that whole-ocean changes in carbonate chemistry have occurred during the Quaternary. Enhanced CaCO 3 dissolution may be related to decreased Ca 2 + flux to the ocean (decreased glacial weathering) and increased neritic CaCO 3 production and accumulation during periods of elevated interglacial sea-level highstands...|$|E
40|$|Two ultra-high {{resolution}} IMAGES sediment cores {{from the}} SW continental {{slope of the}} Barents Sea and the Vøring Plateau are used to reconstruct fluctuations of a Barents Sea ice sheet with respect to variations in flow intensity {{and direction of the}} Norwegian Current during the last glacial-to-interglacial cycle (> 40 - 6. 6 14 C kyr BP equal to 45 - 7. 5 cal. kyr BP). Detailed planktic AMS 14 C records from both locations reveal a strong tendency towards higher ages during periods of intense meltwater and/or glacial activity on the Barents shelf. Ages in the core from the continental slope are heavily influenced by reworked 14 C-free foraminiferal tests from the Barents shelf. Reworked foraminiferal accumulation rates were quantified by tuning the planktic d 18 O profile to the GISP 2 d 18 O ice core record. In conjunction with the ice-rafted detritus record, this new proxy shows that ice reached the shelf edge at least twice during the mid-Weichselian and was used to develop a new glaciation curve for the SW Barents Sea. Ice sheet growth and decay on the Barents shelf was sensitive to variations in the intensity of the Norwegian Current, which ultimately lead to the final break-up of the Barents Sea ice sheet {{at the end of the}} last glacial maximum. A general analogy for major meltwater episodes is found in Heinrich Event 1 (H 1) : a strong inflow of Atlantic water, documented by a rapid rise in planktic d 13 C values, followed by the actual meltwater discharge, represented by pronounced d 18 O/d 13 C minima and massive ice-rafted detritus and reworked foraminiferal <b>carbonate</b> <b>input.</b> On the Vuring Plateau, 14 C ages measured at the onset of HI were probably biased by an increased inflow and up-welling of 'old' North Atlantic Intermediate Water resulting from a reversal of the Norwegian Current in response to massive meltwater input from the Barents Sea. The younger 14 C ages marking H 1 in the Norwegian Sea suggest a delayed Barents Sea meltwater discharge of up to 1500 years with respect to the Laurentide H 1 signal in the open N. Atlantic...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed to give new {{insights}} useful to enlighten {{the relationships between}} the Alpine Units (Alpine Corsica Auctt.) outcropping in the NE sector of Corsica and hence helpful to reconstruct the geodynamic history of this sector of the alpine belt. In Corsica, the Alpine Units consists of a stack of (frequently laminated) oceanic and continental units which overlying the Variscan hasement (Hercynian Corsica Auctt.) of the Corso-European foreland. In some areas, the pile of the Alpine Units is still a puzzle and both lithostratigraphy and age of some units are still debatable. In the Omessa area, between Corte and Ponte Leccia, the tectonic pile includes the Tenda Unit (cfr. Tenda Massif Auctt.), the Caporalino-Sant'Angelo Unit, the Santa Lucia Nappe and the Schistes lustrks s. 1. Among these units, the type of deposit and the age of the succession assigned to the Caporalino-Sant'Angelo Unit is still matter of debate. Earliest geologist consider the Caporalino-Sant'Angelo unit as a continuous sedimentary succession which spans in age from Lower Jurassic to Eocene. Later, some of these authors confirmed the continuity of the sedimentation of the Lower Jurassic to Eocene deposits assigned to the Caporalino-Sant'Angelo Unit and interpret the Caporalino limestone as a shallow-water platform deposit or a pelagic succession characterized by <b>carbonate</b> platform <b>input.</b> In contrast with this interpretation, the Caporalino-Sant'Angelo Unit was considered as coarse grained deposits with huge olistoliths sedimented in a distinct Eocene basin. Aim {{of this paper is to}} improve the lithoshatigraphy and the biostratigraphy of the Caporalino-S. Angelo Unit in order to the make clear the type of deposit and the age of this (Alpine) unit and to suggest the palaeogeographic location of its sedimentary basin. Based on a new geological mapping of the Corte-Pontee Leccia area and the lithostratigraphy of the three key composite. sections, the Caporalino-Sant'Angelo Unit consists of three coarse-grained clastic intervals and eight levels. The lower interval is composed of hreccias conglomerates and sandstones. The middle interval mainly consists of hreccias conglomerates and olithosliths (e. g. Caporalino Limestone); in the upper part of this interval are mark and breccias with clasts of Caporalino Limestone. Fine-grained sandstones with pelitic intercalation and rare conglomeratic beds characterize the upper interval. According to the recovered microfossil (calcareous nannofossils and foraminifera) assemblages the entire Caporalino-Sant'Angelo Unit is Early to Middle Eocene in age. Consequently, the previous model of a continuous Jurassic- Eocene stratigraphic succession is no longer valid and thj following scenario could he outlined: 1) during the Early-Middle Eocene the Caporalino-S. Angeh unit settled in an siliciclastic basin which received coarse graineb deposits such as breccias and conglomerates, olistoshomes and olistoliths (mainly composed by Upper Jurassic platform limestones) and sandstones and intercalation of silty mark and conglomerates, 2) the coarse-grained clastic sediments and the Upper Jurassic calcareous olistoliths, could have an inner place of origin (they probably represent the remnants of a carbonate platform emplaced over the Corso hasement); 3) consequently the Caporalino Sant'Angelo Unit was a foredeep basin, situated between the outer margin represented by the European foreland, and the inner margin, constituted yet by the corso hasement and its calcareous cover, 4) later the Santa Lucia Nappe and the Schistes lushb were thrusted on the Caporalino-S.

40|$|Prediction {{of fluid}} {{pressure}} before drilling, using geophysical methods helps the industry {{a lot in}} saving human life, drilling hazards, and equipments. There are several geophysical methods available to predict the fluid pressure before drilling but {{the most commonly used}} in the industry are those based on seismic velocities. However, seismic velocities methods are applied on clastic reservoirs with the assumptions that the pressure mechanism is due to mechanical compaction. A major exploration challenge is to successfully predict the presence of high pressure zones in the carbonate reservoirs. Carbonate reservoirs have a more complicated internal structure than clastic reservoirs. The main objective {{of this study is to}} predict the carbonate reservoir properties such as porosity and fluid pressure. The new prediction methods that I used in this thesis are called the artificail intelligent algorithms. These algorithms are better than the conventional geophysical methods because of their ability to explore complex relationships between the input seismic attributes and the predicted properties. The algorithms include artificial neural networks and group methods of data handling. Empirical equations from seismic prediction methods were used to transform velocities to fluid pressure. High resolution velocites (wavefrom tomography) proved that better prediction can be achieved when using better input velocity. The velocity methods performed a nice prediction when used with clastic seismic data but proved to give unreliable results when used with the carbonate seismic data. This was because of the difficult internal structure of carbonate reservoirs. The neural network methods proved that they are robust in clustering and segmenting the <b>input</b> <b>carbonate</b> seismic data. The usage of more input seismic attributes made the neural network methods better than the conventional velocity methods. Also, this gave the neural network methods more information about the same physical reservoir property. Among the different seismic attributes used in the experiment, seismic inversion and coherence attributes showed good reaction to high pressure zones. Porosity results from the supervised neural network method were used as a guide to the unsupervised neural network method to predict fluid pressure. The group method of data handling algorithm is performed here for the first time with seismic data to predict the reservoir properties. The new method showed faster and easier prediction than the neural network methods. The automation of the new method yields to better porosity and pore pressure prediction.

40|$|Abundant {{dolomite}} (MgCa(CO 3) 2) {{occurs in}} the Middle and Late Triassic carbonate record of the Tethys realm. Whereas dolomite formation is largely related to late diagenesis and/or hydrothermal activity, Preto et al. (2015) suggested a primary origin of dolomite beds and nodules intercalated in clay rich deposits of the Carnian Travenanzes Formation (Fm.; Dolomites, Venetian Alps) based on a transmission electron microscopy study. Thus, dolomites of the Travenanzes Fm. {{are supposed to have}} formed during or soon after deposition and its petrographic features may still be indicative of the geochemical conditions prevalent in the depositional setting. The Travenanzes Fm. records both <b>carbonate</b> and siliciclastic <b>input,</b> reflecting a transitional continental to shallow marine environment (Breda and Preto, 2011) with alternations of alluvial plains, sabkhas and/or ephemeral lakes. The goal {{of this study is to}} determine the microfacies of the dolomites of the Travenanzes Fm. and to discuss possible depositional environments and scenarios of penecontemporaneous dolomite formation. The samples were taken from the Dibona section described by Breda and Preto (2011). Optical microscopy documented three different types of dolomite: (1) Microcrystalline nodular dolomite shows abundant clay interlayers and fenestral pores filled with coelestine and barite. The homogenous microcrystalline dolomite was further investigated by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) mapping, revealing an anhedral to subhedral microstructure of grains ranging from 2 to 10 micrometers in diameter. Some dolomite grew as spherules within the clay matrix. (2) Dolomite pebbles show semi-rounded edges in a dolosparitic matrix. (3) Dolomite with mm- to cm-scale lamination shows regularly spaced undulation with the cuspate side directed upwards. The laminae are also commonly affected by brittle or plastic deformation. Based on the petrographic observations, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) While the clay abundance reflects a high siliciclastic input in an alluvial plain to marginal marine setting, the nodular dolomite is consistent with growth under vadose conditions, where solutes are transported by capillary flow. (2) Reworking and synsedimentary deformation indicate a depositional environment with temporarily high water energy, either due to tidal currents or storm events. Nevertheless, the lack of fossils precludes common marine conditions. The presence of evaporite minerals, even though they may have formed as secondary phases, suggests hypersaline conditions during deposition. (3) Laminated dolomites agree with formation in a hypersaline coastal ephemeral lake or sabkha environment. The lamination has been interpreted as a result of layered microbial mats, but could be alternatively explained by periodically alternating sediment input. Diverse facies distribution reflects alternating ephermal lake/peritidal and subaerial vadose conditions in a transitional marine to terrestrial environment. Accordingly, the mode of dolomite formation is expected to have varied along with the environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{radiocarbon}} {{content and}} stable isotope {{composition of soil}} carbonate are best described by a dynamic system in which isotopic reequilibration {{occurs as a result}} of recurrent dissolution and reprecipitation. Depth of water penetration into the soil profile, as well as soil age, determines the degree of carbonate isotope reequilibration. We measured δ 13 C, δ 18 O and radiocarbon content of gravel rinds and fine (< 2 mm) carbonate in soils of 3. different ages (1000, 3800, and 6300 14 C yr B. P.) to assess {{the degree to which they}} record and preserve a climatic signal. In soils developing in deposits independently dated at 3800 and 6300 radiocarbon yr B. P., carbonate radiocarbon content above 40 cm depth suggests continual dissolution and reprecipitation, presumably due to frequent wetting events. Between 40 and 90 cm depth, fine carbonate is dissolved and precipitated as rinds that are not redissolved subsequently. Below 90 cm depth in these soils, radiocarbon content indicates that inherited, fine carbonate undergoes little dissolution and reprecipitation. In the 3800 - and 6300 -yr-old soils, δ 13 C in rind and fine carbonate follows a decreasing trend with depth, apparently in equilibrium with modern soil gas, as predicted by a diffusive model for soil CO 2. δ 18 O also decreases with depth due to greater evaporative enrichment above 50 cm depth. In contrast, carbonate isotopes in a 1000 -yr-old deposit do not reflect modern conditions even in surficial horizons; this soil has not undergone significant pedogenesis. There appears to be a lag of at least 1000 but less than 3800 yr before carbonate inherited with parent material is modified by ambient climatic conditions. Although small amounts of carbonate are inherited with the parent material, the rate of pedogenic carbonate accumulation indicates that Ca is derived primarily from eolian and rainfall sources. A model describing <b>carbonate</b> <b>input</b> and radiocarbon decay suggests that fine carbonate below 90 cm is mostly detrital (inherited) and that carbonate rinds have been forming pedogenically at a constant rate since alluvial fans were deposited. © 1994 Academic Press.

In the Brazos-Trinity Basin IV, the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of the interstitial water range from 0. 70917 to 0. 70954, with carbonates sharing similar or slightly lower values from 0. 70851 to 0. 70952. The interstitial water above 31 m shows similar 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio close to that of seawater, whereas the interstitial water below 31 m shows more radiogenic 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios, possibly indicating a water/rock interaction between the fluid and silicate component in the deep basin sediments. The Sr-isotope ratios of the carbonates are less radiogenic than the seawater, which may reflect a terrestrial <b>carbonate</b> <b>input</b> (such as limestone) transported through the Brazos and Trinity rivers. In the Ursa Basin, the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of the interstitial water range from 0. 70887 to 0. 70999, those of the carbonate vary from 0. 70808 to 0. 70930. Both the interstitial water and carbonate show a similar trend of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios throughout the depth. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of the interstitial water decrease from the sea floor surface to the minimum at the Seismic Reflector S 10. A lateral fluid incursion with less radiogenic 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios along the Seismic Reflector S 10 can be inferred in the Ursa Basin. It is suggested that the lateral fluid incursion shows a seawater origin, modified by diagenetic reactions including the dissolution of halite. Between the Seismic Reflector S 10 and S 40, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of the interstitial water increase linearly to the maximum. Along the Seismic Reflector S 40, a lateral fluid incursion with more radiogenic 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios is again recognized. The fluid may have also originated from seawater, but modified by the diagenesis of terrigenous sediments, likewise characterized by highly radiogenic 87 Sr/ 86 Sr compositions.

40|$|This work {{details for}} the first time the {{sedimentology}} of Les Monts de Baileux section. This section, located in a quarry between Chimay and Couvin, exposes a remarkable succession of strata from the top of the Jemelle Formation to the base of the Mont d’Haurs Formation. It therefore offers the opportunity to investigate the entire Hanonet, Trois- Fontaines and Terres d’Haurs formations, biostratigraphically from Polygnathus ensensis to P. timorensis conodont zones. This large lithostratigraphic thickness of clayley and argillaceous, and also pure limestones encompasses the Eifelian/ Givetian boundary in the lower part of Hanonet Formation, allowing a better understanding of the transition between the Eifelian which corresponds to a mixed siliciclastic-carbonate detrital ramp and the lower Givetian dominated by a carbonate rimmed shelf-related sedimentation. Petrographic study leads to the definition of 21 microfacies integrated into two palaeogeographical models. The first model (13 microfacies) is proposed for the Jemelle, Hanonet and Trois-Fontaines formations, i. e. P. ensensis Zone and almost entire P. hemiansatus Zone. In this platform model, the fore-reef environment is characterized by a high influence of storm events and <b>carbonate</b> <b>input</b> coming from proximal settings. The reef is mainly composed of an accumulation of stromatoporoids, crinoids, tabulate corals and rugose corals with a peloidal matrix. The back-reef area is dominated by agitated environments and calmer lagoons. Locally, less agitated conditions allow growth of massive and laminar organisms. The second model (6 microfacies) concerns the Terres d’Haurs Formation with the end of P. hemianstus Zone and significant part of the P. timorensis Zone. This ramp model is divided into a mid-ramp characterized by open-marine sedimentation interrupted by storm-related events and an inner ramp composed of ooidal shoals, back-shoal sedimentation and storm related deposits. Two other microfacies are fragmentarily defined for the Mont d’Haurs Formation, within the main P. varcus / P. rhenanus intervals. This unit was affected by strong dolomitization processes, where scarcity of well preserved, primary sedimentary fabrics is not favourable for designing of a microfacies-based model at all. The last part of the work concerns stratigraphic variations of magnetic susceptibility (MS). Values of mass MS of rocks were plotted and juxtaposed with semi-quantitative variation curves of microfacies. According to the prevailing magnitudes of MS, the relationships with two controlling parameters are evaluated: terrigenous influence (using the thin-section data on detrital quartz contents as proxies) and wave agitation (based on microfacies interpretation). The transgressive- regressive evolution of microfacies characteristics are compared with the juxtaposed trends in decreasing-increasing MS magnitudes. Approximately two thirds of this section suggests a good matching of the trends on generalized lithological and magnetic data. It is explained by common presence of clayey/silty impurities of slightly to moderately varying compositions which are greatly evidenced by means of thin-section studies and represent a principal and abundant paramagnetic component. The overall MS magnitudes actually show decreasing trends together with vigorous, eustatically driven sealevel rises. However, the remaining third of intervals in this section shows the rather complex than simple, equivocally or negatively arranged sequence/lithologic and MS stratigraphic trends. Peer reviewe...|$|E

These data are used to discriminate between the inputs of major cations and Sr from silicate and carbonate sources. Methods of estimating {{the proportion of the}} <b>carbonate</b> and silicate <b>inputs</b> to river waters using mixing arrays in Sr-Ca-Mg-Na-K 87 Sr/ 86 Sr space are shown to suffer from systematic correlations between the magnitude of the precipitation of secondary calcite and the fraction of the silicate component. This results in factor-of two overestimates of the fractions of silicate-derived Ca, Mg and Sr. To correct for this the magnitude of secondary calcite precipitated and relative fractions of silicate and carbonate-derived cations are instead calculated by modeling the displacement of water compositions from the compositions of the carbonate and silicate components of the bedload in subsets of Sr-Ca-Mg-Na-K 87 Sr/ 86 Sr space. The compositions of the carbonate and silicate end-members in the bedload are determined by sequential leaching. The results of this modeling are compared with modeling of the modal mineral inputs to waters where mineral compositions are derived from electronmicroprobe analyses of the minerals in the bedload. In the upper Marsyandi catchment, which drains low-grade Tethyan Sedimentary Series formations, a set of mainstem samples collected over a two-year period define tight correlations in Sr-Ca-Mg-Na-K- 87 Sr/ 86 Sr space. Modeling of the magnitude of secondary carbonate precipitation and fractions of silicate-derived Ca, Mg and Sr in Sr-Ca-Mg 87 Sr/ 86 Sr space gives selfconsistent results that are compatible with both the calculations of mineral modes {{and published}} Mg-isotopic compositions, if the ratio of chlorite to biotite weathering is high or if there is another silicate source of Mg. These calculations imply that between 12 and 31 percent of the Sr and 44 and 72 percent of the Mg is derived from silicate minerals where the range reflects the seasonal change in the ratio of silicate-derived to carbonate-derived cations. Modeling in Sr-Ca-Na and/or K space is inconsistent with the Sr-isotopic and Mg-isotopic constraints and we conclude that in this catchment dissolution of Na and K are incongruent relative to Sr-Ca-Mg. Potassium is preferentially retained in micas whereas the controls on Na are unclear. Modeling of the catchments underlain by High Himalayan Crystalline and Lesser Himalayan Series in Garhwal is complicated by the presence of dolomite as well as calcite in the carbonate and the results imply that dolomite dissolves faster in the acetic acid leaches than in nature. Up to 60 percent of the Sr in the catchment on High Himalayan Crystalline Series and 20 to 30 percent of Sr in the catchments on Lesser Himalayan Series are estimated to be derived from silicates. However {{it should be noted that}} the element budgets are not all self-consistent and the use of bedrock-element ratios to model the sources of chemical inputs to river waters remains subject to uncertainties...|$|R
40|$|This {{report was}} {{developed}} {{in accordance with the}} requirements in ''Technical Work Plan for: Regulatory Integration Modeling and Analysis of the Waste Form and Waste Package'' (BSC 2004 [DIRS 171583]). The purpose of the in-package chemistry model is to predict the bulk chemistry inside of a breached waste package and to provide simplified expressions of that chemistry as function of time after breach to Total Systems Performance Assessment for the License Application (TSPA-LA). The scope of this report is to describe the development and validation of the in-package chemistry model. The in-package model is a combination of two models, a batch reactor model that uses the EQ 3 / 6 geochemistry-modeling tool, and a surface complexation model that is applied to the results of the batch reactor model. The batch reactor model considers chemical interactions of water with the waste package materials and the waste form for commercial spent nuclear fuel (CSNF) waste packages and codisposed waste packages that contain both high-level waste glass (HLWG) and DOE spent fuel. The surface complexation model includes the impact of fluid-surface interactions (i. e., surface complexation) on the resulting fluid composition. The model examines two types of water influx: (1) the condensation of water vapor that diffuses into the waste package, and (2) seepage water that enters the waste package from the drift as a liquid. (1) Vapor Influx Case: The condensation of vapor onto the waste package internals is simulated as pure H 2 O and enters at a rate determined by the water vapor pressure for representative temperature and relative humidity conditions. (2) Water Influx Case: The water entering a waste package from the drift is simulated as typical groundwater and enters at a rate determined by the amount of seepage available to flow through openings in a breached waste package. TSPA-LA uses the vapor influx case for the nominal scenario for simulations where the waste package has been breached but the drip shield remains intact, so all of the seepage flow is diverted from the waste package. The chemistry from the vapor influx case is used to determine the stability of colloids and the solubility of radionuclides available for transport by diffusion, and to determine the degradation rates for the waste forms. TSPA-LA uses the water influx case for the seismic scenario, where the waste package has been breached and the drip shield has been damaged such that seepage flow is actually directed into the waste package. The chemistry from the water influx case that {{is a function of the}} flow rate is used to determine the stability of colloids and the solubility of radionuclides available for transport by diffusion and advection, and to determine the degradation rates for the CSNF and HLW glass. TSPA-LA does not use this model for the igneous scenario. Outputs from the in-package chemistry model implemented inside TSPA-LA include pH, ionic strength, and total <b>carbonate</b> concentration. These <b>inputs</b> to TSPA-LA will be linked to the following principle factors: dissolution rates of the CSNF and HLWG, dissolved concentrations of radionuclides, and colloid generation...|$|R

Bibliography: leaves 163 - 174. xiv, 174 l illus., maps, graphs, tablesCalcium {{carbonate}} sedimentation of the Southern California Continental Borderland can {{be examined}} {{by means of}} a budget. Carbonate transfer is the change in amount of calcium carbonate in the Borderland with time. Transfer can be divided into deposition, mechanical transfer other than deposition, biological transfer, and chemical transfer. Most Borderland carbonate deposition occurs on basin floors and basin slopes. Carbonate deposition in the Borderland is 125 x 10 ^ 10 g/yr. Aragonite and Mg-calcite percentage decrease with depth; dolomite percentage is a function of geographic coordinates (a response to source area). Total carbonate content of the sediments is independent of depth and geography. Potentially important forms of mechanical transfer include river influx, aerial transfer, and ocean current transfer. Of these, only river influx is an important 10 Borderland carbonate transfer process (16 x 10 ^ 10 g/yr). Aerial transfer cycles material produced in the Borderland without removing or adding significant amounts. Ocean currents may be important to intra-system transportation but not to transfer. River input is low Mg-calcite, with minor amounts of dolomite. Discussion of biological transfer includes only input. Biological input categories are shallow « 30 meters) rocky macrobentbos production, slope macrobenthos production, basin macrobenthos production, foraminifera production, and other production. Shallow rocky macrobenthos production is evaluated from estimates by divers of standing crop and from various estimates of turnover. This production amounts to 40 x 10 ^ 10 g/yr. Sandy shelf, slope, and basin macrobenthos production is 34 x 10 ^ 10 g/yr. Foraminifers production is 247 x 10 ^ 10 and other production is assumed to be 25 x 10 ^ 10 g/yr. Production by shallow rocky macrobenthos is particularly interesting, because this second-largest of the biological production processes occurs over only 1 per cent of the Borderland area. The total production Deep water flushing has is dominated by low Mg-calcite, with minor amounts of high Mg-calcite and aragonite. Chemical transfer involves solution on the basin floor, where waters are enriched with the solution 10 products of 400 x 10 ^ 10 g CaCO 3. been estimated by other workers to be biennial, so 200 x 10 ^ 10 g/yr is dissolved. Dolomite is not dissolved; the other carbonate minerals are dissolved to varying extent. Aragonite solution is diminished because only minor amounts of fine-grained aragonite are moved to deep water. Dissolved calcium input rate to the Borderland by rivers can account for 30 per cent of the annual calcium carbonate sedimentation. The remainder of the calcium must be extracted from ocean water flowing through the Borderland. Calcium carbonate production rate in temperate water shallow rocky bottom areas is comparable to tropical, non-reef production (about 500 (g/m^ 2) /yr). Coral reef production is about 10, 000 (g/m^ 2) /yr. Pelagic production is about 50 (g/m^ 2) /yr. Pelagic production rates over the world's oceans are capable of exceeding dissolved calcium supply rate of the world's rivers by an order of magnitude. The other two environments may also be able to match river supply of calcium. calcium carbonate is re-disso 1 ved. Excess Tertiary limestones of the Pacific coast of North America are generally either dominated by recognizable debris from one or two phyla or are fine-grained, impure limestones. Both characteristics might be expected of limestones forming in an area similar to the present Borderland. This investigation has demonstrated that considering the budget of <b>carbonate</b> <b>input</b> to and output from an area is an adequate method for enumerating processes controlling carbonate content of marine sediment...|$|E
