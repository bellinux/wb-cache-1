5|$|Once {{posted to}} France in December 1914, the Rhodesian Platoon almost {{immediately}} began suffering regular heavy casualties. Southern Rhodesian volunteers continued to arrive piecemeal in England throughout the conflict, so Rhodesian formations on the Western Front received regular reinforcements in small batches, but because casualties were usually concentrated in far larger groups it often {{took a few}} months for a depleted Southern Rhodesian unit to return to full numerical strength. A cycle developed whereby Rhodesian platoons in Belgium and France were abruptly decimated and then gradually built up again only to suffer the same fate on returning to action. When the KRRC's Rhodesian platoons took part in British offensives, they were easily recognised by a distinctive battle <b>cry</b> <b>that</b> their men shouted as they went over the top. Sometimes the British and German positions were so close that troopers on each front line could hear what was said in the opposite trench; one group of Southern Rhodesians avoided being understood in this situation by speaking a mixture of Shona and Sindebele (two African languages) instead of English.|$|E

25|$|By August 1, 2016, at {{approximately}} 3 AM, an endless live stream shot in negative lighting {{in what is}} allegedly a Brooklyn warehouse, sponsored by Apple Music began to surface on boysdontcry.co which appeared to show Ocean woodworking and sporadically playing instrumentals on loop. It later became clear that these instrumentals were from his upcoming visual album Endless; the full version {{is estimated to be}} 140 hours long. That same day, many news outlets reported that August 5, 2016 could be the release date for Boys Don't <b>Cry.</b> <b>That</b> date also turned out to be inaccurate, though in a Reddit AMA session, his collaborator Malay said that Ocean is a perfectionist, constantly tweaking things, and that his art cannot be rushed.|$|E

500|$|Contemporary Canadian art curator Diana Nemiroff {{suggested}} the controversy was {{largely due to}} the work being taken out of the larger context of the show. [...] "There's no doubt that the dress is a provocative object and it's meant to be a provocative object, but the <b>cry</b> <b>that</b> it's a waste of food is misplaced." [...] She noted that other exhibits have used grains, breads, and potatoes were used as part of previous exhibits, but the flesh was likely source of the controversy. Said Nemiroff: [...] "It's kind of double cross because clothing is supposed to be second skin and cover us up. And this one reverses the process and reveals what we don't want to confront: our mortality." ...|$|E

500|$|Two of {{the bridge}} players, Frederic Seward and William Sloper, {{accompanied}} Gibson and her mother to the lifeboats. The group boarded lifeboat no. 7, {{the first to be}} launched. Around 27 other people were on board the boat when it was lowered at 12:40am, just over an hour after the collision. The lifeboat's plug could not be found, causing water to gush in until, as Gibson later put it, [...] "this was remedied by volunteer contributions from the lingerie of the women and the garments of men." [...] Around 1,500 people were still aboard Titanic when she sank, throwing them into freezing water where they soon died of hypothermia. As they struggled in the water, Gibson heard what she described as a [...] "terrible <b>cry</b> <b>that</b> rang out from people who were thrown into the sea and others who were afraid for their loved ones." [...] The sinking deeply affected her; according to Sloper, she became [...] "quite hysterical and kept repeating over and over so that people near us could hear her, 'I'll never ride in my little grey car again.'" [...] The occupants of the lifeboat were finally rescued at 6:15am by the RMS Carpathia and taken to New York.|$|E

[...] Noting that [...] does not say [...] "their cry" [...] but [...] "her cry," [...] Rabbi Judah told {{that the people of}} Sodom issued a proclamation that anyone who gave a loaf of bread to the poor or needy would be burned. Lot's daughter Pelotit, the wife of a magnate of Sodom, saw a poor man on the street, and was moved with compassion. Every day when she went out to draw water, she smuggled all kinds of provisions to him from her house in her pitcher. The men of Sodom questioned how the poor man could survive. When they found out, they brought Pelotit out to be burned. She cried out to God to maintain her cause, and her cry ascended before the Throne of Glory. And God said (in the words of [...] ) [...] "I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to her <b>cry</b> <b>that</b> has come to Me." ...|$|E

The early nationalists were inspired by Swami Vivekananda, the foremost disciple of the Hindu mystic Sri Ramakrishna and helped by Sister Nivedita, disciple of the former.

2500|$|An {{important}} aspect of Johnson's singing was his use of microtonality. These subtle inflections of pitch help explain why his singing conveys such powerful emotion. Eric Clapton described Johnson's music as [...] "the most powerful <b>cry</b> <b>that</b> I think you can find in the human voice." [...] In two takes of [...] "Me and the Devil Blues" [...] he shows {{a high degree of}} precision in the complex vocal delivery of the last verse: [...] "The range of tone he can pack into a few lines is astonishing." [...] The song's [...] "hip humor and sophistication" [...] is often overlooked. [...] "enerations of blues writers in search of wild Delta primitivism," [...] wrote Wald, have been inclined to overlook or undervalue aspects that show Johnson as a polished professional performer.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{combines}} the downtuned riffs of nu metal/alternative metal with elements of New Jersey hardcore, hip hop, jazz and hard rock. Regarding the album's sound, rhythm guitarist Joey D'Amico remarked in September 2001 that [...] "the music is definitely emotional, but its hardcore in its roots". Songs such as [...] "Falling Down" [...] and [...] "Rejection" [...] feature a volatile brand of singing which frequently alternates between melodic crooning, rapping and more extreme vocal stylings. Jordan Plingos stated [...] "If somebody asks {{me what this}} band sounds like, I say 'go listen to 'Falling Down,' because it has everything. It starts off fast and heavy and brutal, and then, from the bridge and chorus to the end, it makes you <b>cry.</b> <b>That</b> song right there covers it all." ...|$|E

She was also influential in the conversion of Bob Marley, who then became internationally recognized. As a result, Rastafari became much better known {{throughout much of the}} world.

2500|$|Several of Desmond's lines, such as, [...] "All right Mr. DeMille, I'm {{ready for}} my close-up," [...] and [...] "I am big, it's the {{pictures}} that got small!" [...] are often quoted. Much of the film's wit is delivered through Norma Desmond's deadpan comments, which are often followed by sarcastic retorts from Gillis. Desmond appears to not hear some of these comments, as she is absorbed by her own thoughts and in denial, and so some of Gillis's lines are heard only by the audience, with Wilder blurring {{the line between the}} events and Gillis's narration. Gillis's response to Desmond's <b>cry</b> <b>that</b> [...] "the pictures got small" [...] is a muttered reply, [...] "I knew something was wrong with them". Wilder often varies the structure, with Desmond taking Gillis's comments seriously and replying in kind. For example, when the two discuss the overwrought script Desmond has been working on, Gillis observes, [...] "They'll love it in Pomona." [...] "They'll love it everyplace," [...] replies Desmond firmly.|$|E
2500|$|Basically, [...] "O Armatolos" [...] {{tells the}} story about the death of a legendary hero who {{protected}} the villagers from the gangs of Gheg Albanians (Ghegis). The action in the poem takes place {{in the middle of the}} 19th century in the western regions of Macedonia, respectively the region between Galichnik, Reka, and the village Stan (all in present-day Republic of Macedonia). Based on the motif of the folk songs about Kuzman Kapidan, the theme of the poem develops into nine parts. The first part, based on nine quatrains, tells about the statements of the tragic struggle and death of the hero Cosmas. In the second part, Cosmas' mother distressed expects her son's return from battle, not knowing that he died. The third part is the most striking piece in the poem, telling the <b>cry</b> <b>that</b> the enemies of the peasants caused by bringing the inanimate body of Cosmas into the village. It is in this part that the poem's most popular line [...] "screams can be heard from Galichnik in Reka" [...] is used, as an allusion to the sorrow of the people. In the fourth part, the author returns to the scenes of Cosmas' last battle and his demise. Through the fifth part, the attackers pay due respect to Cosmas by pledging not to attack his home village. Cosmas' mother removes the curse she had said towards the village enemies and forgives them, requiring the Gheg Albanians not to attack the Reka people any more. In the sixth part is seen the grieving of Cosmas' mother and through it is told the genealogical tree of the hero. This section notes Cosmas' lover Cveta, that washes the hero with her tears. The seventh part tells how the hero's mother orders the villagers to bury Cosmas and the other fighters together with all honors. The scene of the eight part takes place at the home of Cosmas' fiancee. Folk customs would refrain her from wailing over the death of Cosmas before her father. But as soon as she was left alone, her bitter cry echoed, forcing her to give up all thing earthly and become a nun. The ninth part marks the end of the piece, in which is marked the everlasting glory of Cosmas in the village.|$|E
