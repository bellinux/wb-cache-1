5|$|From the 1850s, {{the fossil}} remains of extinct large wolves were being {{found in the}} United States, {{and it was not}} {{immediately}} <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> all belonged to one species. The first specimen of what would later become associated with Canis dirus was found in mid-1854 in the bed of the Ohio River near Evansville, Indiana. The fossilized jawbone with cheek-teeth was obtained by the geologist Joseph Granville Norwood from an Evansville collector, Francis A. Linck. The paleontologist Joseph Leidy determined that the specimen represented an extinct species of wolf and reported it under the name of Canis primaevus. Norwood's letters to Leidy are preserved along with the type specimen (the first of a species that has a written description) at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. In 1857, while exploring the Niobrara River valley in Nebraska, Leidy found the vertebrae of an extinct Canis species that he reported the following year under the name C.dirus. The name C.primaevus (Leidy 1854) was later renamed Canis indianensis (Leidy 1869) when Leidy found out that the name C.primaevus had previously been used by the British naturalist Brian Houghton Hodgson for the dhole.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} and subsequent analysis of additional particles, both mesons and baryons, {{made it clear}} that the concept of isospin symmetry could be broadened to an even larger symmetry group, now called flavor symmetry.

The larger symmetry was named the Eightfold Way by Murray Gell-Mann, and was promptly recognized to correspond to the adjoint representation of SU(3). To better understand the origin of this symmetry, Gell-Mann proposed the existence of up, down and strange quarks which would belong to the fundamental representation of the SU(3) flavor symmetry.|$|E

25|$|There are differing {{estimates}} of the total capital held by Iranian expatriates. One estimate places the number at $1.3 trillion US dollars.

25|$|Since their {{discovery}} in 1873 {{there has been}} considerable debate about their origin. Three theories were dominant: from 1949 to 1970 the connective tissue origin was popular, which stated that osteoclasts and osteoblasts are of the same lineage, and osteoblasts fuse together to form osteoclasts. After years of controversy it is now <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> cells develop from the self fusion of macrophages. It was {{in the beginning of}} 1980 that the monocyte phagocytic system was recognized as precursor of osteoclasts. Osteoclast formation requires the presence of RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κβ ligand) and M-CSF (Macrophage colony-stimulating factor). These membrane-bound proteins are produced by neighbouring stromal cells and osteoblasts, thus requiring direct contact between these cells and osteoclast precursors.|$|E
25|$|The Hurrian of the Mitanni letter differs {{significantly}} from that {{used in the}} texts at Hattusha and other Hittite centres, {{as well as from}} earlier Hurrian texts from various locations. The non-Mitanni letter varieties, while not entirely homogeneous, are commonly subsumed under the designation Old Hurrian. Whereas in Mitanni the vowel pairs i/e and u/o are differentiated, in the Hattusha dialect they have merged into i and u respectively. There are also differences in morphology, some of which are mentioned {{in the course of the}} exposition below. Nonetheless, it is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> represent dialects of one language. Another Hurrian dialect is likely represented in several texts from Ugarit, but they are so poorly preserved that little can be said about them, save that spelling patterns used elsewhere to represent Hurrian phonemes are virtually ignored in them. There was also a Hurrian-Akkadian creole, called Nuzi, spoken in the Mitanni provincial capital of Arrapha.|$|E

500|$|According to Abdurakhman Avtorkhanov, [...] Nikita Khrushchev {{abolished}} the Ministry {{during the height}} of the Khrushchev Thaw in an attempt to restore the [...] "Leninist norms of socialist legality" [...] which had disappeared under Joseph Stalin's rule. Khrushchev tried to make the Soviet court more independent from central authority by enforcing the 1936 constitution on the country's judicial branch. This would, according to Khrushchev, give the courts further independence from the central authority.
