5|$|Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{neurological}} disorders after stroke, and affects at least 50million people worldwide. It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent unprovoked seizures. These occur when cortical neurons fire excessively, hypersynchronously, or both, leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function. This might affect, for example, the muscles, the senses, consciousness, or a combination. A seizure can be focal (confined to one part of the brain) or generalised (spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a loss of consciousness). Epilepsy may occur for a variety of reasons; some forms have been classified into epileptic syndromes, most of which begin in <b>childhood.</b> <b>Epilepsy</b> is considered refractory (not yielding to treatment) when two or three anticonvulsant drugs have failed to control it. About 60% of patients will achieve control of their epilepsy with the first drug they use, whereas about 30% do not achieve control with drugs. When drugs fail, other options include epilepsy surgery, vagus nerve stimulation and the ketogenic diet.|$|E
5|$|Syndromes {{in which}} causes are not clearly {{identified}} {{are difficult to}} match with categories of the current classification of epilepsy. Categorization for these cases was made somewhat arbitrarily. The idiopathic (unknown cause) category of the 2011 classification includes syndromes in which the general clinical features and/or age specificity strongly point to a presumed genetic cause. Some <b>childhood</b> <b>epilepsy</b> syndromes {{are included in the}} unknown cause category in which the cause is presumed genetic, for instance benign rolandic epilepsy. Others are included in symptomatic despite a presumed genetic cause (in at least in some cases), for instance Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Clinical syndromes in which epilepsy is not the main feature (e.g. Angelman syndrome) were categorized symptomatic but it was argued to include these within the category idiopathic. Classification of epilepsies and particularly of epilepsy syndromes will change with advances in research.|$|E

Twenty-one were otherwise normal children (idiopathic cases constituting what is now considered Panayiotopoulos syndrome), and 3 had symptomatic epilepsies. Half of the seizures were lengthy, lasting for hours (autonomic status epilepticus). The EEG of the 21 idiopathic cases showed great variations: 12 had occipital paroxysms or spikes alone or with extraoccipital spikes; 2 had central spikes and giantsomatosensory evoked spikes; 2 had midline spikes; 1 had frontal spikes; 1 had brief generalized discharges; and 3 had consistently normal EEG. Subsequent attention {{was focused on the}} predominant group with occipital spikes, which was established as [...] "early onset benign <b>childhood</b> <b>epilepsy</b> with occipital paroxysms". The other group of 9 children with extraoccipital spikes or normal EEGs was reevaluated much later; their clinical manifestations and outcome were similar to those patients with occipital spikes.

40|$|Purpose: Cases {{of severe}} <b>childhood</b> <b>epilepsies</b> in {{temporal}} association with vaccination have {{great impact on}} the acceptance of vaccination programs by parents and health care providers. However, {{little is known about}} the type and frequency of seizures and epilepsy syndromes following vaccination. This study aims to describe the clinical features of children presenting with seizures after vaccination using a register-based cohort. Methods: We surveyed the national German database of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) for reported seizures and epilepsies in children aged 0 - 6 years. All cases reported in 2006 - 2008 were analyzed retrospectively; available clinical information was reevaluated and classified by seizure type and epilepsy syndrome. Key Findings: In total, 328 cases reported between 2006 and 2008 were included. Data supportive of seizures or epilepsy were present in 247 (75. 3 %) of 328 patients with a mean interval between the vaccination and the epileptic event of 24 h and 7. 5 days for inactivated and attenuated vaccines, respectively. Fifty-one (15. 5 %) of 328 patients presented with syncope, hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes, or other nonepileptic events. Information was insufficient for classification into epileptic versus nonepileptic events in 30 (11. 3 %) of 328 patients. For cases with confirmed seizures, febrile seizures were present in 121 (49 %) of 247 cases, and 38 (15. 4 %) of 247 patients had single afebrile seizures. Status epilepticus was described in 21 (8. 5 %) of 247 patients. Thirty-one (12. 6 %) of 247 patients presented with various pediatric <b>epilepsy</b> syndromes. Severe <b>childhood</b> <b>epilepsies</b> (Dravet syndrome, West syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, or Doose syndrome) were diagnosed in 29 (11. 7 %) of 247 patients, with the vaccination-associated event being the first documented seizure in 15 (51. 7 %) of 29 patients. Significance: Vaccination-associated seizures present in the setting of various epilepsy syndromes, including severe <b>childhood</b> <b>epilepsies</b> in > 10 % of cases. Early diagnosis of the corresponding epilepsy syndromes and confirmation of an underlying etiology is important for treatment decisions, genetic counseling, and public health evaluation of vaccine safety...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{examine whether}} {{neighborhood}} deprivation increases {{the odds of}} hospital registration for <b>childhood</b> and adolescent <b>epilepsy,</b> after accounting for family- and individual-level sociodemographic characteristics. MethodsAn open cohort of all children aged 2 – 17 years was followed between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2010. Children's residential addresses were geocoded and classified according to neighborhood deprivation. Data were analyzed by multilevel logistic regression, with family- and individual-level characteristics at the first level and level of neighborhood deprivation at the second level. ResultsDuring the study period, among a total of 1, 020, 766 children, 9309 (0. 9 %) were registered with <b>childhood</b> and adolescent <b>epilepsy.</b> Age-adjusted cumulative hospital rates of <b>childhood</b> and adolescent <b>epilepsy</b> increased with increasing neighborhood-level deprivation across all family- and individual-level sociodemographic categories. The odds ratio (OR) for hospital registration for <b>childhood</b> and adolescent <b>epilepsy</b> for those living in high-deprivation neighborhoods versus those living in low-deprivation neighborhoods was 1. 15. High level deprivation remained significantly associated with higher odds of <b>childhood</b> and adolescent <b>epilepsy</b> after adjustment for family- and individual-level sociodemographic characteristics (OR= 1. 12, 95 % CI= 1. 04 – 1. 21, p= 0. 003).
