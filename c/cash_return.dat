40|$|We {{examine whether}} there are spatial {{relationships}} in U. S. production agriculture's profitability across regions and over time. We test the traditional view that factor markets (approximately) adjust to equalize agriculture's net returns over space and time using county-level data from the UDSA's Census of Agriculture, 1992 and 1997. We estimate Gini coefficients and calculate the Theil Entropy Measure (TMI) to examine changes in the concentration of returns over space and time, and to decompose the variation in inequality in returns due to between-region variation in returns. Although factor markets (approximately) adjust to equalize net returns over space and time, there is still considerable variability in returns within regions and within states. Use of county-level (Census of Agriculture) and farm-level data (ARMS Survey) to help highlight these differences. In general, farm-level Gini coefficients have remained fairly constant but show a mild increase in concentration since the 1996 FAIR Act. The TMI analysis reveals that in 1997 about 54 percent {{of the variation in}} total <b>returns</b> (net <b>cash</b> <b>returns)</b> was due to within-region variation, and about 46 percent was due to (average) between-region variation (compared to 53 and 47 percent in 1992).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} whether South African acquisitions result in success, with success measured as post-acquisition improvements in <b>cash</b> flow <b>returns.</b> The reason for this approach is the view that a firm's intrinsic value is coupled to its long-term cash-generating ability. Post-acquisition change in <b>cash</b> flow <b>returns</b> for large acquisitions made by JSE-listed firms over the period 1995 - 2009 were analysed. <b>Cash</b> flow <b>returns</b> were measured as free cash flow to the firm over capital employed. This measurement of <b>cash</b> flow <b>return</b> is neutral to the firm's financing decision and capital structure, thus facilitating a comparison between different firms. Changes in annual <b>cash</b> flow <b>returns</b> were measured over the period covering five years preceding and five years following completion of acquisitions. The <b>cash</b> flow <b>returns</b> of the acquiring firms were compared to benchmark returns of firms in the same sector which did not undertake major acquisitions. The study found in 22 of 24 tests that the benchmarked post-acquisition <b>cash</b> flow <b>returns</b> and EBITDA returns were not significantly different in relation to the benchmarked pre-acquisition returns. However, in two tests which adjusted for operating leases and used total returns over the pre-acquisition and post-acquisition periods, it was found that the difference in returns were significant. The sample of eleven firms is relatively small and any inferences about South African acquisitions in general should therefore be approached with care. The divergence in results between the individual firms within the sample, as well as the outlined sensitivities of observed results lend further support for this cautionary approach. Despite the limited number of acquisitions that occurred over the period, this study should contribute towards a better understanding of the overall value proposition of large South African acquisitions, as well as provide impetus for related future research...|$|R
