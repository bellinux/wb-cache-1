40|$|Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the development of <b>Computer</b> <b>Integrated</b> <b>Manufacturing</b> systems (<b>CIM)</b> and provides a vital link between Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM). Automatic extraction and recognition of part features directly from a CAD database also strengthen the link between CAD and CAPP. In this study, an automatic feature recognition and CNC code generation (AFR/ACCG) system was developed for rotational parts. This system was prepared using Delphi 7 programming language. The data input to the system is done by DXF (Drawing Interchange Format) prepared in any CAD programme. CNC part programme of the work piece to be produced is generated automatically as to machining features in this system. Sample parts were machined by the generated tool paths and part geometries were obtained accurately. All of the internal and external machining features of complex parts such as grooving, threading and boring can be defined automatically using this system by the nine determined elements.

40|$|Abstract- Machine {{vision has}} evolved {{to become a}} {{mainstream}} automation tool, enabling computers to replace human vision in high speed and precision manufacturing techniques. Images usually acquired through modern cameras may be contaminated {{by a variety of}} noise sources and decreasing intensity and in most cases the type of noise and state of lighting are also not known a priori. In this paper, the design of image operator for illumination enhancement and noise filtering using evolutionary approach is presented. The advantage of the proposed structure is that it is evolved from primitives. The evolvable hardware (EHW) configuration uses reconfigurable Xilinx Virtex 2 FPGA xc 4000 architecture. The developed image operator is tested for its performance by applying it on images of surfaces of machined components grabbed using vision systems with linearly decreasing intensity. The evolutionary enhanced image is then processed and a relationship between the feature of the surface image and the actual surface roughness is obtained using regression analysis. Comparing with the stylus method, the constructed computer vision system is useful method for measuring the surface roughness with faster, lower environment noise and lower price in <b>computer</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>manufacturing</b> process (<b>CIM)</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{classical}} Kyprianou's {{method was}} aimed to encode parts for group technology (GT). The purpose of GT is to systematically classify objects {{based on their}} manufacturing method. Kyprianou's work involved classifying faces into primary and secondary groups and then identifying features according to patterns of these primary or secondary faces. A primary face is one with multiple boundaries (also called [...] "hole-loops") or mixed concave and convex boundaries. A concave boundary {{is a set of}} concave edges, where the solid angle over the edge is more than 180. Secondary faces are all other faces. Kyprianou's work was continued and extended by Jared et al. to cover a number of important special cases where features interacted.Automatic Feature Recognition (AFR) is regarded as an ideal solution to automate design and manufacturing processes. Successful automation of CAD and CAM systems is a vital connection in building <b>Computer</b> <b>Integrated</b> <b>Manufacturing</b> (<b>CIM)</b> systems. This is the part of the FR research that has attracted much of the attention. Another important application of AFR is for manufacturability evaluation. The AFR system should be able to interpret the design differently based on alternative features and feed back the manufacturability and cost of those interpretations to the designer.There is a big stockpile of different AFR techniques that has been proposed for CAD/CAM integration and process planning. Han et al. provides a critical and detailed analysis of some of the existing approaches. The most common methods according to Han et al. range from graph-based algorithms to hint-based and volumetric decomposition techniques. In the graph-based feature recognition, a graph showing the topology of the part (connection of faces) is created. The graph is often attributed, for example the edges are marked as concave or convex. This graph is then analyzed to extract subsets of nodes and arcs that match with any predefined template. This is done by a variety of techniques, including graph iso-morphism algorithms.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{claims in}} recent {{research}} and popular business press {{that a number}} of attractive benefits can accrue through the use of <b>computer</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>manufacturing</b> systems (<b>CIM),</b> there has generally been only sporadic attempts to adopt and implement them. Case-oriented research using in-depth interviews with multiple respondents in three large corporations was performed during the period 1987 to early 1989; two of the corporations were users of these technologies and the third a vendor of CIM systems. The results of these interviews reinforce the preponderance of managerial and organizational issues over technological issues as a major barrier to effective implementation and use of CIM. Furthermore, the findings point out the prudence of an incremental approach to adoption and implementation of CIM to insure adequate corporate sponsorship. The significant cultural upheaval and organizational changes that occur with introduction of CIM-type technologies are critical factors to be recognized and managed. This exploratory case-based empirical study did not find support for a few of the other issues reported in past research to be problems such as lack of collaboration arrangement between the vendor of the systems and customer, or poor product-process fit or inadequate comparison of technological alternatives when embarking on CIM-type investments. Based on the findings from this study, a number of issues worthy of future research have been pointed out. <b>computer</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>manufacturing</b> adoption implementation critical success factors organizational issues strategic planning innovation...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} industry has undergone significant transformation {{during the past}} 25 years due to the increased cost of energy, increasingly stringent environmental regulations and global competition in product pricing and quality. The main objective of a process design {{is to create a}} process that is economical, safe, and environmentally benign throughout the whole lifetime of the plant. One of the most important engineering tools for addressing these issues is optimization. Modifications in plant design and operating procedures have been implemented to reduce costs and meet constraints, with an emphasis on improving efficiency and increasing profitability by using <b>computer</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>manufacturing,</b> or <b>CIM.</b> To apply optimization effectively in processing plant, both theory and practice of optimization must be understood. Appropriate meshing of the optimization technique and the model are essential for success in optimization.

Several algorithms have been proposed and large numbers of research applications have been presented. However, only a few applications have been reported with process simulation. This study presents a review of the concepts/application of optimization techniques. In addition, it discusses optimization software and process simulator that offers the most potential for successful and reliable results...|$|R
40|$|Current {{industrial}} production {{is driven by}} increasing globalization, {{which has led to}} a steady increase in production volumes and complexity of products aimed at the pursuit of meeting the needs of customers. In this context, one of the main tools in the management of customer value is Lean Manufacturing or Production, though it is considered primarily as a set of tools to reduce the total cost of the resources needed to achieve such needs. This philosophy has recently been enriched in the literature with case studies that link Lean Management (LM) with the improvement of environmental sustainability. The consequence is an expansion of the <b>Computer</b> <b>Integrated</b> <b>Manufacturing</b> (CIM); indeed, <b>CIM,</b> currently, combining and integrating the key business functions (e. g., business, engineering, manufacturing, and information management) {{with a view of the}} life cycle, does not highlight the strategic role of the environmental aspects. In order to deal with the increasingly rapid environmental degradation that is reflected in society, in terms of both economy and quality of life, Industrial Ecology (IE) introduced a new paradigm of principles and instruments of analysis and decision support (e. g., Life Cycle Assessment—LCA, Social Life Cycle Assessment -SLCA, Material Flow Account—MFA, etc.) that can be considered as the main basis for integrating the environmental aspects in each strategy, design, production, final product, and end of life management, through the re-engineering of processes and activities towards the development of an eco-industrial system. This paper presents the preliminary observations based on a analysis of both theories (LM-IE) and provides a possible assessment of the key factors relevant to their integration in a “lean environmental management”, highlighting both positives (lights) and possible barriers (shadows) ...|$|R
