5|$|The K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj conquered Zaculeu in the Postclassic. Traditionally {{that has}} been {{calculated}} as during the 15th century AD based on ethnohistoric accounts. Radiocarbon dating has pushed back the calculations of the K'iche' conquests by three centuries, and researchers now say their <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mam kingdoms may have taken place {{as early as the}} 12th century. The city was dominated by the K'iche' until the Spanish <b>Conquest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early 16th century.|$|E

5|$|Amundsen's initial plans {{had focused}} on the Arctic and the <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Pole {{by means of an}} {{extended}} drift in an icebound ship. He obtained the use of Fridtjof Nansen's polar exploration ship Fram, and undertook extensive fundraising. Preparations for this expedition were disrupted when, in 1909, the rival American explorers Frederick Cook and Robert E. Peary each claimed to have reached the North Pole. Amundsen then changed his plan and began to prepare for a <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South Pole; uncertain {{of the extent to which}} the public and his backers would support him, he kept this revised objective secret. When he set out in June1910, he led even his crew to believe they were embarking on an Arctic drift, and revealed their true Antarctic destination only when Fram was leaving their last port of call, Madeira.|$|E

25|$|When the Turkic peoples {{began their}} late medieval <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> Asia Minor, Byzantine Greek {{citizens}} were <b>the</b> largest group <b>of</b> indigenous peoples living there.

5|$|A {{year after}} González Dávila's {{discovery}} of the Gulf of Fonesca, various Spanish expeditions set out to conquer the territory of Honduras. These expeditions were launched southwards from Mexico and Guatemala, and northwards from Panama and Nicaragua; their rival captains clashed in Honduras, resulting in attempts at <b>conquest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natives being punctuated by battles between competing Spanish forces, and infighting within individual Spanish groups. The various Spanish groups also fielded indigenous auxiliaries to support their efforts.|$|E

50|$|His work is {{an almost}} {{invaluable}} source as arguably the earliest Arab account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Islamic <b>conquests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> countries it deals with.
