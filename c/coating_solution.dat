An organic solvent, ethanol, was added to the <b>coating</b> <b>solution</b> to decrease the conductivity of the <b>coating</b> <b>solution</b> so that hydrogen bubble formation/bursting reduces during the CaP coating process. Experimental results confirmed that ethanol addition to the <b>coating</b> <b>solution</b> reduces the conductivity of the solution and also decreases the hydrogen evolution/bubble bursting.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of hydro-alcohol coating solvent ratio on the surface texture and lag time of porous theophylline osmotic tablet. Methods: Porous theophylline osmotic pump tablets were formulated by direct compression and coated by spraying with varying ratios of water-alcohol containing hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC, 5 cps) as primary swelling layer and Eudragit ® RSPO and RLPO as porous layer. The viscosity of HPMC <b>coating</b> <b>solution</b> was determined using Brookfield viscometer. Surface morphology was investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In vitro drug release studies to assess lag time was performed in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF).

SEM revealed profound distortions in coating texture with a high proportion of either solvent in the <b>coating</b> <b>solution.</b> Increasing the amount of either water or alcohol in the <b>coating</b> <b>solution</b> increased the roughness of coated surface which contributed to a burst release of drug due to early opening of the tablet as a result of the high osmotic pressure and low mechanical strength of the coated layer.

The corresponding bonded specimens were investigated using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy to monitor their chemical composition, infrared imaging to control bond integrity, and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy to study their microstructure. Their interfacial fracture energy was measured using microindentation. An optimum water-to-alkoxide molar ratio of 10 and hydrolysis water at pH = 2 were found.

40|$|The {{sol-gel process}} is an {{extensively}} used method {{to prepare the}} various coating and films {{because it has a}} many advantages according to other film formation methods, such as low temperature processing, easy coating of large surfaces, good adhesion ability to surface of film or coating, homogeneous oxide film formation, and adjustment of film composition and porosity. Solgel thick films are not appropriate for the sensor applications because they may block the diffusion of electro-active analyte through the film.

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of mesopores into silica films {{is an effective}} way to reduce the dielectric constant. However, the pores reduce the film mechanical strength. This study investigates two steps for preparing <b>coating</b> <b>solution.</b> One was the reflux of the silica colloid at 70 ℃. The other was the addition of TPAOH (tetrapropylammonium hydroxide) into the colloid. The reflux step can increase the mechanical strength, reduce the flat band voltage and reduce the leakage current of the films. Nevertheless, the low-k value (k represents dielectric constant) increases as the porosity of the film falls. Adding a slight amount of TPAOH before the reflux process can recover both the porosity and the low k value, while maintaining the high mechanical strength and the low flat band voltage. Results of this study demonstrate that two more steps (the addition of TPAOH and the reflux) in the preparation of the <b>coating</b> <b>solution</b> can increase the film hardness and elastic modulus from 0. 8 to 1. 4 GPa and from 5. 8 to 9. 9 GPa respectively, while maintaining the low-k value close to 2. 05. ...|$|E
40|$|The double-gyroid {{phase of}} {{nanoporous}} silica films formed by evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) {{has been shown}} to possess facile mass-transport properties and may be used as a robust template for the nanofabrication of metal and semiconductor nanostructures. Recently, we developed a new synthesis of double-gyroid nanoporous silica films where the aging time of the <b>coating</b> <b>solution</b> prior to EISA was the key parameter required to control the interfacial curvature that results upon self-assembly of the film. Here, we use Si- 29 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to investigate the nanoscale structure of the coating solutions used to obtain double-gyroid nanoporous silica films. NMR and SAXS were carried out on the water, ethanol, silica, and poly(ethylene oxide) -b-poly(propylene oxide) -b-alkyl (EO 17 -PO 12 -C- 14) surfactant coating solutions as well as similar solutions that excluded either the silica or the surfactant. NMR data reveal that the silica monomers in the <b>coating</b> <b>solution</b> condense very rapidly to form rings and connected ring species. After 1 day of aging, all monomers and dimers have disappeared, and the distribution is dominated by Q(2) and Q(3) species, where the superscript in Q(n) describes the number of silicon atoms in the second coordination shell of the central silicon. Over {{the course of the next}} 9 days, the Q(3) population slowly rises at the expense of the Q(2) and Q(3 t) populations. Absolute intensity SAXS measurements reveal that the size of the silica clusters increases steadily during this aging period, reaching an average radius of gyration of 9. 0 A after 9 days of aging. Longer aging results in the continued growth of clusters with a mass fractal dimension of 1. 8. Absolute intensity SAXS data also reveals that micelles are not present in the <b>coating</b> <b>solution.</b> At 9 % volume fraction of surfactant, the <b>coating</b> <b>solution</b> is far above the aqueous critical micellar concentration. However, even a small amount of ethanol inhibits micellization. SAXS data also shows that when surfactant is present the radius of gyration is larger but increases more slowly. This indicates that there are weak associative interactions between the silica clusters and surfactant in solution that reduce the cluster-cluster growth rate. In part II of this work, we use the results discovered here to interpret the effects of aging on interfacial curvature in the nanostructured films that self-assemble from these solutions...|$|E
