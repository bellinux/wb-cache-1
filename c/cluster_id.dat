In this work we explore using the labeled data in one language to perform part-of-speech tagging of data in another language. In specific, we use dependency structure to transfer part-of-speech knowledge from an annotated source corpus to a non-parallel target corpus in another language. This work {{is in contrast to}} other notable work in multilingual part-of-speech tagging which uses parallel corpora to transfer part-of-speech knowledge [3]. To accomplish the knowledge transfer, along with the annotated source corpus, we use an unsupervised part-of-speech tagger based on Gibbs sampling inference of a graphical model. Like the model presented in [1], our model also relies on annotations that provide the sentence dependency structure of the data 1. There are three main aspects to our approach. First, we perform preliminary unsupervised part-of-speech tagging of the target corpus. This stage results in an assignment of <b>cluster</b> <b>ids</b> to each token in the target corpus. Next we find a mapping between the tags of the source tagset and the tagset of the target corpus. Finally, we transfer the counts (for example, the transition counts) from the annotated source corpus to the target corpus via the mapping and use them to improve the tagging of the target corpus and also to give meaning to the unsupervised <b>cluster</b> <b>ids.</b> In practice, however, the second and third components can b...|$|R

All similarity measure approaches are outlined in this thesis, but only one was selected for determining similarity in this approach. Based on a partitioning of the rule space, this approach uses lo and h with their inherent primitives p 0 and pi to obtain a cluster identification string [5], The <b>cluster</b> <b>Id.</b> is determined by the output of the surrounding neighbors of any rule in the cluster.

Isolating influence in observational data is difficult, because we may observe that con-nected people discuss the same topic in proximate periods for reasons other than influence, in-cluding homophily–connected people are similar–and exogenous shock; they may have learned of the topic from some external source. We employ a matched sample estimation technique that has been used in the past to measure influence by controlling for demographic and usage based homophily, and add to the matching scheme a <b>cluster</b> <b>ID.</b> Our contribution is two-fold: First, we provide preliminary evidence that social network-based clusters capture homophily, indicating that a network-based attribute approach may not only capture homophily but also may be used in lieu of using demographic attributes for matching similar users in scenarios when privacy preservation is a concern. Second, we show that by adding a network position attribute, a <b>cluster</b> <b>ID,</b> when matching similar users, we can isolate influence better.

All infected calves in this experiment developed respiratory symptoms and seroconverted to BVDV positivity. Contact calves also contracted a respiratory tract infection following exposure to infected animals. Viremia was demonstrated between postinfection days 2 and 17, and the virus was detected in organ specimens of all but one each of the infected and contact calves. In experiment 2, the distribution of BVDV in various tissues of calves euthanized at defined days postinfection was studied. In two of these calves recurrent shedding of BVDV in nasal secretions was shown. BVDV was detected in various tissues of all infected calves throughout the experiment and also following seroconversion and the clearance of BVDV from the circulatory system. Despite the widespread distribution of the virus in various organs, significant tissue damage was found mainly in respiratory tract and lymphoid tissues. These experiments revealed that viruses from <b>cluster</b> <b>Id</b> of BVDV are able to induce primary respiratory disease in previously seronegative, immunocompetent calves.

The backbone is used to collect control traffic and to reduce overhead for route discovery. VSR uses clusters to define a route as a list of <b>cluster</b> <b>IDs.</b> This <b>cluster</b> topology is more stable than the physical topology. Hence, routes are more robust.

30|$|In {{order to}} execute the algorithm, each vehicle is assumed to {{maintain}} and update the two sets Γ(t) and the Λ(t) that contain the IDs of the 2 r-stable neighbors. At any time, {{there should be a}} vehicle whose speed is the slowest among its 2 r-stable neighbors, and as a result, the Λ(t) list maintained by this vehicle is empty. The pseudo code of the algorithm is shown in Algorithms 1 - 3. The algorithm basically requires that the slowest vehicle or the vehicle whose Λ(t) members belong to other clusters originates the cluster formation process. This vehicle is called the cluster originating vehicle (COV). Line 3 in Algorithm 1, shows that COV sends the Initiate Cluster(CIDtmp) with its ID as a temporary <b>cluster</b> <b>ID</b> to all Γ(t). Then, as shown in Algorithm 2, all Γ(t) non-clustered members react upon receiving this message by setting their <b>cluster</b> <b>ID</b> temporarily to be the ID of the COV as shown in line 3. Vehicles start calculating their suitability to become a CH as shown in line 4. Then, the vehicle calculates Twait before announcing its eligibility to become a cluster-head as shown in line 5. The vehicle waits for Twait that is proportional to the suitability value of the vehicle. The higher the suitability value, the less the value of Twait. This can be seen in lines 6 through 15. If the vehicle receives a Form Cluster(CHid) message from any other vehicle that belongs to Γ(t) before its waiting time, Twait, expires, then the vehicle determines that there are other vehicles belong to Γ(t) that are more suitable to win the CH role. Therefore, the vehicle quits the competition and processes the received message.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{limitations}} of using OFDM technique is its higher PAPR in the time domain signal. The higher PAPR OFDM signal would cause the fatal degradation of BER performance and undesirable spectrum regrowth in the nonlinear channel. One of the promising PAPR reduction methods for OFDM signal is the Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS) method which can achieve better PAPR performance with reasonable computation complexity. However the PTS method is required to inform the phase coefficients of PTS as the side information to the receiver for the correct demodulation of data information through the data or separate channels. To simplify the transceiver of OFDM system with the PTS method, the phase coefficients of PTS are usually embedded in the data information. However since the phase coefficients of PTS are obtained after the PTS processing only for the data information at each OFDM symbol, it is hard to embed the phase coefficients of PTS in the data information separately without degradation of PAPR performance. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new PAPR reduction method based on the packet-switched transmission systems in which all the clusters within the certain number of OFDM symbols have the sequential <b>cluster</b> <b>ID</b> numbers embedded in the header of each cluster. The salient features of the proposed method are to reduce the PAPR performance by re-ordering of clusters (ROC) in the frequency domain at the transmitter and to reconstruct the original ordering of clusters by using the <b>cluster</b> <b>ID</b> number demodulated from each cluster at the receiver. This paper also proposes a reduction technique of computation complexity for the proposed ROC method by using the feature of IFFT processing.
