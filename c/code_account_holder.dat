Following an investigation, the Indian Government informed the Supreme Court on 10 December 2010 that the Income Tax department had found that 18 of the <b>account</b> <b>holders</b> had evaded taxes by depositing [...] in their LGT Bank accounts. The IT Department issued a total fine of [...] the 18 <b>account</b> <b>holders.</b> On 4 July 2011, the Supreme Court ordered the Government to disclose the names of all 26 <b>account</b> <b>holders</b> to the public. The Government attempted to stall the Supreme Court order, but eventually disclosed the names of the 18 <b>account</b> <b>holders</b> who had been fined on 29 April 2014. However, the Government refused disclose the names of the remaining 8 <b>account</b> <b>holders</b> against whom no action was taken.|$|R

A 24-hour Pass, for example, is charged at a flat rate, but an <b>account</b> <b>holder</b> pays per trip. <b>Account</b> <b>holders</b> who make multiple trips {{in a single day}} may pay more than a pass customer would. However, CityLink recognises this and account customers can remove their e-TAG device and buy a pass for the day: just like casual customers.

That is, the <b>account</b> <b>holders</b> transfer money into the DMT network, which becomes the legal owner of the money. Then, the <b>account</b> <b>holder</b> can make a private DMT transfer to another account in the system.

40|$|Backup {{authentication}} mechanisms help {{users who}} have forgotten their passwords regain {{access to their}} accounts—or at least try. The security and reliability of today’s backup authentication mechanisms have significant room for improvement. We designed, built, and tested a new authentication system that employs social-authentication. The system employs trustees previously appointed by the <b>account</b> <b>holder</b> to verify the <b>account</b> <b>holder’s</b> identity. We ran three experiments {{to determine whether the}} system could (1) reliably authenticate <b>account</b> <b>holders,</b> (2) resist email attacks that target trustees by impersonating <b>account</b> <b>holders,</b> and (3) resist phone-based attacks from individuals close to <b>account</b> <b>holders.</b> Results were encouraging: seventeen of the nineteen participants who made the effort to call trustees authenticated successfully. However, we also found that users must be reminded of who their trustees are. While email-based attacks were largely unsuccessful, stronger countermeasures will be required to counter highly-personalized phone-based attacks...|$|R

40|$|Islamic {{banks are}} exposed to a unique risk such as Displaced Commercial Risk (DCR). DCR arises from the assets managed {{on behalf of the}} {{investment}} <b>account</b> <b>holders</b> which may be borne by the Islamic bank’s own capital, when the Islamic banks forgo part or all of its share of profits on the investment <b>account</b> <b>holders</b> funds, in order to increase the return to the investment <b>account</b> <b>holders.</b> In a dual banking system, DCR could be a threat to the Islamic banks given the competition of fixed and higher return from the conventional banks. How-ever, DCR would not be a threat to Islamic banks if their <b>account</b> <b>holders</b> choose Islamic banks due to religious obligatory factor. Pertaining to this issue, this paper aims to identify the determinants of factors influencing the DCR among the Islamic banks in the case of Malaysia. Results of the study suggest that the DCR is signifi-cantly determined by the Investment <b>account</b> <b>holder</b> funds, Islamic deposit, rate of return, and interest rate...|$|R

5000|$|The use {{of checks}} in a scam {{hinges on the}} {{practice}} or law in many countries concerning checks: when an <b>account</b> <b>holder</b> presents a check for deposit, the bank will usually make the funds available to the <b>account</b> <b>holder</b> within 1-5 business days, although checks, particularly if international, may take longer than that to clear. The clearing process may take 7-10 days, and {{can take up to}} a month when dealing with foreign banks.
