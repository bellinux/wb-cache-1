40|$|The partial defence of {{provocation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} <b>controversial</b> <b>doctrines</b> within the criminal law. It has now been abolished in a number of international jurisdictions. Addressing the trajectory of debates about reform of the provocation defence across different jurisdictions, Sex, Culpability and the Defence of Provocation considers the construction and representation of subjectivity and sexual difference in legal narrations of intimate partner homicide. Undeniably, the most vexing exculpatory cultural narrative of our times is that of a woman 2 ̆ 7 asking for it 2 ̆ 7. This book explores how the process of judgment in a criminal trial involves not only the drawing of inferences from the facts of a particular case, but also operates to deliver a narrative. Law, it is argued, constructs a narrative of how the female body incites male violence. And, pursuing an approach that is informed by socio-legal studies, literary theory and feminist theories of the body, Sex, Culpability and the Defence of Provocation considers how this narrative is constructed via a range of discursive practices that position woman as a threat to masculine norms of propriety and autonomy. Once we have a clear understanding of the significance of narrative in legal decision-making, we can then formulate textual strategies of resistance to the violence of law 2 ̆ 7 s victim-blaming narratives by rewriting them...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Divine {{election}} {{is certainly one}} of the more profound and <b>controversial</b> <b>doctrines</b> of religions, in every Holy Scripture and beyond. It certainly helped many wandering people, ranging from a place to another, in slavery, poverty or ousted by other. Also, it helped maintain loyalty to traditions; it brings hope for poor and meek, it implies divine protection and helps overcome the most severe social handicaps. The conception of chosenness has at the same time negative appointment regarding the others, non-chosen, and so it leads to moral and eschatological debates and paradoxes. How the most known religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—relate to this concept, and what is their interpretation of this profound concept, we will try to build on the relationship of pilgrim people, expelled and ousted. For the biblical interpretation of the concept, we will see it as a separation among others but also with a special call in relation with them. The Christian side of it aimed at the beginning against the ultra nationalistic view of chosenness as in Judaism, then it gained the same facet as Israel, within the concept of predestination. For the Islamic part, the concept borrowed some issues from both previous religions, but also set its vision and application of it. What are the differences and mostly the circumstances that led to such conceptions—we will see during this paper. KEY WORDS: jealousy, chosenness, elected people, hope, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, religious leaders, covenant, ousted, sovereignty, predestination, theopolitical nation...|$|E
40|$|Market-share {{liability}} {{has been}} one of the most <b>controversial</b> <b>doctrines</b> in tort law, with a strong plurality of courts rejecting the doctrine on the ground that it radically departs from the fundamental principle of causation. Courts that have adopted this liability rule, though, believe they are adhering to the principle of causation. In the first case to adopt market-share liability, the California Supreme Court claimed that the liability rule is grounded upon an extension of alternative liability, a doctrine that has been accepted by virtually all jurisdictions. The court never adequately explained how alternative liability can be modified to yield market-share liability, and the only explanation provided by torts scholars involves redefining the tort right to permit compensation for tortious risk, conditional upon the occurrence of injury, rather than for the injury itself. However, courts do not conceptualize the tort right in these terms, for otherwise the doctrine of market-share liability would be uncontroversial. As this Article shows, market-share liability can be derived from alternative liability in a manner that neither redefines the tort right nor departs from the principle of causation. Alternative liability permits the plaintiff to prove causation against the group of defendants. This characterization of the causal rule has been recognized by some torts scholars, but has never been justified. The Article shows that evidential grouping is a defensible principle implicit in numerous cases involving analogous causal problems, including the asbestos cases. Evidential grouping not only explains the doctrine of alternative liability, it shows how a modification of that liability rule yields market-share liability largely for reasons given by the California Supreme Court. This conceptualization of alternative liability and market-share liability also explains the otherwise puzzling liability rule adopted by courts in the asbestos cases. Due to this doctrinal unity, the widespread acceptance of alternative liability should make market-share liability more widely acceptable...|$|E
40|$|Disparate {{impact theory}} {{is a vital}} tool for fair housing advocates. It allows them to {{challenge}} institutional behaviors that harm minority groups and municipal practices that perpetuate long-standing segregated patterns, {{without having to go}} through the difficult process of identifying a specific bad actor with explicitly discriminatory motives. Disparate impact theory has been a failure for fair housing advocates. It is overly complicated, infrequently used, and seldom leads to plaintiff success. Moreover, the availability of this theory has led to the underdevelopment of the law surrounding intentional discrimination, which has ultimately made all cases with circumstantial evidence more difficult to prove. According to respected commentators, all of the previous statements are true. Suffice it to say, this theory {{is one of the most}} theoretically significant, misunderstood, and <b>controversial</b> <b>doctrines</b> to arise in the area of antidiscrimination law. There is now a greater urgency to this debate, because disparate impact theory in the fair housing context is facing an existential threat: The Supreme Court is currently considering whether disparate impact theory is cognizable under the Fair Housing Act. Through this essay, I seek neither to praise disparate impact theory nor to bury it. Rather, I endeavor to make use of this particular legal moment to interrogate the doctrine and its application to fair housing cases. I begin with the assumption that disparate impact theory in housing is destined either for extinction or to continue on its current underperforming state. In light of these two, unsatisfactory outcomes, we must ask: What benefits does disparate impact add? If it is not achieving its hoped-for results, how can it be improved? If it is to be eliminated, how can advocates achieve these benefits through other means? Put another way: How can fair housing advocates move beyond disparate impact, at least as it currently exists...|$|E
