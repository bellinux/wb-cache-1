40|$|Simazine {{loss from}} soil to surface runoff water produce both a {{decrease}} in the effectiveness of the soil chemical treatment and a water quality hazard in receiving waters. Simazine has been found in 30 % of wells sampled in Fresno and Tulare counties, California and some contamination has been attributed to simazine use in citrus orchards. Contamination of receiving water from herbicides could put important weed control tools at risk and potentially increase risks to human health. In order to better understand the off-site movement of herbicides, studies were conducted in citrus orchards to evaluate weed control efficacy under selected weed management practices and to measure selected management practices for mitigating preemergent herbicide movement in rainfall runoff from citrus orchard middles. The results showed weed management practices that avoid broadcast application of preemergent herbicides during the rainy season were as effective as the standard rate at 2. 0 lb ai /acre for weed control by using spray application to the entire orchard floor. The most common weed species included: spotted spurge, common groundsel, horseweed, annual sowthistle, and purple <b>cudweed.</b> <b>Common</b> groundsel is found to be resistant to preemergence application. Modifying how preemergence herbicides are used to control weeds is becoming increasingly important to protect th...|$|R

50|$|The copse lies on Greensand and {{the soil}} is acidic. The main trees are mature oaks and hazel; there are also bluebells. A {{considerable}} number of trees were blown down in the 1987 storm. Replanting took place in 1991. Arable and pastoral land surrounds the copse. On {{the fringes of the}} copse there is a considerable amount of <b>Common</b> <b>Cudweed</b> but generally the copse is species poor.|$|E
