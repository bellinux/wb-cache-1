40|$|<b>Classifying</b> host roles {{based on}} network traffic {{behavior}} is valuable for network security analysis and detecting security policy violation. Behavior-based network security analysis has advantages over traditional approaches such as code patterns or signatures. Modeling host roles based on network flow data is challenging {{because of the}} huge volume of network traffic and overlap among host roles. Many studies of network traffic classification have focused on <b>classifying</b> applications such as web, peer-to-peer, and DNS traffic. In general, machine learning approaches have been applied on <b>classifying</b> applications, security awareness, and anomaly detection. In this paper, we present a supervised machine learning approach that use On-Line Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree to <b>classify</b> host roles.

We <b>classify</b> different roles, namely, clients versus servers, regular web non-email servers versus web email servers, clients at personal offices versus public places of laboratories and libraries, and personal office clients from two different colleges.
