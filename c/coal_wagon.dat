5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, the hospital, {{under the control}} of the Hailsham Hospitals Management Committee since the 1948 {{establishment}} of the National Health Service, decided to convert its boilers from coal to oil. The railway was therefore no longer needed to transport coal; the last load was delivered on 10March 1959, and the empty <b>coal</b> <b>wagon</b> returned to Hellingly on 25March 1959.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the {{agreement}} between the hospital authorities, the LBSCR, and its successors, the hospital authorities were obliged to keep the railway in good repair to allow its use by main-line wagons. With a greatly reduced need for goods traffic to the hospital following the conversion of the boilers, it was decided that the railway was not worth the expense of continued maintenance and necessary upgrading, and the line was officially closed on 25March 1959 following the departure of the last <b>coal</b> <b>wagon.</b>|$|E

25|$|On May 24, 1874, a {{large crowd}} of St. Louisans were {{permitted}} on the roadway deck, and in June the bridge's weight limits were tested using a <b>coal</b> <b>wagon,</b> a train, and an elephant. On July 2, 1874, fourteen locomotives loaded with coal pulled onto each span, putting to rest concerns about the bridge's safety. Two days later, {{as part of the}} city's Independence Day celebrations, the bridge opened with a parade and a crowd in excess of 200,000. Costs for the bridge exceeded estimates, reaching $6.5 million for labor, land, and supplies, which increased to $9 million when including bond interest. A 5,000-foot tunnel connecting the bridge with the St. Louis railroad yards and costs to modify streets were approximately $2 million.|$|E
500|$|A similar crash {{occurred}} at Lawrence Hill on 1 November 2000, when a Royal Mail train passed two red signals {{and ran into}} the back of a coal train at around 3:30am. The mail train, hauled by English Welsh & Scottish [...] diesel locomotive number 67002 [...] "Special Delivery", with 67012 at the rear, was travelling at 50mph when the incident occurred. The locomotive climbed over the back of the coal train, coming to rest [...] later on top of a <b>coal</b> <b>wagon</b> and against the A420 Church Road bridge. The driver of the mail train suffered a broken arm and cuts to the face and chest, but there were no other injuries. The incident was initially suspected to be caused by faulty brakes, but was later found to be caused by misunderstanding and incorrect use of the locomotive's BPPCUIC cock by railway staff.|$|E
2500|$|But Shea {{was not an}} {{advocate}} of sympathy strikes, not even when they meant one unit of Teamsters would be supporting another unit of Teamsters. In November 1903, Teamsters employed by the Chicago City Railway went out on strike. Shea attempted to stop sympathy strikes by other Teamster locals in the city but failed. However, three Teamster locals in the city—the truck, ice wagon, and <b>coal</b> <b>wagon</b> drivers, which together represented about half the Teamster membership in Chicago—refused to violate their contracts and walk off the job. The three locals went even further, and disaffiliated from the Teamsters Joint Council of Chicago. Furious, Shea called them [...] "cowards and traitors". [...] His outburst only angered his opponents in the union. In mid-December, Shea was confronted in his office by Teamster leader who shot at him four times and forced him to dance a jig before fleeing.|$|E

2500|$|With the Down loop occupied, {{night shift}} {{signalman}} Meakin decided to shunt the local passenger train onto the Up main line. At {{this point the}} southbound empty coal train {{was standing at the}} Up Home signal to the north of Quintinshill, and accordingly it was still occupying the section from Kirkpatrick (the next signalbox to the north). [...] This meant that signalman Meakin had not yet telegraphed Kirkpatrick the [...] "train out of section" [...] signal for the empty coal train, and he could not send the [...] "blocking back" [...] signal to advise the Kirkpatrick signalman that the local train was standing on the Up main line. [...] Once the local train had crossed onto the Up main line, Meakin allowed the empty <b>coal</b> <b>wagon</b> train to proceed into the Up loop. [...] Arriving late aboard the local train, the early day shift signalman Tinsley reached Quintinshill signalbox shortly after 6.30 am. At 6.34 am one of the signalmen (it was never established which) gave the [...] "train out of section" [...] bell to Kirkpatrick for the coal train. At this point, two crucial failures in signalling procedure occurred (see Rules breaches).|$|E
