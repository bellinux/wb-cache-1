50|$|A molly or molly bolt, often misspelled moly, is a {{formerly}} trademarked {{name for}} a specialized screw fastener used with drywall, as a hollow-wall anchor. Larger sizes permit reasonably heavy objects, such as shelving, flatscreen-TV mounts or <b>central-heating</b> <b>radiators</b> to be attached to drywall in locations {{where there is no}} stud behind the drywall. For heavy objects, multiple molly bolts may be required.|$|E
40|$|An {{approximate}} {{analytical model}} {{has been used to}} evaluate the optimum dimensions of a <b>central-heating</b> <b>radiator.</b> The radiator problem is divided into three one-dimensional fin problems and then the temperature distributions within the fins and heat-transfer rate from the radiator are obtained analytically. The optimum geometry maximizing the heat-transfer rate for a given radiator volume and the geometrical constraints associated with production techniques, and thermal constraints have been found. The effects of geometrical and thermal parameters on the radiator's performance are presented. Central heating Optimization Radiators...|$|R
