40|$|The thesis {{provides}} the first overall {{history of the}} World Bank Group’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) and of its <b>constituent</b> <b>treaty,</b> the 1965 Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States. The thesis traces the immediate origins of the Convention, in the years 1955 to 1962, and gives a stage-by-stage narrative of the drawing up of {{the text of the}} Convention between 1962 and 1965. Next recounted are details of bringing the Convention into force in 1966 and the elaboration of the initial versions of the Regulations and Rules of ICSID adopted at the first meetings of its Administrative Council in 1967. The three periods 1968 to 1988, 1989 to 2000 and the 2000 s up until June 30, 2010, are covered in subsequent chapters of the thesis. Examined in these chapters are expansions of the Centre’s activities and changes made to the Regulations and Rules over the years. Also furnished in these chapters are overviews of the conciliation and arbitration cases submitted to ICSID in the respective periods. The overviews are followed by in-depth discussions of selected cases and key issues in them. The concluding chapter discusses some of the broad themes and findings of the thesis and several suggestions for further changes at ICSID to help ensure its continued success...|$|E
40|$|The study {{approaches}} in an unitary manner, the fundamental {{concepts of the}} theoretical and practical accomplishment of an European public administration: the European Administrative Space, the convergence and the administrative dynamics and the Europeanization. In {{the absence of a}} specific acquis communautaire, the European administration includes all the experiences and evolutions with relevant impact at national level, connected to the principles of a responsible and transparent administration, founded on the grounds of efficiency and efficacy. Particularly agreed upon within the <b>constituent</b> <b>treaties</b> of the European Union, these principles might form the general standards not only for the process of acceding to the European Union, but also for the convergence towards an European model of public administration. The efforts of analysts and specialists to describe the real evolution process of national administrations are with no doubt, extremely important, even though at some point, contradictory. The model of European administration makes use of the systemic analysis and offers the conceptual framework needed for covering the diverse problematic it encompasse...|$|R
40|$|Article J. 7 of the Amsterdam Treaty, which amends {{the treaty}} on European Union, {{establishes}} that the Western European Union shall provide the European Union {{with access to}} an operational capability for “humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks, and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacekeeping. ” Making reference to 1992 WEU Petersberg Declaration, these tasks {{are commonly known as}} Petersberg operations. This provision constitutes the integration of a part of the “WEU acquis” into the framework of the European Union, even though there is no institutional integration between the two organizations or legal interweave between their <b>constituents</b> <b>treaties.</b> The decision-making mechanism for Petersberg operations must be considered in relation to the new CFSP set of acts and it involves considerable interplay between the European Council, the Council and the WEU Council of Ministers. Several problems might arise from the different voting systems of these institutions and a specific question is posed by the more restricted composition of the WEU with respect to the EU, namely the five EU member States which are not fully-fledged WEU members. The development of an EU crisis management capability could have several positive consequences, both on an inter-European level and externally...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to provide an {{overview}} of the progressive augmentation of the supranational character of the governmental structure of the initial EEC, gradually evolving into the present European Union, particularly as a consequence of revisions to the <b>constituent</b> <b>Treaties.</b> Part I of this article presents the European Commission, the initial institution whose structure and operations have always been markedly supranational in character and which has always been dedicated to the promotion of supranational goals. Part II examines the Council of Ministers, the political institution that is intrinsically intergovernmental in character, but whose operational role in the adoption of legislation and policies took on significant supranational features in the late 1980 s. Part Ill then describes the European Parliament, which can be properly characterized as a supranational, or indeed federal, institution after it began to be directly elected in 1979, and which strongly promotes a supranational agenda. Part IV presents the intrinsically intergovernmental nature of the European Council, and then examines the impact of the Lisbon Treaty, which marks the start of a shift to a partially supranational operational role for that highest political body...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} treaty interpretation in {{the context}} of international organizations, with particular attention to interpreting the founding or constitutive treaties of organizations. That not all interpretive rules are the same for all treaties is a well-tried proposition (see e. g. Arnold McNair in BYIL 1930 and Joseph Weiler in EJIL 2010). The interest in different canons of treaty interpretation generally hinges on the distinction of interpretative practices for different areas of substantive law, such as investment treaties, or human rights treaties. What has been arguably under theorized is that interpretation of the rules of organizations begs an additional question which does not arise with other treaties, that is: whether interpretation of a treaty is even at issue. In other words, are UN Security Council resolutions a form of treaty law or do they amount to ‘international legislation’? Was the 1999 new ‘strategic concept’ of NATO a (highly ‘evolutive’) interpretation of the 1949 North Atlantic Treaty or a redefinition of powers and competences by an Organization making use of its compétence de la compétence? In practice it seems these questions are mostly answered by upholding both the treaty character and the institutional law character of such rules. If and when the law of treaties is applied, interpretive practice vis-à-vis constitutive treaties differs notably from general treaty interpretation on two counts. First, special weight is given to the ‘object and purpose’ of the treaty by way of a general teleological approach to interpretation, rather than as a means to establish the text’s ‘ordinary meaning’ per VCLT Article 31. Secondly, special weight is also given to the subsequent practice of the organization. In contrast, classic interpretive methods that safeguard the State party’s ‘sovereign will’ - such as recourse to the travaux préparatoires, party intention, and the subsequent practice of treaty parties - seem to have faded into the background. I argue that these points of distinction are related to the extra layer of the organization’s legal order over the <b>constituent</b> <b>treaty.</b> Or, put in doctrinal terms: these distinctions reflect a shift from a contractual to an institutional perspective (or even ‘paradigm’) on constitutive treaties. As a result, it is the organization, not the States parties, that ends up taking on any interpretative questions, and application of the classic law of treaties is limited...|$|E
40|$|On 18 December 2014 the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) {{delivered}} Opinion 2 / 13 and {{stunned the}} legal world by {{declaring that the}} Draft Agreement on the Accession of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights (the Accession Agreement) was incompatible with the <b>constituent</b> <b>treaties</b> of the Union. Although some experts, admittedly, had been skeptical about certain aspects of Draft Accession Agreement, {{no one seems to}} have expected an opinion so critical and uncompromising. The opinion has consequently received widespread disapproval in the EU legal blogosphere. While there are many threads in Opinion 2 / 13 that deserve critical analysis, I will focus here only on one: The CJEU’s interpretation and application of Article 344 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) —one of the five separate grounds given for rejecting the Accession Agreement. Specifically, I will compare the approach taken in Opinion 2 / 13 with the approach of the CJEU in earlier case-law. I will argue that the reasoning and conclusion concerning TFEU Article 344 in Opinion 2 / 13 is clearly at odds with this earlier case law, notably the leading MOX Plant case. I will also demonstrate how the approach to the issue in Opinion 2 / 13 —if it indeed reflects lex lata—seriously affects numerous treaties that the Union has already concluded.

40|$|Conferral of Powers by States as a Basis of Obligation of International Organisations]The {{power of}} states to confer powers on {{international}} organisations {{is an essential}} attribution to state sovereignty, where the exact rights and obligations, but also responsibility of the delegator and of the delegee for wrongful acts later depend on the forms and methods used for delegation. The article first examines which powers and thereafter how states may confer them on international organisations. The article brings examples of legislative, executive or judicial, exclusive or shared, express or implied, revocable, semi-revocable or non-revocable, specific or general, mere functional, specified, immediate or contingent, prior or ex post facto, clear or vague, and subsidiary powers. How powers are conferred depends on both the internal, as well as international constitutional guarantees. The bases of international obligation lie in ius cogens, erga omnes obligations, general principles of law, and treaties, from which most frequently for conferral of powers are used the latter - divisible into "common" international <b>treaties,</b> and <b>constituent</b> international <b>treaties</b> that constitute a source of an independent category of international norms - legislation by international organisations. The main conclusion is that although the agreed norms may be construed in the application process, the formal determination of powers remains the formal basis of action...|$|R
