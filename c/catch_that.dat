5|$|After facing {{criticism}} {{for a lack}} of production in the first two weeks, Smith turned in a record-setting performance against the St. Louis Rams in Week 3. In the first quarter, he scored on each of his first three career receptions with 74-, 41-, and 18-yard touchdowns. The 74-yard score was the longest completion of quarterback Joe Flacco's career. He became the first NFL rookie, and only the twelfth player, to amass three touchdown receptions in a single quarter. Smith finished the game with five receptions for 152yards in the 37–7 victory. It remains a Ravens rookie record, as does Smith's 30.4 yards per <b>catch</b> <b>that</b> day.|$|E
25|$|Unusual {{dismissals}} {{were to be}} {{the theme}} of the day. Kevin Pietersen was given out to a <b>catch</b> <b>that</b> didn’t appear to have carried, and Alastair Cook fell victim to a questionable lbw decision. Ravi Bopara was clean bowled by Lasith Malinga next ball, and England closed the day on 258/5 – which was disappointing given the promising start.|$|E

Bird's performance equalled Younis Khan's record of four catches {{as a substitute}} fielder in a Test. As he was a substitute fielder, those catches do not count towards his personal record.|$|R

25|$|In the Australian second innings, with Australia eight wickets {{down and}} a lead of only 75, his ninth-wicket {{partnership}} of 83 with Bob Massie gave Australia enough leeway to achieve a narrow victory. Watkins made 36, having scored only 12 runs in his previous five first-class matches. He did not bowl in the second innings but took the <b>catch</b> <b>that</b> won Australia the match.|$|E
25|$|In {{population}} ecology and economics, the {{maximum sustainable yield}} or MSY is, theoretically, the largest <b>catch</b> <b>that</b> can be taken from a fishery stock over an indefinite period. Under the assumption of logistic growth, the MSY will be exactly at half the carrying capacity of a species, as this is the stage at when population growth is highest. The maximum sustainable yield is usually higher than the optimum sustainable yield.|$|E
25|$|Australia made steady inroads on day four, {{although}} at tea England had steadied somewhat at 4/142. However, Lyon dismissed Cook for 65 straight after the resumption, initiating another collapse, which saw the tourists bowled out for 179. A substitute fielder Chris Sabburg, {{who entered the}} field for a brief moment, took a widely reported <b>catch</b> <b>that</b> dismissed Kevin Pietersen for 26. Australia won by 381 runs and Mitchell Johnson was named man of the match, claiming 5/42 in the second innings and nine wickets for the match.|$|E

25|$|In 1991, {{acting on}} the {{recommendation}} of the Scientific Committee, the IWC adopted a computerized formula, the Revised Management Procedure (RMP), for determining allowable catches of some whale species. Despite the fact that the RMP indicated that {{it would be possible to}} authorize a <b>catch</b> <b>that</b> year, the moratorium was not lifted. The IWC noted the need to agree on minimum standards for data, to prepare guidelines on the conduct of population surveys, and to devise and approve a system of measures for monitoring and inspection.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan {{continued}} {{to build their}} first innings total in the morning. Yousuf reached 173 before being stumped off an Anil Kumble delivery. Younis increased his score to 199 before being runout. Shahid Afridi scored a quick century, plundering 27 off a Harbhajan Singh over in the process. This equalled the second highest score off a single over in Test matches. Harbhajan had some small measure of revenge however, taking the <b>catch</b> <b>that</b> dismissed Afridi for 103. Wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal also scored a century, the fastest ever by a wicketkeeper, and Pakistan declared immediately thereafter with a mammoth total of 679 for 7.|$|E
25|$|The WICB {{announced}} its central contracts in November 2009, and Sammy {{was included in}} the 33-man list. He was given a GradeB contract (the second-highest level) worth $80,000. His career-best Man of the Match figures of 4–26 in the third ODI in Saint Vincent & the Grenadines would have been more flattering still had captain Chris Gayle been able to hold on to a <b>catch</b> <b>that</b> would have given the tall Saint Lucian the distinction of becoming the first West Indian to take a five-fer in every form of the game; he had 5–26 off the same opponents in a Twenty20 International earlier in the series.

25|$|An {{important}} {{issue is the}} age of the Russian fishing fleet. About two-thirds of the fishing vessels do not conform to safety norms. Compared to 1990, by 2000 capital investment in the industry had decreased thirty percent and the number of specialists qualified in fishing, navigation and processing technologies had decreased 30 to 40 percent. The Barents Sea cod fishery {{is an example of the}} dominance of elderly and ineffective vessels. Between 2002 and 2005, forty percent of effort in the demersal fishery was by elderly freezing trawlers, which produced only twenty-five percent of the official <b>catch.</b> <b>That</b> is, they were 1.5 times less effective than the other vessels in the fleet. Equivalent modern trawlers are three to four times as effective. The low efficiencies of these elderly vessels also implicates them in involvements with IUU catch.|$|E

Although it was a box office flop, having only grossed $10 million, it served as an important step for Bleu, who was still building his acting career at the time. During high school, he performed in such student productions as Footloose and Grease, winning the honor of Theatre Student of the Year.|$|E
25|$|Rowe {{was educated}} at Lancing College and at Uppingham School {{and then at}} Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, his batting and bowling styles are not known, but from his record in Cambridge University Cricket Club trial matches in 1858 and 1859, the {{university}} side appears to have regarded him primarily as a bowler. Nevertheless, it was a batsman, playing for the Cambridge Town Club against the university that he made impact in his first first-class game, scoring 45, the highest score of a rain-affected game: he also took wickets and made a <b>catch.</b> <b>That</b> led to his selection for the university team in the next game, a match against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), in which he batted at No 8 and scored 1 and 16, taking a single wicket. Though there were other non-first-class matches {{over the next few}} weeks for Cambridge University, he did not play first-class cricket again.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to their}} {{deferral}} {{of the opening}} kickoff, the Dolphins elected to receive the opening kickoff of the second half. A 46-yard Pennington pass to Ginn on the first play moved the Dolphins to the Patriots' 36-yard line; six plays later, Pennington hit fullback Casey Cramer on a 2-yard touchdown <b>catch</b> <b>that</b> gave the Dolphins the lead again at 21–17. The Patriots responded by going 78 yards on 11 plays, re-taking the lead yet again on the second Moss touchdown catch of the day; the 8-yard grab put the Patriots ahead 24–21. The Dolphins' next drive {{got as far as}} the Patriots' 27-yard line, but an offensive holding penalty, incomplete pass, and sack forced the Dolphins to punt from the Patriots' 42-yard line. Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play. After an incomplete pass to Moss, a 21-yard Faulk touchdown run extended the Patriots' lead to 31–21 on the final play of the third quarter.|$|E
25|$|The waters {{surrounding}} Scotland {{are some}} of the richest in Europe. Fishing is an economic mainstay in parts of the North East of Scotland and along the west coast, with important fish markets in places such as Aberdeen and Mallaig. Fish and shellfish such as herring, crab, lobster, haddock and cod are landed at ports such as Peterhead, the biggest white fish port in Europe, Fraserburgh, the biggest shellfish port in Europe, Stornoway, Lerwick and Oban. There has been a large scale decrease in employment in the fishing industry within Scotland, due initially to the sacrifice of national fishing rights to the EEC on the UK's accession to the Common Market in the 1970s, and latterly to the historically low abundances of commercially valuable fish in the North Sea and parts of the North Atlantic. To rebuild stocks the EU's Common Fisheries Policy places restrictions on the total tonnage of <b>catch</b> <b>that</b> can be landed, on the days at sea allowed and on fishing gear that can be deployed. These measures have so far been unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|Three plays later, the Cardinals punted to the Patriots, {{who began}} their next series from midfield. Two plays in, Cassel {{connected}} with Gaffney on a 37-yard completion, {{and then again}} to Faulk two plays later for a 15-yard touchdown reception, putting the Patriots ahead 21–0. Beginning from their own 19-yard line the Cardinals moved to the Patriots' 31-yard line on nine plays, but could not convert a 4th-and-1 pass on the tenth play, turning the ball over on downs. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 69-play drive culminating in an 11-yard Welker touchdown <b>catch</b> <b>that</b> gave the Patriots a 28–0 lead; Welker celebrated by making a snow angel in the end zone, costing the Patriots 15 yards on an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. As a result, the Cardinals began their next drive from their own 39-yard line, but punted again after three plays. With 1:24 remaining in the first half, the Patriots then moved from their own 29-yard line to the Cardinals' 20-yard line, but could get no further and on the final play of the half, Gostkowski kicked a 38-yard field goal to give the Patriots a 31–0 lead.|$|E
50|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 2010 season, the Broncos {{did start}} to mix Decker into the offense more, after fellow rookie Demaryius Thomas (a first round draft pick) went down with an injury.

Badgro had his big defensive moments as well. Playing against the Boston Redskins in 1935, Red blocked a punt and returned it for a go-ahead touchdown.|$|R
25|$|Facing {{their second}} West Coast game {{in as many}} weeks, the Patriots elected to {{practice}} at San José State University and to stay in Santa Clara, California in advance of flying to San Diego to face the Chargers in a Sunday night game at Qualcomm Stadium. On the first play of the game, Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers completed a 48-yard pass to wide receiver Vincent Jackson that brought the Chargers to the Patriots' 32-yard line. Three incomplete passes by Rivers from the Patriots' 7-yard line set up a 25-yard Nate Kaeding field goal that gave the Chargers a 3–0 lead. On their first possession, the Patriots reached the Chargers' 31-yard line, where Gostkowski missed a 48-yard field goal, his first such miss of the season. Four plays later, Rivers hit wide receiver Malcom Floyd on a 49-yard touchdown <b>catch</b> <b>that</b> extended the Chargers' lead to 10–0. The Patriots punted on their ensuing possession; the Chargers' Darren Sproles returned the punt 28 yards to start the Chargers' next drive from the Patriots' 45-yard line. A failed third-down conversion by the Chargers set up a missed 44-yard field goal attempt by Kaeding.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 1972 college {{football}} season, NCAA rules prohibited freshmen from participating on the varsity team, {{and as such}} many schools fielded freshmen teams. The Alabama freshmen squad was led by coach Clem Gryska for the 1967 season and finished {{with a record of}} three wins and one loss (3–1). The Baby Tide opened their season with a 34–14 victory over Mississippi State at Scott Field. On the first play of the game, Frank Mann threw a 63-yard touchdown pass to George Ranager for a 6–0 lead, and later in the first Roger Crowson scored on a 23-yard run that extended the Baby Tide lead to 13–0. State then scored their first touchdown in the final 0:30 of the quarter on a nine-yard Joe Joy touchdown <b>catch</b> <b>that</b> made the score 13–6. After a scoreless second, in the third Bill Ragle scored for Alabama on a 15-yard run followed by Cam Walker on a two-yard run that extended their lead to 27–6. The game came to a close with a pair of fourth-quarter touchdowns. First Tommy Weigand scored on a six-yard run for Alabama and this was followed with a 53-yard David Smith touchdown pass for State that made the final score 34–14.|$|E
25|$|Cincinnati {{received}} the opening kickoff {{of the second}} half, and exclusively ran {{the ball on the}} first several plays of the drive, even to the extent that Shaq Washington replaced Kay at quarterback, the latter of whom lined up at wide receiver; on third down and nine, however, Kay returned to quarterback on a passing play, but was sacked for the fifth time of the game, and the Bearcats were forced to punt, and Switzer tied the NCAA-record with his fifth punt return touchdown of the season, recording an 86-yard touchdown; the extra point was no good. CINCY finally scored a touchdown on their subsequent drive, via a 15-yard rush by Ralph Abernathy, making the score 29–10. On the ensuing kickoff, CINCY kicked the ball out of bounds, setting up UNC with solid field position at their own 35-yard line. Early in the drive Eric Ebron, hurdled a defender and hit the ground hard, but quickly re-entered the game, and caught another pass just a few plays later. Later in the drive, Switzer made a <b>catch</b> <b>that</b> converted a fourth down in the red zone; moments later, Morris rushed for a 1-yard touchdown. This time, the extra point was good to culminate a 13-play, 65-yard drive that encapsulated 4:36. CINCY's ensuing drive stalled, and they punted; Switzer made a fair catch. In the waning seconds of the quarter, CINCY entered the red zone.|$|E
