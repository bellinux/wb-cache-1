40|$|The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill {{currently}} before parliament is intended, in part, {{to reduce}} demand for ‘costly litigation’ in key areas of civil law.

Laura Bradley warns the Ministry of Justice to seriously consider the risk {{that some of the}} most controversial reforms may in fact increase demand for court and tribunal hearings, and reduce the chance that people’s everyday <b>civil</b> <b>legal</b> <b>disputes</b> end with agreement being reached...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} how some self-advocates handle their own <b>civil</b> <b>legal</b> <b>disputes</b> in circumstances where legal representation is not available. A combination of influences {{helps explain why}} some users of a specialised dispute resolution process {{were more likely to}} be effective and successful in their self-advocacy endeavours. Most importantly, the more effective users displayed positive attitudes, motivation and self-belief. They also demonstrated abilities in organisation, research and preparation. These attributes appeared to position them strongly to engage with and effectively manage the legal matters at hand. By contrast, other users in the same study were negatively disposed towards the challenges they faced. They lacked confidence and avoided seeking advice, conducting research, or preparing for their hearing. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{proposes a}} new form of dispute resolution, Expected Value Arbitration or “EVA. ” It would award a {{plaintiff}} the expected value of the outcome at trial or, in other words, the plaintiff would receive the amount she would recover on average if numerous courts were to decide her claim. EVA’s novel use of expected value gives it several virtues that distinguish it from trial, traditional binding arbitration, and other academic proposals for imposed compromise: first, EVA allows parties to insist on their legal rights without braving the risks of winner-take-all adjudication; second, it minimizes errors in adjudication; and, third, it encourages desirable expenditures in litigation. Moreover, unlike past proposals for imposed compromise, EVA involves arbitration, not trial. This makes EVA a practical idea. It also means that the right of the individual to resolve her <b>civil</b> <b>legal</b> <b>disputes</b> as she chooses supports making EVA available to litigants, whether one assesses EVA from an economic, rights-based, or public-life conception of adjudication...|$|R

50|$|Horse theft {{is still}} {{relatively}} common, {{with an estimated}} 40,000 horses a year being taken from their lawful owners by strangers or opponents in <b>civil</b> or <b>legal</b> <b>disputes.</b> Stolen Horse International is one modern-day organization in the US that works to reconnect stolen horses with their owners. Horses are sometimes stolen for their meat, or sometimes for ransom. Punishment for horse theft can still be severe, as one woman in Arkansas was sentenced to 60 {{years in prison for}} the 2011 theft of five horses and equestrian equipment; one of the horses was later found dead, while the others were recovered. Horse thefts today can in some cases be solved through the use of microchips, which is required in the European Union on horses born after 2009 and also often seen in other countries.|$|R

50|$|A {{court is}} a tribunal, {{often as a}} {{government}} institution, with the authority to adjudicate <b>legal</b> <b>disputes</b> between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters {{in accordance with the}} rule of law. In both common law and <b>civil</b> law <b>legal</b> systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all persons have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court.|$|R

The availability of direct application is qualified by the principle that the Bill of Rights should not be applied directly in a <b>legal</b> <b>dispute</b> unless it is necessary to do so.

40|$|Access {{to civil}} justice is a {{conceptual}} framework that, at its most basic, claims all people are entitled to have their <b>legal</b> <b>disputes</b> resolved fairly. However, it is currently understood that these ideals are not reflected in the day-to-day realities of ordinary people. Though scholarship has examined ways in which to better allow for meaningful access to civil justice, {{there is still a}} need for further quantitative research especially from the Canadian perspective. This paper provides an empirical foundation to this discussion by examining the 2014 Cost of Justice project survey. Specifically, it examines the incidence rate of <b>civil</b> <b>legal</b> problems, responses to legal problems, and costs of legal problems among Ontarians. The paper concludes by situating these findings into the legal consciousness framework so as to understand how Ontarians experience the law and how that may assist in providing meaningful access to justice reforms...|$|R
