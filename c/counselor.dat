40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 32) This study {{compares the}} opinions and attitudes {{related to the}} deaf population between deaf <b>counselors</b> and hearing <b>counselors.</b> The data was gathered from 35 subjects. Fifteen of the subjects were deaf <b>counselors</b> and 15 were hearing <b>counselors</b> from various sections of the country. Five subjects identified themselves as hard-of-hearing and, therefore, were omitted from this study. Very little empirical {{research has been done}} on the subject of counseling with deaf persons. One research study shows that there is no difference in attitudes towards the deaf person between hearing-impaired and hearing <b>counselors.</b> Another study, of Gallaudet College students, shows that the students with the greatest hearing loss and those who relied mostly on sign language preferred deaf <b>counselors.</b> This study finds that deaf <b>counselors</b> have more positive opinions about the deaf person than hearing <b>counselors.</b> The deaf <b>counselors</b> have a greater understanding and higher expectations of the deaf.
