25|$|Psychoanalysis {{comprises}} {{a method}} of investigating the mind and interpreting experience; a systematized set of theories about human behavior; and a form of psychotherapy to treat psychological or emotional distress, especially conflict originating in the unconscious mind. This school of thought originated in the 1890s with Austrian medical doctors including Josef Breuer (physician), Alfred Adler (physician), Otto Rank (psychoanalyst), and most prominently Sigmund Freud (neurologist). Freud's psychoanalytic theory was largely based on interpretive methods, introspection and <b>clinical</b> <b>observations.</b> It became very well known, largely because it tackled subjects such as sexuality, repression, and the unconscious. These subjects were largely taboo at the time, and Freud provided a catalyst for their open discussion in polite society. Clinically, Freud helped to pioneer the method of free association and a therapeutic interest in dream interpretation.|$|E

These doctrines dictate that physicians record their findings and their medicinal methods in a very clear and objective manner, so that these records may be passed down and employed by other physicians.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the value of}} serum C reactive protein (CRP) as a marker of erosive osteoarthritis (EOA) of the hand. Methods: Ninety eight patients, 67 with EOA and 31 with non-EOA of the hand, {{were included in the}} study and analysed for radiographic score (RS), number of erosions, and joint count (JC) at <b>clinical</b> <b>observation</b> and at bone scintigraphy. CRP was assayed in a serum sample by a highly sensitive immunonephelometric method. Results: The median (interquartile range) CRP level was 4. 7 (2. 4 - 6. 9) mg/l in the EOA and 2. 1 (0. 5 - 4. 9) mg/l in the non-EOA group (p = 0. 001). In all patients, CRP correlated with RS (r(s) = 0. 43, p< 0. 001), and mainly with JC at <b>clinical</b> <b>observation</b> (r(s) = 0. 72, p< 0. 001) and at bone scintigraphy (r(s) = 0. 47, p< 0. 001). The correlation of CRP with RS and JC was confirmed at <b>clinical</b> <b>observation</b> and at bone scintigraphy in the EOA subgroup, but only with JC at <b>clinical</b> <b>observation</b> in the non-EOA subgroup. Conclusions: CRP levels are higher in EOA than in non-EOA patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the feasibility and desirability of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) in day-care versus LC with <b>clinical</b> <b>observation.</b> SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been performed regularly as outpatient surgery {{in patients with}} uncomplicated gallstone disease in the United States, but {{this has not been}} generally accepted in Europe. The main objections are the risk of early severe complications (bleeding) or other reasons for readmission, and the argument that patients might feel safer when observed for one night. Quality-of-life differences hitherto have not been investigated. METHODS: Eighty patients (American Society of Anesthesiology [ASA] I/II) with symptomatic gallstones were randomized to receive LC either in day-care or with <b>clinical</b> <b>observation.</b> Complications, (re) admissions, consultations of general practitioners or the day-care center within 4 days after surgery, use of pain medication, quality of life, convalescence period, time off from professional activities, and treatment preference were assessed. The respective costs of day-care and <b>clinical</b> <b>observation</b> were determined. RESULTS: Of the 37 patients assigned to the day-care group who underwent elective surgery, 92 % were discharged successfully after an observation period of 5. 7 +/- 0. 2 hours. The remainder of the patients in this group were admitted to the hospital and clinically observed for 24 hours. For the 37 patients in the <b>clinical</b> <b>observation</b> group who underwent elective surgery, the observation time after surgery was 31 +/- 3 hours. Three patients in the day-care group and one patient in the <b>clinical</b> <b>observation</b> group had complications after surgery. None of the patients in either group consulted a general practitioner or the hospital during the first week after surgery. Use of pain medication was comparable in both groups over the first 48 hours after surgery. There were no differences in pain and other quality-of-life indicators between the groups during the 6 weeks of follow-up. Of the patients in the day-care group, 92 % preferred day-care to <b>clinical</b> <b>observation.</b> The same percentage of patients in the <b>clinical</b> <b>observation</b> group preferred at least 24 hours of observation to day-care. Costs for the day-care patients were substantially lower (approximately $ 750 /patient) than for the <b>clinical</b> <b>observation</b> patients. CONCLUSION: Effectiveness was equal in both patient groups, and both groups appeared to be satisfied with their treatment. Because no differences were found with respect to the other outcomes, day-care is the preferred treatment in most ASA I and II patients because it is less expensiv...|$|R

2500|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{theophylline}} may reverse the <b>clinical</b> <b>observations</b> of steroid insensitivity in patients with COPD and asthmatics who are active smokers (a condition resulting in oxidative stress) via a distinctly separate mechanism.

Furthermore, theophylline {{has been shown}} to directly activate HDAC2. [...] (Corticosteroids switch off the inflammatory response by blocking the expression of inflammatory mediators through deacetylation of histones, an effect mediated via histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2).

40|$|Background: Altered {{scapular}} {{rotation and}} position {{have been named}} scapular dyskinesis. Visual dynamic assessment {{could be applied to}} classify this alteration based on the <b>clinical</b> <b>observation</b> of the winging of the inferior medial scapular border (Type I) or of the prominence of the entire medial border (Type II), or by the excessive superior translation of the scapula (Type III). Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if there were differences in scapular rotations (Type I and II) and position (Type III) between a group of subjects with scapular dyskinesis, diagnosed by the <b>clinical</b> <b>observation</b> of an expert physical therapist, using a group of healthy individuals (Type IV). Method: Twenty-six asymptomatic subjects volunteered for this study. After a fatigue protocol for the periscapular muscles, the dynamic scapular dyskinesis tests were conducted to visually classify each scapula into one of the four categories (Type IV dyskinesis-free). The kinematic variables studied were the differences between the maximum rotational dysfunctions and the minimum value that represented both normal function and a small dysfunctional movement. Results: Only scapular anterior tilt was significantly greater in the type I dyskinesis group (<b>clinical</b> <b>observation</b> of the posterior projection of the inferior angle of the scapula) when compared to the scapular dyskinesis-free group (p= 0. 037 scapular and p= 0. 001 sagittal plane). Conclusions: <b>Clinical</b> <b>observation</b> was considered appropriate only in the diagnoses of dyskinesis type I. Considering the lower prevalence and sample sizes for types II and III, further studies are necessary to validate the <b>clinical</b> <b>observation</b> as a tool to diagnose scapular dyskinesis...|$|R

Even in the absence of traditional [...] "cerebellar signs" [...] in most dystonia patients, there are more subtle indications of cerebellar dysfunction.

Sobral Cid, who had supplied Moniz with the first set of patients for leucotomy from his own hospital in Lisbon, attended the meeting where he denounced frontal lobe surgery, declaring that the patients who had been returned to his care post-operatively were [...] "diminished" [...] and had suffered a [...] "degradation of personality". He also claimed that the changes Moniz observed in patients were more properly attributed to shock and brain trauma, and he derided the theoretical architecture that Moniz had constructed to support the new procedure as [...] "cerebral mythology." [...] At the same meeting the Parisian psychiatrist, Paul Courbon, stated he could not endorse a surgical technique that was solely supported by theoretical considerations rather than <b>clinical</b> <b>observations.</b> He also opined that the mutilation of an organ could not improve its function and that such cerebral wounds as were occasioned by leucotomy risked the later development of meningitis, epilepsy and brain abscesses.
