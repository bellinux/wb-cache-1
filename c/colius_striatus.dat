40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that fruit features such as nutrient content, size and colour have co-evolved with dispersal agent behaviour, physiology and morphology. Avian nectarivore feeding ecology is relatively well studied; however, less is known about fruit selection in avian frugivores. Previous work highlights the importance of individual factors that contribute towards fruit preferences, but few studies bring these factors together. Consequently the aim of this dissertation was to attempt this in terms of frugivory by investigating behavioural, physiological and morphological aspects of fruit selection in generalist avian dispersers. This was achieved by manipulating the nutritional content, size and colour of fruits (artificial fruits) under controlled conditions. The first part of the dissertation addresses physiological aspects of fruit selection in Red-winged Starling Onychognathus morio, Speckled Mousebird <b>Colius</b> <b>striatus</b> and Dark-Capped Bulbul Pycnonotus tricolor. Assimilation efficiency of birds fed glucose and sucrose diet treatments of varying concentration was observed...|$|E

40|$|Mousebirds (Coliiformes) exhibit {{well-developed}} communal roosting {{behaviour as well}} as {{a pronounced}} capacity for facultative hypothermic responses. We recorded body temperature (T b) in speckled mousebirds (<b>Colius</b> <b>striatus)</b> under semi-natural conditions in outdoor aviaries, and examined interactions between behavioural and metabolic thermoregulation by experimentally manipulating food availability and communal roosting behaviour. When food was available ad libitum, mousebirds roosting in a cluster maintained approximately constant rest-phase T b, with 32 °C b b in single mousebirds decreased at 0. 5 °C/hr and minimum rest-phase T b was significantly lower than when clustering. When food availability was restricted, the mousebirds exhibited facultative hypothermic responses that were less pronounced in clustering groups (minimum rest-phase T b = 33. 3 °C, circadian amplitude of T b = 9. 5 °C) compared to single birds (minimum rest-phase T b = 30. 7 °C, circadian amplitude of T b = 11. 8 °C). When clustering, rest-phase T b was highly synchronized among individuals. Our data reveal that communal roosting has profound consequences for restphase thermoregulation in C. striatus, and provide further insights into the potential role of physiological constraints in the evolution of avian sociality.     </strong...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThere is {{a global}} threat of {{invasive}} alien plants to biodiversity and ecosystem services. Of these, fleshy-fruited species are credited {{as some of the}} worst invaders and this is largely due to their mutualisms with local dispersers. Comparative studies between invasive and indigenous species can shed new insights into the traits which promote invasive plants success over their indigenous counterparts. This study compared the germination success of indigenous Solanum giganteum and invasive Solanum mauritianum, following ingestion by Red-winged Starlings (Onychognathus morio, Sturnidae) and Speckled Mousebirds (<b>Colius</b> <b>striatus,</b> Coliidae) and compared these with de-pulped seed and whole fruit controls. Nutritive and morphological fruit traits were also considered. Seed retention times were only obtained for Red-winged Starlings on both diets, and these did not differ. For both plant species, ingested and de-pulped seeds had similar germination success and mean daily germination, irrespective of frugivore type. However, pulp removal was important for S. giganteum. The type of avian frugivore affected the onset of germination, with the comparatively larger Red-winged Starlings promoting earlier germination of both S. mauritianum and S. giganteum seeds when compared to their controls, except for de-pulped S. mauritianum. These germinated {{at the same time as}} ingested S. mauritianum, but significantly earlier than de-pulped S. giganteum. Speckled Mousebirds consumed more S. mauritianum than S. giganteum, while Red-winged Starlings showed the opposite. While S. mauritianum had larger yellow fruits, their seeds were smaller, lighter and more numerous than those in the red fruits of S. giganteum. Furthermore, S. mauritianum fruits contained considerably more sugar content than S. giganteum fruits. In summary, offering greater nutritional rewards and generating greater reproductive outputs than indigenous species, can explain why fleshy-fruited exotics become highly invasive...|$|E
40|$|The Indian House Crow (Corvus splendens) is an Asiatic bird species, {{that was}} {{introduced}} to the coast of East Africa in the 1890 s (Lewis & Pomeroy, 1989). From Zanzibar, where colonial authorities introduced the species to act as an urban scavenger, the species has spread into coastal areas of Tanzania, Mozambique, South Africa, Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia. After being recorded {{for the first time in}} Kenya in 1947 in Mombasa, this omnivorous scavenger is now very common in and around Mombasa city and island, and has spread along the north and south coast, and also expanded its distribution inland, largely following the main Mombasa-Nairobi road and rail links (Lewis & Pomeroy, 1989). Perhaps the best example that demonstrates the remarkable adaptive behaviour of this bird species to human environments, is that of the preferred use by the crows of metallic wire for nest building, instead of plant twigs and branches, as reported from large cities in India (Altevogt & Davis, 1979). In and around Mombasa, the breeding season is well defined, from September to January, with a marked peak in October (Brown & Britton, 1980). The success of the Indian House Crow is considered to be the cause of the decline of some other bird species in the coastal area around Mombasa, such as Pied Crow (Corvus albus), Speckled Mousebird (<b>Colius</b> <b>striatus),</b> Mornincr Thrush (Cichladusa arauata) and Golden PalmWeaver (Ploceus bojeri) (Lewis and Pomeroy, 1993). The species is also causing harassment to people at some of the hotels along the Kenyan coast, and reportedly may cause economy losses by inflicting damage to crops and poultry (Yousuf, 1982; Dhindsa et al., 1991). In addition, the species has been reported to be a possible carrier and transmitter of diseases such as cholera and dysenteria (Munguti, 1984; » Anonymous, 1995). In and around Mombasa, this crow has become a pest species, and attempts for its eradication and/or control l have been on-going since 1984. Control efforts have focused on the use of traps, poisoned bait, shooting of adult birds and destroying of nests, eggs and chicks. The problems caused by the crows at the coast have even lead to the formation of a House Crow Control Committee to coordinate the control and eradication programme. It is virtually impossible to monitor the success of control or eradication programmes without any basic data on the distribution and numbers of the crows. At present, no reliable data are available on the number of crows around Mombasa. As recommended in the minutes of the last House Crow Control Committee meeting, there is need for more research into the Indian House Crow. The aims of the present study were: (1) to count the total number of crows that roost on Mombasa island; (3) to assess which areas these crows mainly come from; (3) to study the group size and behavior at their arrival...|$|E
40|$|A {{population}} of speckled mousebirds <b>Colius</b> <b>striatus</b> was colour-marked in Makokou, North-East Gabon, and studied from 1973 to 1977. Two {{different types of}} social groupings were found : (1) sedentary family groups, generally consisting of 1 to 3 adult males, 1 to 3 adult females, 1 or 2 young bachelor males, and sometimes one "satellite" adult female, and (2) nomadic group of 2 to 7 birds composed either of adult (mostly male) birds, or of young of the year (again mostly male). Such nomadic groups are most frequently seen in between the two annual bree ding seasons. The annual home range of a sedentary group varies from 10 to 15 ha. It contains a core area of about one hectare where the group roosts, breeds and takes its "dust baths", and which is defended against conspecific intruders. During the most favorable environmental conditions of the rainy season, sedentary mousebirds reach an average breeding density of 1. 3 bird/ha, subsequently increasing their numbers to 3 birds/ha later during the dry season. During the dry "lean period" 55 to 62 % of the birds wander through the whole area and/or move away to colonize marginal habitats or patches of second ary growth scattered in the surrounding rain-forest area. Males predominate among young and subadult speckled mousebirds; up to 75 % males being found among subadults. However, the sex-ratio is more balanced among adults (57. 5 % males), and is quite evenly divided among breeding individuals. The modal clutch-size is 2 eggs, but a female may lay clutches 4 to 8 times successively during a single year. The mortality rate during incubation and nestling stages is high (76. 5 %), but rnuch lower among sedentary adults which live more than 5 years in the study area. Whereas all y ung females of the year leave their nesting grounds and scatter beyond the study area, {{one of the young}} males will often stay within the parental family group for a further 1 to 3 years. A reverse situation is found among adults, those moving away being more frequently males. Adult females are less nomadic; they often settle temporarily in an area rich in fruit, before becoming "satellites" to an already established family group, or mating (as beta-females) with a sedentary male. The rate of population turnover is high amongst adult speckled mousebirds; 38 % of the sedentary adults moved out from the study area between July 1976 and July 1977. Both the young bachelor males staying with their parents (thereby delaying their sexual maturity for 6 to 14 months), and the "satellite" adult females, can be considered as a "potential breeder reserve" for the local mousebird population. The area surrounding the nest(s) and roost(s) of a sedentary group is defended by all group members against conspecific intruders. Food sources on the group's home range are also defended, at least to a certain extent. A dominant-subordinate hierarchy can be established between females of a given family group, and between adjacent sedentary groups with partially overlapping home-ranges. Two females belonging to a same family group may occasionally lay their eggs in the same, well protected, nest. "Helpers at the nest" are of common occurence among speckled mousebirds. ln most cases they are subadult males from the preceding generation helping their own parents. However, helpers can also be unrelated adults of both sexes. « Bachelor » male offspring can provide as much food to their sibling nestlings as their parents do. Pair bonds among sedentary breeders may be long-lasting. Out of 12 colour-marked pairs, 7 bred again the next year, 5 two years later and one three years later. One case of polyandry is reported. The size of the foraging flocks increases when food resources become scarce. When threatened by a predator, flocks split up in smaller groups using a different foraging technique. During the dry season, which is also the coldest in the Makokou area, mousebirds « huddle » in tight clusters at night, but separate during the da...|$|E
