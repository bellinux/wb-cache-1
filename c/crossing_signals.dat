25|$|The {{focus on}} rail safety by Metra comes from many fronts beyond {{operations}} including emergency preparedness and public awareness. The setup of railway platforms, use of grade <b>crossing</b> <b>signals</b> and horn blasts {{make up a}} critical system used to communicate movements of commuter trains to pedestrians and vehicles. Outside of these operational components, Metra aggressively pursues safety through public awareness. Metra utilizes its own Operation Lifesaver program and uses it to help spread safety messages. Metra also holds events promoting rail safety at schools and organizes a safety poster contest awarding winners with prizes and features their poster on monthly passes and at stations.|$|E
25|$|About 30 {{seconds before}} {{arriving}} at the crossing, the train trips a track circuit near the crossing, triggering the <b>crossing</b> <b>signals.</b> The lights begin to flash alternately, and a bell (or bells) mounted at the crossing begins ringing. After several seconds of flashing lights and ringing bells, the crossing gates (if equipped) begin to lower, which usually takes 5–10 seconds. Some AWDs silence the bell once the gates are fully lowered (typically seen on most Norfolk Southern and CSX crossings); most continue ringing the bells throughout (Union Pacific, BNSF Railway). Some crossings will not sound the bell at all after dark in the case that it is installed near a residential area. The lights continue to flash throughout regardless.|$|E
25|$|Some level {{crossings}} that are located close to intersections with traffic lights program the signals with a preemption sequence {{so when the}} approaching train trips the track circuit, it not only activates the <b>crossing</b> <b>signals,</b> but also changes the traffic lights facing the crossing to green, to clear any traffic that may be queued on the crossing. If the intersection's stop line is right before the tracks (typically sharing the crossing's stop line), the track circuits would change the traffic lights to red (often without a yellow phase). Some track circuits place the signals into flash mode the entire time the AWDs are active. In cases where railroads share {{the right of way}} with vehicular traffic, simple railroad preemption may cause an all-red flash in traffic lights.|$|E

25|$|Jungner {{had invented}} a nickel–iron battery {{the same year}} as his Ni-Cad battery, but found it to be {{inferior}} to its cadmium counterpart and, as a consequence, never bothered patenting it. It produced a lot more hydrogen gas when being charged, meaning it could not be sealed, and the charging process was less efficient (it was, however, cheaper). However, Thomas Edison picked up Jungner's nickel-iron battery design, patented it himself and sold it in 1903. Edison wanted to commercialise a more lightweight and durable substitute for the lead-acid battery that powered some early automobiles, and hoped that by doing so electric cars would become the standard, with his firm as its main battery vendor. However, customers found his first model to be prone to leakage and short battery life, and it did not outperform the lead-acid cell by much either. Although Edison was able to produce a more reliable and powerful model seven years later, by this time the inexpensive and reliable Model T Ford had made gasoline engine cars the standard. Nevertheless, Edison's battery achieved great success in other applications such as electric and diesel-electric rail vehicles, providing backup power for railroad <b>crossing</b> <b>signals,</b> or to provide power for the lamps used in mines.|$|E

2500|$|Mexico {{has also}} begun to install US-style <b>crossing</b> <b>signals</b> on some of its KCS de Mexico, Ferromex, & Ferrosur rail lines; however the {{majority}} of rail crossings in Mexico remain unsignalled, marked only with a crossbuck. The crossing devices {{are very similar to}} the US models, sporting larger lights. The crossbucks read [...] "Cruce de ferrocarril", [...] "Crucero ferrocarril", or [...] "Cuidado con el tren". The majority of crossings are solar operated, and the lights flash faster than the US signals. Unfortunately, these devices are easy targets for vandals as they steal their components such as gate motors and solar panels. In many cases the gates do not lower due to vandalism or lack of maintenance. In some cases {{due to the lack of}} maintenance, the lights do not turn on at all. The rail companies, which by law are required to maintain the <b>crossing</b> <b>signals,</b> take little to no action in maintaining these devices, and the majority remain unmaintained, posing a threat to drivers.|$|E
2500|$|This {{issue has}} led to a {{conflict}} in the United States between the vision-impaired and civil engineering communities. [...] One solution is to provide manually-operated pedestrian <b>crossing</b> <b>signals</b> at each entry. This increases construction and operation costs, and requires some way to disrupt traffic long enough for the pedestrian to cross (such as a HAWK beacon) that defeats the purpose of the roundabout. Signalisation also increases delays for most pedestrians during periods of light traffic, since pedestrians need to wait for a signal to change before (legally) crossing.|$|E

2500|$|The 1999 Bourbonnais, Illinois, train {{crash was}} a train-truck {{collision}} between Amtrak's southbound City of New Orleans passenger train and a semi {{truck in the}} village of Bourbonnais, Illinois, near the city of Kankakee.

[...] A National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation into the accident attributed the cause to the truck driver trying to beat the train across a grade crossing. [...] However, the Illinois State Police investigation found track circuit malfunction as the cause. [...] The NTSB's recommendations from the accident included increased enforcement of grade <b>crossing</b> <b>signals,</b> the installation of train event recorders at all new or improved grade crossings, and procedures to provide emergency responders with accurate lists of all crew members and passengers aboard trains.
