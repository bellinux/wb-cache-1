60|$|Perhaps already you {{may know}} SIR BLENNERHASSET PORTICO? A Captain in the Navy, he - A Baronet and K.C.B. You do? I thought so! It was that Captain's {{favourite}} whim (A notion not confined to him) That RODNEY was the greatest tar Who ever wielded <b>capstan-bar.</b> He had been taught so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I fixed {{upon the}} stock-broker a terrible glare and stepped toward him. 'Money miscreant!' I yelled, 'you it was who tried first to murder me, {{and then to}} turn the hearts of all these good men against me!' I raised my <b>capstan-bar</b> in the air. 'Aroint thee, fiend!' I yelled. 'Get thee below; and if anon I see thee I will break thy dastardly skull!' ...|$|E
60|$|They {{brought him}} white kid gloves, and pails, And candlesticks, and potted quails, And <b>capstan-bars,</b> and scales and weights, And {{ornaments}} for empty grates.|$|R
6000|$|The tide {{had ceased}} rising, it being that time known as [...] "slack water," [...] when the <b>capstan-bars</b> were brought into use, and {{every member of}} the party exerted all his {{strength}} in the effort.|$|R
60|$|The {{accommodations}} of our chapel {{were very}} poor. We {{had nothing to}} sit on but the great gun-rammers and <b>capstan-bars,</b> placed horizontally upon shot-boxes. These seats were exceedingly uncomfortable, wearing out our trowsers and our tempers, and, no doubt, impeded the con-version of many valuable souls.|$|R
6000|$|There {{was much}} chat in the smoking-cabin {{on the upper}} deck after luncheon to-day, mostly whaler yarns from those old sea-captains. Captain Tom Bowling was garrulous. He had that garrulous {{attention}} to minor detail which is born of secluded farm life or life at sea on long voyages, where {{there is little to}} do and time no object. He would sail along till he was right in the most exciting part of a yarn, and then say, [...] "Well, as I was saying, the rudder was fouled, ship driving before the gale, head-on, straight for the iceberg, all hands holding their breath, turned to stone, top-hamper giving 'way, sails blown to ribbons, first one stick going, then another, boom! smash! crash! duck your head and stand from under! when up comes Johnny Rogers, <b>capstan-bar</b> in hand, eyes a-blazing, hair a-flying... no, 'twa'n't Johnny Rogers... lemme see ... seems to me Johnny Rogers wa'n't along that voyage; he was along one voyage, I know that mighty well, but somehow {{it seems to me that}} he signed the articles for this voyage, but--but--whether he come along or not, or got left, or something happened--" ...|$|E
60|$|This {{time the}} females were not required, it {{being in the}} power of the gentlemen to heave the launch out to the side of the ship, Paul {{managing}} the different falls so adroitly, that the heavy boat was brought so near and yet so much above the rail, as to promise to clear it. John Effingham now stood at one of the stay-tackle falls, and Paul at the other, when the latter made a signal to ease away. The launch settled slowly towards the side of the vessel until it reached the rail, against which it lodged. Catching a turn with his fall, Mr. Blunt sprang forward, and bending beneath the boat, he saw that its keel had hit a belaying-pin. One blow from a <b>capstan-bar</b> cleared away this obstruction, and the boat swung off. The stay-tackle falls were let go entirely, and all on board saw, with an exultation that words can scarcely describe, the important craft suspended directly over the sea. No music ever sounded more sweetly to the listeners than the first plash of the massive boat as it fell heavily upon the surface of the water. Its size, its roof, and its great strength gave it an appearance of security, that for the moment deceived them all; for, in contemplating the advantage they had so unexpectedly gained, they forgot the many obstacles that existed to their availing themselves of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I {{stood and}} took some long, deep breaths; then, having made {{everything}} ready, I jerked {{myself out of}} that diving-suit in a very few seconds, and, standing free, I gave a great leap upward, and {{went straight to the}} surface. I am a good swimmer, and with a few strokes I caught the chains. Stealthily I clambered up, making not the least noise, and peeped over the rail. There was nobody forward. The whole ship's company seemed to be crowded aft, where there was a great stir and confusion. I slipped quietly over the rail and, without being seen by anybody, made my way into the forecastle. I hurried to my sea-chest. I took off my wet things and dressed myself in an almost new suit of shore clothes which I had never worn on the brig. I did not lose any more time than I could help, but I took unusual care in dressing myself. I put on a new pair of yellow shoes, and turned up the bottom of my trousers so as to show my red socks. I had a big felt hat which I had bought in Mexico, with a little feather in it; and this I put on, pulling it rakishly over on one side. I put around my neck a long blue silk cravat with white spots, which I tied in the biggest bow I could make. Then, feeling that I ought to have something in my hands, I picked up a <b>capstan-bar,</b> and laying it across my arm after the manner of a cutlass, I went boldly on deck.|$|E
6000|$|... "Be careful," [...] Joe whispered. [...] "Can't you {{see that}} they've got the <b>capstan-bars</b> ready for use? We should be knocked over like nine-pins before it would be {{possible}} to strike a blow. There may be some fire-arms aft, and if we get hold of them first all the advantage will be on our side." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{prognostic}} {{was true}} enough, for instead of gaping and stretching themselves about the deck, {{as had been}} the case with most of them a minute before, the men now commenced their duty in good earnest, calling to each other to come to the falls and the <b>capstan-bars,</b> and to stand by the heels of the sheers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{forgot to}} say, that the lads always took <b>capstan-bars,</b> or gunners' handspikes, or crows with them, to rap the beasts over the noses {{if they got}} to be troublesome. No, no, I have no liking for bears and wolves, though a whale, in my eye, {{is very much the}} same sort of fish as a red herring after it is dried and salted. Mabel and I had better stick to the canoe." ...|$|R
60|$|All was ready; boats hoisted in, stun' sail gear rove, {{messenger}} passed, <b>capstan-bars</b> {{in their}} places, accommodation-ladder below; and in glorious spirits, {{we sat down}} to dinner. In the ward-room, the lieutenants were passing round their oldest port, and pledging their friends; in the steerage, the middies were busy raising loans to liquidate the demands of their laundress, or else--in the navy phrase--preparing to pay their creditors with a flying fore-topsail. On the poop, the captain was looking to windward; and in his grand, inaccessible cabin, the high and mighty commodore sat silent and stately, as the statue of Jupiter in Dodona.|$|R
60|$|ALL {{that night}} {{we were in a}} great bustle getting things stowed in their place, and boatfuls of the squire's friends, Mr. Blandly and the like, coming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return. We never had a night at the Admiral Benbow when I had half the work; and I was dog-tired when, a little before dawn, the {{boatswain}} sounded his pipe and the crew began to man the <b>capstan-bars.</b> I might have been twice as weary, yet I would not have left the deck, all was so new and interesting to me--the brief commands, the shrill note of the whistle, the men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ship's lanterns.|$|R
6000|$|... "How am I to help it!" [...] {{asked the}} captain, {{a good deal}} to the point, though he {{overlooked}} the essential fact, that, by heaving-to, {{and waiting for the}} steamer's boat to board him, he might have prevented a second shot, as completely as if he had the ordering of the whole affair. No second shot was fired, however. As it afterward appeared, the screams of Mrs. Budd and Biddy were heard on board the steamer, the captain of which, naturally enough, supposing that the slaughter must be terrible where such cries had arisen, was satisfied with the mischief he had already done, and directed his people to secure their gun and go to the <b>capstan-bars,</b> in order to help lift the anchor. In a word, the revenue vessel was getting under way, man-of-war fashion, which means somewhat expeditiously.|$|R
6000|$|The {{process of}} making sail succeeded. There was no [...] "letting fall" [...] a fore-topsail here, as on board a merchant-man, but all the canvas dropped from the yards, into festoons, at the same instant. Then the three topsails were sheeted home and hoisted, all at once, and all in a single minute of time; the yards were counter-braced, and the <b>capstan-bars</b> were again manned. In two more minutes it was [...] "heave and she's up and down." [...] Then [...] "heave and in sight," [...] and [...] "heave and pull again." [...] The cat-fall was ready, and it was [...] "hook on," [...] when the fife seemed to turn its {{attention}} to another subject as the men catted the anchor. Literally, all this was done {{in less time than}} we have taken to write it down in, and in very little more time than the reader has wasted in perusing what we have here written.|$|R
60|$|With the Proserpine it was {{different}} Her <b>capstan-bars</b> flew round, and one anchor was actually catted by the time her captain appeared on deck. The other soon followed, the three topsails fell, were sheeted home and hoisted, and sail was set after sail, until the ship went steadily past the low promontory of Ana Capri a cloud of canvas. Her head was to the westward, inclining a little north; and had there been any one to the southward to watch her movements, as there was not, {{so far as the}} eye could see, it would have been supposed that she was standing over toward the coast of Sardinia, most probably with an intention of passing by the Straits of Bonifacio, between that island and Corsica. The wind being nearly east, and it blowing a good breeze, the progress of the ship was such as promised to fulfil all the expectations of her commander.|$|R
6000|$|Having {{accomplished}} this mission, Nelson received orders to join Commodore Linzee at Tunis. On the way, five sail {{of the enemy}} were discovered {{off the coast of}} Sardinia, and he chased them. They proved to be three forty-four gun frigates, with a corvette of twenty-four and a brig of twelve. The AGAMEMNON had only 345 men at quarters, having landed part of her crew at Toulon, and others being absent in prizes. He came near enough one of the frigates to engage her, but at great disadvantage, the Frenchman manoeuvring well and sailing greatly better. A running fight of three hours ensued, during which the other ships, which were at some distance, made all speed to come up. By this time the enemy was almost silenced, when a favourable change of wind enabled her to get out of reach of the AGAMEMNON's guns; and that ship had received so much damage in the rigging that she could not follow her. Nelson, conceiving that this was but the forerunner of a far more serious engagement, called his officers together, and asked them if the ship was fit to go into action against such a superior force without some small refit and refreshment for the men. Their answer was, that she certainly was not. He then gave these orders,--"Veer the ship, and lay her head to the westward: let some of the best men be employed in refitting the rigging, and the carpenter in getting crows and <b>capstan-bars</b> to prevent our wounded spars from coming down: and get the wine up for the people, with some bread, for it may be half an hour good before we are again in action." [...] But when the French came up, their comrade made signals of distress, and they all hoisted out their boats to go to her assistance, leaving the AGAMEMNON unmolested.|$|R
6000|$|... “The {{thought of}} what was coming gave us fresh strength. We went at them with a will, and drove them {{back a couple of}} yards. Then Pearson shouted ‘Run!’ and back we went aft as hard as we could tear, Pearson and I almost {{dragging}} Conklin with us. As we passed between the guns, with the Malays close at our heels, both men fired; the guns were crammed almost to the mouth with bullets, and the execution was awful. In a moment we dashed at them again, while the men forward, who had armed themselves with the <b>capstan-bars,</b> ran down the ladder and fell upon them. In another minute it was all over. The Malays who remained alive sprang over the bulwark, and we discharged the remaining five cannons into the canoes, smashing up numbers of them, and the rest paddled for the shore for their lives. We had time now to look around. It was an awful sight. Over fifty Malays lay dead, together with eleven of our men, besides the captain. If it had not been for Pearson not a soul would have lived to tell the tale. After it was over, we found that, as the crowds on deck had increased, most of our old hands, who were the men that had taken the pistols, had gradually gathered near the forecastle. Some of the others had joined them, and when the outbreak came, they had for a time been able to make a stout resistance, until one of their number, who was on the forecastle when the fight began, shouted to them that we were training the cannon forward, and they then made a rush up and joined him.|$|R
