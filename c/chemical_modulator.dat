All of them represent discrete domains, a contrast with the one where the GasNet was originally introduced, which had an essentially continuous nature. These scenarios are well-known benchmark problems from the literature and, since they exhibit varying degrees of complexity, they impose distinct performance demands on the GasNet. The experiments were primarily intended to better understand the model, by extending the original problem domain where GasNet was introduced. The results reported point at some difficulties with the current GasNet model...|$|E

The {{pharmacological}} {{inhibition of}} general transcriptional regulators {{has the potential}} to block growth through targeting multiple tumorigenic signaling pathways simultaneously. Here, using an innovative cell-based screen, we identify a structurally unique small molecule (named JIB- 04) which specifically inhibits the activity of the Jumonji family of histone demethylases in vitro, in cancer cells, and in tumors in vivo. Unlike known inhibitors, JIB- 04 is not a competitive inhibitor of α-ketoglutarate. In cancer but not in patient-matched normal cells, JIB- 04 alters a subset of transcriptional pathways and blocks viability. In mice, JIB- 04 reduces tumor burden and prolongs survival. Importantly, we find that patients with breast tumors that overexpress Jumonji demethylases have significantly lower survival. Thus JIB- 04, a novel inhibitor of Jumonji demethylases in vitro and in vivo, constitutes a unique potential therapeutic and research tool against cancer, and validates the use of unbiased cellular screens to discover <b>chemical</b> <b>modulator...</b>|$|E

Induction of cardiomyogenesis and enrichment of nodal-like CMs was described for mouse {{pluripotent stem cells}} (mPSCs) in response to 1 -ethyl- 2 -benzimidazolinone (EBIO), a <b>chemical</b> <b>modulator</b> of small-/intermediate-conductance Ca 2 +-activated potassium channels (SKs 1 – 4). Investigating EBIO in human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), we have applied three independent differentiation protocols of low to high cardiomyogenic efficiency.

However, our study revealed extensive EBIO-triggered cell loss favoring cardiac progenitor preservation and, subsequently, CMs with shortened action potentials. Proliferative cells were generally more sensitive to EBIO, presumably via an SK-independent mechanism.

We examined the effects of lipoic acid (LA) on inflammatory responses of BV- 2 microglial cells activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and explored the underlying mechanisms of action of LA. BV- 2 cells treated with LPS showed an up-regulation of mRNA of the pro-inflammatory molecules, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). LA suppressed the expression of iNOS and furthermore, LPS-induced production of nitrite. Moreover, LA suppressed the nuclear translocation of RelA, a component of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) that contains transcriptional activator domain for LPS. The mechanisms of LA-mediated anti-inflammatory effects on microglia remain unknown, and we suggested an involvement of Akt/glycogen synthase kinase- 3 β (GSK- 3 β) phosphorylation. The results showed that inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase prevented LA-mediated suppression of LPS induction of RelA and expression of iNOS. Furthermore, these inflammatory actions were prevented by GSK- 3 β inhibitors. These data demonstrate a role for LA as a <b>chemical</b> <b>modulator</b> of inflammatory responses by microglia, and thus may be a therapeutic strategy for treating neurodegenerative diseases with an inflammatory component. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society...|$|E

Currently, there is no commercially available TUBB 3 /&# 946;III-tubulin inhibitor. Regulation of &# 946;III-tubulin is poorly understood, making it difficult to target this protein. We sought to identify a <b>chemical</b> <b>modulator</b> of TUBB 3 /&# 946;III-tubulin expression, as it will be a valuable research tool to probe TUBB 3 /&# 946;III-tubulin regulation. A novel small molecule TUBB 3 /&# 946;III-tubulin enhancer, WECC 0017371, was identified in our high throughput screen, based on its ability to modulate TUBB 3 promoter activity. WECC 0017371 demonstrated the ability to significantly enhance TUBB 3 /&# 946;III-tubulin expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Additionally, WECC 0017371 did not alter microtubule morphology but enhanced &# 946;III-tubulin immunostaining in two independent NSCLC cell lines, H 460 and H 1299, compared to control. Importantly, WECC 0017371 enhanced &# 946;III-tubulin aberrant expression was functional and led to a significant decrease in in vitro sensitivity to DNA-damaging and tubulin-binding agents. Using chemical modifications, the efficacy, potency and selectivity of WECC 0017371 was further improved for the study of TUBB 3 /&# 946;III-tubulin regulation. The superior WECC 0017371 analogue, ENTD 014 was developed into an affinity chromatography probe for future studies to identify intracellular proteins that it binds to enhance TUBB 3 /&# 946;III-tubulin expression. Negative control probes were also developed to identify and eliminate proteins that bind non-specifically to the affinity probe. To understand how WECC 0017371 is exerting its effects on TUBB 3 expression, NSCLC cells were treated, mRNA isolated and a microarray and bioinformatics approach was used. Coordinated gene expression changes in multiple members of the mitotic and p 53 signalling pathways were detected in WECC 0017371 -treated cells. In conclusion, a novel chemical research tool has been developed in this thesis to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying TUBB 3 /&# 946;III-tubulin regulation in NSCLC and &# 946;III-tubulin-mediated pathobiology...|$|E

The peroxisome is an organelle housing many critical oxidative reactions. In oilseed plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, peroxisomes metabolize stored fatty acids to fuel germination and early development. Although a general {{framework for understanding}} peroxisome biogenesis is in place, detailed biogenesis mechanisms remain unclear and how peroxisomes respond to environmental challenges is not well understood. Proteins required for peroxisome biogenesis or protein import into the organelle are named peroxins or PEX proteins. PEX 5 is a shuttling peroxisomal matrix protein receptor, traveling between the peroxisome and the cytosol. Peroxisome-associated enzymes ubiquitinate PEX 5 to signal either return to the cytosol or degradation by the proteasome. I characterized mutants with defective peroxisome-associated ubiquitination machinery and found that mutations in the peroxisome-associated ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (PEX 4) and three RING ubiquitin-protein ligases (PEX 2, PEX 10, and PEX 12) conferred elevated PEX 5 levels. Disruption of any Arabidopsis RING peroxin decreased PEX 10 levels, indicating that each RING peroxin is required for RING complex stability, as in yeast and mammals. Moreover, reducing PEX 4 function in the pex 12 - 1 mutant restored PEX 10 levels and partially ameliorated molecular and physiological defects, leading to the hypothesis that PEX 4 -dependent ubiquitination on the pex 12 - 1 ectopic Lys residue destabilizes the RING peroxin complex in pex 12 - 1. Peroxisomes are dynamic; peroxisomal contents and abundance change to accommodate environmental stimuli, including salinity and high temperature. I found that although growth on high salt promotes peroxisome proliferation, levels of certain peroxisomal proteins were reduced, presumably due to β-oxidation-dependent oxidative stress promoted peroxisomal protein degradation and that catalase protected peroxisomal proteins from degradation. I also found that mildly elevated growth temperature increased proteasomal degradation of PEX 5 to reduce overall and detrimental membrane-associated PEX 5 levels and alleviated peroxisomal defects in the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme mutant pex 4 - 1. Overall, this work has increased understanding of individual peroxins and provided insights into peroxisome-environment interactions. I also developed chemical-genetic screens to identify effective <b>chemical</b> <b>modulators</b> of peroxisome functions. Because peroxisome functions and peroxins are highly conserved, these insights and <b>chemical</b> <b>modulators</b> might be useful in peroxisome studies in diverse organisms...|$|R

40|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>modulators</b> of {{autophagy}} {{provide useful}} pharmacological tools for examination of autophagic processes, and also {{may lead to}} new therapeutic agents for diseases in which control of cellular sequestration and degradation capacity are beneficial. We have identified that timosaponin A-III (TAIII), a medicinal saponin reported to exhibit anticancer properties and improve brain function, is a pronounced activator of autophagy. In this work, the salient features and functional role of TAIII-induced autophagy were investigated. In TAIII-treated cells, autophagic flux with increased formation of autophagosomes and conversion into autolysosomes is induced in association with inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin activity and elevation of cytosolic free calcium. The TAIII-induced autophagy is distinct from conventional induction by rapamycin, exhibiting large autophagic vacuoles that appear to contain significant contents of endosomal membranes and multivesicular bodies. Furthermore, TAIII stimulates biosynthesis of cholesterol, which is incorporated to the autophagic vacuole membranes. The TAIII-induced autophagic vacuoles capture ubiquitinated proteins, and in proteasome-inhibited cells TAIII promotes autophagy of aggregation-prone ubiquitinated proteins. Our studies demonstrate that TAIII induced a distinct form of autophagy, {{and one of its}} pharmacological actions is likely to enhance the cellular quality control capacity via autophagic clearance of otherwise accumulated ubiquitinated protein aggregates. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Determination of {{molecular}} species comprised of the biogenic {{elements in the}} atmospheres of planets and moons {{of the solar system}} is one the foremost requirements of the exobiologist studying chemical evolution and the origin of life. Multiplex chromatography is a technique where many samples are pseudo-randomly introduced to the chromatograph without regard to elution of preceding components. The resulting data are then reduced using mathematical techniques such as cross correlation or Fourier Transforms. To demonstrate the utility of this technique for future solar system exploration, <b>chemical</b> <b>modulators</b> were developed. Several advantages were realized from this technique in combination with these modulators: improvement in detection limits of several orders of magnitude, improvement in the analysis of complex mixtures by selectively modulating some of the components present in the sample, {{increase in the number of}} analyses that can be conducted in a given period of time, and reduction in the amount of expendables needed to run an analysis. In order to apply this technique in a real application, methane in ambient air was monitored continuously over a period of one week. By using ambient air as its own carrier all expendables beyond power were eliminated...|$|R
40|$|The {{transient}} receptor potential melastatin-subfamily member 7 (TRPM 7) is a ubiquitously expressed {{ion channel}} with intrinsic kinase activity. Molecular and electrophysiological {{analyses of the}} structure and activity of TRPM 7 have revealed functional coupling of its channel and kinase activity. Studies have indicated the important roles of TRPM 7 channel-kinase in fundamental cellular processes, physiological responses, and embryonic development. Accumulating evidence has shown that TRPM 7 is aberrantly expressed and/or activated in human diseases including cancer. TRPM 7 plays a variety of functional roles in cancer cells including survival, cell cycle progression, proliferation, growth, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Data from a study using mouse xenograft of human cancer show that TRPM 7 is required for tumor growth and metastasis. The aberrant expression of TRPM 7 and its genetic mutations/polymorphisms {{have been identified in}} various types of carcinoma. <b>Chemical</b> <b>modulators</b> of TRPM 7 channel produced inhibition of proliferation, growth, migration, invasion, invadosome formation, and markers of EMT in cancer cells. Taken together, these studies suggest the potential value of exploiting TRPM 7 channel-kinase as a molecular biomarker and therapeutic target in human malignancies...|$|R
40|$|The {{conversion}} of chemical energy into mechanical force by AAA+ (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) ATPases {{is integral to}} cellular processes, including DNA replication, protein unfolding, cargo transport, and membrane fusion 1. The AAA+ ATPase motor cytoplasmic dynein regulates ciliary trafficking 2, mitotic spindle formation 3, and organelle transport 4, and dissecting its precise functions has been challenging due to its rapid timescale of action {{and the lack of}} cell-permeable, <b>chemical</b> <b>modulators.</b> Here we describe the discovery of ciliobrevins, the first specific small-molecule antagonists of cytoplasmic dynein. Ciliobrevins perturb protein trafficking within the primary cilium, leading to their malformation and Hedgehog signaling blockade. Ciliobrevins also prevent spindle pole focusing, kinetochore-microtubule attachment, melanosome aggregation, and peroxisome motility in cultured cells. We further demonstrate the ability of ciliobrevins to block dynein-dependent microtubule gliding and ATPase activity in vitro. Ciliobrevins therefore will be useful reagents for studying cellular processes that require this microtubule motor and may guide the development of additional AAA+ ATPase superfamily inhibitors.

40|$|Neuropeptides {{represent}} a diverse class of signaling molecules originating from neural tissues. These <b>chemical</b> <b>modulators</b> orchestrate complex physiological events including {{those associated with}} growth and reproduction. De novo transcriptome sequencing of a cerebral ganglion library of the endangered giant triton snail (Charonia tritonis) was undertaken {{in an effort to}} identify key neuropeptides that control or influence its physiology. The giant triton snail is considered a primary predator of the corallivore Acanthaster planci (Crown-of-Thorns Starfish) that is responsible for a significant loss in coral cover on reefs in the Indo-Pacific. The transcriptome library was assembled into contigs, and then bioinformatic analysis was used to identify a repertoire of 38 giant triton snail neuropeptide precursor genes, and various isoforms, that encode conserved molluscan neuropeptides. C. tritonis neuropeptides show overall precursor organization consistent with those of other molluscs. These include those neuropeptides associated with mollusc reproduction such as the APGWamide, buccalin, conopressin, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), NKY and egg-laying hormone. These data provide a foundation for further studies targeted towards the functional characterisation of neuropeptides to further understand aspects of the biology of the giant triton snail, such as elucidating its reproductive neuroendocrine pathway to allow the development of knowledge based captive breeding programs...|$|R
