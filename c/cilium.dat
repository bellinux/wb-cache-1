5|$|A <b>cilium</b> (fine hair) which {{projects}} {{above the}} surface and acts as a trigger. Spirocysts do not have cilia.|$|E
5|$|Some {{eukaryotic}} cells, {{such as the}} protist Euglena, {{also have}} flagella, but eukaryotic flagella do not rotate at the base; rather, they bend {{in such a way}} that the tip of the flagellum whips in a circle. The eukaryotic flagellum, also called a <b>cilium</b> or undulipodium, is structurally and evolutionarily distinct from prokaryotic flagella.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen {{views the}} brachiopods and closely related phoronids as {{affiliated}} with the deuterostome pterobranchs because their lophophores are driven by one <b>cilium</b> per cell, while those of bryozoans, which he regards as protosomes, have multiple cilia per cell. However, pterobranchs are hemichordates and probably closely related to echinoderms, {{and there is no}} evidence that the latest common ancestor of pterobranchs and other hemichordates or the latest common ancestor of hemichordates and echinoderms was sessile and fed by means of tentacles.|$|E
5|$|The body wall {{consists}} of a cuticle, an epidermis and longitudinal and circular bands of muscle fibres. In some primitive species, each epidermal cell has a single <b>cilium,</b> a feature shared only by the gnathostomulans. The whole ventral surface of the animal may be ciliated or the cilia may be arranged in rows, patches or transverse bands. The cuticle is locally thickened in some gastrotrichs and forms scales, hooks and spines. There is no coelom (body cavity) and {{the interior of the}} animal is filled with poorly differentiated connective tissue. In the macrodasyidans, Y-shaped cells, each containing a vacuole, surround the gut and may function as a hydrostatic skeleton.|$|E
25|$|Cellular and {{systemic}} control of osmotic pressure (the difference in osmolarity between the cytosol and the extracellular medium) {{is critical for}} homeostasis. There are three ways in which cells can detect osmotic stimuli: as changes in macromolecular crowding, ionic strength, {{and changes in the}} properties of the plasma membrane or cytoskeleton (the latter being a form of mechanotransduction). These changes are detected by proteins known as osmosensors or osmoreceptors. In humans, the best characterised osmosensors are transient receptor potential channels present in the primary <b>cilium</b> of human cells. In yeast, the HOG pathway has been extensively characterised.|$|E
25|$|Despite their {{flattened}} shape, satellite glial cells contain all common organelles {{necessary to}} make cellular products and to maintain the homeostatic environment of the cell. The plasma membrane of SGCs is thin and not very dense, and it is associated with adhesion molecules, receptors for neurotransmitters and other molecules, and ion channels, specifically potassium ion channels. Within individual SGCs, there is both rough endoplasmic reticulum and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, but the latter is much less abundant. Most often the Golgi apparatus and the centrioles in an SGC are found in a region {{very close to the}} cellâ€™s nucleus. On the other hand, mitochondria are found throughout the cytoplasm along with the organelles involved in autophagy and other forms of catabolic degradation, such as lysosomes, lipofuscin granules, and peroxisomes. Both microtubules and intermediate filaments can be seen throughout the cytoplasm, and most often they lie parallel to the SGC sheath. These filaments are found in greater concentrations at the axon hillock and at the beginning portion of an axon in an SGC of the sympathetic ganglia. In some SGCs of the sensory ganglia researchers have seen a single <b>cilium</b> that extends outward from the cell surface near the nucleus and into the extracellular space of a deep indentation in the plasma membrane. The <b>cilium,</b> however, only has the nine pairs of peripheral microtubules while it lacks the axial pair of microtubules, making its structure very similar to the cilia of neurons, Schwann cells, and astrocytes of the CNS.|$|E
25|$|ADPKD, {{together}} {{with many other}} diseases that present with renal cysts, can be classified into a family of diseases known as ciliopathies. Epithelial cells of the renal tubules, including all the segments of the nephron and the collecting ducts (with the exception of intercalated cells) show {{the presence of a}} single primary apical <b>cilium.</b> Polycystin-1, the protein encoded by the PKD1 gene, is present on these cilia and is thought to sense the flow with its large extracellular domains, activating the calcium channels associated with polycystin-2, the product of gene PKD2, {{as a result of the}} genetic setting of ADPKD as explained in the genetics sub-section below.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen (2002) {{views the}} phoronids and brachiopods [...] as {{affiliated}} with the deuterostome pterobranchs, which also filter-feed by tentacles, because the current-driving cells of the lophophores of all three have one <b>cilium</b> per cell, while lophophores of bryozoans, which he regards as protostomes, have multiple cilia per cell. Helmkampf, Bruchhaus and Hausdorf (2008) summarise several authors' embryological and morphological analyses which doubt or disagree that phoronids and brachiopods are deuterostomes: ...|$|E
2500|$|Microtubules {{have a major}} {{structural}} role in eukaryotic cilia and flagella. Cilia and flagella always extend {{directly from}} a MTOC, in this case termed the basal body. The action of the dynein motor proteins on the various microtubule strands that run along a <b>cilium</b> or flagellum allows the organelle to bend and generate force for swimming, moving extracellular material, and other roles. [...] Prokaryotes possess tubulin-like proteins including FtsZ. However, prokaryotic flagella are entirely different in structure from eukaryotic flagella and do not contain microtubule-based structures.|$|E
2500|$|Behe next {{introduces}} {{and defines}} {{the concept of}} irreducible complexity as a system {{with a series of}} parts in which the removal of any part causes the entire system to cease functioning, offering a spring-loaded bar mousetrap as a familiar example. [...] In the following chapters, Behe discusses the apparent irreducible complexity of several biological systems, including the <b>cilium,</b> the bacterial flagellum, blood clotting, the immune system, and vesicular transport. [...] Behe claims the underlying complexity and biochemical mechanisms of the systems are vastly under-appreciated, and identifies other, similar systems.|$|E
2500|$|Axonemal dyneins come in {{multiple}} forms that contain either one, {{two or three}} non-identical heavy chains (depending upon the organism and location in the <b>cilium).</b> Each heavy chain has a globular motor domain with a doughnut-shaped structure believed to resemble that of other AAA proteins, [...] a coiled coil [...] "stalk" [...] that binds to the microtubule, and an extended tail (or [...] "stem") that attaches to a neighboring microtubule of the same axoneme. Each dynein molecule thus forms a cross-bridge between two adjacent microtubules of the ciliary axoneme. During the [...] "power stroke", which causes movement, the AAA ATPase motor domain undergoes a conformational change that causes the microtubule-binding stalk to pivot relative to the cargo-binding tail {{with the result that}} one microtubule slides relative to the other (Karp, 2005). [...] This sliding produces the bending movement needed for cilia to beat and propel the cell or other particles. [...] Groups of dynein molecules responsible for movement in opposite directions are probably activated and inactivated in a coordinated fashion so that the cilia or flagella can move back and forth. The radial spoke has been proposed as the (or one of the) structures that synchronizes this movement.|$|E
60|$|The little {{creature}} thus described sometimes propelled {{itself with}} great activity, with a curious rolling motion, by the lashing {{of the front}} <b>cilium,</b> while the second <b>cilium</b> trailed behind; sometimes it anchored itself by the hinder <b>cilium</b> and was spun round by the working of the other, its motions resembling those of an anchor buoy in a heavy sea. Sometimes, when two were in full career towards one another, each would appear dexterously {{to get out of}} the other's way; sometimes a crowd would assemble and jostle one another, with as much semblance of individual effort as a spectator on the Grands Mulets might observe with a telescope among the specks representing men in the valley of Chamounix.|$|E
60|$|Full-sized {{specimens}} of this animalcule attain {{a length of}} between 1/300 or 1/400 of an inch, so {{that it may have}} ten times the length and a thousand times the mass of a Heteromita. In shape, it is not altogether unlike Heteromita. The small end, however, is not produced into one long <b>cilium,</b> but the general surface of the body is covered with small actively vibrating ciliary organs, which are only longest at the small end. At the point which answers to that from which the two cilia arise in Heteromita, there is a conical depression, the mouth; and, in young specimens, a tapering filament, which reminds one of the posterior <b>cilium</b> of Heteromita, projects from this region.|$|E
60|$|But the {{difference}} in the phaenomena to which it will give rise is immense: in the first place it will develop a vast quantity of physical force--cleaving the water in all directions with considerable rapidity by means of the vibrations of the long filament or <b>cilium.</b>|$|E
60|$|But other active organisms, {{very much}} larger than the Bacteria, {{attaining}} in fact the comparatively gigantic dimensions of 1/3000 of an inch or more, incessantly crossed the field of view. Each of these had a body shaped like a pear, the small end being slightly incurved and produced into a long curved filament, or <b>cilium,</b> of extreme tenuity. Behind this, from the concave side of the incurvation, proceeded another long <b>cilium,</b> so delicate as to be discernible only by the use of the highest powers and careful management of the light. In the centre of the pear-shaped body a clear round space could occasionally be discerned, but not always; and careful watching showed that this clear vacuity appeared gradually, and then shut up and disappeared suddenly, at regular intervals. Such a structure is of common occurrence among the lowest plants and animals, and is known as a contractile vacuole.|$|E
60|$|Their Heteromita, however, multiplied rapidly by fission. Sometimes a {{transverse}} constriction appeared; the hinder half {{developed a}} new <b>cilium,</b> and the hinder <b>cilium</b> gradually split from its base to its free end, until it was divided into two; a process which, {{considering the fact that}} this fine filament cannot be much more than 1/100000 of an inch in diameter, is wonderful enough. The constriction of the body extended inwards until the two portions were united by a narrow isthmus; finally, they separated and each swam away by itself, a complete Heteromita, provided with its two cilia. Sometimes the constriction took a longitudinal direction, with the same ultimate result. In each case the process occupied not more than six or seven minutes. At this rate, a single Heteromita would give rise to a thousand like itself in the course of an hour, to about a million in two hours, and to a number greater than the generally assumed number of human beings now living in the world in three hours; or, if we give each Heteromita an hour's enjoyment of individual existence, the same result will be obtained in about a day. The apparent suddenness of the appearance of multitudes of such organisms as these in any nutritive fluid to which one obtains access is thus easily explained.|$|E
60|$|In structure, {{however, the}} Peronospora {{is as much}} a mould as the common Penicillium; and just as the Penicillium multiplies by the {{breaking}} up of its hyphoe into separate rounded bodies, the spores; so, in the Peronospora, certain of the hyphoe grow out into the air through the interstices of the superficial cells of the potato plant, and develop spores. Each of these hyphoe usually gives off several branches. The ends of the branches dilate and become closed sacs, which eventually drop off as spores. The spores falling on some part of the same potato plant, or carried by the wind to another, may at once germinate, throwing out tubular prolongations which become hyphoe, and burrow into the substance of the plant attacked. But, more commonly, the contents of the spore divide into six or eight separate portions. The coat of the spore gives way, and each portion then emerges as an independent organism, which has the shape of a bean, rather narrower at one end than the other, convex on one side, and depressed or concave on the opposite. From the depression, two long and delicate cilia proceed, one shorter than the other, and directed forwards. Close to the origin of these cilia, in the substance of the body, is a regularly pulsating, contractile vacuole. The shorter <b>cilium</b> vibrates actively, and effects the locomotion of the organism, while the other trails behind; the whole body rolling on its axis with its pointed end forwards.|$|E
50|$|Like its Chlamydomonas ortholog, FAP256, it {{has been}} shown to {{localize}} to the distal ends of both centrioles {{in the absence of a}} <b>cilium.</b> During <b>cilium</b> formation, it is found at the tip of the elongating <b>cilium.</b>|$|E
50|$|Proteins must be {{synthesized}} in the cytoplasm of {{the cell}} and cannot be synthesized within cilia. For the <b>cilium</b> to elongate, proteins must be selectively imported from the cytoplasm into the <b>cilium</b> and transported {{to the tip of}} the <b>cilium</b> by intraflagellar transport (IFT). Once the <b>cilium</b> is completely formed, it continues to incorporate new tubulin {{at the tip of the}} cilia. However, the <b>cilium</b> does not elongate further, because older tubulin is simultaneously degraded. This requires an active mechanism that maintains ciliary length. Impairments in these mechanisms can affect the motility {{of the cell}} and cell signaling between cells.|$|E
5000|$|Adetomyrma <b>cilium</b> (from Latin <b>cilium,</b> [...] "eyelash", {{referring}} to the long hairs on its compound eye) is a species of ant endemic to Madagascar.|$|E
50|$|Adetomyrma <b>cilium</b> is {{only known}} from males. The male of A. <b>cilium</b> is {{distinguished}} easily {{from the other}} Adetomyrma males {{by a combination of}} long hairs on the eye, long suberect hairs on the anterior surface of the mesofemur, and a well-developed subpetiolar process.|$|E
50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} localizes {{to the primary}} <b>cilium</b> and to the plasma membrane. The gene {{functions}} in centriole migration to the apical membrane and formation of the primary <b>cilium.</b> Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.|$|E
5000|$|The radial spoke {{is known}} {{to play a role}} in the {{mechanical}} movement of the flagellum/cilium. For example, mutant organisms lacking properly functioning radial spokes have flagella and cilia that are immotile. Radial spokes also influence the <b>cilium</b> [...] "waveform"; that is, the exact bending pattern the <b>cilium</b> repeats.|$|E
50|$|Choanozoa {{have been}} {{described}} as possessing a posterior <b>cilium.</b>|$|E
50|$|Intraflagellar {{transport}} protein 81 homolog is a protein that in humans is encoded by the IFT81 gene. Together with IFT74/72 {{it forms a}} core complex to build IFT particles which are required for <b>cilium</b> formation. Additionally, it interacts with basal body components as CEP170 which regulates the disassembly of the <b>cilium.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Paramecium propels {{itself by}} {{whiplash}} {{movements of the}} cilia, which are arranged in tightly spaced rows around {{the outside of the}} body. The beat of each <b>cilium</b> has two phases: a fast [...] "effective stroke," [...] during which the <b>cilium</b> is relatively stiff, followed by a slow [...] "recovery stroke," [...] during which the <b>cilium</b> curls loosely to one side and sweeps forward in a counter-clockwise fashion. The densely arrayed cilia move in a coordinated fashion, with waves of activity moving across the [...] "ciliary carpet," [...] creating an effect sometimes likened to that of the wind blowing across a field of grain.|$|E

5000|$|The TBC1D32 protein {{has a role}} in many {{biological}} processes including determination of left/right symmetry, embryonic digit morphogenesis, heart development, lens development in camera-type eye, non-motile <b>cilium</b> assembly, protein localization to <b>cilium,</b> retinal pigment epithelium development, and smoothened signaling pathway involved in dorsal/ventral neural tube patterning. This protein is classified as a developmental protein.|$|E
50|$|In addition, Transportin-1 is {{implicated in}} helping protein {{transport}} into primary <b>cilium.</b> The function of Transportin-1 {{in this case}} is thought to be similar to carrying proteins into the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Transportin-1 binds cargo and then is helping this cargo to pass through a pore {{at the base of the}} <b>cilium.</b> Ran and nucleoporins are also implicated in this mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the base}} of the <b>cilium</b> where it {{attaches}} to the cell body is the microtubule organizing center, the basal body. Some basal body proteins as CEP164, ODF2 and CEP170, regulate the formation and the stability of the <b>cilium.</b> A transition zone between the basal body and the axoneme [...] "serves as a docking station for intraflagellar transport and motor proteins." ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Cilium</b> {{construction}} of axoneme microtubules movement by the sliding of dynein protein was cited by Behe {{as an example}} of irreducible complexity. [...] He further said that the advances in knowledge in the subsequent 10 years had shown that the complexity of intraflagellar transport for two hundred components <b>cilium</b> and many other cellular structures is substantially greater than was known earlier.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the primary}} <b>cilium</b> was {{discovered}} in 1898, it was largely ignored for a century. Only recently has great progress been made in understanding {{the function of the}} primary <b>cilium.</b> Until the 1990s, the prevailing view of the primary <b>cilium</b> was that it was merely a vestigial organelle without important function. [...] Recent findings regarding its physiological roles in chemical sensation, signal transduction, and control of cell growth, have led scientists to acknowledge its importance in cell function, with the discovery of its role in diseases not previously recognized to involve the dysgenesis and dysfunction of cilia, such as polycystic kidney disease, congenital heart disease, and an emerging group of genetic ciliopathies. The primary <b>cilium</b> is now known {{to play an important role}} in the function of many human organs.The current scientific understanding of primary cilia views them as [...] "sensory cellular antennae that coordinate a large number of cellular signaling pathways, sometimes coupling the signaling to ciliary motility or alternatively to cell division and differentiation.".|$|E

50|$|Galectin-3 {{associates}} {{with the primary}} <b>cilium</b> and modulates renal cyst growth in congenital polycystic kidney disease.|$|E
50|$|These models {{argue that}} cilia {{developed}} from pre-existing {{components of the}} eukaryotic cytoskeleton (which has tubulin and dynein also used for other functions) {{as an extension of}} the mitotic spindle apparatus. The connection can still be seen, first in the various early-branching single-celled eukaryotes that have a microtubule basal body, where microtubules on one end form a spindle-like cone around the nucleus, while microtubules on the other end point away from the cell and form the <b>cilium.</b> A further connection is that the centriole, involved in the formation of the mitotic spindle in many (but not all) eukaryotes, is homologous to the <b>cilium,</b> and in many cases is the basal body from which the <b>cilium</b> grows.|$|E
