This study focuses on two issues: the power loss and <b>charging</b> <b>cost</b> optimization. The multi-objective particle swarm optimization technique is applied to achieve the optimal charging schedule, resulting in acceptable additional power loss ratio and <b>charging</b> <b>cost.</b> The power loss on electric lines is correlated to the load demand. However,due {{to the complexity of}} the distribution network including the transformers and unbalances of loads,it is necessary to understand the power loss-load demand model. The loss-load modelling is based on the distribution network structure and power flow analysis. The two classic distribution networks (IEEE 13 -Node and IEEE 34 -Node) are employed for power flow analysis. As the consequence of power flow analysis,a new power loss-load demand model is presented. In this thesis, the additional power loss ratio (APLR) is analysed to present the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) impact of power losses on distribution network.

The business owner will need to choose whether to power the DCFC on the original business service electrical supply or provide separate service to the DCFC. Detailed analysis of potential costs and the electric utility rate schedule options to determine the optimal rate schedule for a DCFC site is important and should be conducted in consultation with the electric utility. Some electric utilities provide rate schedules for commercial customers without imposing demand charges. When demand charges are imposed by utilities, they can cause a monthly utility bill to increase by as much as four times. DCFC site hosts may be compensated for energy used in DCFC charging through access or use fees imposed on plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) drivers in those states that allow energy billing, but demand charges are typically uncompensated and can be significant. The host’s monthly DCFC demand charge is based on the single highest power required by the DCFC during the month, regardless of the number of charge events in the month.

However, the associated operating cost of redundancy system is very high. The common redundancies used in a cogeneration power plant are public utility and generator set.

To be able to minimize <b>costs</b> and schedule <b>charging</b> sessions, there has to be knowledge of how the charging power varies with time. This is called charging profile. A number of charging profiles for a Volvo V 60 plug‑in hybrid electric vehicle have been recorded. For charging currents above 10  A they prove to be more complex than are assumed in most current research papers.   The charging profiles are used together with historical electricity prices to calculate <b>charging</b> <b>costs</b> for 2013 and 2014. Charging is assumed to take place during the night, between 18 : 00 and 07 : 00, with the battery being totally depleted at 18 : 00. By using a timer to have the charging start at 01 : 00, instead of immediately at 18 : 00, annual <b>charging</b> <b>costs</b> are reduced by approximately 7  to  8 %.

40|$|Ownership matters. It affects {{residual}} {{rights under}} incomplete contracts and, therefore, incentives. The {{first chapter of}} this thesis analyzes in how far ownership can be substituted by other economic factors. Contrary to an assumption {{found in the literature}} market foreclosure can be achieved without vertical integration in the following scenarios: repeated games, reputation games, and also in a finitely repeated game when there are switching costs. The main chapter is concerned with implications of ownership in regulated industries where a monopolistic supplier of an essential input is required by a regulator to <b>charge</b> <b>cost</b> based prices. Our analysis focuses on the impact of ownership on the monopolist's incentives to exploit informational asymmetries about production costs. We conduct a comparative study of vertical integration, vertical separation, and joint ownership. Effects on welfare, investments incentives, and entry are analyzed for each ownership structure. Joint ownership performs best. Accounting separation is shown to be generally ineffective as regulatory instrument. We use an alternative model which allows to take into account network duplication. Starting from a free market analysis of equilibrium pricing and entry decisions we explore the relation between ownership and the degree of regulation required in order to ensure efficient outcomes. Two part tariffs, network duplication, price discrimination and a long-term commitment to fixed input prices induce reductions of final prices. The final part of this thesis investigates results in the theory of competitive market equilibrium. Many of these results rely on restrictive assumptions on consumer behaviour. We analyze in how far traditional equilibrium theory is robust against a relaxation of underlying assumptions. We do not assume agents to be rational in the sense that their choices arise from maximisation. Randomly fluctuating demand is allowed for and consequences for predictions made by traditional competitive equilibrium theory are re-examined...|$|E

The major or main determinants involved in assessment were identified in the amount of chicken sold in one production year were channeled through the number of years in chicken keeping (experience), the total cost used in chicken production and the total interest borrowed with farmer in month and direct income received after selling of the commodity from farmers to consumers and deduct total cost encountered during operation. Results obtained from the model indicated that sex of entrepreneur, family size, education level of entrepreneur, number of training attended with farmers were the variables that influence the live chicken production negatively. The results obtained further showed that majority of the poultry farmers were in the age range of between 35 and 55 years had positively respond to chicken keeping and revealed youth poultry farmers were not fully economically efficient in the use of chicken production. The study concluded by making suggestions which could improve the broilers production among the farmers in the study area and in Tanzania as a whole. Therefore, policy aimed to accelerate agricultural development in poultry production and marketing could be successful if the aforementioned determinants for the chicken production are taken in to consideration. ...|$|E

50|$|With {{respect to}} <b>cost</b> <b>charge</b> out a {{critical}} issue is that <b>costs</b> <b>charged</b> based on activity based costing (ABC) do not provide an incentive to the shared service center to be efficient because ABC implies {{that the costs of}} non-used over capacity will be charged out as well. It is better to <b>cost</b> <b>charge</b> out on time-driven activity based costing. The superior solution for <b>cost</b> <b>charge</b> out is <b>cost</b> allocation based on the deployment of a corporate wide general ledger, which includes the recording of the internal use of resources for products and customers. This method eliminates the effect of double marginalization inherent to transfer prices and subsequently improves the performance of the firm.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we analyze a {{framework}} of charging Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) where the electric utility (or aggregator) sets time-dependent prices for charging, and the PEVs choose their charging profiles so as to minimize their individual <b>charging</b> <b>costs</b> (maximize individual profits). We show that there exists pricing policies that results in social optimality (i. e., minimize the network-wide <b>charging</b> <b>cost,</b> or maximize the total economic surplus) under individually rational (selfish) decision-making by the PEVs. The pricing policy is non-linear and can differ across PEVs, and {{takes into account the}} uncertainty in the user (PEV-owner) charging preferences which are in general not known to the utility, but can possibly be stochastically estimated (predicted) through observations over time. We evaluate the proposed pricing policy through simulations, in terms of the mean and variance of the total electric load on a sample distribution network. I...|$|R
