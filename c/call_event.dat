Although if communications during the 9/11 attacks or after a major hurricane are anything to go by, and the cell phone network towers survive, the service would be overloaded(a Mass <b>call</b> <b>event)</b> and thereby made useless soon after; however, if prior arrangements between the cell network and emergency responders are made to give them priority and bar access to all other individuals, then it may be an effective service. However, as Civil defense(CD) shelters, as depicted in the film, were stocked for such an eventuality, they contained amongst other things, at least one CDV-715 radiation survey meter and a CD emergency radio receiver which would respectively be used to facilitate a safe delayed evacuation, regardless of outside help and if communications continued, inform them of the outside situation as it developed.|$|E

50|$|A mass <b>call</b> <b>event</b> or mass calling event (also MCE in {{telephony}} usage) is {{a situation}} in which an extraordinarily high number of telephone calls are attempted into or out of an area, causing tremendous network congestion, and therefore service which is either significantly degraded or potentially almost completely unavailable.|$|E
50|$|The {{volume of}} network traffic {{can also cause}} calls to be blocked or dropped due to a {{disaster}} or other mass <b>call</b> <b>event</b> which overloads the number of available radio channels in an area, {{or the number of}} telephone circuits connecting to and from the general public switched telephone network.|$|E

5000|$|It is even {{possible}} to directly measure {{the performance of}} print advertising. The publisher prints a special telephone number in the advertisement, used nowhere else. When a consumer places a call to that number, the <b>call</b> <b>event</b> is recorded and the call is routed to the regular number. In theory, the call {{could only have been}} generated because of the print advertisement. In practice, there is the risk that an inadvertent third party will find a number from an advertisement and submit it to an online or printed directory, causing it to receive additional calls for which the advertiser must pay individually as [...] "leads" [...] or enquiries. Some of the received calls may be misdirected product support requests from existing clients or even enquiries from suppliers, which are not new revenue and should not be counted as new leads. Toll-free telephone numbers are also notoriously prone to misdials which a company must pay to receive - often because a little-used number is one digit away from a major airline, hotel chain, hire car firm, bank or national franchise operator.|$|E

Individuals tracked by the system were required to provide multiple means of contact - including physical addresses, and home, office and mobile radio telephone numbers - and to notify the Central Locator any time they left the city of Washington, D.C., providing their itinerary and places of residence while traveling. During a national emergency, tracked persons were instructed to contact the Central Locator using either landline phone or the Defense Communications System and provide details on their exact whereabouts. In the event of a mass <b>call</b> <b>event</b> that prevented persons in the line of succession from reporting their location to the Central Locator, they were authorized to call the telephone operator and use the message precedence order [...] "FLASH" [...] to override all other line traffic and force through a call.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{protocol}} synthesis method {{based on a}} partial order model (<b>called</b> <b>event</b> structures) for the class of context-free processes. First, we assign a unique name <b>called</b> <b>event</b> ID to every event executable by a given service specification. An event ID is a finite sequence of symbols derived from the context-free process specification. Then we show that some interesting sets of events are expressible by regular expressions on symbols, and that the event structure can be finitely represented {{by a set of}} relations among the regular expressions. Finally, we present a method to derive a protocol specification which implements a given service specification on distributed nodes, by using the obtained finite representation of event structures. The derived protocol specification contains the minimum message exchanges necessary to ensure the partial order of events of the service specification...|$|R

In an appendix I give axiomatic formulations of my ontological views. Comment: Accepted for publication in Foundations of Science, 23 page...|$|E
