5|$|The {{role of the}} sea {{in human}} culture has been {{important}} for centuries, as people experience the sea in contradictory ways: as powerful but serene, beautiful but dangerous. Human responses to the sea {{can be found in}} artforms including literature, art, poetry, film, theatre, and classical music. The earliest art representing boats is 40,000 years old. Since then, artists in different countries and cultures have depicted the sea. Symbolically, the sea has been perceived as a hostile environment populated by fantastic creatures: the Leviathan of the Bible, Isonade in Japanese mythology, and the kraken of late Norse mythology. In the works of the psychiatrist Carl Jung, the sea symbolises the personal and the <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious</b> in dream interpretation.|$|E
5|$|Retaining an {{interest}} in class and race-based radicalism, she established contacts with various far right activists in the neighboring United States, including Willis Carto and James K. Warner, the latter being the New York organizer of the American Nazi Party. Warner had earlier attempted to establish Odinism as a religious wing of the American Nazi movement, but having believed {{this to be a}} failure he gave Christensen all of his leftover material on Odinism. It was in this material that Christensen came across the Call of Our Ancient Nordic Religion, a pamphlet authored by the Australian Odinist Alexander Rud Mills. Although Christensen believed that many of Mills' ideas were too heavily influenced by Freemasonry for her liking, she was profoundly influenced by his ideas about reviving the worship of ancient Norse deities. Her approach to the understanding of such deities would be heavily influenced by Jungian psychology, believing that the Norse deities were encoded in a <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious</b> of the white race.|$|E
25|$|Jung {{distinguished}} between the personal unconscious and the <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious.</b> To find the positive therapeutic direction as impartially as he could, Jung identified and interpreted dream images {{generated by the}} <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious</b> in a constructive way rather than reducing them to personal indications. Since collective themes are common to all humanity, they find their counterpart in mythological motifs.|$|E
50|$|How {{does one}} {{actually}} set about distorting history? The {{best and most}} effective method of course is invention, supported by fabrication. One invents events, and if convenient or necessary one fabricates the evidence to support one’s inventions. A fabrication may be personal and deliberate; it may be <b>collective</b> and <b>unconscious.</b> Both kinds can usually be detected by critical historical scholarship.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the opening}} of his book, 7 Secrets of Marketing, he says, [...] "Cultures, like individuals, have an {{unconscious}}. This unconscious is active in each of us, making us do things we might not be aware of." [...] This <b>collective</b> cultural <b>unconscious</b> can be further defined as a pool of shared imprinting experiences that unconsciously pre-organize and influence {{the behavior of a}} culture.|$|R
50|$|Jung's {{suggestion}} that Hitler personified the <b>collective</b> Aryan <b>unconscious</b> deeply interested and influenced Miguel Serrano, who later concluded that Jung was merely psychologizing the ancient, sacred mystery of archetypal possession by the gods, independent metaphysical powers that rule over their respective races and occasionally possess their members. A similar esoteric thesis is also {{put forward by}} Michael Moynihan in his book Lords of Chaos.|$|R
25|$|In Jungian psychology, archetypes {{are highly}} {{developed}} {{elements of the}} <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious.</b> Being unconscious, the existence of archetypes can only be deduced indirectly by examining behavior, images, art, myths, religions, or dreams. Carl Jung understood archetypes as universal, archaic patterns and images that derive from the <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious</b> and are the psychic counterpart of instinct. They are inherited potentials which are actualized when they enter consciousness as images or manifest in behavior on interaction with the outside world. They are autonomous and hidden forms which are transformed once they enter consciousness and are given particular expression by individuals and their cultures.|$|E
25|$|The {{swastika}} is a repeating design, said to {{have been}} created by the edges of the reeds in a square basket-weave. Other theories attempt to establish a connection via cultural diffusion or an explanation along the lines of Carl Jung's <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious.</b>|$|E
25|$|Archetypes are innate {{universal}} pre-conscious psychic dispositions {{that form}} the substrate from which the basic themes of human life emerge. The archetypes are components of the <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious</b> and serve to organize, direct and inform human thought and behaviour. Archetypes hold control of the human life cycle.|$|E

5000|$|Rapaille {{developed}} his theory {{on the brain}} after working as a psychologist for autistic children and studying Konrad Lorenz theory of Imprints and John Bowlby theory of attachment. [...] This work led him to believe that while children learn a given word and the idea connected with it, they associate it with certain emotions. He called that primal emotional association an imprint. This imprint determines our attitude towards a particular thing. These pooled individual imprints make up a <b>collective</b> cultural <b>unconscious,</b> which unconsciously pre-organize and influence {{the behavior of a}} culture.|$|R
25|$|Among {{the central}} {{concepts}} of analytical psychology is individuation—the lifelong psychological process of differentiation {{of the self}} out of each individual's conscious and unconscious elements. Jung considered {{it to be the}} main task of human development. He created some of the best known psychological concepts, including synchronicity, archetypal phenomena, the <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious,</b> the psychological complex, and extraversion and introversion.|$|E
25|$|Carl Jung also applied psychoanalytic {{theory to}} art. C.G. Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist, an {{influential}} thinker, {{and founder of}} analytical psychology. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the psyche through exploring the worlds of dreams, art, mythology, world religion and philosophy. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, alchemy, astrology, sociology, as well as literature and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological archetype, the <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious,</b> and his theory of synchronicity. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as coincidence were not merely due to chance but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic. He argued that a <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious</b> and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American Abstract expressionists in the 1940s and 1950s. His work inspired the surrealist concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.|$|E
25|$|Archetypes {{abound in}} {{contemporary}} films and literature {{as they have}} in creative works of the past, being unconscious projections of the <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious</b> that serve to embody central societal and developmental struggles in a media that entertain as well as instruct. Films are a contemporary form of mythmaking, reflecting our response to ourselves and the mysteries and wonders of our existence.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1949 book The Hero with a Thousand Faces, Joseph Campbell {{advanced}} {{the theory that}} a single myth stood behind the stories of Krishna, Buddha, Apollonius of Tyana, Jesus, and other hero stories. [...] In his later The Masks of God: Occidental Mythology Campbell stated [...] "(i)t is clear that, whether accurate or not as to biographical detail, the moving legend of the Crucified and Risen Christ was fit to bring a new warmth, immediacy, and humanity, to the old motifs of the beloved Tammuz, Adonis, and Osiris cycles." [...] Alexander Jacob suggests that the Jesus story was the Judaized, historicized version of a very ancient myth which {{can be described as}} archetypal (i.e. its origins ultimately lie rooted in the <b>collective</b> human <b>unconscious).</b>|$|R
40|$|Psychoanalysis has {{now been}} {{established}} as another aspect of art criticism. Amongst many writers who attempted to create a theory of Aesthetics is the Swiss psychiatrist, and father of analytical psychology, Carl Jung. Unlike Freud, Jung did not see art structured along sexual lines but in archetypes, which may be those of the <b>collective</b> or personal <b>unconscious.</b> For him art was a creative process not a neurosis. In his theory of aesthetics Jung established that the artist expresses archetypes consciously or unconsciously. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a story {{written by}} a four-year-old girl that includes a total of 18 pictures which she entitled “The Little Princess and Her Butterfly. ” This paper focuses mainly on the verbal messages. Its purpose {{is to examine the}} child’s story solely as an expression of a collective narrative following a pattern that “was established long before man developed a reflective consciousness ” (Jung, 1983, p. 76). This story can be seen as an unprocessed primordial kernel bound to <b>unconscious,</b> <b>collective</b> archetypal content and processes indicative of a universal developmental myth...|$|R
25|$|Automatic {{writing was}} an {{important}} vehicle for action painters Franz Kline (in his black and white paintings), Jackson Pollock, Mark Tobey and Cy Twombly, who used gesture, surface, and line to create calligraphic, linear symbols and skeins that resemble language, and resonate as powerful manifestations from the <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious.</b> Robert Motherwell in his Elegy to the Spanish Republic series also painted powerful black and white paintings using gesture, surface and symbol evoking powerful emotional charges.|$|E
25|$|Carl Jung {{believed}} that the <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious,</b> which reflects the cosmic order {{and the history of}} the human species, is {{the most important part of}} the mind. It contains archetypes, which are manifested in symbols that appear in dreams, disturbed states of mind, and various products of culture. Jungians are less interested in infantile development and psychological conflict between wishes and the forces that frustrate them than in integration between different parts of the person. The object of Jungian therapy was to mend such splits. Jung focused in particular on problems of middle and later life. His objective was to allow people to experience the split-off aspects of themselves, such as the anima (a man's suppressed female self), the animus (a woman's suppressed male self), or the shadow (an inferior self-image), and thereby attain wisdom.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{childhood}} memories made lifelong impressions on him. As a boy, he carved a tiny mannequin {{into the end}} of the wooden ruler from his pencil case and placed it inside the case. He added a stone, which he had painted into upper and lower halves, and hid the case in the attic. Periodically, he would return to the mannequin, often bringing tiny sheets of paper with messages inscribed on them in his own secret language. He later reflected that this ceremonial act brought him a feeling of inner peace and security. Years later, he discovered similarities between his personal experience and the practices associated with totems in indigenous cultures, such as the collection of soul-stones near Arlesheim or the tjurungas of Australia. He concluded that his intuitive ceremonial act was an unconscious ritual, which he had practiced {{in a way that was}} strikingly similar to those in distant locations which he, as a young boy, knew nothing about. His observations about symbols, archetypes, and the <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious</b> were inspired, in part, by these early experiences combined with his later research.|$|E
40|$|Infertility {{has always}} {{been seen as a}} plague, a curse arousing both scientist's and charlatan's interest. Regarded as an {{exclusively}} female pathology, its etiology did generate many speculations. This symptom awakes the imaginary and create contrasted attitudes depending from the societies and times. In spite of remarkable scientific progress on this matter, the way patients talk about it still the heritage of the myths, the taboos and prohibition present in our <b>unconscious</b> <b>collectives.</b> Through the clinical history of Ariane, we will see the irrational allows a mythological construction which defines and protects the patient's identity.

50|$|It {{is still}} more {{intriguing}} for the local population. The popular tradition in Kfarsghab attributes its particular accent to the special characteristics of the drinking water. From sociological point of view, a major difference in accent between neighboring settlements denotes usually either geographical isolation, or an <b>unconscious</b> <b>collective</b> will of identity conservation. It {{is true that the}} winter village, Morh Kfarsghab, is relatively isolated but for the original village, Kfarsghab, which was used for the major part of the year, geography is not an evident reason. The explanation for the difference has to be found somewhere else.|$|R
5000|$|In his {{interview}} with Metal Injection, Amos Williams stated {{that the decision to}} drop harsh vocals entirely from future material was an <b>unconscious</b> <b>collective</b> decision by the band and this made the search for a new vocalist extremely hard; his explanation was that many vocalists with an all clean style do not want to live the [...] "metal" [...] lifestyle of regular touring, or do not enjoy metal music enough to want {{to take part in a}} band in Tesseract's style. While Altered State did not feature any harsh vocals whatsoever, Polaris sparingly makes use of harsh vocals on the songs Messenger and Cages.|$|R
25|$|The {{combined}} group eventually explores {{all four}} labyrinths, successfully unlocking the {{doors in the}} Velvet Room and restoring Zen's memories. He reveals that his true identity is the human avatar of Chronos, a manifestation of death created by the <b>Collective</b> <b>Unconscious,</b> and Rei is really a girl named Niko who died of illness twelve years prior. When Chronos came to escort her to the afterlife, he was intrigued by her descent into nihilism {{as a result of}} having lived an apparently meaningless life. Chronos created the alternate Yasogami High, split himself into Zen and a powerful being known as the Clockwork God, and sealed both of their memories {{in order to try to}} bring Rei happiness. The Clockwork God is the one responsible for trapping SEES and the Investigation Team in the alternate Yasogami, hoping for them to traverse the labyrinths and recover Zen's memories so they can merge and become Chronos once again: this would result in the teams being erased from time when their tasks were completed. The Clockwork God abducts Rei and transports her to the top of a clock tower outside the school. SEES and the Investigation Team decide to help Zen rescue Rei, and they ascend the tower and defeat the Clockwork God. After spending some carefree time together before the pocket dimension collapses, Zen and Rei vanish into the afterlife, while SEES and the Investigation Team promise to meet again someday and return home, although their memories of the incident are erased.|$|E

500|$|A central {{concept for}} the series is the <b>Collective</b> <b>Unconscious,</b> a place {{generated}} by the hearts of humanity and from which Personas are born. According to the official Persona Club P3 book, the <b>Collective</b> <b>Unconscious</b> was generated by the primitive life on Earth {{as a means of}} containing the spiritual essence of Nyx, a space-born being whose presence would cause the death of all life on Earth. Her body was damaged by the impact and became the moon, while her psyche was left on the surface and locked away {{at the heart of the}} <b>Collective</b> <b>Unconscious.</b> The fragments of Nyx's psyche, known as [...] "Shadows", are both a threat and a crucial part of humanity's existence. To further help defend against hostile Shadows, people generated the deities that exist within the <b>Collective</b> <b>Unconscious,</b> many of which manifest as Personas. Nyx appears in Persona 3 as the antagonist. The major dungeon locations in each game (such as Tartarus in Persona 3 and the Palace in Persona 5) are generated by the latent wishes or anxieties of humans, and are generally used by another force for their own ends. A recurring location is the Velvet Room, a place between reality and unconsciousness created by Philemon that changes form depending on the psyche of its current guest. Its inhabitants, especially an enigmatic old man called Igor, aid the main characters by helping them hone their Persona abilities.|$|E

50|$|Trigg’s most {{important}} book is Congenial Souls. It applies {{the insights of}} critical cultural analysis to a field that {{tends to be more}} conventionally concerned with either literary description of Chaucer’s work or depiction of his life and times. Instead, Trigg's book analyses the critical literature on Geoffrey Chaucer across the six-hundred-year period from his death in 1400 to the present, arguing that this long history of reading and writing about Chaucer is marked by a distinctive social process. Trigg argues that imagined and idealised reading communities formed around Chaucer’s works, driven by the <b>unconscious,</b> <b>collective</b> desire to speak with Chaucer, and to become part of his own intimate circle of friends and other poets.|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{the authors}} draw on Lorenzer's method in our {{analysis}} of a single case data extract derived from a research project generating data through the Tavistock Infant Observation tradition. The partial case analysis demonstrates our methodological approach and explores conceptual territory at the meeting point of German and British psychoanalytically-informed traditions. Their scenic composition synthesised key elements of one observation visit {{to the home of}} a young black first-time mother in London. Lorenzer's advice to the cultural analyst to explore what irritates or provokes in the scene has something in common with the way that observers in the infant observation tradition use their emotional responses and process their experience. The aim is to provide access to what Winnicott described as an intermediate area of experience and Lorenzer considered 'in-between'. The authors explore this area through two provocations in our scenic composition. Using these data examples we ask: is it possible to conceptualise <b>collective,</b> societal-cultural <b>unconscious</b> processes (Lorenzer's gesellschaftlich-kollektives Unbewußtes, 1986) within this intermediate area? Specifically, how is racial and class difference present in the scene? How can it be located through scenic understanding of research data? And why does it matter?" (author's abstract...|$|R
500|$|Although {{not present}} in every New Age group, a core belief within the milieu is in channeling.

These sources are varyingly described as being God, gods and goddesses, ascended masters, spirit guides, extraterrestrials, angels, devas, historical figures, the <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious,</b> elementals, or nature spirits. Hanegraaff described channeling as a form of [...] "articulated revelation", and identified four forms: trance channeling, automatisms, clairaudient channeling, and open channeling.|$|E

Many of the characters come from two high schools in Sumaru: , a prestigious school that is the setting of Innocent Sin, and the less-prestigious [...] All the protagonists wield Personas, manifestations of their personalities. The ability to wield Personas was granted to them by Philemon, a benevolent personification of humanity's <b>Collective</b> <b>Unconscious.</b> The events of Innocent Sin are said to stem from a contest between Philemon and his opposite Nyarlathotep to see if humans could find a higher purpose in life despite embracing contradictory emotions. During the events of Innocent Sin, Nyarlathotep influenced events in his favor and all the world except Sumaru City was destroyed. In order to reset events, the party used the power of the <b>Collective</b> <b>Unconscious</b> to will the key event that caused the events of Innocent Sin out of existence in exchange for their memories of those events: this created an alternate timeline, with the Innocent Sin timeline existing as a separate [...] "Other Side".

Seeking to enhance the creative potential of their employees, many seemingly progressive organisations utilise an array of methodologies - from creating culture of fun and play, to commissioning beautifully designed office spaces - to explore the aesthetic sensibilities of their employees and unleash the inherently creative power of their employees' <b>collective</b> and individual <b>unconscious.</b> Drawing on psychoanalytical theory and experiences of conducting research in creative industries, an alternative perspective is offered which calls into question precisely what is being 'unleashed' during these processes of creativity; suggesting a distorted view of artistic endeavour and an elision of the centrality of skill, ability and craft expertise: the central platforms enabling aesthetic expression in artistic performance...|$|R
30|$|The {{events of}} 9 / 11, it seems, have accentuated this {{suspicion}} {{in the eyes}} of many Hindus and Sikhs, both residing in India and in the larger diaspora; indeed, the Hindu Right led by the BJP capitalized on the convergence of the threat of Islamism to external security and the internal threat to the purity of India (Appadurai 2006 : 105 - 110). Thus, religious and cultural imaginaries when they begin their work at <b>collective</b> conscious and <b>unconscious</b> levels become rather complex processes. The Muslims setting fire in February 2002 near Godhra to the train in which Hindus were returning from their pilgrimage to the reclaimed site of Ramjanmabhoomi in Ayodhya (where once stood the Muslim mosque built by Babar claimed by the Hindus to be standing over the birthplace of Rama), brought home this sad truth.|$|R
40|$|The Sweetness Barrier is a {{collection}} of eight short stories representative of the impact the food industry has had on North America. Unlike other popular Canadian food writing, which focuses on the jovial and humorous aspects of food culture, this collection details the ways in which we, consumers and producers of food, have been eating, growing, buying, and distributing irresponsibly. While food may aid in emotional, mental and physical recovery, this thesis highlights the ways it also wreaks havoc, ravishes and destroys us. The convictions behind this work originate in Samuel de Champlain 2 ̆ 7 s Order of Good Cheer and in the idea that we are healed when we eat and celebrate together, and are explored further by illustrating how Western society has become increasingly atomized as consequence of our <b>collective,</b> albeit perhaps <b>unconscious,</b> refusal to eat together at the dinner table...|$|R
