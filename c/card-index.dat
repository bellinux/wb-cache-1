2500|$|Once Hitler was {{appointed}} Chancellor by German President Paul von Hindenburg, he quickly made efforts {{to manipulate the}} aging president. On 28 February 1933, Hitler convinced Hindenburg to declare {{a state of emergency}} which suspended all civil liberties throughout Germany, due at least in part to the Reichstag fire the night before. Hitler assured Hindenburg throughout that he was attempting to stabilize the tumultuous political scene in Germany by taking a [...] "defensive measure against Communist acts of violence endangering the state." [...] Wasting no time, Himmler set the SD in motion as they began creating an extensive <b>card-index</b> of the Nazi regime's political opponents, arresting labor organizers, socialists, Jewish leaders, journalists, and communists in the process, sending them to the newly-established prison facility near Munich, Dachau. Himmler's SS and SD made their presence felt at once by helping rid the regime of its known political enemies and its perceived ones, as well. As far as Heydrich and Himmler were concerned, the SD left their mission somewhat vaguely defined so as to [...] "remain an instrument for all eventualities". One such eventuality would soon arise.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Clacton's {{attitude}} was more philosophical and better supported by statistics. He {{came into the}} room after Mrs. Seal's outburst and pointed out, with historical illustrations, that such reverses had happened in every political campaign of any importance. If anything, his spirits were improved by the disaster. The enemy, he said, had taken the offensive; and it was now up to the Society to outwit the enemy. He gave Mary to understand that he had taken the measure of their cunning, and had already bent his mind to the task which, so far as she could make out, depended solely upon him. It depended, so she came to think, when invited into his room for a private conference, upon a systematic revision of the <b>card-index,</b> upon the issue of certain new lemon-colored leaflets, in which the facts were marshaled once more in a very striking way, and upon a large scale map of England dotted with little pins tufted with differently colored plumes of hair according to their geographical position. Each district, under the new system, had its flag, its bottle of ink, its sheaf of documents tabulated and filed for reference in a drawer, so that by looking under M or S, as the case might be, you had all the facts with respect to the Suffrage organizations of that county at your fingers' ends. This would require a great deal of work, of course.|$|E

40|$|The new {{computer-based}} registration system, {{a project}} of the National Museum of Geology and Mineralogy in the Netherlands, will considerably increase the accessibility of the Museum collection. This greater access is realized by computerisation of the data in great detail, so that an almost unlimited number of operations to select and sort the data is possible. A flexible design of annotating information, mainly in plain words, saves considerable time. The fast mechanical data processing permits the efficient preparation of catalogues which contain selected information about the geological collection; as an additional benefit labels may be produced at low costs. The RGM system disposes {{of the burden of}} classical registration books and <b>card-indexes,</b> without any essential quality being lost. It combines a minimum of man-hours with an optimal flexibility in storage and retrieval of data, and an acceptable employment of computer time and equipment. The system may also serve for the registration of collections of other institutions, in geology as well as zoology and botany...|$|R
6000|$|Mary {{shut the}} door, laid the {{documents}} upon her table, and sank {{her head on}} her hands. Her brain was curiously empty of any thought. She listened, as if, perhaps, by listening she would become merged again in {{the atmosphere of the}} office. From the next room came the rapid spasmodic sounds of Mrs. Seal's erratic typewriting; she, doubtless, was already hard at work helping the people of England, as Mr. Clacton put it, to think rightly; [...] "generating and stimulating," [...] those were his words. She was striking a blow against the enemy, no doubt, who didn't let the grass grow beneath their feet. Mr. Clacton's words repeated themselves accurately in her brain. She pushed the papers wearily over to the farther side of the table. It was no use, though; something or other had happened to her brain--a change of focus so that near things were indistinct again. The same thing had happened to her once before, she remembered, after she had met Ralph in the gardens of Lincoln's Inn Fields; she had spent the whole of a committee meeting in thinking about sparrows and colors, until, almost {{at the end of the}} meeting, her old convictions had all come back to her. But they had only come back, she thought with scorn at her feebleness, because she wanted to use them to fight against Ralph. They weren't, rightly speaking, convictions at all. She could not see the world divided into separate compartments of good people and bad people, any more than she could believe so implicitly in the rightness of her own thought as to wish to bring the population of the British Isles into agreement with it. She looked at the lemon-colored leaflet, and thought almost enviously of the faith which could find comfort in the issue of such documents; for herself she would be content to remain silent for ever if a share of personal happiness were granted her. She read Mr. Clacton's statement with a curious division of judgment, noting its weak and pompous verbosity on the one hand, and, at the same time, feeling that faith, faith in an illusion, perhaps, but, at any rate, faith in something, was of all gifts the most to be envied. An illusion it was, no doubt. She looked curiously round her at the furniture of the office, at the machinery in which she had taken so much pride, and marveled to think that once the copying-presses, the <b>card-index,</b> the files of documents, had all been shrouded, wrapped in some mist which gave them a unity and a general dignity and purpose independently of their separate significance. The ugly cumbersomeness of the furniture alone impressed her now. Her attitude had become very lax and despondent when the typewriter stopped in the next room. Mary immediately drew up to the table, laid hands on an unopened envelope, and adopted an expression which might hide her state of mind from Mrs. Seal. Some instinct of decency required that she should not allow Mrs. Seal to see her face. Shading her eyes with her fingers, she watched Mrs. Seal pull out one drawer after another in her search for some envelope or leaflet. She was tempted to drop her fingers and exclaim: ...|$|E

Il'Enkov maintained that the information in the Russian Military Archives alphabetical <b>card-indexes</b> [...] "is a priceless treasure of history, which can assist in resolving the problems of the price of Soviet victory" [...] Il'Enkov maintained it could provide an accurate accounting of war losses. Il'Enkov concluded by stating [...] "We established the number of irreplaceable losses of our Armed Forces at the time of the Great Patriotic War of about 13,850,000. A more recent compilation made in March 2008 of the individuals listed in the card files put total dead and missing at 14,241,000 (13,271,269 enlisted men and 970,000 officers) This database does not include all men killed in the war; graves registration teams continue to identify war dead who are not currently included.|$|R

50|$|Walcott's {{methodology}} was patently at fault. Having {{created a}} <b>card-index</b> of biographical material for individual M.P.s, he attempted {{on this basis}} to allot them to the different political groups of his own theory. One connection, the 'Newcastle-Pelham-Walpole' faction, clearly had no existence at all, as any acquaintance with known political correspondence would reveal. Other groups were inflated by the inclusion of men whose relationship with the leading political figure was of the flimsiest nature. Walcott had relied to an extreme degree on a specialized professional technique, and his work ignored not only {{the literature of the}} time but the great mass of political papers which were already available when he wrote.|$|E
5000|$|In November 1977, the Anti-Nazi League was {{established}} by various left and far-left groups to counter {{the impact of the}} Front and related far-right organisations in Britain. In the following years, Rock Against Racism was also created to counter the NF's growth; in 1978 it held two well attended music festivals in London, where bands like The Clash and Steel Pulse performed.Far left activists demonstrated outside NF meetings and encouraged landlords not to allow the NF to use their premises. Many anti-fascists and leftists seeking to obstruct the NF were basing their strategy on a quote attributed to Hitler: [...] "Only one thing could have stopped our movement - if our adversaries had understood its principle and from the first day smashed with the utmost brutality the nucleus of our new movement." [...] In several instances, NF members were physically attacked by their opponents. During the 1970s, the NF created a <b>card-index</b> and photo file of its opponents, which included names and addresses.|$|E
50|$|In {{the very}} first {{sentences}} of his preface, Alexandre Dumas indicated as his source Mémoires de Monsieur d'Artagnan (1700), a historical novel by Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras, which Dumas discovered during his research for his history of Louis XIV, printed by Pierre Rouge in Amsterdam. It was in this book, he said, that d'Artagnan relates {{his first visit to}} M. de Tréville, captain of the Musketeers, where in the antechamber, he met three young Béarnese with the names Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. This information struck the imagination of Dumas so much—he tells us—that he continued his investigation and finally encountered once more the names of the three musketeers in a manuscript with the title Mémoire de M. le comte de la Fère, etc.. Excited, Dumas requested permission to reprint the manuscript-a permission which was granted:Now, this is {{the first part of this}} precious manuscript which we offer to our readers, restoring it to the title which belongs to it, and entering into an engagement that if (of which we have no doubt) this first part should obtain the success it merits, we will publish the second immediately.In the meanwhile, since godfathers are second fathers, as it were, we beg the reader to lay to our account, and not to that of the Comte de la Fère, the pleasure or the ennui he may experience.This being understood, let us proceed with our story.The book he referred to was Mémoires de M. d'Artagnan, capitaine lieutenant de la première compagnie des Mousquetaires du Roi (Memoirs of Sir d'Artagnan, Lieutenant Captain of the first company of the King's Musketeers) by Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras (Cologne, 1700). The book was borrowed from the Marseille public library, and the <b>card-index</b> remains to this day; Dumas kept the book when he went back to Paris.|$|E
5000|$|For Herbert Marcuse [...] "The idea of libidinal work {{relations}} in a developed industrial society finds little {{support in the}} tradition of thought, and where suchsupport is forthcoming it seems of a dangerous nature. The transformation of labor into pleasure is the central idea in Fourier's giantsocialist utopia." [...] Fourier insists that this transformation requires a complete change in the social institutions: distribution of the social product according to need, assignment of functions according to individual faculties and inclinations, constant mutation of functions, short work periods, and so on. But the possibility of [...] "attractive labor" [...] (travail attrayant) derives above all from the release of libidinal forces [...] Fourier assumes the existence of an attraction industrielle which makes for pleasurable co-operation. It is based on the attraction passionnée in the nature of man , which persists despite the opposition of reason, duty, prejudice. This attraction passionnée tends toward three principal objectives: the creation of [...] "luxury, or the pleasure of the five senses"; the formation of libidinal groups (of friendship and love); and the establishment of a harmonious order, organizing these groups for work in accordance with the development of the individual [...] "passions" [...] (internal and external [...] "play" [...] of faculties). He believed that there were twelve common passions which resulted in 810 types of character, so the ideal phalanx would have exactly 1620 people. One day there would be six million of these, loosely ruled by a world [...] "omniarch," [...] or (later) a World Congress of Phalanxes. He had a concern for the sexually rejected; jilted suitors would be led away by a corps of fairies who would soon cure them of their lovesickness, and visitors could consult the <b>card-index</b> of personality types for suitable partners for casual sex. He also defended homosexuality as a personal preference for some people. Anarchist Hakim Bey describes Fourier's ideas as follows: [...] "In Fourier's system of Harmony all creative activity including industry, craft, agriculture, etc. will arise from liberated passion — this is the famous theory of [...] "attractive labor." [...] Fourier sexualizes work itself — the life of the Phalanstery is a continual orgy of intense feeling, intellection, & activity, a society of lovers & wild enthusiasts." ...|$|E

40|$|At {{the height}} of the Second World War the Institute of Archaeology hosted a conference in London to map out the post-war future for archaeology. Over a bank-holiday weekend in August 1943 several hundred archaeologists – amateurs, professionals, academics, civil {{servants}} and refugees – debated the future of archaeology. The discussion ranged across fields as diverse as the British Schools of Archaeology abroad, Islamic urban archaeology, licences for excavators, and the need for a national <b>card-index</b> of archaeological sites. Two themes loomed over the event: the question of state funding and control of archaeology caused considerable controversy; whereas the need for greater public engagement and education in archaeology enjoyed near-universal approval.

40|$|Despite the {{possibilities}} of using secondary analysis in social science there are reservations about methodological and ethic issues. Furthermore, the method is under-utilised in Germany {{due to the lack}} of readiness and access to the primary data. In our opinion, the lack of methodological experiences dominates scepticism. Using an interview from a panel-study about young adults entering the job market, we show in our contribution the opportunities, constraints and circumstances involved in secondary analysis. When carrying out secondary analysis, usually the demand for data is restricted to original data from the primary study. However, based on our experience, codes and category schemes used in the computer-assisted qualitative data analysis (CAQDAS) of the primary study are also adequate for performing secondary analysis. Under certain conditions inductive analysis is possible even when relying on theoretical concepts like typologies used in the primary study. If such schemes have the heuristic function of an "oversized <b>card-index</b> box" with broad and not apriori theoretically deduced categories, their applicability for secondary analysis should not contradict open-ended coding in the process of creating in-vivo-codes.

40|$|Charles Davies Sherborn was geologist, indexer and {{bibliographer}} extraordinaire. He {{was fascinated}} by science {{from an early age}} and like so many Victorians, the young Sherborn was a passionate natural history collector and was obsessed with expanding his collection of land and freshwater shells. He later described himself as being a 'thorough magpie' and having 'a <b>card-index</b> mind', and these two traits coalesced in his monumental Index Animalium, the compilation of which occupied 43 years of his life. One of the first visitors through the doors of the Natural History Museum in South Kensington when it opened in 1881, Sherborn began work there seven years later as one of the small band of unofficial scientific workers, paid by the number of fossils he prepared.

40|$|Background. The {{presentation}} of autologous blood donation with analysis of used {{blood and the}} percentage of autologous blood on Orthopedic Department in the years 1996 – 2000. Methods. From <b>card-index</b> of autologous blood donors we analysed 363 preoperative autologous blood donations. We followed the number of doses in one patient and type of operating procedure. We analysed the usage of blood from transfusion issue protocols and the usage of postoperative autotransfusion from patient protocols. Results. 91 % of all preoperative blood donations in our hospital in five years period were from Orthopedic Department. There were 280 operating procedures (hip and knee arthroplasty) that needed blood transfusion. 196 of these (70 %) were included in preoperative blood donation programme. We collected 330 doses: 1 dose in 61 cases, 2 doses in 100, 3 doses in 34 and 4 doses in 1 case or 1. 68 doses per patient. The relationship between used autologous and allogenic blood were 46 : 54 (doses) or 38 : 62 (mL). Autologous blood represented 38 % of all used blood on Orthopedic Department, only 11 % of autologous blood were discarded. Conclusions. The program of preoperative blood donation is well organized on The Orthopedic Department of our Hospital. To our experience we make the most of profit of autotransfusion (to avoid risks of allogenic blood, optimal patient colaboration, low percentage of discarded blood) with two predonated doses in combination with postoperative autotransfusion. Regard to The Law of Blood supply (may 2000) we are going to introduce this protocol of preoperative blood donation for all programed operating procedures in our Hospital, which need blood transfusion. </p...|$|E
