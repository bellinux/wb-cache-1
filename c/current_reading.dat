If this voltage is significant it can be reduced (also reducing the inherent accuracy and precision of the measurement) by using a higher current range.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Turkeltaub et al., reported: [...] "The {{complexities}} of pediatric brain imaging have precluded studies that trace the neural development of cognitive skills acquired during childhood. Using {{a task that}} isolates reading-related brain activity and minimizes confounding performance effects, we carried out a cross-sectional {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) study using subjects whose ages ranged from 6 to 22 years. We found that learning to read is associated with two patterns of change in brain activity: increased activity in left-hemisphere middle temporal and Inferior frontal gyrus and decreased activity in right inferotemporal cortica areas. Activity in the left-posterior superior temporal sulcus of the youngest readers was associated with the maturation of their phonological processing abilities. These findings inform <b>current</b> <b>reading</b> models and provide strong support for Orton's 1925 theory of reading development." ...|$|E

50|$|Application {{developers}} {{writing in}} 6301 assembler {{struggled with the}} small amount of RAM (2 kB) and the lack of an operating system. Another difficulty for developers was with the performance limitations of the earliest DATAPAKs, which used a serial-access internal architecture, as opposed to random access. Retrieving, for example, byte 2000 from a DATAPAK meant issuing successive hardware commands to either step from the <b>current</b> <b>read</b> position one address place at time until position 2000 was reached or, in the worst case, resetting the read position to zero and then issuing a step-forward command 2000 times.|$|R

They could attribute all the suspicious losses of the autumn to the capabilities of British Huff-Duff. Dönitz received additional reassurance in December from a coded letter from a U-570 POW reporting proper destruction of all secret material.|$|E

40|$|Motivation: Current DNA {{sequencing}} technology produces reads of about 500 - 750 base pairs (bp) with typical coverage under 10 X. New sequencing technologies are emerging that produce shorter reads (length 80 - 200 bp) but allow one to generate significantly higher coverage (30 X and higher) at low cost.

Results: We analyze the limitations of assembling reads generated by these new technologies, and present a routine for basecalling in reads prior to their assembly.
