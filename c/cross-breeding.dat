For example, considerable hybridization has occurred between the olive baboon and the hamadryas baboon in Ethiopia. <b>Cross-breeding</b> with the yellow baboon and the Guinea baboon has also been observed.

40|$|Heme oxygenase (HO) is the {{rate-limiting enzyme}} in the heme catabolic pathway and highly {{expressed}} in the placenta.

The aim {{of this study was to}} identify if a deficiency in HO- 1 affects placental development using a mouse model. When HO- 1 heterozygote (Het, HO- 1 +/−) mice were cross-bred, an extremely low birth rate in homozygote (Mut, HO- 1 −/−) offspring (2. 4 %) and small litter sizes were observed. Placentas and fetuses from Het <b>cross-breedings</b> were relatively smaller and weighed less than those from wild-type (WT) <b>cross-breedings</b> at E 12. 5 and E 15. 5. Furthermore, Het placentas had significantly less HO- 1 mRNA and protein levels than WT placentas, but no significant differences in placental HO activity. Interestingly, HO- 2, the constitutive HO isoform, as well as iNOS and eNOS expression were significantly upregulated in Het placentas. Histological examination showed that the junctional zone (JZ) of Het placentas were markedly thinner than those of WT placentas and appeared to be due to an increase in apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed that HO- 1 -expressing cells were located primarily in the JZ of Het placentas, specifically in the spongiotrophoblast layer. In addition, diastolic blood pressures and plasma soluble VEGFR- 1 (sFlt- 1) levels were significantly elevated in pregnant Het mice. We conclude that a partial deficiency in HO- 1 is associated with morphological changes in the placenta and elevations in maternal diastolic blood pressure and plasma sFlt- 1 levels, despite a compensatory increase in HO- 2 expression. 1...|$|R

The morphological analysis, including quantitative (plastic and meristic) and nonmetric features differing in the roach, the silver bream and the common bream, revealed that roach * common bream and roach * silver bream hybrids were easier to distinguish from their parents than silver bream * common bream hybrids. These roach hybrids had many morphological similarities such as the upper iris coloured in red as in the roach, and they were morphologically intermediate to the two parents. This contrasted with the silver bream * common bream hybrids, in which intermediate characteristics were also observed, but with some parental variants. Roach * silver bream hybrids were distinguishable from roach * common bream hybrids by its large eye, its lower scale numbers along the lateral line and its two rows of pharyngeal teeth.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the selective melanocyte destruction in hair bulbs of the murine model for vitiligo (VIT) is instigated by either the local cutaneous environment or an innate melanocyte defect. To address this problem, the authors have isolated the melanocyte population from environmental influences by using cell culture technology and have observed reduced proliferation, specific cytologic abnormalities, and premature cell death in cultures of pure VIT melanocytes established from neonatal skin. Cultured VIT melanocytes manifest abnormal compartmentalization of melanosomes and some aberrant dihydroxyphenylalanine-positive structures. The most prominent abnormality observed in cultured VIT melanocytes {{when compared with the}} control C 57 BL/ 6 J cells is a development in dilation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) that morphologically resembles the in vivo condition. Dilation of the RER can be exaggerated in VIT or induced in C 57 BL/ 6 J melanocytes by the addition of Brefeldin A to cultures. Conversely the dilated RER cisternae characteristic of the VIT melanocyte can be reversed by inhibition of protein synthesis with cyclobeximide. Melanocyte cultures developed from heterozygote neonates, resulting from <b>cross-breedings</b> between the VIT and the C 57 BL/ 6 J lines, also demonstrated extensive RER dilation along with only slightly reduced proliferation.

5|$|There is a migratory {{divide in}} Europe at {{longitude}} 10–11°E.

Climate change appears to be affecting the migration pattern of the garden warbler and blackcap. Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps and juvenile (but not adult) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s. Birds of both species are longer-winged and lighter than in the past, suggesting a longer migration as the breeding range expands northwards.|$|E
40|$|The sodium {{phosphate}} co-transporters Npt 2 a and Npt 2 c play {{important roles in}} the regulation of phosphate homeostasis. Slc 34 a 1, the gene encoding Npt 2 a, resides downstream of the gene encoding coagulation factor XII (f 12) and was inadvertently modified while generating f 12 −/− mice. In this report, the renal consequences of this modification are described. The combined single allelic mutant Slc 34 a 1 m contains two point mutations in exon 13 : A 499 V is located in intracellular loop 5, and V 528 M is located in transmembrane domain 11. In addition to the expected coagulopathy of the f 12 −/− phenotype, mice homozygous for the double allelic modification (f 12 −/−/slc 34 a 1 m/m) displayed hypophosphatemia, hypercalcemia, elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase, urolithiasis, and hydronephrosis. Strategic <b>cross-breedings</b> demonstrated that the kidney-related pathology was associated only with autosomal recessive transmission of the slc 34 a 1 m gene and was not influenced by the simultaneous inactivation of f 12. Npt 2 a[V 528 M] could be properly expressed in opossum kidney cells, but Npt 2 a[A 499 V] could not. These results suggest that a single amino acid substitution in Npt 2 a can lead to improper translocation of the protein to the cell membrane, disturbance of phosphate homeostasis, and renal calcification.

Upon returning from exile, and now in Jaén, where he left a large part of his work to the Jaén Documentary Archive of Themes and Authors of the Delegation. In his work he emphasized fundamentally two narrative trilogies and various novels that integrate a lengthy narrative mosaic of the Spanish 20th century, that the author entitled Lares and Penates. He began with a first novel, Fractured Crystal (1945), and followed with two trilogies: Eves and Histories of a History, that narrate, respectively, the occurrences prior to the Civil War through internal histories, and the war itself. His trilogy The Days Before tells of the prewar civil environment through three novels set in the country, the mines, and the sea. It opens with The Plain (1947), the story of a family entrenched in La Mancha, in fact in a pueblo, “Las Encinas”, likely an imitation of the Spanish municipality Viso del Marqués. The mother, Gabriela, defends the family after the father is murdered by the local overlords, until her youngest son relieves her. When the situation seems to improve, the assassin of the mayor makes Benito abandon Las Encinas. The alternation of paragraphs between first and third person enlivens the story and its slow tempo confers a notable lyricism. That same Manchegan setting appears again in the stories grouped under the title, Of the Fertile Plain and the Pueblo. The trilogy continues with The Conquered (1949), about the world of the miners, and finishes with The Destiny of Lazarus (1959), centered on the sea. Another of his trilogies was Histories of a History (1973, censured version, and 1986, complete version). He completed the novelistic cycle of Andújar with the novels The Voice and the Blood (1984) and Appointment of Ghosts (1984). Among his most relevant essays one may count Catalan Literature in Exile and Andalusia and Hispanoamerica: Crucible of <b>Cross-Breedings.</b> Among the stories and chronicle-tales we can cite Empty Spaces (1971), The Luminous Strip (1973), Secret Predictions, Parting With Anguish (1944) and Saint-Cyprien, Plague.
