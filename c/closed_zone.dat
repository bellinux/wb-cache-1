Many of the town's essential workers were Palestinians. The military administrators did satisfy some of their needs, such as building a school, supplying medical aid, allocating them 50 dunams for growing vegetables, and renovating the interior of the Dahmash mosque, but it appears the refugees felt like prisoners; Palestinian train workers, for example, were subject to a curfew from evening until morning, with periodic searches to make sure they had no guns. One wrote an open letter in March 1949 to the Al Youm newspaper on behalf of 460 Muslim and Christian train workers: [...] "Since the occupation, we continued to work and our salaries have still not been paid to this day.

The {{mass loss rate}} is obtained self consistently as a solution of the MHD equations, subject to a finite thermal pressure at the stellar surface.

We compute the angular momentum and energy losses as a function of σ and compare them with the analytic expectation from the classical theory of pulsar winds. We observe the convergence to the force-free limit in the energy loss and we study the evolution of the <b>closed</b> <b>zone</b> for increasing magnetization.

40|$|In {{the paper}} {{proposed}} are some simple modifications of plane-parallel and unstable telescopic resonators {{the most widely}} used in excimer lasers. These can increase output energy, density of emission power and improve the shape of a laser beam cross-section. Physical essence of these modifications lies in formation of an optically <b>closed</b> <b>zone</b> in some part of the resonator, which prevents photons to escape. This yields in their increased concentration (the so-called `photon concentrator') that favors discharge stabilization and shifting this zone towards a cathode where main instabilities of an electric discharge originate. In the plane-parallel cavity such a photon concentrator can be realized by application of an output window with a mirror area in the range corresponding to the cathode space. Using the scheme in our conditions we observed the increase of laser pulses emission energy by 15 % and, respectively, their energy density by 44 % with simultaneous decreasing the laser beam shape extent (in its cross-section) and proportional reducing a beam divergency along the diminished size. In the unstable telescopic resonator this kind of a <b>closed</b> <b>zone</b> (photon concentrator) should exist by definition and, as a rule, in a paraxial part of it. The modification proposed consists in shifting this zone towards a cathode. In our conditions this way provided the increase of laser pulse emission energy by 5 % with simultaneous improvement of the laser beam shape (in its cross-section). It means shifting a shaded spot towards a border of the beam cross-section and, in such way, to its practical removal out of operating beam...|$|E

40|$|Accreting pulsars power {{relativistic}} jets, {{and display}} a complex spin phenomenology. These behaviours may be {{closely related to}} the large-scale configuration of the star's magnetic field, shaped by its interaction with the surrounding accretion disc. Here we present the first relativistic simulations of the interaction of a pulsar magnetosphere with an accretion flow. Our axisymmetric simulations treat the magnetospheric, or coronal, regions using a resistive extension of force-free electrodynamics. The magnetic field is also evolved inside the disc, which is a defined volume with a specified velocity field and conductivity profile, found using an alpha-disc model. We study a range of disc alpha-parameters, thicknesses, magnetic Prandtl numbers, and inner truncation radii. We find that a large fraction of the magnetic flux in the pulsar's <b>closed</b> <b>zone</b> is opened by the intrusion of the disc, leading to an enhancement of the power extracted by the pulsar wind and the spin-down torque applied to the pulsar. In our simulations, most of the spin-down contribution to the stellar torque acts on open field lines. The efficiency of field-line opening is high in the simulations' long-term quasi-steady states, which implies that a millisecond pulsar's electromagnetic wind could be strong enough to power the observed neutron-star radio jets, and may significantly affect the pulsar's spin evolution.

40|$|Magnetospheres of pulsars {{are thought}} to be filled with plasma, and {{variations}} in plasma supply can affect both pulsar emission properties and spin-down rates. A number of recently discovered "intermittent" pulsars switch between two distinct states: an "on", radio-loud state, and an "off", radio-quiet state. Spin-down rates in the two states differ by a large factor, ∼ 1. 5 - 2. 5, which is not easily understood in the context of current models. In this Letter we present self-consistent numerical solutions of "on" and "off" states of intermittent pulsar magnetospheres. We model the "on" state as a nearly ideal force-free magnetosphere with abundant magnetospheric plasma supply. The lack of radio emission in the "off" state is associated with plasma supply disruption that results in lower plasma density on the open field lines. We model the "off" state using nearly vacuum conditions on the open field lines and nearly ideal force-free conditions on the closed field lines, where plasma can remain trapped {{even in the absence of}} pair production. The toroidal advection of plasma in the <b>closed</b> <b>zone</b> in the "off" state causes spin-downs that are a factor of ∼ 2 higher than vacuum values, and we naturally obtain a range of spin-down ratios between the "on" and "off" states, ∼ 1. 2 - 2. 9, which corresponds to a likely range of pulsar inclination angles of 30 - 90 ^∘. We consider the implications of our model to a number of poorly understood but possibly related pulsar phenomena, including nulling, timing noise, and rotating radio transients.

40|$|Abstract: Extensor tendon {{injuries}} are very common injuries, which inappropriately treated can cause severe lasting impairment for the patient. Assessment {{and management of}} flexor tendon injuries has been widely reviewed, unlike extensor injuries. It {{is clear from the}} literature that extensor tendon repair should be undertaken immediately but the exact approach depends on the extensor zone. Zone I injuries otherwise known as mallet {{injuries are}} often closed and treated with immobilisaton and conservative management where possible. Zone II injuries are again conservatively managed with splinting. <b>Closed</b> <b>Zone</b> III or ‘boutonniere ’ injuries are managed conservatively unless there is evidence of displaced avulsion fractures {{at the base of the}} middle phalanx, axial and lateral instability of the PIPJ associated with loss of active or passive extension of the joint or failed non-operative treatment. Open zone III injuries are often treated surgically unless splinting enable the tendons to come together. Zone V injuries, are human bites until proven otherwise requires primary tendon repair after irrigation. Zone VI injuries are close to the thin paratendon and thin subcutaneous tissue which strong core type sutures and then splinting should be placed in extension for 4 - 6 weeks. Complete lacerations to zone IV and VII involve surgical primary repair followed by 6 weeks of splinting in extension. Zone VIII require multiple figure of eight sutures to repair the muscle bellies and static immobilisation of the wrist in 45 degrees of extension. To date there is little literature documenting the quality of repairing extensor tendon injuries however loss of flexion due to extensor tendon shortening, loss of flexion and extension resulting from adhesions and weakened grip can occur after surgery.

40|$|Although {{initially}} {{thought to}} be promising for production of the r-process nuclei, standard models of neutrino-heated winds from proto-neutron stars (PNSs) do not reach the requisite neutron-to-seed ratio for production of the lanthanides and actinides. However, the abundance distribution created by the r-, rp-, or ν p-processes in PNS winds depends sensitively on the entropy and dynamical expansion timescale of the flow, which may be strongly affected by high magnetic fields. Here, we present results from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of non-rotating neutrino-heated PNS winds with strong dipole magnetic fields from 10 ^ 14 - 10 ^ 16 G, and assess their role in altering the conditions for nucleosynthesis. The strong field forms a <b>closed</b> <b>zone</b> and helmet streamer configuration at the equator, with episodic dynamical mass ejections in toroidal plasmoids. We find dramatically enhanced entropy in these regions and conditions favorable for third-peak r-process nucleosynthesis if the wind is neutron-rich. If instead the wind is proton-rich, the conditions will affect the abundances from the ν p-process. We quantify the distribution of ejected matter in entropy and dynamical expansion timescale, and the critical magnetic field strength required to affect the entropy. For B≳ 10 ^ 15 G, we find that ≳ 10 ^- 6 M_ and up to ∼ 10 ^- 5 M_ of high entropy material is ejected per highly-magnetized neutron star birth in the wind phase, providing a mechanism for prompt heavy element enrichment of the universe. Former binary companions identified within (magnetar-hosting) supernova remnants, the remnants themselves, and runaway stars may exhibit overabundances. We provide a comparison with a semi-analytic model of plasmoid eruption and discuss implications and extensions. Comment: 14 pages, submitted to MNRA...|$|E
