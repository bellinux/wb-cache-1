50|$|The {{proposal}} of the <b>committee</b> <b>was</b> accepted in 1952 {{by the government}} of newly independent India. Though most of the recommendations of the <b>committee</b> <b>were</b> not implemented at the time, the <b>committee</b> <b>was</b> a trigger to the reforms that followed.|$|R
5|$|As of2014, {{the town}} is served by Police Chief Charles Bockey and Fire Chief Greg Locke, {{both of whom are}} on the town's Public Safety Committee. The town is served by five other committees: the Administrative Committee, the Personnel Committee, the Water and Sewer Committee, the Public Works Committee, and the Finance Committee. The members of those five <b>committees</b> <b>are</b> {{composed}} of Town Council members.|$|E
5|$|<b>Committees</b> <b>are</b> {{designed}} {{to assist the}} Senate as a whole. Thus the main formal structure of their work is that the Senate refers something to a committee for examination, and the committee reports back to the Senate on that matter. These reports are tabled during parliamentary sittings, but can also be presented when the Senate is not in session. Committees can gather evidence and will often hold public hearings to assist this process. To gather their evidence committees can (with exceptions) travel {{from place to place}} to hear evidence. <b>Committees</b> <b>are</b> able to order the production of documents and the appearance of witnesses (powers that are in practice used very sparingly). Most evidence taken by committees (both written submissions and transcripts of public hearings) is published, however committees have the power to take evidence confidentially (in camera), and regularly do so. Committees hold both public hearings and conduct business at private meetings. The minutes of private meetings are confidential (in contrast, for example, to those of New South Wales parliamentary committees).|$|E
5|$|IUPAC {{is governed}} by several {{committees}} that all have different responsibilities. The <b>committees</b> <b>are</b> as follows: Bureau, CHEMRAWN (Chem Research Applied to World Needs) Committee, Committee on Chemistry Education, Committee on Chemistry and Industry, Committee on Printed and Electronic Publications, Evaluation Committee, Executive Committee, Finance Committee, Interdivisional Committee on Terminology, Nomenclature and Symbols, Project Committee, and Pure and Applied Chemistry Editorial Advisory Board.

50|$|All the MCAA <b>Committees</b> <b>were</b> {{developing}} new projects in 1995. The Apprenticeship <b>Committee</b> <b>was</b> {{working on a}} curriculum for a three-year bricklayer training course, the Safety <b>Committee</b> <b>was</b> developing Tool Box Talks and videos, the Legislative Committee had created an MCAA Political Action Committee, a Foreman's course was in the works and being working on by the Education Committee, the Membership <b>Committee</b> <b>was</b> developing a Membership Service Program and Directory, and the Marketing <b>Committee</b> <b>was</b> developing a profile program which would assist all the other efforts in determining their course of action.|$|R

5|$|Subject <b>Committees</b> <b>are</b> {{established}} {{at the beginning of}} each parliamentary session, and again the members on each committee reflect the balance of parties across Parliament. Typically each committee corresponds with one (or more) of the departments (or ministries) of the Scottish Government. The current Subject Committees in the fourth Session are: Economy, Energy and Tourism; Education and Culture; Health and Sport; Justice; Local Government and Regeneration; Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment; Welfare Reform; and Infrastructure and Capital Investment.|$|E
5|$|The Senate's <b>committees</b> <b>are</b> {{formed at}} the {{commencement}} of each new parliament, in accordance with rules {{set out in the}} Standing Orders. The committees exist until {{the first day of the}} following parliament, in contrast to the lower house committees, which cease to exist as soon as parliament is prorogued for an election.|$|E
5|$|The {{committees}} of the Australian Senate are {{committees of}} Senators, {{established by the}} Australian Senate, for purposes determined by that body. Senate <b>committees</b> <b>are</b> part of {{the operation of the}} Australian parliament, and have for some decades been involved in maintenance of government accountability to the Australian parliament, particularly through hearings to scrutinise the budget, and through public inquiries on policy questions.|$|E
50|$|The National <b>Committee</b> <b>is</b> elected {{annually}} by {{delegates to the}} LRC's annual general meeting. Members of the National <b>Committee</b> <b>are</b> elected for 12 month terms to conduct the general business of the LRC between annual general meetings. The National <b>Committee</b> <b>is</b> responsible for electing, and holding to account, an Executive <b>Committee,</b> which <b>is</b> responsible for any general business between meetings of the National Committee. The National <b>Committee</b> <b>is</b> also responsible for the preparation of LRC publications, and for appointing delegates to represent the LRC when necessary.|$|R
50|$|A <b>committee</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} a deliberate attempt to address disparate design, but design by <b>committee</b> <b>is</b> associated with silent design.|$|R

5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{committees}} differ from their national counterparts as, although smaller in comparison {{to those of the}} United States Congress, the European Parliament's <b>committees</b> <b>are</b> unusually large by European standards with between eight and twelve dedicated members of staff and three to four support staff. Considerable administration, archives and research resources are also at the disposal of the whole Parliament when needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{student council}} {{is a group}} of {{students}} which provides a liaison between the teachers and students. Meanwhile, the Disciplinary Committee consists of students who are essentially rule enforcers. The third less notable committee is the Extracurricular Activities Federation who ensures that school clubs don't come into conflict with each other. The three <b>committees</b> <b>are</b> closely related and work together to preserve the peace on campus.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} graduate schools and <b>committees</b> <b>are</b> divided into five divisions: Biological Sciences, Humanities, Physical Sciences, Social Sciences, and the Institute for Molecular Engineering. In the autumn quarter of 2015, the university enrolled 3,588 graduate students: 438 in the Biological Sciences Division, 801 in the Humanities Division, 1,102 in the Physical Sciences Division, 1,165 in the Social Sciences Division, and 52 in the Institute for Molecular Engineering.|$|E
50|$|The {{organizing}} <b>committee</b> <b>was</b> initially presided by Ponce attorney Esteban Rodríguez Maduro {{until it}} was dissolved in 1992. A new <b>Committee</b> <b>was</b> formed in August 1992, presided by Dr. Héctor López Pumarejo. The new <b>Committee</b> <b>was</b> formed just 15 months before the inaugural day of the Games.|$|R
50|$|<b>Committee</b> members <b>were</b> {{appointed}} by the Minister or Parliamentary Secretary responsible for Antarctic matters. The <b>committee</b> <b>was</b> founded in 1952 as the Antarctic Names Committee of Australia and changed to the current name in 1982 to reflect the multiple functions that the <b>committee</b> <b>is</b> responsible for. The <b>committee</b> <b>was</b> replaced by the Australian Antarctic Division Place names Committee in 2015.|$|R
50|$|In 2015 the State Land <b>Committee</b> <b>was</b> reconstituted, and the Land Recovery Unit, a {{complaints}} and standards <b>committee</b> <b>was</b> set up.|$|R
5|$|Committees {{comprise}} {{a small number}} of MSPs, with membership reflecting the balance of parties across Parliament. There are different committees with their functions set out in different ways. Mandatory <b>Committees</b> <b>are</b> committees which are set down under the Scottish Parliament's standing orders, which govern their remits and proceedings. The current Mandatory Committees in the fourth Session of the Scottish Parliament are: Public Audit; Equal Opportunities; European and External Relations; Finance; Public Petitions; Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments; and Delegated Powers and Law Reform.|$|E
5|$|Select <b>committees</b> <b>are</b> {{temporary}} committees, {{established by}} the Senate to deal with particular issues. This may occur when a particular group of Senators wishes to examine an issue in depth, or {{where there is no}} existing committee suited to addressing a particular topic. Australian Senate select committees have included ones set up to examine the Administration of Indigenous Affairs, and Mental Health. Select committees usually cease to exist upon reporting back to the chamber. One exception to this was the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation which in various forms existed for a decade.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} and high profile of the <b>committees</b> <b>are</b> the pairs of standing committees. These each have six members. The chairman of each legislation committee is chosen from amongst the government members, the deputy chair from amongst non-government members. The reverse {{is the case for}} the references committees. Because the chair has a casting vote {{in the event of a}} committee vote being tied, the government effectively controls the legislation committees, while the non-government parties control the references committees.|$|E
50|$|The first Estonian Citizens <b>Committee</b> <b>was</b> {{founded on}} March 21, 1989 in Kadrina; the first county {{to set up}} such a <b>committee</b> <b>was</b> Kuressaare (10 April 1989). The first county <b>committee</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} on May 12, 1989 in Virumaa. Most of the registration effort was undertaken during the summer months.|$|R

5|$|All the {{candidates}} in a GRC must either {{be members of}} the same political party or independent candidates standing as a group, and at least one of {{the candidates}} must be a person belonging to the Malay, Indian or some other minority community. A person is regarded as belonging to the Malay community if, regardless of whether or not he or she is of the Malay race, considers himself or herself to be a member of the community and is generally accepted as such by the community. Similarly, a person will belong to the Indian community or some other minority community if he or she considers himself or herself a member and the community accepts him or her as such. The minority status of candidates is determined by two committees appointed by the President, the Malay Community Committee and the Indian and Other Minority Communities Committee. Decisions of these <b>committees</b> <b>are</b> final and conclusive, and may not be appealed against or called into question in any court.|$|E
5|$|Croatia's county prefects, {{city and}} town mayors are elected to {{four-year}} terms {{by a majority}} of votes cast within applicable local government units, with a runoff election if no candidate achieves a majority {{in the first round of}} voting. Members of county, city and municipal councils are elected to four-year terms through proportional representation, with the entire local government unit as a single constituency. The number of council members is defined by the councils themselves, based on applicable legislation. Electoral <b>committees</b> <b>are</b> tasked with determining whether the national minorities are represented in the council (as required by the constitution), adding further members to the council (who belong to the appropriate minorities) by selecting them from unelected-candidate lists. Election silence, as in all other elections in Croatia, is enforced on the day of the elections and the previous day, ending at 7:00pm when the polling stations close and exit polls may be announced.|$|E
5|$|No one {{familiar}} {{with the history of}} this country can deny that congressional <b>committees</b> <b>are</b> useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.|$|E
