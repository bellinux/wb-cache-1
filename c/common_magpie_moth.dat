40|$|During the {{breeding}} season of 1998, {{the experiment was}} conducted on {{the breeding}} density of <b>Common</b> <b>magpie</b> Pica pica, western jackdaw Corvus monedula and hooded crow Corvus cornix in towns in north-eastern Slovenia. In each town I randomly selected plots. They measured 99 ha in Celje, 65. 5 ha and 52. 3 ha in Maribor, 46. 0 ha in Ptuj, 73. 4 in Slovenska Bistrica, 11. 4 ha in Slovenske Konjice and 96 ha in žalec. The most common species was <b>common</b> <b>magpie</b> which was present in all seven towns and the rarest western jackdaw which bred only in two towns. <b>Common</b> <b>magpie</b> density in Slovenian towns was approximately the same as in other similar towns in Central Europe and smaller than in other bigger towns. Interestingly,densities of <b>common</b> <b>magpie</b> in towns under study are even higher than density in rural areas in Slovenia and elsewhere. The main reasons for higher densities in towns are probably a result of food availability throughout the year, and lack of predators. Relationship between density of <b>common</b> <b>magpie</b> and number of inhabitants in towns was not significant (r= - 0. 30, P> 0. 05, n = 5). Due to lower densities of <b>common</b> <b>magpie</b> in smaller towns I predict that colonization was recent. Based on historic data I predict that Celje was colonized by <b>common</b> <b>magpie</b> about 20 years ago, Maribor some years earlier, whereas colonization of Slovenj Gradec, Slovenska Bistrica and žalec was in recent years. Since densities of hooded crow is lower then <b>common</b> <b>magpie,</b> colonization of this species is probably even later...|$|R
50|$|Nyctemera amicus, the senecio <b>moth</b> or <b>magpie</b> <b>moth,</b> is a moth of {{the family}} Erebidae. It is found in {{south-east}} Asia, Oceania, and most of Australia. It {{can also be found}} in New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|Gooseberry bushes are {{vulnerable}} to <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> (Abraxas grossulariata) caterpillars. In cultivation, the best method for removing them is to remove the larvae by hand soon after they hatch; its eggs are laid on fallen gooseberry leaves.|$|R
40|$|Invasive {{species can}} {{significantly}} impact native food webs through indirect effects. Examples of apparent competition typically involve a non-native consumer disproportionately affecting one host {{population in the}} presence of another. My research finds evidence for apparent competition between two herbs, one invasive and one endemic, and mediated by an endemic insect herbivore. The European pasture herb Jacobaea vulgaris (formerly Senecio jacobaea), is an invasive weed in several parts of the world, including New Zealand. New Zealand is also home to 19 native species of Senecio – thirteen of which are endemic – that support an endemic insect fauna. Some of these insects have since expanded their host range to include the invasive J. vulgaris. I examined the relationships between one of those herbivores, the New Zealand <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> (Nyctemera annulata, Lepidoptera: Arctiidae), J. vulgaris and one endemic (S. wairauensis) and two native host plants (S. minimus and S. quadridentatus). In my laboratory assays, <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> larvae found J. vulgaris as attractive as native host plants and larvae fed only J. vulgaris developed at comparable rates to those fed only native hosts. My landscape surveys revealed a strong association between J. vulgaris infestations, <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> abundance and increased levels of herbivore damage of the endemic S. wairauensis. Likewise, S. wairauensis was more likely to be present in transects where J. vulgaris was rare. There is convincing anecdotal evidence that the native <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> became far more abundant because of an invasive weed and my study suggests that this detrimentally affects native plants through population spillback...|$|R

50|$|Insectivorous, {{the shining}} bronze-cuckoo eats insects that are avoided by other birds, such as caterpillars, {{particularly}} those of the <b>magpie</b> <b>moth,</b> and beetles, particularly ladybirds. The shining bronze cuckoo's gizzard is lined with a soft thick lining which catches the caterpillar spines; these fall away and are spat out by the bird.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} form of Senecio found in New Zealand is the {{introduced}} 'ragwort' (Jacobaea vulgaris) - a weed in most cultivated areas of the country and the <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> can often be seen around cultivated farmlands during the summer months and feed primarily on the leaves and flowers. Other favoured plants include Senecio vulgaris (groundsel) and garden cineraria.|$|R
50|$|The <b>magpie</b> <b>moth’s</b> ‘woolly bear’ {{caterpillars}} {{are around}} 35-38 mm when fully grown and predominantly black with lines of red down its sides and back, blue spots and tufts of hair on each segment. Its liking for the introduced ragwort causes its caterpillars to be sometimes misidentified {{as those of}} the cinnabar moth which was introduced as a biological control for ragwort. By contrast cinnabar caterpillars have smooth bodies with alternating yellow and black rings.|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{food source}} of Nyctemera annulata are plants from the tribe Senecioinae of the Asteraceae. [...] Thirty three species {{are known to}} exist in the wild and New Zealand has 19 native Senecio species with 14 of them naturalised exotics. N. annulata diet is {{specifically}} limited to one specific plant. Even though the <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> is a native, it has been found that they do not restrict themselves to only the native Senecio species in New Zealand and will also feed on exotic introduced species.|$|R
60|$|At {{the same}} meeting Mr. A. G. Butler, of the British Museum, communicated {{the results of}} his {{observations}} with lizards, frogs, and spiders, which strikingly corroborate those of Mr. Weir. Three green lizards (Lacerta viridis) which he kept for several years, were very voracious, eating all kinds of food, from a lemon cheesecake to a spider, and devouring flies, caterpillars, and humble bees; yet there were some caterpillars and moths which they would seize only to drop immediately. Among these the principal were the caterpillar of the <b>Magpie</b> <b>moth</b> (Abraxas grossulariata) and the perfect six spot Burnet moth (Anthrocera filipendulæ). These would be first seized but invariably dropped in disgust, and afterwards left unmolested. Subsequently frogs were kept and fed with caterpillars from the garden, but two of these--that of the before-mentioned <b>Magpie</b> <b>moth,</b> and that of the V. moth (Halia wavaria), which is green with conspicuous white or yellow stripes and black spots--were constantly rejected. When these species were first offered, the frogs sprang at them eagerly and licked them into their mouths; no sooner, however, had they done so than they seemed {{to be aware of the}} mistake that they had made, and sat with gaping mouths, rolling their tongues about until they had got quit of the nauseous morsels.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Weights, {{measurements}} and stomach-contents {{of a sample}} of shining cuckoos (Chrysococcyx lucidus) are summarised. Mean weights and measurements did not differ between the sexes. The diet comprised only insects, mainly caterpillars and beetles. A third of the caterpillars were larvae of the <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> (Nyctemera annulata) whose spines embed in {{the lining of the}} gizzard, and most beetles were ladybirds (Coccinellidae). Thus many prey were insects generally avoided by other birds. Ingested items were mostly less than 16 mm long, and a third were only 1 - 5 mm long...|$|R
50|$|The adult moth has black wings {{with white}} {{markings}} {{on both the}} forewings and hindwings. The forewings have two white spots that are more elongated while the hindwing only has a single spot near to the centre; the wingspan is 35-45 mm. The thorax and abdomen of the moth are black with bands of orange. The <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> is diurnal which, coupled with its colourful markings means it is often mistaken for a butterfly. It is most active from September to June in the mornings and evenings {{where it can be}} seen flying over the tops of host plants.|$|R
50|$|After {{education}} at Leighton Park School and Cambridge University {{he became an}} academic at Cambridge University. He was an early Mendelian geneticist who discovered sex linkage, while writing up {{the results of the}} Reverend G.H. Raynor on the <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> Abraxas grossulariata. He later wrote a number of books on Mendelian genetics and on sex determination. He was appointed assistant to the Superintendent of the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology in June 1902, and himself filled this position from 1909 to 1914. He was elected to the Royal Society of London on the strength of these achievements in 1915. He died of sarcoma in 1920, and William Bateson wrote his obituary in Nature.|$|R
60|$|His next {{experiments}} were with those smooth gaily-coloured caterpillars which never conceal themselves, {{but on the}} contrary appear to court observation. Such {{are those of the}} <b>Magpie</b> <b>moth</b> (Abraxas grossulariata), whose caterpillar is conspicuously white and black spotted--the Diloba coeruleocephala, whose larvæ is pale yellow with a broad blue or green lateral band--the Cucullia verbasci, whose larvæ is greenish white with yellow bands and black spots, and Anthrocera filipendulæ (the six spot Burnet moth), whose caterpillar is yellow with black spots. These were given to the birds at various times, sometimes mixed with other kinds of larvæ which were greedily eaten, but they were in every case rejected apparently unnoticed, and were left to crawl about till they died.|$|R
2500|$|The Eurasian <b>magpie</b> or <b>common</b> <b>magpie</b> (Pica pica) is a {{resident}} breeding bird throughout Europe, much of Asia and the Maghreb. It {{is one of}} several birds in the crow family designated magpies, and belongs to the Holarctic radiation of [...] "monochrome" [...] magpies. In Europe, [...] "magpie" [...] is used by English speakers as a synonym for the European magpie: the only other magpie in Europe is the Iberian magpie (Cyanopica cooki), which is limited to the Iberian peninsula.|$|R
50|$|Abraxas sylvata, the clouded <b>magpie,</b> is a <b>moth</b> of {{the family}} Geometridae that was named by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1763.|$|R
50|$|Other {{potential}} {{threats are}} V-moth (Macaria wauaria) and Gooseberry sawfly (Nematus ribesii). Nematus ribesii grubs will bury {{themselves in the}} ground to pupate; on hatching into adult form, they lay their eggs, which soon hatch into larvae, {{on the underside of}} gooseberry leaves. Insecticides used in the 19th-century against these included tar water, weak solutions of carbolic acid, and powdered hellebore, which worked against <b>magpie</b> <b>moths</b> and V-moths as well as gooseberry sawflies. (Foxglove and tobacco infusions were also sometimes used.) A 2008 study concluded that a solution of magnesium sulfate applied to a bush's leaves has a good residual action on the eggs and larvae of gooseberry sawfly, and also appears to deter egg-laying female sawflies. Careful removal of fallen leaves and tilling of the ground around the plant will also destroy most eggs and chrysalises of these insects.|$|R
50|$|Birds at Sumin Reserve Forest include species {{like the}} kalij pheasant, hill partridge, satyr tragopan, bar-throated minla, black-eared shrike babbler, white-crested laughingthrush, rusty-fronted barwing, crimson-browed finch, <b>common</b> green <b>magpie</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|Three to six {{eggs are}} laid with five being most common. They are {{variable}} in colour with dark markings on a whitish, pinkish or blue-green background. They measure 21.2-24.1 mm by 15.3-17.8 mm. They are incubated by the female for 14-16 days. The young birds fledge after {{about two weeks}} and remain close to the nest for another two weeks. Usually one clutch of eggs is laid in a year but a second clutch is laid if {{the first one is}} destroyed. Strong winds and predation by <b>common</b> <b>magpies</b> result in the loss of many eggs.|$|R
40|$|The enemy release {{hypothesis}} {{predicts that}} native herbivores will either prefer or cause {{more damage to}} native than introduced plant species. We tested this using preference and performance experiments in the laboratory and surveys of leaf damage caused by the <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> Nyctemera amica on a co-occuring native and introduced species of fireweed (Senecio) in eastern Australia. In the laboratory, ovipositing females and feeding larvae preferred the native S. pinnatifolius over the introduced S. madagascariensis. Larvae performed equally well on foliage of S. pinnatifolius and S. madagascariensis: pupal weights did not differ between insects reared on the two species, but growth rates were significantly faster on S. pinnatifolius. In the field, foliage damage was significantly greater on native S. pinnatifolius than introduced S. madagascariensis. These results support the enemy release hypothesis, and suggest that the failure of native consumers to switch to introduced species contributes to their invasive success. Both plant species experienced reduced, rather than increased, levels of herbivory when growing in mixed populations, as opposed to pure stands in the field; thus, {{there was no evidence}} that apparent competition occurred...|$|R
50|$|Species {{of birds}} are found here include: pond heron, black eagle, hill partridge, red-vented bulbul, ashy wood pigeon, bronzed drongo, white-throated fantail, blue rock thrush, scarlet minivet, lesser racket-tailed drongo, rufous sibia, grey treepie, {{spangled}} drongo and <b>common</b> green <b>magpie.</b> Many locals {{are involved in}} tourism-related business.|$|R
60|$|As sexual {{selection}} depends on so fluctuating an element as taste, {{we can understand}} how it is that, within {{the same group of}} birds having nearly the same habits, there should exist white or nearly white, as well as black, or nearly black species,--for instance, both white and black cockatoos, storks, ibises, swans, terns, and petrels. Piebald birds likewise sometimes occur in the same groups together with black and white species; for instance, the black-necked swan, certain terns, and the <b>common</b> <b>magpie.</b> That a strong contrast in colour is agreeable to birds, we may conclude by looking through any large collection, for the sexes often differ from each other in the male having the pale parts of a purer white, and the variously coloured dark parts of still darker tints than the female.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Feathers have {{recently}} {{been shown to be}} potentially useful non-destructive biomonitoring tools for organic pollutants. However, the suitability of feathers to monitor regional variations in contamination has not been investigated until now. Here concentrations of organic pollutants were compared in feathers of <b>common</b> <b>magpies</b> (Pica pica) between urban and rural areas in Flanders, Belgium. The results showed that concentrations of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) were significantly higher in the rural areas (rural: 12140 ng/g feather, urban: 1. 17. 2 ng/g feather), while polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were significantly more available in an urban environment (sum PCBs rural: 2. 922 ng/g feather, urban: 41240 ng/g feather). This pattern agrees with previous studies using other tissues than feathers as a biomonitoring tool. In addition, differences in PCBs and PBDEs profiles were found with lower halogenated congeners being more prominent in the urban areas in comparison to the rural areas. In summary, feathers seem to reflect regional variations in contamination, which strengthens their usefulness as a non-destructive biomonitor for organic pollutants...|$|R
40|$|Insects rely on {{chemical}} {{information obtained}} from their surroundings when locating biologically important resources. Detection of these chemicals is {{mediated by the}} antennae, which are endowed with various sensory structures called sensilla. Sensilla type, distribution and density vary among species, between sexes and at different life stages, and may provide important information regarding the ability of individuals to detect and process such external stimuli. The {{aim of this study}} was to quantitatively investigate the sensory architecture of larval and adult antennae in the New Zealand <b>magpie</b> <b>moth,</b> Nyctemera annulata (Arctiinae). Using scanning electron microscopy the sensilla were identified and classified into 8 types: trichoid, basiconic, chaetic, auricillic, squamiform, styloconic, coeloconic and Böhm's bristles, with multiple subtypes. Larval antennae were found to possess morphology and sensory structures which are essentially ubiquitous across the Lepidoptera. Sexual dimorphism was apparent in the overall antennal morphology as well as in the distribution, density and morphology of particular types of sensilla in adult N. annulata, which likely represents a divergence in sensory functions based on the different resource cues responded to by males (sex pheromones) and females (host plant odours). This is a rare example of a study which quantifies variation in the numbers and dimensions of all antennal sensilla types for males and females to allow a thorough statistical assessment of sexual dimorphism in antennal sensory architecture...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the rainy}} season, bird life is most abundant. The red-wattled lapwing {{can be heard}} with its {{distinctive}} cry which {{has given rise to}} its Thai name [...] "kratae-tae-waed", and Hoopoe, even the occasional kingfisher or egret frequent the water’s edge. Wild fowl comes down from the hill. More <b>common</b> are <b>magpies</b> and turtle doves. Owls and nightjars can be heard in the evenings.|$|R
60|$|The <b>common</b> <b>magpie</b> (Corvus pica, Linn.), as I {{have been}} {{informed}} by the Rev. W. Darwin Fox, used to assemble {{from all parts of}} Delamere Forest, in order to celebrate the “great magpie marriage.” Some years ago these birds abounded in extraordinary numbers, so that a gamekeeper killed in one morning nineteen males, and another killed by a single shot seven birds at roost together. Whilst they were so numerous, they had the habit very early in the spring of assembling at particular spots, where they could be seen in flocks, chattering, sometimes fighting, bustling and flying about the trees. The whole affair was evidently considered by the birds as of the highest importance. Shortly after the meeting they all separated, and were then observed by Mr. Fox and others to be paired for the season. In any district in which a species does not exist in large numbers, great assemblages cannot, of course, be held, and the same species may have different habits in different countries. For instance, I have never met with any account of regular assemblages of black game in Scotland, yet these assemblages are so well known in Germany and Scandinavia that they have special names.|$|R
50|$|The {{catchment}} {{forests are}} habitats for avian {{species such as}} crested bulbul, Chinese bulbul, hwamei, Oriental magpie robin, Chinese francolin, Japanese quail, <b>common</b> kingfisher, European <b>magpie,</b> crested myna and crows.

Common {{woodland}} and parkland birds during the nesting season include great tit, blue tit, long-tailed tit, Eurasian nuthatch, European green woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, golden oriole, nightingale, blackcap, common chaffinch, hooded crow, European <b>magpie,</b> <b>common</b> wood pigeon, feral pigeon, white wagtail and barn swallow.|$|R
50|$|The <b>common</b> green <b>magpie</b> (Cissa chinensis) is {{a member}} of the crow family, roughly about the size of the Eurasian jay or {{slightly}} smaller. It is a vivid green in colour (often fades to turquoise in captivity), slightly lighter on the underside and has a thick black stripe from the bill (through the eyes) to the nape. Compared to the other members of its genus, the white-tipped tail is quite long. This all contrasts vividly with the red fleshy eye rims, bill and legs. The wings are reddish maroon. When dead, the colour of the bird changes into blue (according to H.J. Noltie's Natural History Drawings from the Collection of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles).|$|R
40|$|The {{ecological}} {{interactions between}} the endemic <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> (Nyctemera annulata) and four weedy Senecio spp. (two indigenous spp., S. glomeratus and S. quadridentatus and two adventive spp., S. sylvaticus and S. vulgaris), were examined in relation to insect preference and development, and counterdefences or developmental responses of the:hosts. Larval development, adult fecundity and host preference {{as a result of}} larval food plant conditioning were studied. Potential depredation of the insect on the hosts was determined and their physical defences and responses to defoliation were assessed. Imago ovipositing was not species specific but directly correlated with dry weight and leaf number of host Senecio spp. Under laboratory conditions fifth instar larvae selected the plant species supporting the most successful larval development, independent of larval conditioning. Food plant preference was in the order: Senecio vulgaris> S. glomeratus = S. quadridentatus > S. sylvaticus. Larvae selected S. vulgaris in field conditions before anthesis but this preference decreased at anthesis. Larvae reared on S. vulgaris had the highest pIc efficiency and E. C. I. value, resulting in rapid larval and pupal development, with larger and heavier instars when compared with other Senecio spp. Larvae reared on S. vulgaris always selected this species in petri dishes. However larval development on different specific hosts did not alter the correlation of oviposition with dry weight and leaf number. The order of imago fecundity for larvae raised on three Senecio spp. was: S. glomeratus > S. vulgaris > S. quadridentatus. Fifth instar larvae acquired the major proportion of the larval food and defoliated the four species to ground level under glasshouse conditions. However the expected overcrowding and complete defoliation in nature has not been observed, possibly due to populations being checked by a high juvenile larval mortality. All Senecio spp. were cold-tolerant and established during winter when larvae showed minimal activity. S. glomeratus and S. quadridentatus~ the two indigenous species, responded to defoliation by vegetative regeneration from root stock. S. vulgaris responded by producing mature fruit more rapidly when attacked. N. annulata may influence the altitudinal distribution of S. sylvaticus as this species is more prolific at higher altitudes where the insect is probably univoltine...|$|R
