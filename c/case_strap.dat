60|$|It {{arrived in}} a very strange shape. In front of our camp were two thorn trees, and from between these trees, the rays from the rising sun falling full on him, I saw a curious figure walking towards me in a slow, {{purposeful}} fashion. It {{was that of a}} man of uncertain age, for though the beard and long hair were white, the face was comparatively youthful, save for the wrinkles round the mouth, and the dark eyes were full of life and vigour. Tattered garments, surmounted by a torn kaross or skin rug, hung awkwardly upon his tall, thin frame. On his feet were veld-schoen of untanned hide, on his back a battered tin <b>case</b> was <b>strapped,</b> and in his bony, nervous hand he clasped a long staff made of the black and white wood the natives call unzimbiti, on the top of which was fixed a butterfly net. Behind him were some Kaffirs who carried cases on their heads.|$|R

50|$|Certified {{engineer}} Lothar Schmidt {{began working}} for Sinn Spezialuhren in September 1993. Prior to this, {{he had been}} working since 1981 for International Watch Company (IWC) in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, first as a freelancer, then as an authorised representative. He was responsible for setting up and operating <b>case</b> and <b>strap</b> production, as well as construction and design. Subsequently, {{he was in charge of}} setting up and operating component production. From 1990 up until his retirement, he was also in charge of overseeing the development of production and logistics at the then subsidiary of IWC, A. Lange & Söhne in Glashütte, Saxony, which had been restored following the collapse of the East German government. Under his leadership, Sinn Spezialuhren underwent major change. It split from the private label sector, expanded its model range, and developed its own watch models and innovative technologies. In addition to direct selling, Lothar Schmidt introduced the concept of distributors: selected watchmakers who also sell the watches. Furthermore, the name of the company was changed to Sinn Spezialuhren GmbH. Most of the company’s watches are assembled and regulated in Frankfurt am Main. Over 12,000 watches are currently sold every year.|$|R
50|$|After {{the family}} {{decided to change}} the company's legal form {{and to keep the}} family out of its management, Ferdinand Alexander founded his own {{industrial}} design company, Porsche Design, in Stuttgart, Germany, which was later moved to Zell am See, Austria, where the Porsche family owns an estate called Schüttgut. The first product Porsche Design created was a chronograph wristwatch made by Swiss watchmaker company Orfina. Its design started while F.A. was still working at the Porsche Style bureau. It was launched in 1973 and was different from other chronograph wristwatches, as its case and bracelet were made out of matte black chromed steel. It was intended as accessory for Porsche drivers and sold by the Porsche dealers. It operated the then-new Valjoux 7750 movement, which is today still the most widespread mechanical movement for chronograph wristwatches. As many customers would have liked a normally-coloured watch, a version with bead-blasted stainless steel was issued. Later the movement was changed to the Lemania 5100, which was a simple and rugged movement mainly used for military watches. The Porsche Design Chrono I was made in different versions — color of <b>case</b> and <b>straps,</b> print on dial — for several country's air forces, as well as the NATO alliance.|$|R

60|$|Finding {{nothing at}} Bolosson to {{interest}} me except a fine {{view of the}} volcano Carlema, then in active eruption, I shouldered my electric rifle and with my <b>case</b> of instruments <b>strapped</b> upon my back plunged at once into the wilderness, down the eastern slope. As I descended {{the character of the}} vegetation altered. The pines of the higher altitudes gave place to oaks, these to ash, beech and maple. To these succeeded the tamarack and such trees as affect a moist and marshy habitat; and finally, when for four months I had been steadily descending, I found myself in a primeval flora consisting mainly of giant ferns, some of them as much as twenty surindas in diameter. They grew upon the margins of vast stagnant lakes which I was compelled to navigate by means of rude rafts made from their trunks lashed together with vines.|$|R
50|$|Suspenders, Individual Equipment Belt - The {{individual}} equipment belt suspenders are Y shaped with three adjusting straps, but four points of {{attachment to the}} {{individual equipment}} belt and small arms ammunition <b>cases.</b> The shoulder <b>straps</b> are padded with spacer cloth. Each shoulder strap has a web loop and a non-slip buckle {{on each of the}} straps in the front and one at the back through which the adjusting straps pass. There are rectangular wire loops located between the web loops and the buckles {{on the front of the}} straps. The 1 in wide adjusting straps have side-retaining snap hooks at one end. The back adjusting strap has an inverted V of which each end has a side-retaining snaphook. Each of the adjusting straps has a loop around it made of 1 in elastic material. In 1991, the individual equipment belt suspenders are redesignated LC-2 with no apparent modifications.|$|R
5000|$|A life-or-death game {{designed}} by Kazuya to test if the friendship between three men indebted to Kazuya--Mario, from the Philippines, Chang, from China, and Mitsuyama, from Japan--is a true bond. The three men {{sit in a}} stair <b>case</b> formation, <b>strapped</b> to their seats with seat belts {{which can only be}} released one at a time with a release button, and are not allowed to look behind them. They each wear a helmet with a light on the top. At the start of each round of the game, the current pot is doubled, and of the three men, one [...] "savior" [...] and two [...] "hostages" [...] is decided via the light on their helmets. The savior must release their seat belt after 30 seconds, but before 60, and press a button across the room, otherwise the helmets of the two hostages will crush their heads. They must use the powers of deduction and observation to determine if they are the savior or the hostage--the player {{at the top of the}} staircase is in the best position for this, as he can see the two other players' lights. Halfway through the game, Kazuya reveals that, if the savior fails to rescue the two hostages, he gets double the entire pot of the current round. Kaiji is brought in as an observer to this game, and frequently cheers on the three men and challenges Kazuya's corrupted view of human nature.|$|R
