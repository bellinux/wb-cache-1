40|$|A cross {{sectional}} {{study was conducted}} to analyze a relationship between bogie locations and the ride performance in a monorail car. This study was carried out t* determine exposure levels of whole body vibration in a certain location in a monorail car and related to various condition path of the beam. Human Vibration Meter (HWl) 100 Larson Davis and Whole Body Vibration (WBV) sensor as a device were used to measure at 2 positions within 3 locations inside a monorail car and 3 different paths of beams. The measurement of whole body vibration was done on a consumer monorail in operation and service during off peak hour. The data in the form magnitude collected and recorded by HVM 100 was transferred to the computer using Blaze software. The analysis of graph pattern and the difference of magnitude value for each location inside a car was studied to determine the exposure level of vibration. Data was evaluated and the results show high magnitude vibration for all / three axes x, y, z which are 6. 92 &st, 4. 61 m/s 2, and 3. 9 m/s 2 respectively, The Vibration Calculator was used to calculate the risk of WBV in the daily vibration exposure that a passenger is subjected to comply health and safety requirements. The finding showed there are relations between bogie location and vibration exposure, which resulted over the allowable exposure limit value 1. 15 m/s 2. The individual subjected to frequently vibration exposure would tend to receive higher rate transmission of vibration in the body and will cause health problem. Among the improvements suggested reducing the vibration such as by putting the seat with a <b>cushion,</b> <b>rubber</b> padding on the floor, and installing more hand pole {{at the center of the}} car...|$|E

40|$|Within the BMBF project 'Unround Wheels', the unroundness, the {{mechanical}} properties and the microstructure of several wheel sets {{of different types}} have been analysed. The unroundness of <b>rubber</b> <b>cushioned</b> wheels is mainly influenced by the well-known threefold polygons which remain constant in shape and location during service-caused wear. No changes of {{the mechanical}} and microstructural properties of the tyres of the wheels in circumferencial direction have been found. Single wheels developed a more pronounced unroundness during service compared to <b>rubber</b> <b>cushioned</b> ones. The analyses of the single wheels showed a modification of the microstructure at the positions of several radius minima. It {{has been found that}} this modified structure differs only slightly from the surrounding perlitic matrix and is moreover strongly confined to the regions close to the running surface. This structure can therefore not be detected by the test methods used for quality control according to the UIC requirements. The state of service-caused hardening below the running surface of the tyres and single wheels revealed no relations to the measured unroundnesses. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract: The {{forklift}} truck {{is one of}} important equipments of the modern logistics system. As the {{forklift truck}} is running, the driver seat and steering wheel of {{a certain type of}} fork-lift truck vibrate strongly, virtual prototyping technology and multi-body dynamics are used to make simulation of dynamic performance of fork-lift truck in this paper, and then the test result is compared with time course load that obtained from frame junction with the annex. We should repeatedly modify the simulation model based on test results, which is consistent with the actual results. Based on this model, so we put forward measures for improving design: Firstly, the axis of rotation of oval steering axle is implied; Secondly, the overhead guard is connected with the frame by the <b>rubber</b> <b>cushion</b> blocks at four different locations; Thirdly, the engine is fixed on the frame by the <b>rubber</b> <b>cushion</b> blocks (shock mount) in two different position. The improved simulation and experimental verification are carried out under the same conditions, and the results show that the fundamental frequency of seat of the improved fork-lift truck and vibration energy are lower. The result proves the practical value of this method in the research of the vibration characteristics of complete engineering machine...|$|R
