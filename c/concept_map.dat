5|$|A {{food web}} is the archetypal {{ecological}} network. Plants capture solar energy {{and use it}} to synthesize simple sugars during photosynthesis. As plants grow, they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing herbivores, and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal trophic species to a top consumer is called the food chain. The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web. Food webs are a type of <b>concept</b> <b>map</b> or a heuristic device that is used to illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows.|$|E
500|$|The {{process for}} {{creating}} levels {{was long and}} complicated. [...] It began {{with the creation of}} a general layout of the area to be built by designers. [...] They would pass this <b>concept</b> <b>map</b> to the artists, who added models to it, beginning with the largest objects and ending with small items such as individual pieces of furniture. After everything was put in place by the art team, designers took over again, inserting graphical enhancements, effects, and collision detection code. With a functional level, creatures, items, traps, and triggers were added last, then scripts were written for everything to control behavior. The team found it quite difficult to keep track of changes made to levels, and there were sometimes communication problems between different parts of the team, such as the artists and designers, resulting in inconsistencies between their work. Ray Muzyka, the co-executive producer, wrote, [...] "We learned to make sure all elements of the team are talking to each other and working as a group, rather than as a bunch of individuals!" [...] They did feel they had done a good job automating the level creation process, as levels were rapidly designed. [...] "A designer," [...] wrote Muzyka, [...] "might submit a level description and receive it, art complete, a month later ready for scripting, but missing some key features (almost always a door). We would then have to determine whether the omission was important enough to have the art piece redone, or whether we could simply tweak the design of the level to fit the finished art." ...|$|E
2500|$|Concept mapping: A {{technique}} for visualizing {{the relationships between}} different concepts. A <b>concept</b> <b>map</b> is a diagram showing the relationships between concepts. [...] Concepts are connected with labelled arrows, in a downward-branching hierarchical structure. The relationship between concepts is articulated in linking phrases, e.g., [...] "gives rise to", [...] "results in", [...] "is required by," [...] or [...] "contributes to". Concept mapping serves several purposes. One, which takes place via knowledge elicitation, is to represent the mental models, i.e., the cognitive map of individuals, teams and organizations. Another, which takes place by knowledge capture, is to represent the structure of knowledge gleaned from written documents. The addition of knowledge resources, e.g., diagrams, reports, other concept maps, spreadsheets, etc., to the concept nodes (attached during or after construction) {{has been found to}} significantly improve the level of meaningful learning of the concept mapper. Educators are increasingly realising the utility of such maps and have started using them in classroom.|$|E

Qualitative {{data were analyzed}} to explain quantitative findings. One hundred sixty-one students (74 boys and 87 girls) in eight, seventh grade science classes at a middle school in Southeast Texas completed the entire study. Using prior science performance scores to assure equivalence of student achievement across groups, the researcher assigned the teacher??????s classes {{to one of the}} three experimental groups. The independent variable, group, consisted of three levels: 40 students in a control group, 59 students trained to individually generate <b>concept</b> <b>maps</b> on computers, and 62 students trained to collaboratively generate <b>concept</b> <b>maps</b> on computers. The dependent variables were science concept learning as demonstrated by comprehension test scores, and quality of <b>concept</b> <b>maps</b> created by students in experimental groups as demonstrated by rubric scores. Students in the experimental groups received <b>concept</b> <b>mapping</b> training and used their newly acquired <b>concept</b> <b>mapping</b> skills to individually or collaboratively construct computer-based <b>concept</b> <b>maps</b> during study time. The control group, the individually-generated <b>concept</b> <b>mapping</b> group, and the collaboratively-generated <b>concept</b> <b>mapping</b> group had equivalent learning experiences for 50 minutes during five days, excepting that students in a control group worked independently without <b>concept</b> <b>mapping</b> activities, students in the individual group worked individually to construct <b>concept</b> <b>maps,</b> and students in the collaborative group worked collaboratively to construct <b>concept</b> <b>maps</b> during their study time.

40|$|Abstract. Interoperability and {{integration}} of digital <b>concept</b> <b>mapping</b> tools has not been widely prioritized and supported by software developers. Digital alternatives to paper-based <b>concept</b> <b>mapping</b> (from simple digital whiteboard to dedicated <b>concept</b> <b>mapping</b> software) are increasingly popular among educators, but computer-based <b>concept</b> <b>maps</b> are still difficult to analyze, assess, expand or export to other software platforms. Lack of interoperability and poor integration of <b>concept</b> <b>mapping</b> tools with widely used Learning Management Systems increases workload of teachers, because of poor reusability and automation opportunities. This paper describes conceptual design and implementation of a <b>concept</b> <b>mapping</b> tool that has been integrated into an open-source virtual learning environment IVA. Despite this <b>concept</b> <b>mapping</b> tool has several unique pedagogical features, interoperability with other stand-alone <b>concept</b> <b>mapping</b> tools has been reached. For instance, <b>concept</b> <b>maps</b> can be exported from IVA to CmapTools or other tools that support XTM specification. ...|$|R

Constructivism and {{meaningful}} learning undergird {{the use of}} <b>concept</b> <b>maps.</b> <b>Concept</b> <b>mapping</b> was applied in undergraduate science courses in a small liberal arts college in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Beginning with the first semester, the instructor used <b>concept</b> <b>maps</b> as advance organizers for lectures and handouts, and students created <b>concept</b> <b>maps</b> as culminating events for the course. In subsequent semesters, student individuals and teams also used <b>concept</b> <b>maps</b> as representations of their thinking about sections of the course; ways to view conceptual structure before and after research; and organizers for a student-created web site. While all applications were useful to some degree, the use of small-group <b>concept</b> <b>mapping</b> was found to particularly enhance use of <b>concept</b> <b>mapping</b> as a tool among the class {{as a whole and}} to balance <b>concept</b> <b>mapping</b> with other teaching/learning methods. A student-generated map to organize a class web site linking student research and projects was particularly innovative. While Inspiration software was often used in these applications to generate clear and creative <b>concept</b> <b>maps,</b> the new CmapTools web site should be valuable in furthering integration of instruction and learning and in enhancing collaborative sharing of <b>concept</b> <b>maps</b> among the educational community...|$|R

40|$|Even {{though there}} is a lot of {{research}} both on formative assessment and structural knowledge, the formative assessment of structural knowledge is an absent element in the study process. One tool which could be used successfully by teachers for the mentioned purpose is <b>concept</b> <b>mapping.</b> However, its application for formative assessment is rarely based on a well-planned approach. This paper presents results indicating that <b>concept</b> <b>mapping</b> is a suitable tool for the formative assessment of structural knowledge. It is the first step of the development of an approach for the use of <b>concept</b> <b>mapping</b> in the formative assessment of structural knowledge. This paper is based on a) extensive analysis of available information sources on formative assessment and <b>concept</b> <b>mapping</b> and b) reflection of the author’s personal experience of implementation of formative assessment activities using <b>concept</b> <b>mapping.</b> The goal of the paper is not only to justify usage of <b>concept</b> <b>mapping</b> as a tool for the formative assessment of structural knowledge, but also to encourage teachers to use <b>concept</b> <b>mapping</b> in their practice for formative assessment purposes.
