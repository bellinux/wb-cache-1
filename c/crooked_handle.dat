60|$|I felt in his pockets, {{one after}} another. A few small coins, a thimble, and some thread and big needles, {{a piece of}} pigtail tobacco bitten away at the end, his gully with the <b>crooked</b> <b>handle,</b> a pocket compass, and a tinder box were all that they contained, and I began to despair.|$|E
60|$|The Old Gentleman {{was thin}} and tall and sixty. He was dressed all in black, and wore the old-fashioned kind of glasses that won't stay on your nose. His hair was whiter and thinner {{than it had been}} last year, and he seemed to make more use of his big, knobby cane with the <b>crooked</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then {{he brought}} from the shed the {{contrivance}} {{he had made the}} night before. It was merely a swing seat. He had taken a wide board that was just long enough for both the boy and girl to sit upon, and had bored six holes in it, two holes at each end and two in the middle. Through these holes he had run stout ropes {{in such a way that}} the seat could not turn and the occupants could hold on to the ropes on either side of them. The ropes were all knotted together at the top, where there was a loop that could be hooked upon the <b>crooked</b> <b>handle</b> of the umbrella.|$|E
50|$|The {{handle of}} the bar in a stay can take on {{different}} shapes. The monkey tail has a spiral with over {{one and a half}} turns, but the pig tail only does just over one turn. The cockspur handle curves down narrowly. A bulb or ball handle has a hemispherical end on it. The shepherds <b>crook</b> <b>handle</b> curls around just over 180Â°. Reeded handles have ridges that help the grip.|$|R
5000|$|Handle. The {{handle of}} a cane is {{extremely}} important to the user. Many different styles exist, the most common traditional designs are the Tourist, or <b>crook</b> <b>handle,</b> the Fritz Handle and the Derby Handle. Ergonomically shaped handles have become increasingly common for canes intended for medical use, both increasing {{the comfort of the}} grip for the user (particularly important for users with disabilities which also affect their hands or wrists), and better transmitting the load from the user's hand and arm into the shaft.|$|R
60|$|We {{then again}} began to mount, {{and before we}} had ascended much farther we passed my three countrymen. They were young men, with gray coats and gray trousers, with slouched hats, and without gloves. They had fair faces and fair hair, and swung big sticks in their hands, with <b>crooked</b> <b>handles.</b> They laughed and talked loud, and, when we met them, seemed to be racing with each other; but {{nevertheless}} they were gentlemen. No one who knows by sight what an English gentleman is, could have doubted that; but I did acknowledge to myself {{that they should have}} remembered that the edifice they were treading was a church, and that the silence they were invading was the cherished property of a courteous people.|$|R
60|$|Cap'n Bill {{suspected}} that these remarks were addressed to him, but he couldn't move just then because the seat was across him, {{and a boy}} and girl were sprawling on the seat. As the Magic Umbrella was now as motionless as any ordinary umbrella might be, Button-Bright first released the catch and closed it up, after which he unhooked the <b>crooked</b> <b>handle</b> from the rope and rose to his feet. Trot had managed by this time to stand up, and she pulled the board off from Cap'n Bill. All this time the shrill, excited voice was loudly complaining because the sailor was on his feet, and Trot looked {{to see who was}} making the protest, while Cap'n Bill rolled over and got {{on his hands and knees}} so he could pull his meat leg and his wooden leg into an upright position, which wasn't a very easy thing to do.|$|E
6000|$|For example, Carshot being {{subsequently}} {{engaged in}} serving cretonne and desiring {{to push a}} number of rejected blocks up the counter {{in order to have}} space for measuring, swept them by a powerful and ill-calculated movement of the arm, with a noise like thunder partly on to the floor and partly on {{to the foot of the}} still gloomily preoccupied junior apprentice. And Buggins, whose place it was to shopwalk while Carshot served, shopwalked with quite unparalleled dignity, dangling a new season's sunshade with a <b>crooked</b> <b>handle</b> on one finger. He arrested each customer who came down the shop with a grave and penetrating look. [...] "Showing very 'tractive line new sheason's shun-shade," [...] he would remark, and, after a suitable pause, [...] "'Markable thing, one our 'sistant leg'sy twelve 'undred a year. V'ry 'tractive. Nothing more to-day, mum? No!" [...] And he would then go and hold the door open for them with perfect decorum and with the sunshade dangling elegantly from his left hand....|$|E
60|$|Vesey was the {{youngest}} reporter. He had a thirty-two-inch chest and wore a number fourteen collar; but his bright Scotch plaid suit gave him presence and conferred no obscurity upon his whereabouts. He wore his hat in such a position that people followed him about to see him take it off, convinced {{that it must be}} hung upon a peg driven into the back of his head. He was never without an immense, knotted, hard-wood cane with a German-silver tip on its <b>crooked</b> <b>handle.</b> Vesey was the best photograph hustler in the office. Scott said it was because no living human being could resist the personal triumph it was to hand his picture over to Vesey. Vesey always wrote his own news stories, except the big ones, which were sent to the rewrite men. Add to this fact that among all the inhabitants, temples, and groves of the earth nothing existed that could abash Vesey, and his dim sketch is concluded.|$|E
50|$|As of late 2014, Andrew Crook and {{his firm}} Crook Media were {{employed}} to handle media relations for the Palmer United Party and Clive Palmer. <b>Crook</b> has <b>handled</b> public relations for Palmer effectively full-time since 2013. Andrew Crook is now {{a person of interest}} in Queensland Police Taskforce Maxima investigations. Palmer and the party are not implicated in any way.|$|R
6000|$|The great {{difficulty}} being thus overcome, the work progressed rapidly. A large hard stone served for an anvil, {{and a small}} stone, perforated, with a handle affixed to it, did duty for a hammer. A pair of carpenter's pincers served for tongs, and charcoal, made from the cocoanut and other trees, did duty for coals. In order to obtain planks, the missionary split trees in half with wedges and then the natives thinned them down with adzes extemporised by fitting <b>crooked</b> <b>handles</b> to ordinary hatchets. When a bent or twisted plank was required, having no apparatus for steaming it, he bent a piece of bamboo to the required shape, and sent natives to scour the woods {{in search of a}} suitable crooked tree. Thus planks suited to his purpose were obtained. Instead of fastening the planks to the timbers of the ship with iron nails, large wooden pins, or [...] "trenails," [...] were used, and driven into augur holes, and thus the fabric was held together. Instead of oakum, cocoanut husk was used, and native cloth and dried banana stumps to caulk the seams, and make them watertight. The bark of a certain tree was spun into twine and rope by a rope-machine made for the purpose, and a still more complex machine, namely, a turning-lathe, was constructed for the purpose of turning the block sheaves; while sails were made out of native mats, quilted to give them sufficient strength to resist the wind.|$|R
50|$|Regardless of the {{technique}} employed {{it is important to}} strike railroad spikes with the handle of the maul as close to horizontal as possible. This requires the user to bend over at the waist with every swing. If the user attempts to drive spikes while standing erect the spike will often bend and the maul head will begin to sit <b>crooked</b> on the <b>handle.</b> Shortly thereafter the maul handle will break.|$|R
500|$|Knowing Gatewood's {{reputation}} as one of the army's [...] "Best Apache Men", Crook made him Commandant of the White Mountain Indian Reservation at Fort Apache under Emmet Crawford. [...] Gatewood and <b>Crook</b> disagreed on <b>handling</b> of the reservation and treatment of the Apaches. [...] After a clash with local politicians over grazing rights on reservation land, Crook had Gatewood transferred in 1885 to command Navajo Scouts. [...] That same year Crook resigned from the Army and Philip Sheridan had him replaced by General Nelson Miles in the Geronimo Campaign.|$|R
60|$|He pondered this as {{he walked}} steadily, holding his {{umbrella}} carefully by the wood, just below the <b>crook</b> of the <b>handle,</b> so as to keep the ferule off the ground, and not fray the silk in the middle. And, with his thin, high shoulders stooped, his long legs moving with swift mechanical precision, this passage through the Park, where the sun shone with a clear flame on so much idleness--on so many human evidences of the remorseless battle of Property, raging beyond its ring--was like the flight of some land bird across the sea.|$|R

60|$|Trot wasn't {{very big}} herself, {{but the boy}} was not quite as big as Trot. He was thin, with a rather pale complexion, and his blue eyes were round and earnest. He wore a blouse waist, a short jacket, and knickerbockers. Under his arm he held an old {{umbrella}} that was as tall as he was. Its covering had once been of thick, brown cloth, but the color had faded to a dull drab except in the creases, and Trot thought it looked very old-fashioned and common. The handle, though, was really curious. It was of wood and carved to resemble an elephant's head. The long trunk of the elephant was curved to make a <b>crook</b> for the <b>handle.</b> The eyes of the beast were small red stones, and it had two tiny tusks of ivory.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{there is}} a voice, there is movement. The first {{footstep}} of the new week of toil is heard. A man muffled up in a thick coat, and bearing in his hand what would seem at the first glance to be a shepherd's <b>crook,</b> only its <b>handle</b> is much longer, appears upon the pavement. He touches a number of windows with great quickness as he moves rapidly along. A rattling noise sounds upon each pane. The use of the long handle of his instrument becomes apparent as he proceeds, enabling him {{as it does to}} reach the upper windows of the dwellings whose inmates he has to rouse. Those inmates are the factory girls, who subscribe in districts to engage these heralds of the dawn; and by a strict observance of whose citation they can alone escape the dreaded fine that awaits those who have not arrived {{at the door of the}} factory before the bell ceases to sound.|$|R
6000|$|Subsequently he {{had other}} foxes caught in traps set for hares, but was always able to release them. About one he had the {{following}} story. The dog he had at that time, named Monk, hated foxes as Jack hated adders, and would hunt them savagely whenever he got a chance. One morning Caleb visited a trap he had set in a gap in a hedge and found a fox in it. The fox jumped up, snarling and displaying his teeth, ready to fight for dear life, {{and it was hard}} to restrain Monk from flying at him. So excited was he that only when his master threatened him with his crook did he draw back and, sitting on his haunches, left him to deal with the difficult business in his own way. The difficulty was to open the steel trap without putting himself in the way of a bite from those [...] "tarrable sharp teeth." [...] After a good deal of manoeuvring he managed to set the butt end of his <b>crook</b> on the <b>handle</b> of the gin, and forcing it down until the iron teeth relaxed their grip, the fox pulled his foot out, and darting away along the hedge side vanished into the adjoining copse. Away went Monk after him, in spite of his master's angry commands to him to come back, and fox and dog disappeared almost together among the trees. Sounds of yelping and of crashing through the undergrowth came back fainter and fainter, and then there was silence. Caleb waited at the spot full twenty minutes before the disobedient dog came back, looking very pleased. He had probably succeeded in overtaking and killing his enemy.|$|R
60|$|The {{old girl}} never appears in walking trim, in any {{season of the}} year, without a grey cloth cloak, coarse and much worn but very clean, which is, undoubtedly, the {{identical}} garment rendered so interesting to Mr. Bagnet by having made its way home to Europe from another quarter of the globe in company with Mrs. Bagnet and an umbrella. The latter faithful appendage is also invariably {{a part of the}} old girl's presence out of doors. It is of no colour known in this life and has a corrugated wooden <b>crook</b> for a <b>handle,</b> with a metallic object let into its prow, or beak, resembling a little model of a fanlight over a street door or one of the oval glasses out of a pair of spectacles, which ornamental object has not that tenacious capacity of sticking to its post that might be desired in an article long associated with the British army. The old girl's umbrella is of a flabby habit of waist and seems to be in need of stays--an appearance that is possibly referable to its having served through a series of years at home as a cupboard and on journeys as a carpet bag. She never puts it up, having the greatest reliance on her well-proved cloak with its capacious hood, but generally uses the instrument as a wand with which to point out joints of meat or bunches of greens in marketing or to arrest the attention of tradesmen by a friendly poke. Without her market-basket, which is a sort of wicker well with two flapping lids, she never stirs abroad. Attended by these her trusty companions, therefore, her honest sunburnt face looking cheerily out of a rough straw bonnet, Mrs. Bagnet now arrives, fresh-coloured and bright, in George's Shooting Gallery.|$|R
