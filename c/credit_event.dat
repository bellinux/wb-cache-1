25|$|Credit default swaps {{have also}} faced {{criticism}} that they {{contributed to a}} breakdown in negotiations during the 2009 General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization, because certain bondholders might benefit from the <b>credit</b> <b>event</b> of a GM bankruptcy due to their holding of CDSs.

2500|$|It {{is not the}} {{responsibility}} of the calculation agent {{to determine whether or not}} a <b>credit</b> <b>event</b> has occurred but rather a matter of fact that, pursuant to the terms of typical contracts, must be supported by publicly available information delivered along with a <b>credit</b> <b>event</b> notice. [...] Typical CDS contracts do not provide an internal mechanism for challenging the occurrence or non-occurrence of a <b>credit</b> <b>event</b> and rather leave the matter to the courts if necessary, though actual instances of specific events being disputed are relatively rare.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} nature of default arrival and {{recovery}} implicit in the term structures of sovereign "CDS" spreads. We argue that term structures of spreads reveal not only the arrival rates of <b>credit</b> <b>events,</b> but also the loss rates given <b>credit</b> <b>events.</b> Applying our framework to Mexico, Turkey, and Korea, we show that a single-factor model with following a lognormal process captures most {{of the variation in}} the term structures of spreads. The risk premiums associated with unpredictable variation in are found to be economically significant and co-vary importantly with several economic measures of global event risk, financial market volatility, and macroeconomic policy.

[...] "Thirteen 'major' dealers of credit-default swaps agreed 'unanimously' that the rescue constitutes a <b>credit</b> <b>event</b> triggering payment or delivery of the companies' bonds," [...] according to a memo circulated by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) after the conservatorship announcement.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "credit default swap" [...] (CDS) is {{a credit}} {{derivative}} contract between two counterparties. [...] The buyer makes periodic {{payments to the}} seller, and in return receives a payoff if an underlying financial instrument defaults or experiences a similar <b>credit</b> <b>event.</b> The CDS may refer to a specified loan or bond obligation of a “reference entity”, usually a corporation or government.|$|E
2500|$|CDS confirmations also {{specify the}} credit events {{that will give}} rise to payment {{obligations}} by the protection seller and delivery obligations by the protection buyer. [...] Typical credit events include bankruptcy {{with respect to the}} reference entity and failure to pay with respect to its direct or guaranteed bond or loan debt. [...] CDS written on North American investment grade corporate reference entities, European corporate reference entities and sovereigns generally also include restructuring as a <b>credit</b> <b>event,</b> whereas trades referencing North American high-yield corporate reference entities typically do not.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to measure the effect of {{different}} credit-related events on the option implied volatility of several companies that belong to the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 index list. Measuring the effect of <b>credit</b> <b>events</b> on volatility will augment on the already important body of literature that investigates the volatility-related phenomena; in particular those who research the effect of news on volatility. I find that, over the entire window around the <b>credit</b> <b>events,</b> there was a decrease in the implied volatility but that only the negative events have a statistically significant effect, which reflects the stronger information content of negative <b>credit</b> <b>events</b> researched by previous papers. I also found that this negative effect is mainly due to a strong “reversal” effect in the post-event 10 -day period, where the negative effect is stronger and more statistically significant (particularly for the negative events). Furthermore, during the pre-event period there is not much evidence that supports any type of foresight of the market. My results also suggest that {{there is a difference between}} the behavior of the implied volatility when the events are outlook changes and credit reviews, and when the event is a rating change (downgrade/upgrade).

2500|$|A CDS {{is linked}} to a [...] "reference entity" [...] or [...] "reference obligor", usually a {{corporation}} or government. The reference entity is not {{a party to the}} contract. The buyer makes regular premium payments to the seller, the premium amounts constituting the [...] "spread" [...] charged by the seller to insure against a <b>credit</b> <b>event.</b> If the reference entity defaults, the protection seller pays the buyer the par value of the bond in exchange for physical delivery of the bond, although settlement may also be by cash or auction.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the event}} of default the buyer of the CDS {{receives}} compensation (usually the face value of the loan), and the seller of the CDS takes possession of the defaulted loan. [...] However, anyone can purchase a CDS, even buyers who do not hold the loan instrument and who have no direct insurable interest in the loan (these are called [...] "naked" [...] CDSs). If there are more CDS contracts outstanding than bonds in existence, a protocol exists to hold a <b>credit</b> <b>event</b> auction; the payment received is usually substantially less than the face value of the loan.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, {{standard}} CDS contracts specify {{deliverable obligation}} characteristics that limit {{the range of}} obligations that a protection buyer may deliver upon a <b>credit</b> <b>event.</b> [...] Trading conventions for deliverable obligation characteristics vary for different markets and CDS contract types. [...] Typical limitations include that deliverable debt be a bond or loan, that it have a maximum maturity of 30 years, that it not be subordinated, that it {{not be subject to}} transfer restrictions (other than Rule 144A), that it be of a standard currency and that it not be subject to some contingency before becoming due.|$|E
40|$|A {{model for}} the credit risk of a {{portfolio}} of market driven #nancial contracts (for example swaps) is introduced. The viewpoint of the financial institution who holds this portfolio is taken. The default intensity of a single counterparty is assumed to write as a sum of two parts: An individual component is unknown and modelled as noise, the collective componentisknown and dependent on market variables #like the interest rate#. The influence of the <b>credit</b> <b>events</b> to the market variables is neglected. The advantage of this model is given by the possibility to consider the statistic of the <b>credit</b> <b>events</b> conditioned on a market situation. By taking a functional like the expectation value of this conditional statistic only the market variables remain stochastic. Therefore this model is especially suited for measuring {{the impact of the}} market variables onto the credit risk...|$|R

40|$|The {{channels}} for the cross-border propagation of sovereign {{risk in the}} international sovereign debt market are analysed. Identifying sovereign <b>credit</b> <b>events</b> as extraordinary jumps in CDS spreads, we distinguish between the immediate effects of such events and their longer term spillover effects. To analyse “fast and furious” contagion, we use daily CDS data to conduct event studies around a total of 89 identified <b>credit</b> <b>events</b> in a global country sample. To analyse “slow-burn” spillover effects, we apply a multifactor risk model, distinguishing between global and regional risk factors. We find that “fast and furious” contagion has been primarily a regional phenomenon, whilst “slow-burn” spillover effects can often be global in scope, especially those of the recent European debt crisis. The global risk factors {{are found to be}} driven by investor risk appetites and debt levels, whilst the regional factors depend on economic fundamentals of countries within a region...|$|R
2500|$|The U.S {{federal income}} tax {{treatment}} of CDS is uncertain (Nirenberg [...] and Kopp 1997:1, Peaslee & Nirenberg 2008-07-21:129 and Brandes 2008). [...] Commentators have suggested that, depending on how they are drafted, they are either notional principal contracts or options for tax purposes,(Peaslee & Nirenberg 2008-07-21:129). {{but this is not}} certain. [...] There is a risk of having CDS recharacterized as different types of financial instruments because they resemble put options and credit guarantees. [...] In particular, the degree of risk depends on the type of settlement (physical/cash and binary/FMV) and trigger (default only/any <b>credit</b> <b>event)</b> (Nirenberg & Kopp 1997:8). And, as noted below, the appropriate treatment for Naked CDS may be entirely different.|$|E
2500|$|The law {{relating}} to insolvency, bankruptcy and liquidation is {{regulated by the}} Insolvency Act, 2003 and the Insolvency Rules, 2005 in the British Virgin Islands. [...] The act is broadly based upon the Insolvency Act 1986 of the United Kingdom (without the changes brought into effect by the UK's Enterprise Act 2002), but modified in certain specific regards {{in relation to the}} jurisdiction's role as an offshore centre. [...] The Insolvency Act is [...] "predicated heavily towards the protection of secured creditors' rights". [...] The legislation includes the ISDA model netting laws to facilitate set-off upon a <b>credit</b> <b>event</b> in derivatives transactions. [...] It also contains specific [...] "safe harbour" [...] provisions {{relating to}} vulnerable transactions (principally undervalue transactions, unfair preferences and voidable floating charges) on an insolvency, to protect structured finance transactions.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the credit}} default swap (CDS) market, the {{standard}} contracts typically used between parties to a swap define the action of placing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship to be equivalent to bankruptcy, because {{of the change in}} management control. In CDS parlance, this is termed a <b>credit</b> <b>event,</b> and that triggers the settling of outstanding contracts for the derivatives, which are used to hedge or speculate on the potential risk that a company will default on its bonds. The two GSEs have approximately US$1.5 trillion in bonds outstanding, and since the market in {{credit default swap}}s is not public, there is no central reporting mechanism to verify how many credit default swaps are linked to those bonds. One estimate floated is US$500 billion, and that the entire [...] CDS market has a notional value in the vicinity of US$62 trillion.|$|E

50|$|The <b>events</b> {{triggering}} a <b>credit</b> derivative are defined in a bilateral swap confirmation {{which is a}} transactional document that typically refers to an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreement previously executed between the two swap counterparties.

2500|$|A default {{is often}} {{referred}} to as a [...] "credit event" [...] and includes such events as failure to pay, restructuring and bankruptcy, or even a drop in the borrower's credit rating. CDS contracts on sovereign obligations also usually include as <b>credit</b> <b>events</b> repudiation, moratorium and acceleration. Most CDSs are in the $10–$20million range with maturities between one and 10 years. [...] Five years is the most typical maturity.|$|R
2500|$|A {{new type}} of default swap is the [...] "loan only" [...] credit default swap (LCDS). This is conceptually very similar to a {{standard}} CDS, but unlike [...] "vanilla" [...] CDS, the underlying protection is sold on syndicated secured loans of the Reference Entity rather than the broader category of [...] "Bond or Loan". Also, as of May 22, 2007, for the most widely traded LCDS form, which governs North American single name and index trades, the default settlement method for LCDS shifted to auction settlement rather than physical settlement. [...] The auction method {{is essentially the same}} that has been used in the various ISDA cash settlement auction protocols, but does not require parties to take any additional steps following a <b>credit</b> <b>event</b> (i.e., adherence to a protocol) to elect cash settlement. [...] On October 23, 2007, the first ever LCDS auction was held for Movie Gallery.|$|E
2500|$|When a <b>credit</b> <b>event</b> {{occurs on}} a major company on {{which a lot of}} CDS {{contracts}} are written, an auction (also known as a credit-fixing event) may be held to facilitate settlement {{of a large number of}} contracts at once, at a fixed cash settlement price. [...] During the auction process participating dealers (e.g., the big investment banks) submit prices at which they would buy and sell the reference entity's debt obligations, as well as net requests for physical settlement against par. [...] A second stage Dutch auction is held following the publication of the initial midpoint of the dealer markets and what is the net open interest to deliver or be delivered actual bonds or loans. [...] The final clearing point of this auction sets the final price for cash settlement of all CDS contracts and all physical settlement requests as well as matched limit offers resulting from the auction are actually settled. [...] According to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), who organised them, auctions have recently proved an effective way of settling the very large volume of outstanding CDS contracts written on companies such as Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual. Commentator Felix Salmon, however, has questioned in advance ISDA's ability to structure an auction, as defined to date, to set compensation associated with a 2012 bond swap in Greek government debt. For its part, ISDA in the leadup to a 50% or greater [...] "haircut" [...] for Greek bondholders, issued an opinion that the bond swap would not constitute a default event.|$|E
50|$|A <b>credit</b> <b>event</b> {{triggers}} a swap where oftentimes the borrower has {{to terminate the}} contract and accept a settlement instead of honoring the remaining terms, because the <b>credit</b> <b>event</b> that occurred has essentially forced {{them to do so}} when they default.|$|E
40|$|This paper explores {{in depth}} {{the nature of}} default arrival and {{recovery}} implicit in the term structures of sovereign CDS spreads. We argue that, in principle, a term structure of spreads reveals not only {{the parameters of the}} market-implied mean arrival rates of <b>credit</b> <b>events</b> (λQ), but also the implicit loss rates (LQ) given <b>credit</b> <b>events.</b> Applying our framework to Mexico, Turkey, and Korea, three countries with different geopolitical characteristics and credit ratings, we show that a single-factor model in which λQ follows a lognormal process captures most of the variation in the term structures of spreads. Our models imply highly persistent λQ under the pricing measure, and economically significant risk premiums associ-ated with unpredictable future variation in λQ. We document significant correlations among these risk premiums and several economic measures of global event risk, financial market volatility and macroeconomic policy, both across maturities and countries. A potential role for (il) liquidity underlying the (small) mispricings of our model is explored along with the properties of the bid/ask spreads on the sovereign CDS contracts. ...|$|R
