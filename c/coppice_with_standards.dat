25|$|Originally, the {{silvicultural}} system now called coppicing was practiced solely for small wood production. In German {{this is called}} Niederwald, which translates as low forest. Later on in Mediaeval times farmers encouraged pigs to feed from acorns and so some trees were allowed to grow bigger. This different {{silvicultural system}} is called in English <b>coppice</b> <b>with</b> <b>standards.</b> In German this is called Mittelwald (middle forest). As modern forestry (Hochwald in German, which translates as High forest) seeks to harvest timber mechanically, and pigs are generally no longer fed from acorns, both systems have declined. However, there are cultural and wildlife benefits from these 2 silvicultural systems so both can be found where timber production or some other main forestry purpose (such as a protection forest against an avalanche) is not the sole management objective of the woodland.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the days}} of {{charcoal}} iron production in England, most woods in ironmaking regions were managed as coppices, usually being cut on a cycle of about 16 years. In this way, fuel could be provided for that industry, in principle indefinitely, {{as long as the}} nutrient mineral content of the soil was appropriately maintained. This was regulated by a statute of 1544 [...] of Henry VIII, which required woods to be enclosed after cutting (to prevent browsing by animals) and 12 standels (standards or mature uncut trees) to be left in each acre, to be grown into timber. <b>Coppice</b> <b>with</b> <b>standards</b> (scattered individual stems allowed to grow on through several coppice cycles) has been commonly used throughout most of Europe as a means of giving greater flexibility in the resulting forest product from any one area. The woodland provides not only the small material from the coppice but also a range of larger timber for jobs like house building, bridge repair, cart-making and so on.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to civilizations in relatively arid regions (such as Mesopotamia and Egypt), the Greeks, Romans, Celts, Britons, and Gauls all {{had access to}} forests suitable for using as fuel. Over the centuries there was a partial deforestation of climax forests {{and the evolution of}} the remainder to <b>coppice</b> <b>with</b> <b>standards</b> woodland as the primary source of wood fuel. These woodlands involved a continuous cycle of new stems harvested from old stumps, on rotations between seven and thirty years. One of the earliest printed books on woodland management, in English, was John Evelyn's [...] "Sylva, or a discourse on forest trees" [...] (1664) advising landowners on the proper management of forest estates. H. L. Edlin, in [...] "Woodland Crafts in Britain", 1949 outlines the extraordinary techniques employed, and range of wood products that have been produced from these managed forests since pre-Roman times. And throughout this time the preferred form of wood fuel was the branches of cut coppice stems bundled into faggots. Larger, bent or deformed stems that were of no other use to the woodland craftsmen were converted to the end of World War two. Since then much of these woodlands have been converted to broadscale agriculture. Total demand for fuel increased considerably with the industrial revolution but most of this increased demand was met by the new fuel source coal, which was more compact and more suited to the larger scale of the new industries.|$|E

Eighty-four direct competitors of selected future crop trees were girdled by double notching and peeling. Three years after girdling, 100 % of the treated trees had died. Approximately half of the girdled trees did not resprout. The occurrence of basal sprouting was very low, and more than 35 % of the sprouts had very low vigour. No correlation was found between sprouting and the diameter of the girdled trees or the distance to their nearest neighbour. A negative relationship between the diameter of the girdled tree and the stage of decline was recognized.

40|$|Abstract: The last {{surviving}} {{population of}} the scarce fritillary Euphydryas maturna (L., 1758) (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae) in the Czech Republic was studied using mark-recapture methods in 2002 {{in order to assess}} adult population structure and mobility, and by annual censuses of larval nests since 2001. The population is restricted to clearings within an isolated lowland deciduous forest situated in a densely populated landscape. Modelling demography using constrained linear models revealed that adult survival was constant in time and lower in males than in females; catchability was equal in sexes and varied in time, while recruitment was constant in sexes and time. Total population size was extremely small, numbering less then 200 individuals. Mobility was well described by a negative exponential function. Less than 5 per cent of individuals are predicted to cross distances of 500 metres, and long distance movements were highly unlikely. We conclude that the butterfly persists as a dynamic metapopulation that tracks early successional woodland clearings. Under recent high-forest management, its long-term survival is highly unlikely and the only chance for preserving it in the long term is the re-establishment of traditional <b>coppicing</b> <b>with</b> <b>standards,</b> which should provide a more continuous supply of the butterfly’s biotope...|$|R
40|$|Forests host {{approximately}} 80 % {{of species}} of all terrestrial organisms. Human pressure on forest ecosystems drastically increased during 20 th century and poses a constant threat to global biodiversity. The {{aim of this}} thesis is to summarize current knowledge {{of the effects of}} forest management on organisms and to identify underlying mechanisms. The oldest forms of forest management techniques were <b>coppicing</b> and <b>coppicing</b> <b>with</b> <b>standards</b> which enable relatively high biodiversity of species of early successional stages. Transition to classical intensive forestry caused shielding vegetation from the sun and decrease of heterogeneity. In recent decades some further intensification of management is practiced by using fast growing trees, but awareness of the need to establish sustainable forestry conditions strenghtens. Managed forest contrary to natural one has substantially lower average age of trees, it shows spatial homogeneity and old and dead trees, elements that are tied to high diversity of organisms, do not occur. Species composition of woods changes often. Anthropogenic management also disrupts and weakens the natural disturbation regimes.

40|$|Recently, in the coppices of Tuscany {{and many}} other regions of central Italy, {{a large number of}} {{standards}} are commonly released, often leaving all the oldest ones. This practice is linked to the concern for inability to sprout by the old standards stumps. The research was carried out in two <b>coppices</b> <b>with</b> <b>standards</b> of Quercus cerris located near San Gimignano (Siena, Italy), and harvested in the winter 2002 / 2003. The research focus on the evalutation {{of the effects of the}} felling of both different age standards (2, 3 or more rotations) and shoots (1 rotation); the stumps vitality and the shoots growth were studied. The results, two years after logging, show little differences about vitality between 2 - 3 rotations standards stumps and shoots stumps, even if the mortality of the oldest standards is highest (about 20 %). Significative differences are observed as related to the increment both in height and diameter of the shoots. The performances are different in each plot, however behaviour of standards are equal or higher than shoots. The results suggest that the low mortality of the 2 - 3 rotations standard stumps is wide compensated by growth increase of theirs shoots, therefore the harvest of older standard can enhance the development of the shoots by limiting the shading effect carried out by their crowns...|$|R
40|$|Standards in {{chestnut}} coppice system: {{cultural heritage}} or coltural requirement? This paper aims at evaluating {{the role of}} standards in chestnut coppices from a biological and functional perspective. In addition to {{a detailed analysis of}} Italian regulations on the issue, the technical definition of the term is analysed: (i) as for the functional role of standards; (ii) to assess whether the required functions are technically necessary and are being actually performed. In this contex, the results of an experimental trial are reported. The goal of the trial were to assess the shoots’ parameters, the stand productivity, the dynamics of canopy cover in <b>coppices</b> <b>with</b> or without <b>standards.</b> In 2001, at harvesting operations in a <b>coppice</b> aged 30 <b>with</b> <b>standards</b> managed by the local community, two experimental plots 2500 m 2 each were established. The two theses being compared were: simple <b>coppice</b> and coppixce <b>with</b> <b>standards</b> (100 standards per hectare). The released standards were qualified immediately after final harvesting. Sprouting ability, growth pattern and stool vitality were surveyed in March 2004 (at age 2), in May 2008 (at age 6) and in April 2010 (at age 8). First results highlighted the evidence of statistically {{significant differences between the two}} thesis. The high number of standards effected negatively both vitality and growth pattern of the stools. Simple coppice recorded a lower shoot mortality, a higher diametrical growth and canopy cover degree as well; the heigth growth was, on the opposite, significantly lower. These results, although referred to a limited lifespan (1 / 3 of the rotation time) and to one site only, underline productive, ecological and environmental benefits and as a consequence suggest the widening of the experimental network and the development of new, more relevant and consistent rules, making acceptable the simple coppice as a possible silvicultural choice to be applied to chestnut coppices...|$|R
40|$|During the Gallo-Roman period (1 st– 4 th century AD), forests covered {{two-thirds of}} the {{metropolitan}} French territory (Huffel, 1926). During the Middle Ages this proportion decreased dramatically to only 15 – 17 % of the land area. This residual forest was then severely damaged during the Renaissance period (15 th– 17 th century) by over-harvesting and anarchic management. When Colbert's Forest Ordinance was instituted in 1669 a gradual restoration took place. High forests produced mainly timber wood, especially for the navy and cask production, and coppices were used for firewood. This ordinance also {{marked the beginning of}} a true forest science, an approach which gained worldwide recognition. Since the 19 th century the land area of forests has increased owing to the impacts of various wars and a rural exodus which left considerable amounts of vacant agricultural land available for natural tree colonization. In addition, voluntary tree planting has occurred, often approved by governments for different objectives such as erosion control and increased timber production. In two centuries the forest area has increased by 67 % (Cinotti, 1996) and this trend is still important in transforming the landscape. Woodland area increases each year by an average of 68 000 ha (IFN, 2006), with additional areas being spontaneously colonized by woody species. From a management point of view, the decrease in the demand for firewood has led to the transformation of many <b>coppices</b> into <b>coppices</b> <b>with</b> <b>standards,</b> or to high forests, but this trend may be reversed in the coming years with the decreased use of fossil fuels for energy.

40|$|In 1999, {{the major}} windstorm, Lothar, damaged many beech {{stands on the}} French Lorraine {{limestone}} pla- teau. Some of them were <b>coppices</b> <b>with</b> <b>standards</b> (CWS) while others were high forest (HF) stands. The use of statistical models to compare the wind firmness of different stand structures is often limited by poor estimates of the individual wind loading. Available knowledge about the mechanics of windthrow processes such as wind loading could improve statistical modeling. Our aim was to identify the main trees and site risk factors for beech and to compare wind firmness of both stand structures by fitting such a model. We developed a windthrow model with mixed effects, {{which is based on}} a simplified mechan- ical analysis of the wind-induced stresses and Weibull's theory of fracture. This analysis revealed the rel- evancy of including the product of the crown diameter and the square of the tree height, known as the bending moment coefficient, in the model. The Weibull-based model was compared with multiple logis- tic regressions. Both models were fitted using tree and site factors on 384 dominant beeches (196 in CWS and 188 in HF) from 51 plots with comparable site conditions between the two stand structures. Damage mainly increased with tree height, although it also slightly increased with crown width. The bending moment coefficient used in the Weibull-based model more effectively accounted for tree size and tree shape effects than the logistic regressions. Stand structure showed an interesting second-order effect since the increase of risk with the increase of the bending moment coefficient was higher for HF. Including a random plot effect significantly improved the model likelihood and, therefore, took partly wind-induced spatial variability into account. To apply Weibull's theory to windthrow, many assumptions that require further investigation must be made regarding the brittle behavior and the distribution of stresses in the root-soil plate...|$|R
40|$|The {{silvicultural}} {{management of}} coppicing {{has been very}} common in deciduous forests in many European countries. After decades of decline of this practice, socio-economic changes might induce a revival valuing the biomass as a resource. New insights in the ecological processes that regulate plant diversity are relevant for a sustainable forest management. While studies on long-term changes are available, the short-term dynamics of the coppice forest understorey {{has not yet been}} explored. In this context, it is interesting to evaluate the species compositional changes, including the processes of species turnover and species impoverishment (nestedness) and to investigate the role of plant functional traits. For this purpose, we resampled a chronosequence of complex coppice beech forests of the Central Apennines (Italy) monitoring the short-time species dynamics of five years (i. e. from 2006 to 2011) in three age classes, i. e. post-logged, recovering and old coppice stands (0 – 16, 17 – 31 and > 32 years, respectively). In contrast to our expectation, declining species richness appeared only in the recovering stands, while the landscape scale (between-stand) heterogeneity, except for post-logged and recovering stands in 2011, did not change over five years. Significant temporal nestedness was found in each stage of succession. However, the rate of species turnover and species impoverishment do not significantly differ among the three age classes, indicating their constant importance along the forest regeneration after disturbance. Only in the early stage of forest regeneration after coppicing, species compositional changes are reflected by functional changes with surviving understorey species having clonal regeneration traits. Our results suggest an overall landscape-scale stability (and sustainability) of this coppice forest system. We conclude with management indications, highlighting the importance of maintaining the traditional local approach (<b>coppicing</b> <b>with</b> <b>standards</b> in small 0. 5 – 1. 0 ha sized management units with a ca 30 -year rotation cycle) where active coppice parcels are interspersed by abandoned stands. © 2017 Institute of Botany, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republi...|$|R

40|$|THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE TEACHING OF FORESTRY IN FRANCE - After the {{disturbed}} {{days of the}} Revolution and of the Empire, it {{was found}} advisable to reestablish the Forest-Service in France; and the need appeared, of {{the foundation of a}} school in which would be trained the officers of this service. It was then decided, in 1824, to open a school of Forestry in Nancy, {{in the vicinity of the}} silver fir forests of the Vosges, of the beautiful broadleaved crops of the Alsacian plain and in the middle of the <b>coppices</b> <b>with</b> <b>standards</b> of Lorraine. The first Director and Professor of forestry in the new school was an Alsacian, Bernard Lorentz, born at Colmar in 1775. For seven years, Lorentz belonged to the forest-service of the provinces, — French at that time, — of the leftbank of the Rhine and thus had the opportunity of making a thorough study of the works of the German foresters, just issued, and specially of the famous treatises of Georg-Ludwig Hartig. There was no complete work on forestry at that moment,in France, and Lorentz had to improvise his teaching and to have recourse to the German publications, at least in the beginning. Lorentz was a professor at Nancy from 1825 till 1830. The object of Mr. Huffel's account, is to expose the evolution of the teaching during these six years. It shows all what had been borrowed to G. L. Hartig by the first professor of forest science at Nancy and what was the celerity with which Lorentz succeeded in creating an entirely original doctrine, well fit to the natural and economical conditions of France. The lectures from 1825 to 1929 which Lorentz drew up in writing, are carefully analysed in Mr. Huffel's review, the second part of which contains a detailed account of the practical work accomplished by the pupils of the royal forestry school from 1825 to 1830. There are studies on topography, management and reports on surveys and especially on the forest survey which Mr. Lorentz directed in the forests on the two slopes of the lower Vosges where he had the opportunity of exposing his views on the selection system of the silver- fir. This survey ended by a visit to a broadleaved forest of the Alsacian plain, at Haguenau, in which Lorentz showed to his young students an oak 2 m 40 in diameter at breast-height, still young and vigorous and which he presumed to be at least 500 years old...|$|R
