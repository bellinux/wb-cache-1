Here, we assessed the biochemical and morphological impacts of acidification on the calcification of Amphistegina lessonii and Marginopora vertebralis exposed to different pH conditions. We measured growth rates (surface area and buoyant weight) and Ca-ATPase and Mg-ATPase activities and calculated shell density using micro-computer tomography images. In A. lessonii, we detected {{a significant decrease in}} buoyant weight, a reduction in the density of inner skeletal chambers, and an increase of Ca-ATPase and Mg-ATPase activities at pH 7. 6 when compared with ambient conditions of pH 8. 1. By contrast, M. vertebralis showed an inhibition in Mg-ATPase activity under lowered pH, with growth rate and skeletal density remaining constant. While M. vertebralis is considered to be more sensitive than A. lessonii owing to its high-Mg-calcite skeleton, it appears to be less affected by changes in pH, based on the parameters assessed in this study. We suggest difference in biochemical pathways of calcification as the main factor influencing response to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> <b>levels,</b> and that A. lessonii and M. vertebralis have the ability to regulate biochemical functions to cope with short-term increases in acidity...|$|E
40|$|Esophageal {{disorders}} {{are common in}} the general population and can be associated with significant morbidity. Several new diagnostic techniques for esophageal disorders have become available in recent years. These include capsule pH-metry, high-resolution manometry, impedance combined with either pH-metry or manometry, and high-frequency ultrasound. Capsule pH-metry is useful in children and in patients who cannot tolerate the conventional pH-metry catheter. It has the advantage of not interfering with a patient’s usual meals and activities during the 24 h study. High-resolution manometery is easier to perform and interpret than conventional manometry. This has led to improved diagnosis of various esophageal motility disorders. Impedance measures the movement of liquid and gas in the esophagus. When combined with pH-metry, impedance can confirm that retrograde bolus movement (ie, reflux) is occurring while simultaneously measuring <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> <b>levels.</b> It has also highlighted the importance of weakly acidic reflux in patients who do not respond to proton pump inhibitors. Weakly acidic reflux cannot be diagnosed with pH-metry alone. Impedance combined with manometry can determine whether a manometric abnormality leads to abnormal bolus clearance. In the past, this was performed with fluoroscopy, yet impedance is equally effective and does not carry the risk of increased radiation exposure. High-frequency ultrasound is currently a research tool to image the esophageal wall, particulary the two muscle layers, in real time during swallows and at rest. It has broadened our understanding of the pathophysiology of esophageal motility disorders...|$|E

30|$|Unfavourable {{environmental}} parameters usually produce <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> <b>level</b> {{that have}} been reported to cause considerable stress affecting the growth and other normal metabolic activities of the animals (Chizinski et al. 2008). Moreover, <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> <b>level</b> can exert profound effects on ionoregulation and acid–base balance in decapod crustaceans (Ellis and Morris 1995). The normal variation of <b>pH</b> <b>in</b> oceanic water of 35 ppt salinity is 7.8 – 8.2 (Knutzen 1981). However, in estuarine habitats the <b>pH</b> <b>level</b> can drop due to mixing of freshwater and values of between 6.9 and 7.8 are common (John et al. 2011). In addition, intensive photosynthesis (Bowmer and Muirhead 1987); respiration (Knutzen 1981); organic decomposition (Albrecht et al. 1997) and industrial effluents (Boyd 1982) can alter the <b>pH</b> <b>level.</b> Most of the mangrove soil is fully buffered, having a <b>pH</b> <b>in</b> the range of 6 – 7, but some have a low pH, due to reduction of sulphate to sulphide (a common constituent of mangrove soils). In some cases, increased rates of sulphate reduction occurs leading to anaerobiosis and increased sulphide in the mangrove sediments, thus giving a much lower value of pH than normal (Kathiresan and Bingham 2001). Considering such variation of <b>pH</b> <b>level</b> <b>in</b> mangrove areas, a wide range of pH from 5 to 9 was taken for the present experimentation. In our study, trilobite larvae of C. rotundicauda were influenced by <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the <b>pH</b> <b>level</b> considerably on the oxygen demand. The maximum oxygen consumptions were calculated mostly <b>in</b> the alkaline <b>pH</b> 8 and 9 during the early 4  h of the experiment. However, the acidic pH (5 and 6) tested had showed somewhat consistent oxygen consumption pattern during the 12 -h experiment period. This result was similar to that reported by Suniza et al. (2011), where they showed that a wide fluctuation in oxygen consumption was observed under different pH ranges tested with normal oxygen consumption falling at pH 6. This suggests that the trilobite larvae tend to prefer slightly acidic conditions for their regular physiological activities. This could be because of their habitat preference, as these larvae remain for a portion of their life cycle near inshore waters and estuaries. An increase in oxygen consumption was observed at pH 5, 6 and 7 after a duration of 12  h in our study. This pattern was also observed in T. gigas trilobite larvae, where a sudden increase in the consumption rate at pH 6, 7 and 8 was reported. Overall, the results from both these studies suggests that the variable pH is rather critically important for trilobite larvae as any variation of the optimal parameter can make larvae under stress, even within a short time interval. In other crustaceans also <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> <b>level</b> have shown to affect their feeding behaviour, growth and even the oxygen consumption, which directly affected their metabolic rates (Allan and Maguire 1992; Zanotto and Wheatly 1993; Chen and Lin 1995; Chen and Chen 2003).|$|R

This study presents the effect of pH changes on the antioxidant activity and productivity of the blue green alga Spirulina (Arthrospira) platensis. The algal dry weight (DW) was greatly enhanced at pH 9. 0. The highest content of chlorophyll a and carotenoids (10. 6 and 2. 4 mg/g DW, respectively) was recorded at pH 8. 5. The highest phenolic content (12. 1 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) /g DW) was recorded at pH 9. 5. The maximum production of total phycobiliprotein (159 mg/g DW) was obtained at pH 9. 0. The antioxidant activities of radical scavenging activity, reducing power and chelating activity were highest at pH 9. 0 with an increase of 567, 250 and 206 % compared to the positive control, respectively. Variation in the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) was also reported. While the high alkaline pH may favor the overproduction of antioxidants, normal cell metabolism and membrane function is unaffected, as shown by growth and chlorophyll content, which suggests that these conditions are suitable for further studies on the harvest of antioxidants from S. platensis...|$|E
40|$|Two {{virtually}} unknown, nitrogenfixing {{plant species}} - Sesbania rostrata, an African shrub and Azolla, a fern from Asia - show potential for replacing chemical fertilizers and increasing crop production. Current work {{is designed to}} pave the way for their use by small farmers but researchers are also looking at long-term ways to incorporate their characteristics into food plants themselves so that in the future farmers maysowself-fertilizing crops. Nitrogen is indispensable for plant growth but it is not always present in sufficient quantities in the soil, especially when continuous, intensive cultivation does not allow the soil to regenerate its stocks. Nitrogen inputs that can be directly assimilated by plants (e. g., nitrates and urea) are also important for maintaining healthy growth. In many African countries, however, these imported chemical fertilizers are rarely applied because they are too expensive for the farmers. Plants capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen are therefore of great interest to these countries. Two wild plants that have recently been studied by researchers in Africa show considerable potential in this regard. Sesbania rostrata, which occurs naturally in the wet lowlands of the Senegal River valley, is a leguminous plant which means that it can assimilate free nitrogen thanks to the symbiotic relationship between its roots and the rhizobial bacteria found in the soil. These micro-organisms penetrate the roots and inoculate the cells of the root skin which results in the formation of the nodules in which nitrogen fixation takes place. The special feature of Sesbania is that it also has such nodules on its stems, which enables it to assimilate all available nitrogen even when the soil is waterlogged. Sesbania can produce about 40 kg of nodules per hectare compared to an average of 5 - 6 kg for other leguminous plants. If cut after 50 days of growth, this shrub, which can reach 3 metres in height, can be used as a green manure. In this way, it can provide about 200 kg of nitrogen per hectare per year, compared to 100 - 150 kg for other leguminous plants. Doubling yields Research by scientists in the Casamance, Senegal, has helped to determine the optimum growing conditions for this plant. Optimum development is obtained by long days and high temperatures (30 C). To ensure good nodule development on both the stems and roots, the soil must be inoculated with rhizobium. Site-specific tests have shown that by ploughing in such green manure one can double the yields of sorghum and irrigated rice and increase the yield of rainfed rice by 70 %. The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) has also experimented with interplanting rows of Sesbania and lowland rice. The results show that the prunings of this plant spread between rice rows represent the equivalent of up to 120 kg of urea per year. Further research is currently underway in Cote d'lvoire and Martinique on the use of S. rostrata to fertilize banana fields. This plant has also shown potential for use as a mulch in the rainy season when lowland areas are flooded. Research in northern Cameroon is concentrating on the growth of Sesbania itself. It appears that this plant grows better on moist than well-drained soils. It is thus particularly suited to lowland or irrigated rice fields. Although such research has only just begun, it already shows the considerable promise of this plant, whether it is used as green manure or mulch. It remains to be seen, however, if such success on experimental farms can be easily repeated on the fields of small farmers. The first problem to overcome is the need to produce at low cost sufficient quantities of the inoculum required to guarantee a high level of nitrogen fixation. Considerable effort will also be required to train farmers who have no experience in the use of green manures and to whom its benefits may not be immediately evident. In addition to growing the plant, it must be cut and then ploughed in, a process that demands both time and tools that are not always available. Finally, this technique also requires careful planning because it takes about six months to prepare a crop of S. rostrata before planting the rice. At the scientific level, this plant is also the subject of considerable interest because of the potential of harnessing its symbiotic relationship with rhizobium to fix nitrogen. It is hoped to be able to transfer this plant's ability to form caulinary nodules to other leguminous plants. Research in this direction is too recent to expect great results, but it has already improved our knowledge of the nitrogen fixation process Floating fertilizer Azolla is the second of these nitrogen factories' that is holding the attention of scientists. This aquatic fern, which floats on the surface of calm waters and has lona been used as a green manure by farmers in Asia, is also found in Africa. In the Koular Valley of Senegal, for example, rice fields which have never been treated with urea have concentrations of nitrogen and carbon that are four times higher than those of adjacent fields. This is due to the presence of Azolla which grows naturally in these lowland plots and is spread by the farmers when they transplant their rice The use of Azolla in Africa was first mentioned in expedition-reports dating from the beginning of the century. After being harvested from the surface of waterways and dried, it was burned so that its potassiumrich ashes could be used to make soap. This small fern is thus a plant of many uses. Each of its leaves contains a central cavity that harbours the cynobacterium Anabaena azollae, more commonly known as the blue-green algae, which are responsible for nitrogen fixation This is a very fast-growing plant capable of doubling its biomass in two or three days. Its reproduction is also prolific: when it reaches 1 - 2 cm in diameter, its older parts break off and form new plants. The greatest problem with Azolla is the risk of it becoming an aggressive weed. Under unfavourable conditions sexual reproduction takes over and helps to ensure its survival. Furthermore, Azolla thrives under varying ecological conditions, including different pH, light, temperature and salinity levels, as long as it has a good water environment, preferably a shallow basin that enables its roots to touch the soil, and a source of phosphorus. This little plant is virtually a 'nitrogen factory' given its ability to produce 23 - 170 kg of nitrogen in 60 days. Most experience with Azolla has been in rice fields where it is either dried and spread like a fertilizer, or used like a green manure. Trials in Senegal have shown that when grown with rice, Azolla reduces evaporation, minimizes the need for weeding, and increases production by about 50 % when used with double-cropping systems instead of traditional cropping methods. To avoid any problems, a good inoculant is essential. It can be produced in shaded plastic or clay bowls that are covered to avoid contamination. Research scope As with Sesbania, there has been little use of Azolla as a green manure outside experimental farms. Its potential seems greater, however, because it can be grown at the same time as rice and does not require much more labour. There are two major obstacles that need to be overcome. First, researchers have not yet discovered a way to grow the cyanobacterium without its host plant, which considerably reduces the scope for genetic manipulation. Second, it is difficult to induce sexual reproduction in Azolla, which makes it difficult to conserve its strains. Efforts are being redoubled, however, to understand the interactions between this cynobacterium and its host plant in order to exploit this natural process. The development of more resistant strains, notably those that tolerate <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> <b>levels,</b> varying photoperiodicity and high light intensity, is another promising research direction. To combat decreasing soil fertility in Africa and elsewhere, green manure appears to be a promising solution for the future. These two plants warrant considerable attention but it must be remembered that implementation techniques need to be developed to make such progress accessible to small farmers. If research in this direction eventually results in breeding food crops that can fertilize themselves, it will open the door to another, more accessible green revolution: one that will reduce - rather than increase - the need for chemical fertilizers. Two virtually unknown, nitrogenfixing plant species - Sesbania rostrata, an African shrub and Azolla, a fern from Asia - show potential for replacing chemical fertilizers and increasing crop production.

40|$|Sub-acute rumen {{acidosis}} (SARA) is {{a problem}} with major economic importance in dairy production. The definition of SARA is a low pH (< 5. 3 - 5. 5) in the rumen during several hours in the day. Due to lack of other confirmatory clinical sign, SARA is diagnosed by measuring pH of the ruminal fluid. According to the definition continuous measurement of rumen pH is needed to diagnose SARA but until now methods for that purpose only exist for fistulated animals. In recent years, diagnostic tools in the biological field based on wireless telemetric technology have been developed. A magnetoelastic sensor which can swell and shrink in response to different <b>pH</b> <b>levels</b> was evaluated <b>in</b> this project. The sensor was tested in water, phosphate buffer, VOS buffer, McDougall’s buffer, rumen liquid as well and in vivo in a cannulated cow. This sensor was prepared by casting layers of polymer on a magnetic ribbon, set up this ribbon in a plastic frame and then wrap ping it with magnetic paper. A box like wooden structure was used in case of in vitro which can conserve heat and provide a continuous rumen temperature. The prepared sensor upon application of a magnetic field produced mechanical vibration and thus production of a magnetic flux which can be received by a pickup coil. The measurement system consisted of the magnetoelastic sensor, a coil for excitation and pick up of the sensors resonance frequency, a control unit and a computer for signal processing and evaluation.

We present spectroscopic evidence that, at low pH and from sub-stoichiometric to stoichiometric amounts of metals, macrochelate and multi-histidinic Cu(II) and Ni(II) complexes form; but, from neutral pH and above, both copper and nickel bind to individual histidine residues. NMR, EPR, UV–Visible (UV–Vis) and UV–Visible CD spectroscopy were used to understand about the variety of complexes obtained at low pHs, where amide deprotonation and coordination is unfavoured. A structural transition between two coordination geometries, as the pH is raised, was observed.

Findings demonstrate that <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> water <b>level,</b> <b>pH</b> and calcium affect species composition, which {{can be seen as a}} negative effect. When defining a negative effect more strict, it can be concluded that only pH has a negative effect on Sphagnum dominated bogs, as findings suggest that high alkalinity led to rapid internal phosphate mobilization, peat disintegration and Sphagnum die-off. Die-off intensified with sulphate pollution. None of the articles really discussed groundwater in terms of origin, pathway, and related composition. In addition, the processes of acidification and methanogenesis are still not well known. Hopefully, this paper will encourage the inclusion of research on origin and pathway of groundwater, and on the different processes. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} a 6 -day storage period on <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH,</b> acid-binding capacity, <b>level</b> of organic acids and ethanol of three liquid coproducts [liquid wheat starch (LWS), mashed potato steam peel (PSP) and cheese whey (CW) ] and two liquid {{compound}} diets [liquid grower diet (LGD) and liquid finisher diet (LFD) ] were studied. All products, except LWS, showed a significant decrease <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> and acid-binding capacity during storage. At {{the end of the}} storage period, all products reached a pH of between 3. 5 and 3. 9. In general, it can be concluded that the lactic acid content, {{and to a lesser extent}} the acetic acid content, increased dramatically during storage. In contrast, the ethanol content increased significantly in the liquid compound diets only. The pattern of <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> and organic acids during the 6 -day storage period was different between the liquid coproducts and the liquid compound diets. At the start of storage, liquid coproducts are already in the 'middle' of the fermentation process, while liquid compound diets need approximately 24 - 36 h before fermentation begins. Consequently, in practice a different approach to obtain fermented diets is needed for liquid coproducts and liquid compound diets...|$|R
40|$|Background. Super EBA (SE) and MTA are {{considered}} to be among the best retrograde filling materials used in endodontic surgery. Since the post-operative course is characterised by phlogosis and an acid pH, it is worth asking whether this environment influences the hardening of these materials. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate in vitro the influence of pH on the Vickers hardness of MTA and SuperEBA. Methods and materials. Twelve MTA and 12 SuperEBA disks were prepared and left to harden, for 24 hours and 1 hour respectively, <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> 5 and pH 7 buffer solutions (n. 6 for each group). After careful polishing of the free surface the final hardness was evaluated using a micro-hardness meter; an optical microscopy assessment was also performed as a qualitative analysis to evaluate the indentations. Data were analysed with one-way ANOVA and Scheffe post hoc test. Results. Means of Vickers values and standard deviation were: pH 7 MTA 38, 59 (2, 59); pH 5 MTA 4, 02 (1, 57); pH 7 SE 18, 46 (5, 38); pH 5 SE 20, 65 (5, 49). MTA at neutral pH is associated with the best hardness; this is dramatically reduced if the samples are exposed to an acid solution. Instead, SuperEBA, characterised by a lower hardness, is practically unaffected by <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the <b>pH</b> <b>level,</b> showing only a slight increase <b>in</b> an acid <b>pH</b> environment. The differences were statistically significant (p< 0, 001) except for the groups of ph 7 SE vs pH 5 SE. Conclusions. An acid pH significantly influences the hardness of MTA but not of SuperEBA...|$|R
40|$|Faecal {{cultures}} {{were used}} to compare the prebiotic effects of a new fructan containing high solubility inulin (HSI) and of a well-established prebiotic containing oligofructose (OF) with a negative control (CT). <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> the intestinal microbiota, pH, ammonia, volatile organic acids and lactic acid were monitored during incubation. Molecular techniques for microbial enumeration indicated that both HSI and OF led to a significant increase in bifidobacteria (P≤ 0. 05) and lactobacilli (P≤ 0. 05) compared to the control. Significant <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the <b>pH</b> and <b>levels</b> of ammonia with both inulin-type fructans were observed, as well as higher levels of acetic, lactic and formic acids (P≤ 0. 05). The fermentative metabolism appeared to be faster on OF than on HSI. Both OF and HSI showed clear prebiotic effects, but had differences in fermentation kinetics because of to the different degree of polymerization (DP). This study provides proof for the prebiotic effectiveness of HSI, and shows that inulin-type fructans with higher DP might have a prolonged bifidogenic effect, thus could extend the saccharolytic metabolism and low pH to the distal parts of the colon...|$|R
40|$|The {{carotid body}} plays an {{important}} role in initiating protective responses to hypoxemia. The primary oxygen sensing cells are the glomus or type 1 cells. Hypoxia evokes the secretion of neurotransmitters from these cells which then excite afferent nerves. This response is mediated via membrane depolarization and voltage-gated Ca 2 + entry. Studies from this laboratory have revealed that membrane depolarization in response to hypoxia is primarily the result of inhibition of background K+ channels which show strong similarities to the acid sensitive tandem-P-domain K+ channels TASK- 1 and TASK- 3. The background K+ channels of type- 1 cells are also very sensitive to inhibition of mitochondrial energy metabolism and, in excised patches, appear to be directly activated by ATP. Thus these TASK-like background channels would appear to confer the ability to sense <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> oxygen <b>levels,</b> <b>pH</b> and metabolism upon the type 1 cell. The key issue of whether the effects of hypoxia are mediated through <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> metabolism remains unanswered but the effects of inhibition of mitochondrial energy metabolism and of hypoxia upon background K+ channels is mutually exclusive suggesting that there is a close link between metabolism and oxygen sensing in the type 1 cell...|$|R
40|$|The {{complement}} system {{is key to}} innate immunity and its activation {{is necessary for the}} clearance of bacteria and apoptotic cells. However, insufficient or excessive complement activation will lead to immune-related diseases. It is so far unknown how the complement activity is up- or down- regulated and what the associated pathophysiological mechanisms are. To quantitatively understand the modulatory mechanisms of the {{complement system}}, we built a computational model involving the enhancement and suppression mechanisms that regulate complement activity. Our model consists of a large system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) accompanied by a dynamic Bayesian network as a probabilistic approximation of the ODE dynamics. Applying Bayesian inference techniques, this approximation was used to perform parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis. Our combined computational and experimental study showed that the antimicrobial response is sensitive to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> and calcium <b>levels,</b> which determines the strength of the crosstalk between CRP and L-ficolin. Our study also revealed differential regulatory effects of C 4 BP. While C 4 BP delays but does not decrease the classical complement activation, it attenuates but does not significantly delay the lectin pathway activation. We also found that the major inhibitory role of C 4 BP is to facilitate the decay of C 3 convertase. In summary, the present work elucidates the regulatory mechanisms of the complement system and demonstrates how the bio-pathway machiner...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} four {{different}} ante-mortem stressors (exercise, emersion, starvation and a patent infection with the parasite Hematodinium sp.) on post-mortem processes {{have been investigated}} in the abdominal muscle of Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus by measuring <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the <b>pH,</b> the <b>levels</b> of glycogen, l-lactate, arginine phosphate, ATP, ADP, AMP, IMP, HxR, Hx and the adenylate energy charge (AEC) over a time course of 24 h with samples being taken at 0, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h. The acute stresses of intense exercise and 2 h emersion resulted in a premature onset of anaerobic glycolysis, leading both to an enhanced glycogen depletion rate and an early accumulation of l-lactate. The chronic stressors, starvation and parasite infection, resulted in a complete ante-mortem depletion of muscle glycogen and consequently the failure of post-mortem glycolytic fermentation. Post-mortem pH and ATP inter-conversion were significantly altered in chronically stressed animals. Ante-mortem, a rapid, almost complete depletion of arginine phosphate was observed in all stress groups. The AEC was altered significantly by all stresses, indicating a strong energy demand. The findings suggest that ante-mortem stressors strongly influence the post-mortem biochemical processes. The laboratory-based results are compared to 'field' data and effects on post-harvest product quality are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Filled {{hydrogel}} particles {{consisting of}} emulsified oil droplets encapsulated within a hydrogel matrix were fabricated {{based on the}} phase separation of proteins and polysaccharides through aggregative and segregative mechanisms. A 3 % (wt/wt) pectin and 3 % (wt/wt) caseinate mixture at pH 7 separated into an upper pectin-rich phase and a lower casein-rich phase. Casein-coated lipid droplets added to this mixture partitioned into the lower casein-rich phase. When shear was applied, an oil-in-water-in-water (O/W 1 /W 2) emulsion consisting of oil droplets (O) contained within a casein-rich dispersed phase (W 1) suspended in a pectin-rich continuous phase (W 2) was formed. Acidification from pH 7 to 5 promoted adsorption of pectin onto casein-rich W 1 droplets, forming filled hydrogel particles. Particles were then cross-linked using transglutaminase. Particles were assessed for stability to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH,</b> increasing <b>levels</b> of salts (sodium chloride and calcium chloride), and susceptibility to lipid oxidation. Both cross-linked and not cross-linked particles were stable at low pH (pH 2 - 5). At high pH, cross-linked particles maintained their integrity while not cross-linked particles disintegrated. Particles were stable to sodium chloride (0 - 500 mM). Calcium chloride levels above 4 mM resulted in system gelation. The rate of lipid oxidation for 1 % (vol/vol) fish oil encapsulated within filled hydrogel particles was {{compared to that of}} oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by either Tween 20 or casein. Emulsions stabilized by Tween 20 oxidized faster than either filled hydrogel particles or casein stabilized emulsions, while filled hydrogel particles and casein stabilized emulsions showed similar oxidation rates. Using an in-vitro digestion model, the digestion of lipid encapsulated within filled hydrogel particles was compared to that of a casein stabilized oil-in-water emulsion. Results showed similar rates of digestion for both hydrogel and emulsion samples. Attempts to fabricate particles using free oil (rather than emulsified oil) were unsuccessful and resulted in the formation of large non-encapsulated oil droplets (d ~ 10 μm). By controlling particle concentrations of biopolymer, water, and oil, it was possible to fabricate particles that were highly resistant to gravitational separation which was attributed to the equivalent density of the continuous and particle phases. Results highlight the potential applications and versatility of this delivery system...|$|R

Blood ions and gases were measured at rest and during recovery. (V) over dotE, end tidal CO 2 pressure (PETCO 2) and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were measured continuously during rest, exercise and recovery periods. Arterial CO 2 pressure (PaCO 2 (pre)) was estimated from PETCO 2 and tidal volume (V-T). RER at 20 s of exercise and until 50 s during recovery was significantly lower than RER at rest. Despite no <b>change</b> <b>in</b> arterialized blood <b>pH</b> <b>level,</b> PaCO 2 (pre) was significantly higher in the last 10 s of exercise and until 70 s during recovery than the resting value. (V) over dotE increased during exercise and then decreased during recovery; however, it was elevated and was significantly higher than the resting value until 155 s (p< 0. 05). There was a significant relationship between (V) over dotE and PaCO 2 (pre) during the first 70 s of recovery in each subject. The results suggest that PaCO 2 drives (V) over dotE during the first 70 s of recovery after light impulse-like exercise. Elevated (V) over dotE in the interval from 70 s until 155 s during recovery might be due to neural factors...|$|R
40|$|Concrete {{is usually}} the {{preferred}} material for construction of structures in contact with water during their service life. Early age exposure to water is beneficial for curing of concrete structures. However, the pollution of water from freshly cast concrete in contact with water has not been investigated in detail. A {{significant increase in the}} alkalinity has recently been observed in a stream in contact with freshly installed concrete culverts. High alkalinity has caused distress to fresh water fish in the stream. A preliminary laboratory study was commenced to explore the effect of leaching of alkali into water from freshly placed concrete. Freshly cast concrete specimens were exposed to fresh water, covering a range of conditions observed in the field such as volume of concrete/volume of water, age of exposure and cement content. Analysis of the results indicated that early age contact with fresh concrete can lead to an increase <b>in</b> the <b>pH</b> <b>levels</b> of water up to 11, similar to the <b>levels</b> of <b>pH</b> observed <b>in</b> pore water inside freshly cast concrete. It was noted that until an age of 4 days from casting of concrete, the age of exposure does not significantly affect the <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the peak <b>pH</b> <b>levels</b> of water. Continuous monitoring of water in contact with concrete also indicated that the <b>pH</b> <b>levels</b> diminish with time, which is attributed to the possible reaction of calcium hydroxide with atmospheric carbon.

40|$|A multi-stress {{model has}} been {{developed}} in the Netherlands on a national scale to forecast <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> plant species composition due to acidification, eutrophication and dessication. This model, called SMART-MOVE, consists of: a soil module (SMART 2) used for calculating <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> groundwater <b>level,</b> <b>pH</b> and nutrient availability, and a vegetation module, consisting of regression equations that describe {{the relationships between the}} probability of occurrence and environmental factors. These environmental factors represent average Ellenberg indication values for pH, availability of water and nutrient availability. Salinity was also included since in large parts of the Netherlands salinity is of major importance for species composition. Essential input data for these modules, such as groundwater level and seepage flux, can be calculated with the National Groundwater Model, for example. In this study relationships were calculated between the Ellenberg indication values and the relevant soil factors: pH, average spring groundwater table, biomass production, nitrogen production, concentrations of several nutrients and chloride concentration for both terrestrial and aquatic systems. Where it was possible to use a sigmoid model, to cope with the original ordinal and limited scale of indication values, the explained variance increased by 5 - 10 %. In the regression analyses, almost 7000 vegetation releves from a variety of ecosystems could be used, satisfying relationships with Ellenberg values were found for pH, average spring groundwater table and biomass and nitrogen production. These relationships are used to connect the soil module with the vegetation module and quantify the confidence of the model outcomes. Average Ellenberg indication values can be concluded to be succesful as estimates for the abiotic conditions in models like SMART-MOVE...|$|R
40|$|Chapters {{one and two}} of {{this work}} contain a study of helically-coiled spiral coprolites. Spiral coprolites with complex microstructures have been {{interpreted}} as enterospirae – fossilized valvular intestines (Fritsch 1907, Williams 1972). However other evidence {{seems to indicate that}} recent dogfish produce spiral faecal pellets with complex microstructures (McAllister 1985). The search for an answer to the problem of whether certain spiral coprolites are fossilized intestines or faecal pellets includes a study of diet and the physiology of digestion in fishes, with particular attention to those with valvular intestines; the sharks, skates and rays. The faunal associations of various coprolite assemblages and the fossil evidence for the presence of the valvular intestine in fishes and other groups are also reviewed. Chapter one includes a revision of the definitions, terminology and taxonomy of coprolites. In the second chapter the various forms of spiral coprolites in the Lower Carboniferous of Scotland are examined. Actualistic research into taphonomic processes in fishes is divided into two areas described in chapters three and five. Chapter three covers various aspects of the physical processes which affect fish carcasses, with particular emphasis on small sharks. A major aspect of this work is concerned with the post mortem build-up of gas in the body cavity and its taphonomic consequences. Chemical aspects of decay and mineralization form the basis of chapter five. The roles of <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>pH</b> and the <b>levels</b> of calcium magnesium and phosphates in early mineralization are investigated. An investigation of the taphonomy and diagenesis of the Wardle Shales fish beds is contained in chapter four. The Lower Carboniferous Wardie Shales fish fauna consists of palaeoniscoids, sharks and acanthodians preserved in siderite concretions. The preservation of uncrushed calcified cartilage is particularly striking. Well-preserved spiral coprolites are exceedingly common. Wide-ranging conclusions help to clarify the processes that have led to the preservation of the remarkable assemblages of coprolites at Anstruther and Wardie and of the Wardie fishes...|$|R
