2500|$|There {{are many}} reasons that a {{geotechnical}} engineer would recommend a deep foundation over a shallow foundation, such as for a skyscraper. Some of the common reasons are very large design loads, a poor soil at shallow depth, or site constraints like property lines.

The naming conventions may vary between engineering disciplines and firms. Deep foundations can be made out of timber, steel, reinforced concrete or prestressed concrete.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{some examples}} of design problems for offshore foundations, drawn from the jack-up industry and the wind turbine industry. The examples are chosen to illustrate some general points about foundation design, geotechnical engineering and its interaction with other disciplines. The first example is drawn from {{the assessment of the}} safety of installation of jack-up units (large mobile offshore drilling rigs). It illustrates how more rational approaches can be achieved through a deeper use of probabilistic methods in both the prediction of performance and the assessment of field observations. The second example also comes from jack-up practice, but has wider application too: it addresses the classical problem of the performance of foundations under combined loading, and how this can be understood in a simple theoretical and practical framework based on plasticity theory. The final example comes from the renewables sector, where the rapidly expanding offshore wind industry poses new foundation challenges for geotechnical engineers. Practical and economic foundation solutions are required if the UK is to meet its ambitious plans to exploit larger turbines in deeper waters. Both conventional (monopile) and novel solutions (suction <b>caissons,</b> screw <b>piles)</b> to the foundation problem are discussed. The paper also demonstrates how interactions with other disciplines can enrich geotechnical engineering, illustrated by specific practical examples from the author's experience...|$|R

40|$|Karst is a {{problematic}} geology located throughout the United States. It is problematic {{because it is}} very hard; however the mineral composition and the near vertical, pinnacled bedding of the bedrock (limestone) is vulnerable {{to the formation of}} solution cavities and sinkholes. The upper layers of the limestone are typically polluted with voids, massive clay seams and artesian conditions. The overburden soils above the limestone are typically silts and clays that are susceptible to large settlements when heavy foundation loads are placed on them. For heavily loaded structures or structures that are very sensitive to settlement, deep foundations are necessary. Traditional deep foundations include drilled cast-in-place concrete <b>caissons</b> and driven <b>piles.</b> These foundation types typically transfer the foundation loads to competent rock at depth. However, in the karstic formations, ”competent rock ” may be underlain by voids and clay seams. Therefore, the actual load-carrying capacity of foundations bearing above these problem zones may be less than required.

Test results indicate that, for soil with low stiffness acceleration decays {{in the process of}} earthquake wave propagating upwards;adding <b>piles</b> under the <b>caisson</b> could decrease the earthquake responses of both the foundation and structure, so the reinforcement of the system in resisting earthquakes is expected;frequency characteristics of the responses at soil surface, foundation and structure are all different from each other depending on their own natural vibration characteristics;and for the interaction between soil and foundation, or foundation and structure, only the earthquake component with similar frequency with both interacting sides can cause remarkable earthquake interaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{engineering}} {{community has}} devoted much effort {{to understanding the}} response of soil-structure systems to seismic ground motions, but {{little attention to the}} effects of an outcropping fault offset. The 1999 earthquakes of Turkey and Taiwan, offering a variety of case histories of structural damage due to faulting, have (re) fueled the interest on the subject. This paper presents a methodology for design of bridges against tectonic deformation. The problem is decoupled in two analysis steps: the first (at the local level) deals with the response of a single pier and its foundation to fault rupture propagating through the soil, and the superstructure is modeled in a simplified manner; and the second (at the global level) investigates detailed models of the superstructure subjected to the support (differential) displacements of Step 1. A parametric study investigates typical models of viaduct and overpass bridges, founded on <b>piles</b> or <b>caissons.</b> Fixed-head <b>piled</b> foundations are shown to be rather vulnerable to faulting-induced deformation. End-bearing piles in particular are unable to survive bedrock offsets exceeding 10 cm. Floating piles perform better, and if combined with hinged pile-to-cap connections, they could survive much larger offsets. Soil resilience is beneficial in reducing <b>pile</b> distress. <b>Caisson</b> foundations are almost invariably successful. Statically-indeterminate superstructures are quite vulnerable, while statically-determinate are insensitive (allowing differential displacements and rotations without suffering any distress). For large-span cantilever- construction bridges, where a statically determinate system is hardly an option, inserting resilient seismic isolation bearings is advantageous as long as ample seating can prevent the deck from falling off the supports. An actual application of the developed method is presented for a major bridge, demonstrating the feasibility of design against tectonic deformation. © 2008 Institute of Engineering Mechanics, China Earthquake Administration and Springer-Verlag GmbH...|$|R
40|$|A {{simplified}} method with a dynamic Winkler model {{to study the}} seismic response of composite caisson-piles foundations (CCPF. 11 CCPF: composite caisson-piles foundation.) is developed. Firstly, with the dynamic Winkler model, the kinematic response of the CCPF subjected to vertically propagating seismic S-wave is analyzed by coupling the responses of <b>caisson</b> part and <b>pile</b> part. Secondly, a simplified model for the foundation-structure system is created with the structure simplified as a lumped mass connected to the foundation with an elastic column, and through the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) this model is enabled to solve transient seismic problems. Thirdly, the proposed method for the seismic response of CCPF-structure systems is verified by comparison against 3 D dynamic finite element simulation, in which the Domain Reduction Method (DRM. 22 DRM: Domain Reduction Method.) is utilized. Lastly, the mechanism and significance of adding piles in improving the earthquake resistance of the foundation and structure is analyzed through an example with different soil conditions. Discovered {{in this study is}} that adding <b>piles</b> under the <b>caisson</b> is an efficient way to increase seismic resistant capability of the soil-foundation-structure system, and the main mechanism of that is the elimination of the pseudo-resonance. 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|As {{the first}} part of a {{sequence}} focusing on the dynamic response of composite caisson-piles foundations (CCPFs 1), this paper develops a simplified method for the lateral response of these foundations. A Winkler model for the lateral vibration of the CCPF is created by joining the two components, the <b>caisson</b> and the <b>pile</b> group, where the four-spring Winkler model is utilized for the caisson and axial-lateral coupled vibration equations are derived for the pile group. For determining the coefficients of the four-spring Winkler model for the caissons, embedded footing impedance is used and a modification on the rotational embedment factor is made {{for the sake of the}} geometrical difference between shallow footings and caissons. Comparisons against results from finite element simulations demonstrate the reliability of this modified four-spring Winkler model for caissons in both homogenous and layered soils. The proposed simplified method for the lateral vibration of CCPFs is verified also by 3 D finite element modeling. Finally, through an example, the idea of adding <b>piles</b> beneath the <b>caisson</b> is proved to be of great significance to enhance the resistance of the foundation against lateral dynamic loads...|$|R
