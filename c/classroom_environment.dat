5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} is outdoor learning. Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at home and in school. The outdoors stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they perceive to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of thinking. The program does nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard <b>classroom</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E
5|$|The program {{originally}} focused {{almost exclusively}} on Scoutcraft skills, some elements of the Patrol Method, and First Class Boy Scout requirements. In a major cultural shift during the 1970s, Wood Badge was modified to train Scouters in eleven specific leadership competencies. The National Council has updated it several times since then, and during 2001–2002 implemented an overhaul that emphasized a prototypical troop as a method for teaching team leadership and problem-solving skills. The training is delivered through a lecture <b>classroom</b> <b>environment</b> and a short outdoor camping experience. It {{is a key element}} of the overall leadership training program.|$|E

30|$|During {{the whole}} life, school {{education}} gives people an overall, systematic and in-depth influence, and this period {{is an important}} process for learning and self-shaping of people (Wang, 2007). There are several instruments used in prior research to assess perceptions of <b>classroom</b> learning <b>environment.</b> The implication from prior research is that students’ outcomes {{might be related to}} perceptions of classroom learning environment; in other words, students’ achievement might be improved by creating better <b>classroom</b> learning <b>environments</b> (Fraser, 1986; Madu, 2010; Tas, 2016). Also, with integrating technology into education, growing number of researchers have focused on smart <b>classroom</b> learning <b>environment</b> and new forms of <b>classroom</b> learning <b>environment</b> like flipped <b>classroom</b> learning <b>environment</b> in recent years (Butzler, 2014; Jena, 2013).|$|R
25|$|Teachers play {{a crucial}} role in the {{implementation}} of strategies aimed at improving academic success and classroom functioning in individuals with executive dysfunction. In a <b>classroom</b> <b>environment,</b> the goal of intervention should ultimately be to apply external control, as needed (e.g. adapt the environment to suit the child, provide adult support) in an attempt to modify problem behaviours or supplement skill deficits. Ultimately, executive function difficulties should not be attributed to negative personality traits or characteristics (e.g. laziness, lack of motivation, apathy, and stubbornness) as these attributions are neither useful nor accurate.|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} {{has been criticized}} for its lack of troubleshooting support. Teachers in Peru are told to handle problems in one of two ways. If the problem is a software issue, they are to flash the computer, and if it is a hardware problem, they are to report it. In the <b>classroom</b> <b>environment</b> this black-boxing approach is being criticized for causing the teachers and students to feel disconnected with, and confused by the laptop, which results, in many cases, in the laptops eventually going unused. Several defects in OLPC XO-1 hardware have emerged in the field, and laptop repair is often neglected by students or their families (who are responsible for maintenance) due to the relatively high cost of some components (such as displays).|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Dover Area School District {{agreed to}} {{participate}} in a pilot program to develop a new way to evaluate teachers that, in part, takes into account student achievement. Several other York County school districts also participated. The pilot program had 104 K-12 entities, including: nine career and technical centers, nine charter schools and nine intermediate units. Beginning in January 2012, York County some schools will use the new evaluation method and provide feedback to the Department of Education. This new evaluation will not be used to determine an educator’s official 2011-12 assessment. Under the new evaluation system, 50% of the evaluation of a teacher will be based on an observation divided into four categories: planning and preparation, <b>classroom</b> <b>environment,</b> instruction, and professional responsibilities. The other half will be based on student achievement (15 percent will be building-level data, 15 percent will be teacher-specific data, and 20 percent will be elective). The new evaluation system has both announced and unannounced observations. The system includes meetings between the teacher and evaluator before and after the direct observation of a lesson.|$|E

500|$|On January 1, 2002, the National Council {{required}} all councils {{to implement}} the updated Wood Badge for the 21st Century program which removed much of the Boy Scout-specific information from the program. This allowed the National Council to designate Wood Badge as the advanced leadership training program for Cub Scout, Boy Scout, Varsity [...] Scout, Venturing, council leaders, district leaders, and professional staff. It replaced both Boy Scout Leader Wood Badge and Cub Scout Trainer Wood Badge. Unlike the prior Wood Badge course which was conducted entirely outdoors, the modified Wood Badge program is delivered through a lecture <b>classroom</b> <b>environment</b> and in a short outdoor camping experience. Participants spend {{the first three days}} in a classroom setting, and the last three days camping. Teaching aids include VCRs, laptop computers, and video projectors. [...] Session titles include Leading Change, Problem Solving, Valuing People and [...] Leveraging Diversity, Managing Conflict, and Coaching and [...] Mentoring.

2500|$|In conclusion, {{it is not}} {{a matter}} whether a student is {{motivated}}, unmotivated, or more motivated than other students- it’s a matter of understanding what motivates students before providing a certain type of feedback.

30|$|Among {{the limited}} {{existing}} empirical studies, Alkharusi et al. (2014 a) examined the inter-correlations between students’ {{perceptions of the}} assessment tasks and the <b>classroom</b> assessment <b>environment.</b> Their focus, however, was on the gender difference in a research context where {{male and female students}} were educated separately, rather than coeducationally, in the Middle East. They found statistically significant gender differences concerning the perceptions of the assessment tasks and <b>classroom</b> assessment <b>environment.</b> For both male and female students, learning-oriented <b>classroom</b> assessment <b>environment</b> was congruently correlated with planned learning, authenticity, student consultation, transparency, and diversity. Performance-oriented <b>classroom</b> assessment <b>environment,</b> however, was only correlated with student consultation among females while it was associated with all assessment task variables among males.|$|R

2500|$|Expressed {{needs are}} {{difficult}} to assess and address in the <b>classroom</b> <b>environment,</b> as they are needs directly expressed by learners through behaviour or words.

40|$|Inclusive {{education}} {{has become a}} cornerstone of many government policies in {{an increasing number of}} countries, yet teachers have been found to hold mixed attitudes towards its implementation and usefulness. This article, using English terminology and thinking, aims to extend previous research on the effect of teacher attitudes towards inclusion in <b>classroom</b> learning <b>environments,</b> and to explore perceived adequacy of support, levels of stress, and willingness to include pupils with certain difficulties. Teachers (N = 95) completed questionnaires on attitudes to inclusion, <b>classroom</b> learning <b>environment,</b> support and stress. Pupils (N = 2, 514) completed a questionnaire on <b>classroom</b> learning <b>environment</b> only. Teacher attitudes towards including special educational needs pupils in mainstream settings were found to {{have a significant impact on}} how they managed their <b>classroom</b> learning <b>environments</b> and how adequately they perceived available support. Teachers with more positive attitudes towards inclusion were reported by their pupils to have <b>classroom</b> <b>environments</b> with greater levels of satisfaction and cohesiveness and lower levels of friction, competitiveness and difficulty than for those with teachers who held less positive attitudes. Teacher attitudes towards inclusion increased with greater perceived adequacy of both internal and external support. Teachers were less willing to include pupils with behavioural difficulties than pupils who were able/gifted or had physical difficulties, irrespective of attitude to inclusion...|$|R
2500|$|Of course, {{achieving}} such a {{goal is not}} automatic nor easy, as {{he suggests}} {{that the role of}} the teacher is critical to this process. Students need to be helped by teachers to separate themselves from unconditional acceptance of the conditions of their own existence. Once this separation is achieved, then students may be prepared for critical re-entry into an examination of everyday life. In a <b>classroom</b> <b>environment</b> that achieves such liberating intent, one of the potential outcomes is that the students themselves assume more responsibility for the class. Power is thus distributed amongst the group {{and the role of the}} teacher becomes much more mobile, not to mention more challenging.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a mixed methods investigation of student attitudes toward blended and online courses. Specifically, the study compares {{two groups of}} university freshmen writing students. These groups respectively took writing classes in traditional <b>classroom</b> <b>environments</b> (without individual computers for each student in the classroom) and in blended <b>classroom</b> <b>environments</b> (with individual computers for each student in the classroom). The research questions were the following: RQ 1 : What {{are some of the}} general prevailing student attitudes toward blended <b>classroom</b> <b>environments</b> and online <b>classroom</b> <b>environments?</b> RQ 2 : If students take writing courses in a blended environment, will their attitudes toward blended and online education differ from the attitudes of students who only take traditional writing courses? RQ 3 : Will students who take blended writing courses have more favorable attitudes toward blended and online learning than students who do not take writing courses in blended environments? To answer the above research questions, a set of specific questions was presented as part of a survey to the students in both groups. Also, some qualitative data were generated in response to three open-ended questions about blended and online courses. The survey results were analyzed statistically and the qualitative data were subjected to corpus analysis and specific interpretation. Overall, the attitudes expressed by the students in this research suggest that there are some major differences between student groups in terms of their general attitudes to blended and online learning. The quantitative analysis showed statistically significant support for the idea that students with previous experience in blended classrooms have more favorable attitudes toward blended and online courses than students without previous experience in blended classrooms. The qualitative results showed a wide range of expressive and divergent opinions among all of the respondents, and the results also provided revealing answers to the research questions...|$|R
