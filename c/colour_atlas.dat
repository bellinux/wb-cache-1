Attila Hencz �attila. hencz@matfyz. cz� Department: Department of Software and Computer Science Education Supervisor: doc. Alexander Wilkie, Dr. �wilkie@cgg. mff. cuni. cz�, Department of Software and Computer Science Education Abstract: We investigate the colorimetric accuracy of stochastic sampling in the wavelength domain for realistic rendering purposes. In particular, {{we consider the}} impact of three specific design choices in a rendering system on {{the accuracy of the}} overall result: how exactly spectral samples are splatted into the final result spectrum, how many spectral channels one uses in the result images, and the impact of Hero Wavelength Spectral Sampling (HWSS) compared to the stand- ard monochrome technique. We provide experimental results, comparisons and evaluation of sampling high-resolution spectra that originate from measurements of real paint samples found in <b>colour</b> <b>atlases,</b> and normed light sources defined by the CIE. The latter include both smooth and spiky spectra, so the used com- bination of reflectances and light spectra provides a representative body of input values that allows to draw conclusions that are relevant for practical rendering work.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Developments in technology have meant that computercontrolled imaging devices are becoming more powerful and more affordable. Despite their increasing prevalence, computer-aided design and desktop publishing software has failed to keep pace, leading to disappointing colour reproduction across different devices. Although {{there has been a}} recent drive to incorporate colour management functionality into modern computer systems, in general this is limited in scope and fails to properly consider the way in which colours are perceived. Furthermore, differences in viewing conditions or representation severely impede the communication of colour between groups of users. The approach proposed here is to provide WYSIWYG colour across a range of imaging devices through a combination of existing device characterisation and colour appearance modeling techniques. In addition, to further facilitate colour communication, various common colour notation systems are defined by a series of mathematical mappings. This enables both the implementation of computer-based <b>colour</b> <b>atlases</b> (which have a number of practical advantages over physical specifiers) and also the interrelation of colour represented in hitherto incompatible notations. Together with the proposed solution, details are given of a computer system which has been implemented. The system was used by textile designers for a real task. Prior to undertaking this work, designers were interviewed in order to ascertain where colour {{played an important role in}} their work and where it was found to be a problem. A summary of the findings of these interviews together with a survey of existing approaches to the problems of colour fidelity and communication in colour computer systems are also given. As background to this work, the topics of colour science and colour imaging are introduced...|$|R

40|$|WOS: 000392559300002 International audienceAmong the {{characteristic}} properties of timber from natural tree stands, {{particularly those in}} arid and semi-arid zones, variations in colour are decisive in the uses made of the wood as a high added-value visible material, in joinery and cabinet-making for example. This {{study was conducted to}} help promote the aesthetic value of a woody species which is common in Algeria but under-researched, the Mt. Atlas mastic tree, Pistacia atlantica Desf. Variations in wood colour were assessed from samples cut from the sapwood and heartwood of mastic trees from two different bioclimatic regions in north-western Algeria. The colour assessments were made at the Forest and Timber Resources Laboratory (LERFoB) in Nancy, France, using a spectrophotometer with measurement and display software. The results indicate variations between the two regions in the <b>colour</b> of Mt. <b>Atlas</b> mastic tree wood (for the three chromatic components L*, a* and b*) and among the different trees (component L*). The colorimetric components of the lighter-coloured sapwood, especially brightness (L*) and the red-green component (a*), are very different to those of the heartwood. From this we infer that environmental factors have an influence on the colorimetric characteristics of the wood in this species, as well as the intrinsic individual characteristics of each tree. Finally, brightness (L*) and the red-green (a*) and blue-yellow (b*) components vary between the different types of mastic tree wood...|$|R

40|$|Mapping {{of coastal}} Quaternary {{deposits}} in the Primera Angostura area forms {{part of an}} ongoing comprehensive research programme, started in 1991, concerning the recent evolution of the Strait of Magellan. Two field campaigns were carried out on land {{within the framework of the}} Italian Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartid e (PNRA). The first, in 1991 concerned the sedimentology and geology of coastal Pleisto-Holocene deposits, while the second, carried out in 1994 once the cartographic and geomorphological data had been processed, was to check the maps of the old coastlines and postglacial, Quaternary and chiefly marine, deposits. The research also embraces two other projects, "International Geological Correlation Programme" TGCP 367 "Late Quaternary Coastal Records of Rapid Change" and "Coastal Geomorphology Laboratory at the Centro Austral Antartico" (RAS-PYS project) funded by the Autonomous Region of Sardinia within its "Developing Countries" programme. One of the objectives of the research is the publication of an Atlas of the mainly Holocene geological and geomorphological features of the Strait of Magellan coasts, which will be useful for formulating evolutionary hypothesis of the Strait in very recent times. The Atlas is currently being completed but its publication will depend on the retrieval of funds to print the maps in <b>colour.</b> The <b>Atlas,</b> that includes the colour map presented here (n. 5112) and three other published maps (De Muro el AI., 1996 a; Di Grande et al., 1996; DeMuro et al., 1996 b), will consist of 12 sections at the 1 : 50. 000 scale of the east coast of the Strait of Magellan. It will not only contain thematic maps of the evolutionary characteristics of the Late Pleistocene-Holocene sea, but is also intended as a cartographic document of the geomorphologic and evolutionary features of the continental and transitional deposits underlying the marine deposits. Three general thematic maps 1 : 200. 000 in scale of the eastern region of the Strait of Magellan have already been published (Brambati et al., 1995 a; DeMuro et al., 1995; Di Grande et al., 1995). In the main the preparation of these maps, at least as regards the cartographic basis, has been far from easy. At best we could refer to the 1 : 50. 000 scale maps compiled by the Chilean l. G. M., which, besides the drawback of not covering the whole area, had a contour spacing of 50 metres. This created even greater difficulties in evaluating minor height differences, which was not infrequent. For areas not covered by the 1 : 50. 000 scale sections, we resorted to the 1 : 100. 000 preliminary maps drawn up by the Chilean E. Na. P. (Empresa Nacional de Petroleo), the 1 : 250. 000 maps of the Chilean l. G. M. and at times also to other l. G. M maps in smaller scales. In some instances, in solving objective difficulties it was necessary to use different scales at the same time, in addition to the various scale nautical charts for near coastal regions. We also used approximately 1 : 60. 000 scale aerial photos provided by the Servicio Aerofotogrammetrico Fuerza Aerea de Cile (S. A. F.) as well as Landsat TM and MSS satellite images acquired with funds of the Italian Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antarticle (PNRA) and processed at Cagliari University's Photogeology and Remote Sensing Laboratory, using funds from the RAS-PVS Project for setting up a Remote Sensing Laboratory at the Centro Austral Antartico" (see satellite images on attached map). During surveying the attention was focused on those forms, processes and deposits associated with the action of the Holo-Pleistocene sea, and, for a better regional perspective of the problems, with zonation of old glaciation. Moreover, the extremely intense coastal and eolian dynamics in progress today have also been taken into account. For completenss the general features of the fluvial and lacustrine landforms and deposits have also been mapped. The mapping criterion follows the example of recent works by the National Group (Italy) of Physical Geography and Geomorphology for various themes (coastal, submarine, continental). Moreover, for certain graphic and explanatory aspects, the cartography of the Atlas of the Coasts of the Strait of Magellan is innovative and represents a new and modern contribution to thematic mapping...|$|R

Three thematic general maps at the 1 : 200, 000 scale on the eastern region of the Strait of Magellan have already been published (Brambati et Al., 1995 a; De Muro et Al, 1995; Di Grande et Al., 1995). Marine and transitional deposits. 	Marine and transitional deposits and forms regularly occupy the coastal belt from Punta Arenas to Cabo Foward. They are mainly represented by gravel, sand and silt deposits, or more rarely, by simple erosion surfaces. 	Four main orders of terraced sequences have been mapped. 	The first, and oldest, was found regularly between altitudes of 18 and 25 meters. Sand and silt deposits prevail here. Because of its stratigraphic position and by radiocarbon dating this first order was referred to the Lower Holocene without the exclusion that its base may belong to the Upper Pleistocene, while the depositional environment is transitional. 	The Second Order, is distributed between 6 and 11 metres, and is mainly represented by fossiliferous gravel deposits; sands and silts are also present. It regularly covers most of the coastal stretch and extends in the backland {{at the level of the}} main fluvial and lacustrine depressions. At times, it presents well-preserved complex sedimentary structures of paleobeach environments (berms, spits and/or bars). The age of formation of the marine deposit, by C 14 dating, is on average between 6,OOO and 7,OOO years B. P. 	The Third Order strictly follows the present beach, between altitudes of 3 and 5 metres, at the foot of the Second Order terrace. It is made up of gravels and sands and refers preferably to a marine environment. 	At a slightly lower elevation, presence of small, terraced (Fourth order), marine remnants, younger than in the Third Order, was rarely noticed. Conclusion 	The 6 th map of the Coastal Atlas of the Strait of Magellan provides a zoning of the area distribution of the most significant deposits, forms and processes relating to the coastal belt between Punta Arenas and Rio Quema Angusta - Peninsula Brunswick. 	From the Map it can be seen that the morphogenesis of the area was strictly controlled by the processes associated with the advance and retreat of the Magellan Glacier, and subordinately, by the main morphodynamic event represented by post deglaciation marine ingression. 	The Holocene paleogeographic evolutionary picture of the Patagonia-Tierra del Fuego area, is mainly controlled by the imposing phenomenon of glacio-isostasy, though it cannot be ruled out that the morphogenesis subsequent to deglaciation may have been affected by mild neo-tectonic movements. 	As previously observed (DeMuro et Al., 1995 b), marine ingressions that produced terracing of the coasts and backland presumably depend on prevalently positive movements of the whole coastal system, related to the final deglaciation of the region. 	It is deduced that parallelly following deglaciation, a strong parallel uplift of the mean sea level was produced with initially transgressive stratigraphic effects. Isostatic rebound, that probably occurred rather late compared to post-glacial transgression, is superimposed with very complex and articulate phenomena, that are under study at present and will be the subject of future works. 	From an examination of map n. 6 / 12 of the Atlas of the coasts of the Strait of Magellan, it emerges that all marine and transitional terraces that have been found are later than the last glaciation, and are superimposed on its products with clear angular discordance and sharp erosive truncation. This is deduced both from the stratigraphy of the outcrops and from strata geometry and C 14 dati...|$|R

40|$|The {{first edition}} of Dr. Liang-Che Tao 9 ̆ 2 s {{monograph}} on Transabdominal Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsy was published in 1990. His personal experiences were a helpful guide to cytopathologists and completely revolutionized the approach to clinical diagnosis of space-occupying lesions in the abdomen. The second edition, Transabdominal Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsy: A <b>Colour</b> <b>Atlas</b> and Monograph, by Dr. Grace C. H. Yang is simply exquisite. The book size is compact and easy to carry, yet extensively expanded, with each abdominal organ having a dedicated chapter packed with concise yet comprehensive up-to-date, practical information. The illustrations are extraordinary, an aesthetic treat for readers, encompassing all possible presentations of a tumor. The monograph is divided into 12 chapters. The organization of the monograph follows a natural flow beginning with the history and basic principles of aspiration biopsy, description of procedures and techniques, approaches to the interpretation of transabdominal fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), comprehensive chapters on individual abdominal organs and ancillary techniques essential for transabdominal aspiration biops...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} measure the {{variation}} of colour related to some external and internal factors, 136 samples of wools were collected in 1979 and 1980 in a flock of black Polwarth sheep kept in the South of Victoria State, in Australia, 38 " latitude South in open air all year long. The genetic formula of these animals at Agouti, Brown and Extension loci was probably aa, B+B+, E+E+. The animals were female or wethers, they were rugged for control or non rugged with a coat opaque to visible and U. V. radiations and cut off at 2. 5, 3. 5 months or one year of wool growth. The colour measurements were made with a <b>colour</b> <b>atlas</b> based on the D. I. N. System. Except for very rare cases, the growing wool (at {{the base of the}} staple) was in the grey scale (which goes from pure white to jet black, without a hue component). With age one could see a greying or silvering of the coloured fleece. This is due to {{an increase in the number}} of white fibers and seems independant from light exposure. Due to exposure to solar radiation there was a fading of the staple to the range ot browns. This means the addition of a spectral colour component: the hue, orange in this case. The fading first affects the tip on the staple, about 2 cm after one year of exposure...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} impact of the colour of a drug's {{formulation}} on its perceived effect and its effectiveness and to examine whether antidepressant drugs available in the Netherlands are different in colour from hypnotic, sedative, and anxiolytic drugs. DESIGN: Systematic review of 12 published studies. Six studies examined the perceived action of different coloured drugs and six the influence of the colour of a drug on its effectiveness. The colours of samples of 49 drugs affecting the central nervous system were assessed using a <b>colour</b> <b>atlas.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Perceived stimulant action versus perceived depressant action of colour of drugs; the trials that assessed the effect of drugs in different colours were done in patients with different diseases and had different outcome measures. RESULTS: The studies on perceived action of coloured drugs showed that red, yellow, and orange are associated with a stimulant effect, while blue and green are related to a tranquillising effect. The trials that assessed the impact of the colour of drugs on their effectiveness showed inconsistent differences between colours. The quality of the methods of these trials was variable. Hypnotic, sedative, and anxiolytic drugs were more likely than antidepressants to be green, blue, or purple. CONCLUSIONS: Colours affect the perceived action of a drug and seem to influence the effectiveness of a drug. Moreover, a relation exists between the colouring of drugs that affect the central nervous system and the indications for which they are used. Research contributing {{to a better understanding of}} the effect of the colour of drugs is warranted...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} no {{reported}} surveys of oral mucosal lesions among the elderly in Asian countries. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to determine the prevalence of oral mucosal lesions among 65 - 74 -yr-old, community-dwelling elderly Chinese in Hong Kong and to determine the prevalence of lesions in denture wearers, tobacco smokers, and alcohol drinkers. A total of 537 noninstitutionalized 65 - 74 -yr-olds were interviewed and clinically examined in an oral health survey conducted in 1991. In the survey, the elderly underwent a systematic examination of their oral mucosa by one of the three examiners with the aid of an overhead light. The examiners were trained and calibrated before and during the survey, and a specially prepared <b>colour</b> <b>atlas</b> of oral mucosal lesions was used for lesion recognition. No mucosal lesions were detected in 64 % of the elderly. In the 193 elderly subjects with lesions, 80 % exhibited only one lesion. There was no difference in prevalence between men and women. The more common lesions, each being found in 5 - 7 % of the elderly, were lingual varicosities, frictional keratosis on the buccal mucosa, denture stomatitis on the palatal mucosa, and denture-induced hyperplasia in the maxillary and mandibular buccal sulcus. Denture wearers had a higher prevalence of lesions (40 %) than nonwearers (32 %). There was no difference in the prevalence or number of oral mucosal lesions between those defined as users of tobacco and alcohol and those defined as nonusers in this study. No confirmed oral malignancies were found. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Lameness {{is one of}} the {{greatest}} infringements of welfare in dairy cows. The objective of this study was to investigate associations between milk yield and foot lesions causing lameness in Chilean dairy cattle with the hypothesis that if we can demonstrate that lameness reduces yield, and so income, from lame dairy cows then we have both economic and welfare arguments for reducing lameness in dairy cattle. For one year, all lame cows from seven farms with Holstein Friesian cattle were treated by their herdsmen. Herdsmen were trained by the researcher and a <b>colour</b> <b>atlas</b> was utilised to assist in diagnosis of lesions. All abnormalities on the foot and the suspected cause of lameness were recorded, and cattle were treated. A two-level hierarchical model with repeated monthly test-day yields within cows was used to investigate the impact of double sole (DS), sole ulcer (SU), white line disease (WLD), digital dermatitis (DD) and all 'other' causes of lameness on milk yield before and after treatment. There were 1, 635 cows with complete data. Cattle with a DS were higher yielding than cattle that were never lame with a reduction in yield from four months before treatment. Cattle lame with DD were higher yielding than non-lame cattle before and after treatment. For all causes of lameness, yield increased the month after treatment. We conclude that lesions causing lameness reduced the milk yield of dairy cows in these seven herds in Chile. We discuss the current evidence base for prevention of lameness in dairy cows and hypothesise that rapid treatment is a feasible current approach to improve cow welfare immediately and probably reduce milk lost; more evidence for effective prevention is required. ...|$|E
