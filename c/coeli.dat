5|$|On 20 October 1478, Catherine {{made her}} last will, {{recorded}} by a Dalmatian priest, {{in the presence}} of seven witnesses, six of whom were Franciscans of Ara <b>Coeli.</b> She expressed a wish to be buried before the main altar of Ara <b>Coeli.</b> Considering herself entitled to dispose of the Bosnian crown, she named Pope Sixtus IV and his successors guardians of the kingdom, obligating them to enthrone her son should he convert back to Christianity or else her daughter should she reconvert. Most of her personal belongings were inherited by her courtiers. Her chapel inventory was left to Saint Jerome's Church for the Slavic Nation, while the saint's relics were to be passed to Saint Mary's Church in Jajce. She decreed that, if her son never returned to the Christian faith, King Thomas's silver sword left in Dubrovnik for safekeeping should be handed to her nephew by Vladislav, Balša Hercegović. The Queen died five days after composing the will, which was immediately taken to the Pope along with her husband's sword and spurs.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{was buried}} {{according}} to her wishes, but her tombstone was moved from the floor to a wall of Ara <b>Coeli</b> during works on {{the interior of the}} church in 1590. The original epitaph was destroyed at that time, but the Roman calligrapher Giovanni Battista Palatino had recorded it in 1545 and published two years later. It was uniquely bilingual and digraphic, written both in Latin language and script and in Bosnian language and Cyrillic. Only the Latin epitaph was restored, and can be found on her tombstone today.|$|E
25|$|In his will, Frederick of Haseldorf, {{meanwhile}} Prince-Bishop of Dorpat, bequeathed {{his personal}} belongings to Porta <b>Coeli</b> Convent, however Vitslav II, Prince of Rügen, captured and withheld the bequest, {{so that in}} 1291 the abbess of Porta <b>Coeli</b> waived its claim, likely in return for some form of compensation. The deed of waiver of 17March 1291 shows the oldest preserved version of the nunnery's seal, since 1955 officially used by the Himmelpforten municipality.|$|E

25|$|The Mass of Repose, {{commemorating the}} sending {{of the soul}} to God, was {{followed}} by the recitation of the Regina <b>Coeli.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Regina <b>Coeli</b> (Queen of Heaven) is an anthem of the Roman Catholic Church which {{replaces the}} Angelus at Eastertide (from Holy Saturday until the Saturday after Pentecost). It {{is named for}} its opening words in Latin. The Regina <b>Coeli</b> {{was the subject of}} {{numerous}} intonations throughout the centuries by known and unknown composers. Not all attributions are correct however, as an often quoted Regina <b>Coeli</b> by Joseph Haydn had other authors. Of unknown authorship, the anthem was in Franciscan use {{in the first half of}} the 13th century. Together with three other Marian anthems, it was incorporated in the Minorite Roman Curia Office, which the Franciscans soon popularized everywhere, and which by order of Pope Nicholas III (1277–1280) replaced all the older breviaries in the churches of Rome.|$|E

25|$|Porta <b>Coeli</b> never {{developed}} a sustainable farming of its own. Its landed estates and other revenue-yielding assets did not form a closed compound but were dispersed {{in the central}} and northeastern part of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen (Stade Geest and Bremian Elbe Marshes). Like many other nunneries Porta <b>Coeli</b> lived of feudal leases, tithes and other dues, earlier often in kind, such as also socage and serjeanty. Porta <b>Coeli</b> let out most of its farmland on socage to farmers, and ran only smaller and closer parts of all its lands through its Vorwerke using labour of farmers subject to serjeanty. The Vorwerke were managed by the (ad)vocate (Vogt). Besides his military task of protecting, his task was to prevent farmers from poaching, pasturing on nunnery's land, forbidden lumbering and peat-cutting and of pursuing culprits, collecting the dues and leases.|$|E
50|$|De Martyribus-The {{last may}} perhaps be {{compared}} with the commemorations that come at the end of Lauds in, for instance, the present Roman Divine Office. There are also sets of antiphons, super Cantemus Domino et Benedicite, super Laudate Dominum de <b>coelis,</b> and De Martyribus. In the Bangor book there are collects to go with the Te Deum, given apart from the preceding, as though they formed part of another Hour; but in the Turin fragment they, with the text of the Te Deum, follow the Benedicite and its collects, and precede the Laudate Dominum de <b>coelis.</b>|$|R

25|$|With {{establishing}} Porta <b>Coeli</b> as a prince-archiepiscopal outpost {{to observe}} and surveil the peasants' ambitions Gerard and Simon of Lippe pursued Prince-Archbishop Gebhard's long-term project of enforcing the reign over the free peasants, e.g. manifesting in Gebhard's earlier subjection of the Stedingers. The integration of Himmelpforten Convent into the prince-archiepiscopal temporalities was fixed in a deed, issued in 1255, {{on the occasion of}} moving the convent to then Eylsede/ Eulsete village (literally: Eylo's/Eilhard's seat), later adopting the Low Saxon translation tor Hemmelporten or to der Himilporten of the convent's Latin name Porta <b>Coeli</b> (Gate of Heaven; modern standard German: Himmelpforten).|$|E
25|$|Echoing the Byzantine {{depiction}} of Christ Pantocrator, the Eastern Church portrayed Mary as the regal Queen of Heaven. As this theme {{spread to the}} West, prayers such as the Regina <b>Coeli,</b> Ave Regina Caelorum, and Salve Regina were composed.|$|E

50|$|A {{few days}} after Faciens misericordiam, the Pope issued the bull Regnans in <b>coelis,</b> which {{indicated}} more details about the upcoming ecumenical council. Though directed to convene in 1310, the council was delayed due {{to the length of}} the trial against the Templars, but was eventually convened as the Council of Vienne from 1311 to 1312 in Vienne, Isère, southeastern France.|$|R
25|$|On 9 November 1926, the Fascist {{government}} {{enacted a}} new wave of emergency laws, taking as a pretext an alleged attempt on Mussolini's life several days earlier.

25|$|The name of Porta, meaning Porta <b>Coeli</b> – i.e. Pearly Gates – , {{refers to}} the {{architecture}} of the richly ornamented western façade of the minster with its Roman triumphal arch portal and a gallery underneath the cruciﬁxion group that did not at all correspond to the strict stipulations of the order.|$|E
25|$|While {{the date}} of the {{composition}} of Ave Regina Coelorum is uncertain, conjecture that it antedates the fourth century seems to be without any warrant of external or internal evidence. It is found in the St. Alban's Book of the twelfth century. The Regina <b>Coeli</b> has been traced back to the twelfth century.|$|E
50|$|Pope Clement V {{caused the}} Council to meet by issuing the bulls Faciens misericordiam and Regnans in <b>coelis</b> in August 1308. The city chosen was Vienne, {{which is on}} the Rhône River in the south of modern France and at the time was outside the direct control of Philip IV.

25|$|The {{opposite}} {{point to}} the midheaven {{is known as the}} imum <b>coeli.</b> For astrologers the nadir or IC traditionally indicates the circumstances {{at the beginning and end}} of a person's life, their parents and the parental home, and their own domestic life. In quadrant house systems it lies on the cusp of the 4th house of the horoscope.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} systems of house division. In most, the {{ecliptic}} {{is divided into}} houses and the ascendant (eastern horizon) marks the cusp, or beginning, of the first house, and the descendant (western horizon) marks the cusp of the seventh house. Many systems, called quadrant house systems, also use the midheaven (medium <b>coeli)</b> as the cusp of the tenth house.|$|E
5000|$|Julius Excluded from Heaven (Iulius exclusus e <b>coelis)</b> is a {{dialogue}} {{that was written}} in 1514, commonly attributed to the Dutch humanist and theologian Desiderius Erasmus. It involves Pope Julius II, who had recently died, trying to persuade Saint Peter {{to allow him to}} enter Heaven by using the same tactics he applied when alive. The dialogue is also supplemented by a [...] "Genius" [...] (his guardian angel) who makes wry comments about the pope and his deeds.|$|R
2500|$|Besides the Brobergens and Haseldorfs further noble {{families}} from the Elbe–Weser triangle (Bremian ministerialis {{such as the}} [...] ) bestowed land and dues on the convent. The Cistercian nuns elected a male provost as their legal warden {{as well as their}} representative at the diets of the prince-archbishopric. The provost and the convent's prioress stewarded its possessions together. Until the secularisation Porta <b>Coeli's</b> provosts were usually simultaneously capitular canons residing in Bremen city. This was because any candidate for provostship had to be confirmed in advance by the Bremen Cathedral Chapter.|$|R
5000|$|The Missa Scala Aretina [...] is {{a typical}} baroque piece, {{sounding}} reminiscent of Biber's Missa Salisburgensis but also looking back to Italian Colossal Baroque music. The Kyrie is sumptuous but diatonic with strong trumpet lines. Aching suspensions are not long in arriving however when the text requires them, such as the mysterious et incarnatus. Like Biber's mass the Credo is highly coloured, with descendit being a descending scale and <b>coelis</b> ascending. The Crucifixus begins in D-major but sinks a tone to a C-minor tierce de Picardie cadence. This is answered by an A-major resurrexit.|$|R
