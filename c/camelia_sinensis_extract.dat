Concentration of 1 mg mL - 1 of semi fermented tea extract was completely biofilm inhibitor but biofilm formation by these bacteria was seen 7 days after treatment with 1 mg mL - 1 of non fermented Camellia sinensis on glass beads and BIC for oral streptococci treated with this extract was 1. 5, 2. 5 mg mL - 1 of semi fermented and 3 mg mL - 1 of non fermented extracts had bactericidal effect on these bacteria. Semi fermented and non fermented Camellia <b>sinensis</b> <b>extracts</b> were able to prevent growth of oral streptococci. Therefore dental caries significantly reduce and the efficiency of semi fermented tea was higher due to rich content of volatile components rather than non fermented extracts...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{condition}} of the liver histology in mice given the green tea MSG induced and analyze the potential of green tea (<b>Camelia</b> <b>sinensis</b> L.) in improving liver function in mice induced MSG. The study was conducted for 30 days with test animals such as male mice strain Balb/c. This study used a completely randomized design factorial. Each treatment consisted of P 0 as controls who were given distilled water 0. 5 ml/bb/day, which were given green tea P 1 0. 015 gr/bb/day, given P 2 MSG 0. 84 gr/bb/day, P 3 given MSG 0, 84 gr/bb/day and green tea 0, 015 gr/bb/day. The results showed that the induction dose of MSG 0. 084 gr/bb/day {{have an impact on the}} decrease in liver weight, elevated levels of ALT and hepatocyte diameter. The administration of green tea dosage 0. 015 gr/bb/day in mice MSG induced or without MSG induction can increase liver weight, decreased levels of ALT and hepatocyte diameter. Interaction of MSG and green tea occurs in hepatocytes diameter, so it can be concluded that the administration of green tea dosage 0. 015 gr/bb/day is able to repair damage hepatocytes caused by MSG induction dose of 0. 084 gr/bb/day...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the effects of Toona <b>sinensis</b> Roemor <b>extracts</b> on antioxidative activities, brain {{morphological}} changes and cognitive ability. In an in vitro study, the antioxidant capacities of water <b>extracts</b> from Toona <b>sinensis</b> Roemor leaf (TSL), root (TSR) and bark (TSB) were evaluated by an alpha,alpha-diphenyl-beta-pricryl-hydrazyl radical-scavenging test. The results showed that the scavenging activities of all Toona <b>sinensis</b> Roemor <b>extracts</b> were over 80 % at a concentration of 0 center dot 625 mg/ml. In an in vivo study, 3 -month-old male senescence-accelerated-prone 8 mice were used as the tested subjects and fed four different diets: casein diet or casein diet supplemented with 1 % TSL, TSR or TSB extract for 12 weeks. The results showed that the mice supplemented with Toona <b>sinensis</b> Roemor <b>extracts</b> demonstrated significantly less amyloid beta-protein deposition and lower levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances than the control group. All Toona sinensis Roemor diet groups also showed better active shuttle avoidance responses, and higher superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities, than the control group. It can thus be concluded that supplementation with either TSL, TSR or TSB extract could not only reduce the incidence of ss-amyloid plaques, but also improve learning and memory ability in senescence-accelerated-prone 8 mice. This might be due to the beneficial effects of Toona <b>sinensis</b> Roemor <b>extracts</b> on promoting the antioxidative defence system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background & Aims: Many {{neurodegenerative}} diseases including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson and Huntington {{diseases are}} associated with the deposition proteinaceous aggregates known as amyloid fibrils. Currently, there is no approved therapeutic agent for inhibition of fibrillar assemblies. One important approach in the development of therapeutic agents is the use of herbal extracts. At the present comparative study, the effect of Cinnamomum zeylanicum Nees and Camellia <b>sinensis</b> L, <b>extracts</b> on prevention of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) amyloidogenesis were studied. Methods: In this experimental study, acidic pH and high temperature were used to drive the protein towards amyloid formation. Lysozyme was dissolved at 2 mg/mL in 50 mM glycine buffer (pH 2. 5), and then incubated at 57 ?C for a specified time while stirred gently by Teflon magnetic bars. Measurement of thioflavin T fluorescence intensity and AFM micrography were used to characterize the HEWL fibrillation processes. Data were analyzed through SPSS 16 using descriptive statistics as well as independent t-test. Results: In the absence of the extracts, soluble oligomers became evident after 24 h of incubation, followed by subsequent appearance of mature fibrils after 48 h. Upon incubation with various concentrations of Cinnamomum zeylanicum and Camellia <b>sinensis</b> <b>extracts</b> in range of 0. 1 - 1 mg/ml, formation of fibrillar assemblies were dose-dependently inhibited but the extract of Camellia was more efficient (P= 0. 025). Also, in contrast to Cinnamomum, Camellia extract can stabilize native protein and reverse partial unfolded form into native form and thus, can inhibit all of amyloid formation pathways. Conclusion: The obtained results suggest that poly phenols of the extracts directly insert into amyloidogenic core of early aggregates and inhibit amyloid fibril formation but Camellia extract, due to its specific chemical structure, is probably more effective for aggregation inhibition.

40|$|Introduction: Electromagnetic fields produce free {{radicals}} {{which might be}} teratogen. Camellia sinensis is rich in natural antioxidants and antioxidants can neutralize {{free radicals}} effects. In present research the effect of C. <b>sinensis</b> <b>extract</b> in reduction of teratogenicity induced by electromagnetic field with 50 gauss intensity was studied on bone marrow of Balb/C mice fetuses. Methods: In this experimental study, 24 Balb/C pregnant mice were randomly divided into four groups: control, sham exposed (off position), experimental 1 (electromagnetic field with 50 -gauss intensity) and experimental 2 (treatment by C. <b>sinensis</b> <b>extract</b> + electromagnetic field with 50 -gauss intensity). After treatment period, the bone marrow aspirates of Balb/C mice embryos were prepared and studied by Giemsa. The quantitative data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Kolmogorov- Smirnov using SPSS 16 software {{at the level of}} p< 0. 05. Results: The mean number of promyelocytes, myelocytes, erythrocytes, necrotic and apoptotic cells in experimental group 1 compared with sham exposed embryos showed significant increase but the mean number of eosinophils in experimental group 1 compared with sham exposed embryos showed significant decrease. The mean number of promyelocyte and erythrocyte in experimental group 2 compared with experimental group 1 showed significant decrease. The mean of necrotic and apoptotic cells, in experimental group 2 compared with experimental group 1 showed significant increase. Conclusion: Usage of C. sinensis can decrease the damage due to teratogenicity induced by low frequency electromagnetic field in some cells. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: In recent years, drug {{resistance}} to human pathogenic fungi has been increased. Medicinal plants are {{one way to}} overcome antibiotic resistance. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the antifungal and inhibitory activity of five medicinal plants on the growth of Candida albicans. Methods: This study was done in the Microbiology Lab of Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Iran in 2015. Five medicinal plants include: Trachyspermum ammi (seed), Teucrium polium (leaf), Piper nigrum (seed), Pistachia vera (skin), <b>Camelia</b> <b>sinensis</b> (leaf) were collected. Collected plant materials were extracted by ethanol and methanol solvent with maceration method. Antifungal activity of the ethanolic and methanolic extracts was evaluated by paper disc diffusion and agar well diffusion methods. Besides, MIC and MBC of each extract was determined. Results: All plant extracts had sufficient inhibitory effect against C. albicans but the extracts of P. vera had the best inhibitory effect on C. albicans (ZOI: 40 mm). The lowest antifungal effect between these five plants related to Piper nigrum (ZOI: 13 mm). Besides, the P. vera extracts had the best MIC and MBC values (6. 25 and 12. 5 mg/ml). Conclusion: This study strongly evidence the maximum antimicrobial activity of medicinal plants against C. albicans that this inhibitory effect varies with the different solvent-extract form. A more comprehensive study need to identify the effective compounds that have these antifungal properties. ...|$|R

Adult male albino rats (n 50) were separated into five groups of ten each, as follows: control group; CCl 4 group; CCl 4 +HP extract group; CCl 4 +UD extract group; CCl 4 +CS extract group. All extract groups were fed with 200 mg kg - 1 extracts of HP, CS and UD, respectively once every alternate day for 7 weeks. CCl 4 injections were applied to the CCl 4 and extract groups at the dose of 0. 4 mL kg - 1. Malondialdehyde, total oxidant status and total antioxidative capacity levels and catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities were significantly changed in the CCl 4 group and indicated increased oxidative stress. The DNA damages detected via commet assay {{were significantly higher than}} in the CCl 4 group. Treatment by extracts of HP, CS or UD were significantly decreased this oxidative stress and ameliorated lymphocyte DNA damage. These results indicate that the herbal extracts of HP, UC and CS have beneficial effects on liver and lymphocyte DNA damage induced by CCl 4 probably due to their antioxidant properties...|$|R
