40|$|Ground based {{radar systems}} are a {{critical}} resource to the command, control and communications system. This thesis provides {{the tools and}} methods {{to better understand the}} actual performance of an operational ground based radar system. This thesis defines two measurable performance standards: (1) the baseline performance, which is based on the sensor's internal characteristics and (2) the theoretical performance, which considers not only the sensor's internal characteristics, but also the effects of the surrounding terrain and atmosphere on the sensor's performance. The baseline radar system performance, often used by operators, contractors, and radar modeling software to determine the expected system performance, is a simplistic and unrealistic means to predict actual radar system performance. The theoretical radar system performance is more complex; but, the results are much more indicative of the actual performance of an operational radar system. The AN/UPS- 1 at the Naval Postgraduate School was used as the system under test to illustrate the baseline and theoretical radar system performance. The terrain effects are shown by performing a multipath study and producing <b>coverage</b> <b>diagrams.</b> The key variables used to construct the multipath study and <b>coverage</b> <b>diagrams</b> are discussed in detail. The atmospheric effects are illustrated by using the Integrated Refractive Effects Prediction System (IREPS) and the Engineer's Refractive Effects Prediction System (EREPS) software tools to produce Propagations Conditions Summaries and Coverage Displays[URL] Air Force (U.

Extremely poor condition of access roads reduces the efficiency of giving new wireless subscriber connections.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, {{considerable}} {{efforts have been}} made {{to assess the impact of}} theenvironment on EM and EO propagation. While encouraging progress has been made in the EM domain, few, if any, operational tools are available for the EO domain. As a consequence, no EO operational software, equivalent to AREPS, TERPEM or PREDEM, is currently in use within the French Forces. The MIRANDA project aims at providing a first version of such an operational EO-tool for the French Navy. The project is headed by SHOM and utilizes core modules of the (scientific) EOSTAR sensor performance tool developed by TNO, in co-operation with the EO-propagation branch of SPAWAR. EOSTAR provides a toolbox with modules to evaluate the main atmospheric processes, such as transmission, refraction and turbulence. Background and signature models allow generation of a scenario of interest and calculation of the thermal radiance properties of the scene elements. A sensor module, eventually including signal processing algorithms, generates the synthetic image as seen by an operator. Propagation factors and detection probabilities can also be presented as <b>coverage</b> <b>diagrams</b> for surveillance and vulnerability studies.

40|$|Fourth {{generation}} (4 G) {{wireless communication}} systems {{are intended to}} support high data rates which requires careful and accurate modelling of the radio environment. In this thesis, {{for the first time}} finite clement based accurate and computationally efficient models of wave propagation in different outdoor and indoor environments has been developed. Three different environments were considered: the troposphere, vegetation and tunnels and wave propagation in these environments were modelled using finite element analysis. Use of finite elements in wave propagation modelling is a novel idea although many propagation models and approaches were used in past. <b>Coverage</b> <b>diagrams,</b> path loss contours and power levels were calculated using developed models in the troposphere, vegetation and tunnels. Results obtained were compared with commercially available software Advanced Refractive Effects Prediction Software (AREPS) to validate the accuracy of the developed approach and it is shown that results were accurate with an accuracy of 3 dB. The developed models were very flexible in handling complex geometries and similar analysis can be easily extended to other environments. A fully vectored finite element base propagation model was developed for straight and curved tunnels. An optimum range of values of different electrical parameters for tunnels of different shapes has been derived. The thesis delivered a novel approach to modelling radio channels that provided a fast and accurate solution of radio wave propagation in realistic environments. The results of this thesis will have a great impact in modelling and characterisation of future wireless communication systems...|$|R

40|$|The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a {{standard}} notation used to model user's requirements for object oriented software systems. With the growing adoption of UML by software developers and researchers, studies have begun to investigate {{how it can be}} used to conduct testing. Several approaches of UML-based software testing have been proposed where test cases are derived from UML diagrams based on efficient algorithms. However, these approaches still suffer from three major limitations namely; inadequate test <b>coverage</b> criteria, insufficient <b>diagrams</b> <b>coverages</b> and incompatibility with various UML tools. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved approach for generating test cases from various UML diagrams based on full coverage criteria. To achieve this aim, a robust method for extracting artefacts from the underlying diagrams of the software under test (SUT) was developed, where the artefacts are represented in an intermediate form using a tree and test cases are generated by traversing the contents of the tree. The proposed approach is fully automated and the generated test cases satisfied the criteria defined for the generation process. The novelty of this approach is its systematic rather than ad hoc test case generation from UML diagrams to achieve high test coverag...|$|R
