5|$|An {{affluent}} 19th-century agricultural <b>community</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{same name}} established near the lakeside in the mid-19th century, but dwindled in status, becoming virtually {{abandoned in the}} aftermath of the American Civil War. It was strategically important during the early stages of the war, due to its proximity to fresh water and the Gulf of Mexico. After reaching its low point during the Great Depression, the lakeside community modestly rebounded in 1947 following the nearby discovery of oil. A fictional lake of the same name and with a similar history is featured in the 1998 novel Holes.|$|E

The Bene Israeli Jewish community of Bombay, who migrated from the Konkan villages, south of Bombay, are believed to be the descendants of the Jews of Israel who were shipwrecked off the Konkan coast, probably in the year 175 BCE, during the reign of the Greek ruler, Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Mumbai is also home to the largest population of Parsi Zoroastrians in the world, numbering about 60,000 though with a sharply declining population. Parsis migrated to India from Pars (Persia/Iran) following the Muslim conquest of Persia in the seventh century. The oldest Muslim communities in Mumbai include the Dawoodi Bohras, Ismaili Khojas, and Konkani Muslims.|$|E

5|$|The civitas (tribal <b>community)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Helvetii {{was similar}} to that of the Celtic tribes of the Valais, which were merged into a single civitas Vallensis {{probably}} around 40AD, and given Forum Claudii Vallensium (Martigny) as their capital. Parts of the modern Ticino belonged to the colony of Comum (Como), founded in the 1st century AD. On the local level, the basic administrative units were the vici, replacing the Helvetic pagi, or tribes, which were dissolved at the time of colonization. These villages enjoyed a certain autonomy and were governed by popularly elected magistrates (magistri or curatores).|$|E
5|$|The diverse ethno-linguistic {{groups of}} Tripura have {{given rise to}} a {{composite}} culture.

Bengali people represent the largest ethno-linguist <b>community</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state. Bengali culture, as a result, is the main indigenous, non-Tripura culture. Indeed, many elite tribal families which reside in towns have actively embraced Bengali culture and language in the past, but in today's generation more Tripuris are embracing their culture. The Tripuri kings were great patrons of Bengali culture, especially literature; Bengali language was the language of the court. Elements of Bengali culture, such as Bengali literature, Bengali music, and Bengali cuisine are widespread, particularly in the urban areas of the state.|$|E
