25|$|In {{depression}} and grief syndromes, crying is typically {{a sign of}} sadness, whereas the pathological displays of crying which occur in PBA are often {{in contrast to the}} underlying mood, or greatly in excess of the mood or eliciting stimulus. In addition, a key to differentiating depression from PBA is duration: PBA episodes are sudden, occurring in a brief episodic manner, while <b>crying</b> <b>in</b> depression is a more sustained presentation and closely relates to the underlying mood state. The level of control that one has over the crying episodes in PBA is minimal or nonexistent, whereas for those suffering from depression, the emotional expression (typically crying) can be modulated by the situation. Similarly, the trigger for episodes of <b>crying</b> <b>in</b> patients with PBA may be nonspecific, minimal or inappropriate to the situation, but in depression the stimulus is specific to the mood-related condition. These differences are outlined in the adjacent Table.|$|E
