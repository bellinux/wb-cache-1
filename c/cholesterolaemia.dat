40|$|The {{biochemical}} {{effects of}} administration of embelin a benzoquinone derivative from Embelia ribes and curcumin (diferuloyl methane) isolated from Curcuma longa against a 2 step hepatocarcinogenic regimen comprising of N-nitrosodiethylamine (DENA) /phenobarbital (PB) was studied in wistar strain male albino rats {{with respect to}} lipid profile, renal function tests and levels of blood glucose. Rats administered DENA/PB showed hyper <b>cholesterolaemia,</b> hyper triglyceridaemia, elevated low-density lipoproteins (LDL), free fatty acids (FFA), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) levels and decreased urea levels. Pre- and co-treatment with embelin and curcumin for 14 weeks significantly prevented the biochemical alterations induced by DENA/PB.

40|$|Statins, {{the most}} popular lipid-lowering agents, have proven their {{efficacy}} in preventing cardiovascular events in subjects with lower and lower initial plasma cholesterol levels. Besides, the protective effect {{does not seem to}} be directly related neither to the degree of the cholesterol reduction nor to the final level of plasma cholesterol level reached under treatment. Such observations suggest that statins may exert vascular protective effects, at least in part, independently of their specific cholesterol-lowering effect (so-called pleiotropic effects). The present paper will discuss the arguments pro and contra the dosage of <b>cholesterolaemia</b> before initiating a therapy with statin and during treatment follow up, both in subjects with previous cardiovascular events (secondary prevention) and in subjects with a high cardiovascular absolute risk but without previous clinical expression of atherosclerosis (primary prevention).

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of three fibres (sugar-beet fibre, guar gum and inulin) incorporated in the basal diet of healthy dogs at 7 per cent of dry matter (DM). Parameters examined included stool output, water consumption, nutrient digestibility and fasting and postprandial plasma metabolites. All fibres increased wet faecal output; an increase in faecal DM output being observed with sugar-beet fibre only. Sugar-beet fibre and inulin increased daily water consumption. Sugar-beet fibre and guar gum decreased DM digestibility. The three fibres diminished organic matter and crude protein digestibility while ether extract digestibility was decreased by guar gum and inulin. Guar gum induced lower postprandial insulin, alpha-amino-nitrogen and urea plasma concentrations. Guar gum also lowered fasting <b>cholesterolaemia.</b> Sugar-beet fibre and inulin showed no metabolic effects. These physiological properties suggest that guar gum would be a suitable ingredient for dietary therapy of chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus or hyperlipidaemia in the dog.

In study 1, 27 outpatients with hypercholesterolaemia (16 statin-naïve, 11 switched from another statin) took atorvastatin (10 mg once daily) for 3 months. After 3 months, low-density lipo-protein cholesterol (LDL-C) had decreased significantly in both groups, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and estimated glomerular filtration rate had increased only in the statin-naïve group, and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c) had not changed significantly in either group. Study 2 was a retrospective investigation of 87 outpatients with hyper <b>cholesterolaemia</b> who had been taking atorvastatin for at least 4 years.

40|$|Introduction: Vitamin A {{deficiency}} {{can result}} from malnutrition, malabsorption of vitamin A, impaired vitamin metabolism associated with liver disease, or chronic debilitating diseases like HIV infection or cancer. Background & aims: Cannabis administration {{has been described as}} a palliative symptom management therapy in such pathological stages. Therefore, this research aimed to study the effects of acute administration of cannabidiol (CBD) or thetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on the levels of retinol in plasma and in the liver, and biochemical parameters related to lipid and glucose metabolism (<b>cholesterolaemia,</b> triglyceridemia and glycemia) in a rat experimental model of vitamin A deficiency. Methods: The experimental animal model of Vitamin A deficiency was developed during a 50 -day experimental period in which rats consumed a vitamin A-free diet. Cannabidiol (10 mg/kg body weight) or thetrahydrocannabinol (5 mg/kg body weight) were administered intraperitoneally 2 hours prior to sacrifice of the animals. Results: The nutritional deficiency caused a significant decrease in plasmatic and liver contents of retinol and biochemical parameters of glycemic, lipidic, and mineral metabolism. Acute intraperitoneal administration of Cannabidiol and thetrahydrocannabinol did not improve the indices of vitamin A status in either control or vitamin A-deficient rats. However, it had a significant effect on specific biochemical parameters such as glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol. Conclusion: Under our experimental conditions, the reported effects of cannabinoid administration on certain signs of nutritional vitamin A deficiency appeared to be mediated through mechanisms other than changes in retinol metabolism or its mobilization after the acute administration of such compounds...|$|E
40|$|This work is {{centred on}} the {{presentation}} of a computer-based system for assisted medical diagnosis using Frederickson's (WHO) dislipaemia classification as an example. The algorithm {{is based on a}} decision tree using simple empirical rules to present dislipaemia type from simpler data, such as <b>cholesterolaemia,</b> triglyceridaemia, age, HDL cholesterol, and De Gennes chylomicra test. Output can be Frederickson's type I, IIa, IIb, IV or V discipaemia or suggestion for more tests. The algorithm is presented in pseudo code. It was tested using 645 samples collected during a continuous time span and presenting lipid disorders in a fraction much above the usual (samples received at the Biochemistry Department of the Faculty of Medical Sciences for blood lipid study including lipoprotein electrophoresis, of which 59 % were abnormal). From those 645 samples previously classified by a human expert through electrophoresis, the algorithm suggested more studies for 17 (2, 5 %) samples and there was disagreement among human expert and algorithmic classification regarding 3 (< 0, 5 %) samples. I conclude that the program efficiently replaces the standard method for dislipaemia classification, lipoprotein electrophoresis, in 97 % of the cases presented, with less than 0, 5 % errors.

40|$|The {{effects of}} omega- 3 fatty acids and oily fish on in vivo plasma lipids and oxidant status {{are not well}} defined and understood. The effect of olive oil-fried sardine {{consumption}} on serum and lipoprotein levels and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and on faecal fat, bile and cholesterol excretions was tested in hypercholesterolemic rats. Cholesterol plus bovine bile {{was used as a}} serum cholesterol-raising agent in a casein plus olive oil (COC) diet for 3 weeks. Groups of seven rats were switched for 2 weeks to diets containing casein plus olive oil (CO) and olive oil-fried sardines (S). Seven rats received the CO diet throughout the whole study and served as the control (R). TBARS, cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids were determined in serum and high density lipoproteins (HDL) while fat, bile acid and cholesterol levels were measured in the faeces. Cholesterol withdrawal decreased serum cholesterol and TBARS in S and CO rats (p< 0. 01). The S rats had cholesterol and TBARS values {{similar to those of the}} R rats. The S diet significantly increased the daily fat, bile acid and cholesterol excretions (all, p< 0. 05), while the cholesterol and TBARS contents in serum, HDL and non-HDL (VLDL+LDL) (all, p< 0. 05) decreased with respect to the CO rats. The cholesterol/ phospholipid ratio was lower in serum and HDL of the S rats than in the CO rats (p< 0. 05). These findings show that the inclusion in diets of olive oil-fried sardines as the only source of fat and protein in diets increases faecal cholesterol and bile acid excretions that normalise <b>cholesterolaemia</b> and serum lipid peroxidation.

40|$|Background In {{addition}} to its glucose-lowering effect, metformin treatment has been suggested to improve lipidaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. In contrast, in patients with type 1 diabetes (T 1 DM), information {{about the effect of}} metformin treatment on lipidaemia is limited. In this study, we report the effect of a 1 -year treatment with metformin vs. placebo on plasma lipids in T 1 DM patients and persistent poor glycaemic control. Methods One hundred T 1 DM patients with haemoglobinA(1 c) (HbA(1 c)) >= 8. 5 % during the year before enrolment entered a 1 -month run-in period on placebo treatment. Thereafter, patients were randomized (baseline) to treatment with either metformin (1000 mg twice daily) or placebo for 12 months (double masked). Patients continued ongoing insulin therapy and their usual outpatient clinical care. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and after 1 year. Results After 1 year, in those patients who did not start or stop statin therapy during the trial, metformin treatment significantly reduced total and LDL cholesterol by approximately 0. 3 mmol/l compared with placebo (p = 0. 021 and p = 0. 018 respectively). Adjustment for statin use or known cardiovascular disease did not change conclusions. In statin users (metformin: n = 22, placebo: n = 13), metformin significantly lowered levels of LDL and non-HDL cholesterol by approximately 0. 5 mmol/l compared with placebo (adjusted for changes in statin dose or agent: p = 0. 048 and p = 0. 033 respectively). HbA(1 c) (previously reported) was not significant different between treatments.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) deficiency on gap junctional connexin 36 (Cx 36) islet content and on the functional and growth response of pancreatic beta-cells in C 57 BL/ 6 mice fed a high-fat (HF) diet. After 60 days on regular or HF diet, the metabolic state and morphometric islet parameters of wild-type (WT) and LDLr-/- mice were assessed. HF diet-fed WT animals became obese and hypercholesterolaemic as well as hyperglycaemic, hyperinsulinaemic, glucose intolerant and insulin resistant, characterizing them as prediabetic. Also they showed {{a significant decrease in}} beta-cell secretory response to glucose. Overall, LDLr-/- mice displayed greater susceptibility to HF diet as judged by their marked <b>cholesterolaemia,</b> intolerance to glucose and pronounced decrease in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. HF diet induced similarly in WT and LDLr-/- mice, a significant decrease in Cx 36 beta-cell content as revealed by immunoblotting. Prediabetic WT mice displayed marked increase in beta-cell mass mainly due to beta-cell hypertrophy/replication. Nevertheless, HF diet-fed LDLr-/- mice showed no significant changes in beta-cell mass, but lower islet-duct association (neogenesis) and higher beta-cell apoptosis index were seen as compared to controls. the higher metabolic susceptibility to HF diet of LDLr-/- mice may be explained by a deficiency in insulin secretory response to glucose associated with lack of compensatory beta-cell expansion.

A cross-sectional study was performed in a total of 23 patients with lipodystrophy (LD) : nine patients with fat accumulation, six patients with fat loss, eight patients with combined form, who were compared to 11 individuals infected by HIV without LD (HIV-positive) and 10 seronegative controls (CTRL). PBLs were obtained by standard methods, that is, gradient density centrifugation on Ficoll, and CD 4 or CD 8 cells were positively isolated by magnetic sorting to eliminate the contamination of platelets. mtDNA content was then measured by an original assay based upon real-time PCR. mtDNA content was significantly increased in CD 4 T cells from patients with LD, while no differences were present between CD 4 and CD 8 cells from HIV-positive and CTRL individuals. Nor were any differences found when comparing LD or HIV-positive patients treated with stavudine or zidovudine, or taking D-drugs or non D-drugs. Patients with fat accumulation had significantly higher mtDNA content compared to HIV-positive and CTRL, this phenomenon regarding both CD 4 and CD 8 PBLs. Considering all HIV-positive patients (including LD), mtDNA content showed a significant, positive correlation with <b>cholesterolaemia</b> but not with triglyceridaemia and glycaemia. Relatively high mtDNA content in LD patients, as well as the correlation between mtDNA content and cholesterol in all HIV-positive subjects, suggest the involvement of mitochondria in such a pathology. However, further studies are needed to confirm these initial observations and ascertain whether the quantification of mtDNA in PBL is a useful and reliable marker to investigate and monitor HAART-related changes in fat distribution...|$|E
40|$|The {{nutritional}} consequences of algae consumption in young populations consuming hypercholesterolaemic diets have hardly been investigated. This study tests {{the effect of}} algae supplementation of cholesterol-enriched balanced diets on growth, dietary efficiency ratio, mineral intake and absorption, organ weight and structure and <b>cholesterolaemia</b> in growing Wistar rats. Three groups of ten rats each were fed for 3 weeks with experimental diets containing 93 % casein-soyabean oil base with 2. 4 % cholesterol-raising agent and 7 % supplement. The control group received cellulose (35 %), group 2 consumed Nori (33. 8 % fibre) and group 3 consumed Konbu (36. 1 % fibre). Food intake and body weight gain were not significantly affected. Algae groups presented significantly higher dietary efficiency ratio values than control rats. Apparent absorption of several minerals appeared significantly affected, mainly in Nori-fed rats, with {{a significant decrease in}} the ratio of Zn and Cu intakes and apparent absorption. Nori diet significantly decreased plasma cholesterol. Algae supplement did not significantly affect organ size and structure. Control and Konbu rats showed severe liver fat infiltration, while Nori rats exhibited a significantly lower degree of lipid-like hepatocyte vacuolization but light to moderate leukocyte infiltration. Light to moderate scaling off of the epithelium and moderate submucosa oedema was observed in all groups. Although long-term studies are needed to check the possible extrapolation of these data to human subjects, it can be concluded that a Nori, but not a Konbu, dietary supplement reverses the negative effect of dietary cholesterol intake and also appears to be related to mineral availability in growing subjects. © 2007 The Authors.

40|$|Abstract Background Second {{generation}} antipsychotics (SGA) {{have demonstrated}} several advantages over first generation antipsychotics (FGA) {{in terms of}} positive, negative, cognitive, and affective symptoms and a lower propensity for extrapyramidal side effects. Despite these undeniable advantages, SGA {{have been associated with}} causing and exacerbating metabolic disorders, such as obesity, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. This cross sectional study aimed to evaluate the metabolic risk factor profile associated with use of SGAs in comparison with non -treated control patients. Methods The study was carried out at a Community Mental Health Centre (CMHC) in Bologna. The study subjects were outpatients with serious mental disorders treated with SGA (clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine). A sample of adult men and women suffering from idiopathic hyperhydrosis, without psychiatric history or antipsychotic treatment, were randomly selected from outpatients of the Department of Neurology in Bologna as a reference group. We investigated differences among the treatment and reference groups for glycaemia, <b>cholesterolaemia</b> and triglyceridaemia levels. Results The study sample was composed of 76 patients, 38 males and 38 females. The reference group was composed of 36 subjects, 19 females and 17 males. All patients treated with SGAs had higher mean glycaemia and triglyceridaemia and a significantly higher risk of receiving a diagnosis of hyperglycaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia than the reference group. We did not find any differences in mean glycaemia or mean triglyceridaemia levels among treatment groups. Patients with clozapine had a significantly higher mean BMI value and rate of obesity than patients treated with other SGAs. Conclusion The rate of obesity and metabolic disorders observed in this study were higher than the prevalence in the control group and similar to that previously reported in psychiatric samples; these findings imply per se that more attention should be paid to the metabolic condition of psychiatric patients. In line with the International Consensus Conferences we recommend that monitoring of weight, fasting plasma glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride levels be obtained in routine clinical practice with all antipsychotics. </p...|$|E
40|$|Cholesterol {{esterification}} and accumulation in the {{arterial wall}} is a hallmark of atherogenesis. Several preclinical studies suggest that calcium antagonists may exert antiatherosclerotic activity by directly affecting atherogenesis in the arterial wall. We investigated {{the effect of the}} second generation dihydropyridine calcium antagonist lacidipine on cholesterol metabolism in vivo in the aortic arch of cholesterol fed rabbits, and in vitro in mouse cultured peritoneal macrophages. Treatment of cholesterol-fed rabbits with 1, 3 and 10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 day− 1 of lacidipine for two months reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, cholesterol esterification in the aortic arch: 24 ± 6, 30 ± 12, and 41 ± 8 % inhibition, respectively (P< 0. 001 vs HC control). Concomitantly, drug treatment reduced total cholesterol content of the vessel wall. Lacidipine 3 and 10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 day− 1 reduced <b>cholesterolaemia</b> (∼ 20 %); no effect was observed at the lowest dose used (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 day− 1). These results suggest that the action of lacidipine on cholesterol esterification in the arterial wall involves, at least in part, a direct effect on cellular cholesterol metabolism. Inhibition of cholesterol esterification in the arterial wall was observed also in a reference group of animals treated with the specific ACAT inhibitor CI- 976. To evaluate the action of lacidipine on intracellular cholesterol metabolism we performed in vitro experiments with murine macrophages, the main cell type that accumulates cholesterol in the arterial wall. Lacidipine almost completely inhibited cholesterol esterification in cholesterol loaded macrophages in culture. The effect was observed independently of esterification stimuli and in cell free homogenates. The drug modified intracellular cholesterol distribution, doubling the free- to esterified sterol ratio, but did not influence the cellular rate of cholesteryl ester hydrolysis in the cell. All together these results indicate an inhibitory effect of lacidipine on cholesterol esterification catalyzed by the enzyme ACAT in murine macrophages. We concluded that lacidipine influences cellular cholesterol metabolism. This effect may contribute to the potential antiatherosclerotic activity of this drug...|$|E
40|$|Sinigrin (SIN) and {{allyl isothiocyanate}} (AITC) are {{compounds}} found in high concentrations in Brassica family vegetables, especially in Brussels sprouts. Recently, {{they have been}} used as a nutrition supplement for their preventive and medicinal effect on some types of cancer and other diseases. In this research, nutritional significance of parent glucosinolate sinigrin 50  μmol/kg b. w. /day and its degradation product allyl isothiocyanate 25  μmol/kg b. w. /day and 50  μmol/kg b. w. /day was studied by the evaluation of their influence on some parameters of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in an animal rat model in vivo after their single (4  h) and 2  weeks oral administration. Additionally, the aim of this trial was to evaluate the direct action of AITC on basal and epinephrine-induced lipolysis in isolated rat adipocytes at concentration 1  μM, 10  μM and 100  μM in vitro. Sole AITC after 4  h of its ingestion caused liver triacylglycerols increment at both doses and glycaemia only at the higher dose. Multiple SIN treatment showed its putative bioconversion into AITC. It was found that SIN and AITC multiple administration in the same way strongly disturbed lipid and carbohydrate homeostasis, increasing esterified and total cholesterol, free fatty acids and lowering tracylglycerols in the blood serum. Additionally, AITC at both doses elevated insulinaemia and liver glycogen enhancement. The in vitro experiment revealed that AITC potentiated basal lipolysis process at 10  μM, and had stimulatory effect on epinephrine action at 1  μM and 10  μM. The results of this study demonstrated that the effect of SIN and AITC is multidirectional, indicating its impact on many organs like liver as well as pancreas, intestine in vivo action and rat adipocytes in vitro. Whilst consumption of cruciferous vegetables at levels currently considered “normal” seems to be beneficial to human health, this data suggest that any large increase in intake could conceivably lead to undesirable effect. This effect is potentiated with time of action of the examined compounds, whose influence is rather adverse for the majority of metabolic pathways (liver steatosis at short duration and insulinaemia, <b>cholesterolaemia</b> at long time treatment). Beneficial action of AITC concerned intensified hydrolysis of TG in the blood serum with a simultaneous lipolysis in adipocytes...|$|E
40|$|Inulin is {{a generic}} term {{to cover all}} beta(2 [...] > 1) linear fructans. Chicory inulin is a linear beta(2 [...] > 1) fructan (degree of {{polymerisation}} (DP) 2 to 60; DPav= 12), its partial enzymatic hydrolysis product is oligofructose (DP 2 to 8; DPav= 4), and by applying specific separation technologies a long-chain inulin known as inulin HP (DP 10 to 60; DPav= 25) can be produced. Finally, a specific product known as oligofructose-enriched inulin is obtained by combining chicory long-chain inulin and oligofructose. Because of the beta-configuration of the anomeric C 2 in their fructose monomers, inulin-type fructans resist hydrolysis by intestinal digestive enzymes, they classify as 'non-digestible' carbohydrates, and they are dietary fibres. By increasing faecal biomass and water content of the stools, they improve bowel habits, but they have characteristic features different from other fibres. They affect gastrointestinal functions not because of their physico-chemical properties but rather because of their biochemical and physiological attributes. In the colon, they are rapidly fermented to produce SCFA that are good candidates to {{explain some of the}} systemic effects of inulin-type fructans. Fermentation of inulin-type fructans in the large bowel is a selective process; bifidobacteria (and possibly a few other genera) are preferentially stimulated to grow, thus causing significant changes in the composition of the gut microflora by increasing the number of potentially health-promoting bacteria and reducing the number of potentially harmful species. Both oligofructose and inulin are prebiotic. They also induce changes in colonic epithelium stimulating proliferation in the crypts, increasing the concentration of polyamines, changing the profile of mucins, and modulating endocrine as well as immune functions. From a nutrition labelling perspective, inulin-type fructans are not only prebiotic dietary fibres; they are also low-calorie carbohydrates [6. 3 kJ/g (1. 5 kcal/g) ]. Supported by the results {{of a large number of}} animal studies and human nutrition intervention trials, the claim 'inulin-type fructans enhance calcium and magnesium absorption' is scientifically substantiated, but different inulin-type fructans have probably a different efficacy (in terms of effective daily dose), the most active product being the oligofructose-enriched inulin. A series of animal studies demonstrate that inulin-type fructans affect the metabolism of lipids primarily by decreasing triglyceridaemia because of a reduction in the number of plasma VLDL particles. The human data largely confirm the animal experiments. They demonstrate mainly a reduction in triglyceridaemia and only a relatively slight decrease in <b>cholesterolaemia</b> mostly in (slightly) hypertriglyceridaemic conditions. Inulin appears thus eligible for an enhanced function claim related to normalization of blood triacylglycerols. A large number of animal data convincingly show that inulin-type fructans reduce the risk of colon carcinogenesis and nutrition intervention trials are now performed to test that hypothesis in human subjects known to be at risk for polyps and cancer development in the large bowel...|$|E
