It was more important for freight traffic, as there were four sidings serving the local industry, three of which remained in operation until shortly before the closing of the line. Main customers were the agricultural <b>co-operative</b> <b>warehouse</b> and the textile industry. The following buildings existed: a station building with two and a half stories (Saxon standard design, built in brick), a goods shed, a non-residential and a residential building and a loading dock.

40|$|Background Several indices {{exist to}} {{describe}} the objective health and also to asses subjective health. The association between comorbidity, severity and subjective health with health expenditure is demonstrated, however {{it is not clear}} which of these aspects is more influent. We evaluated the role of comorbidity, severity of disease and subjective health to predict health costs in a non-hospitalized population. Methods In 2009 / 10 the questionnaire SF 36 (8 scales: physical functioning-PF, physical role-PR, pain-PN, general health- GH, vitality-VT, social functions-SF, emotional role-ER, mental health-MH) and two summary scales (Physical-PCS and Mental-MCS) was distributed to 887 patients of general practitioners (GP) in Siena’s province, Tuscany-Italy. GPs calculate Charlson Index (CI) and Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) for each patient. CI is an index summing diseases’ associated weights and adding one point for each decade after 40 years. CIRS produces a severity score as the mean weight of severity of coexisting illnesses. Information about gender, age, marital status, employment, BMI and smoking habits were collected. Data about pharmaceutical, diagnostic tests, specialistic visits and hospital admissions costs regarding each patient were obtained from Local Health Unit’ data <b>warehouse.</b> <b>Association</b> between SF 36 scales, PCS, MCS, CI and CIRS with expenditure variables was studied using multivariate nonparametric quantile regression, adjusting for above confounders. Results Mean age 57, 4, 63. 5 % females. At multivariate analysis resulted associated with diagnostic examination costs: CI (coeff. = 31. 36, p < 0. 001), CIRS (297. 51, p < 0. 001), PCS (- 4, p < 0. 001), PR (- 0. 53, p < 0. 05), PN (- 1, p = 0. 001), GH (- 1, 5, p = 0. 002); with pharmaceutical cost: CI (47. 47, p < 0. 001) SI (470, p < 0. 001) PCS (- 2. 13, p < 0. 05) PA (- 0. 75, p < 0. 05) GH (- 1. 79 p < 0. 001) VT (- 0. 082 p < 0. 02). None of the health measures was associated with hospital admission expenditure. Conclusions Objective measures of health are strongly correlated with tested expenditures. Subjective measures are also correlated, although less of objective ones. Severity of disease is more correlated with health expenditures than comorbidity. Mental/psycholo- gical domains of subjective health have no effect on health expenditures. Key message The objective measures of health are a strong predictor of health expenditures Health expenditure is influenced not only by the objective state of health but also from a subjective...|$|R

40|$|Healthcare institutes {{enrich the}} {{repository}} of patients' disease related information in an increasing manner {{which could have}} been more useful by carrying out relational analysis. Data mining algorithms are proven to be quite useful in exploring useful correlations from larger data repositories. In this paper we have implemented Association Rules mining based a novel idea for finding co-occurrences of diseases carried by a patient using the healthcare repository. We have developed a system-prototype for Clinical State Correlation Prediction (CSCP) which extracts data from patients' healthcare database, transforms the OLTP data into a Data <b>Warehouse</b> by generating <b>association</b> rules. The CSCP system helps reveal relations among the diseases. The CSCP system predicts the correlation(s) among primary disease (the disease for which the patient visits the doctor) and secondary disease/s (which is/are other associated disease/s carried by the same patient having the primary disease).

Regardless the management practices; the increased susceptibility that the non-ARR alleles confer on an individual could be extrapolated at the population level. Increasing prevalence of ARR allele reduces the overall risk of scrapie at population level. At genotype level, the VRQ/VRQ genotype, present a very low frequency in the study population, seems to play a residual effect in the overall risk of scrapie in a flock. </p...|$|R
