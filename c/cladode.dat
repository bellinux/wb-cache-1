40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the levels of macronutrients in <b>cladodes</b> and yield of cactus pear, cv. ‘Gigante’, cultivated with different cattle manure doses and plant spacings. The experimental design was randomized blocks in 4 x 3 factorial, with three replicates. The treatments consisted of the combination of four doses of cattle manure (0, 30, 60 and 90 Mg ha- 1 year- 1) with three spacings (1. 00 x 0. 50, 2. 00 x 0. 25 and 3. 00 x 1. 00 x 0. 25 m). The contents of macronutrients and dry matter production of <b>cladodes</b> were assessed 600 days after planting. The plant spacings influenced the contents of nitrogen, potassium, calcium and sulfur in the <b>cladodes</b> of ‘Gigante’ cactus pear and there was interaction between spacing and manure dose for magnesium contents. The increment in cattle manure doses increases the contents of phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium and sulfur in the <b>cladodes.</b> The maximum dry matter production of <b>cladodes</b> is estimated at 21. 8 Mg ha- 1 year- 1 at a dose of 71. 8 Mg ha- 1 year- 1 of manure...|$|R
40|$|The organ-specific accumulation, spatial distribution, and {{chemical}} speciation of selenium (Se) were previously unknown for any species of cactus. We investigated Se in Opuntia ficus-indica using {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry, microfocused x-ray fluorescence elemental {{and chemical}} mapping ({micro}XRF), Se K-edge x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). {micro}XRF showed Se concentrated inside small conic, vestigial leaves (<b>cladode</b> tips), the <b>cladode</b> vasculature, and the seed embryos. Se K-edge XANES demonstrated that approximately 96 % of total Se in <b>cladode,</b> fruit juice, fruit pulp, and seed is carbon-Se-carbon (C-Se-C). Micro and bulk XANES analysis showed that <b>cladode</b> tips contained both selenate and C-Se-C forms. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry quantification of Se in high-performance liquid chromatography fractions followed by LC-MS structural identification showed selenocystathionine-to-selenomethionine (SeMet) ratios of 75 : 25, 71 : 29, and 32 : 68, respectively in <b>cladode,</b> fruit, and seed. Enzymatic digestions and subsequent analysis confirmed that Se was mainly present in a 'free' nonproteinaceous form inside <b>cladode</b> and fruit, while in the seed, Se was incorporated into proteins associated with lipids. {micro}XRF chemical mapping illuminated the specific location of Se reduction and assimilation from selenate accumulated in the <b>cladode</b> tips into the two LC-MS-identified C-Se-C forms before they were transported into the <b>cladode</b> mesophyll. We conclude that Opuntia is a secondary Se-accumulating plant whose fruit and <b>cladode</b> contain mostly free selenocystathionine and SeMet, while seeds contain mainly SeMet in protein.

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if age, water availability and temperature influence diel <b>cladode</b> shrinkage and enlargement dynamics in cactus pear. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse from April to July 2014, using cactus pear plants, equally split into irrigated and unirrigated treatments, and unrooted cladodes detached from mother plants. Soil moisture content (SMC), soil water depletion over 24 -h, <b>cladode</b> relative water content (RWC), <b>cladode</b> thickness, stomatal conductance (gs), <b>cladode</b> growth rates (area increase) and nocturnal malic acid accumulation were monitored in plants of various ages. <b>Cladode</b> shrinkage and enlargement dynamics were assessed using stem gauges and expressed as absolute growth rate (AGRthickness, μmmin- 1). In unirrigated pots, drought decreased SMC, RWC,cladode thickness, <b>cladode</b> growth rate and gs. Younger cladodes lost water later than older ones. Detached cladodes exhibited gs activity 3 - 4 months after detachment. Trends of AGRthickness showed that there was a progressive reduction of diel swelling and shrinkage fluctuations as cladodes aged. Such fluctuations were minimized under severe drought when 1 -year-old cladodes reached 8 mm thickness and a RWC of about 45 %. A positive correlation was found between SMC and AGRthickness. Temperatures were also directly correlated with AGRthickness, although this relationship was gradually lost as SMC decreased.

Preliminarily, the antioxidant activity was determined through in vitro assays. Further, it was confirmed through ex vivo analysis on intestinal Caco- 2 /TC 7 cells, and the profile of flavonoids was characterized. Cactus <b>cladode</b> pulp was fermented with lactic acid bacteria, which were previously selected from plant materials.

40|$|Introduction. Opuntia ficus-indica fruit {{quality was}} studied, {{in the main}} sites for cactus pear {{cultivation}} in Italy, with {{the ultimate goal of}} understanding the main sources of variability and increasing crop value. Materials and methods. A first study was carried out in 2006 on mature Opuntia ficus-indica trees, cvs. Gialla and Rossa, grown in ten commercial orchards located in the main sites for their cultivation in Italy. Trees were managed to produce an out-of-season crop in October, through the removal of the spring flush at bloom time, {{during the first week of}} June. Trees had a similar crop [(52 ± 10) kg of fruits•tree- 1], and no more than six fruits were left on each of the fruiting cladodes. At commercial harvest time, indicated by the peel colour breakage, 75 fruits in each orchard and 750 fruits for each site were picked, analysed and evaluated by a consumer panel. A second experiment was carried out in 2006 on 8 -year-old O. ficus-indica trees, cv. Gialla, grown in a commercial orchard. Within-tree factors, such as fruit position within the canopy, number of fruits per tree and per <b>cladode,</b> and <b>cladode</b> dry weight were studied. Results and discussion. Fruit weight, shape and total soluble solid content significantly changed with the environmental conditions, i. e., site and altitude, while flesh percent, pH and total titratable acidity did not. Cultivars had a significant influence only on fruit weight and seed content. Fruit weight changed greatly within the tree, while total soluble solid content and flesh percent variability was much reduced. Fruit weight decreased with fruit number per tree and both fruit weight and total soluble solid content decreased with more than six fruits per <b>cladode.</b> Light interception and <b>cladode</b> dry weight were the main sources of fruit dry weight variability and sugar content, while <b>cladode</b> surface area was poorly related to fruit quality. The role of cultivars in determining fruit quality did not change with site and, moreover, the sensory analysis was unable to discriminate for cultivar and environment...|$|E
