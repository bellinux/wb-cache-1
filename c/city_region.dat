5|$|Soil {{cover in}} the <b>city</b> <b>region</b> is {{predominantly}} sandy due to its proximity to the sea. In the suburbs, the soil cover is largely alluvial and loamy.

Mumbai sits on a seismically active zone owing to the presence of 23 fault lines in the vicinity. The area is classified as a Seismic Zone III region, which means an earthquake of up to magnitude 6.5 on the Richter magnitude scale may be expected.|$|E
5|$|St James' Church, {{commonly}} known as St James', King Street, is an Anglican parish church in inner city Sydney, Australia, consecrated in February 1824 and named in honour of St James the Great. It became a parish church in 1835. Designed {{in the style of}} a Georgian town church by the transported convict architect Francis Greenway during the governorship of Lachlan Macquarie, St James' is part of the historical precinct of Macquarie Street which includes other early colonial era buildings such as the Hyde Park Barracks. The church remains historically, socially and architecturally significant. The building is the oldest one extant in Sydney's inner <b>city</b> <b>region.</b> It is listed on the Register of the National Estate, and has been described as one of the world's 80 greatest man-made treasures.|$|E

Florida's original study focused only on <b>city</b> <b>regions</b> with more than 100, 000 inhabitants.

The findings are clearly less supportive for these smaller regions, which mean that the original creative class approach has to be considerably refined when used in the Nordic context.

Presently, second-tier <b>city</b> <b>regions</b> are not capable of offering all these factors simultaneously. For improving their opportunities and contribution to European cohesion and convergence, more substantial and direct investments are needed.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} census-derived commuting {{data for}} the world’s earliest major urbanindustrial region, now home to 10 million people. Owing its origins to water power from the Pennine rivers, this region now comprises many closely-spaced cities and towns whose distinct identities have been eroded through {{the loss of their}} local industrial specialisms and the long-term growth in mobility. It contains five of the <b>city</b> <b>regions</b> identified by ‘The Northern Way’, a policy initiative designed as part of the Labour government’s 2004 Sustainable Cities Plan for stimulating agglomeration economies across the wider region, with a more polycentric structure being seen as a positive contribution to this development. The paper tests how far this part of Northern England may be evolving into a single polycentric mega-city region, using commuting data from the 1981, 1991 and 2001 Censuses. Two hypotheses are tested; namely, that there is increasing polycentricity within each of the five <b>city</b> <b>regions</b> and that there is increasing linkage between the five <b>city</b> <b>regions.</b> With gravity modelling removing the effects of generic reductions in distance deterrence, evidence is found of trends towards greater polycentricity at both these scales of analysis, albeit modest in scale: there has been some reduction in the five cities’ attraction of commuters living in the other parts of their <b>city</b> <b>regions</b> and the boundaries between the <b>city</b> <b>regions</b> have become somewhat more permeable over time...|$|R

The enlargement of the EU or the introduction of the euro, however, can be looked upon as natural experiments that shed light on the consequences of changes in distance over time. Central in this paper is the notion that border <b>cities</b> or <b>regions</b> are affected more by EU integration. The reason is that for border <b>cities</b> and <b>regions</b> the changes in transaction costs that go along with EU integration are felt more intensely than for <b>cities</b> and <b>regions</b> that are located further from the former border and that are less peripheral. Both at the city and regional level, we find strong support that the EU integration process has been beneficial for the share population growth of border <b>cities</b> and <b>regions.</b> This positive integration effect is more important for larger <b>cities</b> and <b>regions.</b> Despite this positive effect a border location remains a location burden...|$|R
