40|$|One of {{the most}} unfortunate {{legacies}} of more than 100 years of mining in the Central Witwatersrand Mining Basin {{is the presence of}} many unsafe mine related openings such as shafts and subsidences that are present {{in the southern part of}} the city of Johannesburg. Using available mine plans and knowledge of the manner in which these holes were formed, a search was undertaken and a total of 244 openings were located. A literature survey revealed that perimeter walls, <b>concrete</b> seals and <b>plugs</b> have most often been used to prevent human access to these unsafe mine openings. Locally mine openings have most often been backfilled with available materials though <b>concrete</b> <b>plugs</b> or seals, walls and fences have also commonly been used. In order to assess which holes should be considered for sealing, a simple “hole risk rating system” was developed, which considered the depth of the hole and its proximity to settlements or thoroughfares. During a Department of Minerals and Energy project led by the author, it was concluded that <b>concrete</b> <b>plugs</b> were probably the most effective method of sealing such unsafe mine openings. Eighty holes were thus sealed using unreinforced, <b>concrete</b> <b>plugs.</b> Polyurethane Foam (PUF) has been used as an alternative method to seal mine openings in the United States for nearly 25 years and was used here to seal two abandoned mine openings. This method requires minimal design, engineering supervision and offers a quick, simple, cost effective and environmentally friendly method of sealing such openings.

40|$|Cement-based {{materials}} {{for use as}} sealants in underground waste storages must be erosion-resistant and chemically stable. Placement of highly radioactive waste (HLW) in boreholes may require that the rock is cement-grouted and stabilized by constructing <b>concrete</b> <b>plugs.</b> Where smectitic clay seals are in contact with concrete there is mutual degradation, and low-pH cement with inorganic superplasticizers, like talc, are recommended for preparing the concrete. This paper reviews our current state-of-knowledge concerning the grout and concrete sealing very deep boreholes (DBD) for purpose of high-level radioactive waste disposal. In this concept, the lower 2  km section of 4  km deep holes bored in crystalline rock could host waste-containers while the upper parts are sealed by dense clay and concrete. 1  The parts of such a hole that intersect fracture-poor rock are sealed with dense expandable clay while concrete is cast where fracture zones are intersected.

40|$|Ground {{penetrating}} radar (GPR) {{surveys are}} performed {{to determine the}} depth to the water table and the tops of wood piles beneath a residential structure at 122 Beacon Street in Back Bay, Boston. The area of Boston known as the Back Bay was once a tidal estuary of the Charles River. During {{the latter half of}} the 19 th century, the Back Bay was filled to create room for the city's expanding population. Most of the structures built in the Back Bay during this period were residential buildings supported by untreated wood pile foundations. Submerged beneath the water table, untreated wood piles maintain their structural integrity indefinitely. However, recent groundwater fluctuations throughout the Back Bay have exposed the tops of some of the piles, causing the exposed areas to rot. Rotted wood piles weaken a structure's foundation and often result in differential settlement or cracking in walls or foundations. The current method of investigating suspected pile failure is to excavate a foundation and to physically inspect the piles, noting the elevation of the water table.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, a {{progressive}} abandon of underground coal mines {{is taking place}} {{as a consequence of}} different factors. Frequently, these closed mines or sections of mines are connected through galleries to other mines still in operation. In these cases it is necessary to maintain the water extraction in the zones already abandoned in order to prevent the flooding of the areas in operation, with the consequent increase of operating costs. A possible solution to this problem is the construction of <b>concrete</b> <b>plugs</b> in order to seal the connection between active and abandoned zones. Nevertheless, due to the depth of the mining works, which frequently exceeds 400 m, the hydrostatic pressures that will support the plugs are much higher than the pressure held by the conventional dams so they will require an efficient design and anchorage. On the other hand, in order to guarantee the sealing capacity of the plugs, a careful selection of the most appropriate location for the plugs with regard to the mechanical and hydraulic characteristics of the rock, and a detailed knowledge on such hydrogeological environment is necessary so to avoid the communication through possible groundwater preferential pathways.

40|$|International audienceNuclear waste {{repositories}} {{will use}} a significant quantity of cement: {{for the construction of}} accessdrifts, disposal cells and <b>concrete</b> <b>plugs,</b> and as containment material for low- to intermediate-levelwaste. Several European countries have chosen claystone formations as possible host rocks (Landais, 2006). Numerous cement/clay interfaces will thus be present in a radioactive-waste repository. Due to contrasting geochemical conditions (including Eh, pH, solution composition), these interfacesare subjected to steep concentration gradients and are highly reactive. Predicting long-term changes(1, 000 to 100, 000 years) in these cementitious and clayey materials is thus crucial for assessing thebehaviour of such infrastructures. Experiments cannot provide sufficiently reliable information oversuch long time scale. Although natural and archaeological analogues can be very helpful, modelling isthe unique tool to analyse and test different evolution scenarios. In order to build a better confidence insuch calculations, it is of paramount importance to demonstrate that the results obtained are notdependent on the choice of the numerical reactive transport code to perform the simulation. In order toaddress this issue, a benchmark problem, divided into three steps with increasing geochemicalrefinement, has been set up (Marty et al., submitted). In all cases, the solutes transport across the interface between clayey host rock and concrete isdiffusion driven and a 1 D radial geometry and isothermal conditions (25 °C) have been bothconsidered. Both materials are full saturated. The first step of the benchmark only considers porewatersolutions and the clayed host rock which is only modelled by an exchanger. The second stepintroduces the full mineralogy for both the concrete and the claystone considering slow kinetics ratesfor mineral dissolution-precipitation reactions, whereas the third one focuses on fast reaction rates. Seven international teams have been involved in this benchmarking exercise. All reactive transportcodes used (TOUGHREACT, PHREEQC with two different ways of handling transport,CRUNCHFLOW, HYTEC, ORCHESTRA, MIN 3 P-THCm) gave very similar patterns in terms ofpredicted solute concentrations and of minerals distribution evolution (Fig. 1).
