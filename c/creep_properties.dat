50|$|Inconel 625 was {{designed}} as a solid solution strengthened material with no significant microstructure. This holds true at low and high temperatures, but there is a region (923 to 1148 K) where precipitates form that are detrimental to the <b>creep</b> <b>properties,</b> and thus the strength, of the alloy. Under any creep conditions (high temperature with an applied stress), M23C6-type carbides form at the grain boundaries. When tested at 973 K, γ” precipitates begin forming. These γ” phase precipitates are ordered A3 B type with a composition of Ni3(Nb, Al, Ti) and a tetragonal crystal structure. They form a disk-shaped morphology and are coherent with respect to the matrix. When tested at 998 K, a δ-phase precipitate begins forming which consist of Ni3(Nb, Mo) in a orthorhombic crystal structure. They form in a needle-like morphology and are incoherent with the matrix. Both of these precipitates can be completely dissolved back into the matrix when the sample is heated 1148 K. This leads to the ability to recover <b>creep</b> <b>properties</b> of the alloy to prolong the materials lifetime.|$|E

40|$|The time-temperature-stress {{equivalent}} (TTSE) principle {{refers to}} the phenomenon that the time-dependent mechanical properties of materials rely on the variations of temperature and stress level. Thus, {{it is reasonable to}} predict the long time material mechanical properties based on their relationships with rising temperatures and stress levels. According to the single-integral nonlinear constitutive equation proposed by Schapery, a general expression of the TTSE principle for nonlinear viscoelastic <b>creep</b> <b>property</b> is deduced. The specific expression for time-temperature-stress shift factor is presented by assuming quadratic polynomial form of the Doolittle formula for the viscosity as a function of free volume. Creep curves of granite at different temperatures and stress levels are introduced, and the validation of applying time-temperature-stress principle to predict the long time <b>creep</b> <b>property</b> of granite is provided. The master curves are generated through vertical shift modification and horizontal shift equivalence of all creep curves, and corresponding coefficients in the shift equations are determined by curve fittings.

50|$|Since {{the mantle}} is {{primarily}} composed of olivine ((Mg,Fe)2SiO4), the rheological {{characteristics of the}} mantle are largely those of olivine. Additionally, due to the varying temperatures and pressures between the lower and upper mantle, a variety of creep processes can occur with dislocation creep dominating in the lower mantle and diffusional creep occasionally dominating in the upper mantle. However, {{there is a large}} transition region in creep processes between the upper and lower mantle and even within each section, <b>creep</b> <b>properties</b> can change strongly with location and thus temperature and pressure.

50|$|The <b>creep</b> <b>properties</b> of ODS steels {{are highly}} {{dependent}} {{on the characteristics of}} the nano-oxides particles which exist in the metal matrix, specifically the ability of these particles to prevent dislocation motion as well as the size and distribution of the particles. Hoelzer and coworkers have shown that an alloy containing a homogeneous dispersion of 1-5 nm Y2Ti2O7 nanoclusters has superior <b>creep</b> <b>properties</b> to an alloy with a heterogeneous dispersion of 5-20 nm nanoclusters of the same composition. In the pursuit of new ODS steels it is important to focus on processes that allow for the formation of a dense homogeneous dispersion of small nanoclusters. ODS steels are commonly produced through ball-milling an oxide of interest (e.g. Y2O3, Al2O3) with pre-alloyed metal powders followed by compression and sintering of the material. It is believed that the nano-oxides enter into solid solution with the metal during ball-milling and subsequently precipitate during the thermal treatment to yield the ODS steel. This process seems simple but many parameters need to be carefully controlled to produce a well made alloy. Work by Leseigneur and coworkers has been done to carefully control some of these parameters in order to get more consistent and better microstructures in ODS steels. In this two step method the oxide is ball-milled {{for longer periods of time}} to ensure a homogeneous solid solution of the oxide in the metal matrix. Then the powder is annealed at higher temperatures to begin a controlled nucleation of the nano-oxide clusters. Finally the powder is again compressed and sintered to yield the final material.|$|E

The firm {{has a reputation for}} assessing structural or interior damage to buildings. Nationally, SGH is recognized as an expert on the science and causes of structural failure. For example, when mirror-glass panels began falling off Boston's John Hancock Tower and had to be temporarily replaced with plywood in 1973, SGH was hired to analyze what went wrong. More recently, SGH was hired by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to investigate the collapse of New York's World Trade Center and assess the Towers' structural response to impact damage and fire after the September 11, 2001 attacks. NIST retained SGH to develop computer models simulating the towers’ structural response to aircraft impact and subsequent fires. Several studies, conducted by NIST and its consultants, provided input for the SGH study, including aircraft impact analysis, fire dynamics and heat transfer models. NIST also tested structural steel recovered from the WTC site to determine its mechanical and metallurgical properties including temperature-dependent thermal expansion, modulus, plastic flow, and <b>creep</b> <b>properties.</b> SGH first developed models of components, connections, and subsystems of the WTC towers and studied their structural response to fire-induced temperatures over time. Using results of such studies, SGH developed computationally efficient global models of the towers and performed FE analyses from initial impact through each tower’s collapse.|$|E

The results indicated that the creep and mechano-sorptive creep were both related to the ratio of the vascular bundle to parenchyma.

40|$|Understanding the <b>creep</b> <b>properties</b> of gas shales at {{elevated}} temperatures {{is critical}} for accurately predicting reservoir performance and assessing the effect of viscous behavior on closure rate, production rate, and conductivity loss. In order to better understand <b>creep</b> <b>properties</b> at in-situ conditions, a quantitative relationship between temperature, mechanical properties, and complex chemo-physical mechanisms that causes thermal alteration needs to be obtained. In this study, elastic, strength, and <b>creep</b> <b>properties</b> of organic-rich shales are investigated {{by a combination of}} nanoindentation, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and micromechanical modeling over a range of temperatures (23 - 350 ?C). In particular, elastic and strength properties are extracted through nanoindentation between temperatures of 23 - 350 ?C and <b>creep</b> <b>properties</b> are measured similarly between temperatures of 23 - 300 ?C. Within the allotted temperature range, the elastic and strength properties of the porous clay/kerogen phase remains unchanged due to the highly mature organic matter and low water content present within the matrix. A similar behavior is noticed in the creep modulus from temperatures 23 - 200 ?C where it remains relatively unchanged and shows an isotropic characteristic. However, the creep modulus of the clay phase increases at 300 ?C in both parallel and perpendicular directions to the bedding plane. In addition, the indentation modulus and hardness increase at 300 ?C are a result of the enhancement of particle sliding and compaction of clay particles due to the transformation of organic matter to hydrocarbons. Analysis of the creep data obtained in this experimental effort sheds light on the dictating role of organic matter and porosity on <b>creep</b> <b>properties</b> of organic-rich shales and emphasizes the pivotal role of organic matter in the time-dependent response. Specifically, the isotropic increase also suggests that the isotropic phases, which are organic matter and porosity, {{play an important role in}} driving <b>creep</b> <b>properties</b> in shales. Evaluation of the probability density functions (PDF) of the contact creep modulus suggests that a bimodal distribution occurs between temperatures of 23 - 200 ?C which corresponds to two different modes: the clay/kerogen mode (mode I) and the porous clay mode (mode II). However, at 300 ?C, a unimodal trend exists that aligns closely with mode II, indicating that it is only linked to the porous clay phase rather than the clay/kerogen mode...|$|E
