40|$|China’s long {{insistence on}} non-interference and {{sovereignty}} and frequent criticism of Western interventionism {{has contributed to}} a widely held impression that China lends and invests abroad without attaching policy conditions. This discussion paper surveys the general policy debate on conditionality in lending, as well as China’s own debate on conditionality. We then examine bilateral loans provided by Chinese state-owned policy banks, notably China Exim Bank, arguing that the assumption of China’s shunning conditionality is valid only if the term is taken narrowly to imply the specific set of policy conditions (e. g. privatisation and financial liberalisation) routinely called for by World Bank Group lenders. Based on a literature review and analysis of loan features along with tentative evidence from empirical cases of Chinese bilateral lending, we identify four hypothetical types of conditionality: political conditionality, embedded conditionality, <b>cross-conditionality</b> and emergent conditionality. In all likelihood the last three types of conditionality are not imposed by a unitary state actor, but emerge as an indirect consequence of the voluminous business activities of Chinese state-linked lenders and enterprises in developing countries.

40|$|In the {{literature}} there seems a certain {{consensus that the}} international dimension {{played an important role}} in influencing the choices of Central-East European countries (CEECs) and most of the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union (NIS) in introducing democracy and market-oriented economies. The aim of the chapter is to examine how certain external economic influences affected democratic consolidation and the introduction of market forces in the post-communist countries. The analysis concentrates on the role played by external economic actors, taking as a case study the IMF. At times the IMF was accused of undermining the sovereignty and political legitimacy of beneficiary countries. These countries are said to have little choice but to accept the unpopular measures forced upon them by the IMF. It is true that at times when the external situation of a country deteriorated rapidly, with balance of payments disequilibrium, loss of reserves and, in some cases, difficulty in servicing foreign debt, transition countries were heavily dependent on the IMF for assistance (in particular, because of the application of <b>cross-conditionality</b> by other international organisations such as the EU). However, over time the bargaining power of the recipient country appears to have played an important role, and all the transition countries proved unwilling or unable to protract the application of austerity measures for more than a year or two. Given the claims of mistaken policies, undue interference and lack of transparency against the IMF on the one hand, and the increasing volatility of the international financial system on the other, the debate about reform of the international financial architecture acquired a new urgency. In the case of Europe one of the main reforms proposed, i. e. an increased role for regional integration blocs, has de facto already been implemented. At least in the countries, which have applied for membership, the EU is the main external actor, and applies a more far-reaching and stringent economic and political conditionality than was ever the case for the IMF...|$|E
40|$|The ways of {{promoting}} European values beyond Europe has changed. Instead of enlarging, the European Union (EU) now offers partnerships to its neighbours. Theories of European integration {{tend to focus}} on integration within the EU. The focus of this thesis, however, will be the members of the Eastern Partnership (EaP) and why they choose an integration option that formally leaves them {{on the outside of the}} EU. This thesis seeks to investigate how external governance theory explains why third party states become subjects of EU policy through external Europeanisation. The EaP is the Eastern dimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). It is a cooperation platform between the EU and six Eastern European states: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, The Republic of Moldova and Ukraine. Conditionality is an important aspect of the EaP: The EU demands reform in the partner states in order to give them rewards. External governance is the study of how states beyond Europe adapt EU rules, and how these rules are transferred. This research applies models of external governance to a comparative case study of three EaP states: Armenia, Georgia and the Republic of Moldova. The models are the external incentives model, the social learning model and the lesson-drawing model. The first model focuses on the costs and benefits of external governance, relative bargaining power, and determinacy and the size and speed of rewards. The second model focuses on similarity of identity, appropriateness of rules and the persuasive power of the external actor. The third model focuses on a dissatisfaction of the domestic status quo, which leads national policy makers to look abroad for solutions to their challenges. In the comparative case study, these models will explain the individual choices of the chosen cases. When the models of external governance are applied to the case study, the conclusions are many. Firstly, it is difficult to be a small country between the EU and Russia, especially when you have two choose one of the two blocs. Secondly, the EU and the EaP states are rational actors who seek to maximise their own benefits through this cooperation. Therefore, they consider the cost and benefits of such agreements carefully before entering them. Thirdly, the case study shows that external governance theory accounts well for the partners choices as long as there is no <b>cross-conditionality</b> with competing external powers. As soon as Russia offers similar benefits or more apparent threats than the EU, external governance theory does not explain sufficiently the mechanisms behind the EaP states’ behaviour...|$|E
