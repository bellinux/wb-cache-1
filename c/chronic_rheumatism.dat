Ah Moy, had he not long since been delivered back to China by the immigration authorities, could have told him the meaning of that swelling, just as he could have told Dag Daughtry the meaning of the increasing area of numbness between his eyes where the tiny, vertical, lion-lines were cutting more conspicuously. Also, could he have told him what was wrong with the little finger on his left hand. Daughtry had first diagnosed it as a sprain of a tendon. Later, he had decided it was <b>chronic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> brought on by the damp and foggy Sun Francisco climate. It was one of his reasons for desiring to get away again to sea where the tropic sun would warm the rheumatism out of him.|$|E

Well, I happened the other day to be at a meeting of old women at the `Beehive' in Spitalfields; there were some eighty or a hundred of them. With dim eyes and trembling fingers they were sewing garments for the boys who are to be sent out to Canada. Such feeble workers could not find employment elsewhere, but by liberal hearts a plan has been devised whereby many an aged one, past work, can earn a few pence. Twopence an hour is the pay. They are in the habit of meeting once a week for three hours, and thus earn sixpence. Many of these women, I may remark, are true Christians. I wondered how far such a sum would go, and how the poor old things spent it. One woman sixty-three years of age enlightened me.

Aim: Determine the frequency and respective proportion of the various etiological forms of arthritis in Lomé (Togo). Patients and Methods: Transversal study carried out over 15 years on files of arthritis infected patients and submitted to rheumatologic consultation. Results: 1081 out of 13, 517 patients examined (8 %) were suffering from arthritis. Those 1081 patients (456 women, 42. 2 % and 625 men, 57. 8 %) were in average 38 years old and enjoyed an average duration of evolution of three years. The <b>chronic</b> inflammatory <b>rheumatisms</b> (CIR) (602 cases, 56. 9 %), the metabolic ar-thropathies (233 cases, 22 %) and the infections (198 cases, 16. 6 %), were the main etiologies that were observed. The average age of 198 patients with infectious arthritis was 36 years and the average duration of 9 months. Infectious ar-thritis was preferably located at the knee (34. 3 %), and was essentially caused by a banal germ (157 patients; 79. 3 %) and associated with HIV in 25 patients (15. 9 %).

40|$|Background Since 2003, the {{tropical}} arthritogenic chikungunya (CHIK) virus {{has become an}} increasingly medical and economic burden in affected areas as it can often result in long-term disabili-ties.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an arbovirus, is {{responsible}} for a two-stage disabling disease, consisting of an acute febrile polyarthritis for the first 10 days, frequently followed by <b>chronic</b> <b>rheumatisms,</b> sometimes lasting for years. Up to now, the pathophysiology of the chronic stage has been elusive. Considering the existence of occasional peripheral vascular disorders and some unexpected seronegativity during the chronic stage of the disease, we hypothesized the role of cryoglobulins. METHODS: From April 2005 to May 2007, all travelers with suspected CHIKV infection were prospectively recorded in our hospital department. Demographic, clinical and laboratory findings (anti-CHIKV IgM and IgG, cryoglobulin) were registered at the first consultation or hospitalization and during follow-up. RESULTS: Among the 66 travelers with clinical suspicion of CHIKV infection, 51 presented anti-CHIKV IgM. There were 45 positive with the serological assay tested at room temperature, and six more, which first tested negative when sera were kept at 4 degrees C until analysis, became positive after a 2 -hour incubation of the sera at 37 degrees C. Forty-eight of the 51 CHIKV-seropositive patients were screened for cryoglobulinemia; 94 % were positive at least once during their follow-up. Over 90 % of the CHIKV-infected patients had concomitant arthralgias and cryoglobulinemia. Cryoglobulin prevalence and level drop with time as patients recover, spontaneously or after short-term corticotherapy. In some patients cryoglobulins remained positive after 1 year. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of mixed cryoglobulinemia was high in CHIKV-infected travelers with long-lasting symptoms. No significant association between cryoglobulinemia and clinical manifestations could be evidenced. The exact prognostic value of cryoglobulin levels {{has yet to be}} determined. Responsibility of cryoglobulinemia was suspected in unexpected false negativity of serological assays at room temperature, leading us to recommend performing serology on pre-warmed sera...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePolymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), a <b>chronic</b> {{inflammatory}} <b>rheumatism,</b> can be {{the expression}} of a paraneoplastic syndrome. The same clinical symptoms are frequently observed at the early stage of the benign and malignant forms. Here, our aim was to develop diagnostic tools to differentiate paraneoplastic PMR from essential PMR. We combined an 18 FDG-PET and detection of circulating procoagulant microparticles (MPs), such as fibrin positive (FibMPs), by flow cytometry. Two patients with PMR and a similar profile were selected. In the two patients, the 18 FDG-PET revealed a hypermetabolic focus. However, the concentrations of fibrin+/annexin+ microparticles detected were (10 times higher in one of the two patients, who was later found to have breast cancer. The association of 18 FDG-PET and the detection of microparticle fibrin positives by flow cytometry allows separating essential PMR (hypermetabolism by 18 FDG-PET, low FibMPs) from paraneoplastic PMR...|$|R

40|$|Background: Recent {{epidemiological}} data {{have shown a}} spread of Leishmania infantum in some Italian Northern regions, such us Emilia-Romagna. Although climate changes are influencing the epidemiology of leishmaniasis in Italy, immunosuppression {{has been identified as}} a major contributor to disease reemergence in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases who live in endemic areas for leishmania. Methods: a qPCR for L. infantum (Li) kDNA was tested in 50 patients affected by <b>chronic</b> inflammatory <b>rheumatism</b> (CRI), treated with biologic drugs (BD) for at least 5 years (Group A) and healthy controls (Group B). Demographic and clinical data were collected using questionnaires including residence, housing area (urban or rural context), ownership of a dog.

Since the variables were not normally distributed, group comparisons between controls and patients affected by CRI were performed using Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-square tests to compare differences in categorical variables. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to assess the independent effects of living in a rural area, having a dog or taking a steroid in association with a biological drug on the rate of positive PCR results against leishmania.
