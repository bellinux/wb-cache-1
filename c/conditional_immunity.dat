40|$|Liability of {{internet}} intermediaries for content created by third parties is a contentious area of defamation law. Recently, {{the law in}} New Zealand has begun to depart from English law, and move closer to strict liability. Parliament has responded with a ‘safe harbour’ in clause 20 of the Harmful Digital Communications Bill, which will provide online content hosts with <b>conditional</b> <b>immunity</b> from liability for content created by others. The author supports {{the creation of a}} legislative safe harbour for internet intermediaries, but highlights a number of deficiencies with clause 20 as currently drafted. This paper analyses the existing law, including possible defences, and clause 20. It also looks to other jurisdictions’ safe harbours, and concludes with recommendations on how clause 20 ought to be improved...|$|E
40|$|Background Medical {{students}} {{come into contact}} with infectious diseases early on their career. Immunity against vaccine-preventable diseases is therefore vital for both medical students and the patients with whom they come into contact. Methods The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the medical history and serological status of selected vaccine-preventable diseases of medical students in Germany. Results The overall correlation between medical history statements and serological findings among the 150 students studied was 86. 7 %, 66. 7 %, 78 % and 93. 3 % for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, <b>conditional</b> on sufficient <b>immunity</b> being achieved after one vaccination. Conclusions Although 81. 2 % of the students medical history data correlated with serological findings, significant gaps in immunity were found. Our findings indicate that medical history alone is not a reliable screening tool for immunity against the vaccine-preventable diseases studied...|$|R
500|$|Sally-Anne Croft and Susan Hagan were extradited from Britain in 1994, {{and were}} convicted {{by a jury}} {{decision}} on July 28, 1995, for their roles in the assassination plot. They had unsuccessfully attempted to appeal their extradition from Britain to Home Secretary Michael Howard. During their trial the prosecution presented twenty-nine witnesses, including former followers of Rajneesh who placed both women in planning meetings where they discussed murdering Turner. David Berry Knapp, {{the former mayor of}} Rajneeshpuram, testified for the government in the case and implicated Croft and Hagan in the assassination conspiracy. Ava Kay Avalos (Ma Ava), a Rajneesh disciple, testified in the Croft case and stated that she {{had been part of the}} conspirators that plotted to assassinate Turner. In addition to Knapp and Avalos, co-conspirators Richard Kevin Langford, Phyllis Caldwell, and Alma Peralta testified in the case pursuant to <b>conditional</b> plea or <b>immunity</b> agreements. Both women were sentenced to five years in prison. Croft and Hagan did not testify during their trial. [...] "We hashed over everything – evidence, notes, evidence, notes. I think we did an absolutely fabulous job," [...] said one of the jurors. At the sentencing for Croft and Hagan, the federal Judge Malcolm Marsh described them as [...] "people of obvious goodwill who had committed an extremely serious offense against the criminal justice system." [...] Prosecutor Tim Reardon called the conspiracy to commit assassination [...] "a deadly serious crime aimed at the heart of the criminal justice system." [...] Croft and Hagan were released from imprisonment at FCI Dublin, California, in April 1998, and returned to Britain.|$|R
