The analysis {{was based on a}} database of 128 substances classified as GHS Category 1 irritants (i. e., <b>corrosives</b> and <b>severe</b> <b>irritants)</b> based on 142 studies using a total of 661 rabbits. To conduct this analysis, individual rabbit responses were first classified according to the GHS classification system (UN 2003).

Calculation 1 assumed homogeneity of response for GHS Category 1 irritants; Calculation 2 assumed heterogeneity of response for GHS Category 1 irritants; and Calculation 3 assumed homogeneity of response for three subgroups of GHS Category 1 irritants. The three subgroups were: (1) strong responders, where all treated rabbits expressed a severe response; (2) moderate responders, where the majority but not all treated rabbits expressed a severe response; and (3) weak responders, where the majority of treated rabbits expressed a nonsevere irritant or nonirritant response.

40|$|The European Cosmetics Directive and REACH have {{accelerated}} {{the need for}} alternative tests. Especially the animal testing ban of cosmetic ingredients from 2009 strongly impacts on the timely delivery of relevant methods. ECVAM's key area "topical toxicity " focuses on skin and eye irritation/corrosion, phototoxicity and percutaneous absorption. Regulatory accepted alternative tests are available for skin corrosion, phototoxicity and percutaneous absorption. In the area of skin irritation, ECVAM recently finalised a study that demonstrates the scientific validity of a human reconstituted skin model to fully replace the animal test. In contrast, eye irritation testing will probably require an integrated testing strategy combining different in vitro assays that altogether might replace the animal test. To this end, ECVAM {{has contributed to the}} recent validation of organotypic models for detecting ocular <b>corrosives</b> and <b>severe</b> <b>irritants.</b> In parallel, four promising cytotoxicity- and cell-function- based assays are under evaluation by ECVAM.

40|$|The {{original}} ICCVAM recommended {{test method}} protocol {{described in the}} Test Method Evaluation Report (ICCVAM 2006) describes a method to determine the HET-CAM Irritation Score using the IS(B) analysis method based on the time in seconds required to develop hemorrhage, lysis, or coagulation over a 5 minute (300 second) time period (Kalweit et al. 1987; Kalweit et al. 1990). This recommended protocol was based on evaluation by ICCVAM of the usefulness and limitations of HET-CAM as screening test for the identification of ocular <b>corrosives</b> and <b>severe</b> <b>irritants.</b> ICCVAM is currently evaluating the usefulness and limitations of HET-CAM to 1) identify all ocular hazard categories, and 2) as a screening test for nonlabeled ocular irritants. Based on a retrospective evaluation of available data and information, the HET-CAM protocol that appears most promising for identify nonlabeled ocular irritants uses a different analysis method (i. e., the IS[A]) than the original ICCVAM protocol, and measures the development {{of each of the}} three HET-CAM endpoints at fixed time intervals of 0. 5, 2, and 5 minutes (Luepke 1985). However, in order to maximize the amount of information obtained during HET-CAM studies, ICCVAM recommends that users evaluate the time to development of each endpoint and then use the decision criteria according to the IS(A) protocol from Leupke (1985) to assign a hazard classification where IS(A) is recommended for classification categorization (e. g., Not Labeled). The availability of the additional information (i. e., time to endpoint development) could be useful in future analyses and optimization of HET-CAM decision criteria.

40|$|To reduce and/or {{replace the}} Draize test, testing schemes {{combining}} strengths of particular in vitro assays were proposed during a 2005 ECVAM expert meeting.

Furthermore as its core activity, ECVAM participated in the retrospective validation of and has peer reviewed scientific validity of four organotypic assays, and undertook retrospective validation of four cell function/cytotoxicity assays. The BCOP and ICE organotypic assays were ICCVAM and ESAC endorsed as scientifically valid for identifying <b>severe</b> <b>irritants,</b> and OECD Test Guidelines are under adoption. NRR, FL and CM cell function/cytotoxicity assays were recommended by an ECVAM Validation Management Group for identification of non-irritants or <b>severe</b> eye <b>irritants</b> in the Bottom-Up/Top-Down approaches. These assays were peer reviewed by ESAC during 2009.

40|$|In {{spite of}} over 20 years of effort, no single {{in vitro assay}} has been {{developed}} and validated as a full regulatory replacement for the Draize Eye Irritation test. However, companies have been using in vitro methods to screen new formulations {{and in some cases}} as their primary assessment of eye irritation potential for many years. The present report shows the outcome of an Expert Meeting convened by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods in February 2005 to identify test strategies for eye irritation. In this workshop test developers/users were requested to nominate methods to be considered as a basis for the identification of such testing strategies. Assays were evaluated and categorized based on their proposed applicability domains (e. g., categories of irritation severity, modes of action, chemical class, physicochemical compatibility). The analyses were based on the data developed from current practice and published studies, the ability to predict depth of injury (within the applicable range of severity), modes of action that could be addressed and compatibility with different physiochemical forms. The difficulty in predicting the middle category of irritancy (e. g. R 36, GHS Categories 2 A and 2 B) was recognized. The testing scheme proposes using a Bottom-Up (begin with using test methods that can accurately identify non-irritants) or Top-Down (begin with using test methods that can accurately identify <b>severe</b> <b>irritants)</b> progression of in vitro tests (based on expected irritancy). Irrespective of the starting point, the approach would identify non-irritants and <b>severe</b> <b>irritants,</b> leaving all others to the (mild/moderate) irritant GHS 2 / R 36 categories. JRC.

Fumaric acid is considered safe for {{pigs and poultry}} provided that an expected use level of 20 000 mg/kg in complete diets for pigs and poultry is not exceeded. The margin of safety for pigs and poultry is approximately two. The tolerated fumaric acid concentration in complete diets for ruminants is higher. The margin of safety for pigs, poultry and ruminants is sufficiently high that setting a maximum content is not necessary. In contrast, the maximum safe level in milk replacer for veal calves (and probably other young mammals) is provisionally estimated to be 10 000 mg/kg milk replacer, with no margin of safety. Fumaric acid is rapidly metabolised by well-recognised pathways, and neither fumarate nor its metabolites are expected to accumulate in animal tissues. Consequently, human exposure {{is not expected to}} be increased by the use of fumaric acid in animal nutrition. Fumaric acid is a <b>severe</b> <b>irritant</b> to eyes.

In major evaluation {{studies conducted in}} the 1990 ¿s, no single method was found able to fully replace the Draize eye irritation test. However, some alternatives showed good reproducibility and reliability. In 2006, ECVAM initiated the retrospective validation of four assays based on cytotoxicity and cell function: 1) Neutral Red Release (NRR), 2) Red Blood Cell test, 3) Fluorescein Leakage (FL) and 4) Cytosensor Microphysiometer (CM). The study was coordinated by an international Validation Management Group (VMG) including observers from ICCVAM-NICEATM and JaCVAM. The existing data were collected and compiled according to ECVAM Principles of Weight-of-Evidence Validation. The resulting Background Review Document (BRD) for each assay was structured according to the ECVAM Modular Approach to Validation and underwent independent quality control audits. The VMG evaluated the four BRDs and made recommendations concerning the suitability of the assays {{to be used in}} the Bottom-Up and Top-Down Approaches for Eye irritation Testing Strategy proposed in a 2005 ECVAM expert meeting, to reduce and replace in vivo studies. In particular, the CM protocol INVITTOX 102 -modified and the FL protocol INVITTOX 71 were recommended as suitable to discriminate <b>severe</b> <b>irritants</b> from other classes. Furthermore, the FL protocol INVITTOX 120 and the NRR protocol INVITTOX 54 and PREDISAFETM were recommended as suitable to discriminate non-irritants from other classes.

40|$|AIM: To report our {{experience}} in the surgical management of severe injuries of the gastrointestinal tract due to corrosive ingestion. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients who underwent emergency surgery for severe gastrointestinal injuries following corrosive ingestion between 1983 and 2010 was carried out. Data was extracted from a prospectively maintained esophageal disease database. <b>Severe</b> <b>corrosive</b> injuries were defined as full thickness necrosis with perforation of the esophagus or the stomach (with or without involvement of the adjacent viscera) with resultant mediastinitis or peritonitis. RESULTS: Between 1983 and 2010, 209 patients with corrosive injury of the esophagus were managed. Of these, 13 (6. 2 %) patients underwent emergency surgery for <b>severe</b> <b>corrosive</b> injury. The median age of the patients was 22 years and the median interval between ingestion of the corrosive substance and surgery was 24 h. The surgical procedures done included esophagogastrectomy alone (n = 6), esophagogastrectomy with duodenectomy (n = 4), esophagogastrectomy with pancreaticoduodenectomy (n = 1), esophagogastrectomy with splenectomy (n = 1) and distal gastrectomy with duodenectomy (n = 1). Two patients died in the postoperative period and one after discharge awaiting the second surgery. The factors significantly predictive of mortality following such an injury included renal failure {{at the time of}} initial presentation, presence of metabolic acidosis, delay of more than 24 h between corrosive ingestion and surgery, and corrosive induced adjacent organ injury (pancreatic) (P < 0. 001, 0. 02, 0. 005 and 0. 015 respectively). Ten patients underwent subsequent surgery for restoration of the alimentary tract continuity with a colonic pull-up (n = 8) and gastrojejunostomy (n = 1). In one patient, the attempted colon pull-up failed due to extensive scarring of the mesocolon. The median follow up (following restoration of continuity of the gastrointestinal tract) was 36. 5 mo. One patient developed dysphagia due to a stricture at the anastomotic site, which was successfully managed by dilatation. Another patient developed severe aspiration, necessitating laryngeal inlet closure and permanent tracheostomy, and 3 patients complained of occasional regurgitation. CONCLUSION: Management of <b>severe</b> <b>corrosive</b> injury involves prompt resuscitation and urgent surgical debridement.

Department of Energy {{to develop a}} plan for inclusion in the fiscal year 2000 budget for conversion of the Department's stockpile of depleted uranium hexafluoride (DUF{sub 6 }) to a more stable form over an extended period. The conversion process into a more stable form will produce fluorine compounds (e. g., elemental fluorine or hydrofluoric acid) that need to be handled safely. This document compiles the requirements necessary to handle these materials within health and safety standards, which may apply in order to ensure protection of the environment and the safety and health of workers and the public. Fluorine is a pale-yellow gas with a pungent, irritating odor. It is the most reactive nonmetal and will react vigorously with most oxidizable substances at room temperature, frequently with ignition. Fluorine is a <b>severe</b> <b>irritant</b> of the eyes, mucous membranes, skin, and lungs. In humans, the inhalation of high concentrations causes laryngeal spasm and broncospasms, followed by the delayed onset of pulmonary edema. At sublethal levels, severe local irritation and laryngeal spasm will preclude voluntary exposure to high concentrations, unless the individual is trapped or incapacitated. A blast of fluorine gas on the shaved skin of a rabbit causes a second degree burn. Lower concentrations cause severe burns of insidious onset, resulting in ulceration, similar to the effects produced by hydrogen fluoride. Hydrofluoric acid is a colorless, fuming liquid or gas with a pungent odor. It is soluble in water with release of heat. Ingestion of an estimated 1. 5 grams produced sudden death without gross pathological damage. Repeated ingestion of small amounts resulted in moderately advanced hardening of the bones. Contact of skin with anhydrous liquid produces severe burns. Inhalation of AHA or aqueous hydrofluoric acid mist or vapors can cause severe respiratory tract irritation that may be fatal. Based on the extreme chemical properties of these chemicals as noted above, fluorine or fluorine compounds must be handled appropriately within the boundaries of many safety requirements {{for the protection of the}} environment and the public.
