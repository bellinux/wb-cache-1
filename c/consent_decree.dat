5|$|Judge Green {{presided over}} a number of notable cases during his 35-year tenure on the Eastern District. In Bolden v. Pennsylvania State Police Judge Green ordered the Pennsylvania State Police to {{reinstate}} William Bolden, a minority trooper who had been dismissed. The case, which began in 1973, resulted in a <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> that required the State Police to hire one minority for every non-minority hired, and set additional goals for promotion and retention of minority troopers. Judge Green presided over the <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> for 25 years, dissolving it in 1999. The case was credited with helping to abolish racism in the hiring of troopers, and integrate the State Police.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, the <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> of 1948 forcing film studios to divest {{themselves}} of theater chains and the competitive pressure of television had caused significant financial distress at MGM. In a gamble {{to save the}} studio, and inspired {{by the success of}} Paramount Pictures' 1956 Biblical epic The Ten Commandments, studio head Joseph Vogel announced in 1957 that MGM would again move forward on a remake of Ben-Hur. Filming started in May 1958 and wrapped in January 1959, and post-production took six months. Although the budget for Ben-Hur was initially $7 million, it was reported to be $10 million by February 1958, reaching $15.175 million by the time shooting began—making it the costliest film ever produced up to that time. When adjusted for inflation, the budget of Ben Hur was approximately $ in constant dollars.|$|E
5|$|Offscreen, Robert Mitchum's {{arrest and}} {{conviction}} for marijuana possession—he would serve {{two months in}} jail—was widely assumed to mean career death for RKO's most promising young star, but Hughes surprised the industry by announcing that his contract was not endangered. Of much broader significance, Hughes decided to get the jump on his Big Five competitors by being the first to settle the federal government's antitrust suit against the major studios, which had won a crucial Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. Under the <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> he signed, Hughes agreed to dissolve the old parent company, Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corp., and split RKO's production-distribution business and its exhibition chain into two entirely separate corporations—RKO Pictures Corp. and RKO Theatres Corp.—with the obligation to promptly sell off one or the other. While Hughes delayed the divorcement procedure until December 1950 and didn't actually sell his stock in the theater company for another three years, his decision to acquiesce {{was one of the}} crucial steps in the collapse of classical Hollywood's studio system.|$|E

40|$|Clear {{disagreement}} exists {{about how}} best to reconcile the copyright protections afforded to songwriters with the antitrust considerations protecting consumers. Songwriter public performance royalty collections account for over $ 2 billion in annual U. S. revenue, roughly 90 % of which is collected by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) and Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI). ASCAP and BMI are performance rights organizations (PROs) regulated by seventy-five-year-old <b>consent</b> <b>decrees.</b> After the Second Circuit determined that these <b>consent</b> <b>decrees</b> prohibit music publishers from selectively withdrawing their new media rights from ASCAP and BMI to directly negotiating with new media services, the PROs and major publishers petitioned the DOJ to amend their <b>consent</b> <b>decrees.</b> However, after two years of review, the DOJ decided to issue clarifications regarding the practice of fractional licensing, which, despite the similar sounding name, is distinct from partial withdrawal. The DOJ’s decision to mandate 100 % licensing broke with industry practice, prompting BMI to seek declaratory judgment favoring fractional licensing; the DOJ subsequently appealed. As fractional licensing is set for appeal, the <b>consent</b> <b>decrees</b> seem ripe for further review.

40|$|<b>Consent</b> <b>decrees</b> raise serious Article III concerns. When litigants {{agree on}} {{their rights and}} jointly seek the same relief from a court, {{they are no longer}} adverse and a {{justiciable}} controversy no longer exists between them. In the absence of an actual controversy between opposing parties, it is both inappropriate and unnecessary for a court to issue a substantive order declaring or modifying the litigants’ rights. Whether Article III’s adverseness requirement is seen as jurisdictional or prudential, federal courts should decline to issue <b>consent</b> <b>decrees</b> and instead require litigants that wish to voluntarily resolve a case to execute a settlement agreement, which, as a private contract, does not implicate the same justiciability problems. <b>Consent</b> <b>decrees</b> raise unique separation-of-powers issues in lawsuits against government entities concerning the validity, proper interpretation, or enforcement of statutes or regulations. Government agencies and officials may accede to such decrees to entrench their policy preferences against future change, impose legal restrictions and obligations on their successors, and constrain those successors’ discretion—all without a court determining that such relief is legally necessary. Such concerns would not arise if government defendants resolved such cases through settlement agreements, because the reserved powers doctrine and general prohibition on specific enforcement of government contracts prevent government entities from using settlement agreements to improperly limit their (and their successors’) discretion and authority. If courts are not willing to refuse to categorically decline to issue <b>consent</b> <b>decrees</b> on Article III grounds then, at a minimum, they should require litigants in government-defendant cases to demonstrate that the plaintiff has stated valid claims and that the requested relief is required to remedy the legal violations at issue. Courts must ensure that government defendants do not use <b>consent</b> <b>decrees</b> to circumvent the traditional legislative and regulatory processes and establish binding requirements for which there is not actually any constitutional or legal basis...|$|R
