5|$|Along with {{quadratic}} probing {{and double}} hashing, linear probing {{is a form}} of open addressing. In these schemes, each <b>cell</b> <b>of</b> a hash table stores a single key–value pair. When the hash function causes a collision by mapping a new key to a <b>cell</b> <b>of</b> the hash table that is already occupied by another key, linear probing searches the table for the closest following free location and inserts the new key there. Lookups are performed in the same way, by searching the table sequentially starting at the position given by the hash function, until finding a cell with a matching key or an empty cell.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} the results of immunohistochemical studies on the distribution of intermediary filamentous proteins vimentin and cytokeratin in bitch mammary gland tumors, which had been previously classified according to the latest WHO-classification (1999). The overall test specimen included 45 bitches of different breeds and age, which resulted in diagnosing 27 malignant neoplasms, 11 benign neoplasms, and 3 hyperplastic-dysplastic changes, while 4 test specimens were taken from healthy bitches. The commonest malignant neoplasms were: simple adenocarcinoma (13 cases) and complex adenocarcinoma (7). Among the benign neoplasms the ones that dominated were benign mixed tumors (8 cases). Vimentin was expressed on neoplastic proliferative suprabasal myoepithelial <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> simple adenocarcinomas; on resting, spindleshaped and star-shaped myoepithelial <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> complex adenocarcinomas; on cartilage <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> carcinomas in the mixed tumor and benign mixed tumors; on osteoid <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> osteosarcoma; and on myofibroblasts of simple adenocarcinomas, complex adenocarcinomas, carcinomas in the mixed tumor and benign mixed tumors, and connective tissue fibres of fibrosarcoma. The expression of cytokeratin was noticed on canalicular and alveolar lumen epithelium of simple adenocarcinomas; on epithelial <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> complex adenocarcinomas, carcinomas in the mixed tumor, mutinous carcinomas, fibrosarcoma and of osteosarcoma; on resting and starshaped myoepithelial <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> complex adenocarcinomas and carcinomas in the mixed tumor; as well as on spindle-shaped myoepithelial <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> carcinomas in the mixed tumor.

5|$|Although cholangiocarcinoma {{is known}} to have the {{histological}} and molecular features of an adenocarcinoma of epithelial cells lining the biliary tract, the actual <b>cell</b> <b>of</b> origin is unknown. Recent evidence has suggested that the initial transformed cell that generates the primary tumor may arise from a pluripotent hepatic stem cell. Cholangiocarcinoma is thought to develop through a series of stages - from early hyperplasia and metaplasia, through dysplasia, to the development of frank carcinoma - in a process similar to that seen in the development of colon cancer. Chronic inflammation and obstruction of the bile ducts, and the resulting impaired bile flow, are thought {{to play a role in}} this progression.|$|E
5|$|For instance, {{when one}} <b>cell</b> <b>of</b> a {{spreadsheet}} changes, {{it is necessary}} to recalculate the values of other cells that depend directly or indirectly on the changed cell. For this problem, the tasks to be scheduled are the recalculations of the values of individual cells of the spreadsheet. Dependencies arise when an expression in one cell uses a value from another cell. In such a case, the value that is used must be recalculated earlier than the expression that uses it. Topologically ordering the dependency graph, and using this topological order to schedule the cell updates, allows the whole spreadsheet to be updated with only a single evaluation per cell. Similar problems of task ordering arise in makefiles for program compilation and instruction scheduling for low-level computer program optimization.|$|E
