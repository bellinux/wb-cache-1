5|$|As {{the date}} of the {{operation}} approached, training became more intensive. Glider units spent hours aloft every day circling over airfields as they practiced the manoeuvers required to land the airborne forces next to the bridges over the Orne River, the Caen canal, the Dives, and the Merville battery. Once the pilots had practiced this sufficiently during the day, they were then switched to night operations. In the landing grounds used by the division for their operations, dozens of poles similar to those in Normandy were erected, with engineering units then timed on how fast they could demolish the obstacles. The battalion assigned to neutralising Merville spent two weeks at a special camp, where they built a replica of the battery and carried out several rehearsal exercises in and around it. The force assigned to the coup-de-main operation, to capture the bridges over the Orne River and Caen canal, were transferred to Exeter. There, they conducted intensive exercises around the River Exe and the nearby canal that stood in place for their real objective. The pilots of the gliders and transport aircraft were also constantly briefed with thousands of maps and photographs of the landing zones and the surrounding areas, as well as dozens of scale models of the zones and the primary objectives, such as the bridges and the Merville battery. A coloured film was produced from aerial reconnaissance photographs which, when played at the <b>correct</b> <b>speed</b> and height over the scale models, realistically simulated the paths the glider pilots would take towards their landing-zones.|$|E

The sound is encoded by fine variations in the edges of the groove that cause a stylus (needle) placed in it to vibrate at acoustic frequencies when the disc is rotated at the <b>correct</b> <b>speed.</b> Generally, the outer and inner parts of the groove bear no intended sound (exceptions include the Beatles' Sgt.

25|$|The axis of {{rotation}} itself precesses around the pipe axis resulting in a rotating force at the pipe exit and results in a rotating dipole sound field.

A more <b>correct</b> <b>speed</b> would be that characteristic of the swirl fd, where f is the precession (and sound) frequency, based on the Rossby number. To test the relevance of this new characteristic speed, the flow rate was increased and the frequency and level of the sound was measured. Using the dipole model, the calculated force was found to be nearly proportional to (fd)2, confirming the correctness of the new characteristic speed.|$|E

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{investigation of the}} over-all performance of a simply constructed, short-life, turbojet engine was conducted.

The <b>corrected</b> engine <b>speed</b> was varied from the minimum for good combustion to about 17, 000 rpm, which is approximately 75 percent of rated speed.

2500|$|The first D-21 was {{completed}} {{in the spring of}} 1964 by Lockheed. After four more months of checkouts and static tests, the aircraft was shipped to Groom Lake and reassembled.

When the D-21/M-21 reached the launch point, the first step would be to blow off the D-21's inlet and exhaust covers. With the D-21/M-21 at the <b>correct</b> <b>speed</b> and altitude, the LCO would start the ramjet and the other systems of the D-21.

50|$|Most {{turbines}} however, are subsonic devices, {{the highest}} Mach number at the NGV throat being about 0.85.

50|$|Working {{lines are}} {{difficult}} to see on a conventional turbine map because the speed lines bunch up.

50|$|At low intake {{temperature}}s, {{the engine}} tends {{to operate at}} maximum <b>corrected</b> <b>speed</b> or <b>corrected</b> flow.

At even higher intake temperatures, a limit on compressor delivery temperature (T3) is invoked, which decreases both SOT and corrected flow.|$|R
2500|$|Another LED/photo-transistor pair {{located near}} the center of the disk detects the index hole once per {{rotation}} in the magnetic disk; it is used to detect the angular start of each track [...] and whether or not the disk is rotating at the <b>correct</b> <b>speed.</b> Early 8‚Äëinch and 5¬º‚Äëinch disks had physical holes for each sector and were termed hard sectored disks. Later soft-sectored disks have only one index hole, and sector position is determined by the disk controller or low-level software from patterns marking the start of a sector. Generally, the same drives are used to read and write both types of disks, with only the disks and controllers differing. Some operating systems utilizing soft sectors, such as Apple DOS, do not use the index hole; the drives designed for such systems often lack the corresponding sensor; this was mainly a hardware cost-saving measure.|$|E

The second wave was launched an hour later, as the convoy turned back at full speed. The wind backed from southwest to southeast, hampering the eastward path of the aircraft. Near the Galite Islands, a Short Sunderland flying boat met them to lead the formation to Malta. Two Hurricanes were lost after running out of fuel at 09:08 and 09:12. One of the pilots was rescued by the Sunderland, the other was never found. Eventually, the four remaining Hurricanes and the Skua landed at Luqa at 09:20.|$|E
2500|$|Mechanical disc strobe tuners are expensive, bulky, delicate, {{and require}} {{periodic}} maintenance (keeping the motor that spins the disc at the <b>correct</b> <b>speed,</b> replacing the strobing LED backlight, etc.). For many, a mechanical strobe tuner {{is simply not}} practical for one {{or all of the}} above reasons. To address these issues, in 2001 Peterson Tuners added a line of non-mechanical electronic strobe tuners that have LCD dot-matrix displays mimicking a mechanical strobe disc display, giving a stroboscopic effect. In 2004 Peterson made a model of LCD strobe in a sturdy floor based [...] "stomp box" [...] for live on-stage use. Virtual strobe tuners are as accurate as standard mechanical disc strobe tuners. However, there are limitations to the virtual system compared to the disc strobes. Virtual strobes display fewer bands to read note information, and do not pick up harmonic partials like a disc strobe. Rather, each band on a virtual strobe represents octaves of the fundamental. A disc strobe provides [...] "one band correspondence"‚Äîeach band displays a particular frequency of the note being played. On the virtual strobe system, each band combines a few close frequencies for easier reading on the LCD. This is still extremely accurate for intoning and tuning most instruments‚Äîbut, as of this writing, no virtual strobe tuner provides detailed information on partials.|$|E
50|$|During the Complex Off-design calculation, the {{operating}} {{point on the}} compressor map is constantly being guessed (in terms of '''''' and '''''') to obtain {{an estimate of the}} compressor mass flow, pressure ratio and efficiency.

The estimated turbine <b>corrected</b> <b>speed</b> and enthalpy drop/inlet temperature parameters are used to obtain, from the turbine map, an estimate of the turbine corrected flow ('''''')and efficiency (i.e. '''''').

The results illustrate that the single neuron control algorithm with gain adaptive has strong robustness, self-learning and anti-jamming capability {{and the performance of}} a turbofan engine can be effectively improved by using the turbine expansion ratio adaptive control law.
