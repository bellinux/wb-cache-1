40|$|Background: As various implant {{geometries}} present different biomechanical behaviors, {{the purpose}} of this work was to study stress distribution around tapered and cylindrical threaded implant geometries using three-dimensional finite element stress analysis. Methods : Seven implant models were constructed using <b>Computer</b> <b>Assisted</b> <b>Designing</b> system. After digitized models of mandibular section, the crowns were created. They were combined with implant models, which were previously imported into CATIA software. The combined solid model was transferred to ABAQOUS to create a finite element meshed model which was later analyzed regarding the highest maximum and minimum principal stresses of bone. Results: For all models, the highest stresses of cortical bone were located at the crestal cortical bone around the implant. Threaded implants, triangular thread form and taper body form showed a higher peak of tensile and compressive stress than non-threaded implants, square thread form and straight body form, respectively. A taper implant with triangular threads, which is doubled in the cervical portion of the body, had a significantly lower peak of tensile and compressive stress in the cortical bone than straight/taper triangular or square threaded implant forms. Conclusion: For the investigation of bone implant interfacial stress, the non-bonded state should be studied too. Confirmative clinical and biological studies are required in order to benefit from the results of this study...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} and compare the flexural strength and microhardness of provisional restorative materials fabricated utilizing rapid prototyping (RP), <b>Computer</b> <b>Assisted</b> <b>Designing</b> and <b>Computer</b> <b>Assisted</b> Milling (CAD-CAM) and conventional method. Materials and Methods: Twenty specimens of dimensions 25 mm × 2 mm × 2 mm (ADA-ANSI specification # 27) were fabricated each using: (1) Three dimensional (3 D) printed light-cured micro-hybrid filled composite by RP resin group, (2) a milled polymethyl methacrylate (CH) using CAD-CAM (CC resin group), and (3) a conventionally fabricated heat activated polymerized CH resin group. Flexural strength and microhardness were measured and values obtained were evaluated. Results: The measured mean flexural strength values (MegaPascals) were 79. 54 (RP resin group), 104. 20 (CC resin group), and 95. 58 (CH resin group). The measured mean microhardness values (Knoop hardness number) were 32. 77 (RP resin group), 25. 33 (CC resin group), and 27. 36 (CH resin group). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) test shows that there is statistically significant difference in the flexural strength values of the three groups (P < 0. 05). According to the pairwise comparison of Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD) test, flexural strength values of CC resin group and CH resin group were higher and statistically significant than those of the RP resin group (P < 0. 05). However, there was no significant difference between flexural strength values of CC resin and CH resin group (P = 0. 64). The difference in microhardness values of the three groups was statistically significant according to ANOVA as well as the intergroup comparison done using the Tukey's HSD (post oc) test (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: CC-based CH had the highest flexural strength whereas RP-based 3 D printed and light cured micro-hybrid filled composite had the highest microhardness...|$|R
