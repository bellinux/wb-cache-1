40|$|Recent {{high price}} of copper in global market forced the heat, ventilation, and air {{condition}} (HVAC) industry players to fi nd alternative materials with relatively lower market price compared to copper such as aluminium for replacement. This study characterizes tensile properties and strain response of new Cu-Al bi-metal tubes i. e. aluminium cladded copper (ACC) and <b>copper</b> <b>cladded</b> aluminium (CCA) in order {{to look at the}} possibility of applying the bi-metal tubes in HVAC industries. The result shows that tensile properties of CCA tubes was higher than that of ACC bi-metal tubes in two different strain rates of 1 × 10 - 3 and 1 × 10 - 1 sec- 1. Also, Strain response refers to the sample elongation at break shows a higher elongation value of CCA samples compared to ACC...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAluminum and <b>copper</b> <b>clad</b> ingots {{have gained}} great {{attention}} because its versatility to wide application areas, such as brazing sheet, light weight electrical wire and clad plate. In general, clad sheet and wire can be fabricated by rolling bonding or adhesive bonding. However these processes require complicated pre-treatment and processing and its processing cost is high. In this study, casting of aluminum and <b>copper</b> <b>clad</b> ingot was suggested and integrated by modification of {{direct chill casting}} and horizontal casting. Key parameter for successful interface bonding was precise control of cooling rate in the mould divider. To improve the bonding behavior and microstructure of clad ingot, electromagnetic stirring was applied during continuous casting process. By applying electromagnetic stirring, the interface bonding of clad ingot was improved with refined microstructure. In result, uniform and strongly bonded aluminum and <b>copper</b> <b>clad</b> ingot was fabricated under electromagnetic field. Finally preliminary study of rolling and extrusion of clad ingots were conducted and it shows promising results for fabrication of clad sheets and wire...|$|R
