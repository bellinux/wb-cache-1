5|$|Most of the book's {{scientific}} chapters {{were reviewed}} by scientists with relevant expertise, among whom <b>Carson</b> found strong support. <b>Carson</b> attended the White House Conference on Conservation in May 1962; Houghton Mifflin distributed proof copies of Silent Spring {{to many of}} the delegates, and promoted the upcoming New Yorker serialization. Among many others, <b>Carson</b> also sent a proof copy to Supreme Court Associate Justice William O. Douglas, a long-time environmental advocate who had argued against the court's rejection of the Long Island pesticide spraying case (and who had provided <b>Carson</b> with some of the material included in her chapter on herbicides).|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} roads used by Europeans {{to cross}} the Sierra Nevada into California were branches of the California Trail. The first route near the present US 50 was the <b>Carson</b> Route, laid out in 1848 by an eastward Mormon party that wanted to avoid the Truckee Route and its deep crossings of the Truckee River. The group left Pleasant Valley, southeast of Placerville, on July 3, following Iron Mountain Ridge up to {{the crest of the}} Sierra at <b>Carson</b> Pass and then descending through <b>Carson</b> Canyon into the <b>Carson</b> Valley. Along the Humboldt River in Nevada, the Mormons met Joseph B. Chiles, who was leading a westward wagon train to California, and told him of their new trail. Although this new <b>Carson</b> Route crossed two summits— <b>Carson</b> Pass over the crest of the Sierra and West Pass over the <b>Carson</b> Spur just to the west, these crossings were easier than Donner Pass on the Truckee Route, and only three fords of the <b>Carson</b> River were required. The route became the primary westward route into California {{at the start of the}} Gold Rush. Through California, the general alignment of the <b>Carson</b> Route, in terms of today's highways, was State Route 88 over <b>Carson</b> Pass and Mormon Emigrant Trail and Sly Park Road to Pleasant Valley.|$|E

5|$|After {{her first}} year of {{graduate}} school, <b>Carson</b> became a part-time student, taking an assistantship in Raymond Pearl's laboratory, where she worked with rats and Drosophila, to earn money for tuition. After false starts with pit vipers and squirrels, she completed a dissertation project on the embryonic development of the pronephros in fish. She earned a master's degree in zoology in June 1932. She had intended to continue for a doctorate, but in 1934 <b>Carson</b> {{was forced to leave}} Johns Hopkins to search for a full-time teaching position to help support her family. In 1935, her father died suddenly, worsening their already critical financial situation and leaving <b>Carson</b> to care for her aging mother. At the urging of her undergraduate biology mentor Mary Scott Skinker, she settled for a temporary position with the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, writing radio copy for a series of weekly educational broadcasts entitled Romance Under the Waters. The series of fifty-two seven minute programs focused on aquatic life and was intended to generate public interest in fish biology and {{in the work of the}} bureau—a task the several writers before <b>Carson</b> had not managed. <b>Carson</b> also began submitting articles on marine life in the Chesapeake Bay, based on her research for the series, to local newspapers and magazines.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 1940s, NBC {{broadcast}} {{coverage from}} Times Square anchored by Ben Grauer on both radio and television. Its coverage was later incorporated into special episodes of The Tonight Show, continuing through Johnny <b>Carson</b> and Jay Leno's tenures on the program. NBC would introduce a dedicated special, New Year's Eve with <b>Carson</b> Daly, beginning in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Besides poets, at {{high school}} Lewis met Sophie <b>Carson,</b> who {{eventually}} became his wife. Klein, their mutual friend, introduced them. <b>Carson</b> came from a religious Jewish family. Her father did not approve of Lewis, {{because he was a}} recent immigrant to Canada, and in Carson's father's opinion had little to no possibility of success.|$|E
5|$|Bud <b>Carson</b> was Tech's {{defensive}} coordinator in 1966. His {{job was to}} appease the massive Tech fan base Bobby Dodd had accumulated. <b>Carson</b> was not the charismatic leader like Dodd but rather a strategy man that enjoyed intense game planning. Carson's most notable achievements included recruiting Tech's first ever African American scholarship athlete and being the first Tech head coach to be fired.|$|E
5|$|<b>Carson</b> and {{the others}} {{involved}} with publication of Silent Spring expected fierce criticism. They were particularly concerned {{about the possibility of}} being sued for libel. <b>Carson</b> was also undergoing radiation therapy to combat her spreading cancer, and expected to have little energy to devote to defending her work and responding to critics. In preparation for the anticipated attacks, <b>Carson</b> and her agent attempted to amass as many prominent supporters as possible before the book's release.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} years of the law school, {{enrollment}} fluctuated from as many as 17 graduates in 1898 to as few as zero graduates in 1903 and 1905. Dean Ramsey resigned in 1888 and was replaced by George G. Bingham, who served until 1891 when replaced by his pupil Samuel T. Richardson. Women were allowed to enroll beginning in 1892; in 1898, the first women, Olive S. England and Gabrielle Clark, graduated. The third female graduate, in 1899, was Anna <b>Carson,</b> who was part of the <b>Carson</b> legal family of Salem that includes Wallace P. <b>Carson</b> (1923 graduate) a state legislator and Wallace P. <b>Carson,</b> Jr. (1962 graduate) a state legislator and longtime chief justice of the Oregon Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|John Calhoun Johnson of Placerville {{surveyed}} {{and cleared}} a shorter, lower (and thus less snow-covered) trail east from that town in 1852, completing the {{work by the}} summer. Rather than following the ridge to the Sierra's crest as the Mormons had, Johnson headed eastward to the South Fork American River, crossing to its north side near the present Pacific Ranger Station in order to follow Peavine Ridge around a rocky stretch of the river. Returning to the river between Kyburz and Strawberry, he then continued alongside it to the crest at Johnson Pass, where a steep slope descended to Lake Tahoe. Within Nevada, his route generally followed the lake to Glenbrook, where it turned inland and crossed the <b>Carson</b> Range over Spooner Summit into the <b>Carson</b> Valley near <b>Carson</b> City. This trail, known as Johnson's Cut-off, generally followed the present US 50, with notable deviations only just east of Placerville (via <b>Carson</b> Road), over Peavine Ridge (roughly following Peavine Ridge Road, some trails, and Wrights Lake Road), just east of Strawberry (via Slippery Ford Road), over {{the crest of the}} Sierra (via Johnson Pass Road and Meyers Road), south of Lake Tahoe (via Pioneer Trail), east of Lake Tahoe (via Genoa Peak Road), and from Spooner Summit into the <b>Carson</b> Valley (via Kings Canyon Road). By 1854, Bartlett's Bridge had been built at the trail's westernmost crossing of the American River, allowing wagons to follow the cutoff; it was soon washed away by a freshet on March 7, 1855, and replaced by Brockliss Bridge, several miles to the east. Due to an improvement of the road through <b>Carson</b> Canyon on the old <b>Carson</b> Route, most travelers ended up turning southeast from Johnson Pass over Luther Pass (present SR 89) to join the older route northeast of <b>Carson</b> Pass rather than following the cutoff along Lake Tahoe.|$|E

He was an ever-present as they finished eighth, conceding 35 goals in 34 matches, the fifth-lowest in the 2011–12 Süper Lig season. He also received a runner-up medal for the 2011–12 Turkish Cup.|$|E
5|$|On offense, Joe Morris {{had another}} {{standout}} season in 1986, rushing for 1,516yards, scoring 14 touchdowns and making his 2nd straight Pro Bowl. Also making the Pro Bowl were Bavaro, who caught 66 passes for 1,001yards, <b>Carson,</b> Jim Burt, Leonard Marshall, and Brad Benson, giving the Giants seven representatives. For Taylor and <b>Carson</b> the Pro Bowl berths marked their sixth straight selections.|$|E

5|$|Research at the Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health brought <b>Carson</b> {{into contact}} with medical {{researchers}} investigating the gamut of cancer-causing chemicals. Of particular significance {{was the work of}} National Cancer Institute researcher and environmental cancer section founding director Wilhelm Hueper, who classified many pesticides as carcinogens. <b>Carson</b> and her research assistant Jeanne Davis, with the help of NIH librarian Dorothy Algire, found evidence to support the pesticide-cancer connection; to <b>Carson</b> the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides was clear-cut, though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the small community of scientists studying pesticide carcinogenesis.|$|E
5|$|The Audubon Naturalist Society also {{actively}} opposed such spraying programs, and recruited <b>Carson</b> to {{help make}} public the government's exact spraying practices and the related research. <b>Carson</b> began the four-year project of what would become Silent Spring by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT. She also attempted to enlist others to join the cause: essayist E. B. White, {{and a number of}} journalists and scientists. By 1958, <b>Carson</b> had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with Newsweek science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when The New Yorker commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from <b>Carson,</b> she began considering writing more than simply the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon it was a solo project. (Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of Silent Spring).|$|E

5|$|There are sixteen {{counties}} and one independent {{city in the}} U.S. state of Nevada. On November 25, 1861, the first Nevada Territorial Legislature established nine counties.

In 1969, Ormsby County and <b>Carson</b> City were consolidated into a single municipal government known as <b>Carson</b> City.|$|E
5|$|When Johnny <b>Carson,</b> {{a fan of}} jazz music, was {{preparing}} to take over as the permanent host of The Tonight Show starting in October 1962, he recognized that he would need a theme song. <b>Carson</b> and Anka had worked together in England on the television special An Evening with Paul Anka in 1961; when they happened to meet up again in New York City the following year, <b>Carson</b> manager Al Bruno mentioned needing a theme.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} groups ranging from {{government}} institutions to environmental and conservation organizations to scholarly societies have celebrated Carson's {{life and work}} since her death. Perhaps most significantly, on June 9, 1980, <b>Carson</b> was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. A 17¢ Great Americans series postage stamp was issued in her honor the following year; several other countries have since issued <b>Carson</b> postage as well.|$|E
5|$|Across the {{remaining}} networks, NBC broadcasts New Year's Eve with <b>Carson</b> Daly, hosted from Times Square by <b>Carson</b> Daly of The Voice and Last Call, and Spanish-language network Univision broadcasts Feliz!, hosted from Times Square by Raúl de Molina of El Gordo y La Flaca. On cable, CNN carries {{coverage of the}} festivities, known as New Year's Eve Live, which had been hosted by Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen from Times Square.

5|$|As her {{research}} progressed, <b>Carson</b> found a sizable community of scientists who were documenting the physiological and {{environmental effects of}} pesticides. She also took advantage of her personal connections with many government scientists, who supplied her with confidential information. From reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, <b>Carson</b> found two scientific camps {{when it came to}} pesticides: those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof, and those who were open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative methods such as biological pest control.|$|E
5|$|<b>Carson</b> {{first met}} Dorothy Freeman in the Summer of 1953 in Southport Island, Maine. Freeman {{had written to}} <b>Carson</b> {{welcoming}} her to the area when she had heard that the famous author was to become her neighbor. It {{was the beginning of}} an extremely close friendship that would last the rest of Carson's life. Their relationship was conducted mainly through letters, and during summers spent together in Maine. Over the course of 12 years, they would exchange somewhere in the region of 900 letters. Many of these were published in the book Always, Rachel, published in 1995 by Beacon Press.|$|E
5|$|<b>Carson</b> {{made only}} four {{appearances}} in the 2005–06 season, all in cup competitions, and in March 2006, was allowed to move to Sheffield Wednesday on loan. Wednesday sought his services to help solve their goalkeeping crisis, while <b>Carson</b> was looking to gain more first team experience and to challenge for {{a place in the}} England 2006 FIFA World Cup squad. He kept five clean sheets in nine appearances for Wednesday, whose assistant manager Kevin Summerfield hailed his contribution as a key factor in helping the club escape relegation. He returned to Liverpool {{at the end of the}} season and in July 2006, extended his contract with Liverpool until 2011.|$|E
5|$|<b>Carson</b> rose {{within the}} Fish and Wildlife Service, by 1945 supervising a small writing staff and in 1949 {{becoming}} chief editor of publications. Though her position provided increasing opportunities for fieldwork and freedom in choosing her writing projects, it also entailed increasingly tedious administrative responsibilities. By 1948, <b>Carson</b> {{was working on}} material for a second book, and had made the conscious decision to begin a transition to writing full-time. That year, she took on a literary agent, Marie Rodell; they formed a close professional relationship that would last the rest of Carson's career.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1957, family tragedy {{struck a}} third time {{when one of the}} nieces she had cared for in the 1940s {{died at the age of}} 31, leaving a five-year-old orphan son, Roger Christie. <b>Carson</b> took on that responsibility, {{adopting}} the boy, alongside caring for her aging mother. This took a considerable toll on <b>Carson.</b> She moved to Silver Spring, Maryland, to care for Roger, and much of 1957 was spent putting their new living situation in order and focusing on specific environmental threats.|$|E
5|$|In May 2005, {{while still}} {{a member of}} the under-21 team, <b>Carson</b> was called up to the England senior team squad for the team's tour of the United States later that month. A year later, he came on as {{substitute}} for Robert Green, who had suffered a serious injury, in the England B international friendly against Belarus in May 2006. The injury to Green, who had been named in the England squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, led to <b>Carson,</b> who was on standby, being promoted to the England squad for the tournament, although he did not make any appearances. <b>Carson</b> continued to be selected for the England senior team squad, and in May 2007, made his second appearance for the England B team in a 3–1 win over Albania. Following the 2007 UEFA Under-21 Championships, he made his full England debut in a friendly against Austria in November 2007 when he kept a clean sheet. A week later, he made his competitive debut in a crucial match against Croatia, which England lost 3–2, resulting in their failure to qualify for UEFA Euro 2008. <b>Carson</b> was held particularly culpable for the first goal, when Niko Kranjčar's speculative shot from 30 yards dipped and bounced in front of him, with <b>Carson</b> only succeeding in parrying the ball into the net. England coach Steve McClaren was sacked the next day, as commentators criticised McClaren for selecting an inexperienced goalkeeper for the match.|$|E
