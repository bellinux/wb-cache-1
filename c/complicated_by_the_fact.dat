5|$|A {{group in}} Cambridge, which {{met at the}} White Horse tavern from the mid-1520s and became known as Little Germany, soon became influential. Its members {{included}} Robert Barnes, Hugh Latimer, John Frith and Thomas Bilney—all eventually burned as heretics. Cranmer's change of mind, borne partly by his membership of the team negotiating for the annulment, finally came through his stay with Andreas Osiander in Nuremberg in 1532. (Cranmer also secretly married Osiander's niece). Even then the position was <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Lutherans were not in favour of the annulment.

In his biographical work Agricola, Tacitus maintains that Agricola was forced into retirement because his triumph over the Caledonians highlighted Domitian's own inadequacy as a military commander. Several modern authors such as Dorey have argued the opposite: that Agricola was in fact a close friend of Domitian, and that Tacitus merely sought to distance his family from the fallen dynasty once Nerva was in power.|$|E

40|$|Arguments {{regarding}} {{trade and}} other forms of liberalization in developing countries are reviewed. Microeconomically, the standard case for liberalization is dubious under increasing returns to scale and when firms can invest directly in productivity enhancement. Distributional effects of commercial policy changes can be regressive and large, but the "rents" they generate can serve as a basis for effective policy intervention contingent on firms' performance. Macroeconomically, the case of liberalization rests on Say's Law, which is not always enforced. It is <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that recent combined current and capital market liberalizations have been associated with strong exchange rates and high interest rates, and that output and productivity growth have positive mutual feedbacks which liberalization may well suppress.

5|$|Ascocoryne sarcoides is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Helotiaceae. The species name {{is derived from the}} Greek sarkodes (fleshy). Formerly known as Coryne sarcoides, its taxonomical history has been <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that it may adopt both sexual and asexual forms. Colloquially known as jelly drops or the purple jellydisc, this common fungus appears as a {{gelatinous}} mass of pinkish or purple-colored discs. Distributed widely in North America, Europe and Asia, A.sarcoides is a saprobic fungus and grows in clusters on the trunks and branches of a variety of dead woods. Field studies suggest that colonization by A.sarcoides of the heartwood of black spruce confers some resistance to further infection by rot-causing fungi. A.sarcoides contains the antibiotic compound ascocorynin, shown in the laboratory to inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage for {{aircraft}} is <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the aircraft's background varies widely, {{depending on the}} location of the observer, the nature of the background and the aircraft's motion. For this reason, military aircraft were often painted to match the sky when viewed from below, and to either match the ground or break up the aircraft's outline when viewed from above. This is a form of countershading, likely to work best on aircraft such as heavy bombers that do not do fly inverted during combat. Because of the way light hits it, patterns of dark and light will often be present on an aircraft even if it is entirely one color, making it easier to see Reflections and specular highlights can be counteracted by painting an aircraft in neutral shades with a non-reflective, matte finish. There is a trade-off between the effectiveness of camouflage and the size of recognition markings: larger markings reduce the risk of friendly fire through misrecognition, but compromise camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Clouds {{typically}} cover 1% of Titan's disk, though outburst {{events have}} been observed in which the cloud cover rapidly expands {{to as much as}} 8%. One hypothesis asserts that the southern clouds are formed when heightened levels of sunlight during the southern summer generate uplift in the atmosphere, resulting in convection. This explanation is <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that cloud formation has been observed not only after the southern summer solstice but also during mid-spring. Increased methane humidity at the south pole possibly contributes to the rapid increases in cloud size. It was summer in Titan's southern hemisphere until 2010, when Saturn's orbit, which governs Titan's motion, moved Titan's northern hemisphere into the sunlight. When the seasons switch, it is expected that ethane will begin to condense over the south pole.|$|E

5|$|Greenlandic verbs inflect for {{agreement}} with agent and patient, for mood and for voice. There are eight moods, of which four {{are used in}} independent clauses and four in subordinate clauses. The four independent moods are: indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative. The four dependent moods are causative, conditional, contemporative, and participial. Verbal roots can take transitive, intransitive or negative inflections, so that all eight mood suffixes have these three forms. The inflectional system is further <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that transitive suffixes encode both agent and patient in a single morpheme, requiring up to 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of agent and patient {{for each of the}} eight transitive paradigms. As some moods do not have forms for all persons (imperative only has 2nd person, optative only 1st and 3rd person, participial mood has no 4th person and contemporative has no 3rd person), the total number of verbal inflectional suffixes is about 318.|$|E

40|$|Mapping {{quantitative}} trait loci (QTL) {{is to identify}} molecular markers or genomic loci that influence the variation of complex traits. <b>The</b> problem is <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that QTL data usually contain {{a large number of}} markers across the entire genome and most of them have little or no effect on the phenotype. In this paper, we propose several Bayesian hierarchical models for mapping multiple QTL that simultaneously fit and estimate all possible genetic effects associated with all markers. The proposed models use prior distributions for the genetic effects that are scale mixtures of normal distributions with mean zero and variances distributed to give each effect a high probability of being near zero. We consider two types of priors for the variances, 2 exponential and scaled inverse- χ distributions, which result in Bayesian version of the popular LASSO model and the well-known Student-t model, respectively. Unlike most applications where fixed values are preset for hyperparameters in the priors, we treat all hyperparameters as unknowns and estimate them along with other parameters.

40|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) has remained {{one of the}} most baffling autoimmune rheumatic diseases since it was described in the 19 th century. It is a multisystemic, chronic condition that affects individuals with life-threatening irreversible end-organ damage and debilitating clinical features. The course of SLE varies from periods of quiescence to ones of exacerbation that may involve any organ system in almost any combination. In particular, SLE typically attacks young women at their childbearing years, which makes the therapeutic goals and pharmacological management challenging. The management of patients with SLE in Asia is further <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that these patients tend to have a more severe disease, do not have ready access to medical treatment, are not able to afford expensive drugs, especially novel immunosuppressive and biologic agents, and are more susceptible to serious infective complications.

The situation was further <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Mestwin II gained the rule over all the Duchy of Pomerelia after a war against his uncles, Racibor and Sambor II, who in revenge for this willed his possessions (including Białogard and Gniew) to the Teutonic Order upon his death in 1278.|$|E
5|$|The taxonomical {{history of}} this fungus has been <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that its life cycle allows for both an {{imperfect}} (making asexual spores, or conidia) or perfect (making sexual spores) form; at various times authors have assigned names to {{one or the other}} form, but these names have often been at odds with the accepted rules of fungal nomenclature. It was originally described in 1781 by the Dutch scientist Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin as Lichen sarcoides. Christian Hendrik Persoon called it Peziza sarcoides in 1801. Elias Magnus Fries, in his 1822 publication Systema Mycologicum, described the imperfect state of the fungus under the name Tremella sarcoides. The genus name Coryne was first used in 1851 by Bonorden, who proposed Coryne sarcoides for the imperfect state; in 1865 the Tulasne brothers (Charles and Louis René) used Coryne to refer to both the perfect and imperfect forms. It was designated the type species for the genus in a 1931 publication by Clements and Shear.|$|E
