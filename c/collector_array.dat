40|$|An {{analytical}} {{comparison of}} the efficiency of solar thermal <b>collector</b> <b>arrays</b> with and without external manifolds is reported. A FORTRAN computer program was written for the computation of the thermal performance of solar thermal <b>collector</b> <b>arrays</b> with and without external manifolds. Arrays constructed from two example solar thermal collectors are computated. Typical external manifold sizes and thermal insulations are presented graphically and are compared with the thermal performance of the collector alone...|$|R
50|$|Following {{completion}} of the collection phase, the <b>collector</b> <b>arrays</b> were stowed in a sample return capsule, and the spacecraft returned to Earth. As the capsule was approaching Earth and at the first stages of re-entry, all appeared well.|$|R
50|$|It also replaces {{titanium}} in applications {{ranging from}} medical instruments and cars {{to the military}} and aerospace industry. In military applications, rods of amorphous metals replace depleted uranium in kinetic energy penetrators. Plates of Liquidmetal {{were used in the}} solar wind ion <b>collector</b> <b>array</b> in the Genesis space probe.|$|E
50|$|A <b>collector</b> <b>array</b> {{may be used}} {{to collect}} {{millions}} or billions of atoms, molecules, and fine particulates by using a number of wafers made of different elements. The molecular structure of these wafers allows the collection of various sizes of particles. Collector arrays, such as those flown on Genesis, are ultra-pure in order to ensure maximal collection efficiency, durability, and analytical distinguishability.|$|E
50|$|A sample-return {{mission is}} a {{spacecraft}} mission {{with the goal}} of collecting and returning with tangible samples from an extraterrestrial location to Earth for analysis. Sample-return missions may bring back merely atoms and molecules or a deposit of complex compounds such as loose material ("soil") and rocks. These samples may be obtained in a number of ways, including a <b>collector</b> <b>array</b> used for capturing particles of solar wind or cometary debris, soil and rock excavation, mining, and any other possible way for retrieving samples in the environment.|$|E
40|$|Solar {{thermal energy}} {{collection}} at seven sites is calculated for air and vacuum flat plate collectors and a vacuum collector using cylindrical Winston concentration. The hourly intensity and angular distribution of solar radiation is predicted for the calcula-tions using insolation measurements and an insolation model. Tracking configurations include two-axis, vertical axis, polar axis and east-west axis tracking. Fixed <b>collector</b> <b>arrays</b> are all tilted towards the equator at the latitude angle. These calculations indicate energy collection varies linearly with cloudiness index KT. Diffuse radiation is a 15 % of energy collected by concentrating <b>collector</b> <b>arrays</b> at low operating temperatures where large acceptance angles maximize energy collection. Smaller acceptance angles, required to maximize collection at higher operating temperatures, eliminate {{the advantage of}} Winston concentration for tracking arrays. Absorbers with high selectivity are neces-sary for high efficiency of fixed evacuated collectors at higher operating temperatures. Ratios of tracking to fixed collector energy collection increase rapidly between a 200 °C and a 300 °C making it likely that tracking becomes economically viable in this temperature range. These results are easily extended to other cylindrical concentrating collectors...|$|R
50|$|Due to cheap land prices, in the Nordic {{countries}} new <b>collector</b> <b>arrays</b> are ground-mounted (concrete foundations or pile-driven steel) in suitable areas (low-yield agricultural, industry etc.). Countries {{with high}} ground prices tend to place solar collectors on building roofs, following the 'block plant' variant of CSHPs. In Northern Europe, 20% solar heat of annual heating requirement is the economic optimum {{in a district}} heating plant when using above-ground storage tanks. If pond storage is used, the solar contribution can reach 50%.|$|R
50|$|Heat pipes {{are also}} {{widely used in}} solar thermal water heating {{applications}} in combination with evacuated tube solar <b>collector</b> <b>arrays.</b> In these applications, distilled water is commonly used as the heat transfer fluid inside a sealed length of copper tubing that is located within an evacuated glass tube and oriented towards the sun. In connecting pipes, the heat transport occurs in the liquid steam phase because the thermal transfer medium is converted into steam in a large section of the collecting pipeline.|$|R
50|$|The next {{mission to}} return {{extraterrestrial}} samples {{was known as}} Genesis - {{it was able to}} return solar wind samples to Earth from beyond Earth orbit. Unfortunately, the Genesis capsule failed to open its parachute while re-entering the Earth's atmosphere and crash-landed in the Utah desert in 2004. There were fears of severe contamination or even total mission loss, but scientists have managed to save many of the samples, which were the first to be collected from beyond lunar orbit. Genesis used a <b>collector</b> <b>array</b> made of wafers of ultra-pure silicon, gold, sapphire, and diamond. Each different wafer was used to collect {{a different part of the}} solar wind.Genesis was followed by NASA's Stardust spacecraft, which returned comet samples to Earth on January 15, 2006. It safely passed by Comet Wild 2 and collected dust samples from the comet's coma while imaging the comet's nucleus. Stardust used a <b>collector</b> <b>array</b> made of low-density aerogel (99% of which is empty space), which has about 1/1000 of the density of glass. This permits the ability to collect the cometary particles without damaging them due to high impact velocities. Particle collisions with even slightly porous solid collectors would result in destruction of those particles and damage to the collection apparatus. During cruise, the second side of the array collected at least seven interstellar dust particles.|$|E
50|$|Collector arrays {{are useful}} for {{collecting}} tiny, fast-moving atoms such as those expelled by the Sun through solar wind, but {{can also be used}} for collection of larger particles such as those found in the coma of a comet. The NASA spacecraft known as Stardust implemented this technique. However, due to the high speeds and size of the particles that make up the coma and the area nearby, a dense solid-state <b>collector</b> <b>array</b> was not viable. As a result, another means for collecting samples had to be designed as to preserve the safety of the spacecraft and the samples themselves.|$|E
50|$|The building's active {{solar heating}} system {{employed}} an 800 sq ft <b>collector</b> <b>array</b> on the south wall of the building, which was angled at 30 degrees to the vertical to catch {{the maximum amount of}} winter sunlight. Hot water from the collectors fed a 6,000-gallon insulated tank, which provided a reserve for nights and cloudy periods. Under normal conditions the water in the tank would be sufficiently warm to directly heat the building, but if the temperature in the tank dropped (e.g. due to prolonged cloudy weather), a heat pump could be employed to extract the remaining useful heat from the water stream.|$|E
40|$|This module engages {{students}} {{in the use of}} a clean room and in the planning of assembly of solar collector wafers for the Genesis space mission. They will work in production design teams to explore how the Genesis spacecraft will collect bulk solar wind with the <b>collector</b> <b>arrays</b> and learn to work as a team in a restrictive environment. The module includes several activities with accompanying video clips. Downloadable, printable teachers' guides and students pages are provided for each one. Educational levels: Middle school, High school...|$|R
5000|$|Most of the Genesis {{collectors}} continuously sampled all of {{the solar}} wind which the spacecraft encountered (the [...] "bulk solar wind"). However, the spacecraft also carried three <b>arrays</b> of <b>collectors</b> which were deployed when specific [...] "regimes" [...] (fast, slow, coronal mass ejections) of solar wind were encountered, {{as determined by the}} electron and ion monitors on board. These deployable <b>collector</b> <b>arrays</b> were designed to provide data to test the hypothesis that the rock-forming elements keep their relative proportions throughout the processes which form the solar wind.|$|R
40|$|A solar {{adsorption}} {{cooling system}} {{which can be}} switched between a system with heat storage and a system without heat storage was designed. In the system with heat storage, a heat storage water tank was employed as {{the link between the}} solar collector circulation and the hot water circulation for the adsorption chillers. However, the heat storage water tank was isolated in the system without heat storage, and the hot water was directly circulated between the solar <b>collector</b> <b>arrays</b> and the adsorption chillers. It was found that the inlet and outlet temperatures for the solar <b>collector</b> <b>arrays</b> and the adsorption chillers in the system without heat storage were more fluctuant than those of the system with heat storage. Also found was that the system with heat storage operated stably because of the regulating effect by the heat storage water tank. However, under otherwise similar conditions, the cooling effect of the system without heat storage was {{similar to that of the}} system with heat storage. Compared with the system with heat storage, the system without heat storage has the advantages of higher solar collecting efficiency as well as higher electrical COP.

50|$|An astronomical {{interferometer}} is {{an array}} of separate telescopes, mirror segments, or radio telescope antennas that work together as a single telescope to provide higher resolution images of astronomical objects such as stars, nebulas and galaxies by means of interferometry. The advantage of this technique {{is that it can}} theoretically produce images with the angular resolution of a huge telescope with an aperture equal to the separation between the component telescopes. The main drawback {{is that it does not}} collect as much light as the complete instrument's mirror. Thus it is mainly useful for fine resolution of more luminous astronomical objects, such as close binary stars. Another drawback is that the maximum angular size of a detectable emission source is limited by the minimum gap between detectors in the <b>collector</b> <b>array.</b>|$|E
40|$|Low flow liquid {{desiccant}} systems {{offer new}} opportunities for solar cooling. Lossless storage of cooling {{energy in the form}} of concentrated desiccant is a key advantage in a solar application. A prototype liquid desiccant air conditioning system has been procured, operated, and simulated. Theory and performance data have suggested a high solar driving temperature. A simulation has been performed using a 100 m 2 evacuated tube <b>collector</b> <b>array.</b> Simulation results for 8 days in July show that storage of desiccant allows a smaller solar <b>collector</b> <b>array</b> to meet the fresh air dehumidification demand of 1500 L/s for a dedicated ventilation air system in Toronto, Ontario. Storage to meet this demand was calculated to be 300 L of LiCl solution...|$|E

40|$|The Genesis {{spacecraft}} has {{two primary}} instruments which passively collect solar wind. The {{first is the}} <b>collector</b> <b>arrays,</b> a set of panels, each of which can deploy separately to sample {{the different kinds of}} solar wind (regimes). The second is the concentrator, an electrostatic mirror which will concentrate ions of mass 4 through mass 25 by about a factor of 20 by focusing them onto a 6 cm diameter target. When not deployed, these instruments fit into a compact canister. After a two year exposure time, the deployed instruments can be folded up, sealed into the canister, and returned to earth for laboratory analysis.

Other materials are strategically placed on the spacecraft as additional targets of opportunity to maximize the area for solar-wind collection. Most of the collection area consists of hexagonal collectors in the arrays; approximately half are silicon, the rest are for solar-wind components not retained and/or not easily measured in silicon.

In this paper such patterned <b>collectors</b> <b>array</b> with changed electric field around, are introduced to TLES to deposit large-scale patterned nanofibers. The experiment results show that patterned nanofibers can be collected along the gap between plastic plates in both plastic-glass and plastic-silicon configuration. To the copper-glass collector, nanofibers bridge over the gap and the nanofiber quantity density on the gap is much less than that on the copper. But the patterned effects in all configurations are relatively weaker than that from foremetioned spinning due to their much higher speed, more serious bending instability and repulsive interactions between as-spun nanofibers...|$|R
