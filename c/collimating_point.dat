We first propose a general framework and show that eight different optical component design problems amount to solving a Light Energy Conservation equation that involves the computation of Visibility diagrams. We show that these diagrams all have the same structure and can be obtained by intersecting a 3 D Power Diagram with a planar or spherical domain. This allows us to propose an efficient and fully generic algorithm capable to solve the eight optical component design problems.

40|$|Highly {{collimated}} beams {{are required}} in numerous applications and techniques. Different {{methods have been}} proposed for <b>collimating</b> monochromatic <b>point</b> light sources during the recent years. In this work, we analyze how a finite size and polychromatic light source can be collimated using only one diffraction grating and a CMOS camera placed after the source and the collimating lens. For this, we determine {{the period of the}} fringes diffracted by the grating and compare it with the period of the grating. Analytical equations are obtained to predict the amplitude of the fringes and their period. Since self-images disappear for finite size polychromatic sources at long distances from the grating, the period has to be measured close to the grating. In addition, we give an analytical equation to determine the error in the positioning of the source in terms of the source size and the setup parameters. Finally, we experimentally corroborate the obtained analytical formalism using a white LED of size s = 0. 6 mm collimated by a lens with focal length f = 25 mm, and a Ronchi binary grating of period d = 250 mu m. In this case, we achieve an experimental error in the positioning of the source with respect to the focal plane of the lens of delta z(exp) = 92 mu m...|$|R

5000|$|The {{principle}} of parabolic reflectors {{has been known}} since classical antiquity, when the mathematician Diocles described them in his book On Burning Mirrors and proved that they focus a parallel beam to a point. [...] Archimedes in the third century BC studied paraboloids {{as part of his}} study of hydrostatic equilibrium, and it has been claimed that he used reflectors to set the Roman fleet alight during the Siege of Syracuse. [...] This seems unlikely to be true, however, as the claim does not appear in sources before the 2nd century AD, and Diocles does not mention it in his book. [...] Parabolic mirrors were also studied by the physicist Ibn Sahl in the 10th century. [...] James Gregory, in his 1663 book Optica Promota (1663), pointed out that a reflecting telescope with a mirror that was parabolic would correct spherical aberration as well as the chromatic aberration seen in refracting telescopes. The design he came up with bears his name: the [...] "Gregorian telescope"; but according to his own confession, Gregory had no practical skill and he could find no optician capable of actually constructing one. Isaac Newton knew about the properties of parabolic mirrors but chose a spherical shape for his Newtonian telescope mirror to simplify construction. Lighthouses also commonly used parabolic mirrors to <b>collimate</b> a <b>point</b> of light from a lantern into a beam, before being replaced by more efficient Fresnel lenses in the 19th century. In 1888, Heinrich Hertz, a German physicist, constructed the world's first parabolic reflector antenna.|$|R

Maps of continuum emission were made at 1300 km (25 A resolution), 1100 km (20 A resolution), 800 km (14 A resolution), and 450 km (14 A resolution). The M-band spectrum of IRS 3 has a velocity resolution of 5. 2 km s~ 1 and shows fundamental vibrational band absorption lines of CO and 13 CO over a range of rotational states. The CO map has numerous intensity peaks which, if interpreted as clumps, have masses from 0. 1 to 3 M _ The large velocity dispersion of these structures implies that they cannot be gravitationally bound. The brightest CO-emitting gas shows no bipolar distribution with velocity. Di†use CO-emitting gas with low velocities does have a generally bipolar distribution, but there are no <b>collimated</b> lobes <b>pointing</b> to a particular source.

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the efficiency of UV-C radiation as a non-thermal pasteurization process for liquid egg products (LEPs). The outcomes of this study were evaluated from the rheological, biodosimetric and inactivation efficiency points of view. The results pertaining to rheological characterization, physical and optical measurements of the fresh and pasteurized LEPs indicated that liquid whole egg (LWE) and liquid egg white (LEW) showed Newtonian behavior within the range studied. Liquid egg yolk (LEY) exhibited pseudoplastic and time independent behavior in temperature ranges from 4 C to 25 C. But its rheological behavior was affected at pasteurization temperature and showed thixotropy and time dependent. The biodosimetric study based on the UV treatment of LEPs by using <b>collimated</b> beam apparatus <b>pointed</b> out that the best reduction was achieved in liquid egg white (LEW) when the fluid depth and UV dose were 0. 153 cm and 98 mJ/cm 2, respectively. Maximum inactivation was 0. 675 -log CFU/ml in liquid egg yolk (LEY) and 0. 316 -log CFU/ml in liquid whole egg (LWE). The kinetics of UV inactivation of E. coli in LEPs was found nonlinear. Our results emphasize that UV-C radiation can be used as a pre-treatment process or combined with mild heat treatment to reduce the adverse effects of thermal pasteurization of LEPs. The efficacies of short wave ultraviolet light (UV-C) as a non-thermal process for LEW were investigated in the continuous flow UV reactor based on the result derived from the biodosimetric study. Maximum 0. 2 log reduction was achieved after 5 cycle of operation. The efficiency of the UV light treatment in continuous flow UV reactor was found to be lower compared to bench-top studies. This is attributed to the problems caused by inefficient design of UV chamber. Results of these work showed that the UV reactor was designed poorly to supply enough UV irradiation exposure for all the fluid elements in the system. Redesigning of the system was suggested...|$|R
40|$|As complex {{radiotherapy}} techniques {{become more}} readily-practiced, comprehensive 3 D dosimetry {{is a growing}} necessity for advanced quality assurance. However, clinical implementation has been impeded by {{a wide variety of}} factors, including the expense of dedicated optical dosimeter readout tools, high operational costs, and the overall difficulty of use. To address these issues, a novel dry-tank optical CT scanner was designed for PRESAGE 3 D dosimeter readout, relying on 3 D printed components and omitting costly parts from preceding optical scanners. This work details the design, prototyping, and basic commissioning of the Duke Integrated-lens Optical Scanner (DIOS). The convex scanning geometry was designed in ScanSim, an in-house Monte Carlo optical ray-tracing simulation. ScanSim parameters were used to build a 3 D rendering of a convex ‘solid tank’ for optical-CT, which is capable of <b>collimating</b> a <b>point</b> light source into telecentric geometry without significant quantities of refractive-index matched fluid. The model was 3 D printed, processed, and converted into a negative mold via rubber casting to produce a transparent polyurethane scanning tank. The DIOS was assembled with the solid tank, a 3 W red LED light source, a computer-controlled rotation stage, and a 12 -bit CCD camera. Initial optical phantom studies show negligible spatial inaccuracies in 2 D projection images and 3 D tomographic reconstructions. A PRESAGE 3 D dose measurement for a 4 -field box treatment plan from Eclipse shows 95 % of voxels passing gamma analysis at 3 %/ 3 mm criteria. Gamma analysis between tomographic images of the same dosimeter in the DIOS and DLOS systems show 93. 1 % agreement at 5 %/ 1 mm criteria. From this initial study, the DIOS has demonstrated promise as an economically-viable optical-CT scanner. However, further improvements will be necessary to fully develop this system into an accurate and reliable tool for advanced QA. Pre-clinical animal studies are used as a conventional means of translational research, as a midpoint between in-vitro cell studies and clinical implementation. However, modern small animal radiotherapy platforms are primitive in comparison with conventional linear accelerators. This work also investigates a series of 3 D printed tools to expand the treatment capabilities of the X-RAD 225 Cx orthovoltage irradiator, and applies them to a feasibility study of hippocampal avoidance in rodent whole-brain radiotherapy. As an alternative material to lead, a novel 3 D-printable tungsten-composite ABS plastic, GMASS, was tested to create precisely-shaped blocks. Film studies show virtually all primary radiation at 225 kVp can be attenuated by GMASS blocks of 0. 5 cm thickness. A state-of-the-art software, BlockGen, was used to create custom hippocampus-shaped blocks from medical image data, for any possible axial treatment field arrangement. A custom 3 D printed bite block was developed to immobilize and position a supine rat for optimal hippocampal conformity. An immobilized rat CT with digitally-inserted blocks was imported into the SmART-Plan Monte-Carlo simulation software to determine the optimal beam arrangement. Protocols with 4 and 7 equally-spaced fields were considered as viable treatment options, featuring improved hippocampal conformity and whole-brain coverage when compared to prior lateral-opposed protocols. Custom rodent-morphic PRESAGE dosimeters were developed to accurately reflect these treatment scenarios, and a 3 D dosimetry study was performed to confirm the SmART-Plan simulations. Measured doses indicate significant hippocampal sparing and moderate whole-brain coverage. Thesi...|$|R
40|$|Using {{conventional}} mapping algorithms for {{the construction}} of illumination freeform optics’ arbitrary target pattern can be obtained for idealized sources, e. g. <b>collimated</b> light or <b>point</b> sources. Each freeform surface element generates an image point at the target and the light intensity of an image point is corresponding to the area of the freeform surface element who generates the image point. For sources with a pronounced extension and ray divergence, e. g. an LED with a small source-freeform-distance, the image points are blurred and the blurred patterns might be different between different points. Besides, due to Fresnel losses and vignetting, the relationship between light intensity of image points and area of freeform surface elements becomes complicated. These individual light distributions of each freeform element are taken into account in a mapping algorithm. To this end the method of steepest decent procedures are used to adapt the mapping goal. A structured target pattern for a optics system with an ideal source is computed applying corresponding linear optimization matrices. Special weighting factor and smoothing factor are included in the procedures to achieve certain edge conditions and to ensure the manufacturability of the freefrom surface. The corresponding linear optimization matrices, which are the lighting distribution patterns of each of the freeform surface elements, are gained by conventional raytracing with a realistic source. Nontrivial source geometries, like LED-irregularities due to bonding or source fine structures, and a complex ray divergence behavior can be easily considered. Additionally, Fresnel losses, vignetting and even stray light are taken into account. After optimization iterations, with a realistic source, the initial mapping goal can be achieved by the optics system providing a structured target pattern with an ideal source. The algorithm is applied to several design examples. A few simple tasks are presented to discussed the ability and limitation of the this mothed. It is also presented that a homogeneous LED-illumination system design, in where, with a strongly tilted incident direction, a homogeneous distribution is achieved with a rather compact optics system and short working distance applying a relatively large LED source. It is shown that the lighting distribution patterns from the freeform surface elements can be significantly different from the others. The generation of a structured target pattern, applying weighting factor and smoothing factor, are discussed. Finally, freeform designs for much more complex sources like clusters of LED-sources are presented...|$|R
40|$|An optical {{navigation}} system is being flown as the backup {{system to the}} primary Deep Space Network telemetry for navigation and guidance purposes on Orion. This is required to ensure Orion can recover from a loss of communication, which would simultaneously cause a loss of DSN telemetry. Images taken of the Moon and Earth are used to give range and position information to the navigation computer for trajectory calculations and maneuver execution. To get telemetry data from these images, the size and location of the moon need to be calculated with high accuracy and precision. The reentry envelope for the Orion EM- 1 mission requires the centroid and radius of the moon images to be determined within 1 / 3 of a pixel 3 sigma. In order to ensure this accuracy and precision can be attained, I was tasked with building precise dot grid images for camera calibration as well as building a {{hardware in the loop}} test stand for flight software and hardware proofing. To calibrate the Op-Nav camera a dot grid is imaged with the camera, the error between the image dot location and the actual dot location can be used to build a distortion map of the camera and lens system so that images can be fixed to display truth locations. To build the dot grid images I used the Electro Optics Lab optical bench Bright Object Simulator System, and gimbal. The gimbal was slewed to a series of elevations and azimuths. An image of the <b>collimated</b> single <b>point</b> light source was then taken at each position. After a series of 99 images were taken at different locations the single light spots were extracted from each image and added to a composite image containing all 99 points. During the development of these grids it was noticed that an intermittent error in the artificial "star" locations occurred. Prior to the summer this error was attributed to the gimbal having glitches in it's pointing direction and was going to be replaced, however after further examining the issue I determined it to be a software issue. I have since narrowed the likely source of the error down to a Software Development Kit released by the camera supplier PixeLink. I have since developed a workaround in order to build star grids for calibration until the software bug can be isolated and fixed. I was also tasked with building a Hardware in the Loop test stand in order to test the full Op-Nav system. A 4 k screen displays simulated Lunar and Terrestrial images from a possible Orion trajectory. These images are then projected through a collimator and then captured with an Op-Nav camera controlled by an Intel NUC computer running flight software. The flight software then analyzes the images to determine attitude and position, this data is then reconstructed into a trajectory and matched to the simulated trajectory {{in order to determine the}} accuracy of the attitude and position estimates. In order for the system to work it needs to be precisely and accurately aligned. I developed an alignment procedure that allows the screen, collimator and camera to be squared, centered and collinear with each other within a micron spatially and 5 arcseconds in rotation. I also designed a rigid mount for the screen that was machined on site in Building 10 by another intern. While I was working in the EOL we received a $ 500 k Orion startracker for alignment procedure testing. Due to my prior experience in electronics development, as an ancillary duty, I was tasked with building the cables required to operate and power the startracker. If any errors are made building these cables the startracker would be destroyed, I was honored that the director of the lab entrusted such a critical component with me. This internship has cemented my view on public space exploration. I always preferred public sector to privatization because, as a scientist, the most interesting aspects of space for me are not necessarily the most profitable. I was concerned that the public sector was faltering however, and that in order to improve human space exploration I would be forced into private sector. I now know that, at least at JSC, human spaceflight is still progressing, and exciting work is still being done. I am now actively seeking employment at JSC after I complete my Ph. D and have met with my branch chiefs and mentor to discuss transitioning to a grad Co-op position...|$|R
