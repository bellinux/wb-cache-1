40|$|Caching {{is built}} up each {{time when the}} machine starts up {{according}} to user’s application usability. This built up procedure escalates the efficiency of application’s usage for the next coming access of same application. This cache history is vanished when power is switched off. Most of the time, a user uses the same common applications in his/her daily routine, particularly during the working hours. Moreover, against every new start up, the user bears the penalty of cache rebuilt to achieve better and efficient access because on first time access, the application is opened without caching which results more time to open rather than the second time after the cache has already built up. This paper proposes a novel idea of intelligent and permanent caching which can build up dynamically and can be stored permanently {{in one part of}} cache chip according to user’s application usability. This paper describes an algorithm that how CPU can build a dynamic and intelligent Electrically Editable Permanent Cache (EEPC) according to the probability of user’s application usage in a computer machine. For proposed EEPC, we implement a Probability <b>Calculation</b> <b>Table</b> (PCT) by reusing available compression techniques and through introducing some basic change in cache storage policy.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple geometrical fact which {{could relate to}} the history of mathematics and astronomy. This fact shows a natural link between the circle and the multiples of 6 and it makes it possible to obtain a simple representation of the 12 months of the year, the 24 hours of the day, the 30 days (average number) of the month and the 360 days (approximate number) of the year, which brings us closer to the sexagesimal division of time. Moreover this representation reminds one of the movement of the planets around a centre. Using this fact one will be able also to find geometrically the principal divisor of number 60, to represent numbers in base 60 with a kind of abacus or <b>calculation</b> <b>table</b> and to make a division of the circle into 6 and 12 equal parts. Afterwards one will be able to obtain a division in 360 unequal parts but relatively close to one another, and the goal isn't precisely to obtain an optimal division of the circle in 360 equal parts but to prove that the idea to divide the circle in 360 equal parts can subsequently be suggested by these geometrical facts that have been showed. In this article the author will not answer the following questions: a) What is the origin of the sexagesimal system? b) By which way could one manage to adopt the sexagesimal system starting from the knowledge of the facts exposed in this article and starting from the knowledge of the astronomical data?

40|$|The {{purpose of}} a {{sequence}} logo is to graphically represent the informa-tion of a multiple alignment (fi gure 1), it may consist of DNA, RNA or protein se-quences. Each position in a traditional sequence logo (fi gure 2) is represented by a stack consisting of letters occur-ring at the corresponding position in the multiple alignment. The height of each character is proportional to its frequency, where the most common character is placed {{at the top of}} the stack. The height of the entire stack indicates the informa-tion content available at that position. From table 1 the frequencies with which each ami-no acid occurs at every position in the alignment, can be generated. Then the position specifi c informa-tion is determined. This is done by fi rst calculating the uncertainty measure, H(l), according to Shannon [1]. Subsequently the information content, representing the decrease in uncertainty, is computed. Simply put, the information content, R, is the initial uncertainty mi-nus the uncertainty after additional information has been obtained. By modifying the original formula [1] we get: Rsequence(l) = log 221 – (H(l) + e(n)) Where Rsequence(l) is the amount of information present at position l, log 221 is the highest possible uncertainty at any given position (the 20 equi-probable amino ac-ids and introduced gaps), and e(n) is the correction factor [2] depending on the number of sequences, n, in the alignment. The diff erence between the standard approach and our approach is that we want to show where gaps had to be introduced in the align-ment, and account for these gaps from the start of the <b>calculation</b> (<b>table</b> 1 and fi gure 3). weblogo. berkeley. edu 0...|$|E

Some authors these environmental changes occur for countless reasons, many so-called natural while others are due to anthropogenic interventions. This study aims to assess milk production sustainability using the emergy analysis of indicators, considering the annual cycles of production to help decision making. A conceptual model of the milk production system using the Emergy flow chart was built at the Livestock and Agricultural Production Unit (UPA) of the Alto da Arauna Farm, located in Guzolândia, SP. After data processing, the emergy <b>calculation</b> <b>table</b> was elaborated. Several emergy sustainability indices were calculated and analyzed (indicators Renewability of Emergy Used Total, Index of Environmental Load Ratio of Investment Ratio Emergia beyond the calculations Tranformidades among others) including the Emergy Sustainability Index (ESI). The {{results showed that the}} UPA has a high impact per unit of energy source used to produce milk for the general public. The agricultural production systems with ESI value less than one (1) can be considered unsustainable in the long term. The studied UPA has good working conditions and soil conservation, but has a highly disproportionate use of economy inputs in relation to natural resources, which results in low ESI value. The analysis of this ratio indicated low system efficiency. Several management practices and interventions were proposed aiming at improving sustainability indicators of the production system.  Furthermore, strategies were formulated for more sustainable management of this UPA, thus reducing the impacts of the production system in use. The adoption of methods similar to organic production, agroecological systems, integration between farming and livestock, and/or adoption of silvopastoral system are recommended to improve the sustainability indicators. </div...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a master thesis {{performed}} at MacGREGOR (SWE) AB (Crane Division), Örnsköldsvik. MacGREGOR (SWE) AB (Crane Division) is the world’s leading marine cargo crane supplier with cranes designed for operation in harbor and sheltered water environments. The project aimed to identify and investigate needs and problem areas in the crane cabin with the purpose to design an ergonomic and user-friendly driver environment. Besides ergonomics and user interaction, sturdiness, comfort and safety have been keywords throughout the project. It has not been possible to observe drivers at work because of the world wide location of the cranes. Therefore needs and problem areas were identified through interviews with personnel at MacGREGOR (SWE) AB (Crane Division) and analysis through different methods and softwares such as I- deas, Jack and RULA. The project group has also been given the opportunity to drive a crane and observe the relations between regulators, indicators and driver. To investigate new solutions and designs, competitors and related technologies were thoroughly analyzed. Four concepts were created after the design specification was established. To see how well the concepts fulfilled the identified needs they were evaluated in a merit <b>calculation</b> <b>table.</b> Concept 1 “Rotate all” and concept 4 “Office chair” were then compared in a weak-point analysis. After consultation with the instructors at MacGREGOR (SWE) AB (Crane Division) it was decided that “Rotate all” was to be further developed. The final solution is a combination of new ideas and ideas from the four concepts in the concept design phase. Aspects considering function and form have been carefully thought out using theoretical guidelines in ergonomics, semiotics and gestalts. The new crane cabin emphasizes quality and a feeling for the company through colors, shape and placement. The new crane cabin is based on an adjustable interior suited for drivers between the 5 th and 95 th percentile. A major improvement is the rotating chair with integrated control levers on the armrests. The indicators and regulators are separated and now placed on the walls. The visual field is improved with a larger front window and a tilted floor window. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about a {{linguistic}} phenomenon {{in one of the}} popular humorous entertainment programs, 'Ketoprak Humor??, in RCTI as one of the Indonesian private television channels. Based on the conversations that appear in 'Ketoprak Humor', I find that the players use Javanese speech levels in delivering the story and according to the theories, there are some factors that may influence the use of a particular level. Therefore this study is an attempt to analyze the use of Javanese speech level and the influence of social rules, i. e. social factors and social dimensions on the choice of the Javanese speech levels in the episode of Ketoprak Humor entitled "Gambar Berguna-guna" (The Magical Picture). Then, to collect the data, 1 record one episode of "Ketoprak Humor" randomly. 1 transcribe and put numbers on Javanese utterances along with the context, and classify them based on Poedjosoedarmo?s theory of Javanese speech levels. I put into <b>calculation</b> <b>table</b> to find out the most commonly speech level has been used by the players. After that, I analyze the categorization of the level by giving representative examples. In addition, I analyze each level based on Holmes? theory about social factors and social dimensions to find out the rule of usage of each level that has been used in the episode of Ketoprak humor. After analyzing the data, I find out that the conversations which are produced in "Ketoprak Humor`` are dominated by the use of Ngoko style. However, higher styles such as Madya and Krama also appear in the conversations to show respect or politeness toward the elder or,somebody who has a very high status or to create more serious atmosphere of conversations about a particular problem. In addition, I find out that in the episode of Ketoprak Humor entitled Gambar Berguna-Guna, Ngoko speech level can be used by participants who have the same social status and intimate relationship, people of different social status with intimate or non intimate relationship, in both formal and informal setting, in informal topic, and for affective function. In addition, Madya speech level can be used by participants of the same social status who have intimate relationship, participants of different social status who have close or not close relationship, in both formal and informal setting, in informal topic, and for affective function. Last, Krama speech level in the episode of "Gambar Berguna-Guna" is used by participants who have different social status but intimate relationship, in formal place, in informal topic, and for affective function. It is obvious that there are some occasions whereby the rules of usage according Poedjosoedarmo?s theory are not fully followed due to the specific demand of the stage. Thus, they may use level that makes them easiest in expressing the idea and to be enjoyed fully by the audience...|$|E
