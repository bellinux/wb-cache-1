50|$|A <b>canned</b> <b>cycle</b> {{is a way}} of {{conveniently}} performing repetitive CNC machine operations. Canned cycles automate certain machining functions such as drilling, boring, threading, pocketing, etc... Canned cycles are {{so called}} because they allow a concise way to program a machine to produce a feature of a part. A <b>canned</b> <b>cycle</b> is also known as a fixed cycle. A <b>canned</b> <b>cycle</b> is usually permanently stored as a pre-program in the machine's controller and cannot be altered by the user.|$|E

5000|$|If {{the machine}} control {{supports}} it, the user may {{create their own}} custom canned cycles. As there are numbers not already used for G-codes, new <b>canned</b> <b>cycle</b> programs can be stored at these vacant locations. This may {{be done on the}} popular Fanuc control with a technique referred to as [...] "macro programming", after the Fanuc Macro-B language. (The term [...] "Macro programming" [...] in this sense is distinctly different from its more common use to refer to the action of programming a macro in G-code.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{operation}} of a CNC machine tool is typically controlled by a [...] "part program" [...] written a language known as G-code. [...] Canned cycles are similar in concept to functions in a traditional computer language, and can be compared also to G-code macros. The format for a <b>canned</b> <b>cycle</b> consists {{of a series of}} parameters specified with a letter and a numerical value. The letter is referred to as an [...] "address". (This use of the term [...] "address" [...] may be unfamiliar to programmers of conventional computers. It arises because in early and primitive machine controllers, the binary representation of the letter formed a physical address at which the controller would store the value following.) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Several factors {{influence}} {{the accuracy of}} drilled holes. The most obvious ones are the cutting conditions (cutting speed and feed rate) and cutting configurations (tool material, diameter, and geometry). As such, most previous studies have concentrated on these factors. However, in CNC drilling operations, choosing to use canned cycles may have significant effect on drilled hole quality. The objective of this project is to explore this possibility in detail. This paper presents experimental and analytical results of {{an investigation into the}} dimensional accuracy and surface finish of drilled holes using different canned cycles. A traditional analysis, the Pareto ANOVA, and the Taguchi S/N ratio are employed {{to determine the effects of}} the three major input parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, and <b>canned</b> <b>cycle)</b> on three key accuracy characteristics of drilled holes (diameter error, circularity, and surface roughness), as well as to obtain an optimal combination of the input parameters. The work and tool materials selected are aluminum 6061 and high-speed steel (HSS), respectively. The results indicate that the <b>canned</b> <b>cycle</b> has a profound effect on drilled hole quality, and, in general, <b>canned</b> <b>cycle</b> spot drilling produces the best results.

40|$|Abstract — Despite the {{tremendous}} development in CNC programming facilities, linear and circular cuts {{parallel to the}} coordinate planes {{continue to be the}} standard motions of modern CNC machines. However, the increasing industrial demand for parts with intricate shapes cannot be satisfied with only these standard motions. The proportion of parts which are not covered by the standard CNC motions is certainly growing, due to the increasing industrial demand for intricate shapes. So for that we have decided to develop a new <b>CANNED</b> <b>cycle</b> with the help of MACRO (parametric) programming on Hypo cycloid, combined EP-hypo cycloid curve and last for Bezier surface also. we found that this <b>canned</b> <b>cycle</b> would be useful for different application such as cycloidal speed reducer, lobe pump rotor and surface milling without requiring external arrangement like CAD modeling, CNC interpolator etc...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Many {{difficulties}} may be encountered when preparing CNC programs using conventional programming or <b>canned</b> <b>cycle</b> programming. This study {{tries to}} establish a practical common algorithm allowing the drilling of holes arranged in multiple circular patterns. The programmed algorithm can easily be adapted to any modern CNC unit to create a user cycle or subroutine. To test the capabilities of this algorithm, two case studies were developed. A number of samples were produced successfully. The new algorithm shows high efficiency in the part program establishment and offers the advantage of decreasing the encoding errors. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Surfaces {{formed by}} {{rotating}} quadratic curve are widely applied in engineering practice. After having studied machining methods and machines, the CNC grinding method based on macro program B for borosilicate glass elliptical cone surface machine with high precision is proposed. Within the allowable error, the coordinates are calculated {{according to the}} equation of axial section curve and the surface is formed with tools moving on axial section curve. Through setting parameters of the lathe, the new <b>canned</b> <b>cycle</b> can be defined to process {{all different kinds of}} the elliptical cone surface of same type. With surface triangle adaptive measurement method, machined elliptical cone surface can be detected on coordinate-measuring machine and compared with the theoretical curve. The tolerance resulted from analysis is within 0. 025 mm. Except ellipsoidal surface all solids of rotation and their deformation, in which their axial sections are represented with equation, can be processed and measured with this method...|$|E
