Incremental dynamic analysis (IDA), recommended by ATC- 63 Report, is implemented for the frames based on fiber-beam element model to evaluate their seismic collapse resistances. The result shows that structural parameters have a great influence to seismic <b>collapse</b> <b>resistance.</b> The seismic <b>collapse</b> <b>resistance</b> of frames designed according to the Chinese Seismic Design Code with different span has obvious difference.

40|$|Abstract：Since the {{collapse}} of the Ronan Point Tower in United Kingdom in 1968, the progressive <b>collapse</b> <b>resistance</b> of building structures has attracted a global attention. Important foreign design codes have developed their specifications for building structures to resist progressive collapse, but the related research is still lack in China. This paper presents a series of researches by the Department of Civil Engineering in Tsinghua University on progressive <b>collapse</b> <b>resistance</b> of building structures. The existing design methods are briefly summarized, and two major design methods, which are alternate path (AP) method and tie force (TF) method, are proposed together with feasible procedure and carefully studied factors that are suitable for Chinese structures. The effects of each proposed methods are verified with nonlinear dynamic simulations and the additional cost due to progressive <b>collapse</b> <b>resistance</b> design is compared...|$|E

Kai and Li (2012) carried out experimental and analytical studies of progressive <b>collapse</b> <b>resistance</b> on four full scale beam column assemblies, which were part of eight-storey building. Behavior of steel and RC beam column assemblies with different seismic design and detailing under a progressive collapse scenario was studied (Sadek et al. 2011; Lew et al. 2013) through experimental and analytical investigations. Progressive <b>collapse</b> <b>resistance</b> of RC structure under column removal scenario was examined by many researchers (Yu and Tan 2013 a, b; Su et al. 2009). Experimental {{studies were carried out}} on reduced scaled specimen such as beams and beam-column assemblies prepared with different design and detailing to observe the behavior under progressive collapse scenario. Progressive <b>collapse</b> <b>resistance</b> of precast concrete buildings was examined by Main et al. (2014) through experimental and analytical investigations on full scale test specimen. In their study, precast components were connected using steel link plates that were welded to steel angles embedded in precast beams and steel plates embedded in precast columns.|$|E

In the catenary mechanism, the axes of the longitudinal frame beams can be taken as straight. For the tensile membrane mechanism, the internal area of the frame slabs surrounded by the negative moment yield lines can be viewed as an analysis object, and its two areas of progressive <b>collapse</b> <b>resistance</b> were still in two different planes at the collapse limit state.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} the seismic collapse risk of self-centering moment-resisting frames (SC-MRFs) with viscous dampers located in near-fault regions. This evaluation is based on the comparison of different designs of a prototype steel building using four lateral load resisting frames: 1) conventional moment-resisting frames (MRFs), 2) MRFs with viscous dampers, 3) SC-MRFs and 4) steel SC-MRFs with viscous dampers. The frames are modeled in OpenSees where material and geometrical nonlinearities are taken into account as well as cyclic strength and stiffness degradation. A database of 91 near-fault, pulselike ground motions with varying pulse periods is employed for the nonlinear dynamic analyses. <b>Collapse</b> <b>resistance</b> of the frames is evaluated through incremental dynamic analysis (IDA). The results of the IDA are combined with probabilistic seismic hazard analysis models that account for near-fault directivity to assess collapse risk of the structures. Results show that the predicted collapse capacity is affected by the pulse period of the near-fault ground motions and highlight that self-centering connections can significantly improve the <b>collapse</b> <b>resistance</b> of conventional MRFs. Finally, it is shown that supplemental damping provides superior <b>collapse</b> <b>resistance</b> for all frames...|$|E
30|$|Here {{we report}} {{the results from}} a {{computational}} and experimental study that investigated the static responses of a RC frame that had side column loss. We also evaluated the effect of both tensile membrane action in the frame slabs and catenary action in the frame beams to assess the progressive <b>collapse</b> <b>resistance</b> of structures. A one-third scale structure was designed, built and tested. To get more detailed structural information during the progressive collapse, a non-linear numerical analysis was conducted using the LS-DYNA finite element software (Hallquist 2007). Based on experimental and computational results, the mechanism of progressive <b>collapse</b> <b>resistance</b> of RC frames at different stages is discussed further. With large deformations, a simplified calculation method for catenary action and tensile membrane action are proposed.|$|E

The battalion made steady progress eastward against sometimes spirited defense supporting the infantry regiments of the 4th Infantry Division to the outskirts of Prüm until ordered to go on the defensive on 12 February. Virtually out of contact with the enemy, the battalion used the time to train new replacements and catch up on administrative actions. On 1 March, the battalion went back on the offensive, supporting the infantry attach on Prüm. The break had given the Germans an opportunity to stiffen their defenses, and the battalion suffered 9 killed and 18 wounded in just two days of action. On 8-9 March, the battalion (minus Company C), participated in a raid as part of Task Force Rhino, and advanced 30 km northeast to the town of Reifferscheid—nearly half of the remaining distance to the Rhine River.
