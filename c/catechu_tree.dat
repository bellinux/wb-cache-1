40|$|BACKGROUND: Betel nut (Areca nut) is {{the fruit}} of the Areca <b>catechu</b> <b>tree.</b> Approximately 700 million {{individuals}} regularly chew betel nut (or betel quid) worldwide and it is a known risk factor for oral cancer and esophageal cancer. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the influence of chewing betel quid on metabolic diseases, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We searched Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Science Direct for pertinent articles (including the references) published between 1951 and 2013. The adjusted relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence interval were calculated using the random effect model. Sex was used as an independent category for comparison. RESULTS: Of 580 potentially relevant studies, 17 studies from Asia (5 cohort studies and 12 case-control studies) covering 388, 134 subjects (range: 94 to 97, 244) were selected. Seven studies (N = 121, 585) showed significant dose-response relationships between betel quid consumption and the risk of events. According to pooled analysis, the adjusted RR of betel quid chewers vs. non-chewers was 1. 47 (P< 0. 001) for obesity (N = 30, 623), 1. 51 (P = 0. 01) for metabolic syndrome (N = 23, 291), 1. 47 (P< 0. 001) for diabetes (N = 51, 412), 1. 45 (P = 0. 06) for hypertension (N = 89, 051), 1. 2 (P = 0. 02) for cardiovascular disease (N = 201, 488), and 1. 21 (P = 0. 02) for all-cause mortality (N = 179, 582). CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Betel quid chewing is associated with an increased risk of metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. Thus, in addition to preventing oral cancer, stopping betel quid use could be a valuable public health measure for metabolic diseases that are showing a rapid increase in South-East Asia and the Western Pacific...|$|E
50|$|The {{district}} name originates {{from the}} public canal pier (in Thai: tha), where plenty of <b>catechu</b> <b>trees</b> (Callerya atropurpurea) grow.|$|R
50|$|Khair - Khair (Acacia <b>catechu)</b> <b>trees</b> {{are found}} in Jabalpur, Sagar, Damoh, Umaria, Hoshangabad, Guna, Shivpuri, Sheopur, Morena, Gwalior etc. Khair trees are used as a raw {{material}} for preparation of catechu or kattha.|$|R
50|$|The brand {{was first}} {{launched}} in 1998 and is marketed on its unique black colour that derives from Catechu, an extract from the heartwood of Burmese <b>catechu</b> acacia <b>trees.</b> <b>Catechu</b> does {{not interfere with}} the characteristics of the vodka, imparting no additional flavour or odour and leaving no stains.|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{importance}} of Khair (also known as Catechu) {{in the life of}} rural and tribal communities inhabiting Shivalik range in western Himalaya, India. <b>Catechu,</b> a multipurpose <b>tree</b> species is widely used by the inhabitants for fodder, fuel, building material and in health care. Information on traditional uses and socioeconomic importance of A. catechu were provided with reference to natives inhabiting foothills of Shivalik range in western Hiamlaya, India...|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 488 {{different}} species of plants have been recorded in the park. Tree density inside the reserve is higher {{in the areas of}} Sal forests and lowest in the Anogeissus-Acacia <b>catechu</b> forests. Total <b>tree</b> basal cover is greater in Sal dominated areas of woody vegetation. Healthy regeneration in sapling and seedling layers is occurring in the Mallotus philippensis, Jamun and Diospyros tomentosa communities, but in the Sal forests the regeneration of sapling and seedling is poor.|$|R
40|$|Areca nut, {{commonly}} called as betel nut or supari, is a fruit of areca <b>catechu</b> palm <b>tree,</b> which is native of South Asia and Pacific Islands. The seed or endosperm is consumed fresh, boiled or after sun drying or curing. Chewing areca nut {{is thought to}} have central nervous system stimulating effect and along with this it is known to have salivary stimulating and digestive properties. According to the traditional Ayurvedic medicine, chewing areca nut and betel leaf is a good remedy against halitosis. It is also used for its deworming property. Along with these beneficial effects of areca nut one of its most harmful effects on the human body in general and oral cavity in particular is the development of potentially malignant disorder called Oral Submucous Fibrosis. The present paper discusses in detail the effects of the components of areca nut on pathogenesis of Oral Submucous Fibrosis...|$|R
50|$|The Sahariyas are expert woodsmen {{and forest}} product gatherers. They are {{particularly}} skilled in making <b>catechu</b> from Khair <b>trees.</b> The main business is gathering & selling of forest wood, gum, tendu leaf, honey, mahua and medicinal herbs. Their traditional occupations also include making baskets, mining and quarrying, and breaking stones. They also hunt and fish. Some Sahariyas are settled cultivators. Wheat, pearl millet and maize {{are the main}} cereal crops. Gram and arhar are the main pulses. Agriculture is largely rain-dependent with merely 2% of the total land area being irrigated. The main sources of irrigation are wells and rivulets, which are seasonal. Others are landless labourers who were earlier bonded labourers.|$|R
