40|$|To {{refer to}} the Jacquard loom as a {{precursor}} of the computer is a common narrative in histories of computing beginning with Ada Lovelace comparing the punched card operated loom with the calculating engine designed by Charles Babbage: “We may say most aptly that the Analytical Engine weaves algebraical patterns just as the Jacquard-loom weaves flowers and leaves. ” But {{this does not mean}} that Jacquard invented the algebra of patterns. He only constructed the first widely known and used mechanism replacing the drawboy by punched <b>cards</b> to <b>feed</b> pattern information into his mechanism. To control a weave means to decide whether a warp thread is to be picked up or not. Weaving has therefore been a binary art from its very beginning, applying operations of pattern algebra for millennia. Jacquard’s cards were the end of this story rather than its beginning, reducing the weaver to an operator who had to step on a single treadle repeatedly. This article argues that algebra is already involved in operating shafts or heddles on ordinary looms, that this algebra was applied tacitly until the first weaving notations were developed, and that these notations make the tacit algebra of patterns recognizable to non-weavers: inventors and engineers...|$|R
50|$|A card printer is an {{electronic}} desktop printer with single card feeders which print and personalize plastic cards. In this respect they differ from, for example, label printers {{which have a}} continuous supply <b>feed.</b> <b>Card</b> dimensions are usually 85.60 × 53.98 mm, standardized under ISO/IEC 7810 as ID-1. This format is also used in EC-cards, telephone cards, European Union driver's licenses and health insurance cards. This {{is commonly known as}} the bank card format. Card printers are controlled by corresponding printer drivers or by means of a specific programming language. Generally card printers are designed with laminating, striping, and punching functions, and use desktop or web-based software. The hardware features of a card printer differentiate a card printer from the more traditional printers, as ID cards are usually made of PVC plastic and require laminating and punching. Different card printers can accept different card thickness and dimensions.|$|R
40|$|This report {{uses the}} issues of climate change and genetic {{modification}} to explore four scenarios based {{on whether or not}} the world manages itself well and whether or not New Zealand manages itself well. These four scenarios illustrate why small countries have such a vested interest in international affairs. The paper is the first report of Part II: Scenario Development, of Sustainable Future’s Project 2058. The aim of this report is to explore four possible futures for New Zealand in the year 2058, in order to help inform and develop a National Sustainable Development Strategy for this country. This report builds on the global drivers identified in the research phase of the project (Part I), which will be discussed in more detail in an upcoming report, currently titled The State of New Zealand’s Future. These include 21 global drivers of change, including 14 ‘change agents’ and seven ‘wild cards’. Although change agents and wild <b>cards</b> do <b>feed</b> off each other, we believe that there exist primary change agents that tend to initiate a crisis or a chain of events. In contrast, we identified a second group that often produce change by responding to a primary change agent or wild card. We have called these secondary change agents because government, civil society and/or individuals, through careful consideration, might solve a crisis, minimise harm and/or improve long-term outcomes. However, the converse is equally true; reactive policy initiatives may do more harm than good.  ...|$|R
40|$|Mosquitoes {{often are}} {{collected}} {{as part of}} an arbovirus surveillance program. However, trapping and processing of mosquitoes for arbovirus detection is often costly and difficult in remote areas. Most traps, such as the gold standard Center for Disease control light trap, require batteries that must be charged and changed overnight. To overcome this issue we have developed several passive traps for collection of mosquitoes that have no power requirements. The passive traps capture mosquitoes as they follow a CO₂ plume up a polyvinyl chloride pipe leading to a clear chamber consisting of a plastic crate. We believe the translucent, clear windows created by the crate inhibits escape. Once inside the crate mosquitoes readily feed on honey-treated Flinders Technology Associates cards that then can be processed by polymerase chain reaction for viral ribonucleic acid. Of the two designs tested, the box or crate-based passive trap (passive box trap, PBT) generally caught more mosquitoes than the cylinder trap. In Latin square field trials in Cairns and Florida, PBTs collected mosquitoes at rates of 50 to 200 % of Center for Disease Control model 512 light traps. Mosquito collections by PBTs can be increased by splitting the CO₂ gas line so it services two traps, or by placing an octenol lure to the outside of the box. Very large collections can lead to crowding at honey-treated <b>cards,</b> reducing <b>feeding</b> rates. Addition of fipronil to the honey killed mosquitoes and did not impact feeding rates nor the ability to detect Kunjin viral ribonucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction; this could be used to minimize crowding affects on feeding caused by large collections. The passive traps we developed are made from inexpensive, commonly available materials. Passive traps may thus be suitable for collection of mosquitoes and potentially other hematophagous dipterans for pathogen surveillance...|$|R

40|$|A {{new design}} is {{presented}} for a wideband orthogonal interconnect between two perpendicular printed wiring boards, employing novel geometries and materials to minimize stress under cyclic loading. This will ensure fatigue survivability in high vibration environments, {{opening the door}} to vertical interconnection in RF circuit design. This is, to the best of knowledge, the first complete design and prototype for an orthogonal interconnect at the board level for broadband RF circuits. An analytical approach is used to define the driving parameters in the stress distribution within a smooth curve joining two perpendicular surfaces using analytical geometries, and Finite Element Analysis is used to finalize the design and ensure all constituent materials in the interconnect are subjected to stresses below their fatigue strength at 10 million cycles at full deflection. A manufacturing process is then proposed using thermoforming to shape the Liquid Crystal Polymer base material into the desired geometry, as well as an assembly solution to mount the interconnect to an RF signal <b>feed</b> <b>card.</b> Finally, a test setup is designed allowing for high cycle fatigue testing within the order of hours, including the capability to monitor performance of the interconnect by tracking DC continuity through a simulated application using a single post design.

40|$|Biomass boiler houses {{face some}} typical {{problems}} and a task {{of this work}} is to recognize these problems, {{to find out the}} causes and solutions how to decrease its influence for boiler house operation. Main tasks of the first tests were to perform operating parameters measurements when feeding furnace with average moisture content fuel and dry fuel, to calculate boiler efficiency and to analyze boiler behavior combusting various moisture content fuel. Different grate movements cycles ratio values was noticed. This ration influence in fuel layer thickness on grate, and the higher the ratio, the thicker fuel layer is. Primary air pressure dependence on fuel layer thickness confirms this statement. Different movement of first and second grate part causes fuel layer to fracture. As fuel moisture increases, grate movements cycles ratio should be increased as well. Biomass combustion from bottom to top was noticed. Thin hot coal layer covers the grate and primary air works as catalyst. Hot flue gas dries wet fuel as it flows thru it. Possibilities to improve combustion process were determined. Increasing primary air amount would speed up fuel drying process. Combustion air-preheating acts as catalyst not only for drying, but also for ignition and intensification of combustion process. Recirculation flue gas flow will dry fuel more quickly if it will not be mixed with primary air. Mixing hot flue gas with cold air, mixture temperature drops below water vapor saturation temperature and excess moisture condensates. Increasing grate movements cycle’s ratio improves combustion of wet fuel, however primary air flows has to be redistributed as well. There was no need to change any settings to combust biomass with 54 % moisture content, existing regime <b>card</b> was enough. <b>Feeding</b> wet fuel causes boiler water outlet temperature to decrease, i. e. boiler load decreases. In order to increase boiler load, fuel feeding was increased manually. After increasing fuel amount, secondary and tertiary air fans speed increased automatically, causing higher air excess ratio. Tertiary air set value was decreased manually to maintain lower air excess ratio. Combustion process has stabilized after increasing primary air first and second fan load and decreasing third primary air fan load. Wet fuel contained high amount of conifers spikes, which has ~ 1, 8 % fuel nitrogen content, therefore higher nitrogen oxides emissions were measured. Fuel moisture content has a highest influence for thermal capacity of flue gas condensing economizer, moreover the higher moisture content is the more significant effect on economizer capacity it has. Flue gas temperature after economizer and air excess ratio also has significant effect. To increase flue gas condensing economizer efficiency, air excess ratio must be kept as low as possible. Continuously CO measurement would help to decrease air excess ratio. Flue gas inlet temperature has low effect to the thermal capacity of condensing economizer...|$|R
40|$|Selection of manuscripts for {{publication}} in a scientific journal is a subjective process. Safeguards, such as using multiple independent reviewers, review templates and conflict of interest guidelines, {{try to make the}} process fair. It is clear to editors that some reviewers' judgments are guided by whether they just liked a manuscript or not. The editor's job is to divine if the reasons for the opinion are valid. For some manuscripts, the description "poorly written" weighs heavily {{in the mind of the}} reviewer. Use of the term "data" as a singular noun is often seen as a marker of either scientific naïveté or poor writing. I suspect that failure to use "data" as a plural noun has, on occasion, resulted in dismissal of an otherwise acceptable manuscript. Hopefully not in CJS. Acceptance of the singular form of the word "data" has increased in all fields except academic medicine. The justification cited in medicine is that the word "data," the Latin plural of "datum," refers to multiple facts or observations. In ordinary speech where use of the plural form of data can be cumbersome and pompous, the singular noun is much more acceptable. Journalists use only the singular form, regardless of whether their reports are written or spoken. Other branches of science, such as computing and engineering, have abandoned use of "data" as a plural noun. A search of Google Books shows that the use of plural form of "data," which once outnumbered the singular form by a factor of 4, has been reduced to equality in the last 2 decades. However, a similar search of PubMed shows the plural form in academic medicine to have remained at 3 times the use of the singular form. Therefore, academic medicine, alone among all the sciences, has stuck firm to the requirement for the plural form of "data. " Curiously, the term "datum" is almost never used and appears to be replaced by compound nouns, such as "data point. " So, is the word "data" singular or plural, and does it matter?We cannot ask the Romans because they did use not the words "datum" or "data" as we do in science. The past participle of the verb to give, the words may have been applied as adjectives meaning "given. " For example, "data" was written on a letter to signify that it was given to the recipient. However, "data" in this example is the feminine form of the word to agree with the word "epistola" rather than the plural. Interestingly, this use led to the modern word "date" and its use in letters. Since the seventeenth century logicians have applied the word "data" to elements of a premise upon which conclusions are deduced. Here, "given" implies that further proof is not required. Since the premise should consist of facts if a conclusion is to be sound, the origin of the modern scientific term "data" to mean facts or observations is explained. Many writers credit Pullen 1 with the earliest use of the modern scientific meaning, but a quick perusal of his book, which is available online, reveals that he used "mathematical data" as the title to a chapter containing common trigonometry formulas, the equivalent to the logicians' given premise. Others credit the Computation Laboratory at Harvard University for the first modern use of the term "data" when they described, in 1946, the <b>cards</b> used to <b>feed</b> the computer "with empirical or other data. " However, these writers, and subsequent computer scientists, used "data" to mean the functions programmed by the cards. The introduction of computers into science and medicine in the 1960 s resulted in a gradual shift of this meaning to its modern form in science that describes the observations themselves rather than the methods used to analyze them. Therefore, "data," a very recently coined term in academic medicine, has evolved as required by writers for the purposes of clear communication. The belief that "data" must be treated as a plural noun is not part of that evolution. It is worth remembering the origin and fate of a similar word, "agenda. " It was also coined in the seventeenth century as a noun to describe a collection of items with no "singular form. " This time the word was derived from the Latin verb agere (to do) and had a theological meaning of things to do. Its use evolved in the Nineteenth century to mean items of business at a meeting. A collective noun, it is always treated with the singular tense. Like "datum," its singular form, "agendum," feels contrived. There are many situations where "data" is meant as a collective noun to describe the body of observations of an experiment, and use of the singular tense is more natural. There are other situations where "data" describe multiple discrete observations and the plural feels more appropriate. This editor's advice is to use the phrase that feels most like your spoken voice. Our promise is that use of the singular or plural tense with the word "data" will have no impact on the evaluation of a manuscript for CJS...|$|R
