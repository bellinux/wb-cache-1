Furthermore, we characterize the effects of the connectivity control term on the <b>collective</b> <b>control</b> objective, in terms of robustness of the desired control objective to the disturbance of the connectivity, by resorting to the set Input- to-State Stability framework (set-ISS).

50|$|The {{swashplate}} {{consists of}} two main parts: a stationary swashplate and a rotating swashplate. The stationary (outer) swashplate is mounted on the main rotor mast and {{is connected to the}} cyclic and <b>collective</b> <b>controls</b> by a series of pushrods. It is able to tilt in all directions and move vertically. The rotating (inner) swashplate is mounted to the stationary swashplate by means of a bearing and is allowed to rotate with the main rotor mast. An anti-rotation link prevents the inner swash from rotating independently of the blades, which would apply torque to the actuators. The outer swashplate typically has an anti-rotation slider as well to prevent it from rotating. Both swashplates tilt up and down as one unit. The rotating swashplate is connected to the pitch horns by the pitch links. Alternative mechanics to the stationary (outer) swashplate are the hexapod and the universal joint.Swashplates for helicopters having two rotors mounted on the same shaft are much more complex than the single rotor helicopters.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{mechanisms}} of <b>collective</b> <b>control,</b> such as in Japanese keiretsu, that is characterized by firms’ groupings, decentralized decision-makings and cross-shareholdings. We develop a model about these mechanisms based on initial incentive contracts offered by shareholders to the manager, with an asymmetric information and with a possibility of compensation payments. These mechanisms of control are compared to reputation control, the latter working on original discount process. The results are obtained with simulations. The efficiency of the <b>collective</b> <b>control</b> depends on the levels of discount coefficient and on the differences in effort costs and expected profits. The <b>collective</b> <b>control</b> tends to dominate for {{a larger number of}} environment states for which reputation is inefficient to maintain discipline over the manager only.

40|$|Background Interventions {{to develop}} community-level {{empowerment}} and participation are advocated within public health strategies that emphasise {{the importance of}} control as a social determinant of health. Approaches to defining and measuring <b>collective</b> <b>control,</b> however, are limited. We developed and applied a contextually specific framework for identifying the emergence of <b>collective</b> <b>control</b> in the early stage of a UK area-based community empowerment initiative. Methods Existing conceptualisations of <b>collective</b> <b>control</b> were used {{as a basis for}} development of a logic model, and then framework, for identifying emergent markers of control at the level of intracapability, intercapability, and extra group action. The concepts of power within, power to, and power with were used as overarching categories under which markers of <b>collective</b> <b>control</b> capability and action were identified. The framework was applied to qualitative data generated by our team for this primary analysis from in-depth case studies carried out in ten intervention neighbourhoods in England. Data included contextual area information, 150 interviews, ethnographic observation, participatory group exercises, and the review of 30 local intervention plans. Data were coded in NVivo (version 10) with a predefined thematic framework. Narrative memos were developed and compared and contrasted within and across sites. Ethics approval for the study was awarded by Lancaster University on behalf of Liverpool and Lancaster Universities Collaboration for Public Health Research, and by each individual research institution. Findings Application of the framework showed that <b>collective</b> <b>control</b> manifested in different ways and to varying degrees across field sites. We observed the emergence of new forms of group organising and decision making; the development of collective efficacy and linkages with other organisations; and the beginnings of community action taking place. The emergence of <b>collective</b> <b>control</b> was shaped by existing relationships between residents and histories with local organisations, as well as through features of the intervention itself, such as the provision of tailored support from national organisations. The processes of developing <b>collective</b> <b>control</b> for those involved were unstable, subject to struggle, and part of a continuing, dynamic, nonlinear process. Interpretation The conceptual framework helped identify shifts in <b>collective</b> <b>control</b> capability emergent within and between community groups leading to group action, {{as a result of the}} introduction of the intervention. These shifts were nevertheless precarious and temporal, suggesting a need for approaches that capture complex collective empowerment processes in flux.

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study was}} conducted examining the feasibility of a swashplateless rotor controlled through two trailing edge flaps (TEF), where the cyclic and <b>collective</b> <b>controls</b> were provided by separate TEFs. This analysis included a parametric study examining the impact of various design parameters on TEF deflections. Blade pitch bearing stiffness; blade pitch index; and flap chord, span, location, and control function of the inboard and outboard flaps were systematically varied on a utility-class rotorcraft trimmed in steady level flight. Gradient-based optimizations minimizing flap deflections were performed to identify single- and two-TEF swashplateless rotor designs. Steady, forward and turning flight analyses suggest that a two-TEF swashplateless rotor where the outboard flap provides cyclic control and inboard flap provides collective control can reduce TEF deflection requirements without {{a significant impact on}} power, compared to a single-TEF swashplateless rotor design...|$|E

40|$|Low cost {{alternatives}} {{have been}} sought to provide motion cues in ground-based flight simulators to meet mission objectives. The {{ability to provide}} high frequency vibrations makes the dynamic seat attractive to helicopter training applications. Previous {{studies have found that}} dynamic seat does enhance the realism of the cockpit and affect pilots' workload. This investigation, conducted {{under the auspices of the}} Joint Shipboard Helicopter Integration Process (JSHIP), is using a three degree-of-freedom dynamic seat, i. e., heave, surge, and sway, with limited travels in a research simulator configured as a UH- 60 Black Hawk at NASA Ames Research Center. The seat's effectiveness is studied using hover, landing, pirouette, bob-up/bob-down, sidestep, and acceleration/deceleration maneuvers. Seat commands consist of constant vibrations in heave and sway which provide the fundamental vibratory cues. Pilot station accelerations and <b>collective</b> <b>controls</b> provide onset and sustained commands. In addition, transient effects due to translational-lift, collective; and normal acceleration are produced by regulating the magnitude and frequency that depend on the rotor rpm. Results are compared to flight test data and two other ground-based motion systems configurations, i. e., a motion condition with very large motion travels and a motion condition that is comparable with commercial simulator travels. Both subjective and objective data will be analyzed to determine the significance of the motion cueing effect in each system for selected maneuvers...|$|E
