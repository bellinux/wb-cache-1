40|$|Threatening and <b>connecting</b> <b>messages</b> are {{two types}} of appeals {{commonly}} used to encourage conservation behaviors, yet little research has examined their psychological impacts and behavioral outcomes. This paper describes two studies contrasting these approaches with a neutral comparison and testing their effects on state levels of negative affect, caring, and openness, psychological states which we expected in turn would encourage conservation behavior. Participants viewed visually identical nature videos with no text, connecting text or negative text. They then reported on their state experiences, and were asked to engage in conservation behaviors, including supporting conservation organizations. Findings showed that <b>connecting</b> <b>messages</b> increased caring and openness, and decreased negative affect, and by doing so elicited more conservation behaviors. On the other hand, threatening messages showed no beneficial effects above a neutral comparison without an appeal. Our findings, which we contextualize in motivational theory, can be used to inform the use of messages to promote conservation...|$|R

50|$|By default, when a modem {{is powered}} up, the DCD signal is de{{asserted}}. It is not asserted until the modem either makes an outgoing call, or answers an incoming call, and then connects with a data modem {{on the other}} end.

DCD is deasserted once the local modem is no longer receiving carrier from the remote modem, regardless of which side initiated the disconnect. So long as the DCD signal is high, the computer can assume that any data coming from the modem was sent from the remote side.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{protocol}} for routing data messages from any sensor {{to the base}} station in a sensor network. The protocol maintains an incoming spanning tree whose root is the base station. The spanning tree is constructed as follows. First, each sensor in the network is assigned a unique identifier as if the sensors form a logical two-dimensional grid. Second, each sensor, other than the base station, uses its own identifier to compute the identifiers of its "potential parents" in the spanning tree. Third, the base station starts to periodically send "connected messages". When a sensor receives a <b>connected</b> <b>message</b> from anyone of its potential parents, the sensor makes this potential parent its parent in the tree and starts to periodically send <b>connected</b> <b>messages.</b> This routing protocol is stabilizing such that starting from any state, the protocol converges to a state where all the sensors and only the sensors that can {{be connected to the}} routing tree are connected to the tree. The convergence time of the protocol is proportional to the diameter of the sensor network. The routing protocol also has several other advantages over earlier protocols: overhead of the protocol is small, the protocol avoids unreliable long links to build a reliable routing tree, the protocol balances the load over the whole network, and it has nice fault-tolerance property. We have evaluated this protocol over a sensor network that consisted of about 50 MICA 2 motes using a realistic traffic trace, and observed that the protocol delivers 72 - 99 % of the messages to the base station. open...|$|R

The low-bandwidth connections leave room for children to design not only the look and function, but also the signification of the connections.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} [...] SART- {{to the development of}} real-time systems which is based on super actors, i. e., actors whose behaviour is modelled by statecharts. SART borrows structural concepts from known methods for reactive systems like ROOM and UML-RT, and favours ease of construction by making actors reusable and composable software components. The distinguishing factors of SART are its modularisation of timing constraints and customisable scheduling algorithm. Application actors are not aware of timing requirements. RTsynchronizers capture timing constraints in groups of actors, filter relevant messages and control their scheduling. Time clauses of causally <b>connected</b> <b>messages</b> in system interactions are directly derived from the declarative specification of end-to-end timing constraints. SART supports both prototyping and real-time execution modes. A SART graphical development environment supporting modelling, temporal property checking and code generation has been implemented in Java...|$|R

We got <b>connected</b> <b>messages.</b> I am afraid the only result that they had on my mind was that I regarded these friends with some suspicion. They were long messages very often, spelled out by tilts, and it was quite impossible that they came by chance. Someone then, was moving the table. I thought it was they. They probably thought that I did it. I was puzzled and worried over it, for they were not people whom I could imagine as cheating--and yet I could not see how the messages could come except by conscious pressure.|$|R

Maintenance of uninterrupted service system is technically difficult as well as economically costly. With the invention of new vulnerabilities to system new techniques for determining these vulnerabilities have been implemented. In general, probabilistic packet marking (PPM) and deterministic packet marking (DPM) is used to identify DoS attacks. Later, intelligent decision proto-type was proposed. The main advantage {{is that it can}} be used with both PPM and DPM. But it is observed that, data available in the wireless network information system contains uncertainties. Therefore, an effort has been made to detect DoS attack using dominance based rough set. The accuracy of the proposed model obtained over the KDD cup dataset is 99. 76 and it is higher than the accuracy achieved by resilient back propagation (RBP) model...|$|R

30|$|Citation {{networks}} and author-citation networks (Fig.  2 n-o) can represent relationships between messages, and thus require our extended model {{to express their}} information. However, they cannot express communication, because even the more expressive author-citation network model (Fig.  2 o) only focuses on the production of text. In particular, there are no edges between documents and authors, but only (implicit) edges between authors end documents. Spreading processes (Fig.  2 p) also share the same limitations of either contact sequences or author-citation networks, depending on whether messages and/or authors are represented in the specific model, in addition of not (typically) keeping the text content, which is however a minor problem as text can be easily added to the nodes representing the shared items. Compared with our core model, polyadic conversations (Fig.  2 q) can express almost the same information: both can express unicast, multicast and broadcast relations between messages and actors, both differentiate between information producers and consumers and contain the raw textual information. However, while in our model each individual edge <b>connecting</b> <b>messages</b> and consumers can have a different temporal attribute, in the polyadic conversation model each polyadic interaction has one single temporal value.|$|R

In keeping with Nation’s interests in fluency, extensive reading, and reading instruction, I outline current perspectives on reading fluency {{and its role}} as a key component of reading comprehension abilities. This discussion will include the rapidly increasing importance being given to reading fluency, extensive reading, and reading speed training in English as a first language (L 1) contexts in the past decade. While this extraordinary growth in fluency research in English L 1 contexts might not be well known to many second language (L 2) practitioners, it offers many implications for L 2 reading research and instruction (and Nation is one of very few L 2 researchers to have been out ahead of this curve). The article will also address reasons why fluency research studies often do not demonstrate extraordinary gains in reading comprehension outcomes, pointing to the incremental nature of both fluency and reading comprehension development. Finally, the article will <b>connect</b> <b>messages</b> consistently advocated for by Nation over the past 35 years with current views on reading fluency...|$|R
