There is no continuous parameter to tune even by hand, and it seems that the gravitino mass can be small only as a result of accidental <b>cancellation</b> among <b>period</b> integrals weighted by integer-valued flux quanta. DeWolfe et. al. (2005) proposed to pay close attention to vacua where the Hodge decomposition is possible within a number field, so that the precise cancellation takes place as a result of algebra.

It turns out, in Type IIB compactifications, that those vacua admit non-trivial supersymmetric flux configurations if and only if the reflex field of the Weil intermediate Jacobian is isomorphic to the quadratic imaginary field generated by the axidilaton vacuum expectation value. We also found that flux statistics is highly enriched on such vacua, as F-term conditions become linearly dependent. Comment: 28 + 25 pages, a few references added and a few typos correcte...|$|R

40|$|Two {{issues in}} the {{treatment}} of tropical convection in general circulation models are examined. First, several studies have found significant gradients in clear sky longwave fluxes near large convective systems. Increased upper tropospheric moisture associated with deep convection may explain the reduction in the longwave emission. Similar local gradients are not apparent in measurements from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE), an important data set for model validation. Thus the average cloud forcing and greenhouse effect derived from models and observations may differ systematically over warm tropical oceans. A comparison of ERBE fluxes with radiative calculations using coincident balloon-sonde atmospheric profiles indicates negligible systematic bias in the observations. The effect of convection on the clear sky fluxes may be localized to the edges of individual cloud systems. Second, the balance between shortwave and cloud forcing and longwave forcing is a persistent feature of tropical cloud systems in ERBE data. This cancellation effect has been used to diagnose problems in GCM (General Circulation Model) cloud fields on seasonal time scales. The daily record of net cloud radiative forcing is analyzed to determine the smallest spatial and temporal scales for the balance. The results show <b>cancellation</b> on <b>periods</b> as short as three days for regions smaller than 2. 5 by 2. 5 deg. The analysis indicates that the balance is primarily a local phenomenon characteristic of tropical convection. This is consistent with findings that the small cloud radiative forcing is due primarily to thick tropical cirrus. These results represent a particularly stringent test of convective parameterizations in GCM's with interactive ocean surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to examine the}} extent to which a common set of rules on cancellation rights is appropriate or advisable and whether it is possible. The right to cancel is given to the consumer on the assumption that he may need to be protected in certain selling situations such as doorstep or distance selling or when purchasing certain products such as timeshare and credit. The potential justifications for the right to cancel arise from one or more factors affecting the consumer's freedom to choose, including information asymmetry, situational monopoly and complexity of the contract. This work attempts to match the consumer protection policy objectives to the legislation and also examines the need for, and impact of, internal market harmonisation. The differing rules are subject to detailed analysis, particularly with respect to the provisions on the requirement to inform the consumer of the right, the length of the <b>cancellation</b> <b>period</b> and the effect of cancellation on the obligations of the contracting parties. The generalisation of the right given in certain marketing situations and in respect of specific products as a result of European intervention is criticised as sometimes ignoring the strength or weakness of the justification for regulation. The conclusion is that whilst the UK should be able to progress with harmonisation of some of the technical aspects of the right and the duration of the <b>cancellation</b> <b>period,</b> other key aspects should remain subject to differing rules to reflect the different reasons for intervention.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{response}} variables (RAOs) of a semi submersible unit are inspected. Both operational and survival condition {{as well as}} a shallow draft are inspected. The survival condition is inspected with respect to an element analysis. And both operational- and shallow draft condition are case studies, where the operational condition is inspected for two different damage cases. The unit in question is a four column semi submersible, based on the GG 5000 design. This is a relatively new design, and the first vessel to get this design is in its final engineering stage. Construction start is planned to be in August this year (2012). This unit will get the name COSLProspector and will be built in CIMC Yantai Raffles shipyard in China. The unit is symmetrical about the centre line and close to symmetrical about the vertical transverse plane, only pontoon tips are different. Because of this, no significant simplifications have been necessary in order to simplify the calculation due to computational time. Another reason for not doing any simplifications to the geometry {{is due to the fact}} that the results are desired to be the most realistic. However, to reduce computational time, only half the unit has been modelled due to symmetry about centre line. To find the appropriate element size for the mesh, an element analysis has been carried out. The results from this analysis resulted in a chosen element size of 2. 5 m. This element size both gives accurate results, and requires a relatively short computational time. The units resonance periods has been investigated, and verified by help of hand calculations and comparison with RAOs done by Global Maritime (2011). However not all the values were identical to each other, but many factors can influence on that result. The GM value was not changed in this thesis, but was in Global Maritime (2011), in addition the additional damping was in this thesis taken as 3 % of critical damping, while in Global Maritime (2011), Morrison elements were taken into account. These factors, and perhaps a few shortenings are assumed to be the reason for the small difference in the responses, they are however small differences for most of the periods. Two damage cases have been modelled by flooding two different water ballast tanks. These damages will give an angle of list for the unit. Damage case 1 gives an angle of list of 13. 18 o with a rotation of heel axis of 7 o forward. Damage case 2 gives a list angle of 11. 68 o with a rotation of the heel axis of 39 o forward. An earlier study like this one is done by Henriksen (2011), found in Grenland Groups internal archive. AQWA does not give out the tilt angles in damage cases as this is not the main purpose of this program. Therefore, the list angles for the different cases have been obtained from the report done by Henriksen (2011). However, AQWA will be used to obtain the RAOs for both cases, as well as confirm floating equilibrium in such conditions. It is assumed that the tanks are completely emptied for air, and that seawater is filling the entire volume. A table showing the different tanks flooded and its weight with seawater is shown in table 1. Unit	Volume [m 3]	Sea water weight [MT]BWT ST- 2 	 692. 51 	 709. 82 BWT ST- 8 	 616. 83 	 632. 25 Table 1 : Weight of water for flooded tanksWhen it comes to the RAOs in the damage cases, they are very hard to read. This is mainly due to the fact that the motions in these cases are highly dependent on each other due to coupled motions. Due to an angle of list, the unit is no longer symmetric. As a consequence of this a RAO for a specific degree of freedom can no longer be read like it is only this degree of freedom which is affecting the responses, but one or more of the other degrees of freedom are strongly influencing. This makes some of the peaks appear where not normally expected. It is also noticeable that the highest motions are encountered for damage case 1, which is natural because this case has the highest list angle. The resonance periods are lower in the damage cases compared to the normal operational condition, however not to a degree which is dangerously low. The lowest resonance period is still in heave. From the RAOs in the shallow draft case, it can be noticed that the highest responses in heave are encountered for the shallow condition (14. 5 m) compared to the survival condition (15. 5 m) and operational condition (17. 5 m), however only up to about 18 s, where after that it has the smallest response, and the operational condition has the highest. In roll and pitch the trends are fairly similar. The graphs are a little uneven until the first <b>cancellation</b> <b>period,</b> and then the shallow draft gives a higher response until reaching the resonance period. In the resonance region, the operational condition has the highest response for both roll and pitch, same as for the heave. As a conclusion, the optimal approach in a situation where the unit is heavily tilted is to try to ballast the unit to an even keel. But of course risks of doing this are a possibility, such as slamming problems and the fact that the resonance periods will be shorter...|$|E

In 1981, the school transferred to Monroe High School as was known as the School of the Arts at Monroe. Only grades 7-9 were represented that year. The school stayed at Monroe for many years, eventually becoming a full Jr-Sr. High School, while retaining the name [...] "School of the Arts at Monroe." [...] Until it moved into its current space (the old Eastman School of Music dormitories), when it became [...] "The School of the Arts."School of the Arts has many different after-school arts programs, called Tenth Period. Tenth Period is a class that is offers the following classes: Dance, Jazz Band, Theater Technology, Photography, Visual Arts, and Creative Writing. However, Tenth Period was canceled during the 2008-2009 school year, much to the dismay of the students. Another reason for the <b>cancellation</b> of Tenth <b>Period</b> was due to a budget problem. Now Tenth Period is used for test prep, and students have to be accompanied with a teacher, if they are staying after-school.School of the Arts students can audition into the school with one of the following majors: drama, theatre technology, dance, instrumental, vocal, visual arts, or creative writing. Students then starting in their freshman year receive two back to back forty two minute classes of their major for the rest of high school. Students are able to learn and expand their knowledge and love for their art.Students are also able to join various programs by audition. Some of those programs include: Dance Concert, Fall and Winter Productions, SOTA Singers, Black History Program, Playwrights festival, SOTA Improv group, Senior Jazz and Wind Ensembles, and many more.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{cancellation}} of surgery {{is a significant}} drain on health resources. However, a persistent problem in most hospitals is short notice {{cancellation of}} scheduled operations, even upto the day of surgery. In some cases, patients have been prepared for surgery, and the staff is assembled and expecting to operate. In UK 8 % of scheduled elective operations are cancelled within 24 hours of surgery. The reasons include cancellation by the patient, cancellation for poorly optimized medical conditions, or cancellations due to poor organization. Many of these are difficult to quantify. However, one relatively easily measured factor {{is the possibility that}} some operating lists were predictably over-booked. An operating list may over-run because of delayed starts, slow turnover, unanticipated surgical/anaesthetic problems or staff shortages. Many of these are difficult to quantify. Background and objectivePrince Sultan Cardiac center {{is one of the largest}} referral center in the Middle East and there is no published data on the reasons for cancellation of specifically cardiac procedures. However, an audit was performed to assess the reasons for the cancellation of the cases on the day of surgery in cardiac theatres. According to one of the studies published in an Australian journal the percentage of cancelled cardiothoracic cases was determined to be 15. 8 %. ResultsTotal number of cardiac surgical patients including pediatric and adult during a period from June 2008 to May 2009 were 2191. Out of those, 1681 cases were done during the study period, 510 (23. 27 %) cases were cancelled during the study period. The operation theatre was functional for 331 days during the study <b>period.</b> <b>Cancellations</b> done by the surgeons were 34 % while the patient’s related cancellations were 32 %. The administrative issues contributed to 34 % in overall cancellation and anaesthetist-related cancellation were 0 %. ConclusionWe estimated 22 % of the elective operations which were cancelled on the day of surgery were potentially avoidable. There is still a need to do further research to look for the identifiable reasons and strategic measures to eliminate the reasons for cancellation on the day of surgery...|$|R
40|$|Although {{over thirty}} {{years have passed since}} the {{enactment}} of our Constitution, and the right to strike is thereby acknowledged as a fundamental right that therefore needs to be set out in an Organic Law, the regulations on the matter date from before the Constitution and consequently the Constitutional Court, through its doctrine (STC 11 / 1981 of 8 th April [RTC 1981, 11]), has had to step in to save them from being unconstitutional. But despite the existence of doctrine of case-law from the Constitutional and the Supreme Courts, disputes about the qualification of the right to strike have continued, especially if we go into topics such as the need to regulate the establishment of minimum services and in view of the range of new situations of conflict that occur today because they are not provided for. An example of this situation is the recent ruling of the Social Court No. 16 of Madrid, dated 24 th January 2011, on the failure to comply with minimum services in the Madrid Metro, which judged the strike on 29 th and 30 th June 2010 to be illegal; in the same ruling reference is also made to the failure to enact an Organic Law and the need to resort to the Constitutional Court (STC 11 / 1981 of 8 th April) to interpret {{the extent to which a}} service can be considered essential when it comes to scheduling minimum services. As pointed out by the Constitutional Court, the judge has decided to declare the strike illegal based on a careful weighing up or evaluation of the effects of the strike in each case, since, on the one hand, it is necessary to guarantee a service where constitutional precepts converge with the fundamental right to strike and the right to communication, transport, attendance at place of work, and so forth (STC 56 / 1983 of 5 th May [RTC 1983, 56], which we will address in the Ruling that we now go on to discuss below. In my opinion, the Ruling of the National High Court of Spain (AS 2011, 3) mentioned above does not address the issues underlying the strikes in enough depth and neither does it get to grips with the effects that might arise from calling strikes that coincide with one another or overlap. The Court insists on its being exceptionally called off, without addressing the fact that this cancellation cannot be compared with withdrawal, since, as indicated by the Supreme Court in its Ruling dated 17 th December 1999 (RJ 2000, 522) “(…) Withdrawal is an act of will by the strike committee or body that has promoted the conflict measure that puts an end to the declared labour conflict, thus declaring it to be over on a permanent or at least unlimited basis (…) ” and calling off a strike entails an act of withdrawal, hence withdrawal in an intermittent strike must affect all of it and not just the “stoppages” that are interspersed between times of actual work; the <b>cancellation</b> of a <b>period</b> of time could therefore never affect the withdrawal of the whole strike (FJ Noveno, STS 17 th December 1999). So, why is it called an exceptional cancellation? A strike that has been called should not be qualified until it has finished, because who can assure us that during the period between 8 th June and 30 th June there will not be another "exceptional cancellation"? Moreover, neither does it address the issue of the strike that “overlaps” that day with the evening cancellation of the intermittent strike, the fact that it is noted that it affects the whole enterprise and it is eluded by rejecting the appeal in joint litigation with the Sindicato Ferroviario SF (which had called a strike for that day), when, additionally, the enterprise had not even taken the steps necessary to propose a series of minimum services, how was the enterprise going to bring proceedings against that Sindicato...|$|R
