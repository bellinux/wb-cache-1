40|$|Student Number : 0003370 N - MSc {{dissertation}} - School of Civil and Environmental Engineering - Faculty of EngineeringThis dissertation {{investigates the}} different {{design and construction}} considerations involved when building a masonry dome. A detailed shape investigation was undertaken in order to summarize the best shaped dome structures. General recommendations are given for the shapes that produce the least tension and the most useable space. The effects of openings, temperature loading and wind loading were considered and a finite element analysis of the final structure was undertaken. It was found that regions of high tension exist around openings, especially under temperature loading, and materials suitable to resisting this tension were investigated (fibre plaster, <b>chicken</b> <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> and wire wrapping around openings). The final structure was built using an inflatable formwork. The construction procedure was well documented and a study of alternative methods of construction is presented. This dissertation shows that a durable, architecturally and structurally efficient low-cost masonry dome can be built if proper attention is given to minimizing and resisting tension within the structure...|$|E

40|$|Results of an {{experimental}} investigation on sandwich blocks fabricated using lightweight aerated concrete {{encased in a}} ferrocement box are presented in this paper. The primary variables investigated are the type of <b>wire</b> mesh; <b>chicken</b> and square <b>wire</b> <b>mesh,</b> and number of <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> layers in the ferrocement box. The response variables considered include compressive strength, overall unit weight and failure mode. The results are compared with control block specimens made solely of the aerated concrete. The results showed significant increases in compressive strength due to the encasement of aerated concrete. Overall, the unit weight of the sandwich blocks comply with the specifications for lightweight structural components.

Stacking the bags against the wall is preferably preceded by laying a base on the ground {{at the foot of the}} wall using a material such as cement or crushed stone wrapped in a non-woven fabric (e. g., geosynthetic felt). It is also preferred to erect stationary corner posts at the ends of the wall to be insulated, the top ends of the posts being tied to each other and/or tied or otherwise anchored to the wall. The invention also includes the structure made by this process. The structure comprises a stack of bags of insulating material next to the exterior wall of a building, said stack of bags of insulating material being attached to said wall and having a covering of cementitious material on the side not adjacent to said wall...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Flame {{stability}} of gaseous fuel inside meso-scale combustor with double <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> was investigated experimentally. Combustor {{was made from}} quartz glass tube with an inner diameter of 3, 5 mm and an outer diameter of 5 mm. Two pieces of <b>wire</b> <b>meshes</b> were made from stainless steel inserted at 10 and 13 mm {{from the end of}} combustor. Propane was used as fuel in this research. Flame was stabilized in the region between two <b>wire</b> <b>meshes.</b> The flame has a blue luminosity, indicate no soot formation condition. However, the second <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> and combustor wall has red luminousity at high velocity reactant, indicate that they have high temperature and emmited heat radiation. Meso-scale combustor with double <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> has broader flame stability area if compared to combustor with single <b>wire</b> <b>mesh.</b> Extention of this region occured toward lower equivalence ratio for lean fuel mixture, as well as toward higher equivalence ratio for rich fuel mixture. The most important extention region of flame stability area is toward higher reactant flow rate. It was caused by existing of second <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> which has function to prevent occurence of blow–off at relatively high reactant flow rate, as well as to increase heat recirculation to unburnt reactant as a results of higher wall temperature...|$|R

40|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>mesh</b> dampers {{are under}} {{investigation}} {{because they are}} seen as replacements for squeeze film dampers {{as a source of}} direct stiffness and damping at bearing locations. There are several advantages of <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> dampers over squeeze film dampers, including: temperature insensitivity, oil-free operation, and the ability to contain large amplitude vibrations. Furthermore, due to their direct damping and lack of cross-coupled stiffness, the <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> reduces the response to imbalance and increases the stability of the system. The objective of this research was to determine the properties of <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> dampers under large amplitude vibrations. Impact testing was first conducted on the <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> as a means of obtaining the large amplitudes that were of interest. Next, to verify the results, a second methodology was employed using shaker testing. It was found that both the stiffness and hysteretic damping decrease with increasing displacement. However, they both approached asymptotes around 2 mils of displacement, and further increases in displacement had significantly less effect on the properties. Once the results were verified to be consistent, equations were obtained to describe the response of the <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> dampers. These equations were then used to create a new design workbook, which would allow an engineer to determine the properties of <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> dampers under conditions that they might experience...|$|R

5000|$|Wire decking is {{commonly}} used as a safety measure on selective pallet rack to prevent pallets or the products stored on them from falling through the rack structure. <b>Wire</b> <b>mesh</b> decking comes in various thicknesses and <b>mesh</b> dimensions. <b>Wire</b> <b>mesh</b> construction also allows for easy identification of shelf contents and prevents dirt and other debris from accumulating on the shelves because of {{the holes in the}} <b>mesh.</b> Most <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> decking has U-shaped channel supports, also known as struts, to support the load. With this waterfall decking, the <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> extends across the top and down the front of the beam to provide more support, and is more desirable in the marketplace. Reverse waterfall decking can provide containment of a loose product to prevent the product from falling behind the rack system. Lay-in decking rests inside the step of the beam, and <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> does not waterfall over the beam. Some types of decking are manufactured with solid metal instead of <b>wire</b> <b>mesh.</b> Even though the solid decking provides a greater distributed weight capacity, it is discouraged by fire inspectors because sprinkler systems cannot spray through the shelves to levels below.|$|R

40|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>mesh</b> {{vibration}} dampers {{have been the}} subject of some very encouraging experiments at the Texas A&M Turbomachinery laboratories for the past several years and have emerged as an excellent replacement for squeeze film dampers. Their capability to provide damping for a wide range of temperatures (even cryogenic), fluid free operation and ability to perform even when soaked with lubricants makes them a suitable option as a bearing damper. Experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of design parameters like axial thickness and axial compression that influence the characteristics of <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> as a bearing damper. Two groups of <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> were tested to show that the stiffness and damping are directly proportional to the axial thickness, if all the other parameters are kept constant. Tests on four <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> donuts of different radial thickness showed that stiffness and damping vary inversely with radial thickness. Rigorous tests were also conducted to quantify the effects of axial compression, radial interference and displacement amplitude on stiffness and damping of the <b>wire</b> <b>mesh.</b> Another novel kind of mesh damper tested was comprised of two small segments instead of a whole donut. The results showed that <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> exhibited good damping characteristics even when used in small segments.
