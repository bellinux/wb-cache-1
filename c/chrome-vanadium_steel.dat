50|$|The Olmsted-Buffalo-Pitts 1912 Monocoque Bird {{with its}} wings made of thin-gauge <b>chrome-vanadium</b> <b>steel</b> sheet, {{aluminum}} sheet, and basswood lamination, and its fuselage molded of monocoque laminated birch and <b>chrome-vanadium</b> <b>steel</b> sheet {{was one of}} the first true “airplanes” of scientifically engineered design and structure ever to be manufactured. The plane’s original development was stopped when it was 90% completed due to the bankruptcy of the Buffalo Pitts Company in the summer of 1912. Charles Olmsted then formed the CMO Physical Laboratory and continued to manufacture and sell the ultra-efficient propellers on his own for another seven years.|$|E
50|$|The Zastava M07 is {{a modern}} {{military}} sniper rifle developed and manufactured by Zastava Arms, Serbia. The M07 rifle {{is based on the}} Mauser 98 bolt action, and the barrel is made of <b>chrome-vanadium</b> <b>steel.</b> The rifle is loaded from a detachable magazine with a capacity of 5 rounds.|$|E
50|$|The fin-stabilised shells {{made from}} <b>chrome-vanadium</b> <b>steel</b> {{were able to}} {{penetrate}} much more than 4 m of reinforced concrete roof before burying the shell through the floor and into earth. However, these shells had a low muzzle velocity, and thus a high dispersion, 36 m on 1000 m range. As a result, they saw very limited use during World War II; only about 200 shells were ever fired even though 6000 such shells were made for the very large howitzers like the 21 cm mortar.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{properties}} of ledeburitic <b>chrome-vanadium</b> tool <b>steel</b> after heat treatment. Theoretical part contains charakterization of ledeburitic steels, the posibility of manufacturing and heat treatment. There are also briefly describes {{the principles of the}} test methods, which were used. The practical part is focused on describing the results of 12 sample groups, with different heat treatment. The results are compared in the final discussion...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{excellent}} {{mechanical properties}} of <b>chrome-vanadium</b> low alloy <b>steel</b> usually obviate {{the need for}} expensive quench and tempering operations. Furthermore, {{the presence of a}} significant amount of nitride phases has generated interest in the applicability of this kind of steel to fabricate tools with good corrosion and wear resistance. In this paper, 32 CDV 13 low alloy steel was ion nitrided under different process parameters including time (2, 4, 6 and 8 h), temperature (380, 500 and 580 8 C) and gas mixture (N 2, H 2 and CH 4). By determining phase composition, hardness profiles, compound layer thickness and case depth, the optimum working conditions were determined. Microhardness tester, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were utilised to characterise the nitrided surfaces. The observed differences in the hardness, the thickness and the structure of the compound layers and the diffusion zones are discussed. The optimum results were obtained at 75 %N 2 þ 20 %H 2 þ 5 %CH 4 gas mixture, at the temperature of 500 8 C and for a process time of 8 h...|$|R
50|$|When {{he began}} {{climbing}} in 1945, {{he found that}} traditional pitons used for climbing in the Alps were too soft to be driven into narrow cracks without buckling. In his San Mateo business, Peninsula Wrought Iron Works, Salathé used high-carbon <b>chrome-vanadium</b> <b>steel,</b> {{similar to that used}} to make Ford axles, to forge extremely strong pitons which could be hammered into the hard Yosemite granite without buckling, as well as removed without getting mangled, thus rendering them reusable. These thin pitons became known as Lost Arrows, and are still manufactured under that name by Black Diamond Equipment, Ltd.|$|E
