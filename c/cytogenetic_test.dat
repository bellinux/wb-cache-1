Henceforth, the current study was planned to compare oxidative stress and mutagenic potential of different irradiation doses of fast neutron (FN) and UV-B on meiotic-pollen mother cells (PMCs), pollen grains (PGs) and seeds yielded from irradiated faba beans seedlings. On the cytogenetic level, each irradiation type had special interference with DNA of PMC and exhibited wide range of mutagenic action on the frequency and type of chromosomal anomalies, fertility of PGs and seed yield productivity based on the irradiation exposure dose and radiation sensitivity of faba bean plants compared with un-irradiated ones. On the molecular level, SDS-PAGE and RPAD-PCR analyses of seeds yielded from irradiated seedlings exhibited distinctive polymorphisms based on size, intensity, appearance, and disappearance of polypeptides bands compared with un-irradiated ones. The total values of protein and DNA polymorphisms reached 88 % and 90. 80 % respectively.

40|$|Since {{the early}} {{studies on the}} genetic effects of {{chemical}} and physical agents, species and clones of Tradescantia {{have been used as}} experimental subjects, by virtue of a series of favorable genetic characteristics. Bearing just six pairs (2 n = 12) of large, easily observable chromosomes, cells from almost every part of the plant, from the root tips to the developing pollen tube, yield excellent material for cytogenetic studies. As a consequence of the intensive use of Tradescantia in genetic studies, a series of genetic characteristics have been found that offer opportunities for the detection of agents affecting the stability of the genome. At least five such characteristics have been selected as endpoints for the establishment of assays to evaluate mutagenesis. Three of these, root-tip mitosis, pollen-tube, and microspore mitosis are essentially chromosome aberration assays, wherein one observes and evaluates the visible damage in the chromosomes. A fourth, the stamen-hair mutation assay (Trad-SHM), is a point mutation mitotic assay based on the expression of a recessive gene for flower color in heterozygous plants.

40|$|Klinefelter, Turner, {{and fragile}} X syndromes are {{conditions}} {{defined by a}} genetic or chromosomal variant. The timing of diagnosis, tests employed, specialists involved, symptoms evident, and prognoses available vary considerably within and across these syndromes, but all three share in common a diagnosis verified through a molecular or <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>test.</b> The genetic or chromosomal variant identified designates a syndrome, even when symptoms associated with the particular syndrome are absent. This article analyzes interviews conducted with parents and grandparents of children with these syndromes from across the USA to explore how they interpret a confirmed genetic diagnosis {{that is associated with}} a range of possible symptoms that may never be exhibited. Parents' responses indicate that they see the genetic aspects of the syndrome as stable, permanent, and authoritative. But they allow, and even embrace, uncertainty about the condition by focusing on variation between diagnosed siblings, the individuality of their diagnosed child, his or her accomplishments, and other positive aspects that go beyond the genetic diagnosis. Some families counter the genetic diagnosis by arguing that in the absence of symptoms, the syndrome does not exist. They use their own expertise to question the perceived certainty of the genetic diagnosis and to employ the diagnosis strategically.

Previous investigations revealed that thyroid hormones induce DNA damage on human lymphocytes and sperm in the in vitro Comet assay. However, cytogenetic evaluation of genotoxic effects of thyroxine gave equivocal results: increase of sister chromatid exchanges, and no incerase of micronuclei in cultured human lymphocytes. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} present study was to further evaluate the possible genotoxic effects of thyroxine using in vivo <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>test</b> on Swiss albino mice. Three experimental concentrations of thyroxine were used (0. 1 mg/kg, 0. 5 mg/kg and 2. 5 mg/kg). The mice were divided into several groups depending on the duration of the treatment with thyroxine. Thus, we treated mice for 1, 3, 7 and 10 days. Positive (Nmethyl- N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine) and negative controls were also formed for the same time periods. Cytogenetic endpoinds (numerical and structural aberrations, chormosome gaps and breaks) were analysed in bone marrow cells from femures. The results obtained in this investigation showed that thyroxine has not induced chromosome damage or aberrations. This is in agreement with our previous analysis of micronuclei in human peripheral blood lymophocytes treated with thyroxine. On the other hand, we observed a decrease of mitotic index especially in animals treated for a longer period of time with the highest dose of thyroxine. Therefore, it can be concluded that thyroxine does not induce genotoxic effects which could be detected by cytogenetic analysis...|$|E

The trade-off between cost and effectiveness was expressed via the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed via Monte Carlo simulation. The baseline AGH testing strategy led to an average cost increase of $ 217 (95 % CI $ 172 –$ 261) per patient and an additional 8. 2 diagnoses in every 100 tested (0. 082; 95 % CI 0. 044 – 0. 119).

A total of 129 males were investigated, 54 mentally normal and 75 presenting mental retardation. Among the 54 normal males, 11 had the premutation, and none expressed the fragile site. The full mutation was detected in 73 retarded males, and 14 (18 %) presented a premutation along with the full mutation (mosaics). All of them manifested the fragile site. The frequencies of fragile site expression correlated positively with the sizes of {{the expansion of the}} CGG repeats (D). Among 153 normal females, 85 were found to be heterozygous for the premutation and 15 had the full mutation. In the premutated females the fragile site was not observed or it occurred at frequencies that did not differ from those observed in 53 noncarriers. Cytogenetic analysis was thus ineffective for the diagnosis of premutated males or females. Among the 51 heterozygotes for the full mutation, 36 (70 %) had some degree of mental impairment.

We then examined whether these factors could explain the observed differences in the {{prevalence of}} trisomy 21 among race-ethnicity groups. Among all pregnancies with birth defects, prenatal cytogenetic testing as well as elective terminations after an abnormal prenatal <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>test</b> result were observed less frequently among Hispanic women than among non-Hispanic white women (odds ratio [OR] 0. 66, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 56 - 0. 78, respectively). In pregnancies affected by trisomy 21, both the Hispanic and the non-Hispanic black populations had more live births (89. 5 % and 77. 8 %, respectively) and fewer elective terminations (5. 7 % and 15. 2 %, respectively) compared to the non-Hispanic white population (63. 0 % live births, 32. 3 % elective terminations). After adjusting for elective terminations, non-Hispanic white mothers had a higher live birth prevalence of trisomy 21 compared to non-Hispanic black (OR 0. 64, 95 % CI 0. 54 - 0. 76) or Hispanic mothers (OR 0. 69, 95 % CI 0. 55 - 0. 86).

40|$|Background: Fanconi anemia (FA) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessive disorder characterized by short stature, skeletal anomalies, increased incidence of solid tumors and leukemia, and bone marrow failure (aplastic anemia). FA {{has been reported in}} all races and ethnic groups and affects men and women in an equal proportion. The frequency of FA has been estimated at approximately 1 per 360, 000 live births. In some populations, including Ashkenazi Jews, Turks, Saudi Arabians and Iranians, this frequency appears to be higher, probably {{as a result of the}} founder effect and consanguineous marriage. Because of extensive genetic and clinical heterogeneity (the age of onset, clinical manifestations and survival), diagnosis of FA on the basis of clinical data alone is unreliable and its molecular diagnosis is difficult. The diagnosis of FA exploits the hypersensitivity of FA lymphocytes and fibroblasts to bifunctional alkylating agents such as mitomycin C (MMC), diepoxybutane (DEB) and nitrogen mustard and differentiates it from idiopathic aplastic anemia. In this study, in addition to the patients' clinical profiles, a <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>test</b> using MMC was implemented for an accurate diagnosis of Fanconi anemia. Methods: In this study, the lymphocytes of 20 patients referred for FA, and those of their normal sex-matched controls, were treated with three different concentrations of mitomycin C (20, 30, 40 ng/ml). Slides were prepared and solid stained. In order to determine the number and kind of chromosome abnormalities, 50 metaphase spreads from each culture were analyzed. Clinical information was obtained from patient files. Results: Five patients manifested increased chromosome breakage with MMC, confirming the FA diagnosis. Two different concentrations of MMC (30, 40 ng/ml) were most effective. Conclusion: The chromosomal breakage test is important for the accurate diagnosis of Fanconi anemia. DNA crosslinking agents used to treat idiopathic aplastic anemia may be lethal for patients with FA. Thus, aplastic anemia patients with unknown etiology, infants with congenital abnormalities involved in FA and siblings of FA patients should also be cytogenetically tested. "n&nbsp...|$|E

METHODS: cytogenetic analysis was performed on 219 spontaneous abortion specimens. Forty of these cases were also submitted to fetal sex determination using nested-PCR. Thirty-two of these cases were selected due to failed cytogenetic culture and the other eight were selected randomly. Twenty samples were submitted to the FISH technique, using probes for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y. Thirteen of these samples were selected due to failed cytogenetic culture and the other seven were randomly selected. The success rates of each technique were compared using the chi 2 test and an established p< 0. 05 level of significance. The results of samples submitted to more than one test were evaluated for accuracy, using the cytogenetic result as the gold standard. RESULTS: cytogenetic analysis was successful in 84. 9 % of the samples and in 51. 1 % of them the results were abnormal: 65. 2 % trisomy, 17. 9 % triploidy, 9. 4 % tetraploidy, 4. 2 % chromosome X monosomy, and 1. 1 % each for double trisomy, tetrasomy and structural abnormality.

It {{is not uncommon for}} patients to be diagnosed later in life due to short stature or delayed puberty, or a combination of both.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Classic {{cell culture}} and {{karyotyping}} is routinely used for prenatal detection of different chromosomal abnormalities. Molecular cytogenetic techniques have also recently been developed {{and used for}} this purpose. Quantitative florescence PCR using short tandem repeat (STR) markers has more potential for high throughput diagnosis. Marker heterozygosity in short tandem repeats (STR) is of critical importance in the clinical applicablity of this method. "nMaterials and Methods: Different STR markers on chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y&nbsp; were analysed from&nbsp; amniotic samples to detect related disorders such as Down, Edward, Patau,&nbsp; Klinefelter sundromes, as well as sex chromosomes numerical abnormalities. "nResults: In our population some markers (D 18 S 976, DXS 6854, D 21 S 11, and D 21 S 1411) showed alleles with sizes out of expected ranges. But others occupied narrower range of predicted distribution. Most markers have enough heterozygosity (66. 3 - 94. 7) {{to be used for}} prenatal diagnosis. Furthermore, results obtained from full karyotype for all samples were in concordance with results of molecular <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>testing.</b> "nConclusion: It is concluded that, in urgent situations, if proper markers used, molecular <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>testing</b> (QF-PCR) could be a useful method for rapid prenatal diagnosis (PND) in populations with high rate of consanguinity such as Iran. &nbsp;&nbsp...|$|R
40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{analysis was conducted}} on 36 patients who underwent surgery for childhood or juvenile thyroid cancers and who were regularly followed up {{during the course of}} 30 years. The biological properties and late prognosis of these patients were assessed, and the clinical and morphological characteristics of the tumors were examined. The distribution of the DNA content in the tumor cells was compared with that in adult tumor cells, and the results of <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>tests</b> performed on mothers operated on for thyroid tumors and their children are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{determine}} {{the proportion of}} uveal melanoma patients who accept cytogenetic prognostication and to understand {{the reasons for their}} decision and the psychological impact of an adverse prognosis. Methods Patients treated by enucleation or local resection for uveal melanoma between 01 January 2003 and 31 December 2006 were identified and the proportion undergoing cytogenetic studies was determined. In-depth interviews of fourteen patients living near our centre were conducted to {{determine the}}ir reasons for accepting <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>testing</b> and their reactions to any results received. Results In total 97...|$|R
40|$|A {{standardized}} nomenclature {{is critical}} for the accurate and consistent description of genomic changes as identified by karyotyping, {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} and microarray. The International System for Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature (ISCN) is the central reference for the description of karyotyping, FISH, and microarray results, and provides rules for describing cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic findings in laboratory reports. These laboratory reports are documents to the referring clinician, and should be clear, accurate and contain all information relevant for good interpretation of the cytogenetic findings. Here, we describe guidelines for cytogenetic nomenclature and laboratory reports for <b>cytogenetic</b> <b>testing</b> applied to tumor samples...|$|R
