40|$|Retinoic X {{receptor}} (RXR) is {{a promising}} target for drug discovery against cancer and metabolic syndromes. Here, we identified a specific RXRα antagonist, danthron, {{from the traditional}} <b>Chinese</b> medicine <b>rhubarb.</b> Danthron repressed all tested RXRα-involved response element transcription, including the RXRE, PPRE, FXRE, and LXRE. Results from native PAGE and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) -based assays indicated that danthron bound to the tetrameric RXRα-LBD in a specific stoichimetric ratio, and such a binding could influence the corepressor SMRT affinity to the receptor. Additionally, a unique tetrameric structure of the apo-RXRα ligand-binding domain (LBD) was determined, which exhibited a larger tetramer interface and different ligand-binding pocket size compared with the one previously reported. Together with the biochemical and biophysical results, the determined crystal structure of danthron-soaked RXRα-LBD suggested a new mechanism for danthron antagonism to tetrameric RXRα. Moreover, the in vivo efficient improvement of insulin sensitivity by danthron was observed in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Thus, our findings were expected to supply {{new insights into the}} structural basis of RXRα antagonist for its further potential therapeutic application...|$|R

50|$|Though {{the root}} of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>rhubarb</b> is a key facet of herbal medicine, its leaves can {{actually}} be poisonous if consumed in a high enough dosage. The oxalic acid crystals found in the leaves may cause a health risk. Owing to the swelling of the tongue and throat, breathing canals become constricted, ultimately preventing breathing. Patients with “arthritis, kidney problems, inflammatory bowel disease, or intestinal obstruction” should refrain from consumption.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. At least 50 % of hypertrophic {{scarring}} (HS) {{is characterized}} by inflammation, {{for which there is}} currently no effective treatment available. Emodin is a major compo-nent of the widely used <b>Chinese</b> herb, <b>rhubarb,</b> which has been used to treat inflammation in several types of disease. However, few studies have investigated the efficacy of emodin in the treatment of HS. In the present study, a mouse model with mechanical stress‑induced HS was used to inves-tigate the effects of emodin (20, 40, 80, or 120 mg/ml) on HS, and to determine the potential underlying mechanisms. Treatment with emodin significantly attenuated HS inflam-mation, as determined by histopathological assessment of the scar elevation index, collagen structure and inflammation (P< 0. 05). Furthermore, treatment with emodin (40 mg/ml) markedly inhibited phosphoinositide 3 ‑kinase (PI 3 K) /Akt activity (P< 0. 01) and this attenuation was associated with reduced expression levels of tumor necrosis factor‑α, inter-leukin‑ 6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein‑ 1 (P< 0. 05) in the HS tissue. The {{results of the present study}} indicated that administration of emodin had therapeutic effects on the progression of HS and the underlying mechanism of this may be due to inhibition of the PI 3 K/Akt signaling pathway...|$|R
40|$|Rhein is {{a primary}} {{anthraquinone}} found in the roots of a traditional <b>Chinese</b> herb, <b>rhubarb,</b> and {{has been shown to}} have some anticancer effects. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effect of rhein on the apoptosis of the human gastric cancer line SGC- 7901 and to identify the mechanism involved. SGC- 7901 cells were cultured and treated with rhein (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 µM) for 24, 48, or 72 h. Relative cell viability assessed by the MTT assay after treatment was 100, 99, 85, 79, 63 % for 24 h; 100, 98, 80, 51, 37 % for 48 h, and 100, 97, 60, 36, 15 % for 72 h, respectively. Cell apoptosis was detected with TUNEL staining and quantified with flow cytometry using annexin FITC-PI staining at 48 h after 100, 200 and 300 µm rhein. The percentage of apoptotic cells was 7. 3, 21. 9, 43. 5 %, respectively. We also measured the mRNA levels of caspase- 3 and - 9 using real-time PCR. Treatment with 100 µM rhein for 48 h significantly increased mRNA expression of caspase- 3 and - 9. The levels of apoptosis-related proteins including Bcl- 2, Bax, Bcl-xL, and pro-caspase- 3 were evaluated in rhein-treated cells. Rhein increased the Bax:Bcl- 2 ratio but decreased the protein levels of Bcl-xL and pro-caspase- 3. Moreover, rhein significantly increased the expression of cytochrome c and apoptotic protease activating factor 1, two critical components involved in mitochondrial pathway-mediated apoptosis. We conclude that rhein inhibits SGC- 7901 proliferation by inducing apoptosis and this antitumor effect of rhein is mediated in part by an intrinsic mitochondrial pathway...|$|R
40|$|Control of {{temperature}} {{and duration of}} partial carbonization for Chinese medicines have been mainly based on experience of the processors. No quantitative methods and parameters are available {{that can be used}} to precisely control the temperature and determine the energy changes during the process. In our research, with a simulated atmosphere air condition, the partial carbonization processes of three <b>Chinese</b> herb medicines <b>rhubarb,</b> moutan and burnet were simulated at different heating rates (5, 10 and 20 °C • min- 1) and analyzed by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) to quantify the upper limits of the temperature. The activation energy was calculated with Friedman, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) method and Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW) methods in iso-conversional models and independent parallel reaction model (IPR). The upper temperatures were calculated to be 280, 184 and 246 °C for rhubarb, moutan and burnet, respectively, at corresponding conversion rates of 0. 4, 0. 2 and 0. 1. Calculation of the activation energy has been found impossible with the IPR model. Results obtained from the three iso-conversional methods were different. For rhubarb and burnet, the conversion rates at the upper temperature limits were at the highest or second highest activation energy, while for moutan, it was at the lowest value of activation energy. These results confirmed scientific rationales of traditional Chinese medicine theory that rhubarb and burnet be prepared at high temperature and moutan be prepared at medium temperature. Application of thermal analysis techniques would broaden and deepen traditional Chinese medicine research, and are applicable to the processing of medicinal materials including traditional Chinese medicines. Results obtained from the study could provide new ideas and methods for research to modernize the preparation of traditional Chinese medicines...|$|R
50|$|The species R. tanguticum and R. officinale, {{also under}} the {{categorical}} {{term of the}} Chinese drug da-huang, {{are closely related to}} R. palmatum. Today, these three species are regarded as superior in performance to other species-existing rhubarbs. Though R palmatum is commonly misinterpreted to be one in the same with the familiar R. rhabarbarum garden rhubarb we eat, there are several facets falsifying this assumption. Size is the most evident of the facets used to differentiate these two closely related species. While most garden species only grow to a mere few feet in height, <b>Chinese</b> <b>rhubarb</b> can produce as high as a “six to ten foot jointed stalk,” with loosely branched clusters of flowers along the tips that mature red in color from their often yellow or white blooms.Its leaves are rather “large, jagged and hand - shaped,” growing in width of at least two to three feet.It {{is important to recognize that}} only those species of Rheum with lobed leaves are accredited for their medicinal use. Subsequently, garden rhubarb, R. rhubarbarum, as well as any other variety of species with either “wavy” or “undulating leaves” are not founded for any medicinal purpose. Additionally, one can decipher <b>Chinese</b> <b>rhubarb</b> by its rather thick, deep roots whereas the perennial garden plant is composed predominantly of “fleshy rhizomes and buds (http://www.rhubarbinfo.com/growing).|$|E
5000|$|The {{conditions}} {{treated by}} <b>Chinese</b> <b>rhubarb</b> {{in ancient times}} are the same that {{it is used to}} treat today. The root (the predominantly medicinal part of the species) is still known for its astringent capabilities (as well as a strong laxative); “the tannins in the root caused an astringent action making it useful {{in the early stages of}} diarrhea, dysentery, and other intestinal problems." [...] It also serves as an antibacterial in its ability to treat [...] "toothaches, shingles, fevers, hypertension, burns, acute appendicitis, acute infectious hepatitis, conjunctivitis, swelling and pain of gums, and sores of the mouth or tongue." ...|$|E
50|$|Though native in {{the regions}} of western China, {{northern}} Tibet, and the Mongolian Plateau, <b>Chinese</b> <b>Rhubarb</b> was widely used {{in other parts of}} the world, such as Europe, for hundreds of years before its source of plant identity was actually discovered in the 18th century. As a consequence of these findings, today <b>Chinese</b> <b>rhubarb</b> is also found flourishing in the West and in the wild. It is extensively cultivated, no doubt for its great medicinal advantages and uses. Like all flowering plants, it is grown from the protective coat of a seed in the spring, or by “root division” in the seasons of Spring or Autumn, where the temperature is not yet too hot or too cold. A rather spacious environment where it can receive an abundance of sunlight for the production of sugars, as well as its development in “well-drained soil,” proves to be most efficient for the augmentation of this species. Since it is the roots and rhizome which serve as this plant’ source of medicinal usage, special care is taken in their preparation. When 6-10 years old, the rhizomes of these plants are removed from the ground in the Autumn when both its stems and leaves changed to yellow wild. Furthermore, the removal of the lateral rootlets and the crown are removed, leaving only the root. Any debris around the root is cleaned off, the coarse exterior bark removed, and the root cut and divided into cube-like pieces to increase its surface area, thereby decreasing the time needed for drying.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} {{clinical}} efficacy {{and safety of}} oral administration of the traditional <b>Chinese</b> herb <b>rhubarb</b> to treat acute exacerbation of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (AECOPD). Method: This was a multicenter randomized double-blinded placebo controlled study that took place in 7 provinces of China that enrolled 244 patients (aged 18 – 80 years) who had acute exacerbation of COPD with the traditional Chinese syndrome pattern of phlegm-heat obstructing lung. Participants were divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group received 4. 5  g of rhubarb granules twice daily and the control group received placebo granules. Both groups also received conventional Western therapy consisting of oxygen therapy, an antibiotic, expectorant, and a bronchodilator. Treatment lasted 10 days. Symptom scores for cough, sputum volume and color, wheezing and chest tightness before treatment and on days 3, 5, 7, and 10 during the treatment were recorded. Lung function, arterial blood gas and levels of serum inflammatory factors, interleukin- 4 (IL- 4), interleukin- 8 (IL- 8), and interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), before and after treatment were measured. Results: The sample size of the full analysis set (FAS) was 244 participants, and the sample size of per protocol set (PPS) was 235. Following 10 days' treatment, symptom scores of the experimental group were markedly lower than those of the placebo group (FAS: mean difference − 1. 67, 95 % CI: – 2. 66 to − 0. 69, P =  0. 001; PPS: mean difference − 1. 55, 95 % CI: − 2. 56 to − 0. 54, P =  0. 003). Lung function in the experimental group was significantly higher than in the placebo group (FEV 1, FAS: mean difference 0. 12, 95 % CI: 0. 06 to 0. 18; P <  0. 001; PPS: mean difference 0. 12, 95 % CI 0. 05 to 0. 18; P <  0. 001. FVC: FAS: mean difference 0. 16, 95 % CI: 0. 06 to 0. 26; P =  0. 002; PPS: mean difference 0. 16, 95 % CI 0. 05 to 0. 26; P =  0. 003. FEV 1 %, FAS: mean difference 5. 95, 95 % CI: 3. 36 to 8. 53; P <  0. 001; PPS: mean difference 5. 92, 95 % CI 3. 28 to 8. 56; P <  0. 001.). PaO 2, PaCO 2, as well as serum inflammatory factors were also improved when compared to the placebo group. There {{were no significant differences in}} the incidence rate of adverse reaction between the two groups. Conclusions: Compared with placebo, rhubarb granules significantly reduced symptom scores, improved blood oxygen level, controlled systemic inflammatory response, without significant adverse effects. Thus, rhubarb may be a beneficial adjuvant method for treating the phlegm-heat obstructing the lung syndrome pattern of AECOPD...|$|R
5000|$|Of the {{numerous}} herbs renowned for their medicinal benefits in early civilizations, <b>Chinese</b> <b>rhubarb</b> {{remains one of}} few still used today in both “conventional and herbal medicine." [...] The very first accounts are found in ancient Chinese writings, dating back to 2700 B.C... A study of Chinese history shows that it was known, even back then, for its purging effects, {{as well as its}} ability to suppress feverish conditions (Foster): it was taken by an emperor in the Liang dynasty (557-579) for fever, used as gift-bearing means to an emperor of the Tang dynasty (618-907), used to combat the plague in the years which the Song dynasty ruled (960-1127), and used as a suicidal measure by a general of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). With a variety of medicinal uses, it wasn’t long before this potent plant began making its way {{to other parts of the}} world. In fact, it became one of the most prominent items traded along the Silk Road. A rhubarb monopoly initiated in Imperial Russia in 1731, stiffly regulating its trade from “China via the Asian steppes to Moscow and St. Petersburg, where its root was shipped to the rest of Europe.". For 125 years thereafter, rhubarb-root imports were governed solely by what was known as the “Rhubarb Office.” [...] This “office” ceased to exist once China opened its ports to the Western nations, allowing for free trade. Some of the common names associated with Rheum palmatum - “Russian rhubarb”, “Turkey rhubarb,” and “Indian rhubarb” - are directly affiliated with the trade routes for rhubarb from China.|$|E

40|$|A common {{objective}} in functional data analyses is the registration of data curves and {{estimation of the}} locations of their salient structures, such as spikes or local extrema. Existing methods separate curve modeling and structure estimation into disjoint steps, optimize different criteria for estimation, or recast the problem into the testing framework. Moreover, curve registration is often implemented in a pre-processing step. The aim of this dissertation is to ameliorate the shortcomings of existing methods {{through the development of}} unified nonlinear modeling procedures for the analysis of structural functional data. A general model-based framework is proposed to unify registration and estimation of curves and their structures. In particular, this work focuses on three specific research problems. First, a Sparse Semiparametric Nonlinear Model (SSNM) is proposed to jointly register curves, perform model selection, and estimate the features of sparsely-structured functional data. The SSNM is fitted to chromatographic data from a study of the composition of <b>Chinese</b> <b>rhubarb.</b> Next, the SSNM is extended to the nonlinear mixed effects setting to enable the comparison of sparse structures across group-averaged curves. The model is utilized to compare compositions of medicinal herbs collected from two groups of production sites.

40|$|Background/Aims: Extracellular ATP {{performs}} multiple important functions via {{activation of}} P 2 receptors {{on the cell}} surface. P 2 Y receptors play critical roles in ATP evoked response in human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A 549 cells). Emodin is an anthraquinone derivative originally isolated from <b>Chinese</b> <b>rhubarb,</b> possesses anticancer properties. In this study we examined the inhibiting effects of emodin on proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by suppressing P 2 Y receptors-dependent Ca 2 + increase and nuclear factor-κB (NF-KB) signaling in A 549 cells. Methods: A 549 cells were pretreated with emodin before stimulation with ATP for the indicated time. Then, intracellular Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) was measured by Fluo- 8 /AM staining. Cell proliferation and cell cycle progression were tested by CCK 8 assay and flow cytometry In addition, wound healing and western blot were performed to determine cell migration and related protein levels (Bcl- 2, Bax, claudin- 1, NF-κB). Results: Emodin blunted ATP/UTP-induced increase of [Ca 2 +]i and cell proliferation concentration-dependently Meanwhile, it decreased ATP-induced cells accumulation in the S phase. Furthermore, emodin altered protein abundance of Bcl- 2, Bax and claudin- 1 and attenuated EMT caused by ATP. Such ATP-induced cellular reactions were also inhibited by a nonselective P 2 Y receptors antagonist, suramin, {{in a similar way}} to emodin. Besides, emodin could inhibit activation of NF-κB, thus suppressed ATP-induced proliferation, migration and EMT.
