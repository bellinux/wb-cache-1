50|$|In the {{high-temperature}} power stage, expanding {{high pressure}} hydrogen from the <b>compression</b> <b>stage</b> converts the heat energy into electrical energy via the MEA. As the high-temperature, high pressure hydrogen is forced through the PEM it is ionized, producing protons and electrons.

After passing through the PEM, the protons recombine with the electrons to produce low pressure hydrogen gas that flows out to the <b>compression</b> <b>stage.</b> From {{the perspective of the}} high-temperature stage, the load consists of the external load on the engine and the low-temperature <b>compression</b> <b>stage.</b> In the <b>compression</b> <b>stage,</b> electrical potential is applied across the MEA and forces protons to flow through the PEM to produce high pressure hydrogen. As the hydrogen travels between the stages, it passes through a heat exchanger that increases efficiency by helping to keep the high-temperature stage hot and the low-temperature stage cool.|$|E

50|$|The {{amount of}} energy {{available}} to the external load is the difference in electrical potential between that needed to compress hydrogen at low-temperature and that which expanding it at high-temperature generates.

25|$|Isothermal - This model {{assumes that}} the {{compressed}} gas remains at a constant temperature throughout the compression or expansion process. In this cycle, internal energy {{is removed from the}} system as heat at the same rate that it is added by the mechanical work of compression. Isothermal compression or expansion more closely models real life when the compressor has a large heat exchanging surface, a small gas volume, or a long time scale (i.e., a small power level). Compressors that utilize inter-stage cooling between <b>compression</b> <b>stages</b> come closest to achieving perfect isothermal compression. However, with practical devices perfect isothermal compression is not attainable. For example, unless you have an infinite number of <b>compression</b> <b>stages</b> with corresponding intercoolers, you will never achieve perfect isothermal compression.|$|R

50|$|Gas {{turbines}} take in filtered, fresh {{ambient air}} and compress {{it in the}} compressor stage. The compressed air is mixed with fuel in the combustion chamber and ignited. This produces a high-temperature and high-pressure flow of exhaust gases that enter in a turbine and produce the shaft work output that is generally used to turn an electric generator as well as powering the compressor stage.As the gas turbine is a constant volume machine, the air volume introduced in the combustion chamber after the <b>compression</b> <b>stage</b> is fixed for a given shaft speed (rpm).

50|$|One of the {{principal}} advantages the Rankine cycle holds over others is that during the <b>compression</b> <b>stage</b> relatively little work is required to drive the pump, the working fluid being in its liquid phase at this point. By condensing the fluid, the work required by the pump consumes only 1% to 3% of the turbine power and contributes to a much higher efficiency for a real cycle. The benefit of this is lost somewhat due to the lower heat addition temperature. Gas turbines, for instance, have turbine entry temperatures approaching 1500 °C. Nonetheless, the efficiencies of actual large steam cycles and large modern gas turbines are fairly well matched.|$|E

As it turns out, other factors come into play and dominate during this compression cycle.

40|$|The cyclic {{triaxial}} test {{is the most}} widely used way to measure the cyclic stress strain properties of saturated soils because of its availability in most geotechnical laboratories. Further, it {{can be viewed as a}} suitable tool with which to analyze the cyclic behavior of unsaturated soils in a wide strain range. In this study, a new stress path suction-controlled cyclic triaxial device is presented. It is fitted for suction-controlled testing by the axis-translation technique. Pore-air and pore-water pressures are applied at the top and bottom of the specimen by using two electro-pneumatic regulators. The capability of the new apparatus is demonstrated in this paper with the results of some suction-controlled cyclic {{triaxial test}}s.

5000|$|If digital {{components}} are being used, latency {{must be taken}} into account. If the normal analog method is used for a digital compressor, the signals traveling through the parallel pathways will arrive at the summing mixer at slightly different times, creating unpleasant comb-filtering and phasing effects. The digital compressor pathway takes a little more time to process the sound—on the order of 0.3 to 3 milliseconds longer. Instead, the two pathways must both have the same number of processing stages: the [...] "straight" [...] pathway is assigned a <b>compression</b> <b>stage</b> which is not given an aggressively high ratio.

5000|$|Recuperator - If the Brayton {{cycle is}} run {{at a low}} {{pressure}} ratio and a high temperature increase in the combustion chamber, the exhaust gas (after the last turbine stage) might still be hotter than the compressed inlet gas (after the last <b>compression</b> <b>stage</b> but before the combustor). In that case, a heat exchanger {{can be used to}} transfer thermal energy from the exhaust to the already compressed gas, before it enters the combustion chamber. The thermal energy transferred is effectively reused, thus increasing efficiency. However, this form of heat recycling is only possible if the engine is run in a low-efficiency mode with low pressure ratio in the first place. Transferring heat from the outlet (after the last turbine) to the inlet (before the first compressor stage) would reduce efficiency, as hotter inlet air means more volume, thus more work for the compressor. For engines with liquid cryogenic fuels, namely hydrogen, it might be feasible, though, to use the fuel to cool the inlet air before compression to increase efficiency. This concept is extensively studied for the SABRE engine.|$|E
