25|$|The pacinian <b>corpuscle</b> is {{one such}} structure. It has {{concentric}} layers like an onion, which form around the axon terminal. When pressure is applied and the <b>corpuscle</b> is deformed, mechanical stimulus is transferred to the axon, which fires. If the pressure is steady, {{there is no more}} stimulus; thus, typically these neurons respond with a transient depolarization during the initial deformation and again when the pressure is removed, which causes the <b>corpuscle</b> to change shape again. Other types of adaptation are important in extending the function of a number of other neurons.|$|E

In nutria, the genesis of Hassall’s <b>corpuscles</b> is more rapid than in most mammals. The <b>corpuscles</b> showed extended polymorphism, from round <b>corpuscles</b> to very particular forms, even odd, in some cases. The degenerated reticulo-epithelial cells represent the starting point in Hassall’s <b>corpuscles</b> formation. They ensure the growth of Hassall’s <b>corpuscles</b> and their adhesion to the reticulo-epithelial network, as well as the binding of two or more adjacent <b>corpuscles.</b> In a more advanced stage, increase in size of the joint <b>corpuscles</b> reduce the separating spaces up to absence, resulting <b>corpuscles</b> that appear like entities of 5 - 10 joint <b>corpuscles,</b> in different stages of organization.

2500|$|Fatio {{thought for}} a long time that, since <b>corpuscles</b> {{approach}} material bodies at a higher speed than they recede from them (after reflection), there would be a progressive accumulation of <b>corpuscles</b> near material bodies (an effect which he called [...] "condensation"). However, he later realized that although the incoming <b>corpuscles</b> are quicker, they are spaced further apart than are the reflected <b>corpuscles,</b> so the inward and outward flow rates are the same. Hence there is no secular accumulation of <b>corpuscles,</b> i.e., the density of the reflected <b>corpuscles</b> remains constant (assuming that they are small enough that no noticeably greater rate of self-collision occurs near the massive body). More importantly, Fatio noted that, by increasing both the velocity and the elasticity of the <b>corpuscles,</b> the difference between the speeds of the incoming and reflected <b>corpuscles</b> (and hence the difference in densities) can be made arbitrarily small while still maintaining the same effective gravitational force.|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of this}} project {{was to determine whether}} or not there is coevolution between apple snails (Family: Ampullariidae) and their putative endosymbionts, C and K <b>corpuscles,</b> found in their digestive gland and feces. These <b>corpuscles</b> had been described in detail for one species of apple snail, Pomacea canaliculata with preliminary findings in Pomacea insularum, Pomacea scalaris, and Asolene pulchella. In addition to Pomacea canaliculata, two species of apple snails can be found in Hawaii, Pila conica, introduced to Molokai, and Asolene spixii, sold as an aquarium pet. This study looked for the presence of <b>corpuscles</b> in these two additional species and compared/contrasted their morphological features to <b>corpuscles</b> from Pomacea canaliculata. Initial analyses of the corpuscles' morphology via light microscopy confirmed the presence of C and K <b>corpuscles</b> in Pila conica and Asolene spixii. However, light, confocal, and transmission electron micrographs revealed additional characteristics that were not reported in previous studies suggesting that the <b>corpuscles</b> were endosymbiotic and resembled cyanobacteria. The newly described morphological and chemical features of the <b>corpuscles</b> seem to suggest that the <b>corpuscles</b> are not cyanobacteria and may not be endosymbiotic. Thus this study changed focus to improving the description of <b>corpuscles</b> in relation to their surrounding tissues and developing hypotheses for how <b>corpuscles</b> originate...|$|R

25|$|Newtonian optics was {{generally}} accepted {{until the early}} 19th century when Thomas Young and Augustin-Jean Fresnel conducted experiments on the interference of light that firmly established light's wave nature. Young's famous double slit experiment showed that light followed the law of superposition, which is a wave-like property not predicted by Newton's <b>corpuscle</b> theory. This work led to a theory of diffraction for light and opened an entire area of study in physical optics. Wave optics was successfully unified with electromagnetic theory by James Clerk Maxwell in the 1860s.|$|E
25|$|In April 1897, Thomson {{had only}} early {{indications}} that the cathode rays could be deflected electrically (previous investigators such as Heinrich Hertz had thought they could not be). A month after Thomson's announcement of the <b>corpuscle,</b> he found that he could reliably deflect the rays by an electric field if he evacuated the discharge tube to a very low pressure. By comparing the deflection of a beam of cathode rays by electric and magnetic fields he obtained more robust measurements of the mass-to-charge ratio that confirmed his previous estimates. This became the classic means of measuring the charge and mass of the electron.|$|E

Scattered <b>corpuscles</b> were found in contact with the periosteum of distal and middle phalanges and with flexor tendon sheath, and in the dermis of the palm. <b>Corpuscles</b> were observed to be clustered in the skin folds of the toes.

50|$|Lamellar <b>corpuscles,</b> or Pacinian <b>corpuscles,</b> {{are one of}} {{the four}} major types of {{mechanoreceptor}} cell in glabrous mammalian skin. They are nerve endings in the skin responsible for sensitivity to vibration and pressure. They respond only to sudden disturbances and are especially sensitive to vibration. The vibrational role may be used to detect surface texture, e.g., rough vs. smooth. Lamellar <b>corpuscles</b> are also found in the pancreas, where they detect vibration and possibly very low frequency sounds. Lamellar <b>corpuscles</b> act as very rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors. Groups of <b>corpuscles</b> respond to pressure changes, e.g. on grasping or releasing an object.|$|R
25|$|The substance, or parenchyma, of {{the kidney}} {{is divided into}} two major {{structures}}: the outer renal cortex and the inner renal medulla. Grossly, these structures take the shape of eight to 18 cone-shaped renal lobes, each containing renal cortex surrounding a portion of medulla called a renal pyramid. Between the renal pyramids are projections of cortex called renal columns. Nephrons, the urine-producing functional structures of the kidney, span the cortex and medulla. The initial filtering portion of a nephron is the renal <b>corpuscle</b> which is located in the cortex. This is followed by a renal tubule that passes from the cortex deep into the medullary pyramids. Part of the renal cortex, a medullary ray is a collection of renal tubules that drain into a single collecting duct.|$|E
25|$|Optical theory progressed in the mid-17th {{century with}} treatises written by philosopher René Descartes, which {{explained}} {{a variety of}} optical phenomena including reflection and refraction by assuming that light was emitted by objects which produced it. This differed substantively from the ancient Greek emission theory. In the late 1660s and early 1670s, Isaac Newton expanded Descartes' ideas into a <b>corpuscle</b> theory of light, famously determining that white light was a mix of colours which can be separated into its component parts with a prism. In 1690, Christiaan Huygens proposed a wave theory for light based on suggestions {{that had been made}} by Robert Hooke in 1664. Hooke himself publicly criticised Newton's theories of light and the feud between the two lasted until Hooke's death. In 1704, Newton published Opticks and, at the time, partly because of his success in other areas of physics, he was generally considered to be the victor in the debate over the nature of light.|$|E
500|$|Guided {{by similar}} motivations as his former partner, Foucault in 1850 was more {{interested}} in settling the particle-versus-wave debate than in determining an accurate absolute value for the speed of light. Foucault measured the differential speed of light through air versus water by inserting a tube filled with water between the rotating mirror and the distant mirror. His experimental results, announced shortly before Fizeau announced his results on the same topic, were viewed as [...] "driving the last nail in the coffin" [...] of Newton's <b>corpuscle</b> theory of light when it showed that light travels more slowly through water than through air. Newton had explained refraction as a pull of the medium upon the light, implying an increased speed of light in the medium. The corpuscular theory of light went into abeyance, completely overshadowed by wave theory. This state of affairs lasted until 1905, when Einstein presented heuristic arguments that under various circumstances, such as when considering the photoelectric effect, light exhibits behaviors indicative of a particle nature.|$|E

2500|$|In sensory neurons, an {{external}} signal such as pressure, temperature, light, or sound is {{coupled with the}} opening and closing of ion channels, which in turn alter the ionic permeabilities of the membrane and its voltage. These voltage changes can again be excitatory (depolarizing) or inhibitory (hyperpolarizing) and, in some sensory neurons, their combined effects can depolarize the axon hillock enough to provoke action potentials. [...] Examples in humans include the olfactory receptor neuron and Meissner's <b>corpuscle,</b> which are critical for the sense of smell and touch, respectively. [...] However, not all sensory neurons convert their external signals into action potentials; some do not even have an axon! Instead, they may convert the signal into {{the release of a}} neurotransmitter, or into continuous graded potentials, either of which may stimulate subsequent neuron(s) into firing an action potential. [...] For illustration, in the human ear, hair cells convert the incoming sound into the opening and closing of mechanically gated ion channels, which may cause neurotransmitter molecules to be released. In similar manner, in the human retina, the initial photoreceptor cells and the next layer of cells (comprising bipolar cells and horizontal cells) do not produce action potentials; only some amacrine cells and the third layer, the ganglion cells, produce action potentials, which then travel up the optic nerve.|$|E
