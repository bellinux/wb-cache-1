Ten functions were fitted, including commonly used models for diameter distribution as well as other recently developed models applied to forest science. Selection criteria included Kolmogorov-Smirnov adherence test, standard error of estimate in percentage and adjusted coefficient of determination. Three <b>class</b> <b>intervals</b> were used as obtained by Sturges, Dixon & Kronmal, and Velleman criteria.

40|$|This {{book has}} eleven chapters. Chapter one {{describes}} {{all types of}} natural <b>class</b> of <b>intervals</b> and the arithmetic operations on them. Chapter two introduces the semigroup of natural <b>class</b> of <b>intervals</b> using R or Zn and study the properties associated with them. Chapter three studies the notion of rings constructed using the natural <b>class</b> of <b>intervals.</b> Matrix theory using the special <b>class</b> of <b>intervals</b> is analyzed in chapter four of this book. Chapter five deals with polynomials using interval coefficients. New types of rings of natural intervals are introduced and studied in chapter six. The notion of vector space using natural <b>class</b> of <b>intervals</b> is built in chapter seven. In chapter eight fuzzy natural <b>class</b> of <b>intervals</b> are introduced and algebraic structures on them is built and described. Algebraic structures using natural <b>class</b> of neutrosophic <b>intervals</b> are developed in chapter nine. Chapter ten suggests some possible applications. The final chapter proposes over 200 problems of which some are at research level and some difficult and others are simple. Comment: 170 pages; Published by The Educational Publisher Inc in 201...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} work was to obtain a preliminary legend of a soil map and to compare the preliminary map with maps made by the traditional soil survey methods. The area has 59 hectares and is located at a mountainous relief in the Atlantic Plateau. The original soil map of this area was made at 1 : 10 000. A digital elevation model (DEM) was generated with 4 m spatial resolution based on a topographical map at 1 : 10 000 scale, where the level curves are equidistant at 5 m. Based on the DEM we generated altitude, curvature and slope maps. In order to map the hydromorphic soils it was generated a buffer around the hydrography. We also calculated frequency distribution graphics of altitude, curvature and slope maps. After {{the interpretation of the}} frequency distribution, we defined classes to predict the soils types. The curvature map was divided into two <b>class</b> <b>intervals</b> (0), the altitude map was divided into four <b>class</b> <b>intervals</b> (690, 703, 704, 714, 715, 730, and 731, 757 m), and the slope map was divided into four <b>class</b> <b>intervals</b> (0 - 9, 10 - 19, 20 - 44, and 45 - 72 %). The maps were reclassified and converted to shape files. The shape files were intersected with the others to generate the final preliminary soil map.

40|$|A {{data set}} often {{comprises}} some data classes. For example, a gray-scale image may consist of some objects, {{each of which}} has similar pixels' gray-scales. The threshold obtained by Otsu's thresholding method (OTM) is biased towards certain data class with larger variance or larger number of data when the variances or the numbers of data among classes are quite different. In this paper, Adaptable Threshold Detector (ATD) is proposed to improve the effectiveness of OTM in determining proper thresholds by dividing class variance by <b>class</b> <b>interval.</b> ATD is more versatile at selecting application-dependent thresholds by changing two parameter values which describe the relative importance among data size, standard deviation, and <b>class</b> <b>interval</b> of a class. In this paper, ATD is applied to crop the expected objects from images to verify its effect upon thresholding. Experimental results demonstrate that ATD is able to perform better than OTM in segmenting objects from images, besides excelling over the Valley-Emphasis Method (VEM) and the Minimum Class Variance Thresholding Method (MCVTM). ATD is also suitable for separating objects from serialized video images, i. e. computerized tomography. Crown Copyright (c) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
