A type of diamond called <b>carbonado</b> that is found in South America and Africa may have been deposited there via an asteroid impact (not formed from the impact) about 3billion years ago.

25|$|After passing <b>Carbonado</b> and {{receiving}} the tributary Lily Creek, the river valley broadens {{again and the}} Carbon River resumes its generally braided and meandering pattern. It turns west, flowing through an increasingly broad floodplain {{to the town of}} Crocker, where the river is joined by one of its main tributaries, South Prairie Creek. Just below Crocker another major tributary, Voight Creek, joins.|$|E
25|$|Formed by glacial meltwater, the Carbon River {{contains}} {{a heavy load}} of sediment such as silt and gravel. After emerging from the Carbon Glacier the Carbon River flows through a broad glacier-carved valley where thick sediment deposits in the stream bed create sand and gravel bars causing the river to become complexly braided, meandering, and flood-prone. The river frequently shifts channels and creates new ones in its valley. Between Fairfax and <b>Carbonado</b> the Carbon River flows through a narrow gorge (right) before emerging into another broad flood-prone valley near Crocker and Orting.|$|E

In Spring 1945 the Chinese launched offensives that retook Hunan and Guangxi. With the Chinese army progressing well in training and equipment, Wedemeyer planned to launch Operation <b>Carbonado</b> in summer 1945 to retake Guangdong, thus obtaining a coastal port, and from there drive northwards toward Shanghai. However, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Soviet invasion of Manchuria hastened Japanese surrender and these plans were not put into action.|$|E

50|$|Two {{theories}} {{have been suggested}} for {{the origin of the}} Bangui anomaly, neither being conclusive. One attributes it to a large igneous intrusion and the other to a meteorite impact in the Precambrian (before 540 Ma). To support the latter theory, an analogy was drawn with a meteorite impact that may have occurred in Brazil in Bahia state causing formation of <b>carbonados</b> (black diamond aggregates) which are only found in the Central African Republic and Brazil.|$|R
500|$|The {{faces of}} diamond octahedrons are highly lustrous owing to their hardness; {{triangular}} shaped growth defects (trigons) or etch pits are often {{present on the}} faces. A diamond's fracture may be step-like, conchoidal (shell-like, similar to glass) or irregular. Diamonds which are nearly round, due {{to the formation of}} multiple steps on octahedral faces, are commonly coated in a gum-like skin (nyf). The combination of stepped faces, growth defects, and nyf produces a [...] "scaly" [...] or corrugated appearance. Many diamonds are so distorted that few crystal faces are discernible. Some diamonds found in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are polycrystalline and occur as opaque, darkly colored, spherical, radial masses of tiny crystals; these are known as ballas and are important to industry as they lack the cleavage planes of single-crystal diamond. <b>Carbonado</b> is a similar opaque microcrystalline form which occurs in shapeless masses. Like ballas diamond, <b>carbonado</b> lacks cleavage planes and its specific gravity varies widely from 2.9 to 3.5. Bort diamonds, found in Brazil, Venezuela, and Guyana, are {{the most common type of}} industrial-grade diamond. They are also polycrystalline and often poorly crystallized; they are translucent and cleave easily.|$|E
500|$|Nitrogen {{is by far}} {{the most}} common {{impurity}} found in gem diamonds and is responsible for the yellow and brown color in diamonds. Boron is responsible for the blue color. Color in diamond has two additional sources: irradiation (usually by alpha particles), that causes the color in green diamonds, and plastic deformation of the diamond crystal lattice. Plastic deformation is the cause of color in some brown and perhaps pink and red diamonds. In order of increasing rarity, yellow diamond is followed by brown, colorless, then by blue, green, black, pink, orange, purple, and red. [...] "Black", or <b>Carbonado,</b> diamonds are not truly black, but rather contain numerous dark inclusions that give the gems their dark appearance. Colored diamonds contain impurities or structural defects that cause the coloration, while pure or nearly pure diamonds are transparent and colorless. Most diamond impurities replace a carbon atom in the crystal lattice, known as a carbon flaw. The most common impurity, nitrogen, causes a slight to intense yellow coloration depending upon the type and concentration of nitrogen present. The Gemological Institute of America (GIA) classifies low saturation yellow and brown diamonds as diamonds in the normal color range, and applies a grading scale from [...] "D" [...] (colorless) to [...] "Z" [...] (light yellow). Diamonds of a different color, such as blue, are called fancy colored diamonds and fall under a different grading scale.|$|E

50|$|By the 1920s, {{about half}} of the Company's {{drilling}} was outside the continental United States. Robert Longyear (E.J.’s son) became president of the firm in 1924, preserving the chain of family ownership and management that would continue for another 40 years. In 1929, Longyear sold almost US$1.5 million worth of drilling equipment to other drillers. The following year the company formed its first foreign subsidiary in Canada. The company also signed its first contract for work in Africa, sending equipment and a crew to provide drilling for copper ores. However, the stock market crash of October 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression reduced earnings to $79,000 in 1933. During the 1930s, Longyear took on a project drilling for core samples for the proposed Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. In spite of the financial crisis, the 1930s saw improvements in diamond drilling technology, including the use of industrial-quality diamonds mined in Africa that were called “boarts.” In 1936, South Africa’s Anglo American Corporation formed Boart Products South Africa (Pty) Limited, which was later named Boart International. The new company developed the first mechanically-set diamond core bits, which were less expensive than the hand-set core bits that used more expensive Brazilian diamonds (<b>carbonados).</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{noble gas}} {{geochemistry}} {{of different types}} of terrestrial diamond including coated stones, alluvial diamonds, framesites, <b>carbonados</b> and impact diamonds yields a wealth of information on the sources of volatiles responsible for diamond formation. We present an illustrated compilation of published analyses of noble gases in different types of natural diamond. Noble gases in diamond record primary signatures from the mantle indicative of their integrated sources, and, the contribution of different metasomatic agents including subducting fluids and kimberlitic melt sampled during diamond growth. In addition, they show evidence of secondary processes such as resorption. Most data are available for coated stones, which trap abundant volatile-rich microscopic inclusions in their rims. While the coated stones are dominated by Mid-Oceanic-Ridge-Basalt (MORB) type noble gas signatures, the other diamond types contain predominantly crustal and atmospheric components although some mantle gases may be present, the latter indicated in elevated 20 Ne/ 22 Ne and/or 129 Xe/ 132 Xe ratios relative to atmospheric values. Some alluvial diamonds have very high 3 He/ 4 He that may represent the presence of a solar component trapped during their formation, but are just as likely {{to be the result of}} cosmogenic 3 He implantation during their prolonged residence at the Earth's surface. Oceanic-Island-Basalt (OIB) type noble gases occur in nanometer sized inclusions in metamorphic diamond from Kazakhstan, yet their significance as a fingerprint of mantle processes is not fully understood. Implanted noble gases occur near the outer surfaces of individual crystals, and are generally not a major hindrance for the study of mantle signatures, except for polycrystalline diamond like framesites with small grain size. Some diamonds including the polycrystalline <b>carbonados,</b> are dominated by crustal noble gases with no discernible mantle component evidenced by very low 3 He/ 4 He and 20 Ne/ 22 Ne ratios, and very high 21 Ne/ 22 Ne and 131, 134, 136 Xe/ 132 Xe ratios. In many diamonds, variations in both concentration and isotopic composition within samples from the same geographical location require complex diamond growth. For example, coated stones of Zaire trap noble gases from multiple sources and different generations of diamond growth. Thus noble gas studies have the potential to record major processes during the complex growth histories of natural diamond and also to provide valuable information about the sub-continental mantle. Noble gas signatures may be affected by diffusive losses, notably in some framesites. Lastly, we discuss the future trend and scope of noble gas studies in diamond combining noble gas analyses with other elements including trace elements and halogens, and in situ 40 Ar- 39 Ar age determinations to constrain the entrapment and diamond growth age. A key to greater understanding lies in systematic pre-analytical sample characterisation and treatment. This includes core-rim separation for coated stones, removal of the outer 25 μm to remove implanted gases, analysis of fluid inclusion density, and characterised heterogeneity using optical microscope to identify resorption and alteration...|$|R
30|$|Some {{environmental}} conditions (moisture content, aeration rate, pH, and temperature) and substrate characteristics (C/N ratio, particle size, bulking agents, nutrients contents, and free air space) affect {{the composting process}} (Iqbal et al. [2010]). Selection of a bulking agent which should be inexpensive and readily available {{in the vicinity of}} the composting region is very important because bulking agents can affect the condition of the starting composting mixtures, biodegradation kinetics and composting performance as well as the final compost quality (Blanco and Almendros [1995]; Chang and Chen [2010]; Jolanun and Towprayoon [2010]). Bulking agents have different properties because of their carbon source, physical shape, particle size, water absorption capacity, and their bulking density (Iqbal et al. [2010]). Bulking agents are usually fibrous and <b>carbonadoes</b> material with low moisture content; therefore they can absorb part of the leachate produced during decomposition to keep the moisture and sustain the microbial activity (Adhikari et al. [2008]; Dias et al. [2010]; Iqbal et al. [2010]). The bulking agent provides structural support to prevent physical compaction, promotes porosity and air void, and improves the compost aeration and gas exchange (Adhikari et al. [2008]; Yañez et al. [2009]; Dias et al. [2010]; Doublet et al. [2011]). It can also act as a buffer against the organic acids in the early stages of composting and help maintain the mixture’s pH within a range from 6 – 8 for proper microbial activity (Haug [1993]), and adjust C/N ratio of the feedstock and encourage microbial activity without inhabitation (Jolanun and Towprayoon [2010]). Numerous studies have used different bulking agents, which are mostly from agriculture byproducts. They include sawdust (Martin et al. [1993]; Blanco and Almendros [1995]; Banegas et al. [2007]; Adhikari et al. [2008]; Chang and Chen [2010]; Yang et al. [2013]), wheat straw (Blanco and Almendros [1995]; Banegas et al. [2007]), hay and pine wood shaving (Banegas et al. [2007]), bagasse and paper (Adhikari et al. [2008]), rice husk and rice barn (Chang and Chen [2010]), wooden palette (Huet et al. [2012]), cornstalks and spent mushroom substrate (Yang et al. [2013]), wheat flour (Silva et al. [2014]), peat (Mathur et al. [1986]; Mathur et al. [1990]; Martin et al. [1993]; Vuorinen [2000]; Nolan et al. [2011]), and barley straw (Vuorinen [2000]).|$|R
