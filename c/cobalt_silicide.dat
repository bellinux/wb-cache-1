It is shown that although thinner cobalt suicide can result in excellent gate dielec-tric integrity it also leads to worse thermal stability at a high annealing temperature. Moreover, shallower implantation depth and lower annealing temperatuce can reduce the boron penetration, but depletion effects in polycrystalline silicon gates are caused accordingly. Hence, appropriate process conditions, involving trade-offs among CoSi., thickness, implan-tation energy and annealing temperature, must be used to optimize the device performance while retaining the thin dielectric reliability...|$|E

The experimental data indicate that the Co 2 Si phase tends to form at low temperatures and emits only extremely weak signal. The CoSi phase is stable at temperatures lower than 500 degreesC but transforms to the CoSi 2 phase at 550 degreesC. Two kinds of mechanisms were proposed: one is the diffusion-limited formation occurring at low temperatures (650 degreesC), where phase transformation is so fast that the CoSi phase is practically impossible to be observed with Raman.

By substrate curvature measurements, x-ray diffraction, and Auger electron spectroscopy, a detailed reaction sequence for, the Co(90 nm) /Ni(9 nm) /Si(001) system annealed at a ramp rate of 5 degreesC/min is revealed. For the relatively thick Ni interlayer, the reaction sequence began {{with the formation of}} Ni 2 Si and was followed by the formation of Co 2 Si on top of the Ni 2 Si. As the temperature rose, the layer of Ni 2 Si transformed into NiSi and the formation of CoSi occurred quickly. After, the occurrence of the (NixCo 1 -x) Si- 2 phase began at the interface of NiSi/CoSi. The initial phase formation of <b>cobalt</b> <b>silicides</b> occurred via the diffusion of Si through the layer of nickel silicides.

Nitrogen-doped <b>cobalt</b> <b>silicide</b> (CoSixNy) film is sputtered from <b>cobalt</b> <b>silicide</b> (CoSi 2) target in Ar/N- 2 discharge. Stress and sheet resistance of CoSixNy film are two major properties to be evaluated. Taguchi method is practiced in reactive sputtering deposition of CoSixNy film. Process pressure is most critical to the CoSixNy film stress and the optimum condition of 1000 W, 0. 8 Pa, and 20 % N- 2 flow ratio, indeed results in low tensile CoSixNy film stress, about 54. MPa. Reannealing process indicates that stability of CoSixNy film is attained after first annealing process. Stress hysteresis behaviors of CoSix and CoSixNy films resemble that of metal film with a complete elastic manner in the second stage of heating and cooling. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses suggest that toughness and strength of the film is achievable.

40|$|The {{solid-phase}} {{reaction of}} 5 Å of Co with the Si (111) surface is investigated by {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} (STM) {{in the range from}} room temperature to 700 °C. Room-temperature deposition leads to a granular film surface. The small grains transform upon annealing between 200 and 300 °C into triangular surface terraces with step heights of 1. 5 and 3. 1 Å. Further annealing up to 500 °C leads to their growth and a decrease of the relative number of 1. 5 Å steps. These observations are explained by the formation of a <b>cobalt</b> <b>silicide</b> with a CsCl-type lattice. Furthermore, apart from the known 2 × 2 reconstructions and the unreconstructed surface, various surface features like individual double-line-shaped defects and steps with a height of 0. 4 Å are resolved. Finally, the formation of pinholes is observed after annealing at 500 °C. They lead upon further annealing to a complicated pinhole-induced CoSi 2 network that breaks up into individual islands at ~ 700 °C. ...|$|E
40|$|Suicides {{have been}} used in {{industry}} since minimum dimensions reached the 1 ~tm node. The goal of this project is to explore Titanium and <b>Cobalt</b> <b>Silicide</b> and incorporate its use into the JUT sub-micron CMOS process. TiSi 2 had been the industry standard to decrease this resistivity through the 0. 25 μm node. The current industry standard is CoSi 2, with resistivity independent of its grain size. This allows for the smaller dimensions. However, CoSi 2 formation is very sensitive to oxygen contamination. A Ti capping layer may minimize the contamination by reacting with any oxygen. The nitrogen implant prior to metal deposition should suppress agglomeration in the films and improve thermal stability. A Transmission Line Model (TLM) structure has been used to extract specific contact resistivity and contact resistance for the suicide. Four point probing will measure the resistivity of the polycide. Results show a reduction in sheet resistance of polysilicon samples after silicidation. RBS and XRD analyses show oxygen contamination...|$|E
