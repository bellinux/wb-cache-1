5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Halloween had turned into a night of vandalism, with {{destruction}} of property and <b>cruelty</b> <b>to</b> <b>animals</b> and people.

When Tennessee's first Society for the Prevention of <b>Cruelty</b> <b>to</b> <b>Animals</b> and Children was formed in 1880, he became its first vice-president, and in 1889, he led the fundraising for Memphis's first civilian hospital, St. Joseph's, a Catholic institution. He founded Memphis's Hebrew Relief Association, and the non-sectarian United Charities, and was {{a director of the}} New Orleans Jewish Orphans' Home, Denver's Jewish Consumptive House, and New York's Sheltering House Association. For the last fifteen years of his life he worked to create a home for elderly and infirm Southern Jews, completed in 1927.|$|E

5|$|Since its {{original}} release, Cannibal Holocaust {{has been the}} target of censorship by moral and animal activists. Other than graphic gore, the film contains several scenes of sexual violence and genuine <b>cruelty</b> <b>to</b> <b>animals,</b> issues which find Cannibal Holocaust in the midst of controversy to this day. Due to this notoriety, Cannibal Holocaust has been marketed as having been banned in over 50 countries. In 2006, Entertainment Weekly magazine named Cannibal Holocaust as the 20th most controversial film of all time.|$|E

In addition, the president is to act as the government's chief (albeit informal) advisor on scientific matters. Yet another task is that of entertaining distinguished foreign guests and scientists.|$|E

5|$|After much delay (two of its ten members {{died and}} several fell ill), the {{commission}} reported its findings in March 1912. Its 139-page report recommended {{an increase in}} the number of full-time inspectors from two to four; restrictions on the use of curare, a poison used to immobilize animals during experiments; the euthanasia of animals in severe pain, even if it meant frustrating the experiment; and the tightening of the definition and practice of pithing. It also recommended the maintenance of more detailed records and the establishment of a committee to advise the Secretary of State on matters related to the <b>Cruelty</b> <b>to</b> <b>Animals</b> Act. The latter became the Animal Procedures Committee under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.|$|E
5|$|Cockfighting {{is said to}} be the world's oldest spectator {{sport and}} may have {{originated}} in Persia 6,000 years ago. Two mature males (cocks or roosters) are set to fight each other, and will do so with great vigour until one is critically injured or killed. Breeds such as the Aseel were developed in the Indian subcontinent for their aggressive behaviour. The sport formed part of the culture of the ancient Indians, Chinese, Greeks, and Romans, and large sums were won or lost depending on the outcome of an encounter. Cockfighting has been banned in many countries during the last century on the grounds of <b>cruelty</b> <b>to</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|E
5|$|From January to April 2009, the Scottish Government {{conducted}} a trial translocation of Eurasian sparrowhawks from around racing pigeon lofts in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Kilmarnock, Stirling and Dumfries. The trial, which cost Â£25,000, {{was supported by}} the Scottish Homing Union, representing the country's 3,500 pigeon fanciers. The experiment was originally scheduled for early in 2008 but was postponed because it would have impinged on the birds' breeding season. It was criticised by the government's own ecological adviser, Dr Ian Bainbridge, the government body Scottish Natural Heritage and organisations including the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Scottish Society for Prevention of <b>Cruelty</b> <b>to</b> <b>Animals.</b>|$|E

These three cats, a pair {{of male and female}} kittens from the same litter and another young female, were the foundation used to establish the Singapura. The breed takes its name from the Malay name for Singapore. In 1981 a breeder visited Singapore and chanced upon a cat fitting the profile of the Singapura (with the exception of the tail) in the local Society for the Prevention of <b>Cruelty</b> <b>to</b> <b>Animals.</b> The cat was imported to the US and adopted into the breeding program.|$|E
5|$|In March 1911, {{the captain}} of Saratoga, Cleveland Downs, faced legal {{difficulties}} regarding the way live turtles were stored aboard while being imported to market. Downs was arrested in New York on charges of <b>cruelty</b> <b>to</b> <b>animals</b> because the turtles had been stored upside down, with flippers lashed to one another; Miller contended that this was standard practice and asked that the charges be dropped. A later Saratoga captain also faced legal troubles, when, in June 1912, Frank L. Miller was arrested by Sheriff Julius Harburger in New York and forced to post a $500 appearance bond in a civil suit involving a former crewman. Millerâs arrest delayed {{the departure of the}} ship by two hours.|$|E
5|$|Opposition {{to the use}} {{of animals}} in medical {{research}} first arose in the United States during the 1860s, when Henry Bergh founded the American Society for the Prevention of <b>Cruelty</b> <b>to</b> <b>Animals</b> (ASPCA), with America's first specifically anti-vivisection organization being the American AntiVivisection Society (AAVS), founded in 1883. Antivivisectionists of the era generally believed the spread of mercy was the great cause of civilization, and vivisection was cruel. However, in the USA the antivivisectionists' efforts were defeated in every legislature, overwhelmed by the superior organization and influence of the medical community. Overall, this movement had little legislative success until the passing of the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act, in 1966.|$|E

40|$|This {{rigorous}} thesis analyzes {{in detail}} the legislation relating {{to the protection of}} animals in human care. It is divided into four chapters. The first chapter is dedicated to ethical and legal history of animal's protection and describes the basic terms including animal welfare. The second chapter deals with the legal sources of this protection at international, European and Czech level. The conventions of the Council of Europe concerning the protection of animals in human care are mentioned. The protection of animals {{has become one of the}} priorities of the Europen Union and also the new strategy for improving their living conditions was adopted. Czech legal history of animal protection is mentioned too. The thesis refers to Czech legislation of this area including latest novelization.

5|$|Sputnik 2 was not {{designed}} to be retrievable, and Laika had always been intended to die.

In the United Kingdom, the National Canine Defence League called on all dog owners to observe a minute's silence, while the Royal Society for the Prevention of <b>Cruelty</b> <b>to</b> <b>Animals</b> (RSPCA) received protests even before Radio Moscow had finished announcing the launch. Animal rights groups at the time called on {{members of the public}} to protest at Soviet embassies. Others demonstrated outside the United Nations in New York; nevertheless, laboratory researchers in the U.S. offered some support for the Soviets, at least before the news of Laika's death.|$|E
5|$|The film faced similar {{censorship}} {{problems for}} its theatrical release in the United Kingdom, {{where it was}} released as Zumbalah. In 1976, nearly 10 minutes were cut before it was passed with an X-rating by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). Various scenes of animal cruelty, a race between cheetahs and ostriches, the lion attack, and the mercenaries' hunt of Amazonian natives were all cut from the British release. The scenes of animal cruelty were targeted by the Royal Society for the Prevention of <b>Cruelty</b> <b>to</b> <b>Animals</b> (RSPCA) to be cut from the film, specifically the hunt and disembowelment of a puma. Also in 1976, the Valtion elokuvatarkastamo, the Finnish film classification board, banned the film in Finland in its entirety {{for the inclusion of}} scenes of genuine human death.|$|E
5|$|Asian {{elephants}} perform {{tasks such}} as hauling loads into remote areas, moving logs to rivers and roads, transporting tourists around national parks, pulling wagons, and leading religious processions. In northern Thailand, the animals are used to digest coffee beans for Black Ivory coffee. They are valued over mechanised tools because they can work in relatively deep water, require relatively little maintenance, need only vegetation and water as fuel and can be trained to memorise specific tasks. Elephants can be trained to respond to over 30 commands. Musth bulls can be difficult and dangerous {{to work with and}} are chained and semi-starved until the condition passes. In India, many working elephants are alleged to have been subject to abuse. They and other captive elephants are thus protected under The Prevention of <b>Cruelty</b> <b>to</b> <b>Animals</b> Act of 1960.|$|E
