5|$|The {{energy in}} {{sunlight}} is captured by plants, cyanobacteria, purple bacteria, green sulfur bacteria and some protists. This process is often coupled to {{the conversion of}} carbon dioxide into organic compounds, as part of photosynthesis, which is discussed below. The energy capture and <b>carbon</b> <b>fixation</b> systems can however operate separately in prokaryotes, as purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria can use sunlight {{as a source of}} energy, while switching between <b>carbon</b> <b>fixation</b> and the fermentation of organic compounds.|$|E
5|$|Photo{{synthesis}} is {{the synthesis}} of carbohydrates from sunlight and carbon dioxide (CO2). In plants, cyanobacteria and algae, oxygenic photosynthesis splits water, with oxygen produced as a waste product. This process uses the ATP and NADPH produced by the photosynthetic reaction centres, as described above, to convert CO2 into glycerate 3-phosphate, which can then be converted into glucose. This carbon-fixation reaction is {{carried out by the}} enzyme RuBisCO as part of the Calvin– Benson cycle. Three types of photosynthesis occur in plants, C3 <b>carbon</b> <b>fixation,</b> C4 <b>carbon</b> <b>fixation</b> and CAM photosynthesis. These differ by the route that carbon dioxide takes to the Calvin cycle, with C3 plants fixing CO2 directly, while C4 and CAM photosynthesis incorporate the CO2 into other compounds first, as adaptations to deal with intense sunlight and dry conditions.|$|E

40|$|Heterotrophic (dark, non-photosynthetic) <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>fixation</b> was {{measured}} in the phytoflagellate Euglena gracilis. Variation in heterotrophic <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>fixation</b> depends on the phase of batch growth and the mode of nutrition. A sharp increase in heterotrophic <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>fixation</b> occurs during the mid- to late-logarithmic growth periods in Euglena growing photoautotrophically (with carbon dioxide as carbon source, light as energy source) and heterotrophically (in the dark with glucose as sole carbon and energy source). Cells growing heterotrophically with acetate or ethanol as sole carbon source do not increase their heterotrophic <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>fixation</b> during the growth cycle. Addition of acetate to cultures of Euglena causes a reduction in dark <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>fixation.</b> The {{results are consistent with}} the hypothesis that heterotrophic <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>fixation</b> in Euglena functions in anaplerotic replenishment of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The regulation of these changes in heterotrophic <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>fixation</b> was shown to be controlled by exogenous ammonium in a complex fashion. Ammonium stimulates heterotrophic <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>fixation</b> after a period of ammonium deprivation. The kinetics of the regulatory effects of the ammonium ion on dark <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>fixation</b> are presented. A survey into the activities of carboxylating enzymes from both autotrophically and heterotrophically grown Euglena was conducted. The heterotrophic cultures were supplied with either glucose or acetate as substrate. PEP carboxykinase (E. C. 4. 1. 1. 38) and (E. C. 4. 1. 1. 49) could not be detected in any of the cultures tested. A trace amount of PEP carboxykinase (E. C. 4. 1. 1. 32) is present in the acetate grown cells only and a trace amount of pyruvate carboxylase (E. C. 6. 4. 1. 1.) is present in the glucose grown cells only. Malate enzyme (E. C. 1. 1. 1. 40), PEP carboxylase (E. C. 4. 1. 1. 31) and acetylcoenzyme A carboxylase (E. C. 6. 4. 1. 2) are present in all cells tested. Ammonium stimulation causes a small increase in specific activity of all the enzymes except acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The largest increase occurs in PEP carboxylase, but the increase is not sufficient to account for observed increases in whole cell dark <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>fixation</b> after ammonium stimulation. Two isoenzymes of PEP carboxylase were purified from each other from both ammonium stimulated and non-stimulated cells. There are no significant differences between elution profiles of isoenzymes from ammonium stimulated and control cells. There are no significant differences between elution profiles of isoenzymes from autotrophic and heterotrophic cells. The kinetics of the regulation of the two isoenzymes by malate, citrate, succinate and 3 -phosphoglycerate are presented. The products of heterotrophic <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>fixation</b> by ammonium stimulated and control cells were identified and measured by chromatography.

There, Slotin gained his first experience with nuclear chemistry, helping to build the first cyclotron in the midwestern United States. The job paid poorly and Slotin's father had to support him for two years. From 1939 to 1940, Slotin collaborated with Earl Evans, {{the head of the}} university's biochemistry department, to produce radiocarbon (carbon-14 and carbon-11) from the cyclotron.

5|$|Plants face severe {{challenges}} in arid environments. Problems {{they need to}} solve include how to obtain enough water, how to avoid being eaten and how to reproduce. Photosynthesis {{is the key to}} plant growth. It can only take place during the day as energy from the sun is required, but during the day, many deserts become very hot. Opening stomata to allow in the carbon dioxide necessary for the process causes evapotranspiration, and conservation of water is a top priority for desert vegetation. Some plants have resolved this problem by adopting crassulacean acid metabolism, allowing them to open their stomata during the night to allow CO2 to enter, and close them during the day, or by using C4 <b>carbon</b> <b>fixation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Remains {{attributed}} to Hypogeomys australis are known from Andrahomana in southeastern Madagascar and Antsirabe in central Madagascar, suggesting a broad former distribution. Its range {{is not known}} to overlap that of H.antimena, which has undergone a dramatic reduction during the Holocene. A bone from Andrahomana has been radiocarbon dated to about 4440 BP and another to 1536 BP. Although almost nothing is known of the ecology of H.australis, Goodman and Rakotondravony presumed that it was similar to its living relative in living in burrows in areas with loose soils. H.australis shows relatively high content of carbon-13 isotope, likely because it ate some plants which were enriched in carbon-13 through C4 <b>carbon</b> <b>fixation</b> and crassulacean acid metabolism; both of these photosynthesis-related processes occur most frequently in plants adapted to dry environments.|$|E

40|$|Spring ephemeral herbs inhabiting {{deciduous}} forests commonly complete {{reproduction and}} vegetative growth before canopy closure in early summer. Effects of shading by early canopy closure on reproductive output and vegetative growth, however, may {{vary depending on}} the seasonal allocation patterns of photosynthetic products between current reproduction and storage for future growth in each species. To clarify the effects of sink-source balance on seed production and bulb growth in a spring ephemeral herb, Gagea lutea, we performed a bract removal treatment (source reduction) and a floral-bud removal treatment (sink reduction) under canopy and open conditions. Leaf <b>carbon</b> <b>fixations</b> did not differ between the forest and open sites and among treatments. Bract <b>carbon</b> <b>fixations</b> were also similar between sites but tended to decrease when floral buds were removed. Seed production was higher under open condition but decreased by the bract-removal treatment under both light conditions. In contrast, bulb growth was independent of light conditions and the bract-removal treatment but increased greatly by the bud-removal treatment. Therefore, leaves and bracts acted as specialized source organs for vegetative and reproductive functions, respectively, but photosynthetic products by bracts were flexibly used for bulb growth when plants failed to set fruits. Extension of bright period was advantageous for seed production (i. e., source limited) but not for vegetative growth (i. e., sink limited) in this species...|$|R
5|$|Under {{terrestrial}} conditions, {{conversion of}} one element to another is very rare. Therefore, {{the amount of}} carbon on Earth is effectively constant. Thus, processes that use carbon must obtain it from somewhere and dispose of it somewhere else. The paths of carbon in the environment form the carbon cycle. For example, photosynthetic plants draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (or seawater) and build it into biomass, as in the Calvin cycle, a process of <b>carbon</b> <b>fixation.</b> Some of this biomass is eaten by animals, while some carbon is exhaled by animals as carbon dioxide. The carbon cycle is considerably more complicated than this short loop; for example, some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the oceans; if bacteria do not consume it, dead plant or animal matter may become petroleum or coal, which releases carbon when burned.|$|E
5|$|Some {{bacteria}} produce intracellular nutrient storage granules {{for later}} use, such as glycogen, polyphosphate, sulfur or polyhydroxyalkanoates. Certain bacterial species, {{such as the}} photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, produce internal gas vacuoles, vesicles which they use to regulate their buoyancy—allowing them to move up or down into water layers with different light intensities and nutrient levels. The gas vacuoles are freely permeable to gas. Intracellular membranes called chromatophores are also found in membranes of phototrophic bacteria. Used primarily for photosynthesis, they contain bacteriochlorophyll pigments and carotenoids. An early idea was that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes, but these were later shown to be artefacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy. Inclusions {{are considered to be}} nonliving components of the cell that do not possess metabolic activity and are not bounded by membranes. The most common inclusions are glycogen, lipid droplets, crystals, and pigments. Volutin granules are cytoplasmic inclusions of complexed inorganic polyphosphate. These granules are called metachromatic granules due to their displaying the metachromatic effect; they appear red or blue when stained with the blue dyes methylene blue or toluidine blue.Microcompartments are widespread, membrane-bound organelles that are made of a protein shell that surrounds and encloses various enzymes.

Autotrophic <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>fixation</b> is energetically expensive and it is therefore not surprising that in the various groups of autotrophic bacteria the operation of the cycle is under strict metabolic control. Synthesis of phosphoribulokinase and ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase, the two enzymes specifically involved in the Calvin cycle, is regulated via end-product repression. In this control phosphoenolpyruvate most likely has an alarmone function. Studies of the enzymes isolated from various sources have indicated that phosphoribulokinase is the target enzyme for the control of the rate of <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>fixation</b> via the Calvin cycle through modulation of existing enzyme activity. In general, this enzyme is strongly activated by NADH, whereas AMP and phosphoenolpyruvate are effective inhibitors.

Despite previous suggestions of a putative <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>fixation</b> pathway, no up-regulation of proteins typically associated with <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>fixation</b> was evident during incubation in the absence of organic carbon.
