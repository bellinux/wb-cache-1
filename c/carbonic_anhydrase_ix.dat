40|$|Background: <b>Carbonic</b> <b>anhydrase</b> <b>IX</b> is {{a member}} of α-carbonic anhydrases that is {{preferentially}} expressed in solid tumors. It enables bicarbonate transport across the plasma membrane, neutralizing intracellular pH and conferring to cancer cells a survival advantage in hypoxic/acidic microenvironments. Overexpression of <b>carbonic</b> <b>anhydrase</b> <b>IX</b> in cancer tissues is regulated by hypoxia inducible factor 1 α - mediated transcription and the enzyme is considered a marker of tumor hypoxia and poor outcome. The role of <b>carbonic</b> <b>anhydrase</b> <b>IX</b> in prostate cancer has not been fully clarified and controversy has arisen on whether this enzyme is overexpressed in hypoxic prostate cancer tissues. Methods: We analyzed the expression of <b>carbonic</b> <b>anhydrase</b> <b>IX</b> and hypoxia inducible factor 1 α in two prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and PC- 3, and in 110 cancer biopsies, by western blotting and immunocyto/histochemistry. Results: In LNCaP and PC- 3 cells, <b>carbonic</b> <b>anhydrase</b> <b>IX</b> was mostly cytoplasmic/nuclear, with very limited membrane localization. Nuclear staining became stronger under hypoxia. When we analyzed <b>carbonic</b> <b>anhydrase</b> <b>IX</b> expression in human prostate cancer biopsies, we found that protein staining positively correlated with hypoxia inducible factor 1 α and with Gleason pattern and score, {{as well as with the}} novel grading system proposed by the International Society of Urological Pathology for prostate cancer. Once more, <b>carbonic</b> <b>anhydrase</b> <b>IX</b> was mainly cytoplasmic in low grade carcinomas, whereas in high grade tumors was strongly expressed in the nucleus of the neoplastic cell. An association between <b>carbonic</b> <b>anhydrase</b> <b>IX</b> expression level and the main clinic-pathological features involved in prostate cancer aggressiveness was identified. Conclusions: There was a statistically significant association between <b>carbonic</b> <b>anhydrase</b> <b>IX</b> and hypoxia inducible factor 1 α in prostate cancer tissues, that identifies the enzyme as a reliable marker of tumor hypoxia. In addition, <b>carbonic</b> <b>anhydrase</b> <b>IX</b> expression positively correlated with prostate cancer grading and staging, and with outcome, suggesting that the protein may be an independent prognosticator for the disease. The nuclear translocation of the enzyme in hypoxic cancer cells may epitomize a biological switch of the tumor towards a less favorable phenotype...|$|E

Whereas the localization of carbonic anhydrases in the kidney has been long established, interest in carbonic anhydrases has increased dramatically for renal cancer, in particular for the clear cell variant of renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) because <b>carbonic</b> <b>anhydrase</b> <b>IX</b> is specifically expressed in ccRCC.

Archival tumour samples from 166 patients were analysed for CA IX expression by three different evaluations: positive/negative, proportion of positivity and staining intensity. The results of immunohistochemical analysis were confirmed by demonstrating CA IX protein in western blotting analysis. Forty-four percent of the operative samples were CA IX positive, of these 34 % had weak and 66 % moderate/strong staining intensity. In univariate survival analysis, intensity of CA IX expression was a predictor of DFS (P= 0. 003) and DSS (P= 0. 034), both being markedly longer in tumours with negative or weakly positive staining.

40|$|Hypoxia is a {{characteristic}} of many solid tumors and an adverse prognostic factor for treatment outcome. Hypoxia increases the expression of <b>carbonic</b> <b>anhydrase</b> <b>IX,</b> an enzyme that is predominantly found on tumor cells and is involved in maintaining the cellular pH balance. Many clinical studies investigated the prognostic value of <b>carbonic</b> <b>anhydrase</b> <b>IX</b> expression, but most have been inconclusive, partly due to small numbers of patients included. The present meta-analysis was therefore performed utilizing the results of all clinical studies to determine the prognostic value of <b>carbonic</b> <b>anhydrase</b> <b>IX</b> expression in solid tumors. Renal cell carcinoma was excluded from this meta-analysis due to an alternative mechanism of upregulation. 958 papers were identified from a literature search performed in Pubmed and Embase.

The meta-analysis revealed strong significant associations between CAIX expression and all endpoints: overall survival (HR= 1. 76, 95 %CI 1. 58 – 1. 98), disease-free survival (HR= 1. 87, 95 %CI 1. 62 – 2. 16), locoregional control (HR= 1. 54, 95 %CI 1. 22 – 1. 93), disease-specific survival (HR= 1. 78, 95 %CI 1. 41 – 2. 25), metastasis-free survival (HR= 1. 82, 95 %CI 1. 33 – 2. 50), and progression-free survival (HR= 1. 58, 95 %CI 1. 27 – 1. 96). Subgroup analyses revealed similar associations in the majority of tumor sites and types. In conclusion, these results show that patients having tumors with high <b>carbonic</b> <b>anhydrase</b> <b>IX</b> expression have higher risk of locoregional failure, disease progression, and higher risk to develop metastases, independent of tumor type or site.

40|$|Introduction The {{knowledge}} about the molecular biology of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is evolving, and <b>Carbonic</b> <b>Anhydrase</b> type <b>IX</b> (CA-IX) {{has emerged as a}} potential prognostic marker in this challenging disease. However, most of the literature about CA-IX on ccRCC comes from series on metastatic cancer, with a lack of series on non-metastatic cancer. The objective is to evaluate the expression of CA-IX in a cohort of non-metastatic ccRCC, correlating with 1) overall survival, and 2) with established prognostic parameters (T stage, tumor size, Fuhrman nuclear grade, microvascular invasion and peri-renal fat invasion). Materials and Methods This is a retrospective cohort study. We evaluated 95 patients with non-metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma, as to the expression of CA-IX. The analyzed parameters where: overall survival (OS), TNM stage, tumor size (TS), Fuhrman nuclear grade (FNG), microvascular invasion (MVI), peri-renal fat invasion (PFI). We utilized a custom built tissue microarray, and the immunoexpression was digitally quantified using the Photoshop&# 174; software. Results: Th e mean follow-up time was 7. 9 years (range 1. 9 to 19. 5 years). The analysis of CA-IX expression against the selected prognostic parameters showed no correlation. The results are as follows: Overall survival (p = 0. 790); T stage (p = 0. 179); tumor size (p = 0. 143); grouped Fuhrman nuclear grade (p = 0. 598); microvascular invasion (p = 0. 685), and peri-renal fat invasion (p = 0. 104).

In the present study, we found that Car 9 mRNA and CA IX were expressed in proliferating but not hypertrophic chondrocytes. of Car 9 siRNA to mouse primary chondrocytes obtained from costal cartilage induced the mRNA expressions of Col 10 a 1, the gene for type X collagen a- 1 chain, and Epas 1, the gene for hypoxia-responsible factor- 2 a (HIF- 2 a), both of which are known to be characteristically expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes. On the other hand, forced expression of CA IX had no effect of the proliferation of chondrocytes or the transcription of Col 10 a 1 and Epas 1, while the transcription of Col 2 a 1 and Aca...|$|R
40|$|During severe hypoxia (< 0. 01 % oxygen) {{the protein}} folding {{machinery}} becomes dysfunctional, {{resulting in the}} accumulation of unfolded proteins with consequent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, a process involved in the physiological turnover of cytoplasmic components. The link between the UPR and autophagy is not clearly defined. The aim of this thesis is to investigate {{the role of the}} induction of UPR under severe hypoxia in tumour survival and resistance to therapy. The results of this research suggest that the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF 4), a component of the PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway, fundamental in the UPR, is required for the ER-stress induced upregulation of autophagy. Mechanisms other than hypoxia for UPR induction were investigated, using the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BZ). BZ treatment increased ATF 4 protein levels in MCF 7 cells, even transfected with short-interference RNA (siRNA) against the classical UPR activator PERK, suggesting that the proteasomal stabilization is likely the main mechanism for ATF 4 protein accumulation. The induction of autophagy by BZ is dependent upon the upregulation of the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 B (LC 3 B), an autophagy marker, by ATF 4 and acts as a survival mechanism. Hypoxia, UPR and autophagy markers (such as Pimonidazole, <b>carbonic</b> <b>anhydrases</b> <b>IX</b> (CAIX), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and LC 3 B) were evaluated by immunohistochemical approach in spheroids, xenografts models and breast cancer samples. CHOP immunohistochemical staining was performed in breast cancer sections from a series of patients. CHOP was expressed in cells surrounding necrotic areas. No correlation were found with clinical outcome and further studies are needed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
