40|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{utility of}} Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA detection in cerebrospinal fluid for {{the diagnosis of}} <b>central</b> nervous <b>system</b> lymphoma was evaluated with two different PCR assays to test a collection of cerebrospinal fluid samples from 24 AIDS patients with <b>central</b> nervous <b>system</b> disorders. A PCR assay amplifying a fragment from the BamHI-W region had the highest clinical and analytic sensitivity. The BamHI-W PCR assay detected EBV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid from 83 % (5 of 6) of patients with pathologically proven primary <b>central</b> nervous <b>system</b> lymphoma and 7 % (1 of 16) of controls with autopsy-proven nonlymphomatous <b>central</b> nervous <b>system</b> disorders. EBV DNA was also detected in one patient with autopsy-proven systemic lymphoma involving the <b>central</b> nervous <b>system</b> and one patient with probable primary <b>central</b> nervous <b>system</b> lymphoma. EBV DNA was detected consistently when <b>central</b> nervous <b>system</b> lymphoma involved meningeal surfaces. PCR for EBV in cerebrospinal fluid appears to be useful for diagnosis of AIDS-related <b>central</b> nervous <b>system</b> lymphoma, but additional studies are required to better define {{the sensitivity of the}} assay and to understand the significance of a positive test in the absence of lymphoma...|$|R
25|$|The {{impacts of}} trust and {{availability}} on performance and development difficulty can influence the choice of whether to deploy onto a dedicated cluster, to idle machines internal to the developing organization, or to an open external network of volunteers or contractors. In many cases, the participating nodes must trust the <b>central</b> <b>system</b> not to abuse the access that is being granted, by interfering with the operation of other programs, mangling stored information, transmitting private data, or creating new security holes.

Ethnic entrepreneurs were able to take control of the institutionally allocated resources to wage war on other ethnic groups.|$|E
40|$|Congenital <b>central</b> nervous <b>system</b> (CNS) {{tumors are}} {{a rare and}} diverse group of tumors with {{variable}} biological behav-ior depending on location and histology.

Congenital <b>central</b> nervous <b>system</b> tumors have been vari-ously defined as (1) definitely congenital (present at birth); (2) probably congenital (arising within {{the first week of}} life); and, (3) possibly congenital (arising within the first month of life). 1 Congenital <b>central</b> nervous <b>system</b> tumors are generally categorized separately from <b>central</b> nervous <b>system</b> tumors associated with familial or genetic syn-dromes and are biologically distinct from those arising in childhood.

40|$|The <b>central</b> nervous <b>system</b> (CNS) {{was once}} {{considered}} to be an immune-privileged area. However, increasing evidence shows that the <b>central</b> nervous <b>system</b> is not an immune-privileged but is an active surveillance site. There is a bi-directional communication between the <b>central</b> nervous <b>system</b> and immune system. Normally, immune cells migrate into the <b>central</b> nervous <b>system</b> microenvironment through choroid plexus and interact with the <b>central</b> nervous <b>system</b> resident cells through either through neuromediators or immunomediators.

50|$|The only scientifically proven and biologically {{possible}} way to guarantee instant incapacitation is through {{destruction of the}} <b>central</b> nervous <b>system</b> or brain. This will usually cease all motor-related and voluntary actions. If the <b>central</b> nervous <b>system</b> is not damaged or destroyed, {{there will be no}} immediate incapacitation. To allow room for error, since a <b>central</b> nervous <b>system</b> hit is very unlikely, most people use expanding ammunition. This will increase the odds of striking a part of the <b>central</b> nervous <b>system,</b> and cause faster blood loss.|$|R

25|$|The line {{became part}} of the Penn <b>Central</b> <b>system</b> in 1969; the section in Massachusetts was {{purchased}} by the state in 1973, while Amtrak acquired the Rhode Island section in 1976. The line was electrified in 2000; it is now part of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, used by high-speed Acela Express service, intercity Northeast Regional service, and MBTA Commuter Rail Providence/Stoughton Line local service. The rapid transit MBTA Orange Line shares the right-of-way for several miles in the 1987-built Southwest Corridor section in Boston. The Stoughton Branch is also used for Providence/Stoughton Line service, and the northern section of the Dedham Branch is used by the Needham Line.|$|E
25|$|Water {{and steam}} based central heating systems have {{traditionally}} had overall control by wall-mounted bi-metallic strip thermostats. These sense the air temperature using the differential expansion of two metals to actuate an on/off switch. Typically the <b>central</b> <b>system</b> would be switched {{on when the}} temperature drops below the set point on the thermostat, and switched off when it rises above, with a few degrees of hysteresis to prevent excessive switching. Bi-metallic sensing is now being superseded by electronic sensors. A principal use of the bi-metallic thermostat today is in individual electric convection heaters, where control is on/off, based on the local air temperature and the set point desired by the user. These are also used on air-conditioners, where local control is required.|$|E

25|$|In 1968 the NYC {{merged with}} its former rival, the Pennsylvania Railroad, to form Penn Central (the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad joined in 1969). That company went {{bankrupt}} in 1970 {{and was taken}} over by the federal government and merged into Conrail in 1976. Conrail was broken up in 1998, and portions of its system was transferred to the newly formed New York Central Lines LLC, a subsidiary leased to and eventually absorbed by CSX and Norfolk Southern. Those companies' lines included the original New York Central main line, but outside that area it included lines that were never part of the New York <b>Central</b> <b>system.</b> CSX was able to take {{one of the most important}} main lines in the nation, which runs from New York City and Boston to Cleveland, Ohio, as part of the Water Level Route, while Norfolk Southern gained the Cleveland, Ohio to Chicago, Illinois portion of the line called the Chicago line.|$|E
500|$|By 22:15, Lützow had shipped nearly 2,400tons of water, and {{the ship}} was dangerously down by the bows. After midnight, {{attempts}} were made to steer the ship in reverse. This failed when the bow became submerged enough to bring the stern out of the water; by 02:20, the screws and both rudders were coming out of the water {{and the ship}} was no longer able to steer. The order to abandon ship was given, and at 02:47, Lützow was sunk by the torpedo boat [...] The ship was lost because the flooding in the bow could not be controlled; the forward pump system failed and the <b>central</b> <b>system</b> could not keep up with the rising water. The crew was picked up by four torpedo boats that had been escorting the crippled battlecruiser; during the battle the ship suffered 116 men killed.|$|E
500|$|In April 2006 Yeovil {{became the}} first town in Britain to {{institute}} a somewhat controversial system of biometric fingerprint scanning in nightclubs. Individuals wishing {{to gain access to}} one of the town's nightclubs were asked in the first instance to submit their personal details for inclusion in a <b>central</b> <b>system.</b> This included a photograph and index fingerprint. Thereafter, each entry to one of the participating premises required a fingerprint scan. The scheme is no longer in operation. According to Nigel J Marston, Licensing Manager of South Somerset District Council, the scheme was short lived as, [...] "The company that originally supplied went through various changes of ownership and the project became unsupported. This allied to several of the venues closing down lead to the death of the scheme." [...] In February 2007, Yeovil Town Council {{became the first}} English council to ban the children's craze Heelys in the centre of the town and High Street. Skateboards, roller skates and roller blades are also illegal in the area. Councilors have stated this is due to [...] "numerous complaints about the activities of youngsters".|$|E
