5|$|An {{electron}} generates {{an electric}} field that exerts an attractive force on a particle {{with a positive}} charge, such as the proton, and a repulsive force on a particle with a negative charge. The strength of this force in nonrelativistic approximation is determined by Coulomb's inverse square law. When an electron is in motion, it generates a magnetic field. The Ampère-Maxwell law relates the magnetic field to the mass motion of electrons (the current) with respect to an observer. This property of induction supplies the magnetic field that drives an electric motor. The electromagnetic field of an arbitrary moving charged particle is expressed by the Liénard–Wiechert potentials, which are valid even when the particle's speed is <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of light (relativistic).|$|E

He then requests permission for a further detour to re-join his family on Horizon as his father is ill and he hasn't been able to visit him in four years. Captain Archer readily agrees, but bad news arrives when Mayweather learns that his father died some six weeks earlier.|$|E

5|$|Berzelius {{made some}} initial characterisations {{of the new}} metal and its {{chemical}} compounds: he correctly determined that the thorium–oxygen mass ratio of thorium oxide was 7.5 (its actual value is <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> ~7.3), but he assumed the new element was divalent rather than tetravalent, and so calculated that the atomic mass was 7.5 times that of oxygen (120 amu); it is actually 15 times as large. He determined that thorium was a very electropositive metal, ahead of cerium and behind zirconium in electropositivity. Metallic thorium was isolated {{for the first time}} in 1914 by Dutch entrepreneurs Dirk Lely Jr. and Lodewijk Hamburger.|$|E
5|$|Bethe {{managed to}} work it out on the train from New York to Schenectady. He arrived at a value of 1040MHz, {{extremely}} <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> obtained experimentally by Lamb and Retherford. He did so by realising that it was a non-relativistic process, which greatly simplified the calculations. His paper, published in the Physical Review in August 1947 was only two pages long and contained just 12 mathematical equations, but was enormously influential. Hitherto, it had been assumed that the infinities meant that QED was fundamentally flawed, and that a new, radical theory was required. Bethe demonstrated that this was not necessary.|$|E
5|$|Djedkare {{seems to}} have been held in high esteem during the Sixth Dynasty. For example, Merenre Nemtyemsaf I chose to place his pyramid complex <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of Djedkare. In addition, the South Saqqara Stone, a royal annal dating to the reign of Merenre or of his {{successor}} Pepi II, records rich offerings being made to Djedkare on behalf of the king. An estimated 92% of the text inscribed on the stone was lost when it was roughly polished to be reused as a sarcophagus lid, possibly in the late First Intermediate (c. 2160–2055 BC) to early Middle Kingdom period (c. 2055–1650 BC).|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{stabilization}} of its outer 8s electrons, unbinilium's first ionization energy—the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom—is predicted to be 6.0eV, {{comparable to that}} of calcium. The electron of the hydrogen-like unbinilium atom—oxidized so it has only one electron, Ubn119+—is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 2.05 times that of a non-moving electron, a feature coming from the relativistic effects. For comparison, the figure for hydrogen-like radium is 1.30 and the figure for hydrogen-like barium is 1.095. According to simple extrapolations of relativity laws, that indirectly indicates the contraction of the atomic radius to around 200pm, very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of strontium (215pm); the ionic radius of the Ubn2+ ion is also correspondingly lowered to 160pm. The trend in electron affinity is also expected to reverse direction similarly at radium and unbinilium.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies grow on the ground. Phellodon species, {{like all}} members of the order Thelephorales, are thought to be mycorrhizal, forming {{symbiotic}} relationships with trees. Usual hosts include species from the families Fagaceae (beeches and oaks) and Pinaceae. The ectomycorrhizae that P.niger forms with Norway spruce (Picea abies) has been comprehensively described. It is distinguished from the ectomycorrhizae of other Thelephorales species by the unique shape of its chlamydospores. Stable isotope ratio analysis of the abundance of the stable isotope carbon-13 shows that P.niger has a metabolic signature <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of saprotrophic fungi, indicating that it may be able to obtain carbon from sources other than a tree host.|$|E
5|$|If {{you read}} {{the records of the}} Royal Society and what they were doing in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and I think Hooke was one of them– became a little bit disgusted with {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> but I think after a while, they got a little bit sick of it and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E

5|$|On September 29, 1944, Zinn {{received}} an urgent call from Samuel Allison, {{the director of}} the Metallurgical Laboratory. The B Reactor at Hanford had shut down shortly after reaching full power, only to come back to life again some hours later. Norman Hilberry suspected a neutron poison was responsible. If so, it had a half life of around 9.7 hours. Xenon-135 had a half life <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> but had not been detected in Argonne or by the X-10 Graphite Reactor in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Zinn quickly brought Chicago Pile-3 up to full power, and within twelve hours, had made a series of measurements that confirmed the Hanford results.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide fibers {{are used}} to measure gas {{temperatures}} in an optical technique called thin filament pyrometry. It involves the placement of a thin filament in a hot gas stream. Radiative emissions from the filament can be correlated with filament temperature. Filaments are SiC fibers with a diameter of 15 micrometers, about one fifth that of a human hair. Because the fibers are so thin, they do little to disturb the flame and their temperature remains <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of the local gas. Temperatures of about 800–2500 K can be measured.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{became aware}} of their losses to night fighters, and began a rush program to {{introduce}} a new radar operating on different frequencies. This led to the lower-VHF band FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2, which began to reach operational units in small numbers between August and October 1943, with about 50 units in use by November. In February 1944, No. 80 Sqn noticed a marked decrease in FuG 202 transmissions. By this time the Germans had produced 200 SN-2 sets, and this had reached 1,000 by May. This set deliberately selected a frequency <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of their ground-based Freya radar sets, {{in the hopes that}} these sources would swamp any wide-band receiver set used on RAF aircraft. Early Serrate units were effectively useless by June 1944, and their replacements were never as successful.|$|E
5|$|The Jags {{flirted with}} a number of colour schemes in their early years. From their {{inception}} until 1900 the kits were predominantly blue with red and white trimmings. There was then a brief period in which the players wore an orange and black striped top with white shorts and black socks. This was replaced in 1905 by a colour scheme <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> used by Aston Villa, before the club reverted to the predominantly blue kits in 1909. In season 1936–37 they changed to, and settled upon, the red-yellow-and-black attire for which they are best known, this change having been triggered initially by the club borrowing kits from the local rugby union team, West of Scotland Football Club.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} of the hydrogen-like ununennium atom—oxidized so it {{has only}} one electron, Uue118+—is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 1.99 times that of a non-moving electron, a feature coming from the relativistic effects. For comparison, the figure for hydrogen-like francium is 1.29 and the figure for hydrogen-like caesium is 1.091. According to simple extrapolations of relativity laws, that indirectly indicates the contraction of the atomic radius to around 240pm, very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of rubidium (247pm); the metallic radius is also correspondingly lowered to 260pm.

Macroscopic amounts of curium(III) fluoride were obtained in 1950 by W. W. T. Crane, J. C. Wallmann and B. B. Cunningham. Its magnetic susceptibility was very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of GdF3 providing the first experimental evidence for the +3 valence of curium in its compounds.

The Rauma Line was not built beyond Åndalsnes, and in 1935 the Parliament of Norway decided to connect the coastal towns in Møre og Romsdal to Åndalsnes by road instead of rail.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbers of}} women with SCI giving birth and having healthy babies are increasing. Around a half to two-thirds of women with SCI report {{they might want to}} have children, and 14–20% do get {{pregnant}} at least once. Although female fertility is not usually permanently reduced by SCI, there is a stress response that can happen immediately post-injury that alters levels of fertility-related hormones in the body. In about half of women, menstruation stops after the injury but then returns within an average of five months—it returns within a year for a large majority.
