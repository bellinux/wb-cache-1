40|$|Detection of bone {{fragments}} and other physical contaminations in deboned poultry meat {{has become increasingly}} important to ensure food quality and safety. Traditional X-ray imaging detection technologies have significant difficulties detecting contaminations because of the meat tissue thickness variation. In order to address the thickness variation problem, in this study, a novel vision system with combined X-ray and laser 3 D imaging technology has been developed for accurate physical contamination detection. The X-ray part of the combined system captures high resolution X-ray images in real-time, and the laser 3 D part provides an accurate thickness profile for each piece of meat. In the combined system, the 3 D thickness information is used to cancel the thickness variation in the X-ray image, thus the process of physical contamination detection is significantly simplified. The combined vision system is capable of detecting <b>calcified</b> <b>bones</b> (rib bones and pulley bones) at a 95 % detection rate, and partially <b>calcified</b> <b>bones</b> (fan bones) at a 90 % detection rate. In order to handle the inspection tasks in real-time, a multithread architecture is used in this vision system. Various threads work simultaneously in the system, synchronized with each other, taking full advantage of system resources. It is shown that real-time capability is achieved due to the multithread framework.

40|$|AbstractBackground contextReconstruction of {{acetabular}} defect {{has been}} advocated as standard procedure in total hip arthroplasty. The presence of bony defects at the acetabulum {{is viewed as}} a cause of instability and acetabular wall augmentation is often used without proper consideration of surrounding bone density. The initial cup-bone stability is, however, a challenge and a number of studies supported by clinical follow-ups of patients suggested that if the structural graft needs supporting more than 50 % of the acetabular component, a reconstruction cage device spanning ilium to ischium should be preferred to protect the graft and provide structural stability. This study aims to (1) investigate the relationship between cup motion and bone density and (2) quantify the re-distribution of stress at the defect site after augmentation. HyphotesisPaprosky type I or II, acetabular defects, when reconstructed with bone screws supported by bioabsorbable <b>calcified</b> triglyceride <b>bone</b> cement are significantly less effective for osteoporotic bone than healthy bone. Materials and methodsAcetabular wall defects were reconstructed on six cadaveric subjects with bioabsorbable <b>calcified</b> triglyceride <b>bone</b> cement using a re-bar technique. Data of the specimen with higher bone density was used to validate a Finite Element Model. Values of bone apparent density ranging from healthy to osteoporotic were simulated to evaluate (1) the cup motion, through both displacement and rotation, (2) and the von Mises stress distribution. ResultsDefect reconstruction with bone screws and bioabsorbable <b>calcified</b> triglyceride <b>bone</b> cement results in a re-distribution of stress at the defect site. For a reduction of 65 % in bone density, the cup displacement was similar to a healthy bone for loads not exceeding 300 N, as load progressed up to 1500 N, the reconstructed defect showed increase of 99 μm (128 %) in displacement and of 0. 08 ° in rotation angle. ConclusionsBased on the results, we suggest that an alternative solution to wall defect augmentation with bone screws supported by bioabsorbable <b>calcified</b> triglyceride <b>bone</b> cement, be used for osteoporotic bone.

40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} a possible mechanism {{to explain the}} presence of aluminium lines within fully <b>calcified</b> <b>bone</b> in aluminium-related osteomalacia. METHODS: Fifty five bone cases shown by bone biopsy to be aluminium-related osteomalacia were studied. In 38 specimens aluminium lines were identified within <b>calcified</b> <b>bone</b> {{by means of the}} Aluminon stain and a characteristic form of patchy mineralisation was seen within thickened osteoid seams. Five representative examples were analysed quantitatively by histomorphometry and electronprobe X-ray microanalysis and compared with five cases of vitamin D deficiency-related osteomalacia which also had patchy mineralisation. RESULTS: The patchy calcification occupied 40 +/- 8 % (mean +/- SEM) of the osteoid and consisted of small focal deposits (less than 40 microns diameter), often (52 %) around osteoid osteocytes (probably an underestimate of the association), and larger areas that extended to the aluminium lines at the underlying mineralisation front. Small and large mineralisation nuclei were seen ultrastructurally in the patchy calcification. Quantitative electronprobe X-ray microanalysis showed that calcium concentrations and calcium:phosphorus ratios in the mineralisation nuclei and in the superficial layer of the fully <b>calcified</b> <b>bone</b> of the aluminium-related osteomalacia cases were significantly less than values measured at similar sites in the vitamin D deficiency-related osteomalacia cases. Furthermore, aluminium could not be detected by means of this technique at the mineralisation front or along cement lines in these specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Calcification can occur in thickened osteoid seams in osteomalacia. It can begin around osteoid osteocytes as small deposits that enlarge within the osteoid and extend to the underlying mineralisation front or cement line where aluminium lines may become trapped. Complete calcification of osteoid could account for the presence of aluminium lines within fully <b>calcified</b> <b>bone.</b> The Aluminon stain appears to be a more sensitive method for the detection of aluminium in bone than electronprobe X-ray microanalysis...|$|E

The study found the cancellous network of the patella to be markedly different from other regions of the knee. The bone volume of the patella is significantly higher and fails to show a decrease with age. A correlation exists between subchondral bone and both the volume and the trabecular thickness of the adjacent cancellous network. A correlation between calcified cartilage thickness and the bone volume and the trabecular thickness of the adjacent cancellous network exists only in the patella.

In mammals and the chick PTHrP is a hypercalcaemic factor causing lysis of <b>bone</b> <b>calcified</b> matrix and inhibiting phosphate excretion via the kidney. Functions of PTHrP in fishes are unknown but SL stimulates phosphate re-absorption by flounder kidney tubule cells 1 and low ambient calcium activates PI cells of trout pituitaries. 2 It appears possible that both peptides have some similar functions. They only share incidental amino acid homologies, so we have examined brain and pituitaries of sea bream for their distribution using specific antiserum to chum salmon SL (generous gift of H. Kawauchi) and to two regions of human PTHrP (1 – 16) and (50 – 69) ...|$|R
40|$|Like many elements, {{fluoride}} {{is beneficial}} {{to human health}} in small doses but can be toxic in excess. The links between low intakes of fluoride and dental protection are well known, however, fluoride is a powerful calcium-seeking element and can interfere with the <b>calcified</b> structure of <b>bones</b> and teeth {{in the human body}} at higher concentration causing dental or skeletal fluorosis. One of the main exposure routes is via drinking water and the World Health Organisation currently set the following water quality health criteria: 1. 5 mg/lF dental fluorosis may occur and > 3 - 5 mg/lF skeletal fluorosis may occur. In Central Europe, groundwater resources that exceed the guideline value of 1. 5 mg/l are widespread and health effects associated with high fluoride in water have been reported...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) in the equine joint. Methods Equine articular cartilage was obtained from normal (N= 8) and osteochondrotic (OCD) (N= 6) femoropatellar joints from horses at necropsy. The activity of gelatinase MMPs was determined in sections of cartilage by in situ gelatin zymography. Results Gelatinase activity was markedly increased in articular cartilage obtained from OCD samples and was particularly prominent in the deep cartilage zone. Activity was only seen in the pericellular area of chondrocytes. In addition, in OCD cartilage there were vertical lines of activity, starting from the deep zone and radiating towards the articular surface. In contrast, normal cartilage showed {{only a very small}} amount of gelatinolytic activity, which was not restricted to specific cartilage zones. Gelatin zymography of culture supernatants from isolated chondrocytes demonstrated increased production of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 from OCD chondrocytes. Conclusions Sections of articular cartilage from OCD lesions revealed MMP activity, especially in the deep zone adjacent to the <b>calcified</b> subchondral <b>bone.</b> This MMP activity could account for the loss of cartilage integrity in the deep cartilage zone and the vertical lines of activity could represent areas of mechanical weakness, likely to result in fissures and the release of cartilage fragments into the joint space.
