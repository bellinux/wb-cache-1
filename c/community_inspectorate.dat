Former language and ideological divisions are {{not as important as}} they used to be but each com-munity still develops its own policies. The Flemish legislature immediately changed the laws affecting universities and colleges, whereas the French-speaking community changed some of the old Belgian laws incrementally. Both communities have retained the binary system and both have reorgan-ized colleges into smaller groups to improve educational delivery. Attempts to bring universities and colleges closer have been made, although each still has different missions and structures. Nevertheless, in both communities scope for individual policy-making by universities and colleges has increased, although it is legislatures which determine guidelines for staff policy. In the Flemish community, the legislature has imposed a system of quality assurance for teaching and research for each university and college. Although colleges are supposed to undertake research as well as teach, this is not yet common practice. Colleges traditionally have been more interested in teaching students and staff still have to teach more than at universities. This makes it unlikely that research will play an important role in most colleges in the future, although interest is growing. At the moment, colleges are busy adapting to new management systems and new freedoms which they have recently been given. Because of cutbacks in public spending and increases in student numbers, the unit of resource in universities and colleges is being squeezed. They have to provide more teaching and research with less resources. Universities are trying to expand their research capacities relying on external research money, with academic staff competing for research money both nationally and internationally, using private and public sources. This new money is providing universities with the opportun-ity to increase their junior staff but not senior staff levels. Since senior academic staff at universities have permanent contracts, there is little flexibility in managing human resources. On the other hand, with an ageing population, there will be many retirements in the next few years which will offer new job opportunities to younger academics. Proposals for premature early retirements have been discussed recently and, though not acted upon generally, some universities have encouraged those over 60, and in Flemish colleges those over 55, to retire early with full pensions. New quality assurance systems have been introduced in public and private Flemish colleges. French-speaking universities are not legally obliged to have quality assurance systems but many do. Quality assessment in French-speaking colleges is the responsibility of the <b>community</b> <b>inspectorate.</b> While quality management existed previously in Flandérs, national policy has changed the system. Each institution now has to report annually about actions taken and measures used to improve quality. National comparative quality assurance forces institutions to pay attention to what is happening in other institutions. Reports are published and, where necessary, institutions are expected to plan improvements. Up until now, no national reports have been available about the effects of quality assurance. Published reports only focus on assessing teaching in departments and faculties at a particular time. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that this policy has led to improved teaching performance, even though there are some signs of evaluation fatigue. On the other hand, others argue that quality management interferes with academic freedom and distracts academics from their real work, namely teaching and research. Nevertheless, academics in general have accepted that they must show that the public monies they use are properly accounted for. They have therefore been willing to accept reductions in their professional independence and autonomy, as a result of recent educational and managerial reforms. Although the academic profession has lost some of its professional auto-nomy and independence, it is still one where more candidates present themselves than there are vacancies. Many young researchers still consider the academic profession as offering more opportunities to conduct inde-pendent research than others do. Nevertheless, in some disciplines, such as medicine, engineering and economics, academic life has to compete with more rewarding career opportunities. The academic profession still enjoys high social standing, as providers of knowledge for policy making, the economy, the arts and industry. One indicator may be found in the growing amount of contract research commissioned by foundations and industry. On the other hand, the current organization of universities and colleges puts much more pressure on the academic profession than before. Higher education institutions are organizations having to compete with other similar organizations, such as non-university research units, both nationally and internationally. Teaching and research effectiveness have become more important than ever and higher education institutions need to know where they stand in the competition. While academics were previously semi-independent, scholarly entrepreneurs, they now have to perform within the structuren of departments, faculties and universities. This means that they are subject to more managerial control and more accountability, and this requires them to be members of teams and/or leaders of teams rather than independent researchers. Finally, the academic profession as a pre-dominantly male profession is gradually changing. Growing numbers of female undergraduates and junior staff are clear indicators that higher education institutions and the academic profession are becoming more feminized. status: publishe...|$|E
