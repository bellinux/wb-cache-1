50|$|Most {{trailers}} are towed {{by joining}} {{a ball and}} a <b>coupler</b> (<b>socket).</b> The coupler {{is attached to the}} trailer, and the ball hitch is attached to the tow vehicle. The coupler slides over the ball hitch. Then, pressure is applied to a clamp, usually with a toggle or lever, which secures theball in the coupler. To ensure that the appropriate amount of pressure is applied, the coupler is equipped with a locknut that allows the operator to adjust the tension. When properly attached, the coupler will have limited movement, swiveling mainly right and left as well as tilting slightly.|$|E
50|$|The {{pivot ball}} hitch is an anti-binding {{motorcycle}} trailer hitch assembly {{composed of a}} base and a trailer ball. The base is secured to a standard ball mount on the motorcycle. The trailer {{is attached to a}} <b>socket</b> <b>coupler.</b> A space between the ball shank and the assembly mount allow the ball to move left and right in a vertical plane. Thus, the ball remains in a generally upright position when the motorcycle leans left or right into a turn because the base of the pivot ball hitch is able to move in the opposite direction of the motorcycle without causing the coupler to bind.|$|R
