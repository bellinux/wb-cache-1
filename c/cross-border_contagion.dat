We use a multinomial logit model to estimate the number of banks in a given country that experience a large shock on the same day (?coexceedances?) as a function of variables measuring common shocks and coexceedances in other countries. Large shocks are measured by the bottom 95 th percentile of the distribution of the first difference in the daily distance to default of the bank. We find evidence in favour of significant <b>cross-border</b> <b>contagion.</b> We also find some evidence that since the introduction of the euro <b>cross-border</b> <b>contagion</b> may have increased.

40|$|I {{analyze the}} optimal design of banking {{supervision}} {{in the presence}} of cross-border lending. Cross-border lending could imply that an individual bank failure in one country could trigger negative spillover effects in another country. Such <b>cross-border</b> <b>contagion</b> effects {{could turn out to be}} important in the EU because national banking problems could easily spread via the highly integrated interbank market. I show that if benevolent supervisors are accountable only to their own jurisdiction, they will not take <b>cross-border</b> <b>contagion</b> effects into account. Supervisors with such a national mandate fail to implement the optimum from a supranational perspective. In consequence, the probability of a bank failure will be inefficiently high. Against the background of this result, I argue in favor of institutionalizing an EU ”Supervisory Coordination Authority” to which national supervisors are accountable. banking supervision, systemic risk, <b>cross-border</b> <b>contagion...</b>|$|E

A combined use of these indicators would provide information on different dimensions of integration and thus give regulators a more balanced picture of the general trend of equity market integration in the region. Our empirical results broadly show that a lot of progress has been witnessed between 1994 and 2001 in achieving greater integration among the Asian equity markets. However, the extent of financial integration remains weak and the integration process appears to have stalled since 2002.

40|$|Preliminary and incomplete. Comments welcome. Using {{data for}} European banks, 1991 - 2003, we {{estimate}} {{the probability of}} a bank experiencing a large shock in its default risk as a function of bank characteristics (idiosyncratic shocks), common macro shocks, and whether other banks also experienced a large shock in the same time period (contagion). We find evidence that contagion may be significant both domestically and across borders. Our results suggest that the probability of contagion is increasing in the number of banks simultaneously experiencing a tail event, while even a single bank could be significantly contagious. We also identify country-pairs where contagion may be significant. Contagion appears to be typically generated by particularly concentrated interbank exposures. In addition, we find evidence that the smallest banks in our sample are not able to cause <b>cross-border</b> <b>contagion,</b> while they tend to be contagious within their own countries. Also, smaller banks are found less likely to suffer from <b>cross-border</b> <b>contagion.</b> Lastly, asset quality shocks seem to be the most likely candidates to cause an idiosyncratic negative shock in banks ’ default risk, while shocks affecting the position of the yield-curve are apparently the most significant sources of common macro-level disturbances...|$|E

This article focuses on such interlinkages within Europe and potential contagion channeled through these interlinkages. It discusses the increased role of external financing {{as a source of}} funding for credit growth before the turmoil; analyzes potential channels of contagion through financial linkages; and assesses the magnitude of cross-border exposures between emerging and advanced European economies. Based on the stylized facts on these exposures, the article provides indices of exposure to regional contagion that could help identify the likely pressure points and capture potential spillover effects and propagation channels of a regional shock originating from a given country. financial linkages, <b>contagion,</b> <b>cross-border</b> flows, spillover effects, credit growth, Central Eastern Southeastern Europe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} contagion in {{a sample}} of European banks during 1996 - 2003. We use a multinomial logit model to estimate the number of banks in a given country that experience a large shock during the same period (“coexceedances”) as a function of variables measuring common shocks and lagged coexceedances in other countries. Large shocks are measured by the bottom 95 th percentile of the distribution of the first difference in the distance to default of the bank. Common shocks are modelled by extracting common factors from coexceedances, industry sector shocks and standard macro variables. We find significant <b>cross-border</b> <b>contagion</b> in the EU, but also some countries that seem to be completely insulated from contagion. We attribute this insulation to their very low cross-border interbank exposures. We also find some evidence that since the introduction of the euro <b>cross-border</b> <b>contagion</b> has increased and that contagion seems to spread largely through the interbank market. We report some evidence that only large banks are contagious across borders and also only large banks suffer from contagion across borders, which is in line with a tiered interbank market structure...|$|E

It analyzes a sample of sixteen largest listed Nordic banks from January 2004 to January 2014. Using a multinomial logit model we test whether there is any degree of contagion among the four banking sectors, whether it is more pro- nounced for larger banks and whether the recent financial crisis has exacerbated it. Our results {{are in line with}} similar studies conducted for other countries. In particular, we find that a shock in one bank- ing sector is positively associated with an increase in shocks in another banking sector. Second, these shocks are larger and more significant for larger and more active international banks. Finally, the effect of the recent financial crisis has ambiguous effects on the cross-sectoral banking contagion. It appears that contagious links between some sec- tors weakened (Sweden and Denmark, Sweden and Finland). Other economies (Sweden and Norway) on the contrary became more depen- dent on each other.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{implications}} of cross-border financial integration for financial stability when banks' loan portfolios adjust endogenously. Banks can be subject to sectoral and aggregate domestic shocks. After integration they can share these risks in a complete interbank market. When banks have a comparative advantage in providing credit to certain industries, financial integration may induce banks to specialize in lending. An enhanced concentration in lending does not necessarily increase risk, because a well-functioning interbank market allows to achieve the necessary diversification. This greater need for risk sharing, though, {{increases the risk of}} <b>cross-border</b> <b>contagion</b> and the likelihood of widespread banking crises. However, even though integration increases the risk of contagion it improves welfare if it permits banks to realize specialization benefits. JEL Classification: D 61, E 44, G 21.

40|$|While, undoubtedly, {{there are}} some {{development}} challenges {{that need to be}} tackled globally, it must be recognized that many Financing for Development issues are more effectively dealt with at the regional level. An example of this is the provision of public goods and services needed for development that are not provided by the market or by national governments in the absence of external assistance—regional health programs to contain endemic diseases, coordination of transport infrastructure among neighboring countries, regional energy cooperation, and financial regulation to limit <b>cross-border</b> <b>contagion,</b> to name but some of the challenges in point. The Regional Development Banks (RDBs) have a central role to play in the provision of these “regional public goods ” (RPGs). However, this role, the mechanisms and constraints under which it operates, its relationship to country-focussed assistance, and the challenge of financing RPGs, have not received much attention in the past. 2 This paper attempts to fill the gap by examining these issues {{in the context of the}} broader on-going debate about cross-border public goods in international assistance.

40|$|Integrated {{financial}} markets {{provide opportunities for}} expansion and improved risk sharing, but also pose threats of contagion risk through cross-border exposures. This paper examines <b>cross-border</b> <b>contagion</b> risk over the period 1999 - 2006. To that purpose we use aggregate cross-border exposures of 17 countries {{as reported in the}} Bank for International Settlements Consolidated Banking Statistics. We find that a shock that affects the liabilities of one country may undermine the stability of the entire financial system. Particularly, a shock wiping out 25 % (35 %) of US (UK) cross-border liabilities against non-US (non-UK) banks could lead to bank contagion eroding at least 94 % (45 %) of the recipient countries' banking assets. We also find that since 2006 a shock to Eastern Europe, Turkey and Russia affects most countries. Our simulations also reveal that the 'speed of propagation of contagion' has increased in recent years resulting in a higher number of directly exposed banking systems. Finally, we find that contagion is more widespread in geographical proximities. Copyright (c) 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) International Review of Finance Ltd. 2010. ...|$|E
40|$|Large {{and growing}} {{international}} financial linkages between East and West {{have altered the}} nature of the stability risks faced by European banking systems, increasing susceptibility to contagion. This paper aims to identify potential risks of <b>cross-border</b> <b>contagion</b> using a sample of large Western and Eastern European banks. We assume that contagion risk is associated with extreme co-movements in a market-based measure of bank soundness, controlling for common underlying factors. We also find evidence that contagion risk across European banks heightened significantly during the recent crisis. Contagion among Western European banks with the highest market share in Eastern Europe and from this group to Eastern European banks shows the largest increase in our sample. We find also evidence of contagion spreading from Eastern European banks, but this effect seems to reflect a broader phenomenon of contagion from emerging markets to banks in advanced countries exposed to these markets. Finally, our findings offer only mixed evidence of the existence of a direct ownership channel in the transmission of contagion.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to examine <b>cross-border</b> <b>contagion</b> effects during the 2007 - 09 crisis in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and from all the possible propagation channels, it chooses to focus on cross-border bank loans. It tries to discover which global and local factors had significant influence on the changes in bank loans from banks in source (lending) countries to banks, as well as households, corporations and government in host (borrowing) countries. The main research method is a panel data regression model. The empirical results suggest that both local and global factors had influence on the changes in cross-border loans, i. e. helped to spread the 2007 - 09 crisis to CEE. The significant local factors were macroeconomic and financial characteristics of both source and host countries, such as their GDP growth differential, interest rate differential, FDI, or profitability and health of the banking sector. The significant global factors were the expected market volatility and investors' risk appetite/aversion which was an indicator of "pure" contagion. The main contribution of this thesis lies in its focus on CEE and the analysis of investors' behavior based on their changing risk appetite...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} accounting harmonization on cross-border capital market contagion. Employing a sample of approximately 14, 000 firms across 35 countries for the period 2001 - 2010, I document an increase in <b>cross-border</b> <b>contagion</b> amongst IFRS adopting markets. After controlling for common macro-level exposures and bilateral trade linkages, I find significant clustering {{in the incidence of}} extreme negative market returns across IFRS adopting countries, relative to the clustering observed across non-adopting countries. Providing further insight, I show that liquidity shocks—captured by the volatility of liquidity—originating in foreign markets have a significantly greater impact on the variability of local market liquidity when both the foreign and local markets follow IFRS. Cross-sectional analysis of IFRS adopters shows my documented contagion results are more pronounced within countries that experienced the greatest increase in foreign portfolio investment around the adoption of IFRS. Conversely, the observed impact of foreign liquidity shocks on local markets is attenuated in countries that experienced the greatest increase in reporting transparency post-IFRS adoption. These results are robust to several sensitivity tests and alternative specifications. Taken together, the evidence presented in this study suggests that equity market integration associated with IFRS adoption also imposes a significant market cost by opening local markets to foreign idiosyncratic shocks...|$|E
40|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2008 bears lessons for regulators and academics on {{the causes of}} financial collapse, crisis contagion and the regulation of risk. The 2008 crisis was generated in the banking sector, and permitted by lax regulation on how banks lend money. This article outlines {{the reasons for the}} crisis, the means of financial contagion from the United States {{to the rest of the}} developed world, the response by global institutions and develops an argument in favour of using the institutions of global governance to re-regulate the financial services sector, significantly restricting the use of financial instruments that encouraged the crisis. The main thesis of this paper is that the {{financial crisis}} (1) exposed gaps in the regulation of financial services, (2) exposed limits in efficacy and serious side-effects of relying on central bank LLR functions as a counter-steering mechanism, (3) exposed the incapability of national regulators to fully prevent <b>cross-border</b> <b>contagion</b> and (4) underlined the importance of a paradigm shift, a conceptual rejection of market-based regulation built up after the last financial crisis in the early 1990 s as a prerequisite for moving forward on global governance solutions.

This study looks for, using an exploratory factor analysis approach, the possible linkage of the Indian IT sector with the domestic stock market {{as well as with the}} outer world, particularly, the US and French market over different phases of stock price movements. Over the eleven-year study-period from 1999 to 2009, global stock market has witnessed two significant crises. While, the first crisis was confined to the IT sector, the second one has been most general and encompassing in nature. Most surprisingly, Indian IT sector remained strictly decoupled from the global IT markets during the period of IT-revolution and the consequent stock price crash. Even during the period of recovery that followed, Indian IT sector remained more closely associated with the domestic market. The integration of the Indian IT sector with the global IT market has been achieved only since 2007. During the period of the last financial crisis and the recent recovery, Indian IT sector have been completely dissociated from the domestic market. Such isolation of the sector from the other domestic sectors might provide opportunities for domestic portfolio diversification. The sector, however, is now exposed to industry specific risks...|$|E

We analyze international interdependencies of Irish banks—during both normal times and in periods of large shocks or extreme events—using an existing methodology with distance to default (DD) data constructed from the banks ’ equity prices. The data covers daily observations from January 1994 to November 2005. We first construct rolling correlations between DDs of Irish banks and those of banks from other European countries and the U. S. to analyze trends in cross-country interdependencies. We then use a multinomial logit model to estimate the number of banks in Ireland that experience a large shock {{on the same day}} as banks in other countries (“coexceedances”), controlling for Ireland-specific and global factors. We find evidence of increasing cross-border interdependencies over time; differing interlinkage patterns in the pre-Euro, post-Euro, and the post-September 11 th periods; and significant <b>cross-border</b> <b>contagion</b> risk from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands.

40|$|AbstractMany {{scientists}} and economists {{state that the}} degree of global integration of the Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) stock markets is very low. However, the recent turmoils in the major financial centers in USA, China, etc. raise the question about the possible transmission of the global shocks to the CEECs stock markets despite the low degree of financial integration. The main research questions are: can the spillover effect transmit from the major stock markets on the CEECs stock markets and what type of shocks cause the <b>cross-border</b> <b>contagion</b> risk transmission to the CEECs stock markets? The objective of this study – to identify the transmission of global shocks through stock markets channel in the CEECs. The research methods: the systemic, logical and comparative analysis of the scientific literature and statistical methods: Dynamic Conditional Correlation Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (DCC-GARCH) model. The empirical {{results of this study suggest}} that the highest degree of global and regional integration of the stock markets was observed in Poland's, Czech Republic's, and Hungary's stock markets that can be explained by higher development level of these stock markets comparing to other CEECs. The collapse of Lehman Brothers bank in United States in 2008 was the most significant shock transmitted to CEECs stock markets. The empirical results also suggest that the transmission of other systemic shocks (e. g. the Middle East financial markets crash (May 2006), Greek debt crisis (April 23, 2010), Portugal's debt crisis (May 16, 2011)) was also observed on some of the CEECs countries...|$|E
40|$|This {{issue of}} the CNB Research Bulletin looks at {{advances}} {{in the area of}} financial stability. Financial stability issues have attracted the attention of central banks in the last 10 years, mainly due to the rapid development of financial systems, the emergence of new financial products and the increased integration of the financial system across borders. These issues are extremely important for the Czech financial sector as well. One of the most widely used analytical tools for evaluating the stability of the financial sector is stress testing. The first article – by Jaroslav Heřmánek, Petr Jakubík and Michal Hlaváček – describes progress in this area as compared to earlier versions of stress testing. Progress has been made primarily in the areas of modelling credit risk and linking the stress testing to the CNB’s official macroeconomic forecast. The second and third articles – by Adam Geršl and by Alexis Derviz and Jiří Podpiera – are devoted to the issue of cross border-contagion in the Czech Republic. This problem is of great importance for the Czech Republic due to the strong foreign ownership of the Czech banking sector and the increasing crossborder flows of capital. The article by Adam Geršl uses macroeconomic data from BIS and compares the threats of <b>cross-border</b> <b>contagion</b> from other CEECs using a common creditor index.
