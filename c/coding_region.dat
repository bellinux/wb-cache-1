5|$|Messenger RNA (mRNA) is RNA {{that has}} a <b>coding</b> <b>region</b> {{that acts as a}} {{template}} for protein synthesis (translation). The rest of the mRNA, the untranslated regions, tune how active the mRNA is. There are also many RNAs that are not translated, called non-coding RNAs. Like the untranslated regions, many of these non-coding RNAs have regulatory roles.|$|E
5|$|Surfactant protein A (SP-A) is {{a protein}} of 248 amino acids usually found in large {{oligomeric}} structures. The mature SP-A1 monomer is a 35kDa protein that differs from SP-A2 in four amino acids at the <b>coding</b> <b>region.</b> The structure of SP-A1 monomers {{consists of four}} domains: an N-terminal, a collagen-like domain, a neck region, and a carbohydrate recognition domain. The C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) allows binding to various types of microorganisms and molecules.|$|E
5|$|Differences in the SFTPA1 gene {{sequence}} at the <b>coding</b> <b>region</b> determine SP-A genetic variants or haplotypes among individuals. More than 30 variants {{have been}} identified and characterized for SFTPA1 (and SFTPA2) in the population. SFTPA1 variants result from nucleotide changes in the codons of amino acids 19, 50, 62, 133, and 219. Two of these do not modify the SP-A1 protein sequence (amino acids 62 and 133), whereas the rest result in amino acid substitutions (amino acid 19, 50, 133, and 219). Four SP-A1 variants (6A, 6A2, 6A3, 6A4) are in higher frequency in the general population. The most frequently found variant is 6A2.|$|E

50|$|<b>Coding</b> <b>regions</b> are {{composed}} of codons, which are decoded and translated (in eukaryotes usually into one and in prokaryotes usually into several) into proteins by the ribosome. <b>Coding</b> <b>regions</b> begin with the start codon and end with a stop codon. In general, the start codon is an AUG triplet and the stop codon is UAA, UAG, or UGA. The <b>coding</b> <b>regions</b> tend to be stabilised by internal base pairs, this impedes degradation. In addition to being protein-coding, portions of <b>coding</b> <b>regions</b> may serve as regulatory sequences in the pre-mRNA as exonic splicing enhancers or exonic splicing silencers.|$|R

More than 30 variants {{have been}} identified and characterized for SFTPA2 (and SFTPA1) in the population. SFTPA2 variants result from nucleotide changes in the codons of amino acids 9, 91, 140, and 223. Three of these do not modify the SP-A2 protein sequence (amino acids 9, 91, and 223), whereas the remaining one results in an amino acid substitution (amino acid 140). Six SP-A2 variants (1A, 1A0, 1A1, 1A2, 1A3, 1A5) are in higher frequency in the general population. The most frequently found variant is 1A0.|$|E
5|$|Many protein-coding genes {{have more}} than one {{polyadenylation}} site, so a gene can code for several mRNAs that differ in their 3' end. Since alternative polyadenylation changes the length of the 3' untranslated region, it can change which binding sites for microRNAs the 3' untranslated region contains. MicroRNAs tend to repress translation and promote degradation of the mRNAs they bind to, although there are examples of microRNAs that stabilise transcripts. Alternative polyadenylation can also shorten the <b>coding</b> <b>region,</b> thus making the mRNA code for a different protein, but this is much less common than just shortening the 3' untranslated region.|$|E
25|$|Every mRNA {{consists}} of three parts: a 5' untranslated region (5'UTR), a protein-coding region or open reading frame (ORF), and a 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). The <b>coding</b> <b>region</b> carries information for protein synthesis encoded by the genetic code to form triplets. Each triplet of nucleotides of the <b>coding</b> <b>region</b> is called a codon and corresponds to a binding site complementary to an anticodon triplet in transfer RNA. Transfer RNAs with the same anticodon sequence always carry an identical type of amino acid. Amino acids are then chained together by the ribosome according {{to the order of}} triplets in the <b>coding</b> <b>region.</b> The ribosome helps transfer RNA to bind to messenger RNA and takes the amino acid from each transfer RNA and makes a structure-less protein out of it. Each mRNA molecule is translated into many protein molecules, on average ~2800 in mammals.|$|E

40|$|Identifying protein-coding {{regions in}} DNA {{sequences}} {{is an active}} issue in computational biology. In this study, we present a self adaptive spectral rotation (SASR) approach, which visualizes <b>coding</b> <b>regions</b> in DNA sequences, based on investigation of the Triplet Periodicity property, without any preceding training process. It is proposed {{to help with the}} rough <b>coding</b> <b>regions</b> prediction when there is no extra information for the training required by other outstanding methods. In this approach, at each position in the DNA sequence, a Fourier spectrum is calculated from the posterior subsequence. Following the spectrums, a random walk in complex plane is generated as the SASR's graphic output. Applications of the SASR on real DNA data show that patterns in the graphic output reveal locations of the <b>coding</b> <b>regions</b> and the frame shifts between them: arcs indicate <b>coding</b> <b>regions,</b> stable points indicate non-coding regions and corners’ shapes reveal frame shifts. Tests on genomic data set from Saccharomyces Cerevisiae reveal that the graphic patterns for <b>coding</b> and non-coding <b>regions</b> differ to a great extent, so that the <b>coding</b> <b>regions</b> can be visually distinguished.

25|$|PON1 {{in humans}} is encoded by the PON1 gene {{which is located}} on the long arm of {{chromosome}} 7. Although many nutritional, life-style and pharmaceutical modulators of PON1 are known., by far the biggest effect on PON1 activity levels, which can vary by over 40 fold between individuals, is through PON1 genetic polymorphisms. The <b>coding</b> <b>region</b> PON1-Q192R polymorphism determines a substrate dependent effect on activity. Some substrates e.g. paraoxon are hydrolysed faster by the R- isoform while others such as diazoxon and lipid-peroxides are hydrolysed more rapidly by the Q- isoform. Both the <b>coding</b> <b>region</b> PON1-L55M and the promoter region PON1-T-108C polymorphisms are associated with different serum concentrations and therefore activities. The 55L allele results in significantly higher PON1 mRNA and serum protein levels and therefore activity compared to the 55M allele. The -108C allele has greater promoter activity than the -108T allele which results in different serum activities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Sequencing {{technologies}} used {{to generate}} long strands of DNA are susceptible to laboratory errors that may result in several DNA nucleotides being deleted from the genome. Detecting such deletions in the protein <b>coding</b> <b>regions</b> is of utmost importance. Missing even a single nucleotide may lead to frame shifts with all the following codons (and consequently the encoded amino acids) being identified incorrectly. In addition to the deletion of nucleotides during sequencing, frame shifts can occur because {{of a variety of}} other reasons including mutations. In this paper, we present a fast computational technique to identify frame shifts in protein <b>coding</b> <b>regions</b> in DNA sequences.

25|$|The mtDNA haplogroups of Europeans are {{surveyed}} {{by using a}} combination of data from RFLP analysis of the <b>coding</b> <b>region</b> and sequencing of the hypervariable segment I. About 99% of European mtDNAs fall into one of ten haplogroups: H, I, J, K, M, T, U, V, W or X (Torroni et al. 1996a). Each of these is defined by certain relatively ancient and stable polymorphic sites located in the <b>coding</b> <b>region</b> (Torroni et al. 1996a)... Haplogroup H, which is defined by the absence of an AluI site at bp 7025, is the most prevalent, comprising half of all Europeans (Torroni et al. 1996a, Richards et al. 1998)... Six of the European haplogroups (H, I, J, K, T and W) are essentially confined to European populations (Torroni et al. 1994, 1996a), and probably originated after the ancestral Caucasoids became genetically separated from the ancestors of the modern Africans and Asians. Genetic studies suggest some maternal gene flow to eastern Europe from eastern Asia or southern Siberia 13,000 – 6,600 years BP. Analysis of Neolithic skeletons in the Great Hungarian Plain found a high frequency of eastern Asian mtDNA haplogroups, some of which survive in modern eastern European populations. Maternal gene flow to Europe from sub-Saharan Africa began as early as 11,000 years BP, although the majority of lineages, approximately 65%, are estimated to have arrived more recently, including during the Romanization period, the Arab conquests of southern Europe, and during the Atlantic slave trade.|$|E
