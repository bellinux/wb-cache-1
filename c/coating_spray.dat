30|$|As {{alternative}} to the rigid TCOs, various flexible TCEs have been studied using carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, conducting polymers such as poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), or metal nanowires (NWs) such as Ag-NWs and Cu-NWs [4, 5]. Many of the recently developed flexible TCEs have several problems such as lacking junctions between the conducting materials or low stability under ambient circumstance [6], where as they have comparable transmittances and sheet resistances with TCOs. Among various TCEs, Ag-NWs have been intensively studied due to its excellent conductivity and flexibility [7, 8]. Ag-NWs-based TCEs usually have random networks which can be achieved via inexpensive solution processes such as bar coating, spin <b>coating,</b> <b>spray</b> coating and drop casting [9 – 11]. In this random network, conductivity can be increased by enhancing contacts at the junctions of Ag-NWs, via laminating for instance [12]. However, Ag-NWs have the critical stability issue that is oxidation of Ag to Ag 2 O 3 in air. Such an oxidation significantly affects long-term sheet resistance of the TCE [13]. For this reason, there have been various attempts to prevent oxidation of Ag-NWs. One {{of the most effective}} methods for anti-oxidation is formation of passivation layers on Ag-NWs, such as graphene/Ag or ZnO/Ag [13, 14].|$|E

In addition, the bond <b>coat</b> was <b>sprayed</b> on either by a high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) or a low pressure plasma spray (LPPS). The residual adhesion strength of the TBC top coat was evaluated {{as a function of the}} number of thermal cycles by the modified 4 -point bending test. In addition, SEM observations of thermal fatigue cracking morphologies and measurements of the residual stress in the ceramic top coat were carried out. The experimental results indicated that, after thermal cycle fatigue, microcracks were generated in the ceramic top coat; however, they were moderated in a rough interface TBC compared to a smooth interface TBC. In addition, the bond <b>coat</b> <b>sprayed</b> by the HVOF method showed a higher resistance to microcracking than the <b>coat</b> <b>sprayed</b> using the LPPS. Residual stress in the ceramic top coat is almost zero at 0 thermal cycles. After thermal cycle fatigue, it becomes compression; however, it is independent of the bond coat. There was little difference in the adhesion strength by bond coat in as-sprayed conditions. On the other hand, the specimen with a rough interface exhibited higher residual adhesion strength after thermal cycle fatigue compared with the specimens with a relatively smooth interface. In addition, if the bond <b>coat</b> is <b>sprayed</b> by HVOF, the residual adhesion strength increases.

The hydrophobic coating is applied onto flat selective laser sintered (SLS) surfaces prepared from polyamide 12 (PA 12) having a surface roughness of Ra = 20 µm. The hydrophobic coating consists of 5 wt % polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in acetone. The coated substrates are analyzed for roughness using a profilometer, a contact angle using a goniometer, and a coating uniformity and thickness using light and scanning electron microscopes.

40|$|This PhD thesis {{focused on}} {{nanomaterial}} (NM) engineering for occupational health and safety, {{in the frame}} of the EU project “Safe Nano Worker Exposure Scenarios (SANOWORK) ”. Following a safety by design approach, surface engineering (surface coating, purification process, colloidal force control, wet milling, film coating deposition and granulation) were proposed as risk remediation strategies (RRS) to decrease toxicity and emission potential of NMs within real processing lines. In the first case investigated, the PlasmaChem ZrO 2 manufacturing, the colloidal force control applied to the washing of synthesis rector, allowed to reduce ZrO 2 contamination in wastewater, performing an efficient recycling procedure of ZrO 2 recovered. Furthermore, ZrO 2 NM was investigated in the ceramic process owned by CNR-ISTEC and GEA-Niro; the spray drying and freeze drying techniques were employed decreasing NM emissivity, but maintaining a reactive surface in dried NM. Considering the handling operation of nanofibers (NFs) obtained through Elmarco electrospinning procedure, the film coating deposition was applied on polyamide non-woven to avoid free fiber release. For TiO 2 NF the wet milling was applied to reduce and homogenize the aspect ratio, leading to a significant mitigation of fiber toxicity. In the Colorobbia spray coating line, Ag and TiO 2 nanosols, employed to transfer respectively antibacterial or depolluting properties to different substrates, were investigated.

30|$|Textiles {{act as the}} {{carriers}} for microorganisms, such as pathogenic and odour generating bacteria, mould and fungi causing damage to clothing, strength loss, staining, discoloration and may even cause skin diseases. Antimicrobial finishes maintain hygiene and enables to avoid infection from pathogens especially in hospitals, nursing homes, schools, hotels, and crowded public areas. They prevent unpleasant odour on intimate apparel, underwear, socks and athletic wear. Microbes attack natural fibres because they are hydrophilic in nature. In cotton under certain conditions the presence of carbohydrates acts as nutrients and energy source to microbes. Various other sources of nutrients for microorganisms are soil, dust, solutes from sweat and some textile finishes (Gao and Cranston 2008; Schindler and Hauser 2004; Srivastava 2011). Antimicrobial agents are of two types: leaching and non-leaching. Leaching types work through controlled release mechanism by leaching on the fabric surface or at {{the interior of the}} fibre. These are effective against microbes on the fibre surface or in the surrounding environment and include triclosan (2, 4, 4 ′-trichloro- 2 ′-hydroxydiphenyl ether), copper naphthenate, quaternary ammonium salts, benzimidazol derivatives etc. Non-leaching types bind to the fibre surfaces and control those microbes that come in contact with the fibre surface only. This type includes chitosan, octadecyl aminodimethyl trimethoxy silylpropyl ammonium chloride, poly-hexamethyl biguanide etc. Antimicrobial finishes can be applied on textile substrates by exhaust, pad-dry-cure, <b>coating,</b> <b>spray</b> methods or in spinning dope (Dorugade and Bhagyashri 2010; Elshafei and El-Zanfaly 2011; Mao 2002; Ristić et al. 2011; Shrivastava et al. 2011; Technical Bulletin 2004). Antimicrobial agents control the growth of microbes by various mechanisms ranging from preventing cell reproduction, blocking of enzymes, reaction with the cell membrane to the destruction of the cell walls and poisoning the cell from within (Schindler and Hauser 2004). Various requirements of these finishes in textiles are durability to washing, dry cleaning and hot pressing, no harmful effects to the user and the environment, compliance with the statutory requirements of regulating agencies, compatible with the chemical processes and easy application without deteriorating fabric quality (Schindler and Hauser 2004; Thiry 2010).|$|E
40|$|Liquid drops play a {{dominant}} role in numerous industrial applications, such as spray <b>coating,</b> <b>spray</b> painting, inkjet printing, lithography processes, and spraying/sprinkling in agriculture or gardening. In {{all of these}} examples, the generation, flight, impact, and spreading of drops are separate stages of the corresponding industrial processes, which are all thoroughly studied for many years. This thesis focuses on drop dynamics, impact phenomena, Leidenfrost drops, and pouring flows. Based on extensive analysis and numerical results, various mechanisms by which drops can deform are resolved in detail, in both fundamental and industrial contexts. The title of the thesis, Dynamics of Deforming Drops, can be explained in two ways. Drops can be deformed and moving drops can deform another liquid surface. Large {{part of the study}} focuses on the small scale deformations of the liquid surface(s) {{at the bottom of the}} impacting drop/object, induced by the force exerted by the gas that is squeezed out between the falling object and the bottom surface. This can result in small air bubble entrapment, which is generally undesired in applications. The results of interferometry experiments and Boundary Integral simulations show that there exists a maximal entrained bubble size for some impact velocity. The mechanism of small air bubble entrapment applies for impact of a liquid drop onto a solid surface, impact of a liquid drop onto a (deep) pool, and impact of a solid sphere onto a pool. Other covered subjects are the high-speed impact of a train of microdrops on a pool, instabilities at Leidenfrost drops, drop deformation induced by the impact of a picosecond laser-pulse, and pouring flows. The study of the response of drops impacted by a focused laser pulse is motivated by Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which is used for the creation of nanometer-sized patterns on electronic chips in, for example, mobile phones. To print the features at high resolution, one needs high energy radiation. In EUV-machines this radiation results from liquid tin sheets that are impacted by a laser-pulse, resulting in the formation of plasma. The fluid dynamics play a crucial role for improving the efficiency of the EUV machine...|$|E

40|$|The {{remarkable}} price drop in {{high cost}} infrared detectors {{can be expected}} with recent advances in colloidal quantum dots(CQDs) and {{organic light emitting diodes}} (OLED). Both have several advantages such as cost-effective, easy solution processing, and compatibility with large area and flexible device manufacturing. Easy control of the solutions enables the layer-deposition with spin <b>coating,</b> <b>spray</b> coating, and roll-to-roll processing. It is also possible to apply on flexible and curved substrates. When OLED is applied for the infrared photodetectors as light emitters, it is possible to industrialize the infrared optical imaging devices with low cost. The infrared detector based on CQDs have high dark currents due to the narrow bandgap of crystals. With hybrid blocking layers, dark current can be reduced significantly. On the structure of photodetector, OLED was deposited using evaporation. ZnO can block the injection of holes from outer circuit; the up-conversion devices can persist up to 17 V. Upon excitation with the infrared light, the device activates at voltages 7 V with an onset of green light emission. However, maximum photon to photon conversion is 1. 3 % at peak wavelength. One reasons for the low efficiency is surface traps of the nanocrystals. The trap sites act as recombination centers and thereby, degrade the conversion efficiency. In the dissertation, new approaches to enhance the performance of the CQDs for infrared photodetectors are investigated. Instead of PbSe for CQDs, PbS CQDs are used due to better stability in air. Conventional hot injection method was modified, and long term “size focused” stage can be achieved with narrow size distribution. Slow growth conditions provide nanocrystals with high quality, which improves the performances of devices. In order to increase the photon to electron efficiency,photocurrent amplification is investigated. The efficiency can be enhanced by modification of the interface between organic layer and metal electrode. The electrical states at this interface were totally changed by metal diffusion into the organic layer and they work as hole trap sites. Photon to electron efficiency was observed to increase more than 16, 000 %. The highest specific detectivity was achieved of 7. 0 × 1013 Jones...|$|E
40|$|Icing is {{a problem}} for several industries, and current methods for removal of ice have several {{difficulties}} as they are time consuming, energy intensive and may be environmentally harmful. A better solution to the icing problems is the introduction of an anti-icing surface which hinders ice formation and reduces ice adhesion if formed. Such surfaces have received {{a great deal of attention}} the last years, and one of the most investigated candidates is superhydrophobic surfaces. Such surfaces offer several advantages as they repel water, reduce the probability of ice forming due to low contact area, and can reduce ice adhesion, but their durability and performance under icing conditions have been questioned. In this work superhydrophobic surfaces, exhibiting contact angles above 150 degree and roll-off angles lower than 10 degree, on steel have been produced by a simple and scalable method. The substrates have been sandblasted with both fine and coarse sand and SiO 2 -nanoparticles have been deposited, yielding a hierarchical surface structure. The surface chemistry has been altered by the addition of a hydrophobic coating layer based on the precursor 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane. The method for depositing both nanoparticles and the hydrophobic top layer has been optimized by a systematic investigation of several coating techniques, including dip <b>coating,</b> <b>spray</b> coating, spin coating and vapor deposition. The surface with the best superhydrophobic characters was achieved when spray coating of nanoparticles was done on a steel surface sandblasted with fine sand, and the top layer was deposited by dip coating. The surface achieved a contact angle of 158 +- 2 degree with distilled water, a roll-off angle of 8 +- 2 degree and contact angle hysteresis of 19 +- 3 degree. Icing characteristics of the surfaces produced have been tested in an environmental chamber, where the barrier against ice formation, the delay of ice formation at - 10 degree C and the cyclic icing/de-icing character have been investigated. The sample showing the best hydrophobic characteristic also showed the highest barrier against ice formation with a minimum temperature of - 14. 8 degree C. However, other samples showed longer freezing delays (longer than 1 hour) and in general no direct correlation between hydrophobic properties and anti-icing properties was found. In addition, the hydrophobic character of the surfaces was found to depend a lot on the humidity and temperature, and no samples showed contact angles above 150 degree when cooled down to 5 degree C...|$|E

In addition, membrane method we developed enables to fabricate thin film by simple filtration. The filtration is implemented with a target material {{to make a film}} on Anodisc. Then, the produced films were floated on the surface of KOH to remove Anodisc. Finally, it was able to be transferred to any substrate needed. The films were characterized by SEM, AFM, Raman and UV-Vis, which reveals that the TMD film was uniformly distributed on any substrate which is including another film fabricated by the same membrane method. We also demonstrated that the coverage of TMD on the substrate or film can be controlled by mass of the material in filtration step. We believe that further work with optimization of the photoelectrode structure will significantly enhance photocurrent efficiencies. Therefore, the future possibility to have hydrogen energy at a low cost, with clean material to the environment, seems to be closer, since most of the demands for an appropriate hydrogen evolution material are achieved by TMDs. The production of hydrogen by photocatalytic water splitting has attracted much, recently. Photocatalytic material requires two characteristics, capability of exciton generation and catalytic surface for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Since transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) satisfy these requirements, it has been investigated for their application as photocatalyst over the past few decades. The most popular TMD material, MoS 2, has a two different crystal phase, 1 T- and 2 H- MoS 2, and they have metallic- and semiconducting-properties, respectively. 1 T-MoS 2 shows outstanding catalytic effect for HER, and exfoliated 2 H-MoS 2 has a direct band-gap for light absorption. However, the photocatalytic efficiency of such TMDs nanosheets for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is still not enough for the practical use as catalyst, which is supposed to be caused by the inevitable restacking TMDs nanosheets during electrode preparation process. Moreover, the low conductivity of TMDs impedes the electrons transport upon HER. MoS 2 based heterostructure with high conducting material has been regarded as a candidate to overcome these limitations. Therefore, the development of for scalable fabrication methods for MoS 2 based heterostructure remains as an important challenge in TMD-based research field. Here, we present a facile synthetic method to fabricate TMD electrode on transparent electrode indium tin oxide (ITO) for PEC and characterization of TMD-based hybrid thin film. Monolayer of graphene oxide (GO) and MoS 2 sheets were prepared by modified hummers method and n-butyllithium intercalation method, respectively. Then, TMD-based films were deposited on ITO substrate by several methodsope...|$|E
