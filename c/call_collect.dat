50|$|Ballymore was {{retired from}} racing {{and became a}} {{breeding}} stallion at the Ardenode Stud, ostensibly {{as a replacement for}} his sire Ragusa who had died in May 1973. He began his stud career at a fee of 1,500 guineas. The best of his offspring included More So (Irish 1000 Guineas), Ore (Henry II Stakes), Seymour Hicks (Great Voltigeur Stakes), Exdirectory (runner-up in the Irish Derby), More Heather (Park Stakes), Raqcuette (third in the Epsom Oaks) and <b>Call</b> <b>Collect</b> (Foxhunter Chase). He died in June 1986 at the age of seventeen.|$|E
5000|$|Numerous alumni NFL {{players who}} played under Coach Headen and his {{predecessor}} Coach Gregory Fuller have given back to Woodson. Some {{have paid for}} championship rings, equipment, etc. Some sent the Headens and the entire girls' basketball team, for national tournaments, airline tickets to express their gratitude for his unwavering dedication and commitment. Former players who lived {{too far away to}} see Coach Headen in person, continue to find ways to keep in touch. The Headens even encouraged them to <b>call</b> <b>collect,</b> anytime, but the bills became astronomical.|$|E

50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>Collect</b> {{had won the}} {{previous}} years Topham Chase over one circuit of the course. Questions over his stamina were answered {{when he won the}} Cheltenham Foxhunter Chase three weeks before coming to Aintree. Public confidence in his chances began to fade in the hours before the race as it was thought the ground conditions might not be in his favour. In partnership with his amateur rider, Mr Ray Martin, the pair went off at 14/1 but were well to the rear throughout the race before making ground through the tiring field to finish seventh, getting their only mention from the television commentator as they passed the post.|$|E
50|$|In 1973 Kenn Kaufman {{and another}} birder, Floyd Murdoch, went after Parker's record. As recounted {{in the book}} Kingbird Highway, both broke the old record by a wide margin. Murdoch {{finished}} with 669 in the newly described ABA area to Kaufman's 666. Kaufman set a North American record of 671 species, {{with the addition of}} five species that he had seen in Baja California. Murdoch's record was broken in 1979 by James M. Vardaman, as recorded in his book <b>Call</b> <b>Collect,</b> Ask for Birdman. Vardaman saw 699 species that year and travelled 161,332 miles (137,145 by airplane; 20,305 by car; 3,337 by boat; 160 by bicycle; and 385 by foot). Benton Basham, in 1983, topped that with a total of 710. 1987 marked the second time that there was a competition during a single year, with Steve Perry ending up with 711 and Sandy Komito setting a new standard with 722. In 1992 Bill Rydell made a serious attempt at the record and ended with 714 species for the year.|$|E
40|$|Redistilled phenol is {{a highly}} purified, nucleic acid grade, white {{crystalline}} compound for use in especially critical nucleic acid extractions, as well as chromatographic separations. It's completely free of interfering levels of heavy metals, water, and inhibitors such as H 3 PO 2. BRL redistilled phenol is packaged in amber bottles, with space left for solvent introduction. S 1 nuclease is a purified enzyme that degrades RNA, or denatured DNA, into 5 '-mononucleotides, but will not degrade duplex DNA or RNA/DNA hybrids under appropriate conditions. This makes it useful for detecting the extent of nucleic acid hybridization 2, for determining differences in secondary structures in duplex DNA (e. g., in SV 40 DNA) 3, and {{for the removal of}} nonpaired, &quot;sticky &quot; ends generated during molecular cloning experiments. BRL S 1 nuclease is purified from Aspergillus oryzae by a modification of the method of Vogt. 1 Ordering information: To order, use BRL toll free telephone line:(800) 638 - 8993, in Maryland <b>call</b> <b>collect</b> (301) 340 - 0448, or write to: Bethesda Research Laboratories, Inc. ...|$|E

50|$|A <b>collect</b> <b>call</b> in Canada, Pakistan, and the United States, {{also known}} as a reverse charge call {{in other parts of the}} English-speaking world, is a {{telephone}} call in which the calling party wants to place a call at the called party's expense. In the past, <b>collect</b> <b>calls</b> were only possible as an operator-assisted call, but with the introduction of computer-based telephone dialing equipment, it is now possible to place a <b>collect</b> <b>call</b> without using an operator, which is called automated operator services (AOS) as opposed to Home Country Direct (HCD). Several companies offer services to place <b>collect</b> <b>calls</b> that compete with local service providers. <b>Collect</b> <b>calls</b> can be made from almost any public pay telephone in the world by following directions posted on or near the phone. <b>Collect</b> <b>calling</b> has been in constant decline since the advent of cellular phones and VOIP products, which can offer cheaper international rates.|$|R

30|$|An approach, {{which is}} totally {{different}} from the latter, is that of Cuong Hoang H. Lee [18], which achieves security in a Xen based hypervisor [19] by trapping hypercalls, as they are fewer than system calls. The hypercalls are checked before their execution and thus malicious ones can be detected. A {{combination of the two}} latter methods takes advantage of the system <b>calls,</b> <b>collecting</b> them and classifying them in normal and abnormal through binary weighted cosine metric and k nearest neighbour classifier [20].|$|R
50|$|For long-distance <b>collect</b> <b>calls,</b> 90 is {{used instead}} of 0 as the trunk code, and a carrier {{selection}} code must still be used.

50|$|These {{components}} form a {{basic tariff}} system but, as telecommunication advances, tariff structures become increasingly more complex. Usually {{there is the}} option of <b>calling</b> <b>collect</b> (in the UK known as reversing charges), where responsibility for charges normally paid by the caller is accepted by the recipient. Tariffs also depend on the bandwidth provided. For example, dial-up modem connections are charged at normal telephone costs, but connections such as DSL are usually charged using a completely different accounting system due to their always on nature.|$|R

50|$|The {{urinary system}} {{refers to the}} {{structures}} that produce and conduct urine {{to the point of}} excretion. The human body normally has two paired kidneys, one on the left and one on the right. Urine is formed by nephrons, the functional unit of the kidney, and then flows through a system of converging tubules <b>called</b> <b>collecting</b> ducts. The collecting ducts join together to form minor calyces, then major calyces, which ultimately join the pelvis of the kidney (renal pelvis). Urine flows from the renal pelvis into the ureter, a tube-like structure that carries the urine from the kidneys into the bladder.|$|R
