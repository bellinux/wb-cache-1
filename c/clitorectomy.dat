Intersex medical interventions are encouraged {{as early as}} possible in both Hong Kong and the People's Republic. A 2014 clinical review of 22 infants with congenital adrenal hyperplasia in Hong Kong, for example, shows that all infants in the study received <b>clitorectomies.</b> It also showed a preference for early surgeries when infants are aged 1-2 years, and an assessment of surgical success focusing on genital appearance and necessity for further cosmetic surgeries.|$|R
2500|$|By 1970, {{surgeons}} {{still considered}} {{it easier to}} [...] "dig a hole" [...] than [...] "build a pole," [...] but had abandoned [...] "barbaric" [...] <b>clitorectomies</b> in favor of [...] "nerve sparing" [...] clitoral recession and promised orgasms when the girls grew up. Pediatric endocrinology, surgery, child psychology, and sexuality textbooks recommended sex reassignment for a male whose penis was irreparably malformed or [...] "too small to stand to urinate or penetrate a vagina," [...] because the surgeons claimed {{to be able to}} construct vaginas where none existed. The majority of these genetic males who were reassigned and surgically converted had cloacal exstrophy-type malformations or extreme micropenis (typically less than 1.5cm). In 1972 John Money published his influential text on the development of gender identity, and reported successful reassignment at age 22 months of a boy (David Reimer) who had lost his penis to a surgical accident. This experiment proved not to be as successful as Money claimed. David Reimer grew up as a girl, but never identified as one. Academic sexologist Milton Diamond later reported that Reimer failed to identify as female since the age of 9 to 11, making the transition to living as a male at age 15. Reimer later went public with his story to discourage similar medical practices. He later committed suicide, owing to suffering years of severe depression, financial instability, and a troubled marriage.|$|R
5000|$|Clitoridectomy or <b>clitorectomy</b> is the {{surgical}} removal, reduction, or partial {{removal of the}} clitoris. It is rarely used as a therapeutic medical procedure, such as when cancer has developed in or spread to the clitoris. It is often performed on intersex newborns. Commonly, non-medical removal of the clitoris is performed during female genital mutilation (FGM).|$|E

Potential surgical problems: The primary effect of this surgery, not surprisingly, is a drastic reduction in ability to experience orgasm. The appearance is not very normal. Regrowth of unwanted erectile tissue has sometimes presented problems.|$|E

40|$|America advocates feminising genital {{surgery for}} all {{children}} with ambiguous genitalia assigned to a fe-male sex of rearing 4, 5. A standard infant feminising genitoplasty involves removal {{of some of the}} clitoris to reduce its size, construction of a vagina or opening the vaginal introitus and sometimes refashioning of the labia. In some European centres removal of the whole clitoris (<b>clitorectomy)</b> is still the procedure of choice for the enlarged clitoris 6. Proponents of femi-nising genitoplasty in infancy cite both psychological reasons such as stable gender identity development and a better psychosexual and psychosocial outcome as well as physical reasons such as menstruation and sexual intercourse in later life. It is important for cli-nicians to know whether all or any of these outcomes are achieved and this information can only be obtained by well designed long-term follow-up studies. Available Data Unfortunately, there are few available objective, long-term outcome data from representative groups of intersex adults. Collection of data has been ham-pered by widespread policies of non-disclosure of di-agnosis. Patients remain unaware of their diagnosis, unable to access medical or peer support and unavail-able for recruitment in long-term follow-up studies. This practice is becoming less common but is still re-commended policy in many centres. In addition, sur-gery for ambiguous genitalia is so widespread {{that it is difficult to}} recruit patients who have not had sur-gery. Most published studies are collections of smal...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. 21 α-hydroxylase {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} frequent cause of virilization in patients with female karyotype due to exposure of a female fetus to excess of androgen. We report anatomical and cosmetic results of feminizing genital reconstruction of two related patients (second cousin) with XX karyotype born with urogenital sinus anomalies (UGS) and not treated at birth. Materials and Metods. Patient 1 is 6 -years old with ambiguous genitalia graded as Prader V and never undergone therapy or surgery. Patient 2 is 10 -years old, graded as Prader IV and subjected to hormonal therapy and clitoral amputation {{at the age of}} 6. Mobilization of urogenital sinus, pull-through of vagina and tubulization of urethra was performed in both after placement of Foley chateters in vagina and bladder by cisto-vaginoscopy. Genitoplasty involved refashioning the tissues to create minora and majora labia and, after removal of corpora, partial <b>clitorectomy</b> was carried in patient 1 and clitoridal reconstruction in patient 2. Result. Vaginal introitus was positioned in the vestibule region below urethral meatus. Foley chateters was removed after two weeks in narcosis and the cosmetic and anatomic result was good. Conclusion. Goals of feminizing genitoplasty are to restore, soon as possible, anatomy achieving a more feminine appareance with a vagina for menstruation, to preserve reproductive capacity and to prevent urological sequelae but it’s also important to contribute in a development of a more stable gender identity. This procedure in two stage, based on an accurate diagnosis, is good to create feminine genital appareance in children with female pseudohermaphroditism expecially if not treated at birth...|$|E
40|$|Proper gender {{assignment}} to a neonate born with ambiguous genitalia {{is a social}} emergency of the newborn period. Once an appropriate sex assignment has been made, the next critical step is performance, if needed, of a reconstructive procedure in a timely fashion. In an attempt to evaluate our experience with this unique group of patients, we have retrospectively reviewed the course of 69 children with ambiguous genitalia managed surgically at this institution between 1974 and 1989. This series consists of 32 genotypic females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), 10 children with mixed gonadal dysgenesis (MGD), 10 male pseudohermaphrodites, 3 true hermaphrodites, 8 genotypic females with urogenital sinus anomalies (UGS), and 6 genotypic males with bilateral undescended testes and penoscrotal hypospadius. All newborns initially seen at this institution received proper sex assignment within {{the first week of}} life. Prior to 1980, 17 of the children with CAH underwent <b>clitorectomy</b> and vaginoplasty and three underwent clitoral recession and vaginoplasty. After 1980, 10 patients with CAH were managed with clitoral recession and vaginoplasty and 2 with vaginoplasty alone. Eight of 10 cases of MGD were given a female sex assignment and all 8 underwent gonadectomy due to the high risk of gonadoblastoma; the other 2 children were raised as males. There were 3 true hermaphrodites of which 2 were assigned female gender roles and were managed with a clitoral recession and vaginoplasty. All 10 male pseudohermaphrodites were raised as females and all underwent bilateral orchidectomy. The 8 children with UGS were raised as females and underwent vaginal reconstruction. Six genotypic males with penoscrotal hypospadius and bilateral undescended testes were raised as males and underwent hypospadius repair and bilateral orchidopexy. This retrospective review underscores the complexities of assessment and management of ambiguous genitalia in infants and children. It also reconfirms the data from other series showing {{that the vast majority of}} infants born with the four most common forms of ambiguous genitalia (CAH, MGD, male pseudoher-maphroditism, and true hermaphroditism) must be raised as females because of inadequacy of the phallus...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Intersex is a {{condition}} of abnormal sexual maturation resulting in abnormal karyotype or primary or secondary sexual characteristics which can be diagnosed by ambiguous genitalia or abnormal characteristics in adolescent. Prevalence of this rare condition is too low (1 in 20, 000 live births). It is very confusing for a doctor to determine the treatment chapter which includes proper diagnostic technique, sufficient time for interpretation and intervention and informing the patient. But the steps are too confusing and controversial. Prescribed case made us highly confused by its characteristics which was none of 5 -alpha reductage deficiency syndrome, Reifensteine Syndrome, Pseudo-harmaphodism and also having a balance between a male and female which is very rare and unique. As the diagnosis was difficult to define, initiatives were taken to reveal the proper diagnosis for better treatment so {{that this kind of}} cases in future could be managed properly. Case Presentation/Description: 15 years old unmarried girl came to Gynaecology outpatient department complaining of primary amenorrhoea, gradual swelling of the external genitalia since 12 years of age and hoarseness of voice since last month. Physically she was tall, with male pattern pubic hair, tanner stage 0 sized breast, having cliteromegaly rather micropenis, perineal hypospadius, palpable mass in both labia major and a blunt space resembling vagina in between. Laboratory investigations revealed very high Testosterone (246 ng/dl) and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (8. 09 mcIU/L) but low level of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (13. 83 IU/L) and Oestrogen (17 pg/dl). Cytogenic study showed 46 XY/ 46 XX mosaic chromosomal pattern. In laparoscopy there was no internal female genital organ. Biopsy of the labial mass was done after operation which depicted seminiferous tubules lined by sertoli cells with no sperm production and interstitial fibrosis. Case was very much mysterious as it was in a balance to support both sexes. After informing the family members first, the society had become an obstruction for the doctors to treat with freedom. Then according to the will of the family members {{and for the sake of}} the society diagnosis was hidden from patient and managed by Gonadectomy, <b>Clitorectomy,</b> and Vaginoplasty in same sitting with hormonal therapy for life long to make her a “girl” again. After 2 months of the treatment patient came with a good respond towards the hormone therapy. Our case proved that ‘Intersex’ is a mystery of nature and do not always follow the known clinical features. Discussion: Sometimes we treat the patient for sake of society, family etc. and never think about the patient’s will. This case was not a different in this aspect. Doctors were bound to follow the rules made by society without protest. Patient of INTERSEX is one of them who have nothing to do against the Nature’s betray. More they need physical rehabilitation, ramification, adaptation and a helping hand to come out of gasping agony inside...|$|E
