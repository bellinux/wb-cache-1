DNA lesions {{can result in}} different phenotypical consequences ranging {{from a number of}} diseases, including cancer, to <b>cellular</b> <b>malfunction,</b> cell death, or aging. To counteract the deleterious effects of DNA damage, cells have developed various repair systems, including biochemical pathways responsible for the removal of single-strand lesions such as base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair (NER) or specialized polymerases temporarily taking over lesion-arrested DNA polymerases during the S phase in translesion synthesis (TLS). There are also other mechanisms of DNA repair such as homologous recombination repair (HRR), nonhomologous end-joining repair (NHEJ), or DNA damage response system (DDR).

40|$|Bone {{morphogenetic}} protein (BMP) signaling {{is active}} in many tissues including the central nervous system, in which it regulates cell proliferation, differentiation and maturation. The modulation of BMP pathway is crucial since abnormality of BMP signaling may cause <b>cellular</b> <b>malfunction</b> such as apoptosis. There are evidences indicating that miR- 17 family {{is involved in the}} BMP signaling. In the present study, we demonstrated that BMP 2 stimulation directly increased the transcription of miR- 17 - 92 and miR- 106 b- 25 cluster via Smad activation, which leads to the up-regulation of mature miR- 17 / 20 a/ 93. In addition, we provided evidence that BMP 2 activation repressed BMPRII expression through modulating miR- 17 family in primary neurons. Furthermore, we proved that such negative regulation protected neurons from apoptosis induced by abnormal BMP signaling. Taken together, these results suggest a regulatory pathway of BMP-miR- 17 family-BMPRII, which consist a negative feedback loop that balances BMP signaling and maintains cell homeostasis in neurons...|$|E

Here, we investigate the mechanistic details {{and effects of}} the NER machinery when it is compromised by a pathologically significant mutation in a subunit of the repair/transcription factor TFIIH, namely XPD. In contrast to previous studies, we find that no single- or double-strand DNA breaks are produced at early time points after UV irradiation of cells bearing a specific XPD mutation, {{despite the presence of}} a clear histone H 2 AX phosphorylation (cH 2 AX) signal in the UV-exposed areas. We show that the observed cH 2 AX signal {{can be explained by the}} presence of longer single-strand gaps possibly generated by strand displacement. Our in vivomeasurements also indicate a strongly reduced TFIIH-XPG binding that could promote single-strand dis-placement at the site of UV lesions. This finding not only highlights the crucial role of XPG’s interactions with TFIIH for proper NER, but also sheds new light on how a faulty DNA repair process can induce extreme genomic instabil-ity in human patients...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{fluorescent}} imaging probes for {{the real}} time detection of <b>cellular</b> <b>malfunctions,</b> such as enzyme over expression has shown promise. Fluorescent dyes with absorption and emission values below 600 nm are limited in their in vivo applications due to high background auto-fluorescence and low resolution images. Employing near infrared (NIR) fluorophores such as cyanine dyes can overcome this disadvantage. Cyanine dyes can be synthesised using solution or solid-phase techniques {{with the use of}} solution phase chemistry allowing for larger scale and higher yielding reactions. Utilising a selection of functional groups and varying polymethine chain lengths a cyanine dye library with tuneable absorption and emission wavelengths was synthesised. This thesis gives the first detailed examples of how modifications on heptamethine cyanine dyes alter their cellular uptake and cellular toxicity. Furthermore, a NIR fluorescent microsphere is reported as well as NIR functionalised microspheres with the ability to be tracked within cells. Additional lines of work involved the synthesis of a fluorescent sensor for the visualisation of bacteria. Aminopeptidases are present within the peptidoglycan cell wall of Gram negative bacteria and therefore can be targeted for real time detection of bacteria to aid in the detection of infectious diseases.

40|$|DNA is {{the carrier}} of genetic {{information}} in living organisms. The information {{stored in the}} nucleotide sequence of DNA is transmitted to the offspring by generating identical copies of the parental DNA molecules.

The structure of DNA can be modified spontaneously by hydrolysis, oxidation, or by environmental factors such as ultra-violet (UV) light, X-rays, or numerous chemical agents.

30|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} suggest that maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and integrity is {{directly linked to}} cellular protection under conditions of cellular stress. In particular, the production of ROS {{is seen as the}} driving force behind mitochondrial dysfunction, playing {{an important role in the}} development of <b>cellular</b> <b>malfunction</b> and organ failure induced by inflammatory mediators and hypoxia [4, 59 – 61]. Basic OXPHOS activity of mitochondria is controlled mainly by substrate and ADP availability and by the specific composition of respiratory supercomplexes in mitochondria [62]. Additional levels of control include allosteric regulation, reversible phosphorylation, and other forms of posttranslational modification. It has been proposed that phosphorylation is of special importance for controlling mitochondrial function [63]. The best evidence for such a mode of regulation is present in the case of protein kinase A (PKA) [64], which affects the activity of several OXPHOS enzymes and thereby serves to modulate ATP generation and ROS production. Notably, also dysfunction of OXPHOS enzymes correlates with clinical deterioration in sepsis [65]. Other primarily cytoplasmic signaling proteins have been suggested to regulate mitochondrial ROS production, both positively and negatively [66 – 68].|$|E
40|$|Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) {{have been}} found to be {{involved}} in a myriad of cellular function, including the following: cell-cell communication, cell adhesion and proliferation, neuronal growth and repair, immune response and tumor progression (metastasis). To study the cellular effects of GSL depletion, Radin developed the first known inhibitors of the enzyme responsible for the initial glycosylation of the lipid portion (ceramide) of the glycosphingolipid. This inhibitor, PDMP (1 -phenyl 2 -decanoyl amino 3 -morpholino 1 -propanol), not only suppresses the initial glycosylation, but also inhibits the formation of all preceding glycosphingolipids and causes the accumulation of ceramide, an active participant in cellular apoptosis (or programmed cell death). Using a developed procedure, PDMP analogues with truncations about the aromatic region were synthesized. Aromatic PDMP analogues were more potent than the lead compound when tested against isolated embryonic cells from the Manduca sexta. Later procedures developed allowed for the manufacturing of head group analogue, which allowed for the generation of a water-soluble PDMP analogue. A new synthetic protocol, using a commercially available advanced intermediate, permitted the production of enantiomerically pure PDMP in five steps with an overall yield of 50 %. As these compounds gain more medicinal attention, we hope to use PDMP and analogues, combined with the Manduca sexta as a model system, to gain a greater understanding of GSL functionality and <b>cellular</b> <b>malfunctions</b> [...] -including cancer metastasis...|$|R
40|$|Newly {{synthesised}} proteins need to fold, {{often to}} intricate and close-packed structures, {{in order to}} function. The underlying mechanism by which this complex process takes place both in vitro and in vivo is now becoming understood, at least in general terms, {{as a result of}} the application of a wide range of biophysical and computational methods used in combination with the techniques of biochemistry and protein engineering. It is increasingly apparent, however, that folding is not only crucial for generating biological activity, but that it is also coupled to a wide range of processes within the cell, ranging from the trafficking of proteins to specific organelles to the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. Not surprisingly, therefore, the failure of proteins to fold appropriately, or to remain correctly folded, is associated with a large number of <b>cellular</b> <b>malfunctions</b> that give rise to disease. Misfolding, and its consequences such as aggregation, can be investigated by extending the types of techniques used to study the normal folding process. Application of these techniques is enabling the development of a unified description of the interconversion and regulation of the different conformational states available to proteins in living systems. Such a description proves a generic basis for understanding the fundamental links between protein misfolding and its associated clinical disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Type II diabetes, and for exploring novel therapeutic strategies directed at their prevention and treatment on a rational basis...|$|R

Twenty-four proteins were differentially expressed in A 53 T -synuclein Drosophila; up-regulation of troponin T and down-regula-tion of fat body protein 1 were confirmed by Western blot analysis. Elevated expressions of heat shock protein 70 cognate 3 and ATP synthase are known to be directly involved in A 53 T -synuclein-mediated toxicity and PD; three up-regulated proteins (muscle LIM protein at 60 A, manganese-superoxide dismutase, and troponin T) and two down-regulated proteins (chaoptin and retinal degen-eration A) have literature-supported associations with <b>cellular</b> <b>malfunctions.</b> That these variations were ob-served in presymptomatic animals may shed light on the etiology of PD.

In this study, we used a Cre-conditional atg 7 KO mouse to investigate the effects of Atg 7 -associated autophagy on ConA-induced murine hepatitis. Our results demonstrated that atg 7 deficiency in mice enhanced macrophage activation and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines upon ConA stimulation.

Mitochondrial morphology is determined by the occurrence of mitochondrial fission and fusion. During normal cell function mitochondria appear as elongated tubular structures. However <b>cellular</b> <b>malfunction</b> induce mitochondria to fragment into punctiform, vesicular structures. This change in morphology has also been associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and early apoptosis. In this study we demonstrated that autofluorescence imaging of mitochondria in living eukaryotic cells provides structural and morphological information {{that can be used to}} describe mitochondrial health. We firstly established the illumination conditions that do not affect mitochondrial structure and calculated the maximum safe light dose that the cells can be exposed to. Subsequently we showed that by sequential recording of mitochondrial fluorescence it is possible to monitor changes in mitochondrial morphology in a continuous non-destructive way. This approach was then applied to describe mitochondrial toxicity induced by potential toxicants exposed to mammalian cells. Both mouse and human cells were used to evaluate mitochondrial toxicity of different compounds with different toxicities.

40|$|Thousands of DNA lesions are {{estimated}} to occur in each cell every day and almost all are recognized and repaired. DNA repair is an essential system that prevents accumulation of mutations {{which can lead to}} serious <b>cellular</b> <b>malfunctions.</b> Phenotypic evaluation of DNA repair activity of individuals is a relatively new approach. Methods to assess base and nucleotide excision repair pathways (BER and NER) in peripheral blood cells based on modified comet assay protocols have been widely applied in human epidemiological studies. These provided some interesting observations of individual DNA repair activity being suppressed among cancer patients. However, extension of these results to cancer target tissues requires a different approach. Here we describe the evaluation of BER and NER activities in extracts from deep-frozen colon biopsies using an upgraded version of the in vitro comet-based DNA repair assay in which twelve reactions on one microscope slide can be performed. The aim of this report is to provide a detailed, easy-to-follow protocol together with results of optimization experiments. Additionally, results obtained by functional assays were analysed in the context of other cellular biomarkers, namely single nucleotide polymorphisms and gene expressions. We have shown that measuring DNA repair activity is not easily replaceable by genomic or transcriptomic approaches, but should be applied with the latter techniques in a complementary manner. The ability to measure DNA repair directly in cancer target tissues might finally answer questions about the tissue-specificity of DNA repair processes and their real involvement in the process of carcinogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Regular {{physical}} activity {{is associated with}} a reduced risk of coronary heart disease, as it probably modifies the balance between free-radical generation and antioxidant activity. On the other hand, however, acute {{physical activity}} increases oxygen uptake and leads to a temporary imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) and their disposal: this phenomenon is called oxidative stress. Proteins {{are one of the most}} important oxidation targets during physical exercise and carbonylation is one of the most common oxidative protein modifications. In cells there is a physiological level of oxidized proteins that doesn't interfere with cell function; however, an increase in oxidized protein levels may cause a series of <b>cellular</b> <b>malfunctions</b> that could lead to a disease state. For this reason the quantification of protein oxidation is important to distinguish a healthy state from a disease state. Several studies have demonstrated an increase of carbonylated plasma proteins in athletes after exercise, but none have identified targets of this oxidation. Recently a process of protein decarbonylation has been discovered, this may indicate that carbonylation could be involved in signal transduction. The aim of our research was to characterize plasma protein carbonylation in response to physical exercise in trained male endurance athletes. We analyzed by proteomic approach their plasma proteins at resting condition and after two different kinds of physical exercise (PE). We used 2 D-GE followed by western blot with specific antibodies against carbonylated proteins. The 2 D analysis identified Haptoglobin as potential protein target of carbonylation after PE. We also identified Serotransferrin and Fibrinogen whose carbonylation is reduced after exercise.

40|$|Osteoporosis is a {{metabolic}} multifaceted disorder, {{characterized by}} insufficient bone strength. It has been recently shown that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) {{play a role}} in senile osteoporosis, through bone cell impairment and altered biomechanical properties. Pentosidine (PENT), a wellcharacterized AGE, is also considered a biomarker of bone fracture. Adequate responses to various hormones, such as 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3, are prerequisites for optimal osteoblasts functioning. Vitamin K 2 is known to enhance in vitro and in vitro vitamin D-induced bone formation. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the effects of Vitamins D 3 and K 2 and PENT on in vitro osteoblast activity, to convey a possible translational clinical message. Ex vivo human osteoblasts cultured, for 3 weeks, with vitamin D 3 and vitamin K 2 were exposed to PENT, a well-known advanced glycoxidation end product for the last 72 hours. Experiments with PENT alone were also carried out. Gene expression of specific markers of bone osteoblast maturation [alkaline phosphatase, ALP; collagen I, COL Iα 1; and osteocalcin (bone-Gla-protein) BGP] was measured, together with the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand/osteoproteregin (RANKL/OPG) ratio to assess bone remodeling. Expression of RAGE, a well-characterized receptor of AGEs, was also assessed. PENT+vitamins slightly inhibited ALP secretion while not affecting gene expression, indicating hampered osteoblast functional activity. PENT+vitamins up-regulated collagen gene expression, while protein secretion was unchanged. Intracellular collagen levels were partially decreased, and a significant reduction in BGP gene expression and intracellular protein concentration were both reported after PENT exposure. The RANKL/OPG ratio was increased, favouring bone reabsorption. RAGE gene expression significantly decreased. These results were confirmed by a lower mineralization rate. We provided in vitro evidence that glycoxidation might interfere with the maturation of osteoblasts, leading to morphological modifications, <b>cellular</b> <b>malfunctioning,</b> and inhibition of the calcification process. However, these processes may be all partially counterbalanced by vitamins D 3 and K 2. Therefore, detrimental AGE accumulation in bone might be attenuated and/or reversed by the presence or supplementation of vitamins D 3 and K 2...|$|R
40|$|Most cells {{throughout}} their existence are constantly subjected to {{enormous amounts of}} endogenous and exogenous DNA damage. The cellular response to genotoxic stressors ultimately either leads to adaptive processes that mediate cellular repair and allow for continuous cellular function or leads to cell malfunction and death. In some theories of aging this <b>cellular</b> <b>malfunction</b> is due to accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage which over time leads to progressive deterioration of tissue/organ homoeostasis and function resulting in organismal aging. The overall goal of my studies is to understand the responses to DNA damage in corneal endothelial (CE) cells whose pump and barrier functions are essential for corneal transparency and which in vivo display age-related degeneration and accumulation of DNA damage. In three complementary and related studies I have focused on how the CE is affected by genotoxic stress. In the first study I have examined the clinical application of the DNA crosslinking agent mitomycin C during photorefractive keratectomy and documented its effects on the CE such as significant accumulation of DNA lesions and elevated levels of apoptosis. In the second study I have examined the long term consequences resulting from failure to repair endogenous DNA damage in vivo. Using a DNA repair-deficient mouse strain I have observed significant premature age-related dystrophic changes in the CE that only occur in very old mice. This suggests that the CE is sensitive and vulnerable {{to the effects of}} accumulating endogenous genotoxic stress and that DNA damage may drive CE aging. In the third study I have examined how CE cell-cell communication mediated by gap junctions is affected by acute genotoxic stress. Given that gap junction intercellular communication is essential for homeostasis and associated with cell proliferation, death and survival, alterations in the gap junction protein connexin- 43 may be crucial for CE cell function and viability during genotoxic stress. The key findings of all my studies elucidate the role of genotoxic stress in CE aging and identify novel responses to stresses from DNA damage. Through a greater understanding of the responses to these stressors, efforts to preserve and improve CE viability and function can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|Oxidative {{stress can}} be defined as a state of {{disturbance}} in the pro-oxidant/antioxidant balance in favour of the former, leading to potential damage. Processes associated with oxidative stress involve reactive oxygen species and radicals and can result in elevated levels of oxidatively modified or toxic molecules that can cause <b>cellular</b> <b>malfunction,</b> and even cell death. Destruction of membrane lipids, lipid peroxidation, caused by reactive oxygen species and radicals has been coupled to many diseases and also normal ageing. The measurement of low molecular weight biomarkers of oxidative stress present in complex matrices such as brain tissue, plasma, urine or cerebrospinal fluid is a delicate and difficult task and {{there is a need for}} improved analytical tools in this field of research. The major foci of this thesis and the work underlying it are the development of analytical techniques and methods for determining biomarkers for oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. Aspects of particular concern include the effects of sample treatments prior to analysis, evaluation of the developed methods with respect to possible artefacts, and the scope for results to be misinterpreted. The specific research goals and issues addressed are detailed in five papers, which this thesis is based upon. Paper I focuses on malondialdehyde, describing and evaluating two new simplified sample pre-treatment regimes for the determination of malondialdehyde in rat brain tissue by capillary electrophoresis with UV detection. The effects of sample storing and handling are also considered. Paper II describes the synthesis, characterization and implementation of a new internal standard for the determination of malondialdehyde in biological samples using electrophoretic or chromatographic separation techniques. The usefulness of the internal standard is demonstrated in analyses of rat brain tissue samples. Paper III presents a method for the determination of 4 -hydroxynon- 2 -enal in brain tissue from rats employing micellar electrokinetic chromatography separation and laser-induced fluorescence detection. Paper IV is focused on the development of a new methodology for determining the stereoisomeric F 2 -isoprostanes in human urine samples employing chromatographic separation on porous graphitic carbon and detection by electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. The results from this study conflict with the hypothesis that peripheral isoprostanes are elevated in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.

40|$|In the environment, {{to which}} we have adapted and thrive, we are {{constantly}} exposed to reactive molecules {{with the potential to}} cause intracellular damage and <b>cellular</b> <b>malfunction.</b> One of the molecules that is transformed to very reactive free radicals is oxygen that can give rise to a variety of reactive oxygen species formed in close vicinity to sensitive structures in different compartments of the cell. This is a potential threat to cell function and cell survival {{at the same time as}} it gives possibilities for change and evolution in a positive sense over time when it happens at the right time in the right cell. To protect the cell from the constant attacks of free radicals a series of cell defence mechanisms has been developed through evolution. Among them are a number of antioxidants that are either synthesised in the cell or taken up from the food. To persevere the stream of reactive molecules the antioxidants have to be regenerated by renewable redox-reactions. This thesis concerns studies of ubiquinol, the only endogenously produced lipid soluble antioxidant known so far and the enzymes and reactions involved in the regeneration of ubiquinol from its oxidized form, ubiquinone, in extramitochondrial compartments of the cell. We showed that the flavoenzyme lipoamide dehydrogenase could reduce ubiquinone to its reduced form ubiquinol and that the rate of this reaction was elevated 10 -fold when zinc was added to the reaction mixture and when NADPH was used as cofactor. The reduction of ubiquinone by lipoamide dehydrogenase was further characterised and an interesting observation was that the pH-optimum of this reaction was 6 and 5. 5 in the presence and absence of zinc, respectively. The ability to reduce ubiquinone was also studied with another flavoenzyme, thioredoxin reductase, and it was shown that under normal physiological conditions this enzyme has the highest activity of all extramitochondrial enzymes so far studied. We also demonstrated that this reaction was selenium dependent. The regeneration of ubiquinol by cytosolic proteins isolated from both normal rat liver and neoplastic tissue. The reaction rate in the cytosol isolated from neoplastic tissue was increased by 50 % compared to control when NADPH was used as cofactor. It was also demonstrated that 90 % of the activity was in the protein fraction with a molecular weight of above 100 kDa. The properties of the reaction was similar with those of thioredoxin reductase suggesting that this enzyme is the one mainly responsible for the regeneration of ubiquinol in the cytosol. In paper V it was for the first time described that ubiquinone was induced by carbon tetrachloride treatement. In conclusion these findings suggest that the antioxidant ubiquinol, in extramitochondrial compartments, is mainly regenerated by the flavoenzymes thioredoxin reductase and lipoamide dehydrogenase. The reactions responsible for regeneration of antioxidants are of great importance for cell survival and adaptation to environmental stress situations...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{information}} that {{takes care of}} the proper functioning of all cell types that makes up an organism is organized in DNA. This so-called blue print of life is continuously attacked by a variety of genotoxic agents and environmental stresses that can damage the DNA (Figure 1). For instance, ultraviolet radiation (UV) causes helix-distorting lesions, cis-syn-cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine-(6, 4) -pyrimidone products (6 - 4 PPs) (Sancar, 1996). On the other hand, ionizing radiation (IR) can cause formation of single strand breaks (SSBs) and double strand breaks (DSBs) (van Gent et al., 2001). The organism’s own metabolism generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) (including superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals and their numerous subsequent reaction products) lipid peroxidation products, oestrogen metabolites, reactive carbonyl species, endogenous alkylating agents, spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination products (De Bont and van Larebeke, 2004). These result in DNA damages like oxidative DNA lesions, including 8 -oxo- 2 ’-deoxyguanosine (oxodG), thymine glycols, cyclopurines and SSBs and DSBs (Hoeijmakers, 2001). Finally, spontaneous modifications of nucleotides such as hydrolysis leading to abasic sites are common in cells. In total this adds up to 104 - 105 lesions per cell per day (Lindahl, 1993). The consequences of DNA damage can be severe and may lead to <b>cellular</b> <b>malfunctioning</b> caused by hampered transcription and replication, and may result in permanent cell cycle arrest (senescence) or cell death (apoptosis). If the cells don’t get replaced, and the tissue or organismal homeostasis gets lost, it can result in (premature) ageing (Mitchell et al., 2003). However, when these DNA damages result in irreversible mutations or chromosomal aberrations, and therefore replication errors, these mutations can lead to carcinogenesis (Mitchell et al., A complex network of DNA repair pathways (first found in bacteria and yeast), each selective for a specific subset of DNA lesions has evolved to overcome early onset of cancer or ageing.

The composition of heterotrimeric PP 2 A holoenzymes, resulting from the combinatorial assembly of a catalytic C, structural A and regulatory B-type subunit, provides the essential determinants for substrate specificity, subcellular targeting and fine-tuning of phosphatase activity, largely explaining why PP 2 A is functionally involved in so many diverse physiological processes, sometimes in seemingly opposing ways. In this review, we highlight how PP 2 A holoenzyme biogenesis and enzymatic activity are controlled by a sophisticatedly coordinated network of five PP 2 A modulators, consisting of α 4, PTPA, LCMT 1, PME- 1 and potentially TIPRL 1, which serve to prevent promiscuous phosphatase activity until the holoenzyme is completely assembled.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{known for a long time}} that the {{cytosine}} base can be modified to produce a new nucleotide, identified as 5 -methylcytosine (mC). In normal cells, mC is correctly distributed into the genome, but in many diseases including life-threatening cancers, its pattern is profoundly perturbed. In 2009, Anjana Rao, published that certain proteins, known as the TET enzymes, are capable of removing mC by further oxidizing it to 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC). This original article, cited more than 1200 times, has led to a great expansion in our understanding of DNA methylation. Such recent publications expanded this knowledge by showing that the TETs successively oxidize hmC to 5 -formylcytosine (fC) and 5 -carboxylcytosine (caC). These oxidized methylcytosines have been implicated in several mechanisms of DNA demethylation, including “active” demethylation through base excision repair, and “passive” demethylation via successive rounds of DNA replication. In addition, DNA hydroxymethylation is thought to be involved in a wide range of diseases, and a marked decrease of hmC seems to be a “hallmark” of many cancers. However, little is known about the regulation of their modes of action. It is tempting to speculate that these proteins interact with a plethora of factors to elicit coordinated biological functions. Likewise, they might be regulated by environment, which in certain situations, could alter the hydroxymethylome landscape, and lead to <b>cellular</b> <b>malfunction</b> and diseases. In the first study, we pursued a large, unbiased screen of the TET interactome, and discovered that TET 2 and TET 3 interact with the O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT). OGT is a glycosyltransferase that adds N-acetylglucose moieties on various proteins, including histone H 2 B, expanding therefore the “histone code”. We further discovered that the TET-OGT association seems to enhance OGT activity and to potentiate glycosylation and stabilization of SET 1 /COMPASS, a complex that is responsible for the global deposition of the H 3 K 4 me 3 histone mark that “decorates” active promoters. Finally, we could confirm a decreased genome-wide H 3 K 4 me 3 deposition in a model of acute myeloid leukemia mutated for TET 2, suggesting that the TET-OGT link is implicated in Health and Disease. In the second study, we looked at the impact of the environment on TET activity and on cellular hydroxymethylomes. We focused on oxidative stress assaults that are known to be involved in inflammation, a mediator of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. We observed a significant decrease of hmC in cell lines treated with various oxidant stressors, likely due to a direct inactivation of the TETs catalytic domain. Moreover, gene ontology analysis of differentially hydroxymethylated regions (dhMRs), profiled by deep-sequencing on treated vs non-treated cells, highlighted pathways involved in oxidative stress response. The implication of TETs in oxidative stress response was further emphasized by a decreased proliferation of TET 1 -depleted cells when they are treated with oxidant stressors. Importantly, those results were confirmed in mice knockout for the major antioxidant enzymes GPx 1 and GPx 2. In conclusion, the work of this thesis contributed to better understand the modes of action of the TET proteins, through (1) direct interaction with OGT, and (2) via direct regulation by oxidative-stress-associated molecules, and we hope that these results will bring new insights to better understand these fascinating enzymes.

40|$|Continuous {{turnover}} of intracellular components by autophagy {{is necessary to}} preserve cellular homeostasis in all tissues. Alterations in macroautophagy, main responsible for bulk autophagic degradation, have been proposed to contribute to pathogenesis in Huntington’s disease (HD), a genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded polyglutamine tract in huntingtin protein. However, the precise mechanism behind macroautophagy malfunctioning in HD is poorly understood. In this work, using cellular and mouse models of HD and cells from HD patients, we have identified a primary defect {{in the ability of}} autophagic vacuoles to recognize cytosolic cargo in HD cells. Autophagic vacuoles form at normal or even enhanced rates in HD cells and are adequately eliminated by lysosomes, but they fail to efficiently trap cytosolic cargo in their lumen. We propose that inefficient engulfment of cytosolic components by autophagosomes is responsible for their slower turnover, functional decay and accumulation inside HD cells.

40|$|Abstract Background Inorganic {{polyphosphate}} (polyP), a polymer of tens or {{hundreds of}} phosphate residues linked by ATP-like bonds, is found in all organisms and performs {{a wide variety of}} functions. PolyP is synthesized in bacterial cells by the actions of polyphosphate kinases (PPK 1 and PPK 2) and degraded by exopolyphosphatase (PPX). Bacterial cells with polyP deficiencies due to knocking out the ppk 1 gene are affected in many structural and important cellular functions such as motility, quorum sensing, biofilm formation and virulence among others. The cause of this pleiotropy is not entirely understood. Results The overexpression of exopolyphosphatase in bacteria mimicked some pleitropic defects found in ppk 1 mutants. By using this approach we found new structural and functional defects in the polyP-accumulating bacteria Pseudomonas sp. B 4, which are most likely due to differences in the polyP-removal strategy. Colony morphology phenotype, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure changes and <b>cellular</b> division <b>malfunction</b> were observed. Finally, we used comparative proteomics in order to elucidate the cellular adjustments that occurred during polyP deficiency in this bacterium and found some clues that helped to understand the structural and functional defects observed. Conclusions The results obtained suggest that during polyP deficiency energy metabolism and particularly nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) formation were affected and that bacterial cells overcame this problem by increasing the flux of energy-generating metabolic pathways such as tricarboxilic acid (TCA) cycle, β-oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation and by reducing energy-consuming ones such as active transporters and amino acid biosynthesis.

Adult T-cell leukemia, which can result from infection with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV- 1), is associated with extensive genomic instability that {{has been attributed to}} the viral oncoprotein Tax. How Tax influences cellular responses to DNA damage to mediate genomic instability, however, remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effect of Tax on cellular pathways involved in recognition and repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Premature attenuation of ATM kinase activity and reduced association of MDC 1 with repair foci were observed in Tax-expressing cells. Following ionizing radiation-induced S-phase checkpoint activation, Tax-expressing cells progressed more rapidly than non-Tax-expressing cells toward DNA replication. These results demonstrate that Tax expression may allow premature DNA replication in the presence of genomic lesions. Attempts to replicate in the presence of these lesions would result in gradual accumulation of mutations, leading to genome instability and cellular transformation...|$|R

40|$|Mitochondrial {{proteins}} {{are predominantly}} encoded in the nucleus and post-translationally imported into the organelle. The translocase {{of the outer}} mitochondrial membrane (TOM complex) mediates protein transport across the outer membrane. Transport across the inner membrane requires one of two translocases in the inner membrane (TIM complexes). A subset of the mitochondrial proteome however is encoded on mitochondrial DNA. These proteins are co-translationally exported across the inner membrane by Oxa 1 and assemble with newly imported proteins into membrane protein complexes of the respiratory chain. In order to maintain mitochondrial function, the assembly of respiratory chain complexes from imported and mitochondria-encoded subunits has to be tightly regulated in order to adapted to <b>cellular</b> requirements. However, <b>malfunction</b> of these regulatory processes is linked to human disorders. To understand such regulatory processes, we {{have focused on the}} cytochrome c oxidase assembly process.

Apart from their central role as chaperones in protecting cells during stressful conditions (as outlined in the previous two chapters), small Hsps also function to maintain cellular homeostasis in physiological conditions. Correct protein refolding to avoid aggregation, targeting misfolded proteins for degradation, proper cytoskeletal organization, and anti-apoptotic functions {{are some of the}} extensively studied attributes of small Hsps. One or more of these <b>cellular</b> mechanisms may <b>malfunction</b> in specific sets of neurons leading to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, polyglutamine disorders, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Many in vitro models of these diseases have demonstrated the beneficial roles of small Hsps pointing out their protective role in attenuating the neurodegenerative phenotype. Interestingly, mutations in small Hsps themselves were linked to other degenerative disorders like inherited peripheral neuropathies and familial myopathies. Although not much is known regarding the exact patho-mechanism (“loss of function” or “gain of function”) of mutations in causing disease, these discoveries reiterate the importance of small Hsps in maintaining neuronal health and indicate that the small Hsp family of proteins might have more functions than meets the eye. This chapter reviews the current knowledge regarding these enigmatic proteins, including their structure and function and how mutations in these once “forgotten proteins” might alter their functions and cause neurodegeneration. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} few years, {{a great deal of}} {{interest}} has risen concerning the applications of stochastic methods to several biochemical and biological phenomena. Phenomena like gene expression, cellular memory, bet-hedging strategy in bacterial growth and many others, cannot be described by continuous stochastic models due to their intrinsic discreteness and randomness. In this thesis I have used the Chemical Master Equation (CME) technique to modelize some feedback cycles and analyzing their properties, including experimental data. In {{the first part of this}} work, the effect of stochastic stability is discussed on a toy model of the genetic switch that triggers the <b>cellular</b> division, which <b>malfunctioning</b> is known to be one of the hallmarks of cancer. The second system I have worked on is the so-called futile cycle, a closed cycle of two enzymatic reactions that adds and removes a chemical compound, called phosphate group, to a specific substrate. I have thus investigated how adding noise to the enzyme (that is usually in the order of few hundred molecules) modifies the probability of observing a specific number of phosphorylated substrate molecules, and confirmed theoretical predictions with numerical simulations. In the third part the results of the study of a chain of multiple phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles will be presented. We will discuss an approximation method for the exact solution in the bidimensional case and the relationship that this method has with the thermodynamic properties of the system, which is an open system far from equilibrium.

40|$|Mechanical forces {{generated}} by cells play important functional roles within many physiological {{systems such as}} regulating local vascular resistance, producing cardiac contractions, and propelling intestinal contents. As a result, a multitude of disorders can be caused directly by <b>malfunctioning</b> <b>cellular</b> force generation including chronic conditions such as asthma, hypertension, and bowel disease. Such disorders place a significant burden on patient health {{and there is a}} paucity of effective drugs, arguably {{due to a lack of}} adequate tools for evaluating cellular force in research or in early drug discovery. Existing approaches to measure cellular forces have been largely limited to biological research settings. Of these, the most widely used are traction force microscopy (TFM) and elastomeric micropost arrays (EMA). Although both approaches are useful for probing specific sub-cellular forces at low yields (usually 10 s of cells per experiment), they were not intended to be used as high-throughput tools for rapidly conducting extensive pharmacological testing and have not been adopted by pharmaceutical companies for drug discovery. Specific barriers to adoption of such technologies include their relatively low throughput, complex experimental procedures which are difficult to automate, and minimal control over cell morphologies which necessitates intensive, non-trivial data analysis and normalization. Production of these systems and their physical characteristics also complicate or entirely prevent integration with standard SLAS well-plate formats. We developed a high-throughput phenotypic screening platform that met this need by measuring the relative strains induced by the contractile forces {{generated by}} up to 105 single-cells adhered to large arrays of elastomeric surface sensors. The method supports analysis of a variety of force-generating behaviors in both a standalone and the multiwell formats used for drug-discovery. This dissertation describes the fabrication of these novel substrates, provides several use-cases including studies of smooth muscle or cardiac muscle force biology at the single-cell level, and provides novel biological data regarding the phagocytic forces of individual human macrophages. We conclude by demonstrating the integration of the platform into standard 96 - and 384 -wellplates and verify its feasibility as a drug discovery tool by performing a pilot high-throughput screen to identifying potential bronchodilatory compounds for asthma management.

40|$|Eukaryotes have {{developed}} evolutionarily conserved mechanisms {{to respond to}} diverse ranges of internal and external perturbations e. g., changes in oxygen/nutrient levels, temperature oscillations, protein folding load, viral/bacterial attacks and graft implants. Alterations and malfunctions within these core regulatory architectures provide a peek into shifts towards cancerous and disease states. These core architectures include signal integrators and actuators, positive and negative feedback mechanisms which mediate the effectiveness and ultimate outcome of the response. Contemporary modeling approaches {{in the era of}} genomics revolution and high-throughput technology presents a unique systems level insight into many areas of biology, ecology, developmental biology and immunology. In my research, I have used a combination of bottom-up analysis (signaling networks based analysis) and a top-down analysis (using microarray/high throughput experimental data) to investigate stress responses in eukaryotes. Using the bottom-up analysis scheme, we assembled a series of molecular modules describing different aspects of the cellular response to stress. Some of these modules included the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), Hypoxic Response (HR) and Tumor Angiogenesis, Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), Translation Initiation and Renal Allograft Failure. These modules were modeled using mass action kinetics with an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) based framework to investigate the internal regula- tory cores. For example, in UPR we identified the differential negative feedback of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF 4) as the key in the adaptation phase via regulation of binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP). Similarly in HR, we identified the role of activator protein 1 (AP 1) in mediating the autocrine response via vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin 8 (IL 8) signaling modules. Model generation was done using UNIVERSAL, an in house software freely available at google code. We addressed issues pertaining to uncertainties within these models by developing POETs, a multi-objective optimizing algorithm which allowed us to train our models with experimental data from the literature. POETs presented us with an advantage by generating an ensemble of models consistent with experimental data. The diversity within these ensembles were used to study different operational paradigms within these modules. For example, in EMT we identified the differential modes of crosstalk between mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and SMADs in mediating the cellular transformation. These different modes of operation suggest insights into different diseases and irregularities in cellular adaptation. We subsequently analyzed these models using parameter independent structural analysis tools like extreme pathways and parameter dependent tools such as fragility and robustness to identify targets relevant to therapeutic interventions. These configurations represent experimentally testable hypothesis and potentially new strategies to manipulate the cellular responses. At an intermediate (length-scale) level, we developed multiscale modeling strategies by inductively extrapolating the consequences of cell signaling to tissue/organ function. We employed this (signaling assisted multiscale modeling (SAMM)) strategy to investigate tumor growth and angiogenesis. Using a top down strategy, we used microarray datasets to investigate <b>cellular</b> signaling, identify <b>malfunctions</b> and create predictive models to infer patient outcome in case of hypoxia induced tumor growth and angiogenesis...|$|R

However, in long-term responses to low VPD, adaptation processes occur which make stomata less sensitive to stimuli which usually induce stomatal closure (stomatal <b>malfunctioning).</b> <b>Cellular</b> mechanism(s) leading to occurrence of stomatal malfunctioning is (are) still unknown. The aim of this project was to elucidate the processes that are involved in the malfunctioning of stomata after long-term exposure to low VPD. To elucidate whether the problem of stomatal malfunctioning is due to alterations in stomatal morphology and leaf anatomy or in the ABA signalling pathway, fava bean plants were grown at low or moderate VPDs and some plants that developed their leaves at moderate VPD were then transferred for four days to low VPD. Leaf anatomical and stomatal morphological alterations due to low VPD were not the main reason of stomatal malfunctioning in response to ABA and desiccation. Within one day exposure to low VPD, the level of foliar ABA decreased to the same level as in low VPD-grown plants, while the level of ABA-glucose ester was not affected. Spraying ABA during a 4 -day exposure to low VPD maintained closing ability of the stomata after 4 -day low VPD-exposure. Therefore, alteration in the signalling pathways due to low foliar ABA level was recognized as the main reason for stomatal malfunctioning after long-term low VPD-exposure. Coincidence in changes of Ca 2 +, ABA receptors, and positive and negative regulators of ABA signalling are proposed as early steps for stomatal malfunctioning induced by low VPD-exposure. Transcriptional activators, transcriptional repressors as well as E 3 ligases are proposed for long-term adaptation of cellular processes which consequently cause decreased stomatal response to closing stimuli afterwards. In order to find the molecular mechanism(s) of stomatal malfunctioning, possible variation in stomatal response to closing stimuli was studied among Arabidopsis thaliana accessions after a 4 -day low VPD-exposure. Accessions could be grouped to very sensitive, moderately sensitive and less sensitive to closing stimuli using principle component analysis. A positive correlation was found between foliar ABA level (before desiccation) and stomatal closure response to ABA (but not to desiccation) after exposure to different VPDs. Stomatal response to desiccation was positively correlated with the foliar ABA level after desiccation. In order to elucidate the molecular network underlying stomatal malfunctioning in response to ABA due to long-term low VPD-exposure, two groups of Arabidopsis accessions were used as accessions that maintained responsiveness to ABA after low VPD-exposure and accessions with low VPD induced non-ABA-responsive stomata. The foliar ABA content in all accessions correlated with the stomatal response to ABA: only when the ABA level was above a threshold value, stomata responded to ABA. After low VPD-exposure, mainly due to catabolism of ABA, the foliar ABA content decreased. This decrease in ABA level resulted in down regulation of RD 29 A, which caused decreased stomatal responsiveness to ABA.  ...|$|R
