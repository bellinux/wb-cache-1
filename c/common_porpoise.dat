6000|$|BOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER III. (Mealy-mouthed Porpoise).--The largest kind of Porpoise; {{and only}} {{found in the}} Pacific, {{so far as it}} is known. The only English name, by which he has {{hitherto}} been designated, is that of the fisher--Right-Whale Porpoise, from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In shape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a less rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and gentleman-like figure. He has no fins on his back (most other porpoises have), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all. Though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark in a ship's hull, called the [...] "bright waist," [...] that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two separate colors, black above and white below. The white comprises part of his head, and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look {{as if he had just}} escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag. A most mean and mealy aspect! His oil is much like that of the <b>common</b> <b>porpoise.</b>|$|E
60|$|BOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER 1. (Huzza Porpoise).--This is the <b>common</b> <b>porpoise</b> found {{almost all}} over the globe. The name is of my own bestowal; for {{there are more than}} one sort of porpoises, and {{something}} must be done to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of fine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward. They are the lads that always live before the wind. They are accounted a lucky omen. If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye. A well-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil. But the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in request among jewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones. Porpoise meat is good eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him; and you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.|$|E

5000|$|The English word {{porpoise}} {{comes from}} the French pourpois (Old French porpais, 12th century), which is from Medieval Latin porcopiscus, which is a compound of porcus (pig) and piscus (fish). The old word is probably a loan-translation of a Germanic word, compare Danish marsvin and Middle Dutch mereswijn (sea swine). Classical Latin had a similar name, porculus marinus, and the notion behind the name is probably a fancied resemblance of the snout {{to that of a}} pig or the sound of a porpoise breathing resembling a pig snort. The species is sometimes known as the <b>common</b> <b>porpoise</b> in texts originating in the United Kingdom. It is also called a [...] "puffer" [...] or [...] "puffing pig" [...] by fishermen in New England and eastern Canada. [...] The species' taxonomic name, Phocaena phocaena, is the Latinized form of the Greek φώκαινα, phōkaina, [...] "big seal", as described by Aristotle; this from φώκη, phōkē, [...] "seal".|$|E

The {{arterial}} and venal system as found in the kidneys of the dog are present in the kidneys of the <b>Common</b> <b>Porpoise</b> without typical differences {{but there is also a}} venal system situated outside the renculi which conducts the blood from the venae arcutae to the vene cava. This system is found in the kidneys of the Common Seal but here it is replacing the system of the vena renalis which it does not do in the kidneys of the <b>Common</b> <b>Porpoise.</b> In the kidneys of the <b>Common</b> <b>Porpoise</b> and the Fin Whale both the plexus which surround the pelvic cavity and the ureter are present and they show to be nearly similar to those described for the kidneys of the dog. Between the renculi it is found that the plexus mentioned are somewhat more developed than in the dog. The morphology of the plexus is also identical to that of the plexus in the dog, and it is supposed that their function will be also the same in the <b>Common</b> <b>Porpoise</b> and in the dog...|$|E

50|$|Most {{photographs}} of Burmeister's porpoises are taken of dead specimens {{and show the}} animal to be coloured black. This phenomenon {{gave rise to the}} earlier <b>common</b> name, black <b>porpoise.</b> However live individuals are typically a dark grey color. They turn black {{in just a few minutes}} after death. The underside varies in colour but is usually a lighter grey. Burmeister's are about 150 cm long when fully mature and weigh 50 - 75 kg. The maximum recorded weight is that of a female at 105 kg. They have a shallow indentation at their blowhole set just in front of the eyes. The shape and placement of the dorsal fin is unusual for a cetacean - it is triangular rather than curved and points backwards more than upwards. It is located about three quarters of the way along the back - further back than any other dolphin or porpoise. These features are sufficient to distinguish the porpoise from the similar-sized Chilean dolphin which is found in the porpoise's Pacific range.|$|R
40|$|The {{content of}} polychiorinated {{hydrocarbons}} (PCHC) (mainly pesticides and their metabolites) and polychiorinated biphenyls (PCB) were assayed in fat tissue specimens of hunting animals, {{shot on the}} southwest coast of Greenland, and in Eskimoes of the same area. Among the birds highest amounts of pp'DDE and PCB {{were found in the}} cormorant and the raven (high amounts of PCB were also found in the Brün-nich's Guillemot), pp'DDT and pp'DDP were not traced. Among the mammals shot the polar bear contained highest amounts of PCB, but also the <b>common</b> <b>porpoise</b> showed high values. Great individual variations, however, occurred.

40|$|S a warm-blooded animal, a whale must {{be adapted}} {{not only to}} prevent an {{excessive}} loss of heat but also to control {{the rate of heat}} loss in relation to changes in its metabolic activity and in the temperature of its sur-roundings. This paper contains an account of whale blubber considered from this point of view. The first part is devoted to the morphology of blubber, particular attention being paid to the blood circulation which {{does not appear to have}} been previously described; and the second part contains a discussion of the efficacy of blubber as a thermal insulator of controllable conductance. The results are based on a study of the <b>Common</b> <b>Porpoise</b> (Phocaena phocaena), and the Blue and Fin Whales (Balaenoptera musculus and B. physalus). The term 'blubber ' is in popular and commercial use to denote the super-ficial tissues of whales and seals, which form, a compact layer loosely fastened to the underlying muscle and easily stripped off for commercial purposes. Blubber comprises the animal's epidermis, dermis, and hypodermal tissues; and in the following account the word will always be used in this sense. The term 'integument ' is used to refer to these tissues in other mammals...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of our {{investigation}} on the stomach contents of 148 animals and the gonad of 103 animals from among many DALL'S porpoises which had been caught by the Japanese salmon fishing gill nets in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific Ocean in 1964 and 1965, the following characteristics have been ascertained. The sampling period in each year lasted for three months from the latter part of May to the first part of August. 1) The stomach contents of infant porpoises were their mother's milk in all cases; no other food was found; and there was no empty stomach. 2) In this sea area, small marine animals (squid, fish and shrimp) for the food of porpoises were very abundant in this season, but generally the quantity of their stomach contents was not so large. 3) No significant difference was recognized in quantity and kind of stomach contents between male and female, but there was a distinct difference between pregnant and nonpregnant animals. The contents were less in quantity and more polyphagous in the former than in the latter. 4) Squid were very abundant in this sea area in this season, and porpoises ate mostly these squid. Sometimes fish and shrimps were found among the stomach contents but these were very small in quantity in camparison with squid. 5) There was only one sample of red salmon in the investigated stomachs, but it is most likely porpoises do not eat adult salmons as their food. It is not clear whether or not small size salmons in this sea area are caught by porpoises. It is subject to future investigations. 6) As {{a result of}} the investigation in 1965, it was clarified that the period of parturition for the porpoises in this sea area is between the latter part of July and the first part of August. 7) It is presumed that the body length of a baby porpoise at the time of parturition is about 100 cm. 8) It is believed that the pregnant period of porpoises is less than a year. Fetuses were found in the left uterine cornu in all cases. 9) A sexually mature male is 185 cm in body length or more, and three years or more in age. 10) Any perfectly ripe testis was not found in this investigation in spite of many large male samples. It is deemed that the time of copulation came after the period of this investigation. This is also evident from the result of the investigation of the ovaries. There was no difference in weight between the left and right testes. 11) There was no difference in size between the left and right ovaries in the stage of fetus, but since childhood, the left ovary became larger than the other. Ovulation from the left ovary was observed in all cases (83 cases) {{with the exception of one}} case. The right ovary was immature in those 83 cases. 12) The corpus luteum projected to the outside of the overy and the size was four or five times as large as that of the ovary. 13) The corpus luteum of ovulation (corpus luteum menstruationis) was not found in this season. This is on account of the fact that the period of this investigation did not fall on the pairing-time of this species. This is also evident from the observation of hystological ovarian sections. 14) With this species, too, the corpus luteum fade away quickly into the ovary when its function terminates and becomes the corpus albicans, but it seems that the corpus albicans in the ovary of this species does not disappear for their whole life as in the case of large whales. 15) Most of the females reach sexual maturity after two full years since their birth. The body length at that time is about 170 cm. 16) Most of the vesicular follicles do not ovulate but fade away, and on account of the increase in cells of the follicular epithelium, the liquor folliculi disappears and the follicle becomes hyaline and then disappears. 17) The lutein cells in the corpus luteum disappear quickly after the parturition. 18) The growth curve of DALL'S porpoises drawn from their body length and body weight (Fig. 6) which had been investigated in 1964 and 1965, is shown in Fig. 7. 19) One individual of <b>common</b> <b>porpoise</b> and one individual of BAIRD'S beaked whale were caught by the salmon fishing gill nets in addition to DALL'S porpoises in the season of 1965, and they were investigated. 1964 年, 1965 年の両年北洋母船式鮭鱒漁業の流し網にかかった多くのDALL'S porpoiseのうち, 148 頭について胃内容の, 103 頭について生殖巣の調査を行なった結果,次のことが明らかになった. 期間は 5 月下旬から 8 月上旬の 3 ヵ月間である. 1) 稚体の胃内容は総て乳液であり,他の餌は全く発見できなかった. また,空胃は存在しなかった. 2) 本海域はこの時期には餌料生物が非常に豊富であるにもかかわらず,一般に胃内容量は少ない. 3) 雌雄による胃内容の量および種類の差は認められないが,妊娠獣と非妊娠獣では明らかな差があり,前者の方が量は少なく雑食性である. 4) 本海域のこの時期ではイカ類が頗る豊富で本種の主食になっている. 胃内容にはこの他にエビ類・雑魚も発見されるが,これらはイカ類に比べて量的に極めて少ない. 5) ベニザケを摂食していた事例が一つあったが,本種は成長した鮭鱒に対して殆んど食害を与えていないと推定される. 小型の鮭鱒に対する食害については不明であり,今後の調査に待ちたい. 6) 本海域における本種の分娩時期は 7 月下旬より 8 月上旬にかけてである. 7) 本種の分娩体長は 100 cm前後と推定された. 8) 妊娠期間は 1 年未満と推察される. 胎児はすべて左側の子宮角から発見された. 9) 本種の雄の性的成熟体長は 185 cm以上であり,満 3 才以上である. 10) 本調査時期中には完熟精巣は全く発見されず,交尾の時期はこの調査時以後に到来するものと思われる. これは卵巣の調査からもいえる. 精巣では左右による重量(成熟度) の差は見られない. 11) 卵巣の大きさは胎児の時は左右の差はないが,幼体以降においては左側の方が他よりも大である. また排卵は 1 例を除いて総て(83 例) 左側の卵巣より行なっていた. 右側の卵巣は未成熟の状態である. 12) 本種の黄体は卵巣外に突出し,その大きさは卵巣の 4 ～ 5 倍である. 13) 本漁期中には単なる排卵の黄体は全く発見されていない. これはこの漁期が本種﻿交尾の時期以外であるためである. このことは組織学的調査による卵巣の状態からもいえる. 14) 黄体はその機能が終れば急速に卵巣中に収縮して白体となるが,しかし,本種の白体は消失しない. 15) 本種の雌の性的成熟は大部分は生後満 2 年経過した後である. そしてその時の体長は約 170 cmである. 16) 卵巣中の胞状卵胞は殆んどがその機能を果さずに収縮する. すなわち卵胞萎縮である. そして卵胞膜細胞の増殖侵入によって卵胞液が消失し,硝子様帯となってその姿を消す. 17) 黄体細胞は分娩後始めて急速に消失する. 18) 漁期中測定した本種の体長・体重(Fig. 6) より成長曲線を描くとFig. 7 のごとくなる. 19) 漁期中,鮭鱒流し網には本種の他に小型歯鯨類はネズミイルカ 1 頭・槌鯨 1 頭が網にかかり調査された...|$|E

The results of a shipboard line-transect survey conducted in July-November 1991 (“summer”) were compared to those from aerial line-transect surveys conducted in March-April 1991 and February-April 1992 (“winter”). Using a confidence-interval-based bootstrap procedure, abundance estimates for six of the eleven species included in the comparison exhibited significant (a = 0. 05) differences between the winter and summer surveys. Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens), Risso’s dolphins (Grampus griseus), common dolphins (Delphinus spp.), and northern right whale dolphins (Lissodelphis borealis) were significantly more abundant in winter. The abundance of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculuss) and gray whales (Eschrichtius vobwtus) reflected well-documented migratory patterns. Fin whales (B. physalus) were significantly more abundant during summer. No significant differences in seasonal abundance were identified for Dall’s porpoises (Phocoenoides dalli), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), killer whales (Orcinw orca), sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), or humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae).

40|$|The Yangtze finless {{porpoise}} (Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaorientalis), {{is a small}} freshwater cetacean which has recently fallen dramatically in number. It is an endemic species for the Yangtze River and unless drastic action is taken, it risks the same fate as the now functionally extinct Yangtze river dolphin (Lipotes vexillifer). Threats to the porpoise are diverse but {{they have in common}} that they are caused by man. Development of the river has been made to supply a growing human population with food, hydropower, and {{to reduce the risk of}} flooding. These changes have resulted in a degraded habitat for the porpoise. A major problem is that the species natural behaviour and morphological adaptions to a life in a river exposes it to serious risks. Porpoises navigate by echolocalization and have poorly developed eyes due to the turbid water in the river. Today this navigation is made difficult by the heavy vessels trafficing the Yangtze River. It is <b>common</b> that <b>porpoises</b> collide with vessels which lead to injuries and even death. Another behaviour that causes problems is that the porpoise hunt near the river bottom. This is the area where fishermen lay down most of their fishing gear. This increases the risk that they will get entangled which ultimately leads to their death. Measures have been taken to try to save the species. Conservation work is conducted in captivity, ex situ and in situ. Ex situ work takes place largely in the restored oxbow lake Tian’e-Zhou where porpoises breed naturally in an environment with reduced fishing and vessel traffic. The in-situ work is performed in established reserves in the main river. In captivity, the porpoises reproduce successfully and behavioural research can be conducted on them. However, it is important to work towards a restoration of a decent living environment in the Yangtze River since in-situ conservation should be the goal of all conservation work. The Yangtze River is such an important resource for the local people, and the species living in and around it that a big effort should be applied to preserve it. It seems that the re-creation of oxbow lakes has favored the species and establishment of more of these semi-natural reserves would therefore be of further benefit. Even so, this alone will not suffice to ensure the porpoise future. In order to give the species a fair chance of survival, efforts from many directions is required. Industry, government, local people and not least consumers across the world must pull together to restore the Yangtze River, thus giving the Yangtze {{finless porpoise}} a chance to survive...|$|R
40|$|Understanding spatial {{physical}} habitat selection {{driven by}} competition and/or predator–prey interactions of mobile marine species {{is a fundamental}} goal of spatial ecology. However, spatial counts or density data for highly mobile animals often (1) include excess zeros, (2) have spatial correlation, and (3) have highly nonlinear relationships with physical habitat variables, which results in the need for complex joint spatial models. In this paper, we test the use of Bayesian hierarchical hurdle and zero-inflated joint models with integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA), to fit complex joint models to spatial patterns of eight mobile marine species (grey seal, harbor seal, harbor <b>porpoise,</b> <b>common</b> guillemot, black-legged kittiwake, northern gannet, herring, and sandeels). For each joint model, we specified nonlinear smoothed effect of physical habitat covariates and selected either competing species or predator–prey interactions. Out {{of a range of}} six ecologically important physical and biologic variables that are predicted to change with climate change and large-scale energy extraction, we identified the most important habitat variables for each species and present the relationships between these bio/physical variables and species distributions. In particular, we found that net primary production {{played a significant role in}} determining habitat preferences of all the selected mobile marine species. We have shown that the INLA method is well-suited for modeling spatially correlated data with excessive zeros and is an efficient approach to fit complex joint spatial models with nonlinear effects of covariates. Our approach has demonstrated its ability to define joint habitat selection for both competing and prey–predator species that can be relevant to numerous issues in the management and conservation of mobile marine species...|$|R
40|$|Cetacean {{distribution}} and abundance within Irish waters is poorly known, especially offshore. The present thesis {{focuses on the}} use of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) during offshore surveys in Irish waters, in order to acquire a better understanding on habitat choice and abundance of odontocetes in offshore Irish waters. By using a towed hydrophone array, diagnostic whistles, clicks and burst pulsed sounds from odontocetes were recorded during 79 days spent at sea. A total of 6 species were identified using the manual method of analysis of the audio files, consisting in the identification of vocalizations from spectrograms by eye while simultaneously listening to acoustic files using spectrograms. The manual method proved to be very powerful in detecting vocalizations from Sperm whale, Long finned pilot whale and Harbor <b>porpoise.</b> <b>Common</b> dolphin, Bottlenose dolphin and Northern bottlenose whale could not be identified directly using only vocalizations, but the simultaneous associated sighting of the animals was needed to confirm the species identification. With the exception of the Harbor porpoise, which seems to be confined to shallow waters, and the Common dolphin, which was encountered almost everywhere, the other species identified were encountered mainly on steep depth gradients along the shelf edge, suggesting this area to be an important habitat for most of the odontocetes likely to be encountered in Irish waters. In the last years attempts have been made in order to develop automated software able to identify cetacean vocalizations automatically. The efficacy of click and whistles identification using the automated methods of analyses was evaluated by comparing the performances of the automated software PAMGUARD to those of the manual method of analysis. The results show that, in order to correctly identify clicks, PAMGUARD should be always used in conjunction with the manual method of analysis. The manual method, although requiring much more time than the automated method, seems to be the only system able to identify whistles with fair accuracy...|$|R

Utilizing fingerprinting and standard biotyping techniques, it was possible to differentiate RB 51 from other brucellae and to ascertain the stability of RB 51. Standardization of a genomic fingerprinting procedure using restriction endonuclease profiles of total DNA from Brucella are described. Although the focus was principally on B. abortus isolates from cattle, the investigation included field isolates from bison and elk, reference strains, vaccinal strains, and genetically-engineered brucellae;Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles of the reference type strains allowed separation of the strains to the level of species. A unique fingerprint relative to other brucellae was discovered for RB 51, using profiles of genomic DNA digested with the restriction endonuclease Xba I;Stability of RB 51 after animal passage and high passage on artificial media was determined using standard methods for characterizing brucellae. Techniques included biochemical, morphological, antigenic, phage susceptibility, and antibiotic resistance. RB 51 retained rough colonial morphology with no detectable O-antigen of Brucella lipopolysaccharide and remained resistant to rifampin or to penicillin and sensitive to tetracycline following repeated passage. No detectable changes in characteristic oxidative metabolic profiles on selected amino-acid or carbohydrate substrates were demonstrated following in vivo or repeated in vitro passage;Genomic fingerprints of reference strains and biovars of Brucella were analyzed to obtain information on the genetic relatedness among the strains.
