5000|$|In formal terms, a {{glycoside}} is any molecule {{in which}} a sugar group is bonded through its anomeric carbon to another group via a glycosidic bond. Glycosides can be linked by an O- (an O-glycoside), N- (a glycosylamine), S-(a thioglycoside), or C- (a <b>C-glycoside)</b> glycosidic bond. According to the IUPAC, the name [...] "C-glycoside" [...] is a misnomer; the preferred term is [...] "C-glycosyl compound". [...] The given definition is the one used by IUPAC, which recommends the Haworth projection to correctly assign stereochemical configurations. Many authors require in addition that the sugar be bonded to a non-sugar for the molecule to qualify as a glycoside, thus excluding polysaccharides. The sugar group is then known as the glycone and the non-sugar group as the aglycone or genin part of the glycoside. The glycone can consist of a single sugar group (monosaccharide) or several sugar groups (oligosaccharide).|$|E

These closely related lectins share a specificity for the trimannoside methyl 3, 6 -di-O-(R-D-mannopyranosyl) -R-D-mannopyranoside, and are a useful model system for addressing the feasibility of differentiating between lectins with overlapping carbohydrate specificities. The ligands were designed to address two issues: (1) how the recognition properties of non-hydrolyzable <b>C-glycoside</b> analogues compare with those of the corresponding O-glycosides and (2) the effect of presentation of more than one saccharide recognition epitope on both affinity and specificity.

Methanolic extracts from peel and the fruit juice of P. tripartita growing in Chile were analyzed for antioxidant capacity {{as well as}} for flavonoid and phenolic content. A chromatographic method was developed for the rapid identification of the main phenolics in the samples by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS. The fast fingerprint analysis allowed the detection of eighteen flavonoid <b>C-glycosides</b> and four flavonoid O-glycoside derivatives which were characterized by UV spectra and ESI-MS-MS analysis. Several of the <b>C-glycosides</b> detected are structurally related to the orientin derivative 4 ′-methoxy-luteolin- 8 -C-(6 ″acetyl) -b-D-glucopyranoside (31), fully elucidated by spectroscopic methods. The antioxidant derivative 31 along with schaftoside, vicenin II, orientin and vitexin were isolated from the fruit extract by high-speed countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC). A suitable method for the preparative isolation of flavonol <b>C-glycosides</b> from “tumbo” extracts by HSCCC is reported. The pulp of the fruits showed good antioxidant capacity (12. 89 ± 0. 02 mg/mL in the DPPH assay). The peel presented the highest content of flavonoids (56. 03 ± 4. 34 mg quercetin/ 100 g dry weight) which is related to the highest antioxidant power (10. 41 ± 0. 01 mg/mL in the DPPH assay) ...|$|R
