The organic vehicle was formed from suspending ethyl <b>cellulose</b> <b>resins</b> into terpineol solvent in a specific ratio. The paste was printing onto ceramic substrate by using DEK J 1202 thick film screen printer machine. The recipe and the process in producing BaTiO 3 thick film paste was then established. The electrical properties of screen-printed BaTiO 3 were investigated in an interdigitated electrode pattern. Experimental results show that the smaller gap between two adjacent electrodes gives higher capacitance and lower resistance value, thus provide better response time in detecting capacitor changes for sensor application.

40|$|Thin {{organic and}} polymer layers on solid {{substrates}} {{play a key}} role in many processes aimed at modifying surface properties. Both "grafting to" and "grafting from" methods have been used in this project to modify a variety of surfaces including <b>cellulose,</b> <b>resins</b> and carbon nanotubes (CNT) with functional polymers. Living radical polymerisation and Huisgen [2 + 3] cycloaddition (often termed "click" reaction) were used to carry out these modifications. Living radical polymerisation was first used to synthesize different α-functional polymers and used for surface modification. For example, Living radical polymerisations of methyl methacrylate and a fluorescent comonomer with 2 -bromo- 2 -methyl-propionic acid 3 -azido-propyl ester and 2 -bromo- 2 -methyl-hept- 6 -yn- 3 -one as initiators have been successfully employed for the synthesis of fluorescently tagged azide and alkyne terminated PMMA with molecular weight (Mn) close to that predicted and polydispersity index (PDi) less than 1. 20 and good first order kinetics that would be expected for living radical polymerisation. Cotton and organic resin surfaces have been functionalised with alkyne groups using simple condensation with 4 -chlorocarbonyl-butyric acid prop- 2 -ynyl ester. The surfaces have been further modifies using a Huisgen [2 + 3] cycloaddition (click) reaction of both polymeric and small molecule azides. Different functional azides, namely mono azido-PEG and a new fluorescent hostasol derivative have also been prepared and tested as model substrates for cotton surface modification. This approach is shown to be very general allowing soft and hard surfaces with different geometries to be modified. In particular it is an excellent method to alter the nature of organic resins allowing the incorporation of many different functionalities. The covalent immobilization of a range of carbohydrate derivatives onto resin beads was then carried out. Copper-catalysed Huisgen [2 + 3] cycloaddition was used to graft mannose-containing azides to complementarily functionalised alkyne surfaces, namely: a) Wang resin or b) "Rasta" particles consisting of a "clickable" alkyne polymer loose outer shell and a Wang resin inner core. For the second approach, Wang resin beads were first converted into immobilized ATRP initiators, and then polymerisation of trimethylsilanyl-protected propargyl methacrylate followed by deprotection with TBAF· 3 H 2 O afforded the desired polyalkyne clickable scaffold. An appropriated α-mannopyranoside azide was then clicked onto it, to give a mannose functionalized "Rasta" resin. The binding abilities of these D-mannose-modified particles were then tested using fluorescein labelled Concanavalin A (Con A), a lectin known for its ability of binding certain mannose-containing molecules. Our preliminary results indicated that the novel glycohybrid materials presented in this work are able to efficiently recognize mannose-binding model lectins such as Con A, opening the way for their potential application in affinity chromatography, sensors and other protein recognition/separation fields. Other functional polymers with antibiotic or chiral properties were also grafted from surfaces. Living radical polymerisation of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) and a metronidazole monomer (MTD-MA) has been successfully employed for the synthesis of antibiotic metronidazole containing polymers with Mn close to that predicted, narrow polydispersity and good first order kinetics that would be expected for living radical polymerisation. Using the monomers PEGMA and MTD-MA, with preformed immobilized initiator on cotton, surface initiated LRP was carried out to give cotton bearing antibiotic polymers. Surface initiated living radical polymerisation of GMA was then successfully carried out for the synthesis of PGMA containing bead base on Aquagel resin. The hydroxyl groups of the PGMA moiety were then reacted with a single enantiomer (R) -(+) - 1 - phenylethyl isocyanate (EtPhNCO). This demonstrates a convenient way of immobilise enantiomer moiety onto resin surface and the resulting solid support may be used as chiral stationary phases (CSP) for HPLC chromatography. To modify CNTs with functional polymers not only increase the dispersability of the CNTs, it has also enlarged the application areas of CNT’s due to the polymers' own functional properties. MWCNTs were first converted to a solid support LRP initiator by an esterification reaction and styrene was grafted from MWCNTs through surfaceinitiated LRP, the PSt modified CNTs were then used to form isoporous membranes. Similarly, Poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrons were covalently attached to MWCNTs and dendron-MWCNT-Ag(0) hybrid materials were made afterwards which occurred via Ag(I) coordination to the PAMAM dendron nitrogen donors, followed by reduction with formaldehyde. Finally, noncovalent method was used to make a thermo-sensitive water soluble CNTs. The homopolymerisations and copolymerisation of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) and di(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (DEGMA) using a pyrene-containing initiator and a Cu(0) /Me 6 -Tren catalyst system was investigated. The pyrenefunctionalised polymers synthesised were then used to modify CNTs and thus thermosensitive water-dispersible CNTs were made.

40|$|Silicon carbide (SiC) {{materials}} are prime candidates for high temperature heat exchangers for next generation nuclear reactors {{due to their}} refractory nature and high thermal conductivity at elevated temperatures. This {{research has focused on}} demonstrating the potential of liquid silicon infiltration (LSI) for making SiC to achieve this goal. The major advantage of this method over other ceramic processing techniques is the enhanced capability of making high dense, high purity SiC materials in complex net shapes. For successful formation of net shape SiC using LSI techniques, the carbon preform reactivity and pore structure must be controlled to allow the complete infiltration of the porous carbon structure which allows complete conversion of the carbon to SiC. We have established a procedure for achieving desirable carbon properties by using carbon precursors consisting of two readily available high purity organic materials, crystalline <b>cellulose</b> and phenolic <b>resin.</b> Phenolic resin yields a glassy carbon with low chemical reactivity and porosity while the cellulose carbon is highly reactive and porous. By adjusting the ratio of these two materials in the precursor mixtures, the properties of the carbons produced can be controlled. We have identified the most favorable carbon precursor composition to be a <b>cellulose</b> <b>resin</b> mass ratio of 6 : 4 for LSI formation of SiC. The optimum reaction conditions are a temperature of 1800 C, a pressure of 0. 5 Torr of argon, and a time of 120 minutes. The fully dense net shape SiC material produced has a density of 2. 96 g cm{sup - 3 } (about 92 % of pure SiC) and a SiC volume fraction of over 0. 82. Kinetics of the LSI SiC formation process was studied by optical microscopy and quantitative digital image analysis. This study identified six reaction stages and provided important understanding of the process. Although the thermal conductivity of pure SiC at elevated temperatures is very high, thermal conductivities of most commercial SiC {{materials are}} much lower due to phonon scattering by impurities (e. g., sintering aids located at the grain boundaries of these materials). The thermal conductivity of our SiC was determined using the laser flash method and it is 214 W/mK at 373 K and 64 W/mK at 1273 K. These values are very close to those of pure SiC and are much higher than those of SiC materials made by industrial processes. This SiC made by our LSI process meets the thermal properties required for use in high temperature heat exchanger. <b>Cellulose</b> and phenolic <b>resin</b> carbons lack the well-defined atomic structures associated with common carbon allotropes. Atomic-scale structure was studied using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), nitrogen gas adsorption and helium gas pycnometry. These studies revealed that cellulose carbon exhibits a very high degree of atomic disorder and angstrom-scale porosity. It has a density of only 93 % of that of pure graphite, with primarily sp 2 bonding character and a low concentration of graphene clusters. Phenolic resin carbon shows more structural order and substantially less angstrom-scale porosity. Its density is 98 % of that of pure graphite, and Fourier transform analysis of its TEM micrographs has revealed high concentrations of sp 3 diamond and sp 2 graphene nano-clusters. This {{is the first time that}} diamond nano-clusters have been observed in carbons produced from phenolic resin. AC and DC electrical measurements were made to follow the thermal conversion of microcrystalline cellulose to carbon. This study identifies five regions of electrical conductivity that can be directly correlated to the chemical decomposition and microstructural evolution during carbonization. In Region I, a decrease in overall AC conductivity occurs due to the initial loss of the polar groups from cellulose molecules. In Region II, the AC conductivity starts to increase with heat treatment temperature due to the formation and growth of conducting carbon clusters. In Region III, a further increase of AC conductivity with increasing heat treatment temperature is observed. In addition, the AC conductivity demonstrates a non-linear frequency dependency due to electron hopping, interfacial polarization, and onset of a percolation threshold. In Region IV, the DC conductivity continues to increase with heat treatment due to the growth and percolation of carbon clusters. Finally in Region V, the DC conductivity reaches a plateau with increasing heat treatment temperature as the system reaches a fully percolated state. Thermophysical properties of carbon materials derived from microcrystalline cellulose have been measured under vacuum and compared with earlier measurements conducted under nitrogen to better understand the influence of porosity, composition, and atmosphere effects. The effective thermal conductivity in vacuum is lower than that observed in nitrogen primarily due to the conductivity of nitrogen gas...|$|R
40|$|The studies {{reported}} in this thesis describe the use of Perloza™ beaded <b>cellulose</b> <b>resin</b> as a solid support for enzyme immobilisation via covalent binding. The aim {{of the project was}} to extend the uses for Perloza™ and to compare the use of well known solid support activation chemistries with a recently developed one for Perloza™. Preparations such as these have potential industrial uses. Three attachment chemistries were studied. The first activation employed 1, 1 -carbodiimidazole (CDI) then direct attachment of enzyme. The second again used CDI activation followed by attachment of a 6 -aminocaproic acid spacer arm and then the enzyme. The final method used was attachment of a diol and subsequent oxidation to an aldehyde. The diol/aldehyde method had the advantage over the CDI methods of being based on aqueous chemistries. The two CDI based methods require extensive use of dry organic solvents. The enzymes investigated in this study were trypsin, chymotrypsin. α-amylase, horseradish peroxidase (HRPO) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Trypsin was immobilised successtully by all three chemistries. All preparations retained significant activity after immobilisation at room temperature as judged by the chromogenic substrate specific for trypsin N-α-benzoyl-DL-arginine-p-nitroanilide. HC 1 (BAPNA). Measurable activity was retained in different studies from between 2 to 7 days at 60 °C. The activity of immobilised trypsin with a synthetic peptide substrate was comparable to the activity of free trypsin with the same substrate. Chymotrypsin was also successfully immobilised using all three chemistries. Each preparation showed significant retention of activity after immobilisation as judged by the chromogentic substrate N-glutaryl-L. -phenylalanine-p-nitroanilide (GAPNA). Stabilisation to heating at 60 °C was less successful than with trypsin but significant activity was still retained for between 3 and 6 hours. The activity of immobilised preparations with a peptide substrate was comparable to free chymotrypsin. α-Amylase, horseradish peroxidase and alcohol dehydrogenase were studied less extensively than trypsin and chymotrypsin. Nevertheless all three enzymes were successfully immobilised onto Perloza™-CDI-ACA and Perloza™-Diol/Aldehyde. Difficulty was encountered in achieving significant levels of any enzyme immobilisation to Perloza™-CDI for all three enzymes. Subsequent activity assays showed HRPO and α-amylase retained significant activity on all three resin preparations. ADH showed no measurable activity on Perloza™-CDI and very little activity on Perloza™- CDI-ACA and Perloza™-Diol/Aldehyde. Investigations have shown that enzymes can be immobilised on Perloza™ with retention of significant amounts of normal activity at room temperature and improved stability compared with free enzyme at high temperature. Comparisons of the CDI activations with the diol/aldeyde chemistry showed better performance by the latter in trypsin immobilisation and similar performance for chymotrypsin immobilisation. Horseradish peroxidase and ™-amylase were successfully immobilised using CDI/ACA and diol/aldehyde chemistries with the CDI/ACA giving higher initial specific activities than the diol/aldehyde preparation. Alcohol dehydrogenase was also successfully immobilised but gave no measurable activity...|$|R

Composites reinforcement was in a form of fiber rovings and fabrics to manufacture uni-directional and cross-ply laminates. Water absorption experiments were performed at different humidity levels to measure apparent diffusion coefficient and moisture content at saturation. Effect of chemical treatment (alkali and silane) on fibers as protection against moisture was also subjected to study. The comparison of results for pristine resins and composites showed that primarily cellulosic reinforcement is responsible for moisture uptake in composites. However, fiber treatment did not improve moisture resistance in composites significantly. Mechanical testing {{was carried out in}} order to estimate the influence of humidity on behavior of these materials. Results were compared with data for glass fiber and epoxy, as reference materials.

40|$|As {{part of the}} postclosure safety {{assessment}} of Ontario Power Generation’s (OPG’s) proposed Deep Geologic Repository (DGR) for Low and Intermediate Level Waste (L&ILW) at the Bruce site, Ontario, a Gas Generation Model (GGM) has been developed and used to model the detailed generation of gas within the DGR due to corrosion and microbial degradation of the organics and metals present. The GGM {{is based on a}} kinetic description of the various microbial and corrosion processes that lead to the generation and consumption of various gases. It takes into account the mass-balance equations for each of the species included in the model, including three forms of organic waste (<b>cellulose,</b> ionexchange <b>resins,</b> and plastics and rubbers), four metallic waste forms and container materials (carbon and galvanised steel, passivated carbon steel, stainless steel and nickel-based alloys, and zirconium alloys), six gases (CO 2, N 2, O 2, H 2, H 2 S, and CH 4), five terminal electron acceptors (O 2, NO 3 -, Fe(III), SO 4 2 -, and CO 2), five forms of biomass (aerobes, denitrifiers, iron reducers, sulphate reducers, and methanogens), four types of corrosion product (FeOOH, FeCO 3, Fe 3 O 4, and FeS), and water. The code includes the possibility of the limitation of both microbial and corrosion reactions by the availability of water. The GGM has been coupled with TOUGH 2 to produce T 2 GGM; a code that models the generation of gas in the repository and its subsequent transport through the geosphere. T 2 GGM estimates the peak repository pressure, long time repository saturation and the total flux of gases from the geosphere. The present paper describes the development of T 2 GGM and the numerical modelling work undertaken to calculate the generation and build-up of gas in the repository, the two-phase exchange of gas and groundwater between the repository and the surrounding rock, and between the rock and the surface environment. The results have been used to inform the {{safety assessment}} modelling...|$|R
50|$|The use {{of paper}} board as {{electrical}} insulation paper {{started in the}} early-mid 20th century. Since the need for high voltage electrical transformers, {{there has been a}} need for an insulating material that could withstand the high electrical and physical stresses experienced around a core and windings. Pressboard, a board made by compressing layers of paper together and drying them, has been used for installation purposes in many of the first electrical machines. However, as electrical technology increased, the need for a higher density material that was capable of insulating larger and higher voltage transformers grew. In the late 1920s, Hans Tschudi-Faude became the director of H. Weidmann Limited and began developing a type of pressboard that would meet the higher standards needed for the newer, more powerful transformers. Unlike older methods of pressboard production, Transformerboard was not based on used paper or cotton waste but was made with high-grade sulfate cellulose. The new product was made purely out of <b>cellulose</b> without a <b>resin</b> or binder, improving electrical insulation capabilities and could be completely dried, degassed, and oil impregnated. The new product became famous under the name Transformerboard. Throughout the 1930s, new methods of production and advances in understanding replaced almost all insulating parts of transformers with parts made from transformer board.|$|R
40|$|Adenovirus type 5 E 1 A {{proteins}} {{interact with}} cellular regulators of transcription to reprogram gene {{expression in the}} infected or transformed cell. Although E 1 A also interacts with DNA directly in vitro, {{it is not clear}} how this relates to its function in vivo. The N-terminal conserved regions 1, 2 and 3 and the C-terminal portions of E 1 A were prepared as purified recombinant proteins and analyses showed that only the C-terminal region bound DNA in vitro. Deletion of E 1 A amino acids 201 – 220 inhibited binding and a minimal fragment encompassing amino acids 201 – 218 of E 1 A was sufficient for binding single- and double-stranded DNA. This portion of E 1 A also bound the cation-exchange <b>resins</b> <b>cellulose</b> phosphate and carboxymethyl Sepharose. As this region contains six basic amino acids, in vitro binding of E 1 A to DNA probably results from an ionic interaction with the phosphodiester backbone of DNA. Studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have shown that expression of a strong transcriptional activation domain fused to a DNA-binding domain can inhibit growth. Although fusion of the C-terminal region of E 1 A to a strong transcriptional activation domain inhibited growth when expressed in yeast, this was not mediated by the DNA-binding domain identified in vitro. These data suggest that E 1 A does not bind DNA in vivo...|$|R
40|$|The {{preparation}} and characterisation of novel, high efficiency chelating sorbents which were {{suitable for the}} preconcentration and separation of trace metals from complex matrices using a single column has been described. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates {{in the form of}} <b>cellulose</b> and polystyrene <b>resins</b> were modified with chelating dyes by either covalent bonding or physical adsorption respectively. Large particle size polystyrene resins were used for preliminary investigations of dye loading and metal retaining capacities. After crushing resins to an intermediate particle size, capacity factors (k' values) and metal retaining capacities of four resins were determined. One resin, MN 200, was chosen for further investigations after crushing to a small particle size. A study of analytical separations and selectivities on the small particle size dye impregnated MN 200, for a range of dyes, was used to determine the suitability for analytical and preparative applications. The selectivity and separating ability of the unmodified resin was also investigated. Three specific preparative and analytical applications were chosen which would exploit the metal separating capabilities of the modified or unmodified resins. The first of these studies was applied to the isolation of strontium from calcium, rubidium and barium in gypsum samples. The second involved the separation and determination of trace bismuth in lead and the third described the separation and determination of thorium and uranium from a complex metal containing matrix...|$|R
40|$|Porous {{materials}} are usually heterogeneous both structurally and energetically. Activated carbon fibres (ACFs) are relatively novel fibrous adsorbents produced for example from pith, <b>cellulose,</b> lignocellulose, phenol <b>resin</b> and polyacrylonityile (Peebles, 1995; Ryu, 1999). ACFs show important advantages {{with respect to}} conventional activated carbons. Among these advantages {{it is worth noting}} their high adsorption capacity and easiness to handle. Their main inconvenience lays on the difficulty of choosing adequate activating agents and activation conditions that are required {{in order to maintain the}} fibrous morphology. The adsorption capacity of ACFs depends on many factors, such as raw materials, activation process, pore structure and surface functionalities (Suffet, 1981; Park, 1999). Surface roughness is an important factor that influences the adsorption properties of an activated carbon. Fractal dimension is a measure of roughness of a surface. The use of the fractal concept is becoming very popular as a tool to characterize the texture of complex materials, such as porous solids. The fractal properties of these porous systems were determined by means of several techniques such as gas adsorption, mercury porosimetry and Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS and SANS). Kenaf is an herbaceous annual plant that belongs to the family of Malvaceae. Kenaf possesses both, long and short fibre. The aim of this work is to study the influence of the preparation conditions on the fractal dimension and porous texture of ACFs prepared from long fibres of kenaf by physical activation using carbon dioxide as activating agent. * Autho...|$|R
40|$|O presente trabalho teve como objetivo estudar a influência dos créditos de carbono na viabilidade financeira de três projetos florestais. Os projetos analisados foram: heveicultura, eucalipto e pinus para produção de borracha, celulose e resina, respectivamente. O Valor Presente Líquido (VPL), a Taxa Interna de Retorno (TIR), o Valor Esperado da Terra (VET) e o Valor Anual Equivalente (VAE) foram os indicadores utilizados na avaliação financeira, a uma taxa de desconto de 10 % ao ano. Os resultados deste trabalho indicaram que, com esta taxa, os projetos de eucalipto e pinus foram viáveis sem os recursos adicionais dos CERs (Certificados de Emissões Reduzidas), ressaltando-se que a inclusão dos créditos de carbono propiciou aumento da viabilidade financeira destes. Já o projeto da heveicultura mostrou-se viável apenas com os Certificados de Carbono. A receita advinda da venda dos CERs aumentou consideravelmente a viabilidade financeira dos três projetos, mesmo considerando a tonelada de CO 2 a US$ 3, 00. Caso o Protocolo de Kyoto seja ratificado, haverá um incremento no preço pago pela tonelada de CO 2, que ocasionará o aumento da contribuição dos CERs em projetos florestais. The {{objective}} of the present work was to study the influence of carbon credits on the financial viability of three forest projects. The analyzed projects were: heveiculture, eucalyptus and pinus for production of natural rubber, <b>cellulose</b> and <b>resin,</b> respectively. The Net Present Value (NPV), the Internal Return Rate (IRR), the Soil Expected Value (SEV) and the Equivalent Annual Value (EAV) were the indicators used in the financial evaluation, using a discount rate of 10 % a year. The results of this work demonstrated that with this rate, the projects of eucalyptus and pinus were viable without additional resources from the CERs (Certificates of Emissions Reduced), and {{the inclusion of the}} carbon credits induced an increase in their financial viability. The heveiculture project was shown to be viable only with the Certificates of Carbon. The income coming from the sale of CERs increased the financial viability of the three projects considerably, even considering the CO 2 ton at US$ 3, 00. In case of ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, there will be an increment in the price paid for ton of CO 2, which in turn will increase the contribution of CERs in forest projects...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Organic {{solvents}} are chemically different compounds {{with one}} common feature: they dissolve fats, oils, <b>resins,</b> <b>cellulose</b> acetate and cellulose nitrate, {{which makes them}} widely used in industry. Most often organic solvents are used in paint and lacquer industries, in production of pesticides, plastics, explosives, rubber, cellulose, air conditioners, in pharmaceutical industry and in leather industry. The aim {{of this research was}} to analyze the working environment and professional hazards in paint and lacquer manufacturing industry and evaluate effects of chronic exposure to mixture of organic solvents on nervous system of exposed workers. Methodology The exposed group consisted of 50 workers professionally exposed to these noxae, while the control group consisted of 30 workers who have never been exposed to these noxae. Results Examination of working environment in departments of paint and lacquer manufacturing revealed presence of white spirit and toluene above allowed levels. Exposed workers more frequently complained of fatigue, hand numbness, enhanced excitation, and concentration difficulties, forgetfulness and headaches, than workers from the control group. Electroneurographic examination of n. medianus showed reduced motor and sensitive conduction velocity among exposed in comparison to workers from the control group. Reduced motor and sensitive conduction velocity was correlated with duration of exposure to these noxae. Terminal latency of n. medianus was statistically, significantly longer in the exposed group than in the control group. Workers in the exposed group have statistically significantly longer reaction time in response to acoustic and visual stimuli. Discussion Segmental demyelination and axonal degeneration, as forms of damage to peripheral nerves, were identified as responsible for peripheral neuropathy associated with occupational exposure to organic solvents. Conclusion Results of this study show possible neurotoxic effects of noxae detected in the phase of analysis of working conditions and working environment of examined workers...|$|R
