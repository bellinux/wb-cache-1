Enemy asteroids can be {{attacked}} using ships, missiles and agents. During a battle, laser beams <b>criss-cross</b> the screen and buildings catch fire before being destroyed. Ground turrets fire back at attacking ships and anti-missile turrets shoot out incoming missiles.|$|E

It bears a hieroglyphic text that is woven into a <b>criss-cross</b> mat design to form a convoluted puzzle that must be read in precisely the right order to be understood.|$|E
40|$|The {{study focused}} on an {{alternative}} device for landslide mitigation which {{is the use of}} <b>criss-crossed</b> plastic bottles. Two phases of test was done with the study, first test was simulation of rainfall in the tilting soil bed without <b>criss-crossed</b> bottles and second with the <b>criss-crossed</b> bottles. Further, the angles of inclination for the tilting soil bed were 30 degrees and 35 degrees for the two phases of test. Rainfall was simulated on the bed for 15 minutes, and every 5 minutes soil and water collected through a basin was measured and recorded. The study showed the capability of <b>criss-crossed</b> bottles in handling soil erosion by use of tilting soil bed. The data gathered from the tests showed that the <b>criss-crossed</b> bottles are more effective at 30 degrees inclination. The device helps in capturing water and soil that flows through it during rainfall which is proven by the difference of volume of water runoff with and without bottles...|$|R

5|$|Tech led 6–3 when Strupper {{broke the}} game {{open in the}} second half. After a fumble by Strupper, Hill caught a pass from the 22-yard line and ran in for a {{touchdown}}. Strupper made the next touchdown after Tech ran through Davidson's right guard. Strupper then recovered a punt fumbled by Flowers on Davidson's 30-yard line, leading to a score by Hill from 18 yards out on a <b>criss-cross</b> run. Davidson scored its only touchdown on a forward pass. From midfield, quarterback Henry Spann hit end Georgie King on a 50-yard touchdown pass that went 30 yards in the air, catching Tech by surprise. For Tech's last score, Judy Harlan returned an interception 40 yards for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|The {{prominent}} markings that <b>criss-cross</b> {{the moon}} {{seem to be}} mainly albedo features, which emphasize low topography. There are few craters on Europa because its surface is tectonically active and young. Some theories suggest that Jupiter's gravity is causing these markings, as one side of Europa is constantly facing Jupiter. Also, volcanic water eruptions splitting the surface of Europa, and even geysers have been considered as a cause. The color of the markings, reddish-brown, is theorized {{to be caused by}} sulfur, but scientists cannot confirm that, because no data collection devices have been sent to Europa. Europa is primarily made of silicate rock and likely has an iron core. It has a tenuous atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the main}} {{doors of the}} Main Stand is a wood-panelled hallway. A {{staircase}} leads to the boardroom and trophy room. Inglis compared Ibrox to Highbury, in that it combined corporate power {{with a sense of}} tradition and solidity. It was originally constructed as a 10,000-seat stand above a standing enclosure. It was redeveloped in the early 1990s with the addition of the Club Deck and seating in the enclosure. It is now a three-tier all-seated structure, accommodating approximately 21,000 spectators. The front wall of the middle tier {{is one of the last}} surviving examples of the Leitch style of <b>criss-cross</b> detailing. The middle tier is split into front and rear sections, while the enclosure is split into east and west sections, either side of the retractable tunnel cover.|$|E
