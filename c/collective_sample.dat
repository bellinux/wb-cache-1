In this study I therefore attempted to obtain some clarity in this matter. Faeces samples were collected from sheep kept in herded herd. In 78 of those samples, worm eggs were counted with the McMaster method {{as well as the}} CSF method. Paired results were plotted against each other and a correlation coefficient of 0, 5173 (P< 0, 001) was found. A side study was also done to gain some insight on the species of worm present in these herded herds. For this study a <b>collective</b> <b>sample</b> from each herd was put away in a glass jar for 10 days to grow larvae. Larvae were identified per species under the microscope. The distribution of species was displayed {{as a percentage of the}} total. The results mainly corresponded with the expectation in which season, age of the sheep etc. were taken into account...|$|E

Using 2 -D parametric modeling, we find that the morphology of RGG 118 is best described by an outer spiral disk, inner component consistent with a pseudobulge, and central PSF. The luminosity of the PSF is consistent with the central point source being dominated by the AGN. We measure the luminosity and mass of the "pseudobulge" and confirm that the central black hole in RGG 118 is under-massive with respect to the M_BH-M_ bulge and M_BH-L_ bulge relations. This result is consistent with a picture in which black holes in disk-dominated galaxies grow primarily through secular processes.

The present study aimed to investigate trends in overweight and obesity in Irish adults between 1990 and 2011. Anthropometric data from three Irish national food consumption surveys were used to calculate trends in BMI, waist circumference and waist:hip ratio. Three cross-sectional food consumption surveys: the Irish National Nutrition Survey (1990), the North/South Ireland Food Consumption Survey (2001) and the National Adult Nutrition Survey (2011). A <b>collective</b> <b>sample</b> of free-living Irish adults (n 3125), aged 18 – 64 years. There were significant increases in mean weight, height and BMI from 1990 to 2011. Significant increments were also reported in waist and hip circumferences and waist:hip ratio between 2001 and 2011, with concurrent increases {{in the proportion of}} individuals at risk of developing CVD, particularly females aged 18 – 35 years. In 2011, 23 · 4 % of the Irish population was classified as obese; with the mean BMI increasing by 1 · 1 kg/m 2 between 1990 and 2001 and by 0 · 6 kg/m 2 between 2001 and 2011. The present paper characterises obesity levels in Irish adults from 1990 to 2011. Absolute levels of overweight and obesity have increased between these time points. Of concern is the increase in the proportion of young women classified as at risk of CVD, using waist circumference and waist:hip ratio.

Inspired by the approach used in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, we brought together investigators representing seven cohorts with a <b>collective</b> <b>sample</b> size of N = 1147 that included detailed information on trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, and genome-wide DNA methylation data.

We propose methods to deal with ancestry population stratification and type I error inflation and discuss {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} applying robust error estimates. To evaluate our pipeline, we report results from an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of age, which is a well-characterized phenotype with known epigenetic associations. Overall, while EWAS are highly complex and subject to similar challenges as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we demonstrate that an epigenetic meta-analysis with a relatively modest sample size can be well-powered to identify epigenetic associations.

40|$|Background: Inadequate sleep {{duration}} is {{a significant}} risk factor for obesity in children. However, the mechanism by which poor sleep increases the risk for obesity in childhood is unclear. It is hypothesized that sleep {{may be linked to}} obesity via alterations in key lifestyle practices. Objectives: This systematic review aims to investigate whether an association exists, in either direction, between poor sleep quantity/ quality and: a) poor dietary intake/behaviors; b) sub-optimal physical activity and sedentary behavior patterns, in children and adolescents aged 3 - 18 years. Inclusion criteria: Studies were eligible for inclusion if participants were healthy and aged 3 - 18 years. Studies were excluded if the population had known co-morbidities. Exposure variables were sleep quantity/ quality and physical activity/ dietary intake. Both directions of the association were considered. Study types: The review considered any epidemiological study design, if they assessed the association between sleep quantity/ quality and dietary patterns or physical activity/ sedentary behavior. Outcomes: Outcome measures were dietary intake and physical activity/ sedentary behavior (after exposure to poor sleep quantity/quality) and sleep quantity/ quality (after exposure to poor dietary behavior or sub-optimal physical activity/ sedentary behavior). Search strategy: The search strategy aimed to find both published and unpublished studies in the English language from January 1970 to March 2011. Electronic databases included PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, online Australian Digital Theses Program and Dissertation Abstracts, and Mednar. Methodological quality: Critical appraisal was undertaken by two independent reviewers using the standardized critical appraisal instrument from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instruments. Data collection/ synthesis: Using the appropriate Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument, information was extracted including population demographics; method of sleep, dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary activity collection; sleep quantity/ quality, dietary intake, physical activity/ sedentary behavior findings. Data from included studies were presented in tables and as a narrative summary. Results: Of a total of 414 studies identified, seven cross-sectional studies met the inclusion criteria and underwent critical appraisal and data extraction. Included studies had a <b>collective</b> <b>sample</b> size of n= 8849, evenly distributed male: female ratio, and age range 7 - 15 years. Five studies reported activity and sleep-related outcomes and five reported dietary and sleep-related outcomes. The majority of studies used subjective assessment of outcomes. Several studies reported reduced sleep duration and insomnia symptoms and associations with dietary patterns, physical activity, and sedentary behavior. Conclusions: To investigate how poor sleep quantity/ quality may increase obesity risk in children and adolescents, well-designed longitudinal and intervention studies to explore the direction of the association between childhood sleep and dietary/ activity practices are needed...|$|E
40|$|Supply chain {{strategy}} is {{widely recognized as}} {{a crucial part of}} an organizational strategy. Supply chain strategy, organizational functions related to supply chain partners and performance are important issues in supply chain management research. However, the foundation of various aspects of supply chain strategy, such as quality focus and innovation focus, and their relationships with functions of supply chain partners is less known. Similarly, the structure encompassing the supply chain strategy, organizational objectives and functions, and various organizational performance measures requires a better understanding. This dissertation proposes a macro-structured framework to describe the relationships among organizational supply chain strategy, objectives, internal and external functions, as well as performance 1. The dissertation limits the scope of empirical inquiry to three complementing theoretical themes that stem from the macro research framework. Firstly, the dissertation seeks to establish and validate a theoretical model linking a multi-aspect supply chain strategy construct, core operational functions (such as process management and product development), and organizational performance. Secondly, the dissertation attempts to establish a relationship extending from supply chain strategies (lean and responsive) to supplier functions (supplier quality, cost effectiveness, flexibility, and delivery reliability), which in turn impact buyer performance. Thirdly, the dissertation proposes a model that links innovation-focused supply chain strategy and performance. The third model argues for a positive impact of supply chain innovation strategy on innovative buyer-supplier relationship (covered by the constructs supplier focus, buyer-supplier innovation intent, and buyer supplier innovation structure) leading to enhanced product innovation, which in turn has positive impact on business performance. Additionally, the dissertation seeks to explore the linkages between organizational demographics and product innovation. The dissertation collects empirical data using a literature-based research questionnaire from 191 related managers from Pakistan from various industrial sectors of the sampling frame to investigate the theoretical models. In addition, a data set from 105 companies from various industrial sectors of India boosts the sample size to 296. The dissertation also presents the results of the tests of the hypotheses on a <b>collective</b> <b>sample</b> of 296 companies (191 from Pakistan and 105 from India). The dissertation uses structural equation modeling and hierarchical regression on AMOS (Version 18) and SPSS (Version 19) respectively for the data analyses. The data validates the theoretical basis and usefulness of all the constructs. The empirical tests of hypothesized models show that various supply chain strategy dimensions have overall significant relationships with multiple performance areas through internal operations and supplier functions. Firstly, {{the results of the study}} find a strong positive impact of supply chain strategy on core internal operations, including product development, production technology, process management, customer focus, and use of information technology. Furthermore, the research finds an overall positive impact of supply chain strategy on performance through core operational functions. Secondly, the study finds strong positive impact of supply chain strategy on related supplier functions including supplier cost effectiveness, supplier quality practices, supplier delivery, and supplier flexibility, which in turn have an overall positive impact on multiple performance areas of the buyer. Thirdly, the research establishes that supply chain innovation strategy encourages an innovative buyer-supplier relationship leading to enhanced product innovation and business performance. In addition, the hierarchical regression analysis seeks to find relationships of various organizational demographics, including foreign collaboration, age of company, export orientation, and number of employees with product innovation. The regression analyses run on Pakistani and Indian data sets separately find support for positive relationships of age of company and foreign collaboration with product innovation in both data sets. The Pakistani data set supports a positive relationship of export orientation with product innovation and the Indian data set supports a positive relationship of number of employees with product innovation. Fin ally, both data sets do not find a relationship between company revenue and product innovation. The dissertation discusses theoretical and managerial implications of the findings of each theoretical model. The dissertation improves theoretical understanding and removes managerial ambiguity as to what constitutes supply chain strategy and how it impacts organizational operations both in-house and at the supplier end, which in turn impact performance on multiple fronts. The findings suggest that an alignment of supply chain strategy with internal and supplier functions improves cost, quality, delivery, flexibility, and product innovation outcomes, leading to enhanced buyer performance. Hence, it makes good business sense for managers to align supply chain functions with supply chain strategy for performance improvement. Moreover, the relationship of demographic variables with product innovation provides insights into how the organizational context can nurture product innovation. This dissertation provides a platform for several future research endeavors. For example,the future research can extend the empirical investigation of the three theoretical models presented here in another empirical setting using quantitative or qualitative research approach. Moreover, the future research can empirically investigate the contingency effects of the demographic variables on the hypothesized models presented here. Finally, it would be interesting to proceed with an in-depth analysis of any significant differences between the Pakistani and Indian companies...|$|E

Findings To examine the distribution of random errors (repeatability standard deviation) of the detection procedure, <b>collective</b> <b>samples</b> were taken from two uncontaminated rooms using a sampling vacuum cleaner, and 10 sub-samples each were examined with 3 parallel cultivation plates (DG 18). In this two <b>collective</b> <b>samples</b> of new dust, the total counts of Aspergillus spp. varied moderately by 25 and 29 % (both 9 cfu per plate). At an average of 28 cfu/plate, the total number varied only by 13 %. For the evaluation of the influence of old dust, old and fresh dust samples were examined. In both cases with old dust, the old dust influenced the results indicating false positive results, where hidden moist was indicated but was not present. To quantify the influence of sand and sieving, 13 sites were sampled in parallel using the 63 -μm- and total dust collection approaches. Sieving to 63 -μm resulted in a more then 10 -fold enrichment, due to the different quantity of inert sand in each total dust sample. Conclusion The major errors during the quantitative evaluation from house dust samples for mould fungi as reference values for assessment resulted from missing filtration, contamination with old dust and the massive influence of soil. If the assessment is guided by indicator genera, the percentage standard deviation lies in a moderate range. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Paired with {{satellite}} location telemetry, animal-borne instruments {{can collect}} spatiotemporal data describing the animal’s movement and environment at a scale relevant to its behavior. Ecologists have developed methods for identifying the area(s) used by an animal (e. g., home range) and those used most intensely (utilization distribution) based on location data. However, few have extended these models beyond their traditional roles as descriptive 2 D summaries of point data. Here we demonstrate how the home range method, T-LoCoH, can {{be expanded to}} quantify <b>collective</b> <b>sampling</b> coverage by multiple instrumented animals using grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) equipped with GPS tags and acoustic transceivers on the Scotian Shelf (Atlantic Canada) as a case study. At the individual level, we illustrate how time and space-use metrics quantifying individual sampling coverage {{may be used to}} determine the rate of acoustic transmissions received. Results: Grey seals collectively sampled an area of 11, 308 km² and intensely sampled an area of 31 km² from June-December. The largest area sampled was in July (2094. 56 km²) and the smallest area sampled occurred in August (1259. 80 km²), with changes in sampling coverage observed through time. Conclusions: T-LoCoH provides an effective means to quantify changes in <b>collective</b> <b>sampling</b> effort by multiple instrumented animals and to compare these changes across time. We also illustrate how time and space-use metrics of individual instrumented seal movement calculated using T-LoCoH can be used to account for differences in the amount of time a bioprobe (biological sampling platform) spends in an area. 9 page(s...|$|R

Therefore, the reconstruction method has to cope with two different types of uncertainty; namely, identification of the infected population and the partially unknown sampling procedure. In this work, by using a natural probabilistic model for “viral infections”, we design non-adaptive sampling procedures that allow successful identification of the infected population with overwhelming probability 1 −o(1). We propose both probabilistic and explicit design procedures that require a “small ” number of agents to single out the infected individuals. More precisely, for a contamination probability p, the number of agents required by the probabilistic and explicit designs for identification of up to k infected members is bounded by m = O(k 2 log(n/k) /(1 −p)) and m = O(k 2 log 2 n/(1 − p) 2), respectively.

Furthermore, we show that this gain is obtained without loss of accuracy.

We construct 4 -way tensors (users x keywords x time x servers) and analyze them to show the impact of server and window size selections on the results. ...|$|R

CEP 290 is surprisingly localized at a different axial level bridging the basal body (BB) and other TZ proteins. Upon this molecular architecture, two reservoirs of intraflagellar transport (IFT) particles, correlating with phases of ciliary growth, are present: one colocalized with the transition fibers (TFs) while the other situated beyond the distal edge of the TZ.

Chemical composition of the essential oils of the Portuguese thymes were carried out by means of several analytical methods (GLC, GLC/Ms e " 1 " 3 C-NMR). In order to study infra specific variability chemical analysis were made on <b>collective</b> <b>samples</b> of several populations of the same taxa and on individual samples of the same populations. The results obtained with the analysis of individual plants were submitted to a Principal Component Analysis and a Chemometric Cluster Analysis. It was {{found out that the}} Portuguese thymes have a high degree of chemical polymorphism with several chemical types of essential oils in the majority of the taxa: Th. mastichina (L.) L. sub sp. mastichina (1, 8 -cineole, linalool/ 1, 8 - cineole), Th. albicans Hoffmann. and Link (1, 8 -cineole, linalool, linalool / 1, 8 -cineole), Th. lotocephalus G. Lopez and R. Morales (linalool / #beta# - caryophyllene epoxide / camphor, linalool / 1, 8 -cineole, 1, 8 - cineole, linalyl acetate / linalool / #beta# - caryophyllene epoxide, geranyl acetate / intermedeol), Th. villosus L. sub sp. villous (p -cymene / camphor / linalool, p - cymene / borneol, linalool / geraniol / geranyl acetate, #alpha#-terpineol / camphor / myrcene), Th. villous L. sub sp. lusitanicus (Boiss.)

40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the relationships among}} cohesion and self-efficacy, collective efficacy, perceived efficacy by peers and coaches, expectations of success and <b>collective</b> performance. The <b>sample</b> {{was made up of}} 61 participants belonging to 6 league basketball teams. Different instruments were used to assess cohesion, perceived efficacy and expectations of success. Performance was measured by their final classifications. The results showed a positive relationship between perceived efficacy and the four factors of cohesion, both as regards social and task aspects. Furthermore, players who perceived a higher level of cohesion were associated with participants who perceived higher expectations of success and performed better...|$|R
40|$|The SRAM cell is an {{important}} memory component that is widely used in integrated circuit design. Its performance {{is crucial to the}} entire circuit. However, inevitable process variations have introduced significant changes in the performance of fabricated SRAM cells and led to severe circuit failure. Consequently, the failure probability of an SRAM cell must be kept extremely small. These extremely small probability events are considered to be "rare events". The most straightforward method of estimating failure probability is using the classical Monte Carlo method. However, this method is extremely impractical in the case of rare events because of its drastically long run time. Therefore, a method to efficiently estimate the failure probability of rare events is strongly desired. In this thesis, a novel and fast failure analysis for SRAM cells is proposed to efficiently and accurately estimate the failure probability of a rare event. The proposed approach is based on Probability <b>Collective</b> based Importance <b>Sampling.</b> This approach increases the convergence rate by finding the closest approximation of the optimal distribution used in Importance Sampling. In order to find the closest approximation of the optimal sampling distribution, the proposed method minimizes the Figure of Merit of the estimated probability in each iteration. Experimental results show that the proposed method can have an average of 5 x speed up compared to Probability <b>Collective</b> based Importance <b>Sampling.</b> Moreover, multiple trials between these two methods show that the proposed method offers a faster convergence rate and greater stability...|$|R
