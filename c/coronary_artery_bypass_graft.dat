Revascularization intent determined before random assignment was compared with the revascularization performed. All management followed strict, unbiased, criteria-driven protocols. Patients and nonoperative care providers were blinded to surgical group. Results: Baseline characteristics were similar. The number of grafts performed per patient (mean ± SD 3. 39 ± 1. 04 for off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting,</b> 3. 40 ± 1. 08 for conventional <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting)</b> and the index of completeness of revascularization (number of grafts performed/number of grafts intended, 1. 00 ± 0. 18 for off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting,</b> 1. 01 ± 0. 09 for conventional <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting)</b> were similar. Likewise, the index of completeness of revascularization was similar between groups for the lateral wall. Combined hospital and 30 -day mortalities and stroke rates were similar. Postoperative myocardial serum enzyme measures were significantly lower after off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting,</b> suggesting less myocardial injury. Adjusted postoperative thromboelastogram indices, fibrinogen, international normalized ratio, and platelet levels all showed significantly less coagulopathy after off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting.</b> Patients undergoing off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> received fewer units of blood, were more likely to avoid transfusion altogether, and had a higher hematocrit at discharge. Cardiopulmonary bypass was an independent predictor of transfusion (odds ratio 2. 42, P =. 0073) by multivariate analysis. More patients undergoing off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> were extubated in the operating room and within 4 hours. Postoperative length of stay (in days) was shorter for off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> (5. 1 ± 6. 5 for off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting,</b> 6. 1 ± 8. 2 for conventional <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting,</b> P =. 005 by Wilcoxon test). One patient (in the conventional <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> group) required angioplasty for graft closure within 30 days. Conclusions: When compared with conventional <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> with cardiopulmonary <b>bypass,</b> off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> achieved similar completeness of revascularization, similar in-hospital and 30 -day outcomes, shorter length of stay, reduced transfusion requirement, and less myocardial injury.

40|$|ObjectiveThe optimal timing for <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> after acute {{myocardial}} infarction is not well established. The California Discharge Database facilitates the study of this issue by providing data from a large patient cohort free of institutional bias. We examine the timing of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> after acute {{myocardial infarction}} on short-term outcomes. MethodsWe reviewed California Discharge Data to identify 40, 159 patients who were hospitalized for {{acute myocardial infarction}} (day 0) and underwent subsequent <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting.</b> Patients were stratified by the timing of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> to “early” (days 0 – 2) and “late” groups (day 3 or later). The primary outcome variable was all-cause hospital mortality. Multiple logistic and linear regression and propensity analyses assessed the risk of adverse events, controlling for factors associated with preoperative clinical acuity, including the Charlson Comorbidity Index, shock, mechanical ventilation, {{and the use of}} intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation. ResultsOf 9476 patients identified, 4676 (49 %) were in the early <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> group and 4800 (51 %) were in the late <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> group. A total of 444 patients (4. 7 %) died during hospitalization, with a peak mortality rate of 8. 2 % among patients undergoing <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> on day 0, declining to a nadir of 3. 0 % among patients undergoing <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> on day 3. The mean time to <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> was 3. 2 days. Patients undergoing early <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> experienced a higher mortality rate than those undergoing late <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> (5. 6 % vs 3. 8 %, P <. 001). Early <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> was an independent predictor of mortality after controlling for clinical acuity and on propensity analysis (odds ratio 1. 43, P =. 003). ConclusionPatients undergoing <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> within 2 days of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction experienced higher mortality rates than those undergoing <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> 3 or more days after acute myocardial infarction, independently of clinical acuity.

40|$|ObjectiveThe aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the influence of off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> on early and long-term mortality and morbidity in a consecutive series of elderly patients (aged > 65 years) compared with conventional <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting.</b> MethodsFrom January of 1999 to December of 2003, data were extracted for 1191 patients aged more than 65 years: a conventional <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> group (n = 744) and an off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> group (n = 447). Age-related early outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and postoperative morbidities. Long-term outcomes, including total mortality, repeated revascularization, Q-wave myocardial infarction, stroke, readmission, and the combination of death, Q-wave myocardial infarction, stroke, and repeated revascularization, were evaluated with Cox regression analysis. ResultsUnivariate analysis for early outcomes showed significant benefits from off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting.</b> After adjustment for baseline characteristics, there was still a benefit of off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting.</b> Kaplan–Meier survival analyses (propensity matched cases) showed that stroke, major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, and readmission occurred more frequently in the off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> group (P <. 001). There was a nonsignificant trend to higher total mortality (P =. 193) and higher repeated revascularization rates (P =. 067) in the off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> group. Cox regression for long-term outcomes showed that patients in the off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> group had a higher incidence of stroke (hazard ratio 2. 611, 95 % confidence interval 2. 152 – 3. 070), readmission (hazard ratio 2. 000, 95 % confidence interval 1. 747 – 2. 253), and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (hazard ratio 1. 764, 95 % confidence interval 1. 456 – 2. 072).

MethodsRoutine intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography identified 985 patients undergoing isolated <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> with severe atheromatous disease in the aortic arch or ascending aorta. Off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> was performed in 281 patients (28. 5 %). Propensity matched-pairs analysis was used to match patients undergoing off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> (n = 245) with patients undergoing <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> with cardiopulmonary <b>bypass.</b> ResultsUnivariate analysis revealed decreased hospital mortality (16 / 245, 6. 5 % vs 28 / 245, 11. 4 %; P =. 058) and stroke prevalence (4 / 245, 1. 6 % vs 14 / 245, 5. 7 %; P =. 03) in off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> compared with <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> with cardiopulmonary <b>bypass.</b> Freedom from any postoperative complication was higher in off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> compared with <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> with cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> (226 / 245, 92. 2 % vs 196 / 245, 80. 0 %; P <. 001). Multivariable analysis of preoperative risk factors showed that increased hospital mortality was associated with <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> with cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> (odds ratio = 2. 7; P =. 01), fewer grafts (P =. 05), acute myocardial infarction (odds ratio = 11. 5; P <. 001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (odds ratio = 2. 4; P =. 03), previous cardiac surgery (odds ratio = 10. 2, P =. 05), and peripheral vascular disease (odds ratio = 2. 1; P =. 05). Cardiopulmonary bypass was the only independent risk factor for stroke (odds ratio = 3. 6, P =. 03). At 36 months' follow-up, comparable survival was observed in the off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> and <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> with cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> groups (74 % vs 72 %). Multivariable analysis revealed that renal disease (P <. 001), advanced age (P <. 001), previous myocardial infarction (P =. 03), and lower number of grafts (P =. 02) were independent risks for late mortality. ConclusionsPatients with severe atherosclerotic aortic disease who undergo off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> have a significantly lower prevalence of hospital mortality, perioperative stroke, and overall complications than matched patients who underwent <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> with cardiopulmonary <b>bypass.</b> Routine intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography identifies severe atheromatous aortic disease and directs the choice of surgical technique...|$|R

2500|$|Emergency {{bypass surgery}} for the {{treatment}} of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) is less common than PCI or thrombolysis. From 1995 to 2004, the percentage of people with cardiogenic shock treated with primary PCI rose from 27.4% to 54.4%, while the increase in <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>graft</b> surgery (CABG) was only from 2.1% to 3.2%. [...] Emergency CABG is usually undertaken to simultaneously treat a mechanical complication, such as a ruptured papillary muscle, or a ventricular septal defect, with ensuing cardiogenic shock. In uncomplicated MI, the mortality rate can be high when the surgery is performed immediately following the infarction. If this option is entertained, the patient should be stabilized prior to surgery, with supportive interventions {{such as the use of}} an intra-aortic balloon pump. In patients developing cardiogenic shock after a myocardial infarction, both PCI and CABG are satisfactory treatment options, with similar survival rates.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveControversy exists {{regarding}} the perioperative renal effects of off-pump versus on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting.</b> Large case-matched and randomized comparisons have shown conflicting results. This study focuses on this clinical controversy. MethodsWe studied 5589 consecutive patients {{from a single}} center who underwent off-pump or on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> between 2002 and 2010. All preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data were prospectively collected. Patients were matched by using a nearest neighbor matching estimation method for average treatment effects, with bias correction (Stata 11. 2, StataCorp, College Station, Tex). The matching characteristics were age, gender, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, left ventricular grade, preoperative serum creatinine, operative priority, and Cardiac Anesthesia Risk Evaluation score. ResultsThe mean patient age was 64. 9 ± 10. 0 years, and 4387 (78. 5 %) were male. Mean calculated preoperative creatinine clearance was 82. 0 ± 32. 6 mL/min. Perioperative mortality was 1. 5 % with off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> and 1. 7 % with on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> (P = . 6). The mean change in creatinine clearance, from the preoperative value to the lowest postoperative value, was − 6. 3 ± 14. 1 mL/min with off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> versus − 5. 0 ± 15. 5 mL/min with on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> (P = . 06). After matching, patients undergoing off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> had a greater creatinine increase and greater loss of creatinine clearance postoperatively compared with patients undergoing on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> (both P < . 05).

MethodsThe Patient Discharge Database of the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development was queried for the years 1999 – 2001. In-hospital mortality and risk factors for <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> and percutaneous <b>coronary</b> intervention were obtained by using demographic data and International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification procedure and diagnosis codes. Risk models were developed by means of logistic regression analysis. ResultsOverall <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> mortality was 33 % higher and percutaneous coronary intervention mortality was twice as high in California compared with that in New York. Procedural volume (per unit population) was higher in New York. In high-volume California hospitals (> 300 procedures per year), <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> mortality was similar (California, 2. 42 %; New York, 2. 25 %). Excess <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> mortality (> 4. 0 %) occurred only in low-volume programs. Risk adjustment did not change the volume effect for <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting.</b> No volume effect was noted for risk-adjusted percutaneous coronary intervention mortality. There were no obvious differences in risk factors between California and New York. Programs performing relatively fewer <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> procedures compared with percutaneous coronary interventions were found to have significantly higher <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> mortality after adjusting for volume effects. Percutaneous coronary intervention volume is increasing and <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> volume is decreasing in both California and New York. ConclusionsExcess <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> mortality in California is related to the large number of low-volume programs. Excess percutaneous coronary intervention mortality might be related to case selection or timing of intervention. A relationship between percutaneous coronary intervention volume and <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> mortality is suggested in which increasing percutaneous coronary intervention volume relative to <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> volume might have the effect of shifting patients with undefined higher risk characteristics to <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The first {{procedure}} to treat blocked coronary arteries was <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>graft</b> surgery (CABG), wherein {{a section of}} vein or artery from elsewhere in the body is used to bypass the diseased segment of coronary artery.

The current study was performed {{to determine the effects of}} combined off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> and sutureless proximal aortic anastomotic techniques on the generation of intraoperative cerebral microemboli compared with standard <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> techniques of cardiopulmonary bypass and hand-sewn proximal anastomoses. MethodsFifty-three patients underwent off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> by using the sutureless Symmetry aortic connector device (St Jude Medical, St Paul, Minn) for all proximal anastomoses. Eighteen of these patients received intraoperative transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to determine right- and left-sided cerebral microembolic counts. These results were compared with those obtained from a similar group of 17 patients undergoing standard <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting,</b> in whom cardiopulmonary bypass and hand-sewn proximal anastomoses were used. ResultsOur use of the proximal anastomotic device in patients undergoing <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> was safe, with no aortic complications, postoperative strokes, or in-hospital deaths. Microembolic counts to both the right and left cerebral circulation were significantly reduced in the patients undergoing off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> (right = 21. 9 ± 20. 7 emboli, left = 24. 9 ± 19. 2 emboli) compared with those in patients undergoing standard <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> (right = 181. 6 ± 85. 3, left = 189. 9 ± 60. 401, P <. 0001).

To assess the pathways involved in the occurrence of postoperative prothrombotic state, {{in this study we}} evaluated plasma, monocyte-bound, and platelet-bound tissue factor expression, as well as platelet and soluble P-selectin expression, up to 1 month after off-pump and on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting.</b> MethodsThirty patient candidates for coronary surgery were randomized to undergo off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> (n = 15) or on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> (n = 15). Blood samples were collected before the intervention, after protamine administration, and 4, 8, and 30 days after surgical intervention. ResultsPlasma tissue factor levels were significantly higher than baseline both in the on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> group (from protamine administration up to 4 postoperative days) and in the off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> group (at 4 postoperative days), with no differences between groups. Basal and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocyte tissue factor expression, as well as basal and adenosine diphosphate–stimulated platelet tissue factor expression, did not show significant variations over time and were similar in the on-pump and off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> groups throughout the course of the study. Platelet expression of P-selectin, both basal and after adenosine diphosphate stimulation, did not significantly change over time and was not different in the on-pump and off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> groups. Soluble P-selectin levels in plasma were significantly higher in patients receiving on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> only at the time point after protamine administration, whereas this variable behaved similarly in the on-pump and off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> groups for the whole postoperative period. ConclusionsThe postoperative tissue factor and P-selectin expression did not differ between the on-pump and off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> groups. The distinct increase of plasma tissue factor occurring after both surgical procedures might represent a mechanism that might explain, in part, the early postoperative prothrombotic state occurring after on-pump and off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Atrial {{fibrillation}} after cardiac {{operations is}} a source of morbidity and resource consumption. Various factors common to cardiac operations have been cited as causal. Comparison of the incidences of atrial fibrillation after conventional cardiac operations and minimally invasive cardiac operations may provide some insight into the mechanisms of this complication. Methods: All patients undergoing minimally invasive direct <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> from January 26, 1996, through September 17, 1997, were evaluated for the occurrence of in-hospital postoperative atrial fibrillation. Data from these 55 patients were compared with data from a control cohort of patients undergoing conventional, solitary <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting.</b> Each patient undergoing minimally invasive direct <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> was matched by age (± 3 years) and date of operation (± 7 days) with a patient undergoing conventional <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting.</b> Results: During the period since the advent of minimally invasive direct <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> at our institution, the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation has been slightly lower among the patients undergoing this form of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> (26 %) than among the total population of patients undergoing conventional <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> (34 %). Comparison of the age-matched groups, however, showed the incidence to be slightly but not significantly greater in the minimally invasive direct <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> cohort (13 / 55, 24 %) than in the conventional <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> cohort (11 / 55, 20 %; P =. 6). The minimally invasive direct <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> group was less likely to be discharged with antiarrhythmic therapy than was the conventional <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> group (6 versus 10; P =. 006). Conclusions: According to these data, mechanisms traditionally implicated in atrial fibrillation after <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting,</b> {{such as the use of}} cardiopulmonary bypass, mechanical manipulation of the atrium, and atrial ischemia, are not causal but may be related to the duration of the arrhythmic complication. Strategies directed toward management and reduction of the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation should be focused accordingly. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1999; 117 : 298 - 301...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{published}} {{evidence has}} {{raised concerns about}} worse late mortality and increasing need for reintervention after off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting.</b> We undertook this study {{to assess the impact}} of off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> on survival and freedom from reintervention at 10 years. From January 2002 to December 2002, 307 consecutive patients who had isolated multivessel off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> at our institution were compared to a control group of 397 patients that underwent multivessel on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> during the same period. In addition, univariate and risk-adjusted comparisons between the two groups were performed at 10 years. Kaplan-Meier survival was similar for the two cohorts. After adjusting for clinical covariates, off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> did not emerge as a significant independent predictor of long-term mortality (Hazard Ratio 0. 91; 95 % Confidence Interval 0. 70 – 1. 12), readmission to hospital for cardiac cause (Hazard Ratio 0. 96; 95 % Confidence Interval 0. 78 – 1. 10), or the need for reintervention (Hazard Ratio 0. 93; 95 % Confidence Interval 0. 87 – 1. 05).

40|$|AbstractObjectivesBleeding and {{inflammation}} {{are major}} complications of extracorporeal circulation. Off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> {{may reduce the}} rate of complications, but {{it can only be}} applied in selected cases. Pilot studies have shown a potential benefit from the use of antifibrinolytic drugs, but efficacy in randomized double-blind studies evaluating off- and on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> has not been proved. MethodsWe enrolled 102 patients scheduled for on-pump (n = 51) or off-pump (n = 51) <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting.</b> Patients were separately double-blind randomly assigned to treatment with tranexamic acid (1 g as 20 -minute bolus before skin incision, followed by continuous infusion of 400 mg/h, with 500 mg added to priming in patients undergoing on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting)</b> or placebo (saline solution of equivalent volume). Bleeding in the first 24 postoperative hours was the primary outcome. Requirement for allogeneic transfusions, thrombotic complications, outcomes, and monitoring of coagulation, fibrinolysis, and inflammation were also recorded. ResultsTranexamic acid reduced total postoperative bleeding by 43 % in patients undergoing on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> and by 27 % in those undergoing off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> (P <. 0001), with 80 % reduction in bleeding exceeding 600 mL (P <. 001), 58 % reduction in the requirement for all allogeneic transfusions (P =. 07), and no apparent effect on thrombotic complications or outcome. This was associated with a reduction in plasma D-dimer levels (P <. 0001), to a greater degree in patients undergoing on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> (P <. 0001), and interleukin 6 levels (P <. 0001), to a greater degree in patients undergoing off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> (P <. 001). ConclusionsBy affecting fibrinolysis, tranexamic acid significantly reduces bleeding both in off- and on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>grafting</b> and may modulate inflammation in these surgical settings...|$|R
