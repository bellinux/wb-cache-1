40|$|In {{the current}} work, {{the effect of}} using CPO (crude palm oil) –OD (ordinary diesel) blends as fuel on the {{performance}} of <b>CI</b> (<b>compression</b> <b>ignition)</b> engine is studied. Three different blends of CPO–OD (25 %, 50 % and 75 %) were investigated using direct-injection, stationary diesel engine. The CPO–OD blends were preheated to about 60 °C before the injection to reduce the viscosity of the blends. The experiments were conducted at variable engine speeds (1000 rpm through 3000 rpm) under fixed throttle opening. The results revealed that the CPO–OD exhibited higher torque and power output at engine speeds lower than 2000 rpm, while the BSFC (brake specific fuel consumption) was found to be higher than the OD at the same engine speeds. CPO enhanced the BSFC at higher engine speeds (above 2000 rpm). The CPO–OD blends exhibited lower emissions of NOx and higher emission of CO compared to the OD...|$|E

40|$|New {{combustion}} concepts {{have been}} recently developed {{with the purpose}} to tackle the problem of high emissions level of traditional direct injection Diesel engines. A good example is the premixed charge <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> combustion. A strategy in which early injection is used causing a burning {{process in which the}} fuel burns in the premixed condition. In <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> engines, soot (particulate matter) and NOx emissions are an extremely unsolved issue. Premixed charge <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> {{is one of the most}} promising solutions that combine the advantages of both spark <b>ignition</b> and <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> combustion modes. It gives thermal efficiency close to the <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> engines and resolves the associated issues of high NOx and particulate matter, simultaneously. Premixing of air and fuel preparation is the challenging part to achieve premixed charge <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> combustion. In the present experimental study a diesel vaporizer is used to achieve premixed charge <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> combustion. A vaporized diesel fuel was mixed with the air to form premixed charge and inducted into the cylinder during the intake stroke. Low diesel volatility remains the main obstacle in preparing premixed air-fuel mixture. Exhaust gas re-circulation can be used to control the rate of heat release. The objective of this study is to reduce exhaust emission levels with maintaining thermal efficiency close to <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> engine...|$|R

40|$|Gasoline <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> (GCI), {{also known}} as {{partially}} premixed <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> (PPCI) and gasoline direct injection <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> (GDICI), engines have been considered an attractive alternative to traditional spark ignition (SI) engines. Lean-burn combustion with the direct injection of fuel eliminates throttle losses for higher thermodynamic efficiencies, and the precise control of the mixture compositions allows better emission performance such as NOx and particulate matter (PM). Recently, low octane gasoline fuel {{has been identified as}} a viable option for the GCI engine applications due to its longer ignition delay characteristics compared to diesel and lighter evaporation compared to gasoline fuel (Chang et al., 2012, "Enabling High Efficiency Direct Injection Engine With Naphtha Fuel Through Partially Premixed Charge <b>Compression</b> <b>Ignition</b> Combustion," SAE Technical Paper No. 2012 - 01 - 0677). The feasibility of such a concept has been demonstrated by experimental investigations at Saudi Aramco (Chang et al., 2012, "Enabling High Efficiency Direct Injection Engine With Naphtha Fuel Through Partially Premixed Charge <b>Compression</b> <b>Ignition</b> Combustion," SAE Technical Paper No. 2012 - 01 - 0677; Chang et al., 2013, "Fuel Economy Potential of Partially Premixed <b>Compression</b> <b>Ignition</b> (PPCI) Combustion With Naphtha Fuel," SAE Technical Paper No. 2013 - 01 - 2701). The present study aims to develop predictive capabilities for low octane gasoline fuel <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> (CI) engines with accurate characterization of the spray dynamics and combustion processes. Full three-dimensional simulations were conducted using converge as a basic modeling framework, using Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulent mixing models. An outwardly opening hollow-cone spray injector was characterized and validated against existing and new experimental data. An emphasis was made on the spray penetration characteristics. Various spray breakup and collision models have been tested and compared with the experimental data. An optimum combination has been identified and applied in the combusting GCI simulations. Linear instability sheet atomization (LISA) breakup model and modified Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor (KH-RT) break models proved to work the best for the investigated injector. Comparisons between various existing spray models and a parametric study have been carried out to study the effects of various spray parameters. The fuel effects have been tested by using three different primary reference fuel (PRF) and toluene primary reference fuel (TPRF) surrogates. The effects of fuel temperature and chemical kinetic mechanisms have also been studied. The heating and evaporative characteristics of the low octane gasoline fuel and its PRF and TPRF surrogates were examined. Copyright © 2016 by ASME...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} the combustion processes and {{the link to}} the fuel properties that are suitable for them. It describes the basic three concepts, including spark <b>ignition</b> (SI) and <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> (CI), and homogeneous charge <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> (HCCI). The fuel used in a CI engine is vastly different from that in an SI engine. In an SI engine, the fuel should sustain {{high pressure and temperature}} without autoignition. Apart from the dominating SI and CI engines, it is also possible to operate with a type of combustion: autoignition. With HCCI, the fuel and air are fully premixed before combustion as in the SI engine, but combustion is started by the increased pressure and temperature during the compression stroke. Apart from the three combustion processes, there are also a few combined or intermediate concepts, such as Spark-Assisted <b>Compression</b> <b>Ignition</b> (SACI). Those concepts are discussed in terms of the requirements of fuel properties...|$|R
