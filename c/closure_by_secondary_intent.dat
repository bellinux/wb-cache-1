40|$|The {{presence}} of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) {{at the site}} of acute injury, its ability to attract inflammatory and connective tissue cells, and its stimulatory effect on the deposition of connective tissue matrix combine to suggest that it may {{play a key role in}} the response to injury. The effect of exogenous TGF-beta form 2 on dermal wounds healing <b>by</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>intent</b> was investigated using a sponge composed of collagen and heparin as a delivery vehicle. Longitudinal lenticular-shaped wounds on the dorsum of adult guinea pigs were treated at the time of wounding with delivery vehicle containing 0. 5, 1, or 5 micrograms of purified, bovine bone-derived TGF-beta 2, and were compared with wounds that received vehicle only or were untreated. At days 8 and 14 the amount of connective tissue in the wounds and the extent of epithelialization were determined by histomorphometric methods, and wound breaking strength was determined. At day 8, but not at day 14, wounds treated with 1 or 5 micrograms of TGF-beta 2 contained a significantly higher proportion of connective tissue than did wounds treated with vehicle only, and they also exhibited higher wound strength. No effect on wound size or re-epithelialization was detected. The observations provide evidence that a single treatment with exogenous TGF-beta 2 delivered in collagen/heparin sponge vehicle can accelerate repair in guinea pig dermal wounds allowed to heal <b>by</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>intent...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{second issue}} is that of {{achieving}} meticulous hemostasis, vis-Ã -vis with the excessive use of current, which may cause weakening of the scar. Most authors have described opening the myometrium using a monopolar needle. The myometrium is damaged {{to a certain extent}} using this technique, which causes weakening of the scar, but it gives good hemostasis [5, 7]. The myometrial edges must not be sutured under tension, and hematoma formation in the wall should be avoided. Suturing myometrial edges under tension increases the chances of necrosis of the uterine musculature. Good approximation without tension will prevent hematoma formation in the uterine musculature. It will also reduce the likelihood of healing <b>by</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>intent,</b> which could make the uterine wall fragile during pregnancy [5, 7, 9].|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic leg ulcers {{remain a}} {{challenge}} to the treating physician. Such wounds often need skin grafts to heal. This necessitates a readily available, fast, simple, and standardized procedure for grafting. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to test a novel method developed for outpatient transplant procedures. METHODS: The procedure employs a handheld disposable dermatome and a roller mincer that cut the skin into standardized micrografts that can be spread out onto a suitable graft bed. Wounds were followed until healed and photographed. RESULTS: The device was successfully used to treat and close a traumatic lower limb wound and a persistent chronic venous leg ulcer. The donor site itself healed <b>by</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>intent</b> with minimal cosmetic impairment. CONCLUSION: The method was successfully used to graft 2 lower extremity wounds...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{operative}} {{and conservative}} treatments {{have been described}} in the published work {{for the management of}} sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus; yet there remains considerable debate over its ideal treatment. This report is an audit of our results using the Karydakis flap repair in the management of this condition. We analysed prospective data on 70 patients who had had a Karydakis procedure. The length of follow up ranged from 1 to 79 months (median 36 months). Seventy-one operations were carried out in 70 patients. This included 12 patients (17 %) who had previously undergone between one and four procedures (median 2) for recurrent disease. Superficial wound breakdown occurred in 27 patients (38 %) and complete wound breakdown occurred in six patients (8. 4 %). These wounds were allowed to heal <b>by</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>intent.</b> The median time to complete healing for superficial and complete wound breakdown was 80 and 84 days, respectively. Disease recurrence occurred in three patients (4. 2 %) - two of whom had recurrent disease {{at the time of this}} presentation. Of the three patients who had a recurrence after our surgery, two had a superficial breakdown and one had a complete wound breakdown. Sacrococcygeal pilonidal disease has a low recurrence rate when treated by the Karydakis operation involving flattening of the midline cleft. This procedure avoids the need for more complicated flap repairs. 3 page(s...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of synthetic, adherent, moisture vapor-permeable dressings (SAM) on dermal wounds healing <b>by</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>intent</b> has yielded the novel observation that SAM dressings severely inhibited the deposition of granulation tissue and subsequent collagenous tissue {{when compared with}} air-exposed wounds in mouse and guinea pig systems. Repair tissue was quantitated histomorphometrically in full-thickness wounds covered with SAM or left air-exposed for periods up to 3 weeks. Early in healing, mouse wounds left open to the atmosphere formed a scab which overlay a large volume of granulation tissue derived from two sources, one lateral, and the other deep and centrally located. In contrast, SAM-covered wounds contained {{only a small amount}} of granulation tissue which was derived solely from lateral sources. Granulation tissue was replaced by fibrous connective tissue overtime, and this was always less in SAM-covered wounds. Deposition of large amounts of connective tissue in air-exposed wounds was associated with significant polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cell infiltrates, while the lack of granulation tissue formation in SAM-covered sites was associated with reduced inflammation. Dressing-induced inhibition of connective tissue could be partially reversed by treatment with transforming growth factor-beta form 1 or 2. Deposition of granulation tissue in large lenticular wounds in guinea pig skin, but not in 6 -mm punch wounds, was also inhibited when the wounds were covered with SAM, and the morphology of air-exposed and SAM-covered wounds was similar to that in mice. SAM-covered wounds in mice and guinea pigs may be useful as models of chronic non-healing wounds...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: {{to present}} our {{experience}} with scheduled reoperations in 15 patients with intra-abdominal sepsis. METHODS: we have applied {{a more effective}} technique consisting of temporary abdominal closure with a nylon mesh sheet containing a zipper. We performed reoperations {{in the operating room}} under general anesthesia at an average interval of 84 hours. The revision consisted of debridement of necrotic material and vigorous lavage of the involved peritoneal area. The mean age of patients was 38. 7 years (range, 15 to 72 years); 11 patients were male, and four were female. RESULTS: forty percent of infections were due to necrotizing pancreatitis. Sixty percent were due to perforation of the intestinal viscus secondary to inflammation, vascular occlusion or trauma. We performed a total of 48 reoperations, an average of 3. 2 surgeries per patient. The mesh-zipper device was left in place for an average of 13 days. An intestinal ostomy was present adjacent to the zipper in four patients and did not present a problem for patient management. Mortality was 26. 6 %. No fistulas resulted from this technique. When intra-abdominal disease was under control, the mesh-zipper device was removed, and the fascia was closed in all patients. In three patients, the wound was closed primarily, and in 12 it was allowed to close <b>by</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>intent.</b> Two patients developed hernia; one was incisional and one was in the drain incision. CONCLUSION: the planned reoperation for manual lavage and debridement of the abdomen through a nylon mesh-zipper combination was rapid, simple, and well-tolerated. It permitted effective management of severe septic peritonitis, easy wound care and primary closure of the abdominal wall...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Magnets are {{purported to}} aid wound healing despite {{a paucity of}} {{scientific}} evidence. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of static magnetic fields on cutaneous wound healing in an animal model. The literature was reviewed to explore the historical and scientific basis of magnet therapy and to define its current role in the evidence-based practice of plastic surgery. Methods: Standardized wounds were created on the backs of 33 Sprague-Dawley rats, which were divided into 3 groups with either a 23 gauss magnet (group 1), a sham magnet (group 2), or nothing (group 3) positioned over the wound. The rate of wound <b>closure</b> <b>by</b> <b>secondary</b> intention was compared between the groups. Literature review was conducted through searches of PubMed and Ovid databases for articles pertinent to magnets and wound healing. Results: Wounds in the magnet group healed in an average of 15. 3 days, significantly faster than those in either the sham group (20. 9 days, P =. 006) or control group (20. 3 days, P <. 0001). There was no statistically significant difference between the sham and control groups (P =. 45). Conclusions: An externally applied, low-power, static magnetic field increases the rate of secondary healing. Review of the literature reveals conflicting evidence regarding the use of magnetic energy to aid the healing of bone, tendon, and skin. Level I studies are lacking and difficult to execute but are needed to define conclusively the role of magnets in clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivePoststernotomy mediastinitis, {{although}} infrequent, is {{a potentially}} life-threatening complication of cardiac surgery {{that continues to}} have a significant morbidity and mortality despite aggressive therapy. Vacuum-assisted closure uses controlled suction to provide evacuation of wound fluid, decrease bacterial colonization, stimulate granulation tissue, and reduce the need for dressing changes. MethodsOne hundred two patients from Duke University Hospital, The Durham Veterans Administration Hospital, and referring institutions underwent vacuum-assisted closure treatment. There were 63 men and 39 women, {{with a mean age of}} 67. The infection was noticed between postoperative days 8 and 34, at which time the wounds were opened and debrided. ResultsNinety-six of the 102 patients received vacuum-assisted therapy while the remaining 6 underwent daily multiple dressing changes without vacuum-assisted therapy. Fifty-three of the 96 patients required only sternal debridement, followed by wound vacuum therapy and <b>closure</b> <b>by</b> <b>secondary</b> intention, while the remaining 43 had an additional procedure. Of these, 33 patients underwent omental transposition and 10 patients had a pectoralis flap. The length of stay for all patients was 27 Â± 12 days. This was related in part to intravenous antibiotics. Hospital mortality for all patients was 3. 7 % (4 patients). Two of these patients underwent vascular flap and succumbed to multisystemic organ failure, while the other 2 received only wound vacuum therapy following debridement and succumbed to overwhelming sepsis. ConclusionVacuum-assisted drainage is an effective therapy for mediastinitis following debribement or before placement of a vascularized tissue flap...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) {{has become}} widely adopted {{over the last}} 15 years and over 1000 peer-reviewed {{publications}} are available describing its use. Despite this, there remains uncertainty regarding several aspects of usage. In order {{to respond to this}} gap a global expert panel was convened to develop evidence-based recommendations describing the use of NPWT. In this communication {{the results of the study}} of evidence in chronic wounds including pressure ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers (DFU), venous leg ulcers (VLU), and ischaemic lower limb wounds are reported. Methods: Evidence-based recommendations were obtained by a systematic review of the literature, grading of evidence, drafting of the recommendations by a global expert panel followed by a formal consultative consensus development program in which 422 independent healthcare professionals were able to agree or disagree with the recommendations. The criteria for agreement were set at 80 % agreement. Evidence and recommendations were graded according to the SIGN (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network) classification system. Results: The primary treatment goal of NPWT in most chronic wounds is to achieve wound <b>closure</b> (either <b>by</b> <b>secondary</b> intention or preparing the wound for surgical closure). Secondary goals commonly include: to reduce wound dimensions, and to improve the quality of the wound bed. Thirteen evidence based recommendations were developed in total to address these treatment goals; 4 for pressure ulcers, 4 for DFU, 3 for ischaemic lower limb wounds and 2 for VLU. Conclusion: The present evidence base is strongest for the use of NPWT in non-ischaemic DFU and weakest in VLU. The development of evidence-based recommendations for NPWT with direct validation from a large group of practicing clinicians offers a broader basis for consensus than work by an expert panel alone.
