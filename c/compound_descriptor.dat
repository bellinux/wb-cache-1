In this study twenty four coumarin derivatives were screened in vitro for antifungal activity against strains of Aspergillus. Some of the compounds exhibited significant antifungal activity with MICs values ranging between 16 and 32 &# 181;g/mL. The structure-activity relationships (SAR) study demonstrated that O-substitutions are essential for antifungal activity. It also showed that the presence of a short aliphatic chain and/or electron withdrawing groups (NO 2 and/or acetate) favor activity. These findings were confirmed using density functional theory (DFT), when calculating the LUMO density. In Principal Component Analysis (PCA), two significant principal components (PCs) explained more than 60 % of the total variance.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{compared}} the physicochemical properties of allosteric compounds to non-allosteric compounds. Those {{studies have found}} that allosteric compounds tend to be smaller, more rigid, more hydrophobic, and more drug-like than non-allosteric compounds. However, previous studies have not properly corrected for the fact that some protein targets have much more data than other systems. This generates concern regarding the possible skew that can be introduced by the inherent bias in the available data. Hence, this study aims to determine how robust the previous findings are to the addition of newer data. This study utilizes the Allosteric Database (ASD v 3. 0) and ChEMBL v 20 to systematically obtain large datasets of both allosteric and competitive ligands. This dataset contains 70, 219 and 9, 511 unique ligands for the allosteric and competitive sets, respectively. Physically relevant <b>compound</b> <b>descriptors</b> were computed to examine the differences in their chemical properties. Particular attention was given to removing redundancy in the data and normalizing across ligand diversity and varied protein targets. The resulting distributions only show that allosteric ligands tend to be more aromatic and rigid and do not confirm the increase in hydrophobicity or difference in drug-likeness. These results are robust across different normalization schemes...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{determine}} whether a new modeling methodology using fuzzy logic can predict skin permeability coefficients that are given <b>compound</b> <b>descriptors</b> that have been proven to affect percutaneous penetration. Methods. Three fuzzy inference models were developed using subtractive clustering to define natural structures within the data and assign subsequent rules. The numeric parameters describing the rules were refined through the use of an Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System implemented in MatLab. Each model was evaluated using the entire data set. Then predicted outputs were compared to the published experimental data. Results. All databases produced fuzzy inference models that successfully predicted skin permeability coefficients, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0. 83 to 0. 97. The lowest correlation coefficient resulted from a model using log octanol/water partition coefficient and molecular weight as inputs with two input membership functions evaluated by two fuzzy rules. The correlation coefficient of 0. 97 occurred when log octanol/water partition coefficient and hydrogen bond donor activity were used as inputs with three input membership functions evaluated by three fuzzy rules.

Fuzzy rule-based models are a realistic and promising tool {{that can be used to}} successfully model and predict skin permeability coefficients as well as or better than previous algorithms with fewer input...|$|R

Depending on the yearly tonnages produced or imported, (eco-) toxicological and chemical fate data of varying degrees of detail will have to be produced. It has been forecast that these new requirements will result in higher costs for registration and an increased need for animal testing. Some of this additional workload could be avoided by making use of in vitro or in silico prediction methods. At Eawag (Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology) several research groups are working on the development and validation of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) and related methods to predict ecotoxicological and fate endpoints, such as reactivities in or partitioning between different environmental media, based on chemical structure or easily measurable physico-chemical properties.

However, the availability of sequence and structure data has now {{made it possible to}} develop approaches to design pharmacological agents that can discriminate successfully between their related binding sites. In this study, we have quantified the relationship between 12 625 distinct protease inhibitors and their bioactivity against 67 targets of the serine protease family (20 213 data points) in an integrative manner, using proteochemometric modelling (PCM). The benchmarking of 21 different target descriptors motivated the usage of specific binding pocket amino acid descriptors, which helped in the identification of active site residues and selective compound chemotypes affecting compound affinity and selectivity. PCM models performed better than alternative approaches (models trained using exclusively <b>compound</b> <b>descriptors</b> on all available data, QSAR) employed for comparison with R 2 /RMSE values of 0. 64 AE 0. 23 / 0. 66 AE 0. 20 vs. 0. 35 AE 0. 27 / 1. 05 AE 0. 27 log units, respectively. Moreover, the interpretation of the PCM model singled out various chemical substructures responsible for bioactivity and selectivity towards particular proteases (thrombin, trypsin and coagulation factor 10) in agreement with the literature. For instance, absence of a tertiary sulphonamide was identified to be responsible for decreased selective activity (by on average 0. 27 AE 0. 65 pChEMBL units) on FA 10.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} a novel and generic framework for image segmentation using a <b>compound</b> image <b>descriptor</b> that encompasses both colour and texture information in an adaptive fashion. The developed image segmentation method extracts the texture information using low-level image descriptors (such as the Local Binary Patterns (LBP)) and colour information by using colour space partitioning. The main {{advantage of this}} approach is the analysis of the textured images at a micro-level using the local distribution of the LBP values, and in the colour domain by analysing the local colour distribution obtained after colour segmentation. The use of the colour and texture information separately has proven to be inappropriate for natural images as they are generally heterogeneous with respect to colour and texture characteristics. Thus, the main problem is to use the colour and texture information in a joint descriptor that can adapt to the local properties of the image under analysis.

40|$|International audienceNatural {{products}} and synthetic compounds are a valuable source of new small molecules leading to novel drugs to cure diseases. However identifying new biologically active small molecules {{is still a}} challenge. In this paper, we introduce a new activity prediction approach using Bayesian belief network for classification (BBNC). The roots of the network are the fragments composing a compound. The leaves are, on one side, the activities to predict and, on another side, the unknown compound. The activities are represented by sets of known compounds, and sets of inactive compounds are also used. We calculated a similarity between an unknown compound and each activity class. The more similar activity is assigned to the unknown compound. We applied this new approach on eight well-known data sets extracted from the literature and compared its performance to three classical machine learning algorithms. Experiments showed that BBNC provides interesting prediction rates (from 79 % accuracy for high diverse data sets to 99 % for low diverse ones) with a short time calculation. Experiments also showed that BBNC is particularly effective for homogeneous data sets but {{has been found to}} perform less well with structurally heterogeneous sets. However, it is important to stress that we believe that using several approaches whenever possible for activity prediction can often give a broader understanding of the data than using only one approach alone. Thus, BBNC is a useful addition to the computational chemist's toolbox. ■ INTRODUCTION Due to the similar property principle, 1 structurally similar compounds are expected to exhibit similar properties and similar biological activities. This principle is exploited for in silico discovery of new drugs with the emergence of an activity prediction technology based on chemical structures. A variety of computational approaches for target or activity prediction were published over the past several years. For example, quantitative structure−activity relationship (QSAR) 2 − 5 was established on the hypothesis that compounds with similar physicochemical properties and/or structure share similar activities. The effectiveness of a QSAR analysis relies both on selecting the relevant descriptors for modeling the biological activity of interest and on the choice of a good quantitative model that maps the <b>compound</b> <b>descriptors</b> to chemical property or biological activity by means of statistical techniques. In similarity searching strategies, an unknown compound (the target) is compared to a set of compounds with known activities.

Finally, we evaluated the deposition of n-TiO 2 under different surface roughness using a new technique, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D). We observed that surface roughness resulted in higher deposition of n-TiO 2 under favorable condition compared to flat surfaces according to DLVO theory. These results represent the first effort to show the effects of surface roughness on the deposition of n-TiO 2. ...|$|R
40|$|NAS 21, NAS 91 and its {{derivatives}} {{belong to}} class FabZ inhibitors have been focused to develop better anti-malarial drugs. Library of 17 analogues was designed from NAS 21, NAS 91 scaffold structure, and NAS 75, NAS 79 was considered for computational study. Their molecular interactions, binding affinities with FabZ was studied using receptor-centric approaches: glide docking, molecular mechanics using generalized Born/surface area solvation model and multi-ligand bimolecular association with energetic. Prediction models were developed between FabZ inhibition activity (pIC 50) of these <b>compounds</b> and molecular <b>descriptors</b> like glide score, binding energy and calculated free energy binding. The r 2 value varies from 0. 66 - 0. 77 indicating good data fit, and r 2 cv was {{within range of}} 0. 64 - 0. 76, indicating acceptable predictive capabilities of models. A linear correlation was observed between predicted and experimented pIC 50 with r 2 = 0. 66 - 0. 78, suggesting the robustness of models. The ensemble-average free energy estimation including implicit solvation energy terms significantly improves the hit enrichment of virtual screening...|$|R
