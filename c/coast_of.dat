5|$|A {{river of}} sea water, called the Atlantic North Equatorial Current, flows westward off the <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> Central Africa. When this current {{interacts with the}} northeastern <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> South America, the current forks into two {{branches}}. One passes into the Caribbean Sea, while a second, the Antilles Current, flows north and east of the West Indies. These two branches rejoin north of the Straits of Florida.|$|E

5|$|Another unusual feature {{found in}} the abyssal and hadal zones is the cold seep, {{sometimes}} called a cold vent. This {{is an area of}} the seabed where seepage of hydrogen sulfide, methane and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid occurs, often {{in the form of a}} deep-sea brine pool. The first cold seeps were discovered in 1983, at a depth of 3200meters in the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, cold seeps have been discovered in many other areas of the World Ocean, including the Monterey Submarine Canyon just off Monterey Bay, California, the Sea of Japan, off the Pacific <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> Costa Rica, off the Atlantic <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> Africa, off the <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> Alaska, and under an ice shelf in Antarctica.|$|E
50|$|John Dory are coastal fish, {{found on}} the <b>coasts</b> <b>of</b> Africa, South East Asia, New Zealand, Australia, the <b>coasts</b> <b>of</b> Japan, and on the <b>coasts</b> <b>of</b> Europe.

5|$|Around {{the same}} time, a {{separate}} tropical cyclone {{formed in the}} western Atlantic. It moved from off the <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> Florida to near Bermuda between October 24 and November 1, brushing the coast from St. Augustine to Charleston with gale-force winds. No significant damage occurred, though coastal flooding and heavy rainfall that caused a break in an earthen dam were reported along the <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> Georgia.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} requiem sharks, the blacktip shark {{exhibits}} vivipary. Females typically {{give birth to}} four to seven (range one to 10) pups every other year, making use of shallow coastal nurseries that offer plentiful food and fewer predators. Known nurseries include Pine Island Sound, Terra Ceia Bay, and Yankeetown along the Gulf <b>Coast</b> <b>of</b> Florida, Bulls Bay on the <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> South Carolina, and Pontal do Paraná on the <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> Brazil. Although adult blacktip sharks are highly mobile and disperse over long distances, they are philopatric and return to their original nursery areas to give birth. This results {{in a series of}} genetically distinct breeding stocks that overlap in geographic range.|$|E

As Greg intensified, a hurricane warning was raised from Arroyo Seco southward, and for the east <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> Baja California from La Paz southward. A tropical storm watch was raised from north of La Paz to Loreto. Late on September7, the hurricane warning {{was reduced to a}} tropical storm warning as Greg weakened.
