5000|$|Boudinage is a {{geological}} {{term for}} structures formed by extension, where a rigid tabular body such as hornfels, is stretched and deformed amidst less competent surroundings. The <b>competent</b> <b>bed</b> begins to break up, forming sausage-shaped boudins. Boudinage is common and can occur at any scale, from microscopic to lithospheric, {{and can be}} found in all terranes. In lithospheric-scale tectonics, boudinage of strong layers can signify large-scale creep transfer of rock matter. [...] The study of boudinage can, also, help provide insight to the forces involved in tectonic deformation of rocks and their strength.|$|E

Reconstruction of the paleostress states corresponding to and studies on fluid inclusions and stable isotopes from the wall-rocks and the veins filled in the fractures have been carried out. The first vein, which occurs in the fractures limited to <b>competent</b> <b>bed</b> and perpendicular to the layer, was precipitated from liquids during diagenesis. Homogenization temperatures (Th) of fluid inclusions in the veins range from 126 °C to 267 °C, which {{are similar to those}} obtained by the wall-rocks, i. e., from 152 °C to 227 °C. The second-generation veins were filled in three groups of faults corresponding to NE-SW compression. Homogenization temperatures of the fluid inclusions show bimodal distribution, with peak Th-population values from 140 °C to 210 °C and 230 °C to 270 °C. The salinity values exhibit evidently two groups either. The bimodal distribution of both homogenization temperatures and salinities indicates that the fluid flowing within the fractures posses two stages of evolution. The third-generation vein was filled in NNW-SSE to NWW-SEE trending strike-slip faults, which were formed under NW-SE tectonic compression. The homogenization temperatures obtained by fluid inclusions in the veins range from 101 °C to 257 °C. The wide change in Th values possibly indicates that re-equilibrium has occurred for the fluid inclusions during the activity of the faults. The δ 13 C and δ 18 O values of the wall rocks range from - 1. 6 ‰ to 5. 6 ‰ and 16. 7 ‰ to 25. 2 ‰, respectively. The values of δ 18 O are similar to or lower slightly than marine carbonate(29 ‰). The δ 13 C and δ 18 O values of the first-generation veins are from - 1. 8 ‰ to 2. 2 ‰ and 18. 4 ‰ to 23. 1 ‰, respectively, which {{are similar to those of}} wallrocks except showing smaller variation. The δ 13 C and δ 18 O values of the second-generation veins range from - 9. 2 ‰ to 4. 7 ‰ and 13. 2 ‰ to 27. 9 ‰. Compared to wallrocks and the first-generation veins, the second-generation veins exhibit larger variability in both δ 13 C and δ 18 O values. The third-generation veins show similar situation to the second-generation veins in δ 13 C values and the large variation in carbon isotopic compositions with the δ 13 C values from - 9. 2 ‰ to 4. 8 ‰. But the δ 18 O values are not as large variable as that of the second-generation veins, and the δ 18 O values are from 12. 8 ‰ to 19. 8 ‰. The δD values measured by fluid inclusions from the second- and third-generation veins are from - 62 ‰ to - 90 ‰ and - 74 ‰ to - 87 ‰, respectively. On the plot of δ 18 Ofluids vs δDfluids, parts of samples are fall in the scope of formation water, some samples show slightly lower δD values relative to formation water...|$|E

50|$|The {{behavior}} of chevron folds are effectively {{controlled by the}} characteristics of the stratigraphy under deformation. Ideally, beds should alternate between high competence and low competence. The stability of chevron folding stringently requires regular thickness in the high-competence layers; conversely, regularity in low competence layers has been found to have very little effect on stability. The length of the bed and the thickness of <b>competent</b> <b>beds</b> further determines the structural stability. A 1:10 ratio between the thickness of <b>competent</b> <b>beds</b> and the length appears to be the threshold required for the formation of chevron folds. Smaller ratios require too much flow in the more ductile layers. Given high length to thickness and low high-competency to low-competency thickness ratios, irregularities in the thickness of the high-competence beds can be accommodated. However, local features appear as a consequence.|$|R

40|$|The Anti-Atlas belt of Morocco is a Variscan chain {{which appears}} as a huge {{anticlinorium}} oriented NE-SW. In the internal part of this structure, the actual relief shows the basement cropping out as inliers (Piqué 2001) or boutonnières. The cover, a thick pile of Paleozoic sediments up to 12 km thick, is gently folded and of low grade metamorphism in its lower level. The lack of major décollement, of a deformation front or thrust-fault makes the Anti-Atlas an unusual type of belt, which does not fit with classic schemes. The Anti-Atlas has been {{considered to be a}} thick skinned fold belt, with the crystalline basement involved in the horizontal shortening and where the folding of the cover fits to a “buckle fold” mode (Burkhard et al. 2006). This structural style is determined by two key parameters: the total thickness of Paleozoic cover series and the relative abundance of shale vs. <b>competent</b> marker <b>beds.</b> The Eastern Anti-Atlas has particular features which are not found elsewhere in the Anti-Atlas. Its location at the intersection between the NW-SE Ougarta chain and the ENE-WSW main body of the Anti-Atlas, produces an egg-box interference pattern. The significance of minor folds and thrusts in the <b>competent</b> <b>beds</b> and their particular orientation is examined. The fact that the cover in the Eastern Anti-Atlas is only 6 km thick, which changes the shale vs <b>competent</b> <b>beds</b> ratio, influences its structural style. The feature that distinguishes the most Eastern Anti-Atlas is the presence of large E-W normal faults affecting the whole structure and creating extensional fault-related folding in the cover...|$|R
50|$|In {{southern}} Europe, the Cretaceous {{is usually}} a marine system consisting of <b>competent</b> limestone <b>beds</b> or incompetent marls.

50|$|In geology {{competence}} {{refers to}} the degree of resistance of rocks to either erosion or deformation in terms of relative mechanical strength. In mining 'competent rocks' are those in which an unsupported opening can be made. Competent rocks are more commonly exposed at outcrop as they tend to form upland areas and high cliffs or headlands, where present on a coastline. Incompetent rocks tend to form lowlands and are often poorly exposed at the surface. During deformation <b>competent</b> <b>beds</b> tend to deform elastically by either buckling or faulting/fracturing. Incompetent beds tend to deform more plastically, although it is the 'competence contrast' between different rocks that is most important in determining the types of structure that are formed. The relative competence of rocks may change with temperature, such as in metamorphosed limestones, which are relatively competent at low metamorphic grade but become highly incompetent at high metamorphic grade.|$|R
40|$|Along {{the slopes}} and in {{adjacent}} basinal areas of Bahamian platforms, periplatform ooze forms the host sediment for variable proportions of carbonate turbidites. In unlithified sections, these turbidites appear as unconsolidated layers intercalated with stiffer ooze. Within an individual turbidite, differences in grain size result in variations in consolidation and physical properties. With decreasing grain size, water content and porosity decrease, and two distinct surfaces develop {{at the lower}} and upper boundaries of the turbidite. These surfaces are potential instability horizons where mass-wasting can occur. Therefore, a relation between turbidites and slumping frequency is proposed. The higher proportion of turbidites in sediments deposited on low-angle, accretionary terrains, such as the toe of the northern slope of Little Bahama Bank, probably facilitates frequent, small-scale slumping and creeping, as seen in seismic profiles. In contrast, slumping is less frequent along the steeper (12 °) bypass slope in Exuma Sound, where turbidites are rarely found. Where the background sediment was initially a pelagic nannofossil ooze rather than a periplatform ooze, mineralogical composition results in lithification differences. In lithified sections having chalk as the background sediment, turbidites display a higher sonic velocity, indicating {{that they are the}} more <b>competent</b> <b>beds.</b> This lithification variation is the result of differential diagenesis between the platform-derived turbidites, enriched in metastable carbonates, and the calcitic nannofossil ooze of the background sediment. The different lithification owing to dissimilar mineralogical composition could also influence fluid migration in carbonate sequences. In a periplatform sequence, the more porous turbidite might be the fluid conduit, whereas in a pelagic sequence the chalky background sediment allows for fluid migration...|$|R
40|$|The {{scaling law}} {{distribution}} properties of fault-related folds were assessed {{in comparison to}} the distributions of their associated faults {{to determine whether or not}} they are governed by the same scaling law properties. The fault-related fold and fault data were collected from three- dimensional seismic data modelled in TrapTester and Petrel from the Gulf of Mexico (TrapTester), Gulf of Gabès (TrapTester) and the Inner Moray Firth (Petrel). They were sampled by one- dimensional multiline sampling (TrapTester) and two-dimensional (Petrel) fault and fold length sampling. To ensure the accuracy of this data collection method a comparative test of methodologies was carried out using the Gullfaks, North Sea data set and comparing it to the results published by Fossen and Rørnes (1995). By validating the methodologies (TrapTester) used the data sets were analysed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling test on a “moving window” in R to assess the scaling law distributions of the data. Based on previous findings from published work the power law distribution was tested first since fault populations are understood to follow this distribution. An exponential distribution and log-normal distribution were also tested. The results of this suggest that fault-related folds are not necessarily governed by the same distributions of the underlying fault population. It is proposed that fault-related folding is heavily controlled by the competence and thickness of the surrounding stratigraphic units, as well as the dip angle of the underlying faults. Incompetent beds will accommodate more folding compared to <b>competent</b> <b>beds</b> which are more likely to fault. A thinner stratigraphic unit will be unable to accommodate as much folding as a thicker stratigraphic unit. An underlying fault with a low dip angle will cause the overlying stratigraphic units to preferentially fault and won’t propagate as large a fold throw in comparison to underlying faults with a high dip angle...|$|R
40|$|The Fuegian thrust-fold belt (TFB) {{forms the}} thin-skinned outer wedge of the Andes in Tierra del Fuego. Using {{subsurface}} and outcrop data from two areas (Western and Eastern) of the TFB front in Argentina we aimed to verify and characterize the apparent structural variations along the strike. Both areas reveal pro- and retro-vergent fault-related folds detached at similar horizons, with a youngest early to middle (?) Miocene deformation age. However, the Western Area has gentle, large-wavelength folds whereas the Eastern Area {{is characterized by}} a very tight structural geometry, with closer fold geometries. This difference manifests itself in the shortening of analogous structures: below 5. 5 % in the west as against ~ 22 % in the Eastern Area. Our findings verify structural style variations along the strike and suggest that the Eastern Area endured higher strain. We evaluate two possible causes of this strain gradient, assuming homogeneous regional shortening: (i) lateral rheological variations {{at the base of the}} thrust wedge, namely the occurrence of more <b>competent</b> <b>beds</b> which would have restrained the propagation of the detachment toward the east; and (ii) the effect of strong buttressing in the eastern TFB exerted by the Río Chico arch basement promontory during deformation. Published results, together with our current subsurface and outcrop data, rule out significant rheological gradients in a preferred direction along the TFB. On the other hand, we present evidence of the nucleation of frontal thrusts above basement steps at the Río Chico arch western margin, which comprise local buttresses. We speculate that this buttressing was mantained along the TFB front and is enhanced toward the east, where forward TFB propagation was hindered due to the southern projection of the Río Chico promontory. This would explain the higher strain and more complex structural style in the Eastern Area...|$|R
2500|$|The {{compliance}} of rock layers {{is referred}} to as competence: a <b>competent</b> layer or <b>bed</b> of rock can withstand an applied load without collapsing and is relatively strong, while an incompetent layer is relatively weak. [...] When rock behaves as a fluid, {{as in the case of}} very weak rock such as rock salt, or any rock that is buried deeply enough, it typically shows flow folding (also called passive folding, because little resistance is offered): the strata appear shifted undistorted, assuming any shape impressed upon them by surrounding more rigid rocks. The strata simply serve as markers of the folding. Such folding is also a feature of many igneous intrusions and glacier ice.|$|R
40|$|Samples from a <b>competent</b> {{greywacke}} <b>bed</b> {{within the}} Aberystwyth Grits at Cwm Tydi, Cardiganshire, reveal a preferred dimensional orientation of clastic grains parallel or subparallel to the cleavage. Plots of grain axial ratio against orientation () indicate that grain-shape changes have occurred {{as well as}} alignment of the long axes. These plots are compared with those predicted by a mechanism involving homogeneous strain superimposed on initially randomly-oriented elliptical markers. New reference curves facilitate a straightforward comparison of actual plots with the theoretically-predicted ones. The diagrams show consistently a broader scatter of Ø values than the homogeneous model predicts suggesting that other mechanisms have been operative during the deformation. Textural evidence under the microscope strongly supports a mechanism involving solution of grain contacts lying along distinct “channel-ways” parallel to the cleavage. A simple pressure solution model involving reduction of grain size is considered. The model produces a low degree of preferred orientation but substantial changes of axial ratio thus giving similar, though not identical, diagrams to those obtained from the rocks. The cleavage probably owes its existence less to the preferred orientation of the grains than to the preferred location of the grain contacts along the “channel-ways”...|$|R
40|$|We analyse {{a system}} of normal faults that cut sandstones, siltstones, mudstone, coal, and tuff at Hail Creek coal mine in the Bowen Basin, NE Australia. Our {{detailed}} mapping utilized the dense borehole network and strip mining operations. The fault surfaces have complex geometries, yet {{the components of the}} individual faults show similar orientation variability to the whole fault system. The faults and their components dip to the SE, NW, NNW, and SSE with an orthorhombic symmetry that we refer to as polymodal. There are multiple displacement peaks, with complementary changes on adjacent faults. This observation suggests kinematic coherence between neighbouring faults. Twin displacement peaks on some faults suggest that segment linkage occurred on a scale of hundreds of m. These polymodal faults follow the same displacement – length scaling laws as other normal faults. Fault dip is affected by lithology, with steeper dips in more <b>competent</b> (sandstone) <b>beds.</b> An ‘odd axis’ construction using whole fault planes suggests that they formed in a triaxial strain state (three different principal strains) with vertical shortening, and horizontal extension along principal directions of 148 ° and 058 °. Odd axis constructions using individual fault components, as opposed to whole faults, give similar principal strain orientations and maximum strain ratios. The variable component orientations, and the consistency of fault kinematics on different scales, suggest that the faults evolved by the propagation or linkage of smaller components with variable orientations, within the same bulk strain state...|$|R
40|$|A roof of an {{underground}} opening composed of horizontally <b>bedded</b> <b>competent</b> rock is commonly encountered in mining and civil engineering. The mechanical behavior of such roof resembles {{a stack of}} elastic beams rigidly or compliantly confined at the abutments and sagging under their own weight. The clamping action of a bolting system will forestall slip between strata. When the strata vary in thickness, it has been largely assumed that considering friction and suspension effects, the average force per unit area exerted by the bolt system should include an elusively defined transferred load Δq. The purpose {{of this research is}} to analytically and numerically calculate this transferred load, taking into consideration all related parameters. A stress function solution of a gravity beam is proposed to account for the load transference, i. e. the vertical stress component sgr;yy. A two-member stratified roof with strata of varying thickness is then modeled with a finite differences code and the results are used to verify the assumptions. Limits of applicability of load transference are prescribed for the specific cases that are analyzed. © 2011 ASCE...|$|R
40|$|A stratigraphic {{analysis}} of the Lower Palaeozoic in the Bernesga-Porma area revealed relatively stable shelf conditions in the miogeosynclinal part of a geosyncline located further to the south (fig. 5). The Caledonian period might be represented by the synsedimentary volcanism (dolerites and tuffites) during the Ordovician and Silurian. With {{the onset of the}} Devonian, the shelf area became progressively less stable and is separated into the Bernesga and Esla sub-basins by the WSW-ENE trending Pardomino ridge (fig. 15). The Leonide facies south of the León line varies in composition and becomes thinner towards this line (fig. 14 and app. III and IV). The WNW-ENE trending Sabero-Gordón hinge line becomes apparent during the Upper Devonian; it separates an area of progressively steeper uplift and subsequent erosion in the northern Leonides from an area of continued subsidence and rapid sedimentation in the southern Alba and Corada sub-basins (fig. 16). The fundamental León, Sabero-Gordón and Pardomino lines were reactivated during the Lower Carboniferous (fig. 23) which is identified by shallow marine, condensed sequences and again during the deposition of the Upper Carboniferous flysch and molasse facies in tectonically controlled asymmetric basins (figs. 30 and 66). The Bretonic epeirogenic phase resulted in a ± 4 ° SSW tilt of the Leonides west of the Pardomino line (fig. 14) and further accentuated the outwedging of the strata. The geometry of the asymmetric folding and thrusting of the Leónides during the initial Sudetic folding phase is a direct consequence of the palaeogeography and facies boundaries recorded (fig. 63). Subsequent erosion of these culminations produced the coarse-grained material of the flysch facies, consisting of graded wackes and turbidites (fig. 65). The gradually climaxing Asturian folding phase migrated in time and space; the oldest tecto-facies are developed on top of the Visean Alba griottes south of the Sabero-Gordón line, while north of this line they are found on top of the Namurian (A) Caliza de Montaña Formation (fig. 31). The youngest fusulinid assemblages in the San Emiliano Formation south of the León line indicate the base of the Westphalian, while the youngest fossil determinations in the Lena Formation north of this line are indicative of the Upper Westphalian (app. V). The depositional environment changes from marine to paralic and finally to continental. In the Bernesga-Porma area, the Leonides consist of seven thrust units, which are more than 25 km long and approximately 2 km thick; the maximal recorded displacement is more than 3 km. These thrust units were back-folded and faulted before they were partly covered by Stephanian molasse facies, deposited in intramountainous basins in the back- and fore-deeps of the thrust-folds. In the disharmonically folded Piedrafita Unit parasitic and cascade folds occur (figs. 70 and 71); stretching of the <b>competent</b> <b>beds</b> (boudinage) and flattening of argillaceous beds (slaty cleavage) were also recorded (fig. 60). The Stephanian Matallana and Rucayo basins are mainly deformed by reversed faulting in the basement (fig. 72) during and after the molasse deposition (late-orogenic Saalic phase). Epithermal mineralizations and silicious mylonite lenses mark the most important fault zones. The large gap in the stratigraphic record (Stephanian-Upper Cretaceous) represents the period of structural adjustment and uplift of the Hercynian core of the Cantabrian Mountains. After the Upper Cretaceous transgression had ceased (fig. 39), a strong morphogenetic uplift (> 1 km) related to the Savian phase (Oligocene) took place along a narrow E-W trending flexure zone (fig. 76). The extensive erosion resulted in the deposition of limestone conglomerates in torrential piedmont fans towards the down-warped León Basin (fig. 74). The geometry of the associated mountain flank thrusting was also studied from detailed gravity profiles covering the entire area (fig. 75). The tectono-stratigraphical evolution of the Bernesga-Porma area is sketched in figure 77...|$|R
40|$|The Shickshock Group of Cambrian-Ordovician metavolcanic, and {{metasedimentary}} rocks outcropsalong {{mountains of}} the same name bounded to the south by the Shickshock Fault. Within these rocks a schistosity S 1 and layering are parallel, and there is a lineation L 1 marked by a mineral elongation and fine striation. These structures suggest the presence of isoclinal, F 1 folds, and the Shickshock rocks are considered to form the core of a major recumbent F 1 fold. The absence of F 1 structures from Lower Ordovician rocks to the north suggests a pre-Lower Ordovician period of folding. F 2 folds, the dominant structures in the area, deform all Paleozoic rocks older than upper Middle Devonian and form the stratigraphically defined Gaspe Synclinorium, an Acadian structure. On the basis of the inclination and symmetry of the small scale F 2 folds, the Gaspe synclinorium is divided into three major domains. (I) The northern limb of the synclinorium, north of the Shickshock Fault, where folds in Cambrian to Ordovician rocks are overturned northwest; anticlines have short northwest limbs. (II) The northern limb, south of the fault to the axial area of the synclinorium, where folds in SiluroDevonian. rocks are upright; folds are both asymmetric as in domain I and symmetric. (III) The southern limb of the synclinorium where axial planes of folds in Ordovician to Devonian rocks are inclined northwest; anticlines have short southeast limbs. The folds in domains I and II are gradational in inclination and symmetry; but are separated by vertical displacement across the Shickshock Fault. In the study area, the F 2 folds affect the S 1 schistosity and trend northeast, co-axially with F 1 structures. However, to the northeast, near Mount Albert, F 1 and F 2 structures are divergent. The F 2 folds vary in shape with lithology, from open in competent, to isoclinal in incompetent rocks. They are dominantly flattened concentric in competent limestone and sandstone, and similar in style in argillite. The folds are doubiy plunging, and the axes of variable plunge lie on planar axial surfaces. Slickensides on axial-plane calcite veins dominantly plunge down the dip. This is regarded as the movement direction during the F 2 folding. Variation in the amount of movement resulted in the curved fold axes. It is suggested that the folds progressed from an initial concentric mechanism determined, by the <b>competent</b> <b>beds</b> to a flattening and extension along the axial planes determined by flow of the incompetent beds. An S 2 cleavage, a close fracture set parallel to the F 2 axial planes is present in all incompetent rocks except those of the Shickshock Group foliated by S 1. A classification of the cleavage is suggested by means of the ratio of slip across individual fractures and the average fracture spacing. The cleavage is termed fracture if the ratio is less than. 25, and fracture slip if it is. 25 or more. F 3 folds, restricted to the northern coastal sections are mostly S-shaped in plan, and plunge steeply to the southeast. A rough S 3 fracture lies parallel to the steep axial planes striking E-W. The folds may have formed by N-S compression and sinistral shear along the northeast striking F 2 structures. F 4 folds, restricted to the belt of Cambrian Ordovician rocks with S 1 schistosity, are mesoscopic to microscopic, open with sharp rectilinear hinges, and resemble kink bands. The folds trending NW-SE are S and Z shaped and are considered as a conjugate system developed in response to a northeast-southwest compression parallel to the general strike of the country rock. A low plunging fine kink lineation and larger kink bands with low dipping axial planes that deform S 2 occur along the axial area of the synclinorium. The kink bands consistently displace the upper rocks away from-the axis. They are considered as late stage structures. Joint patterns in competent rocks (sandstone, siltstone and limestone) consist of dip, strike, and oblique joints which are normal to bedding. In slates there is a predominance of dip sets accompanied by oblique sets, both of which are steeply inclined. Strike joints in slates are rare and form normal to cleavage. The steep dip joints in slates bear no consistent angular relationship to meso-F 2 fold axes. Thus it is suggested that joint planes-in folded rocks are independent of attitudes of local folds and are post-kinematic in origin...|$|R
