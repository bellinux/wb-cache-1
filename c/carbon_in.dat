5|$|As farmers {{worldwide}} {{respond to}} higher crop prices {{in order to}} maintain the global food supply-and-demand balance, pristine lands are cleared to replace the food crops that were diverted elsewhere to biofuels' production. Because natural lands, such as rainforests and grasslands, store <b>carbon</b> <b>in</b> their soil and biomass as plants grow each year, clearance of wilderness for new farms translates to a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Due to this change in the carbon stock of the soil and the biomass, indirect land use change has consequences in the GHG balance of a biofuel.|$|E
5|$|By August 2012, {{the very}} low European carbon prices dragged the NZU price down to $NZ4.55 per tonne of <b>carbon.</b> <b>In</b> mid September 2012, NZUs were selling for $NZ4.20 a tonne.

5|$|During {{the second}} half of 1998 an {{optically}} thick dust shell obscured Sakurai's Object, causing a rapid decrease in visibility of the star, until in 1999 it disappeared from optical wavelength observations altogether. Infrared observations showed that the dust cloud around the star is primarily <b>carbon</b> <b>in</b> an amorphous form. In 2009 it was discovered that the dust shell is strongly asymmetrical, as a disc with a major axis oriented at an angle of 134°, and inclination of around 75°. The disc is thought to be growing more opaque due to the fast spectral evolution of the source towards lower temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Isotopes {{of carbon}} are atomic nuclei that contain six protons plus {{a number of}} {{neutrons}} (varying from 2 to 16). Carbon has two stable, naturally occurring isotopes. The isotope carbon-12 (C) forms 98.93% of the carbon on Earth, while carbon-13 (C) forms the remaining 1.07%. The concentration of C is further increased in biological materials because biochemical reactions discriminate against C. In 1961, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) adopted the isotope carbon-12 {{as the basis for}} atomic weights. Identification of <b>carbon</b> <b>in</b> nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments is done with the isotope C.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} carbon–halogen bonds, the C–Cl bond {{is a common}} {{functional}} group that forms part of core organic chemistry. Formally, compounds with this functional group may be considered organic derivatives of the chloride anion. Due to the difference of electronegativity between chlorine (3.16) and carbon (2.55), the <b>carbon</b> <b>in</b> a C–Cl bond is electron-deficient and thus electrophilic. Chlorination modifies the physical properties of hydrocarbons in several ways: chlorocarbons are typically denser than water due to the higher atomic weight of chlorine versus hydrogen, and aliphatic organochlorides are alkylating agents because chloride is a leaving group.|$|E
5|$|Oceans {{contain the}} {{greatest}} quantity of actively-cycled <b>carbon</b> <b>in</b> {{the world and}} are {{second only to the}} lithosphere in the amount of carbon they store. The oceans' surface layer holds large amounts of dissolved organic carbon that is exchanged rapidly with the atmosphere. The deep layer's concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon is about 15 percent higher than that of the surface layer and it remains there for much longer periods of time. Thermohaline circulation exchanges carbon between these two layers.|$|E

5|$|Phosphorus {{could be}} {{intentionally}} introduced into diamond grown by {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) at concentrations up to ~0.01%. Phosphorus substitutes <b>carbon</b> <b>in</b> the diamond lattice. Similar to nitrogen, phosphorus has one more electron than carbon and thus acts as a donor; however, the ionization energy of phosphorus (0.6 eV) is much smaller than that of nitrogen (1.7 eV) and is small enough for room-temperature thermal ionization. This important property of phosphorus in diamond favors electronic applications, such as UV light emitting diodes (LEDs, at 235nm).|$|E
5|$|To inhibit corrosion, {{at least}} 11% {{chromium}} {{is added to}} steel so that a hard oxide forms on the metal surface; {{this is known as}} stainless steel. Tungsten slows the formation of cementite, keeping <b>carbon</b> <b>in</b> the iron matrix and allowing martensite to preferentially form at slower quench rates, resulting in high speed steel. On the other hand, sulfur, nitrogen, and phosphorus are considered contaminants that make steel more brittle and are removed from the steel melt during processing.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are {{the most}} {{abundant}} biological entity in aquatic environments—there are about one million {{of them in a}} teaspoon of seawater—and they are essential to the regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems.

30|$|Almost {{complete}} {{conversion of}} anthracene with high selectivity to 9, 10 -anthraquinone {{is possible and}} 9, 10 -anthraquinone of 99 % purity is industrially produced in this way [32]. Secondary and complete combustion products are also obtained is small amounts. <b>Carbons</b> <b>in</b> the 9 - and 10 -positions are the most reactive centers of attack in the anthracene molecule [6]. The attack of oxygen on these <b>carbons</b> results <b>in</b> the production of 9, 10 -anthraquinone. On the other hand, the unselective oxidation of the <b>carbons</b> <b>in</b> the 1 - to 4 -positions, i.e., <b>carbons</b> <b>in</b> the outer ring, gives ketone (1, 4 -anthraquinone) and anhydride (2, 3 -naphthalic anhydride and pyromellitic anhydride) species as by-products [33]. The production of small quantities of phthalic anhydride, maleic anhydride, CO and CO 2 has also been reported [16, 33, 34]. The higher selectivity of the oxidation reaction can be {{explained in terms of}} the Clar formalism [35], noting that in anthracene additional stabilization of the outermost rings can be achieved if the π-electrons on the 9, 10 -positions are more localized.|$|R
5|$|When steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a {{eutectoid}} steel), are cooled, the austenitic phase (FCC) of {{the mixture}} attempts {{to revert to}} the ferrite phase (BCC). The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite, leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with {{a small percentage of}} <b>carbon</b> <b>in</b> solution. The two, ferrite and cementite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called pearlite, named for its resemblance to mother of pearl. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon), the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the austenite grain boundaries until the percenage of <b>carbon</b> <b>in</b> the grains has decreased to the eutectoid composition (0.8% carbon), at which point the pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% carbon (hypoeutectoid), ferrite will first form within the grains until the remaining composition rises to 0.8% of carbon, at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in hypoeuctoid steel. The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.|$|E
5|$|A {{much larger}} star, however, is massive {{enough to create}} {{temperatures}} and pressures needed to cause the <b>carbon</b> <b>in</b> the core to begin to fuse when the star contracts {{at the end of}} the helium-burning stage. The cores of these massive stars become layered like onions as progressively heavier atomic nuclei build up at the center, with an outermost layer of hydrogen gas, surrounding a layer of hydrogen fusing into helium, surrounding a layer of helium fusing into carbon via the triple-alpha process, surrounding layers that fuse to progressively heavier elements. As a star this massive evolves, it undergoes repeated stages where fusion in the core stops, and the core collapses until the pressure and temperature are sufficient to begin the next stage of fusion, reigniting to halt collapse.|$|E
5|$|Boron {{is similar}} to <b>carbon</b> <b>in</b> its {{capability}} to form stable covalently bonded molecular networks. Even nominally disordered (amorphous) boron contains regular boron icosahedra which are, however, bonded randomly to each other without long-range order. Crystalline boron is a very hard, black material with a melting point of above 2000°C. It forms four major polymorphs: α-rhombohedral and β-rhombohedral (α-R and β-R), γ and β-tetragonal (β-T); α-tetragonal phase also exists (α-T), but {{is very difficult to}} produce without significant contamination. Most of the phases are based on B12 icosahedra, but the γ-phase can be described as a rocksalt-type arrangement of the icosahedra and B2 atomic pairs. It can be produced by compressing other boron phases to 12–20GPa and heating to 1500–1800°C; it remains stable after releasing the temperature and pressure. The T phase is produced at similar pressures, but higher temperatures of 1800–2200°C. As to the α and β phases, they might both coexist at ambient conditions with the β phase being more stable. Compressing boron above 160GPa produces a boron phase with an as yet unknown structure, and this phase is a superconductor at temperatures 6–12 K. Borospherene (fullerene-like B40) molecules) and borophene (proposed graphene-like structure) have been described in 2014.|$|E
