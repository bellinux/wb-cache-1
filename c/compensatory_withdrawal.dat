40|$|This {{research}} examines two seemingly apposed formulations {{concerning the}} interplay of distance and intimacy in interpersonal relationships. Jourard has proposed a distance match-ing hypothesis where decreases in distance, such as an approach towards intimacy by one per-son, are seen as invitations toward matching or reciprocation through increased self-disclo-sure in another. Supporting this, Jourard and Friedman (1970) report positive relationships between interviewer touching and self-disclosure and subsequent respondent self-disclosure, and Reese and Whitman (1962) found positive effects for interviewer smiling and non-verbal approach on disclosure. Argyle and Dean (1965) have proposed a contrasting distance equilibrium hypothesis: Decreases in distance (e. g., moving toward physical closeness, increased eye-contact, or con-versational intimacy) by one person are seen as eliciting <b>compensatory</b> <b>withdrawal</b> by another to restore overall equilibrium. Supporting this, these investigators report negative relat-ionships between eye-contact and physical proximity; Exline, Gray and Schuette (1965) show negative effects of topic intimacy on eye-contact, and even Jourard and Friedman (1970) have shown that eye-contact inhibits self-disclosure...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEpidermal {{growth factor}} {{receptor}} (EGFR) signaling is strongly implicated in glioblastoma (GBM) tumorigenesis. However, molecular agents targeting EGFR have demonstrated minimal efficacy in clinical trials, suggesting {{the existence of}} GBM resistance mechanisms. GBM cells with stem-like properties (CSCs) are highly efficient at tumor initiation and exhibit therapeutic resistance. In this study, GBMCSC lines showed sphere-forming and tumor initiation capacity after EGF withdrawal from cell culture media, compared with normal neural stem cells that rapidly perished after EGF <b>withdrawal.</b> <b>Compensatory</b> activation of related ERBB family receptors (ERBB 2 and ERBB 3) was observed in GBM CSCs deprived of EGFR signal (EGF deprivation or cetuximab inhibition), suggesting an intrinsic GBM resistance mechanism for EGFR-targeted therapy. Dual inhibition of EGFR and ERBB 2 with lapatinib significantly reduced GBM proliferation in colony formation assays compared to cetuximab-mediated EGFR-specific inhibition. Phosphorylation of downstream ERBB signaling components (AKT, ERK 1 / 2) and GBM CSC proliferation were inhibited by lapatinib. Collectively, these findings show that GBM therapeutic resistance to EGFR inhibitors {{may be explained by}} compensatory activation of EGFR-related family members (ERBB 2, ERBB 3) enabling GBM CSC proliferation, and therefore simultaneous blockade of multiple ERBB family members may be required for more efficacious GBM therapy...|$|R
