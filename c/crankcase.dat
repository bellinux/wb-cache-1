5|$|The Straight Eight was {{the first}} car in series {{production}} in the United States with a straight-eight engine. The engine had a cast iron block, a detachable cast iron cylinder head, and an aluminum lower <b>crankcase</b> and oil pan. The crankshaft ran in three main bearings. While the prototype Straight Eight shown at the model's introduction had horizontal valves of the type used in earlier Duesenberg-designed marine and racing engines, the model that entered production had a shaft-driven single overhead camshaft which used rockers to operate two valves per cylinder in a hemispheric combustion chamber.|$|E
50|$|Cylinder {{blocks and}} <b>crankcases</b> are often cast made of {{aluminium}} alloys.|$|R
5000|$|... 90-degree, {{water-cooled}} two-cylinder two-stroke V-Twin style V engine (separate <b>crankcases,</b> single in-line crankshaft) ...|$|R
2500|$|They were {{suffering}} overheating and engine failure {{which led to}} railcars 20 to 30 minute late every 2 or 3 days and frequent internal fires and external fires on surrounding farmland and foliage, due to excessive carbon in the exhaust emissions (notably on the steep West Coast lines and the [...] 1/35 Elevation, Scargill and Dashwood banks [...] on the Picton line) and they suffered from faults of poor manufacture by sub contractors. The <b>crankcases</b> were {{not strong enough to}} absorb the power of the two 210hp Fiat engines that drove the railcars. Ten of the Drewry railcars had wrecked <b>crankcases</b> [...] and blown motors a number of extra replacement motors and <b>crankcases</b> had to ordered in 1956-7 and in 1958-59 Fiat staff and fitters from Italy came to New Zealand and essentially rebuilt the engines and power systems of all the railcars.|$|R
5|$|The Wrights {{wrote to}} several engine manufacturers, but none met {{their need for}} a {{sufficiently}} lightweight powerplant. They turned to their shop mechanic, Charlie Taylor, who built an engine in just six weeks in close consultation with the brothers. To keep the weight low enough, the engine block was cast from aluminum, a rare practice for the time. The Wright/Taylor engine had a primitive version of a carburetor, and had no fuel pump. Gasoline was gravity-fed from the fuel tank mounted on a wing strut into a chamber next to the cylinders where it was mixed with air: the fuel-air mixture was then vaporized by heat from the <b>crankcase,</b> forcing it into the cylinders.|$|E
25|$|The Packard X-2775 (company {{designation}} A-2775) was an American experimental liquid-cooled aircraft engine. The {{engine was}} constructed {{as a single}} <b>crankcase</b> with four banks of six cylinders in what is close to an X-configuration. The engine was an upright 60 degree vee-12 and an inverted 60 degree vee-12 sharing a common <b>crankcase.</b> Although technically incorrect, the engine has been characterized as two Packard 1A-1500 V-12 engines coupled with a mutual <b>crankcase.</b>|$|E
25|$|Aluminium-alloy casting {{fitted to}} rear of <b>crankcase.</b> Carries the supercharger; and houses drives to the supercharger, {{auxiliary}} gearbox coupling, engine speed indicator, airscrew constant-speed unit, intercooler pump and fuel pump, {{as well as}} the oil and coolant pumps in the lower half <b>crankcase.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{technical}} developments during this period appear to be down to Alec Plint, who is named as applicant on 5 Stuart Turner patents which include sealing <b>crankcases,</b> padding <b>crankcases</b> to improve compression, variable speed gears, and decompression devices. The 1911 patent diagrams show the current 2-stroke to be '2-port', i.e. with the inlet being by non-return valve into the transfer port, with ball races for the main bearings and deflector type piston. The inlet non-return valve {{is the subject of}} another Stuart Turner patent in 1911, naming Ernest Masters as co-applicant.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Desmo Quattro was {{an experimental}} 748 cc 4 valve racer (seen at the Bol d'Or in 1986) and used 750 F1 Pantah <b>crankcases.</b> Bordi collaborated with Cosworth {{to develop the}} heads, but in the time they had, they were only able to reduce the included valve angle of the desmodromic engine to 40°, while less than 30° was possible with valve springs. Ducati stuck with the desmodromics. The subsequent 851 road bike had stronger <b>crankcases,</b> while the heads and valves remained the same; designed to fit above the 88 mm bore of a 748 cc version.|$|R
25|$|Otherwise the HM 500 {{continued}} the typical Hirth use of built-up crankshafts and roller-bearings for crankshaft & connecting rods (Hirth patents) {{as well as}} magnesium-alloy <b>crankcases</b> which made Hirth engines so popular in the 1930s.|$|R
25|$|On some Wankel engines the sump oil remains {{uncontaminated}} by {{the combustion}} process, so no oil changes are required. The {{oil in the}} mainshaft is totally sealed from the combustion process. The oil for Apex seals and <b>crankcase</b> lubrication is separate. In piston engines the <b>crankcase</b> oil is contaminated by combustion blow-by through the piston rings.|$|E
25|$|Lubricating oil was {{mechanically}} pumped through cast-in {{channels in}} the <b>crankcase</b> {{to all the}} crankshaft bearings. The camshaft was contained in an oil tight sleeve.|$|E
25|$|Infineum, a {{joint venture}} with Royal Dutch Shell, is {{manufacturing}} and marketing <b>crankcase</b> lubricant additives, fuel additives, and specialty lubricant additives, as well as automatic transmission fluids, gear oils, and industrial oils.|$|E
25|$|At high {{temperatures}} and pressures, the oxygen in air-pressurized <b>crankcases,</b> {{or in the}} working gas of hot air engines, can combine with the engine's lubricating oil and explode. At least one person has died in such an explosion.|$|R
5000|$|... {{capture of}} fine {{metallic}} particles in lubricating oils (<b>crankcases</b> of internal combustion engines, also gearboxes and differentials), {{so as to}} keep said particles out of circulation, thereby rendering them unable to cause abrasive wear of moving machine parts ...|$|R
50|$|In 2006, {{a second}} plant {{was built in}} {{partnership}} with the Velotrans firm, in Zhukovka in Bryansk Oblast. This plant is equipped to produce aluminum <b>crankcases.</b> The company plans to expand this plant to increase its production of ATVs.|$|R
25|$|In 1924, Vittorio Jano {{created his}} first straight-eight-cylinder engine for Alfa Romeo, the 1987cc P2, with common <b>crankcase</b> and four plated-steel {{two-cylinder}} blocks, {{which won the}} first World Championship ever in 1925. Although it was a straight-8, the 8C designation was not used.|$|E
25|$|The alloys were {{in limited}} use for {{aircraft}} by 1929, {{being used in}} the Rolls-Royce R engine that was successful in the Schneider Trophy seaplane races. They quickly spread to other manufacturers, in 1931 being adopted by ABC for their Hornet engine. R.R.50 alloy was used for the <b>crankcase,</b> R.R.53 for the pistons.|$|E
25|$|The {{design was}} held {{together}} by a two-part cast aluminium <b>crankcase.</b> The two pieces formed {{the upper and lower}} halves of the completed assembly and were held together with a series of bolts running around the outside perimeter. As was common for the era, the cylinders were separately formed from forged steel tubes with thin metal jackets surrounding them to provide cooling water flow.|$|E
50|$|The BSA C15G was {{produced}} from 1966 to 1967 {{and was the}} last version of the C15 engine with the ball bearing timing side main bearing, roller drive side and strengthened <b>crankcases,</b> larger oil pump and needle roller gearbox layshaft bearings.|$|R
50|$|In 1991 the liquid-cooled 907IE was {{released}} with Weber-Marelli fuel injection. Early {{in the model}} run the <b>crankcases</b> were strengthened, after some cracking in racing use. These had 17 in wheels, and four piston Brembo brake calipers. The 907IE ended production in 1992.|$|R
50|$|A racing version, the Type 50B, {{was also}} produced. It shared the 5.0 L 2-valve engine but was blown to produce 470 hp (350 kW). It was used from 1937 through 1939. A pair of these engines were {{installed}} in the Bugatti P100 airplane, with specially cast magnesium <b>crankcases.</b>|$|R
25|$|Produced from 1941 to 1945, the V-770 {{featured}} a two-piece aluminum alloy <b>crankcase,</b> steel barreled cylinders with integral aluminum alloy fins and aluminum alloy heads. The V-770 {{was the only}} American inverted V12-type inline air-cooled engine to reach production. The engine was used in very few Army Air Forces aircraft, among them the short lived Fairchild AT-21 twin-engine bomber trainer, and in the two Bell XP-77 light-weight fighter prototypes.|$|E
25|$|The Kestrel {{came about}} {{as a result of}} the {{excellent}} Curtiss D-12, one of the first truly successful cast-block engines. Earlier designs had used individually machined steel cylinders that were screwed onto a <b>crankcase,</b> whereas the cast-block design used a single block of aluminium that was machined to form cylinders. The result was both simpler to build as well as lighter and much stronger, requiring only an investment in new machining equipment.|$|E
25|$|Most radial engines use {{overhead}} poppet valves {{driven by}} pushrods and lifters on a cam plate which is concentric with the crankshaft, {{with a few}} smaller radials, like the Kinner B-5 and Russian Shvetsov M-11, using individual camshafts within the <b>crankcase</b> for each cylinder. A few engines use sleeve valves such as the 14-cylinder Bristol Hercules and the 18-cylinder Bristol Centaurus, which are quieter and smoother running but require much tighter manufacturing tolerances.|$|E
5000|$|BSA {{developed}} an increased capacity 441 cc model, marketed as the BSA B44 Shooting Star and the BSA Victor Special. Following development work in producing Jeff Smith's works B40-based Victor, from 1966 onwards the C15 bottom-end (<b>crankcases,</b> bearings, oil pump with circulation system and gearbox components) was similarly upgraded.|$|R
5000|$|The 996 cc engine had larger 98 mm (3.9 inch) pistons, larger valves, a {{stronger}} crankshaft and <b>crankcases</b> from the 916 SPS. But the 916 camshaft gave a softer, less peaky power delivery and less top-end power: Output was 83.5 kW (112 bhp) as against the SPS’s 92.4 kW (124 bhp) ...|$|R
50|$|For the 1981 {{season the}} KR500 was improved, a new chassis was built which was stiffer and lighter, with {{magnesium}} <b>crankcases</b> and anti-dive front forks. The season saw the KR500 get its first podium finishes with two third places (in Netherlands and Finland) with Ballington finishing 8th {{in the final}} standings of the championship.|$|R
25|$|The engine's design {{concentrated}} on the reduction of moving parts. The cooling fan and dynamo were built integrally with the one-piece crankshaft, removing the need for drive belts. The use of gaskets, seen as another potential weak point for failure and leaks, was also kept to a minimum. The cylinder heads are mated to the cylinder barrels by lapped joints with extremely fine tolerances, as are {{the two halves of}} the <b>crankcase</b> and other surface-to-surface joints.|$|E
25|$|In 1922, Duff {{sold the}} S.61 {{and focused on}} making Mephistopheles faster and more reliable. Harry Ricardo made a set of {{aluminum}} pistons and raised the engine’s compression ratio. In May, Duff finished third in Brooklands’ 100Mile Handicap. In its next race, one of the Fiat’s engine blocks detached from the <b>crankcase.</b> When the engine blew, the hood was torn off the car, just missing Duff’s head. Engine parts rained down on the track. Duff sold the car for scrap.|$|E
25|$|Most {{vehicles}} existing {{today have}} been serviced by GM {{during one of}} the safety recalls on the car. For the fire-related recall, shields and drip-trays were added to prevent leaking fluids from contacting hot surfaces. The presence of drip shields between the engine block and the exhaust manifold are a clue that the car has been retrofitted. The addition of the longer AC Delco PF51 oil filter and a re-calibrated dipstick added extra oil capacity to the oiling system, and enabled running four quarts of oil in the <b>crankcase</b> instead of three, to help prevent oil starvation to the rods. Certain vehicles also had their connecting rods or entire block replaced.|$|E
40|$|Summary. The {{aim of this}} {{elaboration}} was {{an attempt}} to determine a mathematical description of a blow-by phenomenon to engine <b>crankcases</b> for various types of engines on the basis of many years of the author’s previous work. An effect of basic constructional and operational parameters on the value of the blow-by intensity was considered...|$|R
50|$|Most {{flywheel}} engine production ceased in the 1940s, but modern {{engines of}} this kind remain in use for applications where the low speed is desirable, mostly in oil field applications such as pumpjacks. Maintenance {{is less of a}} problem with modern flywheel engines than older ones due to their enclosed <b>crankcases</b> and more advanced materials.|$|R
50|$|In 1986 the 750 F1 <b>crankcases</b> were strengthened, and {{now used}} {{straight}} cut primary gears, and a stronger gearbox. The valve sizes were increased to 41 mm and 35 mm, as {{used on the}} TT2, and this meant smaller 12 mm sparkplugs were fitted. Other features were 40 mm Forcella front forks, Veglia instruments, and a steel petrol tank.|$|R
