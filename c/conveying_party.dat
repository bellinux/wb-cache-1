50|$|Although {{in theory}} Czechoslovakia {{remained}} a multiparty state, in actuality the Communists were in complete control. Political participation became subject to KSČ approval. The KSČ also prescribed percentage representation for non-Marxist parties. The National Assembly, purged of dissidents, became a mere rubber stamp for KSČ programs. In 1953, an inner cabinet of the National Assembly, the Presidium, was created. Composed of KSČ leaders, the Presidium served to <b>convey</b> <b>party</b> policies through government channels. Regional, district, and local committees were subordinated to the Ministry of Interior. Slovak autonomy was constrained; the KSS was reunited with the KSČ but retained its own identity.|$|R
50|$|The line {{celebrated its}} centenary in 1904, {{producing}} a special commemorative brochure for the occasion. Two years previously, a notable experiment {{had been carried}} out, namely the introduction of battery-powered 'accumulator' cars. These were not a success, {{but one of the}} cars was retained after the electrical equipment had been stripped out and used to <b>convey</b> <b>parties</b> of visiting dignitaries, including King Edward VII when he and his consort, Queen Alexandra, visited Swansea for the ceremonial cutting of the first sod of the King's Dock in July 1904. The car was used again for the visit of King Edward's successor, King George V, in 1920, when he officiated {{at the opening of the}} Queen's Dock.|$|R

40|$|How {{effective}} are candidate, party, {{and interest}} group ads at conveying noticeable differ-ences between the Democratic and Republican Parties? Or at boosting preferences for the par-ties? There are two conflicting expectations; first, that ads from these three sponsors {{will have the}} same effect on citizen perceptions, under the assumption that viewers do not notice spon-sorship. The second expectation is that party ads have a stronger effect on perceived party differences (that is, at “building the party image”) than candidate and group ads. There have been very few empirical investigations into these common claims, however. I leverage a com-prehensive dataset that tracks political ads in the nation’s top media markets on surveys of U. S. voters in 2000 and 2004. The results demonstrate that sponsorship does matter, but not in ways that confirm the second expectation. When ads <b>convey</b> <b>party</b> distinctions, the effect comes from candidate ads (and to a lesser extent, from interest group ads); to that effect, party-sponsored ads almost never matter. 1...|$|R
50|$|The Soviet {{newspaper}} industry {{began in}} the underground movements that created Pravda, meaning 'truth', which on 5 May 1912 was published as a political newspaper. Pravda did not start as a political publication, but instead was a journal on social life.

50|$|The {{televised}} party leaders' {{debate is}} often {{regarded as the}} turning point of the campaign. During the event, McLeod further alienated many voters with an overly aggressive performance. Harris used his time to speak directly to the camera to <b>convey</b> his <b>party's</b> Common Sense Revolution platform, virtually ignoring all questions asked of him by Rae and McLeod and avoiding getting caught up in their debate. Since Liberal support was regarded by many political insiders as soft and unsteady, many voters who were previously leaning to the Liberals shifted to the Progressive Conservatives after the debate.|$|R
60|$|All {{this had}} made some delay, {{and it was almost}} the end of the long vacation.

Subscription to the newspaper became compulsory for all phalangist members in 1966. Following {{the control of the}} party by the Lebanese Forces, namely Elie Hobeika and Samir Geagea, the paper also began to be controlled by the forces in 1986.

First they visit the oracle Pythia at Delphi, who confirms they are to remove the statue, but not its female companion (Proserpina). When they reach King Scydrothemis at Sinope, they find him reluctant to part with the statue. The god then leaves the temple of his own will and <b>conveys</b> the <b>party</b> back to Alexandria, where a new temple is established at Rhacotis—the historical site of a temple to Serapis and Isis.|$|R
60|$|As Mr. Hunt {{would have}} to abandon his boats at this place, Mr. Lisa now offered to {{purchase}} them, and such of his merchandise as was superfluous, and to pay him in horses to be obtained at a fort belonging to the Missouri Fur Company, situated at the Mandan villages, about {{a hundred and fifty}} miles further up the river. A bargain was promptly made, and Mr. Lisa and Mr. Crooks, with several companions, set out for the fort to procure the horses. They returned, after upwards of a fortnight's absence, bringing with them the stipulated number of horses. Still the cavalry was not sufficiently numerous to <b>convey</b> the <b>party</b> and baggage and merchandise, and a few days more were required to complete the arrangements for the journey.|$|R

There is no discussion on the generalization of the phenomena related to dominant conceptions on politics, derived from the liberal conservative hegemony, that <b>conveys</b> political <b>parties</b> to parliamentary practices that are functional to governable democracy. In this liberal conservative democracy model, the parliament has the function to stop the ones who represent the wider group of social interest from modifying public policies, in favor of capitalist interests that result {{in an increase in}} poverty and exclusion. This is why political parties go through a representation crisis, which also affects many left wing parties. This article analyses the way critics from other left wing sectors also fail in overcoming dominant ideological parameters, even if that was their intention...|$|R

A noticeable share of this generated data traffic is used to <b>convey</b> third <b>party</b> advertisement, or to collect information about the user and its phone, generally with the target of profiling users.

In this paper we propose Data-Sluice, a framework for Android devices which dynamically controls the connections opened by apps, enforcing fine grained policies designed to stop advertisement from altering the user experience, avoiding private data leakage and removing or strongly reducing the data traffic overhead. We apply Data-Sluice {{to a set of}} popular Android apps to analyze the generated traffic and removing the data overhead. Furthermore, we exploit Data-Sluice to successfully stop the action of a set of malicious apps...|$|R
50|$|As the use {{of motor}} {{vehicles}} expanded in Queensland from the 1920s, Eimeo beach and the Eimeo Hotel, easily accessed from Mackay by road, gained in popularity with both local residents and tourists as recreation venues. The Queensland Government Intelligence and Tourist Bureau's 1929 publication The Mackay District, North Queensland (2nd edition pp29, 31) confirms this popularity and suggests that the Mango Avenue trees were well established by the late 1920s:"In close proximity to Mackay are many splendid beaches. Some of them are beautifully situated, surrounded by coconut palms, and reached through avenues of mango trees. The two most popular seaside resorts are Eimeo and Slade Point. Both of these are within easy motoring distance. Eimeo is about 9 miles north-west of Mackay, and can easily be reached by motor-car in half an hour. The drive to Eimeo is interesting all the way. At Eimeo there is a comfortable hotel, where every {{attention is paid to}} visitors. The hotel is situated on a beautiful headland, and commands charming views on all sides. The grounds of the hotel are extensive and well laid out with many varieties of fruit trees, while the approach thereto is laid out with stately coconut palms. Excellent shooting and fishing may be enjoyed here, and a motor-boat is available for <b>conveying</b> <b>parties</b> around one or other of the beautiful bays in this vicinity."In late 1932 title to the hotel site, on a reduced parcel of just under 9 acres (3.6 hectares), was transferred to Mrs Lavinia Walters, who demolished the building and constructed a new Eimeo Hotel in 1934, using some of the materials from the demolition. She purchased an old Anglican parish hall and moved it to the site to form an annex, and built an open-air dance floor and skating rink on the property. She is credited with being instrumental in having a bitumen road built between Eimeo and Mackay in 1938.|$|R
50|$|The League of Free Liberals (in Dutch: Bond van Vrije Liberalen) was a Dutch {{classical}} liberal {{political party}} and a predecessor of the Liberal State Party which is historically linked to the VVD, the major Dutch liberal party.

The conservative liberals were called free liberals before they had founded a separate party.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Boardman {{lived on}} into the year 1831, and welcomed a new arrival from America, Francis Mason and his wife, on the 23rd of January, and a week later set out to {{introduce}} the former to the Karens, a band of whom had come down to <b>convey</b> the <b>party.</b> Mr. Boardman was carried on his bed, his wife in a chair, and {{on the third day}} they reached a spot where the Karens, of their own accord, had erected a bamboo chapel beside a beautiful stream beneath a range of mountains. Nearly a hundred had assembled there, of whom half were candidates for baptism. They cooked, ate, and slept in the open air, but they had made a small shed for Mr. Mason, and another for the Boardmans, too small to stand upright in, and so ill-enclosed as to be exposed to sun by day and cold air by night.|$|R

25|$|By 1995, the {{governing}} New Democratic Party and incumbent Premier Bob Rae had become extremely unpopular with the electorate, {{partly due to}} the state of the Ontario economy and its record debt and deficit amidst a Canada-wide recession. Lyn McLeod's Liberals were leading in pre-election polls and were expected to benefit from the swing in support away from the NDP, but they began losing support due to several controversial policy reversals and what was generally regarded as an uninspiring campaign. The turning point in the election is often considered to be Harris' performance in the televised leaders' debate. Harris used his camera time to speak directly to the camera to <b>convey</b> his <b>party's</b> Common Sense Revolution platform. He was elected with a large majority government in the 1995 election. Roughly half of his party's seats came from the suburban belt surrounding Metro Toronto, often called the '905' for its telephone area code.|$|R
