Most scholars agree that the Aztecs, especially the inner circle around Moctezuma, were well convinced that Cortés was not a god in any shape or form.|$|E

Another hero of this war Hermenegildo Galeana is from this area and is honored each year by a cultural event called Expo-Tecpan held each April. Another important celebration is held in the Barrio de la Capilla neighborhood, which celebrates is patron saint Bartholomew the Apostle with floats, release of candlelit hot air balloons, fireworks, folk dances such as Panaderos and La Pluma finishing with an event called the Topa del Toro.|$|E

25|$|The 1909 was {{extremely}} successful for Sorolla. He {{had already been}} widely received recognized for his paintings and received awards not only in Spain but also in France and Germany, but the year 1909 was a high point in his career. On the invitation of the American art collector Archer M. Huntington, he traveled {{with his wife and}} the two older children Maria and Joaquín {{at the beginning of the}} year to New York City. Here Huntington had previously opened the Hispanic Society of America that year and in their rooms should Sorolla showed the first exhibition of his work in the United States. It was Sorolla's first trip across the Atlantic and later adjusting success unpredictable. On February 4, 1909, the opening of the exhibition took place; initially only a few visitors <b>came.</b> <b>This</b> changed gradually as very positive reviews appeared in the newspapers. When it closed on March 8 the exhibition had had a total of 169,000 visitors to see Sorolla's work. Encouraged by the overwhelming response, a slightly modified collection was also shown in Buffalo and Boston. During his stay in the United States Sorolla received 20 portrait commissions, including that of the just-elected US President William Howard Taft, whom he visited in the White House in Washington, D.C. In May 1909, as Sorolla left the United States, he had sold a total of 195 images - including two works to the Metropolitan Museum of Art - and taken in the enormous sum of 181,760 US dollars.|$|E
25|$|Before the British {{could decide}} upon a policy, however, Sukarno struck again, making an {{airborne}} assault Labis {{in the night}} of 1–2 September. Though the raid was a catastrophic failure, {{with one of the}} transport planes crashing en route, and the remainder of the troops arriving scattered with little food and battered morale, the move further infuriated the Malaysians, who in turn put pressure upon the British to act. The next day, colonial secretary Duncan Sandys authorized on-site naval commander Admiral Varyl Begg to plan for strikes against Indonesian bases in Sumatra. The British plans for retaliation were pre-empted once again, but this time by an act of their own. On August 27, the aircraft carrier HMS Victorious had sailed through the Sunda Straits without proper permission being gained from Indonesian authorities. The Indonesians, who feared that the British were attempting to provoke them into attacking the carrier as the Americans had the Vietnamese during the Gulf of Tonkin incident that had occurred earlier that month, were incensed. Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio barred the Victorious return passage through the Strait on 2 September, posing a direct challenge to the British. Officials in London determined that the challenge had to be met, and that the Victorious should return through the way it <b>came.</b> <b>This</b> stance, however, met important opposition. Washington {{did not want to be}} dragged into a military action due to the British overreaching themselves. And even more importantly, Begg himself opposed the passage, due to the inability of the Victorious to defend herself in the Strait. What became known as the Sunda Straits Crisis was peacefully resolved, after several weeks of tension, by the Indonesians offering London another strait to pass through at Lombok, that gave the Allies an out from war, and Jakarta a passage that could be easily screened by their warships. By this time, tensions were beginning to wind to a close, though more landings were attempted that December, as both sides seemed to recognize the disadvantage of fully escalating the Confrontation through any greater action.|$|E

A 2002 retrospective of Bannon's books claims [...] "there were more explicit and nuanced representations of sexuality in those paperbacks than could be found almost anywhere else". Author Suzana Danuta Walters represents the eroticism in Bannon's books {{as a form of}} rebellion. In the Harvard Gay & Lesbian Review, Jenifer Levin writes, [...] "Know this: Beebo lives.

500|$|Architecture was not {{the only}} legacy of the Normans. Rule over the peasants (there was no {{established}} middle class) was also enforced by a feudal system, unchanged since its introduction following the Norman conquest of 1071. Thus the Sicilian aristocracy had not only wealth but vast manpower at their command, something that had by this time declined in many other parts of Europe. As in Southern Spain, the huge rural estates remained almost as concentrated as when they had been Roman [...] "latifundi". The Sicilian economy, though very largely agriculturally based, was very strong, and became more so during the 18th century as shipping became more efficient and the threat of Muslim piracy died away. The export markets for lemons (for the great 18th century fashion for lemonade) and wines increased greatly, and Sicilian wheat remained, as it had been since Roman times, the backbone of the economy. The disaster that was to give Sicily its modern reputation of poverty, namely the opening-up of the American Middle West to wheat-farming, was a century away. When it <b>came,</b> <b>this</b> permanently more than halved the price of wheat, and destroyed the old economy forever.|$|E
500|$|Spector's {{role as a}} {{producer}} gave him the job of explaining the game to the publisher, which he called his [...] "biggest challenge". He explained that they [...] "didn't always get what the team was trying to do", and said, [...] "You don't {{want to know how}} many times the game <b>came</b> <b>this</b> close to being killed (or how late in the project)". According to Church, Looking Glass' internal management largely ignored System Shock, in favor of the concurrently-developed Flight Unlimited—the game [...] "that had to be the hit, because it was the self-published title". Spector organized a licensing deal between Electronic Arts and Looking Glass that gave the former the trademark to the game, but the latter the copyright. His goal was to ensure that neither party could continue the franchise without the other's involvement. While Cyberspace was originally conceived as a realistic hacking simulation—which could even be used to reimplement SHODAN's ethical constraints—it was simplified after Origin Systems deemed it too complicated. The game's star field system was written by programmer James Fleming. Marc LeBlanc was the main creator of the game's HUD, which he later believed was too complicated. He said that it was [...] "very much the Microsoft Word school of user interface", in that there was no [...] "feature that you [...] see on the screen and touch and play with".|$|E
