2500|$|Since the Chechen {{conflict}} {{began in}} 1994, cases of young veterans returning embittered and traumatized {{to their home}} towns have been reported all across Russia. Psychiatrists, law-enforcement officials, and journalists have started calling the condition of psychologically scarred soldiers [...] "Chechen syndrome" [...] (<b>CS),</b> <b>drawing</b> a parallel with the post-traumatic stress disorders suffered by Soviet soldiers who fought in Afghanistan. According to Yuri Alexandrovsky, {{deputy director of the}} Moscow Serbsky Institute in 2003, at least 70% of the estimated 1.5million Chechnya veterans suffered CS. Many of the veterans came back alcoholic, unemployable and antisocial. Thousands were also physically disabled for life and left with very limited help from the government.|$|E
