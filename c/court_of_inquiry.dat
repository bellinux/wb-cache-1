5|$|Doctors who {{conducted}} post mortems on the bodies recovered recorded that most victims {{had died of}} burns. On day four Air India's flight safety officer informed the inquiry that the aircraft's thrust lever and thrust reverse levers were both in the forward position, possibly indicating that the pilot intended to go around.

5|$|Even {{before its}} {{departure}} from India the 5th Light Infantry suffered from weak senior leadership and discord among its British officers (see details of <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> report below). To compound the problem, the sepoys themselves {{were divided into}} two major cliques. One led by the Subedar Major Khan Mohamed Khan and Subedar Wahid Ali and the other consisting of Subedar Dunde Khan, Jemedars Chisti Khan and Abdul Ali Khan. According to the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry,</b> {{as a result of these}} two factions, discipline was compromised and any side for any particular policy or measure in the regiment was at once the signal for its rejection by the other.|$|E
5|$|On 16 November 2010, {{five months}} after the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> was constituted, it {{submitted}} its report with input from the NTSB and Boeing, and stated that pilot error was the cause of the accident since the flight path was incorrect.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{military}} <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> {{into the}} massacre were held, and one found that [...] "the fire of the RIC {{was carried out}} without orders and exceeded {{the demands of the}} situation". Major General Boyd, the officer commanding Dublin District, added that in his opinion, [...] "the firing on the crowd was carried out without orders, was indiscriminate, and unjustifiable, with the exception of any shooting which took place inside the enclosure." [...] The findings <b>of</b> these <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> were suppressed by the British Government, and only came to light in 2000.|$|R
50|$|<b>Courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> are {{responsible}} for investigating all criminal cases {{in order for them}} to be judged by High <b>Courts</b> <b>of</b> Justice. In the case of smaller districts, first instance and inquiry courts are usually unified under the responsibility of one judge.|$|R
5|$|Within {{less than}} a week of the mutiny, a <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> was set up to {{investigate}} and collect evidence for the trial for the mutineers. Although the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> was meant to take place behind closed doors, as accordance with standard military procedures, the proceeding was held in public instead. According to Harper and Miller this was to give the public the impression that the mutineers “were being tried for mutiny and shooting with intent to kill and not, as alleged for refusal to go to Turkey’’. Although the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> was clearly trying to downplay the link between Turkey and the mutiny, with the declassification of new documents and evidence, another perception has emerged in explaining the cause of the mutiny and that is the role of pan-Islamism. Contrary to official British colonial authorities, the mutiny was not an isolated case of a purely local affair but was instead part of a wider anti-British and pro-Muslim battle.|$|E
5|$|On 23 February 1915, a <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> was held, {{at first}} meeting in {{confidence}} {{but then in}} public sessions. It prepared a 450-page report dated 15 May 1915. Although extensive discord amongst both officers and men of the 5th Light Infantry was identified, {{the cause of the}} mutiny was not conclusively established. The focus of the report was on possible external German influences, plus internal regimental causes of the mutiny.|$|E

5|$|According to the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry,</b> 'the prime {{cause of}} this lamentable episode' was the {{responsibility}} of Colonel Martin. Described as a ‘’loner’’ for whom officers had little respect, Martin’s primary fault {{was that he was}} too trusting, to the point of naivety. While he cared for the welfare of his men and saw that their living conditions were improved, he was described as being too much of a ‘’solder’s friend’’, to the point that other British officers found that this attitude and work ethic of Martin’s severely undermined their authority over the sepoys. Over time, that served to erode the respect that the British officers and even the sepoys had for him.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days after}} {{the start of the war}} in September 1939, Z1 Leberecht Maass and another {{destroyer}} unsuccessfully attacked Polish ships in the naval base on the Hel Peninsula. She was lightly damaged during the action. In mid-February 1940, while proceeding into the North Sea to attack British fishing trawlers (Operation Wikinger), the ship was bombed by a patrolling German bomber that damaged her steering. A <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> convened during the war determined that she and a sister ship were hit by bombs, but a post-war investigation determined that she had drifted into a newly laid British minefield. Z1 Leberecht Maass broke in half with the loss of the most of her crew.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of the 5th Light Infantry, numbering 588 sepoys plus seven British and Indian officers, left Singapore on 3 July 1915 to see active service in the Cameroons and German East Africa. They were not accompanied by Colonel Martin, who was heavily criticised by a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> and then retired from the Army. In 1922 the 5th Light Infantry was disbanded. Much the same fate befell the Malay States Guides; they were sent to Kelantan in Malaya to quell Tok Janggut's uprising at Pasir Puteh in April 1915. Afterwards the Guides were sent to fight in Africa and were disbanded in 1919.|$|E

5|$|The {{version of}} events {{recorded}} by history {{is based on the}} accounts of Burnham, Ingram and Gooding, the Matabele present at the battle (particularly inDuna Mjaan), and the men of Forbes's column. Burnham, Ingram and Gooding's stories closely corroborate each other; their {{version of events}} was accepted as true by the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> at Bulawayo in December 1893. First-hand Matabele accounts such as Mjaan's, which were first recorded during 1894, appear to confirm the character of the break-out, saying that three of the white men they were fighting—including Burnham, whom several of them recognised—left during a lull in the battle, just after Wilson withdrew to his final position.|$|E
5|$|After No.1 Long Range Flight was disbanded, Wing Commander Cuming {{returned}} to the ARDU. He was subsequently appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) on 31December 1953 for leading the flight and participating in the London-to-Christchurch air race. Squadron Leader Raw was also awarded the Air Force Cross {{for his role in}} the race, the decoration being presented to him by Queen Elizabeth II at Brisbane on 10March 1954. Raw had assumed command of No.2 Squadron on 18December; this was the first RAAF squadron to be equipped with Canberra bombers. Flight Lieutenant Francis Noel Davies, who had been Raw's co-pilot during the race, and two other airmen were killed on 16June 1954 when A84-202 crashed near Amberley. Wing Commander Cuming presided over the four-man <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> which investigated the cause of this accident. As of May 2011, A84-201 was a gate guard at RAAF Base Amberley.|$|E
5|$|After {{the loss}} of G-ALYV, the Central Government of India convened a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> to examine {{the cause of the}} accident. Professor Natesan Srinivasan joined the inquiry as the main {{technical}} expert. A large portion of the aircraft was recovered and reassembled at Farnborough, during which the break-up was found to have begun with a left elevator spar failure in the stabilizer. The inquiry concluded that the aircraft had encountered extreme negative G forces during takeoff; severe turbulence generated by adverse weather was determined to have induced down-loading, leading to {{the loss of}} the wings. Examination of the cockpit controls suggested that the pilot may have inadvertently over-stressed the aircraft when pulling out of a steep dive by over-manipulation of the fully powered flight controls. Investigators did not consider metal fatigue as a contributory cause.|$|E

5|$|He was unfortunate {{again on}} 22 April 1943 when, {{in command of}} Camilla on an RAAF {{contract}} involving the transport of military personnel to Port Moresby, he found himself unable to proceed due to bad weather, {{and was forced to}} attempt a night landing on the open ocean when off the coast of New Guinea. Due largely to the inexperience of his co-pilot, the aircraft broke up on landing, and 13 out of the 31 people on board did not survive. Koch spent about 18 hours in the sea before being rescued at the chance passage of a local steamer. A. B. Corbett, the Director-General of Civil Aviation, recommended to his Minister that in view of the circumstances no <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> be held—in effect Koch was exonerated.|$|E
5|$|In early 1934, {{the ship}} and her crew were {{featured}} in a James Cagney film for Warner Brothers, Here Comes the Navy, which made extensive use of exterior footage as well as on-board location shots. In the early morning of 26 July, Arizona collided with a fishing trawler, Umatilla, that was under tow by another trawler off Cape Flattery. Two men aboard the Umatilla {{were killed in the}} collision and the Navy convened a <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> to investigate the incident. The court recommended that the ship's captain, Captain MacGillivray Milne, be court-martialed. This took place at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, while the ship was participating in that year's Fleet Problem off the East Coast. Milne was judged guilty and replaced several months later by Captain George Baum after the ship returned to the West Coast. In the meantime, Rear Admiral Samuel W. Bryant assumed command of Battleship Division Two on 4 September, with Arizona as his flagship.|$|E
