2500|$|Automixers can be {{oriented}} toward live reinforcement application or permanent installation {{with varying degrees}} of <b>connector</b> <b>type</b> (XLR or block) and feature switches and channel potentiometers located internally or externally. Channel switches permit the user to vary sensitivity (dynamic mic, condenser mic, or line), phantom power, priority, and always on-or-auto mode ("on" [...] being useful for uninterrupted music playback). Auto mixers are frequently configured in board rooms, but are also useful in theatrical and [...] "town hall" [...] events where several wireless microphones are in use. Auto mixers may be connected directly to wired mics and wireless mic receivers, or may be connected to the channel direct output or send jacks of a mixing console. Integration of an auto mixer with manual mixing console permits more precise input gain control, absolute mic muting, low cut filter, equalization and individual mic channel foldback control.|$|E

40|$|During {{architectural}} design, {{the architect}} {{has to come}} up with architectural structures and tactics that aim at the fulfillment of quality attribute requirements. Architectural structures are built from component and <b>connector</b> <b>types</b> that define how components are supposed to interact. Since <b>connector</b> <b>types</b> typically impact big portions of a system, tactics usually crosscut connector designs and demand for modularized treatment during architecture design. The synthesis of tactics within connector designs, however, {{turns out to be a}} major challenge. This is due to the fact that they are likely to affect each other in the final system where they need to be mutually integrated. This mutual affection is called tactic interaction. In this paper, we describe an approach towards detecting such tactic interactions during connector design. Our approach is integrated in a commercial architecture design tool supporting interaction-sensitive synthesis of architectural tactics during connector design activities...|$|R
