Efforts to treat fevers are also recommended. Nimodipine, a <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blocker,</b> is frequently used to prevent vasospasm.

5|$|The use {{of calcium}} channel blockers, {{thought to be}} able to prevent the spasm of blood vessels by {{preventing}} calcium from entering smooth muscle cells, has been proposed for prevention. The <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blocker</b> nimodipine when taken by mouth improves outcome if given between the fourth and twenty-first day after the bleeding, even if it does not reduce the amount of vasospasm detected on angiography. In traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine does not affect long-term outcome, and is not recommended. Other calcium channel blockers and magnesium sulfate have been studied, but are not presently recommended; neither is there any evidence that shows benefit if nimodipine is given intravenously.|$|E

40|$|The {{advancing}} chronic {{renal failure}} is at most the consequence of secondary haemodynamic and metabolic factors as intraglomerular hypertension and glomerular hypertrophy. Although tight blood pressure control is the major preventive mechanism for progressive renal failure, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have some other renoprotective mechanisms beyond the blood pressure control. That is why these two groups of antihypertensive drugs traditionally have advantages in treating renal patients especially those with proteinuria over 400 - 1000 mg/day. Even if earlier experimental studies have shown renoprotective effect of <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers,</b> later clinical studies did not prove that <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> have any advantages in renal protection over ACE inhibitors given as monotherapy or in combination with ACE inhibitors. It was explained by action of <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> on afferent but not on efferent glomerular arterioles; a well known mechanism that leads to intraglomerular hypertension. New generations of dihydropiridine <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> can dilate even efferent arterioles not causing unfavorable haemodynamic disturbances. This finding was confirmed in clinical studies which showed that renoprotection established by <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> was not inferior to that of ACE inhibitors and that <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> and ACE inhibitors have additive effect on renoprotection. Newer generation of dihydropiridine <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> seem to offer more therapeutic possibilities in renoprotection by their dual action on afferent and efferent glomerular arterioles and, possibly by other effects beyond the blood pressure control...|$|R

Methods: Standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Pregnancy and Childbirth Review Group were used. All published and unpublished randomised trials in which <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> were used for tocolysis for women in preterm labour between 20 and 36 weeks’ gestation, were considered. Main results: The systematic review includes 12 randomised controlled trials {{with a total of}} 1029 participating women.

40|$|Role of <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> in the future, {{in view of}} the INSIGHT Study. The {{data from}} The International Nifedipine Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension Treatment (INSIGHT) Study {{indicate}} that effectively reducing blood pressure can decrease the incidence of cardiovascular events in high risk patients with concomitant pathology, including diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, as well as in smokers and those with poor family history. Old and new antihypertensive drugs were similar in preventing cardiovascular mortality as major events. The glomerular filtration rate of patients on co-amilozide went down compared to those on nifedipine. Metabolic parameters, as expected, were not disturbed during treatment with <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers,</b> in contrast to the high-dose diuretic-treated population. Ankle edema induced by nifedipine was very disturbing. It can be concluded that overall <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> are neither better nor worse than conventional therapy, allowing for possible small differences in stroke (advantage to <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers)</b> and myocardial infarction (advantage to diuretics).
