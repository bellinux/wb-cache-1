500|$|Emeco's {{chairs are}} {{manufactured}} by hand in Hanover, Pennsylvania through a two-week, 77-step process. Eames Demetrios, {{the grandson of}} designer Charles Eames, published a documentary film on the manufacturing process called [...] "77 Steps." [...] Many believe the chair is cast from a single form, but it is actually welded together from 12 pieces. Sheets of aluminum are rolled into tubes, <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>length,</b> and bent into shapes on large hydraulic machines. Various notches and punchouts are made so pieces can fit together before welding. Workers grind down the welding joints {{to give it a}} smooth finish, creating the appearance of being cast from a single piece. The chair goes through a repeated heating and cooling cycle that increases the strength of the aluminum. The chairs are also anodized. Originally swivel chair bases and other parts were purchased from a supplier, but in the 1950s, Emeco began purchasing manufacturing equipment to manufacture them in-house.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Fuller {{began the}} Otisco Project, named after its {{location}} in Otisco, New York. The project developed and demonstrated concrete spray with mesh-covered wireforms for producing large-scale, load-bearing spanning structures built on-site, {{without the use}} of pouring molds, other adjacent surfaces or hoisting. The initial method used a circular concrete footing in which anchor posts were set. Tubes <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>length</b> and with ends flattened were then bolted together to form a duodeca-rhombicahedron (22-sided hemisphere) geodesic structure with spans ranging to [...] The form was then draped with layers of ¼-inch wire mesh attached by twist ties. Concrete was sprayed onto the structure, building up a solid layer which, when cured, would support additional concrete to be added by a variety of traditional means. Fuller referred to these buildings as monolithic ferroconcrete geodesic domes. However, the tubular frame form proved problematic for setting windows and doors. It was replaced by an iron rebar set vertically in the concrete footing and then bent inward and welded in place to create the dome's wireform structure and performed satisfactorily. Domes up to three stories tall built with this method proved to be remarkably strong. Other shapes such as cones, pyramids and arches proved equally adaptable.|$|E

5000|$|The [...]220 Swift {{cartridge}} can be {{made into}} a passable [...]303 Savage cartridge, as they are very close in most dimensions, and after forming the [...]220 Swift is easily <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> proper <b>length.</b>|$|R
30|$|The wood fibers were {{recovered}} from industrial waste, the fibers were washed {{in hot water}} (50  °C) to remove surface residues, such as a mucilage extraction process, and <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> the <b>length</b> of 40  μm.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{a temper}} mill {{installation}} includes a re-coil line where {{the finished product}} is a coil instead of bundles of cut lengths of product. Maximum product flexibility capability could be attained if the installation was arranged to produce both coils and bundles of <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>length</b> product.|$|E
50|$|Engineered lumber is <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>length</b> and {{installed}} similar to sawn lumber; the flitch requires shop fabrication and/or field bolting. This {{coupled with a}} much increased self weight of the beam (11.4 lb for engineered wood vs. 25.2 lb for a flitch beam) decreases {{the viability of the}} system.|$|E
50|$|Larger, {{general purpose}} mills {{typically}} comprised three circular saws and a docker. The initial break-down {{of the log}} was usually carried out at the Canadian bench (the largest circular saw). Further sizing was carried out at number one and two benches and the planks were <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>length</b> at the docker.|$|E
50|$|The sawmill is {{a highly}} intact example of a small sawmill {{originally}} established to produce timber for packaging cases. The layout {{and all of the}} components typically found in a small mill of the 1950s remain including: the characteristic open-sided shed, early electrical insulators tracing the route of the original cabling, breakdown (Canadian) saw, number one and two saw benches, docking saw, original hand operated winch, rails and trolleys. The milling operation continues to follow the traditional packing case sequence of initial cut at the breakdown (Canadian) saw, sizing at the number one and two benches and <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>lengths</b> at the docker.|$|R

It has a more robust chain, and a higher power output than any saw that can be carried by a human.|$|R
30|$|The {{crown of}} each tooth was removed {{perpendicular}} to the long axis of the tooth using a flexible diamond disc at low speed (n. 7020 – KG Sorensen, Barueri, SP, Brazil) and under water cooling. All roots were <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> a <b>length</b> of 13  mm (Figure  1 A).|$|R
50|$|Besides the {{grinding}} wheel, {{the machine is}} hand powered on all axes. The machine may be used <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> die punches <b>to</b> <b>length</b> or <b>to</b> perform grinding operations such as grinding flats or other shapes on punches etc.|$|R
5000|$|... 1950s & 1960s—Brady {{moved to}} Milwaukee, {{in an era}} of {{sustained}} growth. Brady became known as a specialist in identification materials, improving its existing products and developing new ones. In addition to new products, the company developed proprietary machines that could laminate, die cut, print and <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>length</b> in a single operation, boosting production volumes and reducing costs.|$|E
50|$|The {{blasting}} {{product is}} malleable {{to the extent}} that it can be <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>length,</b> laid out, or bundled for a wide variety of applications. Because the material requires heat and fast compression to detonate, it is safe to transport and manipulate once in the field, even if dropped from high altitudes, set on fire, or peppered with high velocity rifle bullets.|$|E
50|$|Quill systems predate {{threadless}} systems. With {{the advent}} of threadless stems, manufacturers {{no longer need to}} provide a range of threaded forks for a given model; all threadless system forks are made with the same length steerer tube (long). The steerer tubes are then <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>length</b> to fit upon installation. Unthreaded forks often require less labor to swap than threaded forks.|$|E
50|$|A lack of raw {{material}} forced the rayon industry to take new steps. Staple fiber as replacement for cotton {{was the new}} product, waste threads of man-made continuously spinnable filaments <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> staple <b>length.</b> In 1916, the first staple filament spinning machine was put into operation. It was developed by Emil Bronnert, a chemist and Eduard Boos, an engineer.|$|R
50|$|Cut shot is {{manufactured}} {{from high}} quality wire {{in which each}} particle is <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> a <b>length</b> about equal <b>to</b> its diameter. If required, the particles are conditioned (rounded) to remove the sharp corners produced during the cutting process. Depending on application, various hardness ranges are available, with the higher the hardness of the media the lower its durability.|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{attenuation}} {{is defined}} as proportional to the logarithm of the ratio between [...] and , where [...] is the power at point [...] and [...] respectively. Using the cutback technique, the power transmitted through a fiber of known length is measured and {{compared with the same}} measurement for the same fiber <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> a <b>length</b> of [...] approximately.|$|R
50|$|These are {{the most}} common type of {{stairlifts}} used in private dwellings with straight stairs and have a straight rail (track) which is attached to the steps of the staircase. Straight-rail stairlifts can usually be installed within days of being ordered and, having a rail which is simply <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>length</b> from a stock part, they are the least expensive stairlifts.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} {{is decorated with}} mirrors and green wood panels, with green velvet seats and marble tables. The hot chocolate is served in Spanish style - thick, dark and strong - and the churros - deep fried batter, similar to a light, crispy, linear doughnut, <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>length</b> by the staff - are served hot and freshly cooked, ready for dunking.|$|E
5000|$|There is a second-user {{market for}} {{some types of}} stairlift. This is most common with {{straight}} rail domestic types. The rails can be <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>length</b> if too long, or extended with a [...] "joining kit". Most models allow the carriage to be [...] "re-handed" [...] {{so it can be}} used on the left or right side of the staircase.|$|E
