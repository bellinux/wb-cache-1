40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a new {{criterion}} for comparing measurement results and determining <b>conformity</b> with <b>specifications</b> is proposed, which essentially {{is a strategy}} of estimating the empirical relationships of objects. Comparing with traditional methods given in GUM: 2008 and ISO 14253 - 1, this criterion improves the resolution of comparison by reducing the sizes of the coverage intervals to be compared. Interval order (a binary relation) is used for comparing the coverage intervals of the measurand and represents the empirical relations. The systematic effects of measurement are classified into two types: monotonic and non-monotonic effects, so that, without correcting the monotonic effects, a biased measurand can be specified to represent the empirical relations. Thereby the uncertainty components arising from the monotonic effects can {{be removed from the}} combined uncertainty. A strategy is given for determining the relationships among measurement results and specification limits. An example is given to demonstrate the application of the criterion...|$|R

The ARINC 653 specification not only provides a standard application programming interface for an RTOS, but also specifies how to validate an ARINC 653 based RTOS. ARINC 653 Part 3 <b>Conformity</b> Test <b>Specification</b> specifies test procedures for validation of ARINC 653 Part 1 (Required Services Specification). Existing ARINC 653 verification suites and packs do not provide platform-independency, maintainability gained by an open source framework, a reliable communication protocol, and automated testing principles at the same time. This paper introduces a brand new validation suite, GVT-A 653 which is platform-independent and ensures conformance to ARINC 653 specification. The suite is based on TETware (trademark of OpenGroup) and builds upon Continuous Integration (CI) principles. It also brings flexibility by providing various protocols including Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX) Network that provides deterministic communication required in avionics applications.

We depart from {{the hypothesis that the}} evolutionary force is intrinsic in the living system and is in reality a continuous senescence function leading gradually and unavoidably to death. We are therefore seeking a senescence function that favors social rather than solitary agents in terms of longevity without prespecifying in detail the agents' life span. We show that a senescence function relying on negative (destructive) feedback links from metabolism to program is in <b>conformity</b> with these <b>specifications.</b> We also show that senescence should affect all the regulation parameters of the agent and that the system remains nonmanipulable and unpredictable as far as its life span is concerned.

Products' <b>conformities</b> to design <b>specification</b> can be achieved through direct measurement. However, not all measurements can be done directly while the process is running. Inconformities to product's design specification could result in unfunctional or rejected products. This will render producers into losing their profits. Technology {{plays a major role in}} simplifying products' measurement processes. Advancement in technology made it possible to automate measurement processes and will also make it possible to do during the {{production process}} in achieving expected quality control as early as possible. The quality control yield measurements in products'lengths, widths and depths/ heights which will control products' dimension and generate quality control chart.

40|$|Specification) is briefly introduced. To make test {{generation}} practicable, specifications are annotated with event constraints using PCL (Parameter Constraint Language) as a {{means of}} stating test purposes. Automated test generation can then use the principle of input-output conformance to check whether an implementation agrees with its specification. Test suites are generated by a transition tour that either visits every transition at least once (for infinite behaviour) or follows every path (for finite behaviour). The approach is applied to a case study in which tests are generated for radiotherapy accelerators used in cancer treatment. A typical specification and set of test purposes yields 256 test cases that can be executed manually or automatically. The goal is to determine situations in which an accelerator does not behave in <b>conformity</b> with its <b>specification.</b> Key words Accelerator – LOTOS (Language Of Temporal Ordering Specification) – Radiotherapy – Test Generatio...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} to formalize {{different}} kinds of tests for a railway system. The common theme of the test scenarios {{is the goal of}} performing them in a reference laboratory. One line of tests concern the ETCS system, starting with <b>specification</b> <b>conformity</b> of the on-board unit. These tests are extended to address interoperability of different components of the ETCS system, and then to the validation of operational serviceability. The other line of tests aims to establish the interoperability of track-side equipment. The formalization concept for the ETCS tests starts with the conformity tests of the on-board unit, which itself is fully specified. Interoperability and serviceability address the unit's interaction with other equipment. This involves coping with systems in the test which are only partially defined. This is a feature of even more importance in the treatment of track-side interoperability. Overall, it is shown how a variety of different techniques is needed to cope with the challenge of fully attaining meaningful test results...|$|R

It is recycled {{in the form}} of (U,Pu) O- 2 fuel pellets (MOX), fabricated to a large extent according to UO 2 technology and pellet design. The similarity of physical, chemical, and neutron properties of both fuels also allows MOX fuel to be burnt in nuclear plants originally designed to burn UO 2,The industrial processes presently in use or planned are all based on a mechanical blending of UO 2 and PuO 2 powders. To obtain finely dispersed plutonium and to prevent high local concentration of plutonium, the feed materials are micronised. In the BNFL process, the whole (UO 2 PuO 2) blend is micronised by attrition milling. According to the MIMAS process, developed by BELGONUCLEAIRE, a primary blend made of UO 2 containing about 30 % PuO 2 is micronised in a ball mill, afterwards this primary blend is mechanically diluted in UO 2 to obtain the specified Pu content. After mixing, the (U,Pu) 02 powder is pressed and the pellets are sintered. The sintering cover gas contains moisture and 5 v/o H- 2.

40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) is a nuclear {{medical imaging technique}} which allows non-invasive quantitative evaluation of biochemical and functional processes by measuring the spatial distribution of radioactive tracers inside the patient body. PET is used both in clinical and pre-clinical studies, for example on small animals to test new drugs and radiotracers. Quantitative imaging {{is one of the}} key features of PET imaging and deals with the determination of the precise amount of radiotracer in each region of the body, other than its local- ization. The major limits in quantitative PET are the partial volume effect (PVE), which causes an activity spill-over from the original radioactive object to the surrounding voxels, and the presence of noise in the reconstructed image. This problem can be dealt with through a proper regularization of the reconstruction process. Image reconstruction consists in elaborating the acquired data in or- der to obtain the original spatial distribution of the radioactive source and the most common iterative algorithm for PET image reconstruction is the ML-EM (Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization). This thesis focuses on the development and the validation of a regulated reconstruction algorithm for PET images. Total variation (TV) was chosen as regularizing function, due to its behavior of smoothing uniform regions while preserving strong edges. The code was written using the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) and integrated in the existing ML-EM algo- rithm developed by the Functional Imaging and Instrumentation Group (FIIG) of the Department of Physics of the University of Pisa. In order to study the proposed regularization, a custom phantom has been designed in <b>conformity</b> with the <b>specifications</b> of the most popular protocols. The phantom was filled with a radioactive source and simulated in the GATE environment along with the geometry and the acquisition system of the Inviscan IRIS PET/CT scanner. Results showed that the denoising of the reconstructed data with the pro- posed algorithm can improve the precision on image quantification, albeit the choice of the parameter governing the regularization may depends on image features...|$|R
40|$|In practice, {{concrete}} {{is initially}} tested for compressive strength by casting a cube/cylinder, which {{is left to}} cure in favourable conditions until the date of testing. The results obtained from such tests can give a consultant guidance on the material's properties such as estimated porosity, density and compressive strength. These tests are known as control and conformity tests. Supplementary tests may be needed if the control test fails or further investigation {{must be done to}} the concrete. These tests are done by drilling core specimens out of the in-situ concrete and applying the necessary tests. These results are used to verify <b>conformity</b> with <b>specifications</b> set out by the engineer. The outcome of such a test is extremely important as it is often used as the basis to decide the integrity of the structure. Although important, in-situ compressive strength remains as one of the least understood concrete properties due to the difficulty in relating and interpreting the results. Furthermore, there is no reliable universal relationship between compressive strength of cores and; moulded cubes and cylinders. A comprehensive literature and experimental study was attempted to relate standard cube and core compressive strength, as well as, cylinder and core strengths to identify the factors that may affect the analysis and interpretation of results. An experimental program was set out to relate the compressive strength of cubes, cores and cylinders, with a length/diameter ratio of 1. 0. All specimens were cast, cured, prepared and tested in the University of Cape Town, New Engineering Building (NEB) laboratory according to South African National Standards. Twelve concrete mixes were designed using two concrete strengths (30 and 50 MPa), three maximum aggregate sizes (9. 2, 19. 2 and 26. 5 mm) and two aggregate types, namely greywacke and quartzitic sandstone. An additional two mixes of high strength concrete were created (60 and 75 MPa) using 19. 2 mm greywacke aggregate. The compressive tests involved a 100 mm cube, three diameter cylinders (70, 100 and 150 mm) and four core diameter sizes (50, 70, 100 and 150 mm). All core specimens were drilled from beams that were cast. A total of 520 specimens were tested during this study. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to all the results to identify if the compressive strengths were statistically significantly different. The compressive strength and statistical results indicate that 100 mm cubes and 100 mm diameter cores have statistically similar compressive strengths. The diameter of the core and cylinder influenced the compressive strength. It was found, as the diameter size decreased the strength increased for core specimens and the opposite was found for the cylinder. Both findings were inconsistent with literature. However, as the core and cylinder diameters increased to a size larger than 100 mm, the compressive strengths were statistically similar. With respect to the maximum aggregate size, the strength was influenced in correspondence with the diameter size. As the core diameter decreased and the maximum aggregate size increased, the compressive strength increased. Whereas, the opposite was found with the cylinders. The strength level further determined the influence that the coarse aggregate type had on the compressive strength. At the 30 MPa strength level, the aggregate types produced statistically similar strength. At the 50 MPa strength level, the sandstone produced a statistically higher compressive strength compared to the greywacke aggregate. Finally, as the strength level increased over 50 MPa {{there was no significant difference}} between the mean compressive strength of cubes and cores. It was concluded, owing to the controlled environment that the all specimens were cast, cured, prepared and tested; as well as the similarity in the geometric size, statistically comparable compressive strengths were obtained for cubes and cores...|$|R
