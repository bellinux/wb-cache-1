The final motion of a <b>compound</b> <b>attack</b> (which delivers the hit) is called a trompment.

40|$|Chronic {{hepatitis}} B affects approximately 400 {{million people}} in the world with a substantial disease burden like liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Treatment for chronic hepatitis B has improved dramatically in the last decade, resulting in more patients achieving a state of inactive disease. Currently two treatment strategies are available; treatment with peginterferon (peg-IFN) or nucleos(t) ide analogues with the aim to suppress hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA to subsequently avoid the development of cirrhosis and HCC. Unfortunately, treatment with peg-IFN can be suboptimal with important adverse effects and nucleos(t) ide analogues provoke resistance. At present, no new promising <b>compounds</b> <b>attacking</b> the HBV life cycle are in development. However, for prediction of sustained response or treatment failure, data from the long-term large peg-IFN trials provide important response markers. For the future the focus is to achieve HBsAg loss and anti-HBs conversion which is the closest the treatment can get to a cure. This review summarizes the current treatment options with their response rates and discusses future strategies for chronic hepatitis B treatmen...|$|R
