25|$|OpenPort is a {{broadband}} satellite {{voice and}} data communications system for maritime vessels. The system {{is used for}} crew calling and e-mail services on sea vessels such as merchant fleets, government and navy vessels, fishing fleets and personal yachts. Iridium’s Global Service Program provides shipboard technical support to Iridium OpenPort customers. OpenPort voice services are billed by the minute as with handheld phones, while data services are billed by the megabyte of data transferred (not by the <b>connection</b> <b>time</b> of the session).|$|E

A subsequent extension to Osaka is planned to be completed by 2045. The planned travel time from Shinagawa to Shin-Osaka is 1 hour 7 minutes. Currently the Tokaido Shinkansen has a minimum <b>connection</b> <b>time</b> of 2 hours 19 minutes.|$|E

40|$|Internet Service Providers {{sometimes}} go {{to great}} lengths to minimize dial-up <b>connection</b> <b>times,</b> in order to make the best use of limited resources. Typically they disconnect users after a fixed period of complete inactivity, such as 10 [...] 15 minutes. We propose adaptive time-out policies that take past history into account, and we evaluate some of these policies using a trace from a production environment. We find that adaptive policies can reduce cumulative <b>connection</b> <b>times</b> and average simultaneous usage by about 10 - 20 % compared to a conservative fixed threshold, in exchange for a moderate increase in the number of disconnections that inconvenience the user...|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} methods (in total seven) {{comprising}} different combinations of internal and Cartesian coordinates are tested for interpolation and alignment in connection attempts for polypeptide rearrangements. We consider Cartesian coordinates, the internal coordinates used in CHARMM, and natural internal coordinates, {{each of which has}} been interfaced to the OPTIM code and compared with the corresponding results for united-atom force fields. We show that aligning the methylene hydrogens to preserve the sign of a local dihedral angle, rather than minimizing a distance metric, provides significant improvements with respect to <b>connection</b> <b>times</b> and failures. We also demonstrate the superiority of natural coordinate methods in conjunction with internal alignment. Checking the potential energy of the interpolated structures can act as a criterion for the choice of the interpolation coordinate system, which reduces failures and <b>connection</b> <b>times</b> significantly...|$|R
50|$|Services on the Swiss railway are {{integrated}} {{with each other}} and with other forms of public transport. Unlike its European neighbours, Switzerland has not developed a comprehensive high-speed rail network, with the running speed on its one stretch, called the Rothrist-Mattstetten line, of relatively high-speed line being 200 km/h. Instead the priority is not so much the speeding up of trains between cities, but the reduction of <b>connection</b> <b>times</b> through the nodal system. Journey times on main lines between hubs are multiples of 15 minutes so that on the hour or half-hour all trains stand in the main stations at the same <b>time,</b> thus minimising <b>connection</b> <b>times.</b> Indeed, the above-mentioned Rothrist-Mattstetten line reduces journey times from Bern to Zurich from 72 minutes to 57 minutes, in keeping with the clock face scheduling.|$|R

50|$|From the caller's {{point of}} view, {{it does not}} matter where the mobile {{subscriber}} is, as the technical process of connecting the call is the same. If a subscriber is roaming on a different company's network, the subscriber, instead of the caller, may pay a surcharge for the <b>connection</b> <b>time.</b> International roaming calls are often quite expensive, and as a result some companies require subscribers to grant explicit permission to receive calls while roaming to certain countries.|$|E
