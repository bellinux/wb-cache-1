40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} link {{utilization}} estimation {{scheme based on}} Round-Trip Time (RTT) measurement with consideration of the <b>processing</b> <b>delay</b> jitter and practical timer granularity. In a previous work, RTT measurements are used to estimate link utilization from a probability distribution of the minimum RTTs on a link where the RTT variation {{is considered to be}} caused by only queuing delay. However, the original RTT-based scheme has problems with the two factors of <b>processing</b> <b>delay</b> jitter and actual timer granularity. The first problem is that <b>processing</b> <b>delay</b> jitter is only one cause of RTT variation. The observer cannot differentiate the impact of queuing from that of processing. The second problem is that measuring the minimum RTT is difficult if the timing accuracy is of the order of micro-seconds because an observer cannot determine whether an RTT value is minimum or not. The proposed scheme, which extends the previous scheme, identifies and eliminates the effects of <b>processing</b> <b>delay</b> jitter and estimates the probability of the minimum RTT with micro-second order timer granularity. The former is achieved with division by an appearance probability value of the <b>processing</b> <b>delays</b> at the ingress and egress nodes of a targeted link from the estimated RTTs on the target link. To realize the latter, the proposed scheme sets a suitable range from estimated RTTs on a target link. Experiments show that the proposed scheme effectively eliminates the jitter effects under low load with a 0. 2 reduction in deviation from the true value.

40|$|Abstract — Design {{trade-offs}} between estimation performance, <b>processing</b> <b>delay</b> {{and communication}} cost for a sensor scheduling problem is discussed. We consider a heterogeneous sensor network with {{two types of}} sensors: the first type has low-quality measurements, small <b>processing</b> <b>delay</b> and a light communication cost, while the second type is of high quality, but imposes a large <b>processing</b> <b>delay</b> and a high communication cost. Such a heterogeneous sensor network is common in applications, where for instance in a localization system the poor sensor can be an ultrasound sensor while the more powerful sensor can be a camera. Using a time-periodic Kalman filter, we show how one can find an optimal schedule of the sensor communication. One can significantly improve estimation quality by only using the expensive sensor rarely. We also demonstrate how simple sensor switching rules based on the Riccati equation drives the filter into a stable time-periodic Kalman filter. I...|$|R
