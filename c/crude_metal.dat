5|$|Iron metal {{has been}} used since ancient times, {{although}} copper alloys, which have lower melting temperatures, were used even earlier in human history. Pure iron is relatively soft, but is unobtainable by smelting because it is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities, in particular carbon, from the smelting process. A certain proportion of carbon (between 0.002% and 2.1%) produces steel, which may be up to 1000times harder than pure iron. <b>Crude</b> iron <b>metal</b> is produced in blast furnaces, where ore is reduced by coke to pig iron, which has a high carbon content. Further refinement with oxygen reduces the carbon content to the correct proportion to make steel.

40|$|Abstract – Samples {{of crude}} {{magnesium}} {{produced by the}} Mintek Thermal Magnesium Process were refined in two stages. The first stage consisted of co-melting of batches of the <b>crude</b> <b>metal</b> and MgCl 2 -KCl flux (cleaning), followed by stirring at 30 rpm for 30 minutes and settling of the sludge (mixture of molten salt and solid impurities) from the magnesium melt. The operating temperature was 680 – 730 °C. Most of the contained calcium and significant proportions of iron and silicon were transferred into the sludge phase, which left a metal containing, on average, 950 ppm Si, 470 ppm Fe, and 230 ppm Ca. In the second stage, small-scale refining tests were conducted on cleaned samples from the first stage, {{as well as on}} crude magnesium. FeCl 3 was used as the refining agent.

Crystallographic and DFT studies highlighted the presence of several ion-pair secondary interactions in the products, which can explain the improved effectiveness of the Pd etching by OrgI 3. For comparison purposes, the gold leaching by using R 2 DTLI 3 and the obtained Au complexes were investigated.

The investigation consisted of mineralogical and chemical characterization of the dolomite ore, calcining, chemical characterization, LOI (loss on ignition) determination, reduction tests on the calcined dolomite (dolime), using Iranian (Semnan) ferrosilicon and mineralogical, and chemical characterization of the reactants and products. Calcining of dolomite samples was carried out at approximately 1400 C in order to remove CO 2, moisture, and other easily volatilized impurities.

40|$|Thesis (MComm (Logistics)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Although global changes like {{political}} security, {{depletion of}} natural resources, energy supply {{and global warming}} are affecting all continents; Africa struggle the most to cope with these changes. This {{is due to the}} many historical impediments that Africa still has to overcome. Examples of these impediments are the negative effects caused by civil wars, poverty, poor infrastructure and a lack of skills. Providing reliable, effective and efficient infrastructure underpins all attempts to facilitate trade, grow the economy and reduce poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). SSA transportation related infrastructure is limited and generally in a poor condition. This poor state of transport infrastructure impedes SSA's development. However, {{it is not only the}} state of the infrastructure that challenges Africa - complicated customs and administrative procedures and inefficiencies when goods are handled at terminals and transferred from one transport mode to another also impede its potential for economic growth. In spite of these limitations, the SSA economy has been growing. As many as 28 countries (out of 48) in SSA recorded improvements in growth in 2006 and 2007. This growth was underpinned by improvement in macro-economic management in many countries, and a strong global demand for key African export commodities (sustaining high export prices, especially for <b>crude</b> oil, <b>metals</b> and minerals). Greater flows of capital to Africa, debt relief and increasing trade with the developing Asia have also helped increase resources and lift growth across SSA.

40|$|The Mintek Thermal Magnesium Process (MTMP) was {{successfully}} demonstrated in November 2004. The pilot plant was operated continuously for 8 days, during which about 30 tons of magnesium producing recipe was smelted in a dc (direct-current) arc furnace at {{a feed rate}} of 525 kg/h. The furnace was operated at power levels of 700 to 850 kW resulting in slag tapping temperatures of 1600 to 1700 °C. Magnesium extraction averaged 77 per cent and was as high as 85 per cent during good extraction periods. The furnace generated 70 to 85 kg/h magnesium vapour that was delivered to the condenser where the temperature was controlled at 680 to 720 °C. The novel condenser captured the magnesium in a liquid state, which was tapped periodically as required. In total, 15 magnesium-tapping operations were carried out, proving that on-line magnesium tapping can be consistently performed without any major difficulty. About 3500 kg of crude magnesium was produced with a quality that was similar to, if not better than, that of the Magnetherm’s <b>crude</b> <b>metal.</b> The condensation efficiency averaged 85 per cent, and peaked at 87 per cent, which exceeded the target of 80 per cent set for the pilot scale.

40|$|Many critics {{consider}} Richard Serra {{the leading}} sculptor of the 20 th century. He is famous {{not only for}} inventing something new in sculpture (abstract sculpture compositions existed before him, having been opened by constructivist vanguard {{of the beginning of}} the 20 th century). Material selections by Vladimir Tatlin and sculptures by Osip Tsadkin, as well as compositions by Henry Moor appeared before Serra. Serra is famous for transferring his works' accent from the works as they are, which could be installed in any place, to their environment. That is he saw in the sculpture a key to understanding the urban space. His <b>crude</b> <b>metal</b> sheets and profiles, rectangular and curvilinear, exceeding regular scale of sculpture, come closer to architecture. Richard Serra places them near architectural constructions as checkpoints of intermediate scale category of space located between so-called «street furniture» – lamp posts, stalls, fountains and benches – and buildings, especially huge modern ones. But the matter is not only in the scale. Serra's sculptures are not only abstract compositions that harmoniously add to the space with their spacious scale. They have some mystery, some implicit sense appearing before a pedestrian as an enigma. Their mystique opposes both street furniture and architecture. But first of all it opposes the historical sculpture with its enigma always overshadowed by historical or biographical topic. Krylov's sculpture in the Summer Garden or Minin and Pozharsky's monument on the Red Square do not strike us, because we know that those monuments are erected IN COMMEMORATION of prominent people, as fellow citizens' tribute to their great contribution to the national history. But the <b>crude</b> <b>metal</b> sheets welded at different angles – what are they for? Who needs them? As an art critic, Edward Goldman, said, fame came to Richard Serra in 1989, when the sculpture composition Tilted Arc erected eight years before it was demolished by request of the public, that did not understand its sense and was exasperated with the obvious absence of this sense. However, Serra sees his sculpture's sense not only in its filling a scale gap in the environment, but also in its instigating a man to think and to concern the environment and the space as a problem, linking this problem with a problem of human's being. Is there any other way to explain the public's indignation? Serra's sculpture compositions do not obstruct pedestrian flow and do not offend anyone's dignity or memory, do they? They act as Zen koans, as if mutely asking a spectator about the sense. Not knowing the answer, the citizen gets exasperated – not with his inability to answer, but with the sculptor (or city government), imposing this enigma to him. Only children are always happy to get an enigma. They like to train their mind in determining the sense, because they believe in the sense of being and consider themselves successors of this sense. A grown-up member of the state, both of a totalitarian one and of one with a market economy, loses this ability, believing neither in God nor in devil, neither in state officers nor in heroes. He only gets annoyed when reminded about a sense. This irritation can be explained in terms of a conflict between conviction in his right to freedom and real feeling of his fatality. He is not disposed to play with the world and the artist. He is willing only to take sedative pills, cheering drinks and all kinds of flattery. Seeing a hero made of bronze or cast iron, he feels free either to share his respect towards the hero, or to spit upon the false idol. In both cases the sense realized by him remains in his power. When this sense escapes, the illusion of his power disappears too, in other words the illusion of his rights in this world where he is kicked by those who have more power and rights. Reasoning from quite Utopian ideals of Democracy, Richard Serra believes that to train such play of mind is as necessary as to brush teeth or to button a shirt. A man with this ability not functioning falls out of the society, officially remaining its member though. But there is also another aspect – relation of such enigmas to architecture. Architecture differs from Richard Serra's sculptures not only in scale. The difference is also in the fact, that, being a plastic object like an abstract sculpture, architectural composition has social and functional status, and therefore it does not represent any special enigma. Looking at a grand construction we understand that it is a City Administration, or a Bank, or a Library, or a Museum, or… whatever having its own socially approved status and sense never doubted. So, one can treat it either with respect or with hatred, not losing the feeling of ability for sense orientation. But Serra's sculptures sometimes lead to this. Nevertheless, architecture {{has turned out to be}} sensitive to such things and it currently tries to propose an enigma to a citizen instead of suggesting its status. The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao or the Hundertwasser Viennese House in this regard come closer to sculpture, as if crushing differences between architecture and fine arts and making needless an artistic gesture such as Serra's. The question is to what extent this architectural aping is appropriate. Or maybe it is better to leave the sense space to the sculptor, focusing on the senses peculiar to architecture, which are claimed neither by Serra nor by his possible progeny. Evidently Serra experienced those problems himself, appealing to the authorities and searching for their support. Probably he was looking for support not only as an artist in need of a client, but also as an artist confronting social determinancy of architecture in urban environment. Thus he was indirectly returning to architecture its sense space, which architecture is currently ready to play with, forgetting about its sense limits. So it is a big question: whether his sculpture does harm to architecture with its competition with the latter or releases it from plays that are not appropriate to it in order to perform its maybe more sublime mission – not only to ask but also to answer the questions on the sense of being? However, solution of this problem is to what extent architects and their clients are ready to give such answers, to what extent these answers are sincere and realistic, and to what extent the society is ready to ask itself about the sense of its own being. But it is another topic. </p...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of the {{interaction}} of various pollutants in the environment is necessary to set water quelity standards. The water body receiving the effluents can have pollutants of varied nature r u u l t i n g in a conglomeration of toxic components. Measurements of toxic effects of pollutants on sessile marine bivalves provide a valuable indication of environmental impact since the resident time of such animals in any locality follows a specific pattern In this connection a multiple factor approach to study toxic effects is warranted. With this view in mind combined toxicity studies employing heavy <b>metals.</b> <b>crude</b> and pesticides were undertaken with mussels as target organisms. In the present document one of such investigations is reported. The joint action of silver (unvarying) + copper (varying) and copper (unvarying) 4 - silver (varying) mixtures were delineated, {{in the case of}} Perna viridis these combinations reduced less than additive reaction whereas in Perna indica the relation was more then additive, species specific dependence in toxicity. Silver was proved to be highly toxic when present alone in the teat medium The results clearly show that {{the interaction}} between two or more pollutant...|$|R
40|$|Higher {{performance}} liquid {{chromatographic determination}} of vanadium, nickel, copper and iron was conducted from Nigerian Crude oil samples obtained from Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC). The procedure {{was based on}} complexation of the analytes with bis (acetyl pivalyl methane) ethylenediamine (H 2 APM 2 en) followed by solvent extraction and HPLC separation on a reverse phase, C 18, 5 µm column. The complexes were eluted with methanol: acetonitrile: water (60 : 20 : 20) at a flow rate of 1 cm 3 /min. and uv detection at 260 nm. The results show that nickel had the highest concentration while copper had the least concentration. The concentration levels of these elements in the crude oil samples range from 210 – 1620 ppb for Ni, 975 – 1125 ppb for Fe, 225 – 1060 ppb for V, and 54 – 138 ppb for Cu. The pattern of occurrence for each element agreed with earlier studies using Niger Delta oils. The results indicate that trace metal data compliment well with the organic geochemical data and trace metals are useful in oil classification. It was obvious from this study that Nigerian <b>crude</b> have low <b>metal</b> content. However, despite the low concentrations, they could still pose an intrinsic health hazard considering their cumulative effect in the environment...|$|R
40|$|Biocatalytic {{membranes}} {{are promising}} to remove micro-pollutants in aqueous environment {{due to their}} mild and green operation condition. However, more efforts need to be devoted to improving their removal efficiency and stability. In this study, metal chelating affinity membrane chromatography (MCAMC) was used to construct a biocatalytic membrane by selectively capturing laccase from a <b>crude</b> fermentation broth. <b>Metal</b> ions {{had a significant effect}} on the activity of the immobilized laccase and copper ion was the best choice. A pH of 4. 5 was selected for laccase adsorption and its loading seemed the same under flow rates from 0. 5 to 10 mL min(- 1) thanks to the inherent convective transport of membrane chromatography. The pH value and salt concentration in the storage buffer had an obvious effect on the stability of the immobilized laccase, and the prepared biocatalytic membrane retained 87 % of initial activity after 20 days storage. When applying such membrane to micro-pollutant removal (taking bisphenol A (BPA) as an example), a high BPA removal efficiency (99. 3 %) could be obtained. The biocatalytic membranes could be operated at a high flux of 50 L m(- 2) h(- 1) without recycling the permeate into the feed, and its throughput and BPA removal rate were superior to the most results in the literature. However, BPA removal decline (from 99. 6 % to 56. 6 % after five cycles) occurred during the successive water treatment due to the membrane fouling caused by BPA polymerization products. Membrane regeneration could be achieved by simple elution-cleaning-reloading, and the laccase activity and BPA removal were fully recovered. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
