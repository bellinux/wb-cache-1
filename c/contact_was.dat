5|$|<b>Contact</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} on VHS and the (then new) DVD format in December 1997. Among the special features, the DVD contains three separate audio commentaries by director Zemeckis and producer Starkey, another by visual effects supervisors Ken Ralston and Stephen Rosenbaum, {{along with one}} by star Jodie Foster. <b>Contact</b> <b>was</b> {{released on}} Blu-ray Disc on October 6, 2009.|$|E
5|$|First <b>Contact</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} on VHS in late 1997 {{as one of}} several titles expected to boost sluggish sales at video retailers. A LaserDisc version was also released. First <b>Contact</b> <b>was</b> among the first titles announced for the DVD-alternative rental system Digital Video Express in 1998. It was launched with five other test titles in the select markets of Richmond, Virginia and San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|First <b>Contact</b> <b>was</b> the highest-grossing film on {{its opening}} weekend, making $92 {{million in the}} United States and Canada with an {{additional}} $54 million in other territories, combining a worldwide total of $146 million. Critical reception was mostly positive; critics including Roger Ebert considered it {{to be one of}} the best Star Trek films. The Borg and the special effects were lauded, while characterization was less evenly received. Scholarly analysis of the film has focused on Captain Jean-Luc Picard's parallels to Herman Melville's Ahab and the nature of the Borg. First <b>Contact</b> <b>was</b> nominated for an Academy Award for Best Makeup and won three Saturn Awards.|$|E
50|$|Force-guided {{contacts}} {{by themselves}} {{can not guarantee}} that all <b>contacts</b> <b>are</b> in the same state, however they do guarantee, subject to no gross mechanical fault, that no <b>contacts</b> <b>are</b> in opposite states. Otherwise, a relay with several normally open (NO) contacts may stick when energised, with some contacts closed and others still slightly open, due to mechanical tolerances. Similarly, a relay with several normally closed (NC) contacts may stick to the unenergised position, so that when energised, the circuit through one set of <b>contacts</b> <b>is</b> broken, with a marginal gap, while the other remains closed. By introducing both NO and NC contacts, or more commonly, changeover contacts, on the same relay, it then becomes possible to guarantee that if any NC <b>contact</b> <b>is</b> closed, all NO <b>contacts</b> <b>are</b> open, and conversely, if any NO <b>contact</b> <b>is</b> closed, all NC <b>contacts</b> <b>are</b> open. It {{is not possible to}} reliably ensure that any particular <b>contact</b> <b>is</b> closed, except by potentially intrusive and safety-degrading sensing of its circuit conditions, however in safety systems it is usually the NO state that is most important, and as explained above, this is reliably verifiable by detecting the closure of a contact of opposite sense.|$|R
30|$|The {{frictional}} <b>contact</b> types <b>are</b> defined {{between the}} surfaces of the individual adjacent wires of ropes. The coefficient of friction between wires is μ = 0.2. The pairs of <b>contact</b> <b>are</b> 329. The formulation of <b>contact</b> <b>is</b> Augmented Lagrange.|$|R
50|$|Contact {{refers to}} the {{conductive}} element in a connector that mate mechanically and electrically to transmit signals and/or power across a connector interface. Crimp style <b>contacts</b> <b>are</b> {{the most common type}} found in high-reliability cylindrical connectors. Male <b>contacts</b> <b>are</b> sometimes referred to as leads, posts or pins, while Female <b>contacts</b> <b>are</b> universally known as sockets.|$|R
5|$|A few {{deductions}} {{can also}} be made from the satellite communications. The first deduction {{that can be made}} from the satellite communications is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19—seven hours after final <b>contact</b> <b>was</b> made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying BFO values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, so it {{can also be}} deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E

5|$|Although a {{powerful}} cyclone over water, {{the storm had}} relatively little impact over land. In the Valsad district, two coastal communities lost a combined 200 homes due to large swells produced by the storm. However, the losses were more extensive offshore. Between 120 and 900 fishermen were listed as missing after <b>contact</b> <b>was</b> lost with their vessels during the storm.|$|E

50|$|Battery <b>contacts</b> <b>are</b> {{the most}} {{important}} part of the design and require serious consideration. Since batteries are nickel-plated, it <b>is</b> recommended the <b>contacts</b> <b>be</b> nickel-plated to prevent galvanic corrosion between dissimilar metals. Battery <b>contacts</b> may <b>be</b> fixed <b>contacts,</b> flexible contacts, or some combination of the two.|$|R
25|$|Through 20 December 2016, 605 Category 3, 39 Category 2, and two Category 1 <b>contacts</b> <b>were</b> {{identified}}. The two Category 1 <b>contacts</b> <b>were</b> {{identified as}} a shipwreck and a rock field.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{relatively}} intense language contact, Central Atlas Tamazight has a large stratum of Arabic loans. Many borrowed words in Berber also have native synonyms, e.g. /lbab/ or /tiflut/ 'door', the latter used more in rural areas. The <b>contact</b> <b>was</b> unequal, as Moroccan Arabic has not borrowed as much from Berber languages, though Berber has contributed to Moroccan and Algerian Arabics' very reduced vowel systems.|$|E
5|$|Busch did {{not remain}} in Frankfurt. Towards {{the end of}} the 1860s he alternated between Wiedensahl and Lüthorst, and Wolfenbüttel where his brother Gustav lived. The {{association}} with Johanna Kessler lasted five years, and after his return to Wiedensahl in 1872 they communicated by letter. This <b>contact</b> <b>was</b> interrupted between 1877 and 1891, after which it was revived with the help of Kessler's daughters.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{through an}} {{advertisement}} {{in the national}} press, <b>contact</b> <b>was</b> made between former paratroopers in Wiesbaden and four English ex-servicemen in Royal Tunbridge Wells. Through this contact the friendship that now exists between the two towns sprang up, leading to the signing in 1989 of the official Twinning Charter. Also through this the Tunbridge Wells Twinning and Friendship Association (TWTFA) was formed.|$|E
50|$|Because {{brush-type}} <b>contacts</b> <b>are</b> {{susceptible to}} wear, encoders using <b>contacts</b> <b>are</b> not common; {{they can be}} found in low-speed applications such as manual volume or tuning controls in a radio receiver.|$|R

40|$|In {{a patient}} with {{superior}} oblique myokymia, a <b>contact</b> <b>is</b> visualised between the right trochlear nerve and a vascular structure by high resolution thin slices magnetic resonance images coupled to angio-MR. A similar <b>contact</b> <b>is</b> not visualised on the left side. This suggests that the neuro-vascular <b>contact</b> <b>is</b> {{the cause of this}} superior oblique myokymia and offers the possibility of neuro-surgical decompression if necessary.

5|$|Malaysia Airlines {{issued a}} media {{statement}} at 07:24 MYT, one {{hour after the}} scheduled arrival time of the flight at Beijing, stating that contact with the flight had been lost by Malaysian ATC at 02:40 {{and that the government}} had initiated search-and-rescue operations; the time when <b>contact</b> <b>was</b> lost was later corrected to 01:21. Neither the crew nor the aircraft's communication systems relayed a distress signal, indications of bad weather, or technical problems before the aircraft vanished from radar screens.|$|E
5|$|On 17 October 1943, Haruna again left Truk {{as part of}} an {{even larger}} force—five battleships, three fleet carriers, eight heavy cruisers, three light cruisers and {{numerous}} destroyers—in response to American raids on Wake Island. When no <b>contact</b> <b>was</b> made the force returned to Truk on 26 October 1943. On 16 December 1943, she arrived at Sasebo for refits and inland-sea training.|$|E
5|$|The Embraer, on {{the other}} hand, started calling Brasilia Center, also unsuccessfully, from 16:48 and {{continued}} with twelve more unsuccessful attempts until 16:53. Some limited <b>contact</b> <b>was</b> made at that point, but the Embraer was unable to copy the Amazonic Center frequencies. The Embraer then continued its attempts to reach Brasilia Center, seven more times until the collision.|$|E
50|$|On {{the female}} plug, the outer body is {{metallic}} and cylindrical in shape, and comprises {{one of the}} two contacts. The second, inside <b>contact</b> <b>is</b> a hollow metallic cylinder constructed to accept insertion of the pin in the corresponding male connector. The inner and outer barrels are separated by an insulating layer. The outer <b>contact</b> <b>is</b> generally called the barrel, sleeve or ring, and the inner <b>contact</b> <b>is</b> called the tip.|$|R
25|$|However, for exact {{analytical}} results, it {{is required}} that the <b>contact</b> problem <b>is</b> axisymmetric and the <b>contacts</b> <b>are</b> compact.|$|R
50|$|Ultimate is non-contact, meaning non-incidental {{physical}} <b>contact</b> <b>is</b> disallowed. Defenders cannot {{take the}} disc from an offensive {{player who has}} secured a catch.

5|$|When Paramount {{announced}} its first slate of DVD releases in August 1998, First <b>Contact</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the}} first ten titles released in October, announced in a conscious effort to showcase effects-driven films. This version contained the feature and two trailers, but no other special features. The film was presented in a 2.35:1 anamorphic aspect ratio, with a surround sound Dolby Digital 5.1 audio mix.|$|E
5|$|ASquadron 4RTR and the 1st Durham Light Infantry (1DLI) {{continued}} the advance toward Fort Capuzzo. Concealed in hull down positions behind a ridge near the fort were 20–30 German tanks, supported by anti tank guns. These engaged ASquadron, disabling five tanks, but {{were forced to}} withdraw as the squadron pressed its attack. On the final approach to Fort Capuzzo, <b>contact</b> <b>was</b> lost between 4RTR's tanks and 1DLI's leading CCompany, and {{the attack on the}} fort began without armoured support. The fort was vigorously defended, and it was not until just before midday that CCompany, reunited with ASquadron 4RTR and reinforced by A and BCompanies 1DLI, eventually took the position. DCompany 1DLI—which had been in reserve during the attack—then made a wide left hook to capture a small landing ground {{to the north of the}} fort.|$|E
5|$|ATC {{maintained}} normal {{two-way radio}} {{contact with the}} Embraer up until 15:51, when the last successful radio exchange with the Embraer was made on VHF frequency 125.05MHz with Brasilia Center. At that point the Embraer was just approaching the Brasilia VOR. The Embraer overflew the Brasilia VOR at 15:55, four minutes later, and proceeded northwest-bound along UZ6. At 16:02, seven minutes after crossing the Brasilia VOR, secondary radar <b>contact</b> <b>was</b> lost with the Embraer, thus stopping the display of the Embraer's reported altitude (Mode C) on the controller's radar screen.|$|E

5|$|After {{consolidating}} {{his position}} in 1240, Haakon focused on displaying the supremacy of the kingship, influenced by the increasingly closer contact with European culture. He started constructing several monumental royal buildings, primarily in the royal estate in Bergen where he built a European-style stone palace. He used a grand fleet with stately royal ships when meeting with other Scandinavian rulers, and actively sent letters and gifts to other European rulers; his most far-reaching <b>contact</b> <b>was</b> achieved when he sent gyrfalcons with an embassy to the Sultan of Tunis.|$|E
5|$|At 03:35, the 6th Airborne Division {{headquarters}} landed by glider in the landing-zone {{cleared by}} sappers. Only a few gliders missed the landing-zone, {{due to the}} poor weather and errors in navigation. Once the headquarters staff and accompanying airborne troops had been gathered together, the headquarters {{was moved to the}} Le Bas de Ranville area and set up there. <b>Contact</b> <b>was</b> established with the headquarters of 5th Parachute Brigade at 05:00, and with the headquarters of 3rd Parachute Brigade at 12:35, and the division linked up with 1st Special Service Brigade as it advanced from the invasion beaches at 13:53.|$|E
5|$|At Kalai the {{battalion}} {{moved into the}} Kamandran Mission where they received intelligence reports of a force of about 200 Japanese occupying a position at Gogbulo creek. Fighting patrols were sent out, but no <b>contact</b> <b>was</b> made, although evidence of occupation was found indicating that the Japanese were moving back to a defensive position {{to the north of}} Mavelo river. Before they could launch an assault, however, {{the battalion}} was relieved by the 19th Battalion and on 28 February the 19th crossed the Mavelo. Following this the Japanese withdrew back towards the mountains around the Waitavalo and Tol Plantations, and in early March an attempt was made to force a crossing on the Wulwut river. After initially being turned back by intense Japanese mortar and machine-gun fire, the 19th made a successful second attempt, forcing the Japanese back further towards Mount Sugi and Bacon Hill.|$|E

5000|$|In electronics, {{switches}} {{are classified}} {{according to the}} arrangement of their contacts. A pair of <b>contacts</b> <b>is</b> said to be [...] "closed" [...] when current can flow {{from one to the}} other. When the <b>contacts</b> <b>are</b> separated by an insulating air gap, they are said to be [...] "open", and no current can flow between them at normal voltages. The terms [...] "make" [...] for closure of contacts and [...] "break" [...] for opening of <b>contacts</b> <b>are</b> also widely used.|$|R
2500|$|Analytical {{solution}} {{methods for}} non-adhesive <b>contact</b> problem can <b>be</b> classified into two types {{based on the}} geometry of the area of contact. [...] A conforming <b>contact</b> <b>is</b> {{one in which the}} two bodies touch at multiple points before any deformation takes place (i.e., they just [...] "fit together"). [...] A non-conforming <b>contact</b> <b>is</b> one in which the shapes of the bodies are dissimilar enough that, under zero load, they only touch at a point (or possibly along a line). In the non-conforming case, the <b>contact</b> area <b>is</b> small compared to the sizes of the objects and the stresses are highly concentrated in this area. Such a <b>contact</b> <b>is</b> called concentrated, otherwise it is called diversified.|$|R
