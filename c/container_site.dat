The nature {{of this study is}} a three-way material exchange between theoretical discourses, my practice, and audience response. The theoretical discourse includes a survey of the notions of time from different fields of knowledge from science, literature, anthropology, and memory studies. Additionally, an analysis of two contemporary installations, Normal & Nature by a Thai artist, Kamin Lertchaiprasert, and Going Forth by Day by an American artist, Bill Viola, is included. Project 1, A solo show by Toeingam Srisubut, featured three art pieces: time-scape, <b>container</b> <b>site,</b> and [...] . and a real TV. The first project explored the potential media that can give shape to time and make the characteristics of time explicit. My evaluation of this project focuses on analysing the characteristics of time that grow out of my three works, and examining the audience's multiple readings of time that reveal various indicators, e. g. spaces, narratives, audience's and my memories, and certain Thai social and economic elements. In Project 2, a sound and performance installation Rush Hour, narrative, space, and audience participation are considered specifically. I am testing out how effective the three indicators can give shape to time, and identifying the different characteristics of time of the installation placed in a specific environment of Koh Samui. Project 3, a mix-media installation, When I grow rich, say the bells of Shoreditch, re-tested the three indicators. This project demonstrates my personal, cultural engagements and interpretations of these indicators. The research identifies further areas for potential studies within various aspects of time as well as practical ways of giving shape to it.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Dengue is {{a serious}} public health problem worldwide, with cases {{reported}} annually in tropical and subtropical regions. Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762), the main vector of dengue, is a domiciliary species with high dispersal and survival capacities and can use various artificial <b>containers</b> as breeding <b>sites.</b> We assessed potential <b>container</b> breeding <b>sites</b> of A. aegypti in the municipality of Caxias, Maranhão, Brazil. METHODS: In the initial phase, we analyzed 900 properties in 3 neighborhoods during the dry and rainy seasons (August-October 2005 and February-April 2006, respectively). During the second sampling period, September 2006 -August 2007, we used 5 assessment cycles for 300 properties in a single neighborhood. RESULTS: During the dry and rainy seasons, water-storage containers comprised 55. 7 % (n = 1, 970) and 48. 5 % (n = 1, 836) of the total containers inspected, and showed the highest productivity of immature A. aegypti; we found 23. 7 and 106. 1 individuals/container, respectively, in peridomicile sites. In intradomicile <b>sites,</b> water-storage <b>containers</b> were also the most important breeding sites with 86. 4 % (n = 973) and 85. 6 % (n = 900) of all containers and a mean of 7. 9 and 108. 3 individuals/container in the dry and rainy seaso-October 2006 (1, 342). The highest number of positives (70) was recorded in May, mostly (94 %) in storage containers.

This study identified the container categories most productive for A. aegypti {{within the framework of}} the São Paulo dengue vector control program (DVCP) in São Sebastião, a large city located on the state’s coast where dengue cases have occurred since 2001. Containers were inspected monthly for the occurrence of mosquito immature stages during two consecutive vector-breeding seasons in 2002 – 2004. Containers were classified by their material, use, and fixed or removable status. Pupal productivity differed significantly among container types, items made of metal and plastic, and boats being those with the highest relative contribution. Significant correlations between traditional indices of A. aegypti abundance (Container Index, House Index, and Breteau Index) and pupal productivity/demographic indices (Pupae/Container, Pupae/House, Pupae/ha, and Pupae/Person) ranged 0. 56 – 0. 65; correlations were not statistically significant for any combination involving the Pupae/Container index. The assessment of pupal productivity indices could be incorporated into the DVCP without any additional operational onus, allowing vector control managers to determine appropriate control actions targeting the most productive <b>containers</b> and <b>sites.</b> Further studies are needed to assess whether pupal productivity indices may be used as epidemiological indicators of risk of dengue transmission...|$|R

40|$|The {{mosquito}} {{virus vector}} Aedes (Ae.) aegypti exploits {{a wide range}} of <b>containers</b> as <b>sites</b> for egg laying and development of the immature life stages, yet the approaches for modeling meteorologically sensitive container water dynamics have been limited. This study introduces the Water Height and Temperature in Container Habitats Energy Model (WHATCH'EM), a state-of-the-science, physically based energy balance model of water height and temperature in containers that may serve as development sites for mosquitoes. The authors employ WHATCH'EM to model container water dynamics in three cities along a climatic gradient in M 9 xico ranging from sea level, where Ae. aegypti is highly abundant, to 2100 m, where Ae. aegypti is rarely found. When compared with measurements from a 1 -month field experiment in two of these cities during summer 2013, WHATCH'EM realistically simulates the daily mean and range of water temperature for a variety of containers. To examine container dynamics for an entire season, WHATCH'EM is also driven with field-derived meteorological data from May to September 2011 and evaluated for three commonly encountered container types. WHATCH'EM simulates the highly nonlinear manner in which air temperature, humidity, rainfall, clouds, and container characteristics (shape, size, and color) determine water temperature and height. Sunlight exposure, modulated by clouds and shading from nearby objects, plays a first-order role. In general, simulated water temperatures are higher for containers that are larger, darker, and receive more sunlight. WHATCH'EM simulations will be helpful in understanding the limiting meteorological and container-related factors for proliferation of Ae. aegypti and may be useful for informing weather-driven early warning systems for viruses transmitted by Ae. aegypti.

Significant reductions in both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, OI were observed both indoors and outdoors, in treated sites compared to untreated sites (p< 0. 05). 01 reduction was achieved over time in the treated area. The CH was suppressed to below 10. This was maintained for 4 weeks into the post-treatment phase. The outdoor CH at the untreated site remained at more than 40 for 38 weeks during the evaluation period. One dengue case occurred at the Bti treatment site {{at the beginning of the}} treatment phase, but no further cases were detected during the remainder of the treatment phase. However, there was an ongoing dengue outbreak in the untreated area with 15 serologically confirmed cases during weeks 37 - 54. Intensive fogging operations with pyrethroids at the untreated (Bti) site had a positive impact on Ae. albopictus, but not on Ae. aegypti...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Every {{material}} {{arriving at}} the construction site comes protected in some type of packaging, fundamentally cardboard, plastic or wood, and presently {{the great majority of}} these packagings finish in a container mixed with the rest of waste of the construction work. The increasing tendency to use prefabricated materials increases the volume of packaging necessary in product transport; in addition, the traditional materials also arrive more protected with packaging. A specific management for this kind of waste is analyzed on this article. The main problem packaging implies in a construction work is the volume it occupies; {{in the case of the}} plastic, the construction of a block of 100 houses generates more than 1, 700 m 3 of plastic waste, basically film to wrap the pallets, and a weight of 35 kg. This means that if traditional containers are used, these will transport a great amount of air. Recommendations for the management of the waste coming from plastics packaging includes the segregation at origin, trying to maintain the product packed until the last moment and immediately storing the packaging material once it has been opened. When there is space enough at the work <b>site,</b> <b>containers</b> of greater dimensions than the traditional ones can be used. These containers will be only for discarded plastic materials, and at the same time, compactors can be used to reduce the volume of plastics. Finally, once the container is filled up with the specific waste, it will be managed by an authorized valorizing agent, indicating the waste nature...|$|R
