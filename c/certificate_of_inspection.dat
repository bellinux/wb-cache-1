Box 1625 M/S 6122, Idaho Falls, ID 83415 - 6122 2 Quality Engineer, RPS Program, Idaho National Laboratory 3 Quality Engineer, RPS Program, Idaho National Laboratory Contact: Voice: (208) 533 - 7550 Email: Drake. Kirkham@inl. gov Abstract. The Radioisotope Power Systems Program of the Idaho National Laboratory {{makes an}} {{empirical}} {{case for a}} highly integrated Quality Assurance function pertaining to the preparation, assembly, testing, storage and transportation of 238 Pu fueled radioisotope thermoelectric generators. Case data represents multiple campaigns including the Pluto/New Horizons mission, the Mars Science Laboratory mission in progress, and other related projects. Traditional Quality Assurance models would attempt to reduce cost by minimizing the role of dedicated Quality Assurance personnel in favor of either functional tasking or peer-based implementations. Highly integrated Quality Assurance adds value by placing trained quality inspectors on the production floor side-by-side with nuclear facility operators to enhance team dynamics, reduce inspection wait time, and provide for immediate, independent feedback. Value is also added by maintaining dedicated Quality Engineers to provide for rapid identification and resolution of corrective action, enhanced and expedited supply chain interfaces, improved bonded storage capabilities, and technical resources for requirements management including data package development and <b>Certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inspection.</b> A broad examination of cost-benefit indicates highly integrated Quality Assurance can reduce cost through the mitigation of risk and reducing administrative burden thereby allowing engineers to be engineers, nuclear operators to be nuclear operators, and the cross-functional team to operate more efficiently. Applicability of this case extends to any high-value, long-term project where traceability and accountability are determining factors...|$|R
50|$|The {{changing}} fire {{life safety}} requirements for high rise flats caused Edgewater Towers {{to be treated}} as a test case for fire life safety and Edgewater Towers was required to install an improved fire life safety system by the Port Phillip Council in the late 1980s. The Port Phillip Council required Edgewater Towers to have a further fire life safety upgrade in 2002 and was subsequently fitted with a fire sprinkler protection system and fully addressable automatic fire detection and alarm system between 2005 and 2008, and certified complete 2014. The earlier fire life safety upgrade between 1989 and 1995 included fire hose reels, a smoke and heat detection system, enclosure of the previously open West stairwell, sealing of floor penetrations, closure of the mail chute, emergency and exit lighting, removal of glazed timber doors in the corridors, modifications to both stairs to discharge directly to outdoors, fire rated doors, fire rated enclosed balcony ends and blocking up corridor clerestory glazing to each flat to achieve the necessary 1-hour fire-resistance rating. The sprinkler fire protection system was activated in August 2013, when a fire started on a balcony on the 11th. floor. The Age newspaper carried the story. Edgewater Towers has an Essential Safety Measures, <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> Final <b>Inspection</b> dated 14 July 2014 displayed in the lobby.|$|R

There, her course yard was removed and was rigged as a square topsail schooner. When the teak deck needed replacement due to leakage, the owners decided to temporarily move the ship to San Diego because of its ideal weather conditions. After a few transits back and forth between San Diego and Gig Harbor, the ship was permanently relocated to San Diego where she resides now.|$|E

40|$|Objective—To {{evaluate}} {{the differences among}} each state’s Interstate <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> Veterinary <b>Inspection</b> (ICVI) form and the legibility of data on paper ICVIs used to support disease tracing in cattle. Design—Descriptive retrospective cross-sectional study. Sample—Examples of ICVIs from 50 states and 7, 630 randomly sampled completed paper ICVIs for cattle from 48 states. Procedures—Differences among paper ICVI forms from all 50 states were determined. Sixteen data elements were selected for further evaluation of their value in tracing cattle. Completed paper ICVIs for interstate cattle exports in 2009 were collected from 48 states. Each of the 16 data elements was recorded as legible, absent, or illegible on forms completed by accredited veterinarians, and results were summarized by state. Mean values for legibility {{at the state level}} were used to estimate legibility of data at the national level. Results—ICVIs were inconsistent among states in regard to data elements requested and availability of legible records. A mean ± SD of 70. 0 ± 22. 1 % of ICVIs in each state had legible origin address information. Legible destination address information was less common, with 55. 0 ± 21. 4 % of records complete. Incomplete address information was most often a result of the field having been left blank. Official animal identification was present on 33. 1 % of ICVIs. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—The inconsistency among state ICVI forms and quality of information provided on paper ICVIs could lead to delays and the need for additional resources to trace cattle, which could result in continued spread of disease. Standardized ICVIs among states and more thorough recording of information by accredited veterinarians or expanded usage of electronic ICVIs could enhance traceability of cattle during an outbreak...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to define legal elements of organic agricultural products quality. The quality of organic agricultural products is a specific category of agricultural products quality. According to Community regulations the quality of organic agricultural products {{is placed in the}} "quality of production" system in accordance with the standards set out by the Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092 / 91 of 24 July 1991. The quality of organic agricultural products is not of local character, but comes under globalisation and is subject to standards that serve the liberalisation of trade, contrary to ‘agricultural products as traditional specialties guaranteed’, ‘products with designation of origin’, or ‘products with geographical indications’. The quality of organic agricultural products derives from the quality of the organic method, whose compliance with the prescribed standards, and the requirements of Regulation No 2092 / 91 is subjected to inspection proceedings during all stages of production and marketing. The competent authority then confirms positive effects of such proceedings with a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> stating the compliance with those standards, which is notified to consumers by an organic label on agricultural products...|$|E

[...] After all inspections are passed, the last step is generally to have a walk-through {{by a member of the}} Department of Buildings, who sees that there is no major construction remaining on the job site, that there are no obstructions to the entrances, that there are no safety hazards in the building, and that everything in the building was built according to plan.
