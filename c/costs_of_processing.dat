25|$|On 24 November 2016, the Canadian {{government}} announced that starting from 25 November 2016, Mexican nationals {{can apply for}} the eTA online. However, Mexicans entering Canada before 1 December would continue to need a visa. On the same day, Mexican nationals could no longer apply for a visa online and had to apply on paper through a visa application centre. The visa requirement was lifted on 1 December as planned and the issuance of visas to Mexican nationals ceased, although Statistics Canada predicts that the net cost of lifting the visa requirement is over C$262 million in the next decade, which includes the additional immigration enforcement resources and the extra <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> asylum claims.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Aim of {{this paper}} is to set some cost {{benchmarks}} for the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> an insurance application and processing a claim. Design/methodology/approach – Activity-based costing (ABC) model. The ABC model was applied to a unified business process and set the benchmarks for the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> an application and a claim. Findings – The average cost per application is approximately AUD 221 and the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> a claim is AUD 260. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> support functions is higher in the case <b>of</b> application <b>processing</b> and back office direct costs are higher in the case <b>of</b> claim <b>processing.</b> Research limitations/implications – The success of benchmarking exercises depends on the cooperation of the benchmarking partners. Furthermore, the benchmarks can be more accurate when ABC is applied to the business processes. Most insurance providers are yet to adopt the ABC model. Originality/value – This paper introduces the breakdown <b>of</b> the <b>processing</b> <b>costs</b> for general insurance. The breakdown is given on the basis of direct and indirect costs as well as front office, back office and support function costs. To the best of author’s knowledge this is the first application of process benchmarking to the insurance industry...|$|R
50|$|Mortgage Application Fees, paid by {{the buyer}} to the lender, to cover the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> their loan {{application}}.

5000|$|Application fees apply. Section 5 (2)(d) Forests Practices Act 1985 [...] {{requires}} that, [...] "an {{application to}} declare land {{as a private}} timber reserve {{must be accompanied by}} a fee". Originally the cost per application was AUD$100 (prior to 1999) with a fee of AUD$350 introduced in 1999-2000. The fee increase followed an instruction from the Government that the fee should cover the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> the application.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the idea}} of a {{consumer}} level camera that could make lenticular 3D prints similar to those that had appeared for many years on book covers and other novelty items certainly had appeal, it did not receive a large market share of camera purchases, partially due to the high <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> and longer wait times than traditional cameras. In the summer of 1982, Nimslo was the fastest selling 35mm camera in the U.S., including being {{on the cover of the}} Sears, Roebuck Catalogue.|$|E

5000|$|More specifically, in (food) {{processing}} business, {{there are}} three types of variable cost: VC1 = Raw Materials and Ingredients, VC2 = <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> inputs into outputs, VC3 = costs of packaging materials. The fixed cost (FC) are also divided into three types: FC1 = depreciation of fixed assets, FC2 = interests paid, FC3 = overheads (salaries, transport, maintenance, marketing, ...). Using these 5 parameters in simple formulas, a trained person can do a Cigar Box Profit analysis in half an hour. When data are missing assumptions can be made using educated guesses.|$|E

50|$|Libraries with {{depository}} status {{are required}} to provide the documents received {{at no cost to}} their patrons. Though they receive the publications free of charge, depository libraries are responsible for the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> the items and making them available. All depository libraries must make their collections of these documents available to the general public, and the services provided for government documents must be on par with the services offered to the primary users of a library. Circulation policies for government documents, however, are established by each library itself. Libraries may house the materials however they like; for example, they may separate the government documents from the rest of their collection or they may integrate them. A library cannot filter Internet search results at public access stations as access to health or biological science articles may not be infringed upon.|$|E
5000|$|Often {{people wonder}} [...] why the NRCS {{implemented}} the CSP on a watershed basis {{instead of a}} nationwide basis. The NRCS stands behind their decision and believe a staged, watershed-based implementation of CSP made the most sense - economically, practically, and administratively. They feel that focusing on high priority watersheds will reduce the administrative burden on applicants, and will reduce the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> {{a large number of}} applications that cannot be funded. Also, the NRCS expects that a significant number of producers will seek participation in the Conservation Security Program and ask for assistance to determine their potential eligibility for the program. By law, the NRCS cannot incur technical assistance costs in excess of 15 percent of the funds expended in that fiscal year for the CSP. Given this modest service funding, the NRCS must focus and limit the land and landowners that its conservations can serve at one time. Offering the Conservation Security Program in only selected watersheds provides that focus (4,6).|$|E

30|$|The {{performance}} of a standard, stand-alone UI program would also likely be hindered by large start-up costs, as well as large <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> benefit claims. Because the design of such a program calls for specific monitoring functions, the program administration would be costly, as its ability to piggy-back on other administrative systems (social security, in particular) would be limited. Moreover, there would likely be problems with {{the enforcement of the}} payment of contributions to the UB fund, particularly in industries with low layoff probability. And if substantial reserves of the UB program are accumulated, they might be used for other purposes.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a single-machine scheduling problem with an outsourcing option {{in an environment}} where the processing time and outsourcing cost are uncertain. The performance measure is the total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> some jobs in-house and outsourcing the rest. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> in-house jobs is measured as the total weighted completion time, which can be considered the operating cost. The uncertainty is described through either an interval or a discrete scenario. The objective is to minimize the maximum deviation from the optimal <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> each scenario. Since the deterministic version is known to be NP-hard, we focus on two special cases, one in which all jobs have identical weights and the other in which all jobs have identical processing times. We analyze the computational complexity of each case and present the conditions that make them polynomially solvable...|$|R
40|$|Research {{activity}} on query evaluation and optimization has been centered around processing one query at a time.

This proposition is derived theoretically by considering the benefits and costs of different numbers of alternatives and is supported by three experimental studies. Because, in large sets, the perceptual <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> alternatives varying in shape are greater than for alternatives varying in color, we also predict and demonstrate greater satisfaction from choosing from the latter. We further show that the “satisfaction function ” is affected by gender and cultural background...|$|E
