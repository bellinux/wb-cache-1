Maintaining a common currency requires a strong political consensus {{in respect to}} monetary and fiscal targets, a <b>common</b> <b>institution</b> in charge of implementing these targets, and some minimum of common legislation (concerning the banking and foreign exchange regulations). These conditions were far from being met amidst the turbulent economic and political situation.|$|E
60|$|To pass {{now from}} the mental to the outward and {{objective}} requisites of society: {{it is impossible to}} point out any contrivance in politics, or arrangement of social affairs, which conduces to Order only, or to Progress only; whatever tends to either promotes both. Take, for instance, the <b>common</b> <b>institution</b> of a police. Order is the object which seems most immediately interested in the efficiency of this part of the social organization. Yet, if it is effectual to promote Order, that is, if it represses crime, and enables every one to feel his person and property secure, can any state of things be more conducive to Progress? The greater security of property {{is one of the main}} conditions and causes of greater production, which is Progress in its most familiar and vulgarest aspect. The better repression of crime represses the dispositions which tend to crime, and this is Progress in a somewhat higher sense. The release of the individual from the cares and anxieties of a state of imperfect protection sets his faculties free to be employed in any new effort for improving his own state and that of others, while the same cause, by attaching him to social existence, and making him no longer see present or prospective enemies in his fellow creatures, fosters all those feelings of kindness and fellowship towards others, and interest in the general well-being of the community, which are such important parts of social improvement.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, {{aquaculture}} {{has become the}} most important livelihood activity in Tam Giang Lagoon, Vietnam. The aquaculture boom has reduced the available water area for mobile gear fishers, polarized different user-groups, created resource conflicts, and increased pressures on the lagoon systems. Aquaculture in the lagoon is governed by both customary and legal rights. The objective {{of this paper is to}} explore the diversity of resource use and the complexity of property rights in one of the villages located in the lagoon. The paper emphasizes the linkages between changes in <b>commons</b> <b>institutions</b> and changes in resource use and property rights. First, the political and socio-economic changes in Vietnam are examined as well as how they have influenced traditional <b>commons</b> <b>institutions</b> and lagoon resource management in the village. Second, the linkages between <b>common</b> <b>institutions</b> and the diversity of property rights are analyzed. Particular attention is given to the analysis of different types of resource use associated with "bundle of rights" and the diversity of property rights regimes in the village. </p...|$|R

After the independence of post-Yugoslav states, the Islamic Community of Bosnia and Herzegovina has either jurisdiction over Islamic Communities in region (Croatia, Slovenia, Sandžak and Bosniak religious communities and mosques around the world) or is recognized as the highest moral authority of Muslims in the region (Montenegro, Serbia, Hungary).|$|E

40|$|Interdependence, {{collective}} {{identities and}} <b>common</b> <b>institutions</b> are the preconditions for {{the evolution of}} a pluralistic security community. While the interaction of the states of Southern Latin America already meets the first two criteria, this article focuses on the third one, particularly the <b>common</b> <b>institutions</b> of the regional defence and security sector. The bilaterally organised defence cooperation has been attested democratic deficiencies because military actors are over-proportionally represented in these committees. Military nationalism and an exaggerated notion of national sovereignty in the military academies of the region can be regarded as cooperation hampering qualifiers. Non-military threats (organised crime, transnational terrorism) have centripetal effects on the subregional cooperation, which is structured multilaterally and shows a relatively high degree of institutionalisation. security community, regional cooperation, defence and security policies, Latin America, Mercosur, Argentina, Brazil, Chile...|$|R

Only on the express wish of the Kingdom of Hungary was the designation [...] "k.u.k." [...] (kaiserlich und königlich i.e. [...] "Imperial and Royal") introduced {{in order to make}} the distinction clearer between the new Austrian army, the k.k. Landwehr, and the new Hungarian force, the k.u. Honved. The navy did not use [...] "k.u.k." [...] as often, because there were few other naval forces apart from the main navy.|$|E
5000|$|After Isabella's {{victory in}} the civil war and Ferdinand's {{ascension}} to the Aragonese throne the two crowns were united under the same monarchs. However, this was a personal union and both kingdoms remained administratively separate to some extent, each maintaining largely its own laws; both parliaments remained separate, the only <b>common</b> <b>institution</b> would be the Inquisition. Despite their titles of [...] "Monarchs of Castile, Leon, Aragon and Sicily" [...] Ferdinand and Isabella reigned over their respective territories, although they also took decisions together. Its central position, larger territorial area (three times greater than that of Aragon) and larger population (4.3 million as opposed to the 1 million in Aragon) led to Castile becoming the dominating partner in the union.|$|E

As a nationalist he refused to sacrifice France’s independence by ceding power to the <b>common</b> <b>institutions.</b> He risked the existence of a united Europe, but after his sudden departure in 1969 it became clear that French popular opinion opposed his limiting policy towards European integration...|$|R
50|$|Since {{amalgamation}} is {{more demanding}} than integration, Deutsch identified eight conditions {{that should be}} satisfied if amalgamation is to succeed: the mutual compatibility of main values, a distinctive way of life, capabilities and processes of cross-cutting communication, high geographic and social mobility, multiplicity and balance of transactions, a significant frequency of some interchange in group roles, a broadening of the political elite, and high political and administrative capabilities.

50|$|The Romans practiced dowry (dos). The dowry was {{property}} transferred by the bride, or on {{her behalf}} by anyone else, to the groom or groom's father, at their marriage. Dowry was a very <b>common</b> <b>institution</b> in Roman times, and it began out {{of a desire to}} get the bride’s family to contribute a share of the costs involved in setting up a new household. Dos was given for the purpose of enabling the husband to sustain the charges of the marriage state (onera matrimonii). All the property of the wife which was not dowry, or was not a donatio propter nuptias, continued to be her own property, and was called Parapherna. The dowry could include any form of property, given or promised at the time of marriage, but only what remained after deducting the debts. Not only the bride's family, any person could donate his property as dowry for the woman.|$|E
50|$|On {{the death}} of James I, the new king of Majorca, James II, decided not {{to pay tribute to}} Peter III of Aragon. Preoccupied with diverse {{problems}} within the realm, it was not until 1279 when the Majorcan monarch reconciled to have his states recognized as subordinate to the king of Aragon. As a consequence the Kingdom of Majorca could not hold court, and the king of Majorca was forced to go to Catalonia to present tribute to the king of Aragon. By means of the Treaty of Perpignan in 1279, an imbalance of power between the Kingdom of Aragon and the Kingdom of Majorca was created. The Aragonian king maintained the political and economic control of Aragon over the Kingdom of Majorca, reestablishing the unified jurisdiction of the Crown of Aragon, which was broken by the will of James I. This treaty would condition relations between the Kingdom of Majorca and the Crown of Aragon throughout the former's existence. The lack of courts later aggravated the destabilization of a kingdom already on the brink of fracture, which, besides this, lacked any <b>common</b> <b>institution</b> beyond the monarchy.|$|E
