50|$|Cytochalasin B, {{the name}} of which comes from the Greek cytos (cell) and <b>chalasis</b> (relaxation), is a cell-permeable mycotoxin. It was found that substoichimetric {{concentrations}} of cytochalasin B (CB) strongly inhibit network formation by actin filaments. Due to this, it is often used in cytological research. It inhibits cytoplasmic division by blocking the formation of contractile microfilaments. It inhibits cell movement and induces nuclear extrusion. Cytochalasin B shortens actin filaments by blocking monomer addition at the fast-growing end of polymers. Cytochalasin B inhibits glucose transport and platelet aggregation. It blocks adenosine-induced apoptotic body formation without affecting activation of endogenous ADP-ribosylation in leukemia HL-60 cells.It is also used in cloning through nuclear transfer. Here enucleated recipient cells are treated with cytochalasin B. Cytochalasin B makes the cytoplasm of the oocytes more fluid and {{makes it possible to}} aspirate the nuclear genome of the oocyte within a small vesicle of plasma membrane into a micro-needle. Thereby, the oocyte genome is removed from the oocyte, while preventing rupture of the plasma membrane.|$|E
40|$|Conjunctivochalasis (Cch) is a {{very common}} ocular disorder, which can cause an {{unstable}} tear film and ocular discomfort. The study of vision-related quality of life (VR-QoL) in a community population with Cch can provide {{a better understanding of}} the impact of Cch on common people than objective clinical examinations alone. This cross-sectional comparative study enrolled 360 participants $ 40 years old living in Sanle Community, Shanghai. In the study, 198 subjects were diagnosed with Cch and 86 with dry eye syndrome (DES) without Cch. The remaining 76 subjects were normal controls. Socio-demographical data were collected, and Cch and related ocular symptoms and signs were evaluated. In addition, all participants were required to complete the Chinese version of the 25 -item National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI VFQ- 25) and Ocular Surface Disease Index Questionnaire (OSDI). Main outcome measures include the comparison on the OSDI score and VFQ- 25 score among the subgroups, and the correlation of these scores with the socio-demographical and clinical data. The results revealed that subjects with Cch had significantly decreased tear film stability even compared with those with DES (P = 0. 001). The participants with either Cch or DES reported significantly higher OSDI scores and lower VFQ- 25 composite scores than the normal controls (P, 0. 001 and 0. 007 respectively). Further comparisons among the subgroups of Cch revealed that the following factors were associated with higher OSDI scores and lower VFQ- 25 composite scores: nasal-side Cch, <b>chalasis</b> folds higher than tear meniscus height, punctal occlusion, or increased extent o...|$|E
