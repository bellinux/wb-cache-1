40|$|The depauperate fauna of Newfoundland {{provides}} a limited prey base for marten. Only two small mammal prey species, Microtus pennsylvanicus and Sorex cinereus, {{were found in}} any abundance in the old-growth forests of the study area. Of these two, Microtus displayed population fluctuations typical of most microtines. Analysis of marten scats indicated that Microtus {{is a very important}} prey item to the marten with other food. items being of lesser importance particularly when Microtus are abundant. Trapping in various habitats indicated that Sorex densities were three to five times higher in logged areas compared to uncut areas. Unfortunately, the effects of logging on Microtus could not be determined directly from this study. Microtus numbers declined drastically in the spring of 1987, apparently independently of logging operations. Microtus numbers dropped from a density of 25. 0 per hectare in the spring of 1986 to virtually zero in the spring of 1987. This reduction may be linked to an outbreak of viral encephalitus in the marten population in the fall of 1986. Marten (Martes arnericana) prefer mature coniferous and mixed forests and utilize regenerating <b>cutovers</b> minimally. The reasons for this are unclear, although prey abundance and availability may be involved. In this study, Sorex were more abundance in regenerating <b>cutovers</b> and the literature suggests that Microtus are also more abundant in these areas. This would seem to suggest that prey abundance above certain threshold densities is not critical to marten habitat selection. However, prey availability may play a more important role. Although prey species may be more abundance in logged areas, prey availability may be reduced...|$|R

40|$|Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in the {{boreal forest}} are {{believed}} to be threatened by human encroachment and associated disturbances such as resource exploration and extraction. Fifteen female woodland caribou were radiocollared and monitored in central Manitoba, from 1995 to 1997, to obtain information on their population range and distribution, movements, and habitat use in relation to forestry concerns. The population ranged over 4 600 km² within a large peatland system and concentrated their activities in two areas for both the summer and winter seasons. Females were relatively more solitary during the summer and exhibited fidelity to specific calving and summering areas averaging 83. 4 km². Individual wintering locations varied between years and among individuals. Post-rut and pre-calving mixed-sex aggregations were observed on the southern portion of the herds range. Caribou from {{the northern part of the}} range utilized a traditional travel corridor moving as far as 65 km to access the aggregation areas and their summer or winter ranges. Adult survival during the study period was high, averaging 90 %. Survival of the 1995 cohort also appeared to be high as indicated by the 0. 65 : 1 calf-cow ratio, and 30 % calf composition of observed caribou in the autumn of 1995. The annual rate of change (λ) of 1. 19 from January to November of 1995 indicated that the population was increasing at that time. Habitat selection analyses at the home range level revealed that female woodland caribou preferred lowland black spruce to most other habitats except peatlands and jack pine. During the spring and summer at the third order of selection, females exhibited preferences for both lowland black spruce and treed peatlands while avoiding <b>cutovers.</b> Data for the autumn and winter suggested that lowlands and peatlands were heavily utilized during those months. Though occasional use of young <b>cutovers</b> was noted, woodland caribou tended to avoid harvested sites. As a result of past logging practices three main habitat types were available to caribou: young stands less than five years of age with little regenerating vegetation, stands dominated by trembling aspen with a secondary component of softwoods, and jack pine dominated stands. Due to the young age and high deciduous content of most regenerating stands; habitats created by logging were better suited for moose than woodland caribou...|$|R
40|$|The {{southern}} {{boreal forest}} environment in Saskatchewan has {{been affected by}} the large-scale pulpwood harvesting operations that commenced in 1968. The present study was undertaken to assess the present environmental conditions on various terrain types with the aim of predicting the likely future forests that will develop. A biophysical inventory of approximately 5600 km 2 of forest terrain was undertaken to provide the frame of reference. Forty-one land systems based on landform, topography, texture of surficial deposits, drainage and vegetation were mapped at 1 : 125000 from air photos at 1 : 77500. Standing crop and regeneration potential of each terrain type provided a basis for predicting ecosystem development. Total stand volumes decline in the following order: > 300 m 3 ha-l on fresh sandy loam till; 250 - 300 m 3 ha- 1 on fresh outwash or moderately fine textured till; 200 - 250 m 3 ha-l on dry sandy loam outwash and moist to very moist moderately fine textured till; 150 - 200 m 3 ha-l on dry sands; < 150 m 3 ha-l on very dry outwash sands. Advance regeneration, primarily black spruce and balsam fir, does not {{play a major role in}} stand re-establishment. Cumulative actual evapotranspiration (AE) on ten important terrain types over the 1973 growing season was much higher than in 1972 due to -warmer and wetter conditions in 1973. Cumulative curves were generally sigmoid in shape with the most rapid rise coinciding with leaf expansion of broad-leaved vegetation. A plateau was attained in early to mid-August which coincides with cessation of height and diameter growth. Curve slopes in mid-summer were correlated with soil moisture holding capacity and/or stage of vegetation development. Recent <b>cutovers</b> and/or dry sandy sites had flatter curve slopes than 5 -year-old <b>cutovers</b> or moist sandy loam till sites. Daily rates of AE in 1973 (May 1 to August 31) ranged up to 5 mm. Semi-monthly estimates of AE, which were calculated from the cumulative curves, indicate moisture environemnts of significant length in determining regeneration success. Water stress reduces germination and growth of regeneration. Ratio of AE to potential evapotranspiration (PE) is one measure of stress; the magnitude is influenced by growing season weather and available soil water capacity. Ratios progressively decreased in the following order: sandy clay loam till, washed sandy loam till and sandy lacustrine or outwash terrain. Comparative ecological studies of white spruce and jack pine seedlings in greenhouse and field revealed morphological and physiological differences. Pine had deeper taproots and greater root mass than white spruce. Control of water loss and enhanced drought avoidance are suggested by pine leaf water characteristic curves. White spruce consistently developed higher stresses than pine in the field under similar weather conditions. Stresses for both species were highest on coarse textured soils. Pine strategy favours drought avoidance and that of spruce favours growth. July precipitation and temperature regimes of the previous year correlate well with current-year height increments of jack pine, white and black spruce seedlings. Wet to very wet conditions (precipitation more than 2 cm above normal) appear most favourable for growth. Integration of the various studies suggests that species conversion and/or stand degradation is unlikely except under extreme environments on moist sandy clay loam till supporting mixedwood forests or in black spruce forests on wet, organic flats. Specific silvicultural recommendations are made for major terrain types. Greatest regeneration problems occur on moist lower, slopes and very moist to wet flats of till plains. Maximum size of <b>cutovers</b> should be 50 and 25 ha respectively. Recommended site preparation includes scalping or trenching on the former and scarification followed by artificial reforestation on the latter...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} boreal forests have been {{harvested}} {{to retain a}} portion of the original canopy, thereby providing forest struc-ture, mostly for biodiversity reasons. Boreal mixedwood <b>cutovers</b> were surveyed at one and five years after harvesting with approximately 10 % structural retention, to quantify the mean annual mortality rates of the residual trembling aspen, bal-sam poplar, paper birch and white spruce trees. For comparison,“natural ” mortality rates by species were estimated from permanent sample plots in stands of similar composition. Species ranking of the annual mortality rates of residuals in areas harvested with structural retention were: poplar (10. 2 %) > birch (8. 7 %) > aspen (6. 1 %) > spruce (2. 9 %). Annual mortality rates were 2. 5 to 4 times greater than in the reference stands. The majority of broadleaved species died as snags (~ 70 %– 90 %), while most spruce died due to windthrow (80 %). Mortality rates increased with slenderness coefficient for codominant and understory poplar and for understory birch. For aspen, codominants were most likely to die, while in spruce, dominant trees and trees with the greatest damage to the bole from harvesting operations had the highest mor-tality...|$|R
50|$|<b>Cutovers</b> from forest {{harvesting}} {{have been}} identified as the strongest predictor of caribou extirpation. This was not surprising; the northern front of forest harvesting in Ontario closely matches the southern boundary of continuous caribou occupancy and timber harvesting may lead to reduced occurrence of woodland caribou. However, {{there appears to be a}} time lag between forest harvest and disappearance of caribou. Research suggests that there is a two decade time lag between disturbance by forest harvest and disappearance of caribou. Forest harvest converts forest stands to early seral stages, which are favoured by moose, which in turn can support a higher wolf population than caribou alone. A higher wolf population may increase predation mortality of caribou. Thus, two decades is likely the time necessary for these faunal changes to take place. This time lag is cause for concern, as there is overlap of forest harvest with the southern boundary of caribou range in Ontario. Caribou in these areas are very likely to vanish in the next 20 years. While patterns of forest harvest show the strongest relationship with caribou extirpation in Ontario, strong correlations among landscape disturbances suggest that no single variable can be unequivocally implicated as key to caribou range recession.|$|R
50|$|While {{balsam fir}} is {{undoubtedly}} {{the host of}} preference, severe outbreaks {{have occurred in the}} Prairie Provinces and Northwest Territories in white spruce stands containing little or no balsam fir (Ives and Wong 1988). In severe outbreaks in north-central Ontario, young white spruce and black spruce outplants in <b>cutovers</b> became infested with dozens of late-stage larvae (Sutton 1982). Mortality among white spruce has also occurred in northwestern Ontario and the Algoma District of Ontario, as well as in certain areas of New Brunswick (Blais 1976). An ambitious study to determine (1) the degree of vulnerability of white spruce to budworm attack, (2) the rate of mortality with respect to defoliation, stand age and composition, geographical location, and relative to mortality among balsam fir, (3) sequence of attack by secondary insects, and (4) the rate of deterioration of killed trees, was begun in 1975 (Blais 1976) when 10 line plots 60 m wide averaging 0.5 km in length were established in mature stands of white spruce about 14 km apart along bush roads in the Dumoine and Coulonge river watersheds of western Quebec.

5000|$|J. Hall's (1970) {{report on}} the state of site {{preparation}} in Ontario noted that blades and rakes were found to be well suited to post-cut scarification in tolerant hardwood stands for natural regeneration of yellow birch. Plows were most effective for treating dense brush prior to planting, often in conjunction with a planting machine. Scarifying teeth, e.g., Young's teeth, were sometimes used to prepare sites for planting, but their most effective use was found to be preparing sites for seeding, particularly in backlog areas carrying light brush and dense herbaceous growth. Rolling choppers found application in treating heavy brush but could be used only on stone-free soils. Finned drums were commonly used on jack pine-spruce <b>cutovers</b> on fresh brushy sites with a deep duff layer and heavy slash, and they needed to be teamed with a tractor pad unit to secure good distribution of the slash. The S.F.I. scarifier, after strengthening, had been [...] "quite successful" [...] for 2 years, promising trials were under way with the cone scarifier and barrel ring scarifier, and development had begun on a new flail scarifier for use on sites with shallow, rocky soils. Recognition of the need to become more effective and efficient in site preparation led the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests to adopt the policy of seeking and obtaining for field testing new equipment from Scandinavia and elsewhere that seemed to hold promise for Ontario conditions, primarily in the north. Thus, testing was begun of the Brackekultivator from Sweden and the Vako-Visko rotary furrower from Finland.|$|R
40|$|Increased {{awareness}} of the key ecological role of natural disturbance in maintaining ecological integrity and function coupled with forest harvesting becoming a dominant disturbance process has lead to an increasing desire to study natural disturbance at multiple scales. The eventual goal is to design harvesting regimes that achieve the ecological conditions that are maintained in nature by natural disturbance. Legacies of natural disturbance such as unburned forest remnants left by wildfire commonly occur scattered throughout large wildfires. The objective of this dissertation {{is to develop a}} better understanding of the role of unburned forest remnants in providing ecological diversity and sources of natural conifer regeneration. Two separate studies were undertaken. The first study characterized remnant habitats and compared them to large contiguous patches of remnant free young, mature and old forest. The second study examined post-fire recruitment surrounding remnant patches of Douglas-fir. Remnants could be discriminated from other stand types based on measures of tree and snag density. Some remnants displayed a unique unevenaged lodgepole pine regeneration structure compared to other stand types. Differences between remnants and other stand types appear to stem from the influence of the wildfire through which they survived. Remnants displayed high variability in all ecological variables examined which appears to relate to the variable influence of wildfire on them. Remnants share many ecological characteristics with old forest and thus could provide some of the same functions. Douglas-fir remnants provide a positive influence on Douglas-fir recruitment in the post fire regenerating forest. Patches of mature forest left in managed <b>cutovers</b> could serve similar functions as wildfire remnants. However, selection and management criteria must be developed to ensure that the ecological characteristics of wildfire remnants are duplicated within these reserves. The alternate regeneration dynamics demonstrated by some remnants could provide a model for the development of an alternate silviculture system for lodgepole pine dominated stands. There are many limitations to our ability to incorporate characteristics of natural disturbance into managed forests. For instance, removal of the trees to make wood products restricts our ability to leave large numbers of standing snags. However, leaving patches of trees behind which emulate the ecological characteristics of island remnants is achievable and can bring us closer towards achieving ecological sustainability in the managed forest.
