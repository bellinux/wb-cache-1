40|$|For the forty-nine {{moderate}} and severe typhoons, which {{landed on the}} Japanese main is-lands from 1951 to 1984, the Schloemer's type pressure patterns are fitted to the observed sea-levelpressures. At the time of landfall, cumulative probabilities of /p (central pressure depth), rm(radius of the maximum <b>cyclostrophic</b> <b>wind),</b> speed and direction of forward motion are re-presented by a normal distribution in the logarithmic scale. And, the distribution of numberof landed typhoons per year is fitted by the Poisson's distribution. Further, the distributionsof a mean time change rate to a value {{at the time of}} landfall is investigated for /p, rm andspeed of forward motion, and the distribution of a mean time change value of direction of for-ward motion is investigated. These investigated results will be applied to a simulation of pres-sure field and track of a typhoon, and the wind speed in a typhoon will be estimated using arelation between the pressure pattern and the wind field...|$|E
40|$|High spatial {{resolution}} thermal infrared (TIR) images derived by the LANDSAT Thematic Mapper (TM) sensors show {{the presence of}} numerous small-scale eddies near the Kuril Islands. As the diameters of these eddies range from around 2 to 30 km (i. e., submesoscale), they are {{much smaller than the}} eddies previously reported in this region (several tens to some hundreds of kilometers in diameter). Our simulations suggest that small-scale eddies similar to those observed in the satellite data are generated by diurnal barotropic tides. The eddy generation is well defined from Etorofu/Friza to the Onnekotan Straits, and it is caused by the effects of coastal boundaries and the stretching of water columns, which lead to eddy growth even after eddies have left the coast. We find that the counterclockwise eddies are generally larger in number and size and stronger in vorticity and surface height than the clockwise eddies in both the gradient and <b>cyclostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> balance regimes. The possible causes of such asymmetry are (1) the effect of planetary-vorticity tube stretching, which can be significant even when the final relative vorticity becomes much greater than planetary vorticity and (2) asymmetric advection by the rotating tidal flow, which advects counterclockwise eddies offshore but clockwise eddies onshore. These eddies induce strong stirring with a maximum apparent diffusivity of 10 ^[8] cm 2 s^[- 1]. The numbers, properties, and mixing effects of eddies vary greatly with the spring-neap cycle...|$|E
30|$|The altitudes of the {{features}} seen in day- and nightside images are not known with certainty. From analysis of PVO polarization data, the aerosol unit optical depth is at about 28  mb or at about 71  km in equatorial regions and at about 40 mb (~  68  km) in polar regions (Kawabata et al. 1980). From the analysis of 1.6 -µm VIRTIS data, Ignatiev et al. (2009) found the cloud tops located at 74  ±  1  km in low and midlatitudes and at 63 – 69  km poleward of ±  50 ° latitude. Tracking clouds and matching their zonal speeds to entry probe zonal wind from Pioneer Venus probes or <b>cyclostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> from thermal structure data have often been invoked to estimate the vertical level of {{the features}} (Belton et al. 1991; Hueso et al. 2015; Limaye 1985). Using a cloud model, Takagi and Iwagami (2011) have explored the causes for contrasts in the images acquired by IR 1 and IR 2 Akatsuki cameras in near infrared at 0.9 and 2.02  µm on the dayside and at 2.26  µm on the nightside. They concluded that the dayside 0.9  µm contrasts are due to variations of the cloud optical thickness as {{is also the case}} for the nightside 2.26  µm contrasts. They suggest that 2.02  µm contrasts depend on not only the cloud altitude, but also the cloud optical thickness. They also suggest that although Belton et al. (1991) inferred that dayside 0.986  µm contrasts correspond to about 55  km using the vertical wind shear, the contrasts could be located anywhere in the cloud from 48 to 70  km. Similarly, although Carlson et al. (1991) attribute the 2.3  µm contrasts to 50  km, Takagi and Iwagami (2011) suggest that the contrasts may be located anywhere in the mid- or upper cloud region. Hueso et al. (2015) attribute the cloud patterns between 0.3 and 1  µm to altitudes between 60 and 72  km and their near-infrared cloud motion measurements match those from the Pioneer Venus probe and VeGa balloon derived winds at altitudes between 56 and 62  km, differing from the 58 – 64  km level derived by (Sánchez-Lavega et al. 2008) from radiative calculations. It is quite possible that these discrepancies are due to temporal and local time variations or from the global variations in the cloud structure (as indicated by the Akatsuki nightside images) that can be at odds with cloud models deployed to infer the altitudes.|$|E

40|$|Titan's middle {{atmosphere}} {{is characterized by}} <b>cyclostrophic</b> <b>winds</b> and strong seasonal modulation. Cassini CIRS observations, obtained in northern winter, indicate that the stratosphere near l mbar is warmest at low latitudes, with the South Pole a few degrees colder and the North Pole approximately 20 K colder. Associated with the cold northern temperatures are strong circumpolar winds with speeds as high as 190 m/s. Within this vortex, the mixing ratios of several organic gases are enhanced relative to those at low latitudes. Comparison with Voyager thermal infrared measurements, obtained 25 years ago in northern spring, suggests that the enhancement currently observed will increase as the winter progresses. The stratopause height, increases from 0. 1 mbar near the equator to 0. 01 mbar near the North Pole, where it is the warmest part of the atmosphere, greater than 200 K. This implies subsidence at the pole, {{which is consistent with}} the enhanced organics observed. Condensate features, several still not identified, are also apparent in the infrared spectra at high northern latitudes. In many ways, the winter vortex observed on Titan, with <b>cyclostrophic</b> <b>winds,</b> resembles the polar winter vortices on the Earth, where the mean winds are geostrophic...|$|R

40|$|Temperatures and {{pressures}} inferred from radio occultation data {{acquired by the}} Pioneer Venus orbiter between September 1982 and November 1983 are used to derive <b>cyclostrophic</b> zonal <b>winds</b> in the middle atmosphere of Venus (1350 to 2. 1 mb, 10 deg to 70 deg latitude). The main feature of the wind field is a jet positioned just above the cloud tops at 70 km and approximately 48 deg latitude. The maximum speed of the jet is about 130 m/s. A comparison with results of similar analyses on Pioneer Venus radio occultation data obtained between December 1978 and October 1981 suggests an equatorward shift of the jet {{and a decrease in}} jet speed during this five-year time interval. It is proposed that the poleward transport of westward zonal momentum by the upper branch of the cloud level Hadley cell supplies the excess momentum of the jet and maintains it against dissipation. The location of the jet thereby provides a minimum estimate of the latitudinal extent of the Hadley cell. <b>Cyclostrophic</b> zonal <b>wind</b> velocities decrease with height above about 70 - 75 km. It is suggested that this deceleration of the superrotation in equatorial latitudes is due to the dissipation of vertically propagating thermal tides forced primarily at altitudes around 65 km...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{studies of}} Jupiter and Saturn often {{emphasize}} their similarities, but recent observations have highlighted important differences. The stratospheres of both planets exhibit an equatorial oscillation reminiscent {{of that in}} Earth's middle atmosphere. Jupiter's oscillation has a 4 - 5 year period, not linked to its season, {{and it has been}} modeled as an analog to the terrestrial quasi-biennial oscillation, driven by the stresses associated with vertically propagating waves. Saturn's equatorial oscillation is nearly semiannual, but wave activity may still be a driver. Jupiter's internal rotation rate is inferred from its steady modulated radio emission. Saturn's internal rotation is more enigmatic. It has been inferred from the modulation of the body's kilometric radio emission, but this period has varied by 1 % over the last 25 years. Saturn's equatorial winds are also puzzling, as those inferred from cloud tracking by Cassini and more recent HST observations are weaker than those from Voyager. Whether this is attributable to a difference in altitudes of the tracked clouds in winds with vertical shear or a real temporal change in the winds is not known. Both winter and summer poles of Saturn exhibit very compact circumpolar vortices with warm cores, indicating subsidence. Titan's middle atmosphere is characterized by global <b>cyclostrophic</b> <b>winds,</b> particularly the strong circumpolar vortex in the winter hemisphere. In many ways, the spatial distribution of temperature, gaseous constituents, and condensates is reminiscent of conditions in terrestrial winter vortices, albeit with different chemistry.

40|$|In {{the lower}} {{atmosphere}} of Titan IR brightness temperatures exhibit meridional contrast less than approximately 3 K. Seasonal variations are absent {{because of the}} large radiative time constant. In the upper stratosphere meridional contrasts are approximately 20 K, consistent with 100 m/s <b>cyclostrophic</b> zonal <b>winds,</b> and the radiative time constant is short, implying a large seasonal variation in the temperature and wind field. The absence of longitudinal thermal structure implies that zonally symmetric flows effect the meridional transport of heat. A simple model yields meridional velocities approximately 0. 04 cm/s and vertical eddy viscosities approximately 1, 000 sq cm/s in the lower troposphere, and meridional velocities approximately 5 cm/s in the upper stratosphere...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{circulation}} model of Venus' atmosphere to couple the super-rotating cloud tops and upper thermosphere. To drive these simulations, we formulate the first continuous semi-empirical model of atmospheric structure between 60 - 250 km. Our model hydrostatically links the VIRA and VTS 3 models. Our approach is validated by comparisons with observations {{where we find}} a good agreement with data. We base our dynamic model on the Müller-Wodarg et al. [2003] general circulation model (GCM) of Titan's thermosphere. Our simulations solve the full non-linear Navier-Stokes momentum equation assuming a realistic thermal structure and lower boundary super-rotation. We find our derived winds are consistent {{with much of the}} data between 70 - 120 km. Solving the full momentum equation we find dynamics below 80 km are predominately cyclostrophic. Near 75 km we find a good agreement between our GCM, cyclostrophic and cloud tracked winds between 45 - 85 ⁰ latitude. Equatorward of 30 ⁰ <b>cyclostrophic</b> <b>winds</b> decrease steeply with latitude. This is not seen in our GCM winds, which are sustained by an equatorward transport of momentum, neglected in the cyclostrophic approximation. Above 80 km we find a balance of advection and pressure gradients replaces cyclostrophic balance poleward of (50 - 60 ⁰). Above 75 km a pole-to-equator temperature gradient drives equatorward winds with peak speeds of 100 ms⁻ 1 near 95 km, and zonal winds decrease with height. Zonal forcing above 90 km drives a reversal in dayside meridional winds and accelerates a subsolar-to-antisolar flow. We find the winds between 90 - 150 km are not characterised by a simple balance of accelerations. Above 150 km we find a symmetric subsolar-to-antisolar flow, characterised by a balance of horizontal pressure gradients and viscosity with 200 ms⁻ 1 cross terminator winds. Our simulations address the origin of the thermospheric super-rotation. We find the cloud top super-rotation does not propagate above 100 km, nor is a super-rotation above 150 km driven in situ by our pressure gradients.

40|$|The {{profusion of}} {{observational}} data made {{available by the}} Venus Express and previous space missions, increases our need to develop numerical tools to interpret the data and improve {{our understanding of the}} Venus meteorology. The main objective of this work is to develop an improved Venus general circulation model and to study the most likely mechanisms driving the atmosphere to the current observed circulation. Our new model is an extension of a simplified version and includes a new radiative transfer scheme and convection and an adapted boundary layer scheme and dynamical core that take into account the dependence of the heat capacity with temperature, at constant atmospheric pressure. The new radiative transfer formulation implemented is more suitable for Venus climate studies than previous works due to its easy adaptability to different atmospheric conditions. This flexibility of the model was very important in this work to explore the uncertainties on the lower atmospheric conditions such as the gas absorption and the possible presence of aerosols near the surface. The new general circulation model obtains, after long periods of integration, a super-rotation phenomenon in the cloud region quantitatively similar to the one observed. However, this phenomenon is sensitive to some radiative parameters such as the amount of the solar radiative energy absorbed by the surface and the amount of clouds. The super-rotation in the model is formed due to the combined influence of the zonal mean circulation, thermal tides and transient waves, and the main mechanisms involved are identified and studied. In this process the momentum transported by the semidiurnal tide excited in the upper clouds has a key contribution. These migrating waves transport prograde momentum mainly from the upper atmosphere to the cloud region. In this work we also explored the model parameters {{to gain a better understanding}} of the effect of topography, the diurnal cycle and convective momentum mixing. In general the results showed that: the topography seemed capable of sustaining stronger global super-rotation; without diurnal cycle the strong winds in the cloud region are not produced; the convective momentum mixing experiment did not lead to significant changes. A simple experiment done advecting the UV absorber in the atmosphere, qualitatively showed several atmospheric phenomena that are important for the distribution of clouds. Among them is the presence of a region of low permeability isolating the polar vortex. This last experiment also showed that when increasing the amount of UV absorption in the upper cloud region the winds get stronger. Following the interpretation of observational data using numerical models, we also used a simplified version of the general circulation model to assess the accuracy of zonal wind retrievals from measured temperatures using the <b>cyclostrophic</b> thermal <b>wind</b> equation in the Venus mesosphere. From this analysis we suggest a method which better estimates the lower boundary condition, and improves the consistency of the results at high latitudes when compared with cloud tracking measurements.
