The other, Benjamin Harrison, was in office {{at the time that the}} change was made.

5|$|<b>Courts</b> {{are divided}} into three categories: civil, religious, and special.

The civil <b>courts</b> include Magistrate <b>Courts,</b> <b>Courts</b> of First Instance, <b>Courts</b> of Appeal, High Administrative <b>Courts</b> which hear cases relating to administrative matters, and the Constitutional Court which {{was set up in}} 2012 in order to hear cases regarding the constitutionality of laws. Although Islam is the state religion, the constitution preserves a degree of religious and personal freedom. Religious law only extends to matters of personal status such as divorce and inheritance in religious <b>courts,</b> and is partially based on Islamic Sharia law. The special court deals with cases forwarded by the civil one.|$|E

5|$|Oregon’s state <b>courts</b> are <b>courts</b> {{of general}} jurisdiction, unlike federal <b>courts.</b> That is, the state <b>courts</b> can hear all cases {{regardless}} of whether the dispute is based on state law, federal law, or a combination of both, with a few exceptions. Thus the Oregon Supreme Court can hear appeals for cases based on both federal and state law. Although the U.S. Supreme Court is the only court that can overturn decisions of the Oregon court, Oregon Supreme Court decisions as to federal law are only binding on other Oregon state level <b>courts.</b> Federal <b>courts</b> are not required to follow the decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for decisions based on federal law, regardless as to if the federal court is located within the state. However, federal <b>courts</b> are bound to follow Oregon law and decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for cases that involve disputes based on Oregon law, even when those federal <b>courts</b> are not based in Oregon, per the Erie Doctrine developed by the U.S. Supreme Court. For this reason federal <b>courts,</b> and <b>courts</b> from other states, can certify questions about Oregon law to the Oregon Supreme Court in order to clarify what the law in Oregon is in regards to the specific fact pattern that the federal court has before it in their case (see ORS 28.200 to 28.255 and ORAP 12.20).|$|E
