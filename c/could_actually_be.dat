Crests are now generally not granted unless they <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> used on a physical helm, and the rules about directions of helms are no longer rigidly observed.|$|E
5|$|Once it was {{determined}} that dry berthing was physically possible for the ship, it was necessary to make a preliminary evaluation of the engineering viable ways in which dry berthing <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> accomplished. Again, an independent maritime engineering firm was contracted to study the full range of dry berth alternatives and to present a report of their findings to BTF and to TPWD.|$|E
5|$|In {{pictures}} {{taken by the}} Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, the motion of M87's jet was measured at four to six times the speed of light. This motion is presumably an optical illusion caused by the relativistic velocity of the jet, and not true superluminal motion. However, detection of such motion supports the theory that quasars, BL Lacertae objects and radio galaxies may all be the same phenomenon, known as active galaxies, viewed from different perspectives. It has been proposed M87 <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> a BL Lacertae object (with a low-luminosity nucleus compared with the brightness of its host galaxy) seen from an unfavorable angle to appreciate the properties {{of that kind of}} galaxy.|$|E

25|$|Leprosy {{was once}} {{believed}} to be highly contagious and was treated with mercury—as was syphilis, which was first described in 1530. Many early cases thought to <b>be</b> leprosy <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> have <b>been</b> syphilis.|$|R
5|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that the {{universe}} is well described by four-dimensional spacetime, there are several reasons why physicists consider theories in other dimensions. In some cases, by modeling spacetime in a different number of dimensions, a theory becomes more mathematically tractable, and one can perform calculations and gain general insights more easily. There are also situations where theories in two or three spacetime dimensions are useful for describing phenomena in condensed matter physics. Finally, there exist scenarios in which there <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> more than four dimensions of spacetime which have nonetheless managed to escape detection.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of Pan-Asianism, met Japanese premier Count Terauchi and Count Okuma, a former premier, in an attempt to enlist support for the Ghadarite movement. Tarak Nath Das urged Japan to align with Germany, on the grounds that American war preparation <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> directed against Japan. Later in 1915, Abani Mukherji— a Jugantar activist and associate of Rash Behari Bose— is also known to have tried unsuccessfully to arrange for arms from Japan.|$|E
5|$|The Corporal had {{numerous}} limitations. It {{took a long}} time to set up, so it could not engage targets of opportunity; there could be delays in the countdown process, which made it hard to warn the troops to close their eyes or aircraft to avoid the area; and it was guided by a radio beam that not only could be jammed, but <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> diverted. Moreover, during test firings in the Outer Hebrides, although eight out of twelve missiles accurately hit their targets, four fell short, which is always regrettable but particularly so when nuclear weapons are involved in view of the danger it posed to one's own troops. A new British project was therefore launched to develop a better missile, codenamed Blue Water, which was to have used the British Indigo Hammer and later the Tony warhead.|$|E
50|$|Promylaia ("the {{one that}} stands before/protects the mill") was {{another name for}} a goddess of the mills, who was worshipped {{in the same fashion}} as Eunostus. Both Eunostus and Promylaia <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> have <b>been</b> mere epithets of Demeter.|$|R

5|$|The Progress Party has {{historically}} sometimes been portrayed externally as a populist or right-wing populist party (or other similar terms), both by opposing politicians, {{as well as}} some scholars. Depending on definitions of populism, other scholars have however found that populism is at best a minor element of the party, or that its policies historically have been more consistent than for instance those of the Labour Party, which has moved more towards the Progress Party and neoliberalism since the 1980s. Political scientist Anders Todal Jensen has argued that the Progress Party is the only populist party in Norway, with all the other parties in contrast having strong elitist foundations. He has suggested that populism <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> a sign of health as the structures of the traditional parties make them poorly able to “listen to the people” in the same manner that the Progress Party may.|$|E
5|$|The {{shoulder}} of Acrocanthosaurus was {{limited in its}} range of motion {{compared to that of}} humans. The arm could not swing in a complete circle, but could retract (swing backwards) 109° from the vertical, so that the humerus <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> angled slightly upwards. Protraction (swinging forward) was limited to only 24° past the vertical. The arm was unable to reach a vertical position when adducting (swinging downwards), but could abduct (swing upwards) to 9° above horizontal. Movement at the elbow was also limited compared to humans, with a total range of motion of only 57°. The arm could not completely extend (straighten), nor could it flex (bend) very far, with the humerus unable even to form a right angle with the forearm. The radius and ulna (forearm bones) locked together so that there was no possibility of pronation or supination (twisting) as in human forearms.|$|E
5|$|In December 1283 in Gniezno, {{at the age}} of 22 or 23 years, Ludgarda, wife of Przemysł II, died unexpectedly. Relations {{between the}} spouses for some time before her death weren't very good; perhaps there had even been a {{separation}} between them. The reason for this was the supposed infertility of Ludgarda, more apparent after ten years of marriage. The actual period of marital intercourse between the spouses given their age (both are quite young {{at the time of their}} wedding) <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> shorter. Indeed, there is no direct proof about Ludgarda's barrenness beyond the lack of offspring; in those, the childlessness in marriage was usually considered to be the woman's fault, although in this case (due to the birth of a daughter from Przemysł II's second marriage), it seems more likely. It wasn't a surprise when accusations began to emerge against the Duke of Greater Poland of the suspected murder of his wife. It must be noted, however, that no contemporary source mentions this, a fact more surprising because Przemysł II had bitter enemies who certainly would use this crime against him. Also any reactions from church or public penance would noticed.|$|E

50|$|In 1895 Msgr Brochu {{purchased}} land at {{the corner}} of Main and Marcy for the new church. Part of the purchase agreement stipulated that the church <b>could</b> not <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> built until after the death of Mr. Marcy, the prior owner. As a result Msgr Brochu, who died in 1904 was unable to begin construction which was eventually undertaken by his successor, Msgr Louis O. Trigonne after Mr. Marcy died in 1908.|$|R

50|$|Many {{films were}} based on Mahabharata in Telugu; the {{difference}} between those films {{and this one is}} the characterization of Duryodhana. While making the Sree Krishna Pandaveeyam itself, NTR projected Duryodhana as 'Suyodhana' with a positive touch to the role. In this film, he projected Duryodhana as a well-educated person who knew dharma and other things much better than anyone. Some people even say that the title of the movie <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> have <b>been</b> Maanadhana Veera Suyodhana — such is the importance and characterization of Suyodhana.|$|R
40|$|This Article has two goals. The {{first is}} to explain in some detail what {{copyright}} law might look like if it reflected economic reasoning.

25|$|Until the 1950s, the {{question}} of whether one could in fact infer the existence of unwritten doctrines from the ancient sources stood {{at the center of the}} discussion. After the Tübingen School introduced its new paradigm, a vigorous controversy arose and debate shifted to the new question of whether the Tübingen Hypothesis was correct: that the unwritten doctrines <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> reconstructed and contained the core of Plato's philosophy.|$|E
25|$|It {{was long}} thought that q was positive, {{indicating}} that the expansion is slowing down due to gravitational attraction. This would imply an age of the Universe less than 1/H (which is about 14 billion years). For instance, a value for q of 1/2 (once favoured by most theorists) would give {{the age of the}} Universe as 2/(3H). The discovery in 1998 that q is apparently negative means that the Universe <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> older than 1/H. However, estimates of {{the age of the universe}} are very close to 1/H.|$|E

25|$|The Ming dynasty (January 23, 1368 – April 25, 1644), officially the Great Ming or Empire of the Great Ming, {{founded by}} the peasant rebel leader Zhu Yuanzhang, known as the Hongwu Emperor, was an {{imperial}} dynasty of China. It was the successor to the Yuan dynasty and the predecessor of the short-lived Shun dynasty, which was in turn succeeded by the Qing dynasty.

25|$|Two Canadian {{studies have}} shown that the natural trans fat vaccenic acid, found in beef and dairy products, <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> {{beneficial}} compared to hydrogenated vegetable shortening, or a mixture of pork lard and soy fat, by lowering total and LDL and triglyceride levels. A study by the US Department of Agriculture showed that vaccenic acid raises both HDL and LDL cholesterol, whereas industrial trans fats only raise LDL without any beneficial effect on HDL. In light of recognized evidence and scientific agreement, nutritional authorities consider all trans fats equally harmful for health and recommend that consumption of trans fats be reduced to trace amounts.|$|E

25|$|A further {{limitation}} of the correlation {{is that it does}} not necessarily imply that the causality runs from income to health. It <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> that better health, as proxied by life expectancy, contributes to higher incomes, rather than vice versa. Better health can increase incomes because healthier individuals tend to be more productive than sick ones; on average they work harder, longer and are more capable of focusing efficiently on production tasks. Furthermore, better health may affect not just the level of income but also its growth rate through its effect on education. Healthier children spend more time at school and learn faster, thus acquiring more human capital which translates into higher growth rates of incomes later in life. Diseases such as malaria can short circuit these processes. Likewise there is evidence that more healthy individuals save more and thus contribute to the faster accumulation of physical capital of an economy. Jeffrey Sachs in particular has emphasized the role that the disease burden has played in the impoverishment of countries located in the tropical zones.|$|E

5000|$|There was {{an issue}} raised on {{same-sex}} marriages, etc. It is true {{we do not have}} a law allowing same-sex marriages in our country, and that I say again, due to our own traditions and very cultural strong beliefs.
