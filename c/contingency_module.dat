For {{the evaluation of the}} system with users, we considered a <b>contingency</b> <b>module</b> that is developed to elicit tutoring behavior, which we then evaluate by implementing this module on the robotic platform iCub and within an interaction with the users. For the evaluation of our system, we consider not only the participant's behavior but also the system's log-files as dependent variables (as it was suggested in [15] for the improvement of HRI design). We further applied Sequential Analysis as a qualitative method that provides micro-analytical insights into the sequential structure of the interaction. This way, we are able to investigate a closer interrelationship between robot's and tutor's actions and how they respond to each other. We focus on two cases: In the first case, the system module was reacting to the interaction partner appropriately; in the second case, the <b>contingency</b> <b>module</b> failed to spot the tutor. We found that the <b>contingency</b> <b>module</b> enables the robot to engage in an interaction with the human tutor who orients to the robot's conduct as appropriate and responsive. In contrast, when the robot did not engage in an appropriate responsive interaction, the tutor oriented more towards the object while gazing less at the robot...|$|E

The implementation of the two parts rely on a hybrid method called SIME, coupled with a time domain simulation engine and power flow program. The speed up of the <b>contingency</b> screening <b>module</b> is obtained by distributing contingencies on a cluster of computers to comply with extended real-time speed requirements. A compensation scheme is used to determine active power rescheduling alternatives in order to stabilize the dangerous contingencies identified at the screening step.

This handbook is not intended to override or contradict any applicable regulation, policy, or standard operating procedure, nor is it intended to cover contingency contracting principles from A-Z. For an overview of contingency contracting fundamentals, see the USSOCOM <b>Contingency</b> Contracting <b>Module</b> or <b>Contingency</b> Contracting-A Joint Handbook for the 21 st Century. As an acquisition professional, a CCO should always practice responsible stewardship, flexibility, and adaptability to best support mission objectives. While this handbook will provide examples, possible solution sets, and guiding principles for successful construction management by a CCO, no two contingency experiences are the same. Thus, this handbook is intended to help the CCO operate with a synergistic approach to integrating the joint capabilities of the expeditionary environment. Acquisition Research Progra...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Research {{on social}} {{cognition}} needs {{to overcome a}} disciplinary disintegration. On the one hand, in cognitive science and philosophy of mind – even in recent embodied approaches – the explanatory weight is still overly on individual capacities. In social science on the other hand, {{the investigation of the}} interaction process and interactional behaviour is not often brought to bear on individual aspects of social cognition. Not bringing these approaches together has unfairly limited the range of possible explanations of social understanding to the postulation of complicated internal mechanisms (<b>contingency</b> detection <b>modules</b> for instance). Starting from the question What is a social interaction? we propose a fresh look at the problem aimed at integrating individual cognition and the interaction process in order to arrive at more parsimonious explanations of social understanding. We show how an enactive framework can provide a way to do this, starting from the notions of autonomy, sense-making and coordination. We propose that not only each individual in a social encounter but also the interaction process itself has autonomy. Examples illustrate that these autonomies evolv...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{ability to}} detect a human’s {{contingent}} response is an essential skill for a social robot attempt-ing to engage new interaction partners or maintain on-going turn-taking interactions. Prior work on contin-gency detection focuses on single cues from isolated channels, such as changes in gaze, motion, or sound. We propose a framework that integrates multiple cues for detecting contingency from multimodal sensor data in human-robot interaction scenarios. We describe three levels of integration and discuss our method for per-forming sensor fusion at each of these levels. We per-form a Wizard-of-Oz data collection experiment in a turn-taking scenario in which our humanoid robot plays the turn-taking imitation game “Simon says ” with hu-man partners. Using this data set, which includes mo-tion and body pose cues from a depth and color im-age and audio cues from a microphone, we evaluate our <b>contingency</b> detection <b>module</b> with the proposed inte-gration mechanisms and show gains in accuracy of our multi-cue approach over single-cue contingency detec-tion. We show the importance of selecting the appropri-ate level of cue integration {{as well as the}} implications of varying the referent event parameter. ONR YIP N 000140810842...|$|R

40|$|This project report {{describes}} a hybrid genetic algorithm that {{works as a}} schedule generator for a complex robotic harvesting task. The task is set to a dynamic environment with a robotic opponent, making responsiveness of the planning algorithm particularly important. To solve this task, many previous scheduling algorithms were studied. Genetic algorithms have successfully been used in many dynamic scheduling tasks, due {{to their ability to}} incrementally adapt and optimize solutions when changes are made to the environment. Many of the previous approaches also used a separate heuristic to quicly adapt solutions to the new environment, making the algorithm more responsive. In addition, the study of previous work revealed the importance of population diversity when making a responsive genetic algorithm. Implementation was based on a genetic algorithm made as the author's fifth year specialization project for solving a static version of the same task. This algorithm was hybridized with a powerful local search technique that proved essential in generating good solutions for the complex harvesting task. When extending the algorithm to also work in a dynamically changing environment, several adaptations and extensions needed to be made, to make it more responsive. The extensions and adaptations include a fast-response heuristic for immediate adaptation to environmental changes, a decrease in genotype size to speed up local searches and a <b>contingency</b> planning <b>module</b> intending to solve problems before they arise. Experiments proved that the implemented dynamic planner successfully adapted its plans to a changing environment, clearly showing improvements compared to running a static plan. Further experiments also proved that the dynamic planner was able to deal with erroneous time estimates in its simulator module in a good way. Experiments on contingency planning gave no clear results, but indicated that using computational resources for planning ahead may be a good choice, if the contingency to plan for is carefully selected. As no unequivocal results were obtained, further studies of combining genetic algorithms and contingency planning may be an interesting task for future efforts. </p...|$|R

H 577 P EE 2015 Jiaxx, 154, 25 pages :color illustrationsSuccessful {{development}} of smart grid demands strengthened system security and reliability, which requires effective security analysis in conducting system operation and expansion planning. Classical N- 1 criterion {{has been widely}} {{used in the past}} to examine every creditable contingency through detailed computations. However, the adequacy of such approach becomes doubtful in facing with many recent blackouts where cascading outages are usually involved. This may be attributed to the increased complexities and nonlinearities involved in operating conditions and topological structures in the context of smart grid development. Thus far, existing literatures on multiple contingency (N-k) analysis show a lack of comprehensiveness to address topological changes of transmission networks in different contingency scenarios, and post-contingency risk (e. g. risk of potential cascading failures), etc. Most existing methods are less effective to accommodate more stringent security standards, which suffer from heavy computational burden, inaccuracy of N-k contingency screening, or both of them. Further, in large-scale electric power networks, such security analysis can be even more intractable due to massive data involved and the combinatorial explosion problem. In this thesis, a comprehensive study is conducted to deal with the security threats particularly from N-k contingency induced topological changes in transmission network and cascading risk in the post-contingency phase. The need of effective and efficient analytical approaches is highlighted in Chapter 1, where research background and incentive of this study are introduced in details. Chapter 2 presents an overview of existing research works concerning security issues of modern electric power network in a static sense, where tricky challenges and open problems are also identified. Motivated by previous works, a topology oriented security study is presented in Chapters 3 and 4, which cover two partsunderlying network robustness and resilience analysis, and N-k induced cascading contingency screening. Chapter 3 focuses on structural issues including topological vulnerability analysis, identification of network separations, network partitions in the smart grid environment, and percolation phenomena as critical phase transitions in power transmission network. Other than event based analysis, Chapter 3 provides high level statistical solutions based on complex network theory. In Chapter 4, a new and efficient N-k contingency screening framework is proposed, which comprises cascading failure simulation module (CFSM) for post-contingency analysis, risk evaluation module (REM) based on data mining techniques, and <b>contingency</b> screening <b>module</b> (CSM) for listing out different Pareto optimal fronts containing high-risk multiple contingencies. This framework comprehensively combines topological aspects and detailed steady-state cascading simulations. The effectiveness of this framework is demonstrated through two case studies on New England 39 -bus system and IEEE 118 -bus system. It is concluded in Chapter 5 that incorporating topological analysis of underlying networks into steady-state power system security evaluation is an effective and promising way of N-k induced cascading contingency screening. Experimental results demonstrate a high potential of this framework for practical application on system planning. Meanwhile, Chapter 5 also indicates the future works to further extend this framework to fulfill emerging requirements in future smart grids. Department of Electrical EngineeringPh.
