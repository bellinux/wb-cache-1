5000|$|Members of {{the family}} that sold the land for church use in 1912 {{attempted}} to block the sale to CVS {{on the basis of}} a restrictive <b>covenant</b> <b>in</b> the <b>deed</b> that required the property to be used as a [...] "place of divine worship." ...|$|R
50|$|While the <b>covenants</b> <b>in</b> the <b>deeds</b> constituting the {{community}} at Beach O' Pines were held to be ineffective, others created before the amendment (as long as they complied with Tulk v Moxhay) were still considered to be valid, as the Ontario Court of Appeal stated {{that they did not}} offend public policy.|$|R
50|$|Truesdell placed {{restrictive}} <b>covenants</b> <b>in</b> the <b>deeds</b> of Eckington’s residential properties {{which required}} that each house {{cost at least}} $2,000 and be set back 15 ft from the building line. There was to be no manufacturing, “nor shall spirituous liquors be sold therein.” The Union Army veteran did not place racial restrictions <b>in</b> the <b>deeds,</b> although as late as 1930 there were no African American families living in Eckington.|$|R
5000|$|Residential {{segregation}} took various forms. Some state constitutions (for example, that of California) had clauses giving local jurisdictions {{the right}} to regulate where members of certain [...] "races" [...] could live. Restrictive <b>covenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>deeds</b> had prevented minorities from purchasing properties from any subsequent owner. In the 1948 case of Shelley v. Kraemer, the US Supreme Court ruled that such <b>covenants</b> were unenforceable <b>in</b> a court of law. Residential segregation patterns had already become established in most American cities, but they have taken new forms in areas of increased immigration. New immigrant populations have typically moved into older areas to become established, a pattern of population succession seen in many areas. It appears that many ethnic populations prefer to live in areas of concentration, with their own foods, stores, religious institutions and other familiar services. People from a village or region often resettle close together in new areas, even as they move into suburban areas.|$|R
50|$|After {{the seminary}} was built, Moore began the {{residential}} development of his Chelsea {{estate in the}} 1820s {{with the help of}} James N. Wells, dividing it into lots along Ninth Avenue and selling them to well-heeled New Yorkers. <b>Covenants</b> <b>in</b> the <b>deeds</b> of sale created a planned neighborhood, specifying what could be built on the land as well as architectural details of the buildings. Stables, manufacturing and commercial uses were forbidden in the development.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1970s, Elinor and Bessie campaigned to {{preserve}} open grassland on Asket Hill, {{part of the}} family's Beechwood Estate. They placed a legally binding [...] "non-build" [...] <b>covenant</b> <b>in</b> the ownership <b>deeds.</b> After Elinor's death, Leeds Girls' High School acquired a Grade II listed building and named it after her.|$|R
50|$|In 1917, in {{the case}} of Buchanan v. Warley (1917), the Supreme Court of the United States voided the racial {{residency}} statutes that were forbidding blacks from living in white neighborhoods. The court ruled that the statutes were violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In turn, whites used racially restrictive <b>covenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>deeds,</b> and real estate businesses informally applied them to prevent the selling of houses to black Americans in white neighborhoods. To thwart the Supreme Court’s Buchanan v. Warley prohibition of such legal business racism, state courts interpreted the covenants as a contract between private persons, outside the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, in the Shelley v. Kraemer (1948) case, the Supreme Court ruled that the Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause outlawed the states’ legal enforcement of racially restrictive <b>covenants</b> <b>in</b> state courts. In this event, decades of segregation practices were annulled, which had compelled black Americans to live in over-crowded and over-priced ghettos. Freed by the Supreme Court from the legal restrictions, it became possible to sell white housing to blacks. Real estate companies started selling houses to those who could buy, if they could find a willing white seller.|$|R
25|$|In the 1930s, states {{outside the}} South (where racial {{segregation}} was legal) practiced unofficial segregation via exclusionary <b>covenants</b> <b>in</b> title <b>deeds</b> {{and real estate}} neighborhood redlining– explicit, legally sanctioned racial discrimination in real property ownership and lending practices. Blacks were effectively barred from pursuing homeownership, {{even when they were}} able to afford it. Suburban expansion was reserved for middle-class and working-class white people, facilitated by their increased wages incurred by the war effort and by subsequent federally guaranteed mortgages (VA, FHA, HOLC) available only to whites to buy new houses, such as those created by the Federal Housing Administration.|$|R
50|$|The old village primary school, {{which was}} just under 100 years old, was {{controversially}} demolished in 2005, after much opposition from local residents. A <b>covenant</b> <b>in</b> the <b>deeds</b> of the land on which the old school was built, stated how the land was sold by the Mostyn Family on the condition it was only to be used solely for educational purposes. Although this point was expressed to Flintshire County Council, they proceeded with the demolition. A new school was built to replace it, but in {{a different part of}} Greenfield. Both schools were named Ysgol Maesglas (Greenfield School).|$|R
50|$|The United Kingdom, England and Wales {{operate a}} 'property register'. Title deeds are {{documents}} showing ownership, {{as well as}} rights, obligations, or mortgages on the property. Since around 2000, compulsory registration has been required for all properties mortgaged or transferred. The details of rights, obligations, and <b>covenants</b> referred to <b>in</b> <b>deeds</b> will {{be transferred to the}} register, a contract describing the property ownership.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{the land}} was owned by the Washington Grove Camp Meeting Association, it had {{complete}} control over who purchased and leased the plots. In the early 20th century, the Washington Grove Camp Association, and later the Town of Washington Grove, placed restrictive <b>covenants</b> <b>in</b> <b>deeds</b> and leases <b>in</b> order to prevent African Americans from buying, renting, or leasing land in Washington Grove. [...] This is exemplified in one of many deeds, such as one dating from 1925 that reads, [...] "That whereas the death rate of persons of African descent {{is much greater than}} the death rate of persons of the white race and affects injuriously the health of the town and village communities, and as the permanent location of persons of African descent in such places as owners or tenants constitutes and irreparable injury to the value and usefulness of real estate in the interest of public health and to prevent irreparable injury to the grantor or its successors and assigns, and the owners of adjacent real estate, the grantees, their heirs and assigns, hereby covenant, and agree with the grantor, its successors and assigns, that they will not sell, conveyor rent the premises hereby conveyed, the whole or any part thereof, or any structure thereon, to any person of African descent." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1714, {{when the}} colonial {{government}} was deciding where {{to locate the}} county seat and courthouse, Freeholder John Reid, the first Surveyor General of East Jersey, wanted the county seat located in Freehold. Reid sold the property to the Board of Chosen Freeholders at a bargain price, and {{this may have been}} the deciding factor why Freehold was selected over Middletown and Shrewsbury. In return for the heavily discounted price, Reid placed a restrictive <b>covenant</b> <b>in</b> the <b>deed</b> that, should the property ever cease being used as a courthouse, ownership would revert to the Reid family. Direct descendants of John Reid still reside in Freehold Township.|$|R
50|$|Three years later, {{during a}} {{dispute between the}} {{federation}} and the museum, run by the National Bottle Museum Society, the museum was evicted. A <b>covenant</b> <b>in</b> the <b>deed</b> by which the Verbecks donated the house provided {{that if it were}} not used as a museum, ownership would revert to the family. As a condition of the grant that restored the house, which required that the house continue {{to be used as a}} museum for at least 23 years, the covenant was lifted. The federation put the house on the market. It is now the offices of a local insurance agency. and financial management firm.|$|R

50|$|In 1827, Moore {{gave the}} land of his apple orchard to the Episcopal Diocese of New York for the General Theological Seminary, which built its brownstone Gothic, tree-shaded campus south of the manor house. Despite his {{objections}} to the Commissioner's Plan of 1811, which ran the new Ninth Avenue {{through the middle of}} his estate, Moore began the development of Chelsea with the help of James N. Wells, dividing it up into lots along Ninth Avenue and selling them to well-heeled New Yorkers. <b>Covenants</b> <b>in</b> the <b>deeds</b> of sale specified what could be built on the land - stables, manufacturing and commercial uses were forbidden - as well as architectural details of the buildings.|$|R
50|$|Thompson {{asserted}} that Newlands excluded non-whites from the neighborhood, but the Chevy Chase Historical Society reported that Newlands never included racial <b>covenants</b> <b>in</b> the land <b>deeds</b> for Chevy Chase. Such restrictions {{were not included}} <b>in</b> the early <b>deeds,</b> but some sections of Chevy Chase included race and religion restrictions by the 1930s. However, these were not created by Newlands, who died in 1917. The Historical Society conceded that while Newlands' views on race are on public record, they were widely held beliefs throughout the nation during Newlands' lifetime.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Covenants</b> <b>in</b> the <b>deeds</b> {{for each}} lot limited {{construction}} {{on it to}} one single-family house, to be sold or valued at no less than $4,000 ($ in contemporary dollars), almost twice the median home value in Schenectady at that time, a value later raised to account for inflation. Construction had to commence within {{two years of the}} purchase of the lot. The setback and lot size restrictions were also set at this time. Another provision limited the height of any fence between properties to , {{to make sure they were}} purely ornamental in purpose.

50|$|In 1937, Mescheloff {{became the}} rabbi of Beth Jacob Congregation ("the Third Street shul") in Miami Beach, Florida, after the untimely, sudden {{passing of the}} {{previous}} rabbi. Beth Jacob was the only synagogue in Miami Beach at the time. There were Restrictive <b>covenants</b> <b>in</b> the land <b>deeds</b> of one of South Florida's biggest real estate developers in the 1920s. That is why no Jews lived north of Miami Beach's Fifth Street until the 1940s, when such limitations became unenforceable and, later, illegal.|$|R

50|$|A {{bill was}} filed for foreclosure, and to compel a {{surrender}} of a copyhold estate for three lives, under a <b>covenant</b> <b>in</b> the mortgage <b>deed,</b> 2d July 1792, to surrender those premises {{as an additional}} security. Did a covenant of the mortgagor bar the right of his widow to free-bench? The custom of the manor appeared by the evidence to be, that the copyholder could convey these estates by surrender; but where he dies seised of the estate, the widow is entitled to the estate during her widowhood as her free-bench.|$|R
50|$|In certain {{residential}} areas, largely rural, {{large tracts}} of land may have no services whatever, thus residents seeking services must use a motor vehicle or other transport, so the need for transport has resulted in land development following existing or planned transport infrastructure such as rail and road. Development patterns may be regulated by restrictive <b>covenants</b> contained <b>in</b> the <b>deeds</b> to the properties in the development, and may also result from or be reinforced by zoning. Restrictive covenants are not easily changed when the agreement of all property owners (many of whom may not live in the area) is required. The area so restricted may be large or small.|$|R
5000|$|Gaylord Logan and Lewis Pratt, two Albany lawyers, using a $100,000 {{bank loan}} in 1869 {{to buy the}} area which later {{gave birth to the}} name of Pine Hills. They named the area Pine Hills for the pine forests on hilltops along Western Avenue. The hills were {{sculptured}} into terraced lawns, which can still be seen on South Allen Street, where in 1889 tax records describe a [...] "Pine Grove" [...] between 88 and 112 South Allen. The area they had purchased was from Allen Street west to Manning Boulevard and from Cortland Street north to Washington Avenue. Logan and Pratt formed the Albany Land Improvement Company and began selling 50 ft by 200 ft lots in 1881 after having laid out and paved tree-lined streets along with flagstone sidewalks, and laying water, sewer, and gas mains as well. Homes in the area were constructed by the Sano-Rubin Construction Company and the West End Building Company. These two companies also constructed many other homes throughout the city. <b>Covenants</b> <b>in</b> the <b>deeds</b> [...] "forever prevent the use of the property for businesspurposes or the sale of intoxicating liquors" [...] which predate the use of zoning in the city of Albany. Originally the lots sold for $1,200, but by 1891 reduced to $840, after the Depression of 1893 the bank foreclosed on the land and sold the lots even cheaper. Beginning in 1886, the West End Building Company constructed 200 homes, and in the early 20th century, the Sano-Rubin Construction Company constructed another 400.|$|R
2500|$|An {{easement}} may be implied or express. An {{express easement}} may be [...] "granted" [...] or [...] "reserved" [...] <b>in</b> a <b>deed</b> or other legal instrument.

50|$|Restrictive {{covenants}} were inserted by {{the developer}} <b>in</b> the <b>deeds</b> of transfer that limited ownership to the properties inside Beach O' Pines based upon ethnic origin until August 1962.
