5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E
5|$|However, {{mitochondrial}} DNA reflects {{only the}} history of the females in a population and so may not represent {{the history of}} the population as a whole. This can be partially overcome by the use of paternal genetic sequences, such as the non-recombining region of the Y-chromosome. In a broader sense, only studies that also include nuclear DNA <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> a comprehensive evolutionary history of a population.|$|E
5|$|In Environmental Ethics and Process Thinking, Palmer {{examines}} whether process philosophy, {{in particular}} the philosophies of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne, <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> an appropriate background for engaging in environmental ethics. Process thought, Clark notes, has frequently appealed more to theologically-inclined environmental ethicists than classical theism; in particular, the views of Hartshorne and Cobb have been influential.|$|E

25|$|<b>CAN</b> <b>provides</b> an {{alternative}} to the Nef reaction; for example, for ketomacrolide synthesis where complicating side reactions usually encountered using other reagents. Oxidative halogenation can be promoted by CAN as an in situ oxidant for benzylic bromination, and the iodination of ketones and uracil derivatives.|$|R
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to explain why zero is even without referring to formal definitions. The following explanations {{make sense of the}} idea that zero is even in terms of fundamental number concepts. From this foundation, one <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> a rationale for the definition itself—and its applicability to zero.|$|E
5|$|Linear probing <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> high {{performance}} {{because of its}} good locality of reference, but is {{more sensitive to the}} quality of its hash function than some other collision resolution schemes. It takes constant expected time per search, insertion, or deletion when implemented using a random hash function, a 5-independent hash function, or tabulation hashing. However, good results can be achieved in practice with other hash functions such as MurmurHash.|$|E
5|$|Mendelevium-256, the {{chemically}} {{most important}} isotope of mendelevium, decays through electron capture 90.7% {{of the time}} and alpha decay 9.9% of the time. It is most easily detected through the spontaneous fission of its electron-capture daughter fermium-256, but in the presence of other nuclides that undergo spontaneous fission, alpha decays at the characteristic energies for mendelevium-256 (7.205 and 7.139MeV) <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> more useful identification.|$|E

5|$|Since {{forces are}} {{perceived}} as pushes or pulls, this <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> an intuitive understanding for describing forces. As with other physical concepts (e.g. temperature), the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions {{that are consistent with}} direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale. Through experimentation, it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by Newtonian mechanics.|$|E
