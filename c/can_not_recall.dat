This old man sang, or rather chanted, certain words in a peculiarly long-drawn, {{guttural}} manner, throwing back his head, and turning up his sightless eyeballs to the sky. His chant was a lamentation upon his infirmity; {{and at the time}} it produced the same effect upon me, that my first reading of Milton's Invocation to the Sun did, years afterward.

6000|$|... "I {{never knew}} a mortal mother. The {{farthest}} stretch of my life's memory <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>recall</b> one single feature {{of such a}} face. If, indeed, mother of mine hath lived, she is long gone, and cast no shadow on the ground she trod. Pierre, the lips that do now speak to thee, never touched a woman's breast; I seem not of woman born. My first dim life-thoughts cluster round an old, half-ruinous house in some region, for which I now have no chart to seek it out. If such a spot did ever really exist, that too {{seems to have been}} withdrawn from all the remainder of the earth. It was a wild, dark house, planted {{in the midst of a}} round, cleared, deeply-sloping space, scooped out of the middle of deep stunted pine woods. Ever I shrunk at evening from peeping out of my window, lest the ghostly pines should steal near to me, and reach out their grim arms to snatch me into their horrid shadows. In summer the forest unceasingly hummed with unconjecturable voices of unknown birds and beasts. In winter its deep snows were traced like any paper map, with dotting night-tracks of four-footed creatures, that, even to the sun, were never visible, and never were seen by man at all. In the round open space the dark house stood, without one single green twig or leaf to shelter it; shadeless and shelterless in the heart of shade and shelter. Some of the windows were rudely boarded up, with boards nailed straight up and down; and those rooms were utterly empty, and never were entered, though they were doorless. But often, from the echoing corridor, I gazed into them with fear; for the great fire-places were all in ruins; the lower tier of back-stones were burnt into one white, common crumbling; and the black bricks above had fallen upon the hearths, heaped here and there with the still falling soot of long-extinguished fires. Every hearth-stone in that house had one long crack through it; every floor drooped at the corners; and outside, the whole base of the house, where it rested on the low foundation of greenish stones, was strewn with dull, yellow molderings of the rotting sills. No name; no scrawled or written thing; no book, was in the house; no one memorial speaking of its former occupants. It was dumb as death. No grave-stone, or mound, or any little hillock around the house, betrayed any past burials of man or child. And thus, with no trace then to me of its past history, thus it hath now entirely departed and perished from my slightest knowledge as to where that house so stood, or in what region it so stood. None other house like it have I ever seen. But once I saw plates of the outside of French chateaux which powerfully recalled its dim image to me, especially the two rows of small dormer windows projecting from the inverted hopper-roof. But that house was of wood, and these of stone. Still, sometimes I think that house was not in this country, but somewhere in Europe; perhaps in France; but it is all bewildering to me; and so you must not start at me, for I can not but talk wildly upon so wild a theme.|$|E

We also use the model to address the stochastic relationship between recall and familiarity (i. e., are they independent), and the effects of partial vs. complete hippocampa...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{interest}} in a lifecourse perspective on health inequalities will rekindle concerns about the accuracy of retrospective data. The present paper demonstrates that recalled information on some types of social circumstances can be obtained with a useful degree of accuracy using an interview technique which helps to minimize recall bias. Lifegrid information about social circumstances during their youth and childhood was collected from 57 subjects in early old age and compared with archive material of the same subjects' social circumstances recorded 50 years previously. A comparison of interview with archive data revealed that a substantial majority of subjects had recalled simple sociodemographic information {{after a period of}} 50 years with a useful degree of accuracy. Within lifecourse research, it is concluded, carefully collected retrospective data offer a valuable complement to birth cohort studies, provided that such usage is sensitive to the types of items of information which <b>can,</b> and <b>can</b> <b>not,</b> be <b>recalled</b> accurately. lifecourse health inequalities retrospective data lifegrid...|$|R

The onset of RMD is typically in early childhood, rarely continue into adolescence and adulthood. This paper retrospectively analyzed the diagnosis and treatment {{in a case of}} adult-onset RMD. A 76 -year-old male mainly presented rhythmic forehead banging during sleep. The number of forehead banging ranged from dozens to tens of seconds, pause seconds after the second attack, lasting 1 to 2 h and <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be <b>recalled</b> after waking up. Polysomnography (PSG) showed sleep efficiency decreased, awakening time prolonged, times of wakefulness increased, sleep structure disordered, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) 1 and 2 sleep increased, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep decreased, sleep latency of REM prolonged. Apnea hypopnea index (AHI) was 8. 40. Several abnormal behavior attacks were observed, each attack lasting 3 to 18 s, 0. 60 to 1. 20 Hz, total time lasting 6 min. The diagnosis was RMD, clonazepam 0. 50 mg/night and pramipexole 0. 0625 mg/night were given and the result of 33 months follow-up showed effective. By literature review, we know the clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of RMD. We also analyze the reasons of misdiagnosis for reducing diagnostic errors and mistreatments.

This research was a qualitative descriptive research and the subjects were grade XI students of Banyumas State Senior High School in academic year 2014 / 2015. The subjects were selected based on specific criteria by using snowball sampling technique. Data was collected by using interview based on problem solving tasks {{and validity of the}} data was done by using time triangulation. Data validity was used to determine the metacognition process in mathematical problem solving from each research subject in each component metacognition process. The components were arranging the strategy or action plan, controlling or monitoring the actions, and evaluating the action. Results showed that students with high, medium, and low academic ability realized their thinking process by identifying the information of the problem when arranged the action plan. However, there are students with low academic ability <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>recall</b> their prior knowledge previously required. They also can not make the plan solutions are used.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} two explanations for the non-occurrence of false memories in the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm. One explanation was that a critical lure is <b>not</b> <b>recalled</b> because the list failed to evoke it in the participant's mind. Another possible explanation was that the participant would identify the critical lure and would remember, at the time of recall, that the lure was not produced by an external source. In order to explore these two possible explanations for the non-occurrence of false memories, an experimental phase was added to the usual DRM paradigm: participants were asked to recall items they thought of but did <b>not</b> <b>recall</b> because these items were not members of the list presented by the experimenter.
