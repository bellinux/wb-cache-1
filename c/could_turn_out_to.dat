25|$|Despite {{the age of}} the colony, castes {{are almost}} always indistinguishable. Caste {{totipotency}} exists where all individual wasps are totipotent. Totipotency is the ability of a single cell to produce all of the differentiated cells in an organism. Therefore, one young wasp <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be a queen or a worker. So, caste determination is dictated post-imaginally (pre-adult determination). In Parachartergus fraternus, the reproductive females resemble non reproductive females: there are not many physical differences. Based on morphology alone it is difficult to distinguish between castes. There is evidence for caste flexibility in Parachartergus fraternus. Intermediates may be potential queens but also perform some worker activities early on in their lives.|$|E
25|$|Popper {{regarded}} {{theories that}} have survived criticism as better corroborated {{in proportion to}} the amount and stringency of the criticism, but, {{in sharp contrast to the}} inductivist theories of knowledge, emphatically as less likely to be true. Popper held that seeking for theories with a high probability of being true was a false goal that is in conflict with the search for knowledge. Science should seek for theories that are most probably false on the one hand (which is the same as saying that they are highly falsifiable and so there are lots of ways that they <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be wrong), but still all actual attempts to falsify them have failed so far (that they are highly corroborated).|$|E
25|$|Gutworms {{and similar}} parasites {{are present in}} {{untreated}} drinking water in developing countries, and {{were present in the}} water of developed countries until the routine chlorination and purification of drinking water supplies. Recent research has shown that some common parasites, such as intestinal worms (e.g., hookworms), secrete chemicals into the gut wall (and, hence, the bloodstream) that suppress the immune system and prevent the body from attacking the parasite. This gives rise to a new slant on the hygiene hypothesis theory—that co-evolution of humans and parasites has led to an immune system that functions correctly only {{in the presence of the}} parasites. Without them, the immune system becomes unbalanced and oversensitive. In particular, research suggests that allergies may coincide with the delayed establishment of gut flora in infants. However, the research to support this theory is conflicting, with some studies performed in China and Ethiopia showing an increase in allergy in people infected with intestinal worms. Clinical trials have been initiated to test the effectiveness of certain worms in treating some allergies. It may be that the term 'parasite' <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be inappropriate, and in fact a hitherto unsuspected symbiosis is at work.

25|$|During the operation, {{the lymph}} nodes in the axilla are also {{considered}} for removal. In the past, large axillary operations took out 10 to 40 nodes to establish whether cancer had spread. This had the unfortunate side effect of frequently causing lymphedema of the arm on the same side, as the removal of this many lymph nodes affected lymphatic drainage. More recently, the technique of sentinel lymph node (SLN) dissection has become popular, as it requires the removal of far fewer lymph nodes, resulting in fewer side effects while achieving the same 10-year survival as its predecessor. The sentinel lymph node is the first node that drains the tumor, and subsequent SLN mapping can save 65-70% of patients with breast cancer from having a complete lymph node dissection for what <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be a negative nodal basin. Advances in Sentinel Lymph Node mapping {{over the past decade}} have increased the accuracy of detecting Sentinel Lymph Node from 80% using blue dye alone to between 92% and 98% using combined modalities. SLN biopsy is indicated for patients with T1 and T2 lesions (<5nbsp&cm) and carries a number of recommendations for use on patient subgroups. Recent trends continue to favor less radical axillar node resection even in the presence of some metastases in the sentinel node.|$|E

The free-riding motives and the difficulty of reaching an effective international environmental agreement are reviewed.

This is complemented by a review of the possibility of green paradox outcomes in dynamic open-economy models with an exhaustible resource exploited by far-sighted firms. It is shown that border tax adjustments can lead to a green paradox outcome. Directions for future research are suggested...|$|R
