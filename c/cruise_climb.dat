50|$|The takeoff {{attitude}} {{is similar to}} and for some aircraft, identical to a <b>cruise</b> <b>climb</b> attitude.|$|E
50|$|Where {{traffic is}} not an issue, cruise climbs may still be used. Concorde, for example, used a {{continuous}} <b>cruise</b> <b>climb</b> throughout its flights, since there was normally never any other traffic at the same altitude (nearly 60,000 feet) in the same direction.|$|E
50|$|Originally, {{a simple}} <b>cruise</b> <b>climb</b> {{was used by}} pilots. This {{amounted}} to a simple, continuous, very gradual climb from an initial cruise altitude to a final cruise altitude, and made the most efficient use of fuel. However, with increasing air traffic and the assignment of distinct flight levels to specific flights, airways, and directions of flight, {{it is no longer}} safe to climb continuously in this way, and so most flights compromise by climbing in distinct steps - a step climb - with ATC approval, {{in order to ensure that}} the aircraft is always at an appropriate altitude for traffic control. While not quite as efficient as a continuous <b>cruise</b> <b>climb,</b> step climbs are still more efficient than maintaining a single altitude throughout a flight. The step climb intervals may be 1000, 2000, or 4000 feet, depending on the flight level rules which apply on the particular airway being flown.|$|E
50|$|As an {{aircraft}} burns fuel it gets lighter and can cruise higher {{where it is}} generally more efficient. Step <b>climbs</b> or <b>cruise</b> <b>climbs</b> facilitate this. VNAV can determine where the step or <b>cruise</b> <b>climbs</b> (where the aircraft drifts up) should occur to minimize fuel consumption.|$|R
50|$|Step and <b>cruise</b> <b>climbs</b> are not {{normally}} applicable to lower-flying aircraft propelled by conventional piston engines with propellers or turboprops, since their performance characteristics {{may be very}} different from those of turbofan or jet engined aircraft. In fact, the most efficient altitude for a small general aviation aircraft may be only a few thousand feet above the ground, and increasing altitude may diminish efficiency rather than improve it (propellers tend to lose efficiency in thinner air, and many small general aviation aircraft lack supercharging, effectively decreasing the engines compression ratio, and therefore efficiency, as the aircraft climbs into more rarified atmosphere).|$|R
50|$|Aircraft Performance has various {{missions}} such as Takeoff, <b>Climb,</b> <b>Cruise,</b> Acceleration, Deceleration, Descent, Landing {{and other}} Basic fighter maneuvers etc..|$|R
50|$|To {{provide an}} optimum entry date into service, Lockheed {{decided to use}} a beefed-up {{turbofan}} derivative of the Pratt & Whitney J58. The J58 had already successfully proven itself as a high-thrust, high-performance jet engine on the top-secret Lockheed A-12 (and subsequently on the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.) Since it was a turbofan, it was deemed to be quieter than a typical turbojet at low altitude and low speed, required no afterburner for takeoff, and allowed reduced power settings. The engines were placed in cylindrical pods with a wedge-shaped splitter, and a squarish intake providing the inlet system for the aircraft. The inlet was designed {{with the goal of}} requiring no moving parts, and was naturally stable. To reduce the noise from sonic booms, rather than penetrate the sound barrier at a more ideal 30,000 ft (9,144 m), they intended to penetrate it at 42,000 ft (12,802 m) instead. It would not be possible on hot days, but on normal days this would be achievable. Acceleration would continue through the sound barrier to Mach 1.15, at which point sonic booms would be audible on the ground. The plane would climb precisely to minimize sonic boom levels. After an initial level-off at around 71,500 ft (21,793 m), the plane would <b>cruise</b> <b>climb</b> upwards, ultimately reaching 76,500 ft (23,317 m). Descents would also be performed in a precise way to reduce sonic boom levels until subsonic speeds were reached.|$|E
40|$|The Breguet range {{equation}} {{was developed}} for <b>cruise</b> <b>climb</b> flight of a jet aircraft to include the climb angle and is then maximized {{with respect to the}} no wind true airspeed.

40|$|Tests {{were made}} in the Ames 40 by 80 ft Wind Tunnel of a semispan wing with a nacelle (no propeller) from a typical, general {{aviation}} twin-engine aircraft. Measurements were made of the effect on drag of the flow of cooling air through the nacelle. Internal and external nacelle pressures were measured. It was found that the cooling airflow accounts for about 13 % of the total estimated airplane drag during both <b>cruise</b> and <b>climb.</b> The now of cooling air through the nacelle accounts for 30 % of the airflow drag component during cruise and 42 % during climb; the balance, in both <b>cruise</b> and <b>climb,</b> is attributed to [he external shape of the nacelle. It was suggested that improvements could possibly be made by relocating both the inlet and the outlet for the cooling air...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} coupled aerostructural {{optimization}} procedure {{for the design of}} a fuel-efficient regional aircraft configuration. A detailed mission analysis is performed on an optimized flight mission profile to accurately compute the mission range, fuel burn, and flight time. The mis-sion analysis procedure is designed to allow flexible mission profiles including those with a variety of <b>cruise,</b> <b>climb</b> and descent segments in the profile. The direct operating cost (DOC) is computed based on the mission characteristics (fuel weight, range, and time), and is then used as the objective func-tion in the optimization problem. We use a coupled aerostructural solver comprised of a high-fidelity structural solver and medium-fidelity aerodynamic solver to solve for the static aeroelastic shape of the lifting surfaces. Due to the large computational cost associated with these solvers, “kriging with a trend ” surrogate models are employed to approximate the aerodynamic force and moment coef-ficients required in the mission analysis. This approach is demonstrated in two DOC minimization cases: a mission profile optimization with a fixed geometry, and an aerostructural optimization with fixed, previously optimized mission profiles for a 100 -passenger regional jet aircraft.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a first-order analysis of blind conflicts expected {{to affect the}} NAS system {{in the near future}} under two Free Flight operational concepts: RVSM and <b>Cruise</b> <b>Climb.</b> The study focused on the development and use of two computer models (AOM and AEM) to respectively predict traffic flows across well defined volumes of airspace, and the number of potential blind conflicts if all flight plans are executed without controller or pilot intervention. The models developed have been coded in Matlab, a general engineering language, facilitating their execution on any computer platform (PCs, PowerPC Macs, and UNIX workstations) without modifications. While this study provides a first-order approximation of the level of conflict exposure in a particular center or sector it does not provide a measure of collision risk in the true sense. Further investigation of the end-game ATC controller and pilot dynamics (including aircraft navigational accuracy) is need-ed to truly quantify collision risk. Some insightful computational test are conducted to understand traffic pattern variations and blind con-flicts in four enroute control centers in CONUS. The time and spatial characteristics of these conflicts were studied using the tools developed to provide a view into the type of conflict encounters expected in future NAS operations. The hope is that these tools would be further refined to assess collision ris...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the potential fuel burn benefits of altitude and speed optimization in the cruise phase of flight for domestic airlines in the United States. Airlines can achieve cost reductions and reduce environmental impact by making small {{modifications to the}} cruise phase operating condition. The efficiency of the National Airspace System can be improved with coordination between air traffic controllers, pilots, and airline dispatchers. This study builds off of prior {{work in this area}} to establish best-case benefits assuming full implementation of fuel-optimal cruise altitudes and speeds. In order to achieve these objectives, a cruise-phase fuel burn estimator was developed using publicly-available radar tracks and weather data. This estimator was used to examine 217, 000 flights from 2012. Maximum benefits from altitude optimization (holding speed constant) were found to be on the order 1. 96 %. The majority of potential altitude benefits can be achieved using step climb optimization, with only marginal gain from <b>cruise</b> <b>climb</b> implementation. The maximum benefits for speed optimization (holding altitude constant) were found to be 1. 94 % with an average flight time increase of 3. 5 minutes per flight. Simultaneous altitude and speed optimization yielded a potential cruise fuel burn reduction of 3. 71 %. In practice, operational considerations and barriers to implementation limit likely system fuel reduction to lower levels. High-benefit operations within the NAS are identified and potential implementation considerations are discussed.

40|$|Extract] Dear Editor, The {{majority}} {{of research in}} travel health and medicine is clinical or medical. However, health {{is more than just}} medicine, and health research more than just medical research. Vast areas in travel health remain un-researched due to 1) a reluctance by researchers to join travellers at their destinations and 2) the specialty's unfamiliarity {{with a wide range of}} established and validated research methods, the application of which would fill considerable gaps in its current body of knowledge. Ten out of 70 original articles (15 %) published in the Journal of Travel Medicine in 2013 / 2014 studied travellers (though not necessarily tourists) on location. Within the same timeframe, five out of 76 original research papers (6 %) published in Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease collected data on location; none on tourists. With these few exceptions, travellers are studied in medical settings either in person (as prospective travellers or patients post-travel) or via their medical records. However, the greater part of travellers will not come near a health facility, and a large number of people, who could contribute to exploring important travel health topics, are lost to science. Therefore, researchers also need to study travellers where they are (on travels) not just before or after a trip. Joining the travelling public independently or through commercially organised trips (<b>cruises,</b> <b>climbing</b> holidays or other organised activities) not only gives access to the study population but lets the researcher experience the context in which the researched topic takes place...|$|R
