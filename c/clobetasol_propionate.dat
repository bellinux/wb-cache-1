50|$|Lichen sclerosus {{is another}} {{common cause of}} vulvitis in children, and it often affects an {{hourglass}} or figure eight-shaped area of skin around the anus and vulva. Symptoms of a mild case include skin fissures, loss of skin pigment (hypopigmentation), skin atrophy, a parchment-like texture to the skin, dysuria, itching, discomfort, and excoriation. In more severe cases, the vulva may become discolored, developing dark purple bruising (ecchymosis), bleeding, scarring, attenuation of the labia minora, and fissures and bleeding affecting the posterior fourchette. Its cause is unknown, but likely genetic or autoimmune, and it is unconnected to malignancy in children. If the skin changes are not obvious on visual inspection, a biopsy of the skin may be performed to acquire an exact diagnosis. Treatment for vulvar lichen sclerosis may consist of topical hydrocortisone in mild cases, or stronger topical steroids (e.g. <b>clobetasol</b> <b>propionate).</b> Preliminary studies show that 75% of cases do not resolve with puberty.|$|E
5000|$|... 11α-Hydroxyprogesterone (11α-OHP), or 11α-hydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione is an {{endogenous}} steroid and metabolite of progesterone. It is a weak antiandrogen, and is {{devoid of}} androgenic, estrogenic, and progestogenic activity. It was investigated as a topical antiandrogen {{for the treatment}} of androgen-dependent skin conditions in the early 1950s, and was found to produce some benefit. In 1995, 11α-OHP, along with its epimer 11β-hydroxyprogesterone, was identified as a very potent competitive inhibitor of both isoforms (1 and 2) of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD). It is notably not metabolized by 11β-HSD2. 11α-OHP is a more potent inhibitor of 11β-HSD than enoxolone (glycyrrhetinic acid) or carbenoxolone in vitro (IC50 = 0.9 nM; IC50 = 5 nM in transfected cells). The compound {{has been found to be}} highly active in conferring mineralocorticoid sodium-retaining activity of corticosterone in vivo in rat bioassays and in increasing blood pressure, effects that it mediates by preventing the 11β-HSD-mediated inactivation of endogenous corticosteroids. Because of its inhibition of 11β-HSD and consequent potentiation of corticosteroids, 11α-OHP has recently been patented {{for the treatment of}} skin diseases, particularly psoriasis in combination with <b>clobetasol</b> <b>propionate</b> and minoxidil.|$|E

The adopted thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) -densitometric procedure could effectively separate <b>clobetasol</b> <b>propionate</b> from its related compound, namely clobetasol. It is linear for <b>clobetasol</b> <b>propionate</b> {{in the range of}} 0. 188 ÷ 5 µg/spot.

METHODS:Fifty-four patients (34 males and 20 females) {{with a history of}} vesiculo-ulcero-erosive oral lesions were selected: 24 with oral erosive lichen planus and 30 with aphthae. The subjects enrolled were randomly divided into three groups, each of 18 patients (10 with aphthae and 8 with lichen planus) : the first was treated with topical <b>clobetasol</b> <b>propionate</b> ointment (0. 05 %) directly on the lesion(s) three times a day; the second with <b>clobetasol</b> <b>propionate</b> in an adhesive denture paste in equal amounts (1 : 1) two times a day; the third with <b>clobetasol</b> <b>propionate</b> in an oral analgesic base (Orabase-B) in equal amounts (1 : 1) two times a day. Each subject scored his or her symptoms daily from most severe (7) to none (0) by verbal assessments using a categorical scale. RESULTS:In all cases, the administration of the corticosteroid was effective in producing remission of symptoms in each group of patients. Significant differences (P< 0. 05) between groups were determined by the Kruskal-Wallis test. The Dunn test was used in order to detect which group differs from the others; clobetasol and adhesive denture paste correlated with an early remission of pain in lichen and apthous lesions.

40|$|Purpose. The {{validity}} of using drug amount-depth profiles in stratum corneum to predict uptake of <b>clobetasol</b> <b>propionate</b> into stratum corneum and its transport into deeper skin layers was investigated. Methods. In vitro diffusion experiments through human epidermis {{were carried out}} using Franz-type glass diffusion cells. A saturated solution of <b>clobetasol</b> <b>propionate</b> in 20 % (V/V) aqueous propylene glycol was topically applied for 48 h. Steady state flux was calculated from the cumulative amount of drug permeated vs. time profile. Epidermal partitioning was conducted by applying a saturated drug solution to {{both sides of the}} epidermis and allowing time to equilibrate. The tape stripping technique was used to define drug concentration-depth profiles in stratum corneum for both the diffusion and equilibrium experiments. Results. The concentration-depth profile of <b>clobetasol</b> <b>propionate</b> in stratum corneum for the diffusion experiment is biphasic. A logarithmic decline of the drug concentration over the first four to five tape strips flattens to a relatively constant low concentration level in deeper layers. The drug concentration-depth profile for the equilibrium studies displays a similar shape. Conclusions. The shape of the concentration-depth profile of <b>clobetasol</b> <b>propionate</b> is mainly because of the variable partitioning coefficient in different stratum corneum layers. No Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|Background : Palmoplantar {{psoriasis}} is a frequently encountered {{variant of}} psoriasis. It {{is difficult to}} treat and {{even more difficult to}} maintain remission as it is exacerbated by friction and trauma of the patient&#x 2032;s daily activities. Existing topical modalities of treatment are often inadequate and show unpredictable response. Aim : To study the efficacy and safety of a newer retinoid, tazarotene, as 0. 1 &#x 0025; cream in the treatment of palmoplantar psoriasis. Materials and Methods : Thirty adult patients with palmo-plantar psoriasis were randomized to therapy with once daily application of topical tazarotene cream (0. 1 &#x 0025;) or once daily application of <b>clobetasol</b> <b>propionate</b> cream (0. 05 &#x 0025;) for 12 weeks. The patients were assessed every 2 weeks for improvement in Erythema, Scaling, Fissures and Induration (ESFI) score and Physicians Global Assessment Scale. Results : At 12 weeks, the tazarotene group showed mean ESFI reduction to 1. 12 (83. 2 &#x 0025;) from 6. 65 at baseline. Complete clearance was noted in 52. 9 &#x 0025; of the patients. <b>Clobetasol</b> <b>propionate</b> group showed mean ESFI reduction to 0. 62 (89. 1 &#x 0025;) from 5. 69 at baseline, with complete clearance in 61. 5 &#x 0025; of the patients.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to re-visit the tape stripping technique, incorporate refinements to reduce variability and validate the method using bioequivalence data obtained from the assessment of a topical corticosteroid cream containing 0. 05 % <b>clobetasol</b> <b>propionate</b> using the human skin blanching assay. Methods: A pilot tape stripping study was conducted to establish the variability of the formulations. The bioequivalence of two different commercially available <b>clobetasol</b> <b>propionate</b> cream formulations and a <b>clobetasol</b> <b>propionate</b> ointment formulation were subsequently investigated using the tape stripping method. Results: The data from the pilot tape stripping study correlated well with data from the human skin blanching assay. A subsequent pivotal tape stripping study confirmed bioequivalence between the two cream formulations whereas bio-inequivalence was demonstrated between the cream and ointment formulations. Conclusions: These studies show that the results from tape stripping concur with data from the human skin blanching assay and demonstrate the potential of a well-controlled tape stripping study as an option for the assessment of bioequivalence of topical corticosteroid formulations...|$|E
