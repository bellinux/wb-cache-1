25|$|Cracking of the {{concrete}} section {{is nearly impossible to}} prevent; however, the size and location of cracks can be limited and controlled by appropriate reinforcement, control joints, curing methodology and <b>concrete</b> <b>mix</b> design. Cracking can allow moisture to penetrate and corrode the reinforcement. This is a serviceability failure in limit state design. Cracking is normally the result of an inadequate quantity of rebar, or rebar spaced at too great a distance. The concrete then cracks either under excess loading, or due to internal effects such as early thermal shrinkage while it cures.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study on the durability properties of self compacting, high-volume fly ash <b>concrete</b> <b>mixes</b> (SCC-HVFC) <b>mixes.</b> Five self-compacting <b>concrete</b> <b>mixes</b> with a higher cement replacement at 60 % of cement with fly-ash, are designed and their performance is compared with two normally-vibrated <b>concrete</b> <b>mixes</b> (NCs) of equivalent M 30 strength grade. The durability properties are evaluated in terms of chloride-ion penetrability as measured by RCPT tests. The results indicate that the SCC-HVFC mixes would have lesser permeable voids than the normally-vibrated <b>concrete</b> <b>mixes</b> of comparable strengths. The experimental results also show that large improvements against chloride penetration can be realized with self- compacting high-volume fly-ash <b>concrete</b> <b>mixes</b> additionally admixed with GGBFS, silics fume, metakaolin and rice husk ash.

25|$|Concrete {{surfaces}} (specifically, Portland cement concrete) {{are created}} using a <b>concrete</b> <b>mix</b> of Portland cement, coarse aggregate, sand and water. In virtually all modern mixes {{there will also}} be various admixtures added to increase workability, reduce the required amount of water, mitigate harmful chemical reactions and for other beneficial purposes. In many cases {{there will also be}} Portland cement substitutes added, such as fly ash. This can reduce the cost of the concrete and improve its physical properties. The material is applied in a freshly mixed slurry, and worked mechanically to compact the interior and force some of the cement slurry to the surface to produce a smoother, denser surface free from honeycombing. The water allows the mix to combine molecularly in a chemical reaction called hydration.|$|E
25|$|In wet {{and cold}} climates, {{reinforced}} concrete for roads, bridges, parking structures and other structures {{that may be}} exposed to deicing salt may benefit from use of corrosion-resistant reinforcement such as uncoated, low carbon/chromium (micro composite), epoxy-coated, hot dip galvanised or stainless steel rebar. Good design and a well-chosen <b>concrete</b> <b>mix</b> will provide additional protection for many applications. Uncoated, low carbon/chromium rebar looks similar to standard carbon steel rebar due to its lack of a coating; its highly corrosion-resistant features are inherent in the steel microstructure. It can be identified by the unique ASTM specified mill marking on its smooth, dark charcoal finish. Epoxy coated rebar can easily be identified by the light green colour of its epoxy coating. Hot dip galvanized rebar may be bright or dull grey depending on length of exposure, and stainless rebar exhibits a typical white metallic sheen that is readily distinguishable from carbon steel reinforcing bar.

Eleven <b>concrete</b> <b>mixes</b> were prepared: One as a control mix, seven with Gum Arabic liquid, and three with Gum Arabic liquid with modified water cement ratios added.

2500|$|Due to cement's {{exothermic}} {{chemical reaction}} while setting up, large concrete {{structures such as}} dams, navigation locks, large mat foundations, and large breakwaters generate excessive heat during hydration and associated expansion. To mitigate these effects post-cooling is commonly applied during construction. An early example at Hoover Dam, installed a network of pipes between vertical concrete placements to circulate cooling water during the curing process to avoid damaging overheating. [...] Similar systems are still used; depending on volume of the pour, the <b>concrete</b> <b>mix</b> used, and ambient air temperature, the cooling process may last for many months after the concrete is placed. Various methods also are used to pre-cool the <b>concrete</b> <b>mix</b> in mass concrete structures.|$|E

Using 0. 85 % of Melment per 100 Kg of binder enhance the concrete resistance to Impact. Using 0. 5 Liter of Glenium per 100 Kg of cement shows good performance of concrete to Impact. Using three layers of Polystyrene sheets with 0. 85 % of Melment gives high compressive strength and improve the Impact capacity of concrete.

2500|$|The {{wall panels}} are molded first using a special {{reinforced}} <b>concrete</b> <b>mix.</b> In {{addition to the}} usual cement powder, stone, etc., additional materials such as metal shavings or abrasive materials may be added to resist drilling penetration of the slab. Unlike regular concrete used in construction, the concrete for bank vaults is so thick that it cannot be poured. The consistency of concrete is measured by its [...] "slump". Vault concrete has zero slump. It also sets very quickly, curing in only six to 12 hours, instead of the three to four days needed for most concrete.|$|E
2500|$|Workability is {{the ability}} of a fresh (plastic) <b>concrete</b> <b>mix</b> to fill the form/mold {{properly}} with the desired work (vibration) and without reducing the concrete's quality. Workability depends on water content, aggregate (shape and size distribution), cementitious content and age (level of hydration) and can be modified by adding chemical admixtures, like superplasticizer. Raising the water content or adding chemical admixtures increases concrete workability. Excessive water leads to increased bleeding or segregation of aggregates (when the cement and aggregates start to separate), with the resulting concrete having reduced quality. The use of an aggregate blend with an undesirable gradation can result in a very harsh mix design with a very low slump, which cannot readily be made more workable by addition of reasonable amounts of water. An undesirable gradation can mean using a large aggregate that is too large for the size of the formwork, or which has too few smaller aggregate grades to serve to fill the gaps between the larger grades, or using too little or too much sand for the same reason, or using too little water, or too much cement, or even using jagged crushed stone instead of smoother round aggregate such as pebbles. [...] Any combination of these factors and others may result in a mix which is too harsh, i.e., which does not flow or spread out smoothly, is difficult to get into the formwork, and which is difficult to surface finish.|$|E
