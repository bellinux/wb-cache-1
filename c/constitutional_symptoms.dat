5|$|Diagnosing active {{tuberculosis}} {{based only on}} signs and symptoms is difficult, as is diagnosing the disease in those who are immunosuppressed. A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or <b>constitutional</b> <b>symptoms</b> lasting longer than two weeks. A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation. Interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in the developing world. Interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) have similar limitations in those with HIV.|$|E

25|$|The bite is {{immediately}} followed by local pain of a burning character; the limb soon swells and becomes discoloured, and within {{one to three}} hours great prostration, accompanied by vomiting, and often diarrhoea, sets in. Cold, clammy perspiration is usual. The pulse becomes extremely feeble, and slight dyspnoea and restlessness may be seen. In severe cases, which occur mostly in children, the pulse may become imperceptible and the extremities cold; the patient may pass into coma. In from twelve to twenty-four hours these severe <b>constitutional</b> <b>symptoms</b> usually pass off; {{but in the meantime}} the swelling and discoloration have spread enormously. The limb becomes phlegmonous, and occasionally suppurates. Within a few days recovery usually occurs somewhat suddenly, but death may result from the severe depression or from the secondary effects of suppuration. That cases of death, in adults as well as in children, are not infrequent {{in some parts of the}} Continent is mentioned in the last chapter of this Introduction.|$|E

40|$|We {{retrospectively}} studied 132 {{patients with}} dermatomyositis; 84 had idiopathic, 30 paraneoplastic, 5 juvenile and 13 amyopathic {{forms of the}} disease. The commonest features were macular erythema, heliotropic erythema and Gottron's papules. Flagellate erythema occurred in 5 % of patients with idiopathic dermatomyositis and correlated with the disease activity. Necrotic lesions were also found in this group of patients but did not always signal malignancy. The prevalence of malignancy was high (23 %). Raynaud's phenomenon occurred in 10. 6 % of patients, also in those with malignancy. Dysphagia, interstitial lung disease and arthralgias affected 20 %, 8 % and 40 % of patients, respectively. Anti-Jo- 1 antibodies were found in 5 % of patients with idiopathic dermatomyositis and low titre ANA in 1 / 3 of patients. ANA did not correlate with the disease activity. We confirmed {{the data from the}} literature, but no cutaneous sign, <b>constitutional</b> <b>symptom</b> or circulating antibody was found marking a particular subtype of the disease...|$|R

2500|$|Acute {{cases of}} {{hepatitis}} {{are seen to}} be resolved well within a six-month period. When hepatitis is continued {{for more than six}} months it is termed chronic hepatitis. Chronic hepatitis is often asymptomatic early in its course and is detected only by liver laboratory studies for screening purposes or to evaluate non-specific symptoms. As the inflammation progresses, patients can develop <b>constitutional</b> <b>symptoms</b> similar to acute hepatitis, including fatigue, nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, and joint pain. Jaundice can occur as well, but much later in the disease process and is typically a sign of advanced disease. Chronic hepatitis interferes with hormonal functions of the liver which can result in acne, hirsutism (abnormal hair growth), and amenorrhea (lack of menstrual period) in women. Extensive damage and scarring of the liver over time defines cirrhosis, a condition in which the liver's ability to function is permanently impeded. This results in jaundice, weight loss, coagulopathy, ascites (abdominal fluid collection), and peripheral edema (leg swelling). Cirrhosis can lead to other life-threatening complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, [...] hepatorenal syndrome, and liver cancer.|$|E

40|$|Limited {{information}} {{is available on the}} viral aetiology of influenza-like illness (ILI) in Southern European countries. Hereby we report the main findings of a survey conducted in the area of Rome during the 2004 - 2005 winter season. ILI cases were defined as individuals with fever > 37. 5 degrees C and at least one <b>constitutional</b> <b>symptom</b> and one respiratory symptom, recruited during the survey period. Influenza and other respiratory viruses were identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on throat swabs. Basic individual information was collected through a standard form. Of 173 ILI cases enrolled, 74 tested positive for one virus, and two tested positive for two viruses. Overall, 33. 5 % of the cases were positive for influenza viruses, 5. 2 % for adenoviruses, 3. 5 % for parainfluenza viruses, 1. 7 % for coronaviruses, and 1. 2 % for the respiratory syncitial virus. The proportion of influenza virus detection was higher in the 'high influenza activity' period. The distribution of viral agents varied across age groups, influenza viruses being more likely to be detected in younger patients. Viral pathogens were identified in less than 50 % of ILI cases occurred during a high activity influenza season. The detection of other than influenza viruses was sporadic, without evidence of large outbreaks due to specific agents...|$|R
40|$|Background: With the {{development}} of new antiviral agents for influenza, the urge for rapid and reliable diagnosis of influenza becomes increasingly important. Respiratory virus infections are difficult to distinguish on clinical grounds General practitioners (GPs) however still depend on their clinical judgement, Aim: To evaluate the importance of clinical symptoms in the diagnosis of influenza virus infection, Design of study: A multicentre questionnaire study. Setting: Eighty-one patients from 14 general practices. Method: Patients with fever and at least one <b>constitutional</b> <b>symptom</b> and one respiratory symptom were included. A questionnaire with the medical history and clinical symptoms was, completed and a combined nose-throat swab was taken. Virus culture, rapid culture, and polymerase chain reaction (FCR) amplification, were performed on each specimen, Multivariate analysis was used to obtain the best predictive model, Results By using FCR, an increase was seen in the detection of the viral pathogens compared with the results of culture. in 42 out of 81 patients PCR was positive for influenza. A positive predictive value (PPV) of 75 % was observed for the combination of headache at onset, feverishness at onset, cough, and vaccination status during the period of increase influenza activity. Criteria used by the ICHPPC- 2 resulted in a PPV of 54 %. The PPV for diagnosis made by the GP was 76 %. Conclusion: Although influenza is difficult to diagnose on clinical grounds, the GPs in this study were able to diagnose influenza as such more accurately on their judgement than by the other criteria...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the role of picornavirus in flu-like episodes (temperature of > or = 38. 0 degrees C plus one respiratory and one <b>constitutional</b> <b>symptom)</b> among otherwise healthy adults enrolled in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized oseltamivir treatment study. Combined nasal and pharyngeal swabs were collected at baseline for influenza cultures and picornavirus reverse transcription (RT) -PCR. In addition, acute- and convalescent-serum samples were obtained for serological studies of common respiratory pathogens. From a total of 719 subjects enrolled in the clinical trial within 36 h of the onset of symptoms, 475 (66 %) had evidence of recent influenza A or B virus infections by means of culture and/or serological testing. Of the 244 remaining patients, 36 (15 %) presented a seroconversion for at least one of the common respiratory viruses or atypical pathogens. An RT-PCR assay for the picornavirus 5 " noncoding region (NCR) was positive in a subset of 15 (19 %) of 78 patients with flu-like illnesses of undetermined etiology. Sequence analysis of the picornavirus 5 " NCR amplicons revealed that 14 (93 %) of them had greater homology to rhinoviruses, whereas 1 (7 %) was related to enteroviruses. Interestingly, median total symptom scores and oral temperatures of picornavirus-positive patients (n = 15) and placebo-treated influenza virus-positive patients (n = 161) were similar over a 3 -week period. We conclude that, among the influenza virus-negative preselected cases of this study, rhinoviruses were relatively frequent pathogens associated with important respiratory and systemic symptoms...|$|R

Clinical and laboratory evaluations were observed from 420 adults and collected on a daily basis from outpatient care units at University Hospital. the ILI definition included: fever plus at least one respiratory symptom (cough and/or sore throat) and one <b>constitutional</b> <b>symptom</b> (headache, malaise, myalgia, sweat or chills, or fatigue). DFA and RT-PCR for influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, and metapneumovirus were performed on nasal washes and 61. 8 % resulted positive. the respiratory viruses detected most often were influenza and rhinovirus. ILI was reported for 240 / 420 patients (57. 1 %), with influenza and rhinovirus etiologies accounting for 30. 9 % and 19. 6 %, respectively. Rhinovirus peak activity was concurrent with the influenza season. These findings highlight the implications of other viruses in ILI etiology and suggest that during the influenza season, this clinical overlap must be considered in the diagnosis and clinical management of patients.
