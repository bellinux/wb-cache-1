50|$|A mini-VGA connector, {{which can}} provide VGA via a short <b>adaptor</b> <b>cable.</b> It {{appears on the}} white iBook, eMac, iMac G4 and G5, and first {{generation}} 12-inch PowerBook G4. Later models also support a composite and S-video adapter attached to this port.|$|R
50|$|In June 2012, Apple {{began selling}} a Thunderbolt-to-gigabit Ethernet <b>adaptor</b> <b>cable</b> for US$29. In {{the third quarter}} of 2012, other {{manufacturers}} started providing cables of varying lengths up to the maximum supported length of three meters, while some storage-enclosure builders began including a Thunderbolt cable with their devices.|$|R
50|$|A {{small number}} of marinas provide 230 V {{single-phase}} power through a red three-phase connector (breaking the relevant standards in the process). This goes some way to ensuring that only boats that have paid the required fee (and thus obtained an appropriately made-up <b>adaptor</b> <b>cable)</b> are {{able to use the}} electricity.|$|R
25|$|Mobile device {{applications}} allow mobile {{devices such}} as cell phones and tablets to display and manipulate the OBD-II data accessed via USB <b>adaptor</b> <b>cables,</b> bluetooth or WiFi adapters plugged into the car's OBD II connector. A number of new devices allow the vehicle's OBD port to stream data directly to the Internet via a cellular connection.|$|R

50|$|Before the {{legislation}} of the Electrical Products Regulation (a few {{years prior to}} the handover in 1997), British standard extension <b>cables,</b> plugs and <b>adaptors</b> were seldom found in the market. Electrical appliances were fitted with 2-pin plugs and quasi-UK three pin plugs (which meant they were compatible with BS 1363 or BS 546 sockets, but the plug itself did not comply with the British Standard).|$|R
40|$|The {{techniques}} and hardware are described which were developed for facilitating {{the use of}} flexible flat conductor cable (FFCC) in commercial air transports. The system was designed as an evolutionary transition from the current round wire harnessing {{to the use of}} FFCC harnesses. The equipment discussed includes the pressure crimp barrel designed for terminating FFCC, reel-fed applicator, <b>cable</b> connectors and <b>adaptors,</b> and equipment racks...|$|R
5000|$|Included {{with the}} phone are earbuds Amazon claims to be [...] "tangle-free"; the earbud tips can be {{attached}} to each other magnetically and also have a flat cable {{in order to minimize}} tangling. These earbuds can be purchased separately as a standalone accessory. Also included {{with the phone}} are the USB <b>cable</b> and power <b>adaptor,</b> as well as a quick start guide. The phone is available only in black, but first-party cases can be purchased in black/cayenne leather or black/cayenne/citron/blue/royal polyurethane.|$|R
5000|$|... 100BASE-TX is the {{predominant}} form of Fast Ethernet, and runs over two wire-pairs inside a category 5 or above cable. Like 10BASE-T, the active pairs {{in a standard}} connection are terminated on pins 1, 2, 3 and 6. Since a typical category 5 cable contains 4 pairs, it can support two 100BASE-TX links with a wiring <b>adaptor.</b> <b>Cabling</b> is conventional wired to TIA/EIA-568-B's termination standards, T568A or T568B. This places the active pairs on the orange and green pairs (canonical second and third pairs).|$|R
40|$|Lithium Tantalate {{exhibits}} excellent electro-optical, piezoelectric and pyroelectric {{properties and}} a very low thermal expansion. In this paper, we report measurements of loss tangent and the real part of the relative permittivity r measured in c-axis LiTaO 3 crystals in the temperature range from 14 K to 295 K at a frequency of 11. 4 GHz and 10 GHz. Microwave properties of LiTaO 3 were determined by measurements of the resonance frequency and the unloaded Qo-factor of a TE 011 mode cylindrical cavity containing the sample under test and accounting for uncalibrated <b>cables</b> and <b>adaptors</b> inside the cryocooler. The permittivity of LiTaO 3 was found to increase from 38. 9 to 41. 1 and the loss tangent to change from 1. 1 × 10 - 4 to 6. 5 × 10 - 4 over the full temperature range. Due to its low loss and relatively high permittivity Lithium Tantalate is suitable for microwave applications...|$|R
50|$|Peterson Tuners {{released}} a Virtual Strobe tuning application in 2009 as a professional-grade tuning app for Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch. The application leverages the Virtual Strobe display and provides chromatic tuning with Peterson's renowned standard tuning resolution of 0.1 cent. In 2010, Peterson {{released a}} native iPad version that offers unique functions on the iPad platform that includes VGA output support for classroom usage and manual note selection. An <b>adaptor</b> <b>cable</b> {{designed specifically for}} use with the Apple devices was also introduced to support the app and offer users an entry-level package solution. Per the iTunes store 7/14/2015, Peterson has renamed/created a new product for i devices called iStroboSoft.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2004 Sharp {{announced}} the SL-C3000 - the world's first PDA with an integrated {{hard disk drive}} (preceding the Palm Life Drive [...] ). It featured a similar hardware and software specification to the earlier C860 model; the key differences were that it only had 16 MB of flash memory yet gained an internal 4 GB Hitachi microdrive, a USB Host port, and [...] "lost" [...] the serial port (in some cases the components were not fitted to the motherboard or were incapable of driving the regular serial <b>adaptor</b> <b>cables).</b> The keyboard feel and layout changed somewhat, and most owners preferred it over the 760/860.|$|R
50|$|In Italy, CEI 23-50 is the {{dominant}} standard and it includes also Schuko sockets (P 30 = CEE 7/3) and plugs (S 30 = CEE 7/4, S 31 = CEE 7/7, S 32 = CEE 7/17). Appliances are commonly sold with Schuko-type plugs (as well as Europlugs), while Italian-type plugs have become rare today and almost only power strips, <b>cable</b> reels and <b>adaptors</b> are sold with them. Some sockets (P 30 and P 40) accept both types, the remainder accepting one or the other. Schuko sockets are most commonly used for larger-rated appliances such as washing machines, and are particularly common in South Tyrol, with its cultural, economic and tourist connections with Austria.|$|R
50|$|Freesat {{is a free}} {{satellite}} service created jointly by the BBC and ITV. In contrast to Freesat from Sky, it does not need a viewing card. It is the UK's first provider of high definition television without a subscription; one HD channel was available at launch. Freesat now provides five HD channels, BBC One HD, BBC Two HD, ITV HD, Channel 4 HD and NHK World HD. Freesat currently provides the BBC iPlayer in terms of video on demand, which has been rolled out to all compatible HD receivers, and ITV Hub is currently testing, available only to Humax boxes at the present time. To access on-demand services, {{you must have a}} broadband connection of at least 1 Mbit/s, and an ethernet connection is required (using either a <b>cable</b> or Homeplug <b>adaptors).</b>|$|R
40|$|Barium Fluoride (BaF 2), mainly used in optical applications, {{has similar}} {{properties}} {{to those of}} CaF 2 but better stability under environmental conditions. In this paper, we report measurements of loss tangent and the real part of the relative permittivity εr of single crystal BaF 2 in the temperature range from 14 to 290 K at frequencies of 8, 10. 4, 12. 1, 17. 6, 21. 1 and 24. 4 GHz. Microwave properties of BaF 2 were determined by measurements of the resonance frequency and the unloaded Q-factor of TE 011 and quasi TE 0 mn modes cylindrical cavities containing the sample under test. Two techniques namely Hakki–Coleman Dielectric Resonator and dielectric post resonators {{have been used for}} characterizing the dielectric material. Losses due to the uncalibrated <b>cables</b> and <b>adaptors</b> inside the cryocooler are accounted in the calculation of unloaded Q-factor using the Transmission Mode Q-Factor data processing technique. The permittivity of BaF 2 exhibited a 5 % increase from 6. 9 (14 K) to 7. 35 (290 K). The loss tangent increased from 1 × 10 − 5 to 1. 1 × 10 − 4 over the measured temperature range, 14 – 290 K at a frequency of 10. 4 GHz. The measured microwave properties show that BaF 2 can be used in many microwave devices...|$|R
