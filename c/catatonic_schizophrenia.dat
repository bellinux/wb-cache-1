40|$|Electrotherapy is considered a very {{effective}} and safe therapeutic method. Its most frequently described adverse effect is the impairment of cognitive functions. Currently, the most commonly applied form of electrotherapy are bitemporal procedures and the most frequent and best-studied indication for its application are depressive disorders. A method combining high effectiveness with satisfactory safety is the bifrontal application of the electrodes, although study results are often inconsistent. An issue which {{should also be noted}} is the lack of studies comparing the effectiveness of bifrontal and bitemporal procedures in the reduction of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and assessing the safety of these methods in terms of the influence on cognitive functions. The present paper presents a clinical description of four patients with schizophrenia who have undergone electrotherapy procedures performed applying the bifrontal method. The decisive indication for applying the bifrontal procedures were the memory disturbances the persistence of which was reported by the patients during the application of bitemporal procedures. The analysed clinical cases indicate the effectiveness of the bifrontal electrotherapy procedures which was comparable with the effectiveness of bitemporal procedures with the simultaneous better toleration of the former.

40|$|Catatonia was {{delineated}} {{only as a}} type {{of schizophrenia}} in the many American Psychiatric Association DSM classifications and revisions from 1952 until 1994 when “catatonia secondary to a medical condition” was added. Since the 1970 s the diagnosis of catatonia has been clarified as a syndrome of rigidity, posturing, mutism, negativism, and other motor signs of acute onset. It is found in about 10 % of psychiatric hospital admissions, in patients with depressed and manic mood states and in toxic states. It is quickly treatable to remission by benzodiazepines and by ECT. The DSM-V revision proposes catatonia in two major diagnostic classes, specifiers for 10 principal diagnoses, and deletion of the designation of <b>schizophrenia,</b> <b>catatonic</b> type.

40|$|Case. We {{report a}} case of {{catatonia}} with elevated CK, elevated temperature, and hypoferritinemia after abrupt discontinuation of clozapine in a patient with known proneness to catatonic symptoms. Reinstatement of clozapine therapy was contraindicated due to leukopenia. Neuroleptic malign syndrome could {{not be ruled out}} by the administration of quetiapine; this prevented the quick use of other potent D 2 antagonists.

Discussion. <b>Catatonic</b> symptoms in <b>schizophrenia</b> as well as in NMS might be caused by a lack of striatal dopamine (CS) or dopamine D 2 antagonism (NMS).

40|$|Aim. The aim of {{the study}} was to assess {{efficacy}} and safety of electroconvulsive therapy. Methods. 43 patients included into the study were hospitalised in The Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology and received all together over 400 bilateral electroconvulsive procedures. Most of the patients (N= 25) were qualified for electroconvulsive therapy due to treatment resistant depression (58. 1 %). Six patients: 2 with catatonia and 4 with depression had life saving indications for electroconvulsive therapy. Three patients (7 %) were excluded from electroconvulsive therapy, following 1 or 2 electroconvulsive procedures. Forty patients continued electroconvulsive therapy. Results. There were no complications and serious adverse events in patients who continued electroconvulsive therapy. Generally, electroconvulsive therapy was well tolerated and treatment had been cut down in only one case due to adverse events and high risk related to the procedure. Transient cardiac arrhythmias (10 % of patients) were the most often occurring adverse events and patients (35 %) mostly reported headaches. We observed remission in 22 patients (58 %) and improvement in 14 patients (35 %) following electroconvulsive treatment. Only 4 patients (10 %) had no benefit after a series of electroconvulsive procedures. Electroconvulsive treatment was most effective in patients with catatonia (80 % patients had full recovery) and in depressive patients with bipolar disorder (73 % patients had full recovery). Conclusion. Electroconvulsive procedures were safe and effective. Electroconvulsive treatment was most effective in <b>catatonic</b> patients with <b>schizophrenia</b> and in depressive patients with bipolar disorder...|$|R

40|$|Catatonia is a {{clinical}} syndrome {{associated with a}} wide variety of psychiatric, medical and neurological disorders. Despite several reports in the literature of a wide range of medical and neurological diseases causing catatonia, there has been a tendency to consider catatonia as purely osychiatric disorder. The review attempts to look at the concept of organic catatonia from a historical viewpoint, including its place in the psychiatric classification, discusses the various etiological causes of organic catatonia, and them goes through some important management issues in organic catatonia. The review suggests that organic catatonic disorder must be first considered in every patient with catatonic signs, particularly in a patient with new onset catatonia. Key words: Catatonia, organic catatonia, organic catatonic disorder There has been a tendency to consider r catatonia as a purely psychiatric disorder, despite many case reports demonstrating a wide range of medical and neurological diseases, as well as psychiatric causes, associated with catatonic symptomatology (Barnes et al, 1986, Clark & Rickards, 1999 a). The common occurrence of <b>catatonic</b> symptoms in <b>schizophrenia</b> has in fact diminished, with most catatonic symptoms presenting now in association with either mood disorders or general medical conditions (Blumer, 1997). Actually, few phenomena in psychiatry or neurology are as enigmatic as catatonia (Lohr & Wisniewski, 1987). This is partly due to the many contradictions surrounding the concept of catatonia. Catatonia has been variously described as a disease (Kahlbaum, 1874), a syndrome (Gelenberg, 1976), a non-specific symptom (Peralta et al, 1997), a subtype of schizophrenia (Kraepelin, 1919; Bleuler, 1950), and as a symptom seen more commonly in mood disorders (Abrams & Taylor, 1976). Strangely enough, it is both caused as well as ameliorated by neuroleptics (Lohr & Wisniewski, 1987) ...|$|R

Subsequently, this autoimmune limbic encephalitis has been noticed by many psychiatrists. For a differential diagnosis of catatonic state, it is important to detect anti-NMDAR encephalitis. This encephalitis is expected to be in remission by early detection and treatment. We should be more cautious about <b>catatonic</b> symptoms of <b>schizophrenia.</b> When a patient is being doubted with encephalitis, we should screen for anti-NMDAR antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid samples using a cell-based assay. We describe the methods of NMDAR antibody detection and the etiology of this encephalitis with case reports. Two representative cases with catatonia and non-catatonia (brief psychotic disorder) were reported. Schizophrenia is a general, heterogeneous, and complicated disorder, and its pathophysiology is unknown. There is an established evidence of NMDAR hypofunction, which is the functional disconnection of the central component; {{this is one of the}} most recognized models for schizophrenia. Furthermore, it is said that autoimmune mechanisms have been involved, at least in subgroups of schizophrenia patients.
