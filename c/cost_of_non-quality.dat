40|$|Data {{governance}} is {{a subject}} that is becoming increasingly important in business and government. In fact, good governance data allows improved interactions between employees {{of one or more}} organizations. Data quality represents a great challenge because the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-quality</b> can be very high. Therefore the use of data quality becomes an absolute necessity within an organization. To improve the data quality in a Big-Data source, our purpose, in this paper, is to add semantics to data and help user to recognize the Big-Data schema. The originality of this approach lies in the semantic aspect it offers. It detects issues in data and proposes a data schema by applying a se-mantic data profiling...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Telecommunication {{switching}} software challenges {{the development process}} {{with the need to}} continuously update a product line architecture with new features, while simultaneously synchronizing across related product lines that are operational in a global setting. Serving an installed base of over 130 million lines with market-specific variants that have been continuously growing {{for more than a decade}} needs careful harmonization of product line evolution with serving customer needs. The focus of this case study is on quality improvement with code inspections and integration testing in a product line architecture. Improving customer perceived quality and at the same time lowering the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-quality</b> are the two primary objectives of the process reengineering activity. The return on investment of described improvements was significant. Several results on the relationships between validation processes, fault detection effectiveness and product quality are discussed. Experiences from over 50 projects of various size that were developed and deployed during ’ 95 [...] . ’ 98 by Alcatel are included to show practical impacts that can also be transferred to other projects...|$|E

The different phases of the production process are studied; each phase is detailed in terms <b>of</b> time and <b>costs.</b> Time and cost increments, {{due to the lack}} of quality during the production process, are defined and calculated. A computer program for the numerical evaluation of such quantities, realized by the Authors, is described. Some numerical results, presented in the paper, confirm that Quality is not a cost, but a saving, even from the point of view of short-term benefits.

40|$|Quality has a {{cost and}} this fact cannot be denied. In the same time, {{it is true}} that non-quality is more expensive.

According to this idea all economic sectors contain error costs caused by the mistakes made during the production process.

40|$|Embedded {{memories}} {{have become}} {{integral part of}} any system on chip (SOC) occupying about 60 % of the chip area in most cases. Memories which often are delivered as Intellectual Property (IP), if defective can affect the time-to-market of a chip because {{of the amount of}} time spent in debugging or even worse may result in a re-spin. Hence it is of utmost importance to ensure that the memory is bug free during design phase itself. This session will focus on developing an exhaustive, reusable and configurable test-environment to verify the behavioral memory models. The session shall also provide information on the traditional methods of verification and their problems. It will discuss in detail about developing an automated testbench and its advantages in terms of its functional coverage and reusability. Specman (4. 3. 4) based verification has been employed for developing an automated test environment for behavioral memory models. This methodology was used to develop a shared test environment which can verify different types of memories like single-port, dual-port and rom. With the introduction of Specman for verification 45 defects (for memories in one technology) were identified in the behavioral memory models, which were not caught by traditional Verilog/VHDL testbenches so resulting in reducing the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-quality</b> to very large extent. Using this methodology not only ensures that the customer gets high quality memory models but also provides a plug and play memory eVC which can be used during system level verification. 2 1...|$|E

In particular, are analyzed correlations of NPLs with impact factors of macro level that determine their formation, but also the NPLs feedback, especially on the economy.

40|$|As signalled by {{the lack}} of {{discussion}} about software development methodologies in the literature, it may reliably be argued that the general approach to CALL software development suffers from the use of immature software engineering practices, the result being that most practitioners in the field build systems that are idiosyncratic, prone to error and difficult to maintain.

This requirement imposes the implementation of effective strategies for evaluating energetic performances. However, most of the literature works focused {{on the use of}} analytical approaches which sometimes proves insufficient, in the absence of taking into account the practical realities. This paper presents a methodology of risk analysis and assessment for efficient performance of buildings using the knowledge capitalization and exploitation from experience feedback processes. The target buildings (residential, tertiary and commercial) are chosen in the airport area of aeronautic context in which the lessons learnt are generated from the environmental assessment {{with the assistance of the}} main domain actors (experts, technicians and users). The effort is focused on identification <b>of</b> <b>non-qualities</b> and discomforts whose resolution could contribute to improving the energy and environmental performance of buildings. This approach integrates the collection of experienced knowledge from passive design strategies of sustainable buildings with innovative practices. Capitalization of knowledge from experience feedback processes will foster the development of proposals for preventive and corrective solutions and dissemination of good practices for solving problems regarding pathologies, damage, and other dysfunctions observed in the building field...|$|R
