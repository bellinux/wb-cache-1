40|$|The {{use of the}} Aerospace Price Book, a cost index, and <b>conceptual</b> <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> for {{cost-effective}} {{design and}} construction of space facilities is discussed. The price book consists of over 200 commonly used conceptual elements and 100 systems summaries of projects such as launch pads, processing facilities, and air locks. The cost index is composed of three divisions: (1) bid summaries of major Shuttle projects, (2) budget cost data sheets, and (3) cost management summaries; each of these divisions is described. Conceptual estimates of facilities and ground support equipment are required to provide the most probable project cost for budget, funding, and project approval purposes.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{availability}} of a good, complete scope definition {{in the early stages}} of a project is widely recognized by industry practitioners as a key factor for overall project success. This paper presents a Project Scope Modeling Methodology for computerized decision support during the definition of a new project scope. The methodology is based on the effective reutilization of historical project scope definitions through the application of Case Based Reasoning (CBR), an Artificial Intelligence approach. In CBR, the previous experiences are reused in solving new situations reducing the complexities of modeling reasoning processes. By using CBR, the scope modeling methodology helps to find and reuse the most relevant historical information, allowing to easily consult and combine information from multiple scope definitions in a computerized environment. The resulting scope definitions are ready to serve as input information for different planning purposes. The application for <b>conceptual</b> <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> is discussed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the findings of}} a previous research project, which examined the area of decision support {{as it relates to the}} generation of real estate conceptual cost estimates (Nobe, 1996). The purpose of this research was to evaluate a prototype development cost estimating decision support system for use in the pre-development planning stage of real estate development. The system evaluated was the Real Estate Development Decision Support System (REDDS?), which is currently in the prototype stage of development. The system was tested on a group of real estate development and construction management students at Texas A&M University. It was hypothesized that an interdisciplinary methodology, which utilizes a decision support framework, would facilitate generation of consistent and timely analysis of real estate development cost and associated risk, and elevate the confidence of the user in the estimating decision making process. Test results indicate that the REDDS? system does significantly reduce <b>conceptual</b> <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> preparation time. However, it was also determined that the REDDS? system does not significantly change the confidence of the user in the decision making process. Finally, this research shows that the use of the REDDS? system provides a consistent and sophisticated framework for evaluating development cost and risk, which leads to less variation and more accurate estimates...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Conceptual <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in project feasibility study. In practice, it is performed based on estimator’s experience. However, due to the inaccuracy of <b>cost</b> <b>estimate,</b> budgeting and <b>cost</b> control are planned and executed inefficiently. Support Vector Machines (SVMs), an Artificial Intelligent technique, is used to conduct the construction <b>cost</b> <b>estimate.</b> The algorithms of SVMs solve a convex optimization problem in a relative short time with satisfied accurate solution. Applying SVMs, the construction <b>conceptual</b> <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> model is developed for owners and planners to predict the construction cost of a project. The impact factors of <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> are identified through literature review and interview with experts. The cost data of 29 construction projects are used as training cases. Based on the training results, the average prediction error is less than 10 % and the computation time is less than 5 minutes. The error is satisfied for the <b>conceptual</b> <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> of a project during the planning and conceptual design phase. Case studies show SVMs can efficiently and accurately assist planners to predict the construction cost...|$|R
40|$|Location {{factors are}} used to adjust <b>conceptual</b> <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> by project location. Presently, the {{construction}} industry has adopted a simple, proximity-based interpolation method which uses the “nearest neighbor” location factor to estimate unknown location factors. Although this approach is widely accepted, its validity has not been statistically substantiated. This study assessed the current method of adjusting <b>conceptual</b> <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> by project location. An evaluation of 14 alternative spatial estimation methods was also conducted. These methods were based on different approaches for combining 4 criteria: proximity, state boundary, home value, and income. This study used the 2006 RSMeans city cost index (CCI) dataset to conduct the evaluation. Geographic information systems (GIS) were used to visualize data and conduct spatial-statistical evaluations. The Global Moran’s I {{test was used to}} assess proximity-based spatial interpolation, which was implemented in the current method. In addition, comparisons of the current method and alternative methods were statistically assessed. The statistical analysis consisted of box plots, histograms, homogeneity of variance tests (Levene’s Statistic), and equality of sample distribution medians tests (Mann-Whitney). From interpretations of results, it was concluded that the Moran’s I test provided statistical justification for the current method. In addition, an alternative method was statistically proven to outperform the current method. This alternative method was the conditional nearest neighbor (CNN). Moreover, an additional alternative method which incorporated the ranking of proximity, median home values, and state boundaries could potentially outperform the current method as well as the CNN method. Future research is needed to fully substantiate the additional alternative method. Master of Construction ManagementMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|Cost {{estimates}} {{are considered the}} most important and critical mission during the life cycle of a construction project. Preparing reliable and accurate estimates to help decision makers is the most challenging assignment that cost engineers and estimators can face. For decades, the construction industry focused on acquiring the construction costs of building facilities, neglecting the associated costs of running and maintaining them. Currently, by contrast, owners are interested in investigating the economics of facility management, which are the cost of owning and operating the building over its useful life. This thesis presents a methodology {{that can be used for}} an integrated <b>conceptual</b> <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> and life-cycle costing system for building projects. The methodology describes the development and implementation of a system that automates the preparation of conceptual cost estimates and forecasts future costs of running building projects. This methodology does so by joining Computer Integrated Construction (CIC) and Virtual Reality Environment (VRE). The system integrates relational databases, a preliminary estimate module, an AutoCAD module, a global module, a cost estimate forecasting and decision support-system modules, and life-cycle costing and sensitivity analysis modules. A modification in building design will result in an automatic generation of a new conceptual estimate. Subsequently, this modified drawing can be virtually animated and visualized by using a Virtual Reality browser. Finally, once capital costs are identified, the system forecasts the cost of running and maintaining the new building during its expected service life. Then, after assigning the range of deviation, it applies a sensitivity analysis method to investigate the most sensitive parameters so that further attention can be directed. Designing the system in a user-friendly environment allows owners and decision makers to envision the feasibility of new building projects within their anticipated life cycle. Moreover, it assists architects and cost engineers to generate conceptual cost estimates in a dynamic environment. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the usefulness and capabilities of the developed system...|$|E
40|$|<b>Conceptual</b> <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> (CCE) is a {{challenging}} task for highway agencies {{due to the}} limited design information available at early stages of project development. As a result, agencies frequently experience large variance from the initial construction estimate to the final cost. Despite the initial estimate’s low level of confidence, it is required for all highway projects as an input to feasibility studies and to establish the project’s budget. Many authors have explored the use of artificial intelligence and multiple-regression analysis with promising findings to aide CCE. Unfortunately, at this writing, no highway agencies {{are known to have}} implemented these data-driven techniques in practice. One of many reasons for this situation is related to a belief that accurate quantities of work are required to produce an accurate estimate. This approach is termed ‘bottom-up’ estimating and is clearly impossible at the initial stage of project development. A second reason relates to the investment necessary to create a reliable database structure that permits high-level statistical analysis. Therefore, this thesis seeks to investigate improvements to data-driven, ‘top-down’ CCE methods to enable practical application. Firstly, a method to rationally select data used in the model is investigated. The analysis reported in this thesis found that random sampling does not test the true performance of a model for its future application. Secondly, a method to select input variables that have the largest impact on predicting the construction cost but require the least amount of effort is proposed. The models reached a point whereby expending additional effort to include more input variables did not yield an increased performance and debunked the notion that ‘bottom-up’ estimating approaches are intuitively more accurate. This finding is significant for practitioners as resources expended to collect and store additional data points than required is wasted at the conceptual stage. Finally, a method to express the conceptual estimate stochastically is proposed. The traditional deterministic approach of relying on a specific number communicates false precision. This thesis proposes combining artificial neural networks with bootstrap sampling to create an empirical distribution of the construction costs and better communicate a likely range of project costs...|$|E
40|$|Emerging sciences, such as <b>conceptual</b> <b>cost</b> <b>estimating,</b> {{seem to have}} to {{go through}} two phases. The first phase {{involves}} reducing the field of study down to its basic ingredients - from systems development to technological development (techniques) to theoretical development. The second phase operates in the direction in building up techniques from theories, and systems from techniques. 	Cost estimating is clearly and distinctly still in the first phase. 	A great deal of effort has been put into the development of both manual and computer based cost estimating systems during this first phase and, to a lesser extent, the development of a range of techniques that can be used (see, for instance, Ashworth & Skitmore, 1986). 	Theoretical developments have not, as yet, been forthcoming. All theories need the support of some observational data and cost estimating is not likely to be an exception. 	These data do not need to be complete in order to build theories. 	As it is possible to construct an image of a prehistoric animal such as the brontosaurus from only a few key bones and relics, so a theory of cost estimating may possibly be found on a few factual details. The eternal argument of empiricists and deductionists is that, as theories need factual support, so do we need theories in order to know what facts to collect. 	In cost estimating, the basic facts of interest concern accuracy, the cost of achieving this accuracy, and the trade off between the two. 	When cost estimating theories do begin to emerge, it is highly likely that these relationships will be central features. This paper presents some of the facts we have been able to acquire regarding one part of this relationship - accuracy, and its influencing factors. Although some of these factors, such as the amount of information used in preparing the estimate, will have cost consequences, we have not yet reached the stage of quantifying these costs. 	Indeed, as will be seen, many of the factors do not involve any substantial cost considerations. The absence of any theory is reflected in the arbitrary manner in which the factors are presented. Rather, the emphasis here is on the consideration of purely empirical data concerning estimating accuracy. The essence of good empirical research is to. minimize the role of the researcher in interpreting the results of the study. 	Whilst space does not allow a full treatment of the material in this manner, the principle has been adopted as closely as possible to present results in an uncleaned and unbiased way. 	In most cases the evidence speaks for itself. The first part of the paper reviews most of the empirical evidence that we have located to date. Knowledge of any work done, but omitted here would be most welcome. 	The second part of the paper presents an analysis of some recently acquired data pertaining to this growing subject. ...|$|E

Although they present the lowest expected accuracy, they are often used by key people involved in the construction process, thus playing a significant role. Bridge construction has increased over the last years, often exhibiting substantial overruns above <b>estimated</b> <b>costs.</b> To overcome this problem, it is crucial for the decision makers to have an early estimate of the final cost based on previous experience.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a neural network-based <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> method, {{developed for the}} generation of <b>conceptual</b> <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> for low-rise prefabricated structural steel buildings. Detailed <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> is current practice {{for this type of}} buildings, since cost estimators are often challenged by a wide variety of different parameters. The developed method employs neural networks (NNs) for modeling individual project parameters associated with the direct cost of a project. It integrates NN cost models with cost adjustments, allowing for evaluation of different project alternatives, in a timely manner. The ability of NNs to capture real life experiences encountered on actual projects (i. e. actual costs), generalize and utilize that knowledge for <b>estimating</b> the <b>cost</b> of new projects makes it a very powerful tool to the application at hand. Data used in this study (75 building projects) were collected from a large manufacturer of prefabricated structural steel buildings in Canada (Canam Manac) over a 3 -month period. The performance of developed cost models was tested against costs incurred by projects not used in training of those models, and costs predicted by regression. Results indicate that the proposed models, when used for projects with parameters within the range for which the models were trained, outperform regression. In addition, the proposed models can account for a number of parameters defining a project, and bearing considerable impact on the project cost.

40|$|Bridge Information Modeling (BrIM), as a concept, {{has been}} {{introduced}} to enhance the procedures of the whole phases of a bridge life-cycle starting with concept and design, through construction and operation, and ending with maintenance and rehabilitation.

The main objective {{of this research is}} to develop an integrated model that helps owners, designers and construction managers visualize bridge projects in a 3 D mode and accordingly automate the process of generating preliminary <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> during the <b>conceptual</b> design stage.

40|$|Escalation of {{right-of-way}} (ROW) {{costs have}} been shown to be a prime contributor to project cost escalation in the highway industry.

Data collection was completed through interviews of seven state highway agencies (SHAs) and two local public agencies (LPAs). The findings of the research are presented in a set of ROW flowcharts which document the steps, inputs, and outputs of the ROW cost estimation and <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> management process. Three ROW <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> and a <b>cost</b> management process take place throughout project development. An effort was made from the onset of the research to relate the ROW <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> and <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> management process to the first four project development phases (planning, programming. preliminary design, and final design). There are five flowcharts produced as a result of this research: 1) an agency-level flowchart showing all <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> and the interaction of ROW with the project development process; 2) a <b>conceptual</b> ROW <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> flowchart which depicts the required steps during planning; 3) a baseline ROW <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> flowchart which depicts the required steps during programming; 4) an update ROW <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> flowchart which depicts the required steps during preliminary design to include a <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> management loop; and 5) a ROW cost management flowchart which depicts the required steps during final design.

Two scenarios are presented, one using column flotation technology and the other the selective agglomeration to clean the coal to the required quality specifications. This study forms part of US Department of Energy program �Engineering Development of Advanced Physical Fine Coal Cleaning for Premium Fuel Applications,� (Contract No. DE-AC 22 - 92 PC 92208), under Task 11, Project Final Report. The primary objective of the Department of Energy program is to develop the design base for prototype commercial advanced fine coal cleaning facilities capable of producing ultra-clean coals suitable for conversion to stable and highly loaded CWF. The fuels should contain less than 2 lb ash/MBtu (860 grams ash/GJ) of HHV and preferably less than 1 lb ash/MBtu (430 grams ash/GJ). The advanced fine coal cleaning technologies to be employed are advanced column froth flotation and selective agglomeration. It is further stipulated that operating conditions during the advanced cleaning process should recover not less than 80 percent of the carbon content (heating value) in the run-of-mine source coal. These goals for ultra-clean coal quality are to be met under the constraint that annualized coal production costs does not exceed $ 2. 5 /MBtu ($ 2. 37 /GJ), including the mine mouth cost of the raw coal. A further objective of the program is to determine the distribution of a selected suite of eleven toxic trace elements between product CWF and the refuse stream of the cleaning processes. Laboratory, bench-scale and Process Development Unit (PDU) tests to evaluate advanced column flotation and selective agglomeration were completed earlier under this program with selected coal samples. A PDU with a capacity of 2 st/h was designed by Bechtel and installed at Amax R&D, Golden, Colorado by Entech Global for process evaluation tests. The tests successfully demonstrated the capability of advanced column flotation as well as selective agglomeration to produce ultra-clean coal at specified levels of purity and recovery efficiency. Test results and the experience gained during the operation of the PDU have provided valuable insights into the processes studied. Based on the design data obtained from the test work and a set of project design criteria, two sets of conceptual designs for commercial CWF production plants have been developed, one using column flotation and the other using selective agglomeration process. Using these designs, Capital as well as Operating and Maintenance (O&M) <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> for the plants have been compiled. These estimates have then been used to derive the annualized cost of production of premium CWF on a commercial scale. Further, a series of sensitivity analysis have been completed to evaluate the effects of variations in selected cost components and process parameters on the overall economics of premium fuel productio...|$|R
40|$|Accuracy in <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> under {{conditions}} of uncertainty, as is typical of most construction projects, {{is an issue of}} immense concern for clients, project managers, contractors, and all other stakeholders in construction works. It is an issue of continuing interest and has attracted a lot of scholarly attention from researchers and innovators. Accurate <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> are needed for planning and budgetary phases of road projects by highway agencies. Highway projects have historically experienced significant cost overruns often rooted at the point of the decision to build. However the basis for assessing the level of cost overruns continues to elicit diverse opinions and has become a debatable issue in the literature, with some authors alluding to the estimate developed at the detailed design stage as opposed to the preliminary conceptual estimate as the true benchmark to be used in quantifying the level of cost overrun. A survey of literature sources principally from scholarly articles and research programs undertaken by various highway agencies is carried out, with a view to identifying and defining the critical phase of development which should constitute the basis upon which investment estimates are to be predicated. This paper thus evaluates and synthesizes the theoretical basis of accuracy in estimating, outlines the nomenclature of the developmental phases of highway projects as evident in the literature and builds upon the argument raised by earlier authors: Wachs (1989); Simon (1991) and Flyvbjerg et al (2002).

40|$|A {{technical}} feasibility assessment was performed for retrofitting oxy-fuel technology to an existing power plant burning low sulfur PRB fuel and high sulfur bituminous fuel. The {{focus of this}} study was on the boiler/power generation island of a subcritical steam cycle power plant. The power plant performance in air and oxy-firing modes was estimated and modifications required for oxy-firing capabilities were identified. A 460 MWe (gross) reference subcritical PC power plant was modeled. The reference air-fired plant has a boiler efficiency (PRB/Bituminous) of 86. 7 %/ 89. 3 % and a plant net efficiency of 35. 8 / 36. 7 %. Net efficiency for oxy-fuel firing including ASU/CPU duty is 25. 6 %/ 26. 6 % (PRB/Bituminous). The oxy-fuel flue gas recirculation flow to the boiler is 68 %/ 72 % (PRB/bituminous) of the flue gas (average O{sub 2 } in feed gas is 27. 4 %/ 26. 4 %v (PRB/bituminous)). Maximum increase in tube wall temperature is less than 10 ÂºF for oxy-fuel firing. For oxy-fuel firing, ammonia injected to the SCR was shut-off and the FGD is applied to remove SOx from the recycled primary gas stream and a portion of the SOx from the secondary stream for the high sulfur bituminous coal. Based on CFD simulations it was determined that at the furnace outlet compared to air-firing, SO{sub 3 }/SO{sub 2 } mole ratio is about the same, NOx ppmv level is about the same for PRB-firing and 2. 5 times for bituminous-firing due to shutting off the OFA, and CO mole fraction is approximately double. A <b>conceptual</b> level <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> was performed for the incremental equipment and installation cost of the oxyfuel retrofit in the boiler island and steam system. The cost of the retrofit is estimated to be approximately 81 M$ for PRB low sulfur fuel and 84 M$ for bituminous high sulfur fuel...|$|R

This paper examines the concept of competitiveness by relating the levels of the genopersistation recursion to cost. Introduction The <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> community focuses on how much systems <b>cost.</b> Some <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> are based on <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> relationships derived from data. Other <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> are based detailed a buildup of costs based upon perceived purchases, analogy, expert opinion, or just plain guesses. All <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> are just <b>estimates.</b> Most <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> {{have little or no}} relationship to the system which is finally delivered. Many <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> have little or no relationship to the final cost. Why? The <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> community rarely asks the question "Why will the system cost how much?" The <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> community rarely focuses on why a system will cost what it will.

40|$|The High Ranking Facilities Deactivation Project (HRFDP), {{commissioned}} by the US Department of Energy Nuclear Materials and Facility Stabilization Program, is to place four primary high-risk surplus facilities with 28 associated ancillary facilities at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in a safe, stable, and environmentally sound condition as rapidly and economically as possible. The facilities will be deactivated and left in a condition suitable {{for an extended period}} of minimized surveillance and maintenance (S and M) prior to decontaminating and decommissioning (D and D). These four facilities include two reactor facilities containing spent fuel. One of these reactor facilities also contains 55 tons of sodium with approximately 34 tons containing activated sodium- 22, 2. 5 tons of lithium hydride, approximately 100 tons of potentially contaminated lead, and several other hazardous materials as well as bulk quantities of contaminated scrap metals. The other two facilities to be transferred include a facility with a bank of hot cells containing high levels of transferable contamination and also a facility containing significant quantities of uranyl nitrate and quantities of transferable contamination.

50|$|A <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> is the {{approximation}} {{of the cost}} of a program, project, or operation. The <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> is the product of the <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> process. The <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> has a single total value and may have identifiable component values. A problem with a cost overrun can be avoided with a credible, reliable, and accurate <b>cost</b> <b>estimate.</b> A <b>cost</b> estimator is the professional who prepares <b>cost</b> <b>estimates.</b> There are different types of cost estimators, whose title may be preceded by a modifier, such as building estimator, or electrical estimator, or chief estimator. Other professional titles may also prepare <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> or contribute to <b>cost</b> <b>estimates,</b> such as quantity surveyors, cost engineers, etc. In the US, there were 185,400 cost estimators in 2010.
