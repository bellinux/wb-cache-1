It was fought between a column of French regular {{infantry}} under Brigadier Urbain Le Clerc de Juigné, governor of the nearby French-occupied Castellfollit de la Roca, and 16 companies of <b>Catalan</b> miquelets and several armed peasants at the orders of Ramon de Sala i Saçala, the veguer {{of the town of}} Vic. Juigné's force was in a punitive expedition to burn the village of Sant Esteve d'en Bas, whose inhabitants had refused to pay war contributions to the French army, when it was attacked by the <b>Catalan</b> militia and nearly destroyed in two separate engagements.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} super Barcelona {{has often been}} political. Though it is a club created and run by foreigners, Barcelona {{gradually}} became a club associated with <b>Catalan</b> values. In Spain's transition to autocracy in 1925, Catalonia became increasingly hostile towards the central government in Madrid. The hostility enhanced Barcelona's image as {{a focal point for}} Catalonism, and when Francisco Franco banned the use of the <b>Catalan</b> language, the stadium of Barcelona became {{one of the few places}} the people could express their dissatisfaction. The Spanish transition to democracy in 1978 has not dampened the club's image of <b>Catalan</b> pride. In the 2000s – a period of sporting success in the club and an increased focus on <b>Catalan</b> players – club officials have openly called for Catalonia to become an independent state.|$|E

5|$|During {{the same}} period, the club changed its {{official}} language from Castilian to <b>Catalan</b> and gradually evolved into an important symbol of <b>Catalan</b> identity. For many fans, {{participating in the}} club had {{less to do with}} the game itself and more with being a part of the club's collective identity. On 4 February 1917, the club held its first testimonial match to honour Ramón Torralba who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa, which Barcelona won 6–2.|$|E
5|$|Ebner has {{additionally}} written narrative fiction (novels, short stories, short prose), {{essays and}} poems.

He also translated the novel L'Absent written by the <b>Catalan</b> author Josep Navarro Santaeulàlia, into German. Ebner's cultural essays about <b>Catalan</b> culture, such as that of Barcelona and Andorra, have been published by the magazines Literatur und Kritik and Zitig. His first collection of short stories, Lose (Destinies), was published in 2007. Of its 45 stories, twenty-two had already been printed in newspapers, literary magazines or anthologies. In 2008, Ebner published two other books of narrative fiction, among them the short novel Hominide.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{was always}} in favour of <b>Catalan</b> culture but was {{reluctant}} to become politically active to campaign for its autonomy. Politicians, such as Francesc Cambó and Enric Prat de la Riba, suggested that he run for deputy but he refused. In 1920 he was beaten by police in a riot during the Floral Games celebrations. On 11 September 1924, National Day of Catalonia, he was beaten at a demonstration against the banning of the <b>Catalan</b> language by the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera. Gaudí was arrested by the Civil Guard, resulting in a short stay in prison, from which he was freed after paying 50 pesetas bail.|$|E

5|$|Three sources {{report in}} some detail on the events {{before and during the}} battle, all of them drawing on {{first-hand}} <b>Catalan</b> accounts and reflecting the <b>Catalan</b> point of view: the near-contemporary chronicle of Ramon Muntaner, the <b>Catalan</b> version of the Chronicle of the Morea, and the account found {{in the history of the}} Byzantine writer Nikephoros Gregoras (ca. 1359). According to the Chronicle of the Morea, the <b>Catalan</b> army comprised 2,000 cavalry and 4,000 infantry, at least 1,100 of whom were Turkish prisoners captured during their previous campaigns, and whose skill as archers they had come to value. Many of these Turks had even converted to Christianity. The sources differ on the size of Walter's army: Gregoras reports 6,400 cavalry and 8,000 infantry, the Aragonese version of the Chronicle of the Morea puts it at more than 2,000 cavalry and 4,000 infantry, while Ramon Muntaner asserts that it comprised 700 knights and 24,000 infantry, mostly native Greeks. Modern scholars consider these numbers to be clearly exaggerated, but they do suggest that the Athenian army had numerical superiority over the Catalans.|$|E

50|$|During {{one of his}} {{fights with}} the <b>Catalans</b> in the Sea of Marmara, he was {{defeated}} and captured by the <b>Catalans,</b> but {{was able to buy}} his freedom and returned to Tenedos. In 1306, he was back in action, and along with the Byzantines' Genoese allies participated in the unsuccessful siege of Gallipoli, which was held by the <b>Catalans.</b> In 1307 and 1308, along with other Byzantine-sponsored pirates, Morisco was active in the Aegean, attacking Venetian shipping off the Peloponnese.|$|R
50|$|In 1312, the <b>Catalans</b> {{recognized}} the suzerainty of King Frederick III of Sicily, who appointed his son Manfred as Duke. The ducal title {{remained in the}} hands of the Crown of Aragon until 1388, but actual authority was exercised by a series of vicars-general. In 1318/19 the <b>Catalans</b> conquered Siderokastron and the south of Thessaly as well, and created the Duchy of Neopatras, united to Athens. Part of Thessaly was conquered from the <b>Catalans</b> by the Serbs in the 1340s.|$|R
5|$|Despite this, Andronicus tried {{once more}} to strike a decisive blow back at the Turks, this time hiring <b>Catalan</b> mercenaries. Under the {{guidance}} of Michael IX and the leadership of Roger de Flor, the 6,500-strong <b>Catalan</b> Company {{in the spring and}} summer of 1303 managed to drive back the Turks. The mercenaries' onslaught drove the Turks back from Philadelphia to Cyzicus, in the process causing great destruction to the Anatolian landscape. Once again these gains were thwarted by internal matters. Roger de Flor was assassinated and, in revenge, his company began pillaging the Anatolian countryside. When they finally left in 1307 to attack Byzantine Thrace, the locals welcomed the Ottomans who once again began blockading key fortresses in Asia Minor.|$|E
5|$|Due to Gaudí's profoundly {{religious}} and ascetic lifestyle, {{the archbishop of}} Barcelona, Ricard Maria Carles proposed Gaudí's beatification in 1998. In 1999, American composer Christopher Rouse wrote the guitar concerto Concert de Gaudí, which was inspired by Gaudí's work; it {{went on to win}} the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition. On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of Gaudí's birth, a number of official ceremonies, concerts, shows and conferences were held, and several books were published. On 24 September of the same year, the musical Gaudí had its premiere in the Palau dels Esports de Barcelona. The authors of the piece were Jordi Galceran, Esteve Miralles and Albert Guinovart. In 2008 the Gaudí Awards were launched in his honour, organised by the <b>Catalan</b> Film Academy to award the best <b>Catalan</b> films of the year. An Iberia Airbus A340-642, EC-INO is named after Gaudí.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the new millennium, {{president}} Joan Laporta, a supporter of <b>Catalan</b> nationalism, repeatedly expressed his support of Catalonia's secession from Spain and characterised the club as the symbol for <b>Catalan</b> separatism. The politicalisation of the club drew criticism from several club members who accused Laporta of alienating Barcelona fans, both within and outside of Catalunya. By 2003 Barcelona had 1,200 penyes around the world, causing other Spanish clubs to copy the concept. With each individual peña (Castillian Spanish spelling) having different names and rules, it has become a custom in Spain to name a new peña after their favourite player or match, and in turn the player usually attends to the inaugural supper.|$|E
