50|$|The {{first two}} model years (XS-1 and XS-1B) were kick start only, with an {{electric}} starter added from the 1972 model year on. This had a <b>compression</b> <b>release</b> added to the front left exhaust tappet cover resulting in a square versus triangular cover found on the other exhaust and intake covers. Upon removal of the <b>compression</b> <b>release</b> mechanism in 1974 due to uprated starter, the square cover at the left exhaust valve was continued.|$|E

50|$|When activated, the Jacobs Engine Brake {{opens the}} exhaust valves {{near the top}} of the <b>compression</b> stroke, <b>releasing</b> the highly {{compressed}} air through the exhaust system. Little energy is returned to the piston, and as the cycle repeats, the energy of the trucks forward motion is dissipated, causing the truck to slow down.|$|R
5000|$|Occasionally called [...] "percussive aerophones", plosive aerophones are sounded by {{percussion}} {{caused by}} a single <b>compression</b> and <b>release</b> of air.

50|$|This type of {{retarder}} {{is known}} as Jake brake or <b>compression</b> <b>release</b> brake. A disadvantage of this system is that it becomes very noisy in operation, particularly if the exhaust muffler is faulty; its use is therefore banned in some locales.|$|E
50|$|Although Jake brake {{properly}} {{refers to}} the Jacobs brand of engine brakes, the term has become a genericized trademark and {{is often used to}} refer to engine brakes or <b>compression</b> <b>release</b> engine brakes in general, especially on large vehicles or heavy equipment.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to clarify the effect of repetitive compression on nerve physiology in an experimental rabbit model. We defined 80 mmHg as a compression force which caused temporary disturbance of nerve conduction and blood flow with a brief compression. The following compressions were applied for 30 minutes to rabbit sciatic nerves: continuous <b>compression,</b> low frequency <b>release</b> <b>compression</b> (1 second of release time every 30 seconds) and high frequency <b>release</b> <b>compression</b> (1 second of release time every 10 seconds). Compound nerve action potentials and nerve blood flow were evaluated from the start of compression until 30 minutes after release. Endoneurial microvascular permeability was evaluated with Evans Blue albumin. The repetitive compression groups showed delay in recovery of compound nerve action potentials and blood flow after release, with endoneurial oedema. These findings suggest that repetitive compression may increase the risk of breakdown of the blood nerve barrier...|$|R

50|$|A <b>compression</b> <b>release</b> engine brake, {{frequently}} {{called a}} Jake Nett brake or Jacobs brake, is an engine braking mechanism installed on some diesel engines.

5000|$|Brute force meets {{reliable}} {{power with}} the barako now made stronger with 15% more power while delivering 13% more fuel efficiency. Just when you thought that every barako would use its strength {{to get what he}} wants, this mean metal was built to prove otherwise. Boasting of the Kawasaki Automatic <b>Compression</b> <b>Release</b> KACR, it gives an easy kick start—no added fuss for men who mean real business. And just like what real men do, the <b>Compression</b> <b>release</b> takes away rider pressure, ensuring a smooth ride. Equipped with a powerful 176.6 cc engine, 4-stroke SOHC Euro-II compliant, and made with heavy-duty high-tensile steel, it could take on any bump or weather. Add a long dual seat to accommodate more passengers, and you get a mean machine that shares the pleasure. A fierce look, a sense for business, and a gentleman enough to think of its riders—now aren’t those signs of a true man? [...] "Tatak ng mas pinabarako".|$|E
5000|$|A <b>compression</b> <b>release</b> brake (also {{known as}} a Jacobs brake or [...] "jake brake"), {{is the type of}} brake most {{commonly}} confused with real engine braking; it is used mainly in large diesel trucks and works by opening the exhaust valves {{at the top of the}} compression stroke, so the large amount of energy stored in that compressed air is not returned to the crankshaft, but is released into the atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSpin {{crossover}} multiferroic [Fe(PM-BiA) 2 (NCS) 2] is {{investigated for}} the first time with the first order reversal curve (FORC) diagram method for its hysteretic pressure behavior. The experimental setup allows the measurements of the high spin fraction as the function of temperature, light intensity, and pressure. The experimental FORC diagrams obtained in <b>compression</b> and <b>releasing</b> modes show significant differences which are in disagreement with the classical Preisach model. Also, stronger kinetic effects are evidenced in the compression mode and possible explanations of this effect considering the viscoelastic behavior are provided...|$|R
5000|$|In 2001 the WR400F's {{engine was}} uprated {{and it became}} the WR426F {{increasing}} the displacement to [...] for greater power and throttle response. A beefier YZ style clutch basket and plates than those on the WR400 improved clutch performance. Frame geometry was identical to the 2002 YZ250 and YZ426F with a 58.7 inch wheelbase and 14.7 inches of ground clearance. This was the last WR {{to make use of}} a manual <b>compression</b> <b>release</b> for starting.|$|E
50|$|A <b>compression</b> <b>release</b> {{mechanism}} {{works to}} ease the starting of internal combustion engines {{by allowing them to}} spin up to starting speed without having to work against the pumping action of the pistons. It does this through a release valve that is incorporated within the cylinder head that vents the cylinder pressure to the outside atmosphere until the engine has sufficient momentum to overcome it. At that point the valve closes and the ignition is engaged.|$|E
50|$|Diesel <b>compression</b> <b>release</b> brake {{controls}} {{consist of}} an on/off switch and, often, a multi-position switch {{that controls the}} number of cylinders on which the brake is active. Throttle and clutch switches are integral with the system. Activation occurs when both the clutch is released with transmission in gear and the throttle is released. It is the driver's job to ascertain the correct transmission gear to use depending on, for example, the steepness of the grade and whether the truck is loaded or empty.|$|E
40|$|Uniaxial strain impact {{experiments}} {{have been performed}} to obtain shock <b>compression</b> and <b>release</b> response of a 0. 22 g/cm{sup 3 } polyurethane foam in a configuration where the foam impacts a thin target witness plate. Wave profiles from a suite of ten {{experiments have}} been obtained, where shock amplitudes range from 40 to 500 MPa. A traditional p-{alpha} porous material model generally captures the material response.

40|$|International audienceDiscrete element {{simulations}} {{are employed}} {{to study the}} influence of static friction on the mechanical response of assemblies of nonbonded semiflexible fibers during cycles of isostatic <b>compressions</b> and <b>releases.</b> Hysteresis is evidenced during the cycles and {{is related to the}} sensitivity of the frictional contacts on normal forces. Nonzero frictions are shown to decrease both the packing density and caging number but do not affect the critical exponents that characterize the pressure and bulk and shear moduli. Assemblies of frictionless fibers are found fragile {{in the sense that they}} resist isostatic compressions but have a zero shear modulus at all densities...|$|R
