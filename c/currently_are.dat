The first Jews arrived from Haifa, British Palestine (now Israel), in the 1940s because they were denied entry to Palestine by the British Government.

5|$|The National Development Plan for the Utilisation of Oil Shale 2008–2015 {{describes}} {{oil shale}} {{as a strategic}} energy resource. Other mineral resources in Estonia that are mined <b>currently</b> <b>are</b> peat, dolostone, clays, limestone, sand and gravel. Potentially mineable resources include granite, iron ore and phosophorite.|$|E

A large number of the Alvarado family have been, or <b>currently</b> <b>are</b> professional wrestlers, including family patriarch Shadito Cruz and uncles who worked under the ring names Brazo de Plata, El Brazo, Brazo Cibernético. Brazo de Platino and Súper Brazo. Many of Felipe Alvarado's cousins are also wrestlers including Psycho Clown, Máximo Sexy and Goya Kong among others.

5|$|This bipedal ornithopod {{is known}} from several partial skeletons and skulls that {{indicate}} it grew to between 2.5 and 4.0meters (8.2 to 13.1ft) in length on average. It had sturdy hind limbs, small wide hands, {{and a head}} with an elongate pointed snout. The form of the teeth and jaws suggest a primarily herbivorous animal. This genus of dinosaur {{is regarded as a}} specialized basal ornithopod, traditionally described as a hypsilophodont, but more recently recognized as distinct from Hypsilophodon. Several species have been suggested for this genus. Three <b>currently</b> <b>are</b> recognized as valid: the type species T. neglectus, T. garbanii and T. assiniboiensis.|$|E
5|$|Hiʻiaka orbits Haumea nearly circularly every 49days. Namaka orbits Haumea in 18 {{days in a}} {{moderately}} elliptical, non-Keplerian orbit, and as of 2008 was inclined 13° with respect to Hiʻiaka, which perturbs its orbit. Because the impact that created the moons of Haumea {{is thought to have}} occurred in the early history of the Solar System, over the following billions of years it should have been tidally damped into a more circular orbit. Namaka's orbit has likely been disturbed by orbital resonances with the more-massive Hiʻiaka due to converging orbits as they moved outward from Haumea due to tidal dissipation. They may have been caught in and then escaped from orbital resonance several times; they <b>currently</b> <b>are</b> in or at least close to an 8:3 resonance. This resonance strongly perturbs Namaka's orbit, which has a current precession of its argument of periapsis by about −6.5° per year, a precession period of 55 years.|$|E

25|$|Although Estonia is {{in general}} resource-poor, the land still offers a large variety of smaller resources. The country has large oil shale and {{limestone}} deposits, along with forests that cover 48% of the land.

25|$|Other {{proposals}} for alleviating {{the pressure on}} New Street station have also been suggested. These include the lengthening of trains, however, this has been criticised by Arup who claim {{that there are many}} stations that are unable to take trains any longer than they <b>currently</b> <b>are.</b> They used the Cross-City Line as an example, showing that stations can currently take a maximum of six carriages and that the lengthening proposals would increase train length to 12 carriages.|$|E
25|$|Currently most Marinas on {{the lake}} don't have Automatic Identification System {{monitoring}} stations that transmit boat positions to the AIS websites for the boating community. A substantial number of vessels {{on the lake}} do not have AIS transponders as there <b>currently</b> <b>are</b> no mandatory requirements for AIS usage for this body of water. Extra precautions must be taken with respect to boating safety, as the fractal nature of the lake's hydrologic surface area can allow vessels with limited charting equipment to become easily lost.|$|E

The city of Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia and despite not being in a wine region (although a portion of the Penedès is in the greater comarca of Barcelona) it is {{the focal point of the}} Catalan wine industry: a primary consumer market, its port provides export functions and a source of financial resources and investment.|$|E
