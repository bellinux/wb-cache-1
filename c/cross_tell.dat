With barely a glance {{backward}} at British attempts to found settlements on the northern coast in the 1820 s and 1830 s, or forward to the period under Commonwealth control after 1911, he details the distinctively South Australian style of colonisation and how it fared in these northern lands. From the outset, the South Australian administrators attempted to develop the Territory along the Wakefieldian lines of systematic colonisation which had guided the foundation of their own province.

50|$|Considered one of {{the most}} {{beautiful}} of all Old English poems is Dream of the Rood, contained in the Vercelli Book. The presence of a portion of the poem (in Northumbrian dialect) carved in ruinson an 8th century stone cross found in Ruthwell, Dumfriesshire, verifies the age of at least this portion of the poem. The Dream of the Rood is a dream vision in which the personified <b>cross</b> <b>tells</b> the story of the crucifixion. Christ appears as a young hero-king, confidant of victory, while the cross itself feels all the physical pain of the crucifixion, as well as the pain of being forced to kill the young lord.|$|R

60|$|George Eliot's {{means of}} access to books were very full. She knew French, German, Italian, and Spanish accurately. Greek and Latin, Mr. <b>Cross</b> <b>tells</b> us, she could read with {{thorough}} delight to herself; though after the appalling specimen of Mill's juvenile Latinity that Mr. Bain has disinterred, the fastidious collegian may be sceptical of the scholarship of prodigies. Hebrew was her favourite study {{to the end of}} her days. People commonly supposed that she had been inoculated with an artificial taste for science by her companion. We now learn that she took a decided interest in natural science long before she made Mr. Lewes's acquaintance, and many of the roundabout pedantries that displeased people in her latest writings, and were set down to his account, appeared in her composition before she had ever exchanged a word with him.|$|R

60|$|Here, {{some steps}} from the cathedral {{on the top of}} the slope was the chief {{grandeur}} of the view. A noble old carved granite cross, eight or ten feet high, stood upon the brow, bending slightly to one side, and beyond lay the valley cherishing its treasure of the twin lakelets, girt in by the band across them, nestled in the soft lining of copsewood and meadow, and protected by the lofty massive hills above. In front, but below, and somewhat to the right, lay another enclosure, containing the ivied gable of St. Mary's Church, and the tall column-like Round Tower, both with the same peculiar golden hoariness. The sight struck Lucilla with admiration and wonder, but the next moment she heard the guide exhorting Rashe to embrace the stem of the <b>cross,</b> <b>telling</b> her that if she could clasp her arms round it, she would be sure of a handsome and rich husband within the year.|$|R
60|$|When Mary was {{twenty-one years}} old the family again moved, {{this time to}} Foleshill Road, near Coventry. Here she became acquainted with the family of Charles Bray, a prosperous ribbon manufacturer, whose house was a {{gathering}} place for the freethinkers of the neighborhood. The effect of this liberal atmosphere upon Miss Evans, {{brought up in a}} narrow way, with no knowledge of the world, was to unsettle many of her youthful convictions. From a narrow, intense dogmatism, she went to the other extreme of radicalism; then (about 1860) she lost all sympathy with the freethinkers, and, being instinctively religious, seemed to be groping after a definite faith while following the ideal of duty. This spiritual struggle, which suggests that of Carlyle, is undoubtedly the cause of that gloom and depression which hang, like an English fog, over much of her work; though her biographer, <b>Cross,</b> <b>tells</b> us that she was not by any means a sad or gloomy woman.|$|R
