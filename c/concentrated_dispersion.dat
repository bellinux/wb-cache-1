40|$|The {{high-frequency}} rheology of <b>concentrated</b> liquid charge-stabilized <b>dispersions</b> {{has been}} measured using a surface-loaded torsional resonator. The high-frequency shear moduli are {{extracted from the}} measurement {{as a function of}} ionic strength and surface acid content. A theory which enables the determination of the effective surface charge of the <b>concentrated</b> <b>dispersions</b> is presented. At high ionic strengths the theory simplifies to an analytic formula relating the effective surface charge to the high-frequency limiting shear modulus in terms of an effective hard-sphere diameter. The effective hard-sphere diameter is obtained experimentally from the high concentration asymptote of the zero-shear viscosity. The resulting effective surface charge increases with added electrolyte content in agreement with charge renormalization theory. The effective charge also increases with added weak and strong surface acid content. The method, which operates on <b>concentrated</b> <b>dispersions,</b> is found to yield effective charges that agree with dilute measurements of the electrophoretic mobility. Moreover, the effective hard-sphere scaling reduces the high-frequency viscosity to a master curve independent of salt content...|$|R
40|$|The {{sedimentation}} velocity of uncharged, nonaggregated silica spheres under gravity is strongly reduced after addition of {{small amounts of}} nonsedimenting small spheres.

This adsorption also screens effectively any weak Van der Waals attraction between the large spheres, which despite its weakness, significantly influences the concentration dependence of settling in a pure solvent.

40|$|A new {{criterion}} {{is introduced}} for {{the onset of}} shear thickening in a <b>concentrated</b> <b>dispersion.</b> The criterion follows from the assumption that shear thickening occurs when the shear forces overrule the interparticle forces. A force balance at small interparticle distances is used to predict the dependence of this critical shear rate on the volume fraction. It is deduced that the critical shear rate {{is proportional to the}} interparticle distance, has a linear dependence on the magnitude of the stabilizing force, an inverse linear dependence on the dispersion medium viscosity, and an inverse linear dependence on the particle radius. The model is confirmed experimentally with viscosity measurements on various electrostatically stabilized dispersions. The validity of the model is also checked with data obtained from the literature.

Our results showed that the inhomogeneity should be characterized by the difference between the ensemble average scattering intensity and the dynamic component of the time average scattering intensity. The inhomogeneity was strongly dependent on the sol-gel transition rate and the gelling temperature. Our results have also revealed that the inhomogeneity can be completely suppressed if individual swollen microgels are closely packed together, indicating that the static nonergodic behavior originates from large voids formed during the sol-gel transition...|$|E

This choice of solvent {{leads to an}} efficient dispersion polymerization, with polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) occurring via the growing PBzMA block to produce a range of PLMA−PBzMA diblock copolymer nano-objects, including spheres, worms, and vesicles. In the present study, particular {{attention is paid to}} the worm phase, which forms soft free-standing gels at 20 °C due to multiple inter-worm contacts. Such worm gels exhibit thermo-responsive behavior: heating above 50 °C causes degelation due to the onset of a worm-to-sphere transition. Degelation occurs because isotropic spheres interact with each other much less efficiently than the highly anisotropic worms. This worm-to-sphere thermal transition is essentially irreversible on heating a dilute solution (0. 10 % w/w) but is more or less reversible on heating a more <b>concentrated</b> <b>dispersion</b> (20 % w/w).

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{stability}} of colloidal dispersions is of crucial importance because {{the properties of}} dispersions are strongly affected by the degree of coagulation. Whereas the coagulation kinetics for quiescent (i. e., nonstirred) and diluted systems is well-established, the behavior of <b>concentrated</b> <b>dispersions</b> subjected to shear is still not fully understood. We employ the discrete element method (DEM) for the simulation of coagulation of <b>concentrated</b> colloidal <b>dispersions.</b> Normal forces between interacting particles are described {{by a combination of}} the Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek (DLVO) and Johnson, Kendall, and Roberts (JKR) theories. We show that, in accordance with the expectations, the coagulation behavior depends strongly on the particle volume fraction, the surface potential, and the shear rate. Moreover, we demonstrate that the doublet formation rate is insufficient for the description of the coagulation kinetics and that the detailed DEM model is able to explain the autocatalytic nature of the coagulation of stabilized dispersions subjected to shear. With no adjustable parameters we are able to provide semiquantitative predictions of the coagulation behavior in the high-shear regions for a broad range of particle volume fractions. The results obtained using the DEM model can provide valuable guidelines for th...|$|R

The apparent shear viscosity of the dispersions was calculated at volume fractions ranging from 0. 31 to 0. 56. Shear-thinning behavior was clearly observed at high volume fractions. The low- and high-limiting viscosities were then estimated from the apparent viscosity by fitting these data into a semi-empirical formula. Furthermore, the short-time motions were examined for Brownian particles fluctuating in concentrated dispersions, for which the fluid inertia plays an important role. The mean square displacement was monitored in the vorticity direction at several different Peclet numbers and volume fractions so that the particle diffusion coefficient is determined from the long-time {{behavior of}} the mean square displacement.

The steady-shear behavior of three types of stirred yogurt with varying ropiness was investigated experimentally. To describe the shear-dependent viscosity, a microrheological model was used which was developed for weakly aggregating dispersions. This model was capable of successfully describing the steady-state viscosity as a function of shear rate of the stirred yogurts, the protein concentration of which ranged between 2. 0 % and 3. 9 %. The value of the fractal dimensionality df, following from the model for the aggregates is about 2. 24, which was similar to the value of df found with other methods. Moreover, realistic values were found for the interaction forces (energies) describing interaction between the aggregates. The calculated size of the aggregates was close to the size found before by applying different experimental techniques.

40|$|Individual colloids often carry {{a charge}} {{as a result}} of the {{dissociation}} (or adsorption) of weakly-ionized surface groups. The magnitude depends on the precise chemical environment surrounding a particle, which in a <b>concentrated</b> <b>dispersion</b> is a function of the colloid packing fraction η. Theoretical studies have suggested that the effective charge Z_eff in regulated systems could, in general, decrease with increasing η. We test this hypothesis for nonpolar dispersions by determining Z_eff(η) over a wide range of packing fractions (10 ^- 5 <η< 0. 3) using a combination of small-angle X-ray scattering and electrophoretic mobility measurements. We find a complex dependence of the particle charge as a function of the packing fraction, with Z_eff initially decreasing at low concentrations before finally increasing at high η. We attribute the non-monotonic density dependence to a crossover from concentration-independent screening at low η, to a high packing fraction regime in which counterions outnumber salt ions and electrostatic screening becomes η-dependent. The efficiency of charge stabilization at high concentrations may explain the unusually high stability of concentrated nanoparticle dispersions which has been reported.
