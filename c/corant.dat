Os materiais utilizados foram as resinas compostas específicas para restauração em dentes posteriores: Prodigy Condensável@ (KerrISybron) e Alert@ (JenericlPentron); resinas compostas para utilização em dentes anteriores e posteriores: Z 100 @ (3 M) e Definite@ (Degussa) e o selante de superficie Protect-It@ (JenericlPentron). Para avaliação da rugosidade de superficie, 10 corpos-de-prova de cada {{material}} foram confeccionados à temperatura de 23 Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the internal porosity, the surface roughness of posterior composite resins submitted on mechanical toothbrushing and the efficency of methods for superficial smoothness recuperation. The materials evaluated were two posterior composite resms: Prodigy Condensable@ (Kerr/Sybron) and Alert@ (Jeneric/Pentron); two universal composite resins: Z 100 @ (3 M) and Definite@ (Degussa) and the surface penetrating sealant Protect-It@ (Jeneric/Pentron). For the measurement of surface rourghness, ten specimens of each material were made at 23 :t 1 °C of room temperature and 50 :t 5 % of relative humidity, using metallic matrice (2 mm in height, 4 mm in diameter). After 24 hours, the specimens were polished using Sof-Lex system@ (3 M) and one of the surfaces was covered with the surface sealant. AlI the specimens were taken to the rugosimeter (Surfcorder SE 1700) to examine the initial surface roughness, before the mechanical toothbrushing at constant speed of 250 strokes per minute, during 2 hours, totalizing 30. 000 cyc 1 es. The surface roughness was then measured one more time, one of the surfaces was recovered with the surface sealant and this surface was examined again. On the other surface, two more measurements were made, one after the repolishing and other after the surface sealant application. For evaluation of porosity, the specimens were _cut with silicon disc, inc 1 uded in chemical acrillic resin, abrasioned with sandpapers (200, 400 and 600) and immersed in Nankin <b>corant</b> (Acrilex) for 12 hours. The porosity was quantified in a stereoscopic microscopy Carl-Zeiss (Germany), with 64 x of magnification, and the percentual area was calculated using the Adobe Photoshop 4. 0 programo The results were subject to analysis of variance and to Tukey' s test at 5 % significant leveI and showed that: (1) the roughness surface increased in all of the materiais after the mechanical toothbrushing, except Prodigy Condensable@; (2) Alert@ showed the most roughness surface; (3) the surface penetrating sea 1 ant decreased the roughness after the mechanical toothbrushing for Alert@ and Definite@ without any effect for Z 1 O 0 @ and Prodigy Condensable@; (4) the best method for superficial smoothness recuperation after abrasion specia 11 y for the Alert@; (5) Alert@ showed the most porosity, followed by Prodigy was the repolishing, which can be associated with the application of surface sealant, Condensable@, when compared with Definite@ and ZlOO...|$|E

5000|$|The {{majority}} of the eighty-nine works within Drexel 5611 are dance works. Of these dance works, sixty-seven carry titles which clearly indicate their dance associations. The other sixteen contain dance characteristics but are either untitled or titled [...] "Toy" [...] (nos. 12, 13, 27), [...] "For the hand" [...] (nos. 68, 70, 71), [...] "First, second, third" [...] (nos. 28, 29, 31) and two have unique titles ("Gerrard's Tune" [...] no. 30 and [...] "Queen's Command" [...] no. 67). Combining designated works with those exhibiting particular dance characteristics, Klakowich observed that Drexel 5611 contains 31 almands, 43 <b>corants,</b> 8 sarabands, and 1 galliard. Before no. 77 Klakowich observes that organization of movements is not consistent. But after no. 77, he observes {{the frequency of the}} three-movement organization almand-corant-saraband. This three-movement organization also exists with the works by Benjamin Rogers (nos. 32-34) and a four-movement structure for the works by Mercure (nos. 42-45).|$|R
40|$|According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), {{in vitro}} and in vivo assays (human populations exposed) have {{demonstrated}} that some dyes used in the coloring process {{can be considered as}} mutagenic and carcinogenic. Epidemiological studies in occupationally exposed people indicated an association with risk of bladder cancer and lymphoid malignancy. As well, the personal use of hair dyes has been associated to bladder cancer. Almost 33 % of women, over 18 years and 10 % of men, with more than 40 years, use some kind of hair dye. The black dye is a semipermanent colorant composed by mixture of several tinctures that include two pure colorants (Basic Red 51 and Basic Brown 17), both of these are azo-dyes (-N=N-), and a mixture known as Arianor Ebony, composed by other five dyes, among the are the azo-corants and anthraquinones (Basic blue 99, Basic brown 16, Acid violet 43, Basic red 76, and Basic yellow 57). The azo-corants are considered hazardous substances, due to production of aromatic amines on their degradation; these amines can be more toxic than the original compounds. The anthraquinones dyes are widely used for plastics staining and are known for their mutagenic, carcinogenic and toxic effects if ingested. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the cytotoxicity (Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide test-MTT), genotoxicity (Comet assay and Micronucleus) of all <b>corants</b> that compose the black capillary dye, through tests performed with cellular cultures of human hepatome (HepG 2), as well as the evaluation of mutagenic properties of the mixture (Ames test), using Salmonella typhimurium. Also, was evaluated the expression of 7 different apoptose genes. The results obtained in this study has demonstrated that the Basic Red 51 (BR 51), Basic Brown 17 (BB 17), Arianor Ebony and the capillary mixture of dyes induced genotoxic effects on the exposed cells, including the DNA fragmentation and the formation of the MN. The [...] . Segundo a Agência Internacional para Pesquisa do Câncer (IARC), estudos utilizando ensaios in vitro e in vivo (populações humanas expostas) demonstraram que algumas tinturas de cabelo e muitos produtos químicos utilizados no processo de tingimento capilar podem ser considerados mutagênicos e carcinogênicos. Estudos epidemiológicos em pessoas expostas ocupacionalmente a tinturas de cabelo indicaram uma associação com risco de câncer de bexiga e neoplasias linfoides. Da mesma forma, o uso pessoal de corantes capilares permanentes foi associado com câncer de bexiga. Cerca do 33 % das mulheres, com mais de 18 anos de idade e 10 % dos homens com mais de 40 anos, usam algum tipo de corante de cabelo. A tintura capilar preta é uma coloração semipermanente, que é composta por uma mistura de vários corantes, incluindo dois corantes puros (Basic red 51 e Basic brown 17), ambos azo corantes (- N=N-) e uma mistura, denominada Arianor Ebony, composta por cinco corantes, dentre eles azo corantes e antroquinonas (Basic blue 99, Basic brown 16, Acid violet 43, Basic red 76, and Basic yellow 57). Os azo corantes são considerados substâncias perigosas, pois a sua degradação gera produtos como aminas aromáticas que podem ser mais tóxicas que os compostos originais. Os corantes de antraquinona são amplamente utilizado para a coloração de plásticos e tintas industriais conhecidos por serem mutagênicos, carcinogênicos e tóxicos por via oral. Este projeto de pesquisa teve como objetivo geral avaliar a citotoxicidade (teste do Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide- MTT), genotoxicidade (ensaios de Cometa e Micronúcleos) de todos os corantes que compõem a tintura capilar preta, por meio de ensaios realizados com cultura de células de hepatoma humano (HepG 2), assim como também avaliar a mutagênicidade da mistura (teste de Ames), pelo teste com Salmonella typhimurium nas linagens TA 98 e TA 100.
