30|$|On {{the other}} hand, in the {{cellular}} network, dual <b>access</b> <b>calls</b> in the cellular-only area, cellular-only calls, horizontal handoff calls, and upward vertical handoff calls all {{compete for the}} same resource in the cellular network. We categorize these calls into (1) new <b>calls</b> including dual <b>access</b> <b>calls</b> blocked in the WLAN, (2) horizontal handoff, and (3) vertical handoff calls from the WLAN to the cellular networks. Dual <b>access</b> <b>calls</b> in the cellular-only area, cellular-only <b>calls,</b> and dual <b>access</b> <b>calls</b> blocked in the WLAN are eventually blocked if they are blocked in the cellular networks. Hence, these calls are classified into the same category. Upward vertical handoff calls are treated with the highest priority because of similar reasons with downward vertical handoff calls. Horizontal handoff calls have medium priorities since the dropping of these calls causes degradation in user satisfaction but horizontal handoffs do not need more signaling messages than vertical handoffs.|$|R
